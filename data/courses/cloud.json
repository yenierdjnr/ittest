          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:09.464\n[SOUND]\n\n2\n00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:10.246\nIn this video,\n\n3\n00:00:10.246 --> 00:00:14.050\nwe're gonna be looking at CompTIA's\nCloud+, and I have Don Pezet here.\n\n4\n00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.368\nDon, tell us a little bit about Cloud+.\n\n5\n00:00:16.368 --> 00:00:20.620\n>> The Cloud+ certification is one of the\nnewer certifications to come from CompTIA.\n\n6\n00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.990\nAnd it's designed to help certify and\n\n7\n00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.330\nvalidate your knowledge in\nthe area of cloud computing.\n\n8\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.580\nCloud's a big buzzword right now,\na lot of people are deploying these.\n\n9\n00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.130\nAnd they're deploying public clouds\nlike with Amazon Web Services,\n\n10\n00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.600\nMicrosoft Azure, Google Compute,\nthose type technologies.\n\n11\n00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.620\nAnd they're also deploying private clouds,\nclouds\n\n12\n00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.000\nthat you build in your own organization\nwith technologies like VMware VSphere,\n\n13\n00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.650\nMicrosoft's Hyper-V, Citrix Xenserver,\nthose types of technologies.\n\n14\n00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.550\nWell, you have to have a certain amount of\nknowledge to support that infrastructure\n\n15\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.000\nand that's exactly what CompTIA's Cloud+\ncovers, is making sure that\n\n16\n00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.820\nyou've got the necessary knowledge and\nskills to manage the servers yourself or\n\n17\n00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.730\nto determine when you\nshould outsource that and\n\n18\n00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.340\nlet one of the big cloud providers\non the internet handle that.\n\n19\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.670\nAnd even how to do a hybrid between the\ntwo, where you manage some resources and\n\n20\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.790\nthey manage others.\n\n21\n00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.550\nWell obviously there is a lot of\nresponsibility that comes in whichever\n\n22\n00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.360\nmodel you choose and so\nthat's exactly what we cover in Cloud+.\n\n23\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.440\nAll the underlying hardware technologies,\n\n24\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.420\nthe software,\nthe logistics of deploying the technology.\n\n25\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.640\nIt's very different from the traditional\nphysical server model, and\n\n26\n00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.250\nso the Cloud+ is designed\nto create that separation.\n\n27\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.850\nIt's not the old way of doing things,\nit's a new way, and\n\n28\n00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.418\nhere's all the different\ntechnologies you might see.\n\n29\n00:01:37.418 --> 00:01:41.310\n>> Don, now Cloud+,\nwith all the CompTIA exams,\n\n30\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.000\nthey always have a certain target audience\n\n31\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.790\nWith Cloud+ can you tell us a little bit\nabout, who is the target on this one?\n\n32\n00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.520\n>> If we pull up the official exam\nguide from CompTIA here, basically they\n\n33\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.105\nstate what they're looking for is that\nif you're gonna be jumping into Cloud+,\n\n34\n00:01:57.105 --> 00:02:02.035\nthey expect you to already be Network+\nand/or CompTIA Storage+ certified, right?\n\n35\n00:02:02.035 --> 00:02:05.625\nThey expect you to already have some\nexperience with supporting networking.\n\n36\n00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.325\nAnd networking applies in storage and\nregular networks.\n\n37\n00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:10.975\nIt's not required, but\nthey want you to have that knowledge.\n\n38\n00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:12.805\nSo you should already\nbe familiar with that.\n\n39\n00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:17.830\nThey also want you to have 24 to 36 months\nof work experience in IT networking.\n\n40\n00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.320\nThis is not designed for\nsomebody who's brand new to IT.\n\n41\n00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.770\nThis is designed for\nsomebody who's already in the IT world,\n\n42\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.530\nis already working with systems,\nmaybe locally, maybe in the cloud,\n\n43\n00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.120\nthat wants to know more, that wants\nto be ready for that new technology.\n\n44\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.850\nIn IT, things change so fast and\nif you're not updating your skills,\n\n45\n00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.110\nyou can become outdated very,\nvery quickly.\n\n46\n00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.460\nYour skill set becomes outdated and\n\n47\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.070\nthat makes you less marketable\nas an IT professional.\n\n48\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.300\nWell, Cloud+ is focused on what's new,\nthe new way of doing things,\n\n49\n00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.690\njumping into those technologies and\nembracing them, and so\n\n50\n00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.540\nthat's why it's geared towards\npeople that are already in IT.\n\n51\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.420\nThat already have that Network+ level of\nknowledge so that we can jump right in and\n\n52\n00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.400\nfocus on the important stuff, the what's\nnew, the virtualization technologies, and\n\n53\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.280\nnot have to focus on things like,\nhey, here's how we do subnetting.\n\n54\n00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.220\nWe should already know that\nknowledge by this point.\n\n55\n00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.070\n>> As with every CompTIA exam,\n\n56\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.290\nthere's gonna be a series of\nobjectives you have to know.\n\n57\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.370\nDon, here in Cloud+,\n\n58\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.860\nwhat are some of the topics that we can\nexpect to learn across this journey?\n\n59\n00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.560\n>> Well they break everything\nup across seven domains, and\n\n60\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.160\nI've got it here on the slide where,\nbasically each topic is pretty important.\n\n61\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.330\nAnd I know on some CompTIA exams you'll\nhave where one domain counts for\n\n62\n00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.620\n40% of the exam but in Cloud+ it's\nactually a pretty even distribution.\n\n63\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.830\nWe start with just cloud concepts and\nmodels.\n\n64\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.730\nA lot of people have misunderstanding\nof what a cloud is, and and\n\n65\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.060\nthey just automatically assume it means\nsomething like Amazon Web Services.\n\n66\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.210\nBut you have private clouds that are\nentirely internal that are just in your\n\n67\n00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.200\norganization.\n\n68\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.570\nAnd so we talk about those\ndifferent concepts and models,\n\n69\n00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.380\nthe different implementations\nthat you may see out there.\n\n70\n00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.120\nThen we do virtualization.\n\n71\n00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.480\nWhat is virtualization, and why would\nwe wanna go to a cloud when we've got\n\n72\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.970\nperfectly good physical servers already?\n\n73\n00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.950\nAnd so we cover that,\nwe cover what's that big difference and\n\n74\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.210\nwhy one gives us advantages over another.\n\n75\n00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.220\nThen we talk about our infrastructure.\n\n76\n00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.230\nWhat resources do I have to have\navailable to make this all work?\n\n77\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.790\nI'm gonna need different hardware,\n\n78\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.816\ndifferent networking, different storage\nthan a traditional server environment, and\n\n79\n00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:15.380\nso we take a look at\nthat infrastructure too.\n\n80\n00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.550\nIn domain four we've got\nresource management.\n\n81\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.500\nWhen we start lumping all of our servers\ninto this virtual environment it's\n\n82\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.550\neasy to lose track of how much RAM, CPU,\nnetwork and disk resources that we've got.\n\n83\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.060\nAnd we've got to be able to manage\nall of that and keep track of it and\n\n84\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.422\nkeep everything healthy.\n\n85\n00:04:30.422 --> 00:04:33.950\nAnd it's just a different world from\nthe old physical model where everything\n\n86\n00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.170\nhad dedicated resources.\n\n87\n00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.930\nDomain five is one of the more\nimportant ones, which is security.\n\n88\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.930\nWhen you start deploying this\nstuff into a cloud environment,\n\n89\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.270\nif it's a public cloud you can be at risk,\nand so\n\n90\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.790\nwe need to make sure we've secured\nour systems, that we've taken\n\n91\n00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.600\nthe necessary precautions to minimize\nour security risk in our attack surface.\n\n92\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.950\nAnd so we cover our topics too.\n\n93\n00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.160\nAs the show starts to wind down,\nwe get into the systems management.\n\n94\n00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.290\nOnce everything's up and running, we're\nnot just done, we don't walk away and\n\n95\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.310\ncall it a job done.\n\n96\n00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.690\nNow we've gotta keep it running.\n\n97\n00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.090\nSo how do we manage those systems and\nkeep them healthy and operational,\n\n98\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.860\nmonitoring performance and all that?\n\n99\n00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.750\nAnd then the last one, in domain seven,\n\n100\n00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.870\nwe cover what's really\nthe shining gem of a cloud.\n\n101\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.930\nWhen you have a cloud,\n\n102\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.510\nit is really easy to build in business\ncontinuity, disaster recovery,\n\n103\n00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.510\nresilience, high availability, we can\nbuild all of that into our infrastructure.\n\n104\n00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.190\nSo that we could lose a hard drive,\na power supply, a server,\n\n105\n00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.155\nan entire building, and still have our\nservices available to our customers.\n\n106\n00:05:35.155 --> 00:05:37.710\nThat we can have very\nhigh levels of redundancy\n\n107\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.920\nwith minimal commitment to hardware.\n\n108\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.300\nIt makes solutions that weren't\npossible for companies ten years ago,\n\n109\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.280\npossible even for companies with small\nbudgets, it's really neat stuff.\n\n110\n00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.254\nAnd those are all the different topics\nthat we're gonna be seeing on this exam.\n\n111\n00:05:51.254 --> 00:05:55.626\n>> So you've hit the books,\nyou've hit the internet, you've studied,\n\n112\n00:05:55.626 --> 00:06:00.286\nyou've gone through the motion of\nhopefully viewing us here at ITProTV, and\n\n113\n00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:03.880\nnow it's time to sit in the hot seat and\ntake the exam.\n\n114\n00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.600\nDon, how will we go\nabout taking that exam?\n\n115\n00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.150\n>> Well, the exam itself, it's a digital\nexam, you take it on a computer.\n\n116\n00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.000\nIt's a multiple choice exam for\nthe most part.\n\n117\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.190\nThere's some drag and\ndrop questions, things like that.\n\n118\n00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.390\nBut you can't just take\nit on your own computer.\n\n119\n00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.620\nYou have to go to\na Pearson Vue Testing Center.\n\n120\n00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.620\nSo Pearson Vue Centers,\nthey're all over the world.\n\n121\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.210\nIf you go to their website, it's vue.com.\n\n122\n00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.350\nIf you go to vue.com, you can do\na search for a test center right there,\n\n123\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.060\nyou'll find one in your local area.\n\n124\n00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.830\nYou can call them, schedule the exam,\nand go to take it.\n\n125\n00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.480\nAnd I've got the exam details here.\n\n126\n00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.288\nThe exam number is CV0-001,\nthat's the exam that you wanna take.\n\n127\n00:06:40.288 --> 00:06:45.060\nAnd it's 100 questions, so it's not so\nbad, but you've only got an hour and\n\n128\n00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.860\na half, you got 90 minutes.\n\n129\n00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.720\nNot if you look at that,\nthat's less than a minute per question.\n\n130\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.600\nSo when you get to this exam,\nyou need to know your answers.\n\n131\n00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.840\nThis isn't a, I'm gonna sit here and\n\n132\n00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.920\nponder it and think about it,\nI've got 50 seconds,\n\n133\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.390\nor whatever, per question to answer, and\nmake sure that I get through it on time.\n\n134\n00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.340\nIt's graded on a scale of 100 to 900,\nand a 750 is passing.\n\n135\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.210\nSo, you've got, where you can get\nsome questions wrong and still pass.\n\n136\n00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.980\nYou don't have a perfectionist, but\na 750's still a pretty high number.\n\n137\n00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.700\nWe need to make sure that\nwe know our material.\n\n138\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.140\nAnd so, when you go to the Vue's website\nand you find that local testing center, so\n\n139\n00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.250\nI'm just gonna go here to For\ntest takers, and once we're in here,\n\n140\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.100\nwe can tell it what exam we wanna take,\nand I'll just punch in CompTIA.\n\n141\n00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.210\nAnd then over here,\n\n142\n00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.852\nwe can create an account for free,\nand we can start to go and test.\n\n143\n00:07:33.852 --> 00:07:39.050\nWe can do a Find a test center, and I can\nlocate that test center that's near me.\n\n144\n00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.470\nSo we can pick a city.\n\n145\n00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:46.120\nLet's pick somewhere,\nI don't know, we'll do London.\n\n146\n00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.950\nI guess that's a really big city but\nwell either way we can just do London.\n\n147\n00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.700\nAnd so we'll do a search for\n\n148\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.160\nthat and it's gonna show me, well there's\nmore than one city called London.\n\n149\n00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.120\nLet's go with London,\nOhio that can't be too big of a city.\n\n150\n00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.460\nAnd we can click on that and\nI can see that in London,\n\n151\n00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.000\nOhio which apparently is a big city cuz we\ngot five different Vue centers in there\n\n152\n00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.740\nthat you can go and take that exam.\n\n153\n00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.550\nSo you pick your center, sign up for\nthe exam, pay your money and\n\n154\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.400\nthen go and pass it and\nget your certification.\n\n155\n00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.940\nWell, if all that sounds\nexciting to you and\n\n156\n00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.680\nyou're ready to jump in and start\nlearning about cloud technologies and\n\n157\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.080\nin the Cloud+ in general,\nyou're in the right place.\n\n158\n00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.220\nStay tuned,\nwe've got episodes coming up next.\n\n159\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.080\nIf you're not quite ready, if you don't\nmeet those minimum requirements, for\n\n160\n00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.198\nexample, check out\nthe rest of our library.\n\n161\n00:08:27.198 --> 00:08:31.070\nWe've got Network+, we did a great series\non that where you can jump right in with\n\n162\n00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.400\nno experience necessary,\ncatch that content.\n\n163\n00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.082\nAnd then when you finish Network+,\nyou can come right back over here,\n\n164\n00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:37.350\nCloud+ will be waiting for you.\n\n165\n00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.690\nDefinitely check it out.\n\n166\n00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.422\nBut for those of you continuing\non with us, stay tuned,\n\n167\n00:08:41.422 --> 00:08:43.411\nnew episodes of Cloud+ coming up next.\n\n",

They start by describing what a cloud service is as well as the ideas of accountability and responsibility. Then they explore the common cloud models which include Software as as Service(SaaS), Platform as a Service(PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS). Finally they look at some of the less common cloud services like CaaS, DaaS, and XaaS.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:19.637\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode, we are continuing on, well,\n\n4\n00:00:19.637 --> 00:00:20.596\nwe're not continuing.\n\n5\n00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:23.323\nActually beginning our\nCloud+ from CompTIA series,\n\n6\n00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.404\nhopefully you guys are gonna enjoy that.\n\n7\n00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:29.740\nAnd joining us in the studio today is none\nother than our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.310\nDon, welcome to the show sir,\nhow are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.240\n>> I am doing great, Daniel,\nthanks for having me here and\n\n10\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.620\nI am excited to kick this off.\n\n11\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.670\nJumping into Cloud+,\nit is a exciting topic to learn about.\n\n12\n00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.800\nEverybody hears this, companies\nare moving into the cloud, new services\n\n13\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.400\nare always deployed into the cloud,\nand for the most part, you're right.\n\n14\n00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.200\nThis is the direction\nthat things are going.\n\n15\n00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.660\nSo if you found your way here\nto this show, believe me,\n\n16\n00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.220\nyou're in the right place to\nbe future proofed, right.\n\n17\n00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.500\nThis is the way that companies are moving.\n\n18\n00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.600\nSo we're gonna start things off\nreally just from the ground up.\n\n19\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.720\nSo if you haven't worked with cloud\nservices at all, don't worry about it,\n\n20\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.728\nwe've got you covered.\n\n21\n00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:05.980\nWe're gonna move through the very\nearly stages of this, and\n\n22\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.988\nget a chance to see exactly\nwhat even a cloud service is.\n\n23\n00:01:08.988 --> 00:01:12.193\nThat's what we're starting with right here\nin this episode, what a cloud service is,\n\n24\n00:01:12.193 --> 00:01:14.808\nwhat the different terminology is,\nthings that we need to be aware of.\n\n25\n00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:17.320\nAnd then we're gonna move into\nthe more advanced things later on.\n\n26\n00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.500\nBut in this episode,\nthe focus is on what is the cloud?\n\n27\n00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.330\nAnd If you already have an idea like,\n\n28\n00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.910\nhey I stick my servers up\nin remote data center.\n\n29\n00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.640\nGreat, that's accurate.\n\n30\n00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.815\nBut there's several different\ntypes of cloud deployment and\n\n31\n00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:33.090\nCompTIA expects you to know them all for\nthe exam, so\n\n32\n00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.460\nwe're gonna run through those and\nget a chance to see them right here.\n\n33\n00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.990\n>> That's right.\n\n34\n00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.810\nThere's a few different\nmodels that we need to cover.\n\n35\n00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.810\nAnd like Don said, the terminology is\nactually gonna be very key because\n\n36\n00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.020\nwe want to be able to speak in cloud-ese,\nright?\n\n37\n00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.520\nWe want to be able to have\nto explain everything.\n\n38\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.420\nSo that's what we're gonna do now,\n\n39\n00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.535\nwe're gonna explain what\nthese terminologies are.\n\n40\n00:01:51.535 --> 00:01:52.775\nWhat these different models are so\n\n41\n00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:56.045\nthat as we move through these episodes,\neverything starts to make sense.\n\n42\n00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:57.795\nYou have to build a good foundation so\n\n43\n00:01:57.795 --> 00:02:00.265\nthat all the other information\nactually makes since to you.\n\n44\n00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:01.925\nSo I guess that's a good place to start,\nDon.\n\n45\n00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:05.410\nLet's move into these cloud models and\nwhat should we know about them and\n\n46\n00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.540\nthe terminology that goes along with it?\n\n47\n00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.480\n>> All right, now, cloud models, right,\n\n48\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.550\nthis is one of the key things\nwe need to understand.\n\n49\n00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.430\nWell, it's not models that happen to be in\nthe cloud, cuz there's plenty of those.\n\n50\n00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.960\nIt's talking about the different ways that\nwe can implement IT services in the cloud\n\n51\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.390\nand to understand the different\nways in what they mean,\n\n52\n00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.730\nwe really need to understand what\nlife was like before the cloud.\n\n53\n00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.638\nSo let's take a look at\na traditional implementation model.\n\n54\n00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:31.298\nLet's say that I had\na web-based application, right?\n\n55\n00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:36.176\nWhich most softwares these days is being\ndeveloped for the Web, because it's so\n\n56\n00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:38.698\nmuch more flexible for clients, right?\n\n57\n00:02:38.698 --> 00:02:40.563\nJust take out Microsoft Office,\nfor example,\n\n58\n00:02:40.563 --> 00:02:43.034\nin the past if you wanted\nMicrosoft Office, you had to go out and\n\n59\n00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:46.130\nyou had to buy a copy of the software, and\nyou had to install it on your machine.\n\n60\n00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.330\nThen you had to update it and\nkeep it running, and\n\n61\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.830\nyou can happen to be using somebody else's\nmachine, you didn't have Office anymore.\n\n62\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.460\nBecause it was back on your machine,\nright?\n\n63\n00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.178\nIt was tied to that one local install.\n\n64\n00:02:56.178 --> 00:02:59.738\nBut now we have Microsoft Office 365,\nit's on a webpage.\n\n65\n00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:02.107\nAnd I can go to any computer in\nthe world that has a Web browser and\n\n66\n00:03:02.107 --> 00:03:03.606\nI can browse through the page, login.\n\n67\n00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:06.213\nAnd now I've got the full Office\nsuite available to me right there,\n\n68\n00:03:06.213 --> 00:03:07.046\nvia the Web browser.\n\n69\n00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:09.246\nThat's how a lot of services are running.\n\n70\n00:03:09.246 --> 00:03:13.967\nEmail, Office Productivity Suites,\ncommunications like voice over IP,\n\n71\n00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:15.966\nall being application driven.\n\n72\n00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:19.190\nNow you can deploy Web applications\nin your own local environment without\n\n73\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.886\nusing the cloud, and it looks a little bit\nlike the model I've got here on my laptop.\n\n74\n00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:26.101\nSo let's take a look at this diagram\nthat I've kinda got worked up here, and\n\n75\n00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:28.526\nthis is the traditional\nimplementation model, right?\n\n76\n00:03:28.526 --> 00:03:32.060\nLet's say I need a Web application,\nso I'm gonna need a Web server.\n\n77\n00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.530\nAnd on that Web server,\nI'm going to need my application, and\n\n78\n00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.680\nit kind of breaks down like this.\n\n79\n00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.730\nFirst off, I need physical infrastructure.\n\n80\n00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.370\nAnd that physical infrastructure,\nthat's going to be things like routers and\n\n81\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.100\nswitches.\n\n82\n00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.720\nYou could throw in firewalls,\nIPS, other network devices, but\n\n83\n00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.670\nsomething that's gonna create\nmy network connectivity.\n\n84\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.230\nI'm going to need power, UPS,\nuninterruptible power supplies, and\n\n85\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.380\ngenerators.\n\n86\n00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.690\nIf power goes out UPSs will keep\nme running for a little while.\n\n87\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.670\nBut if the power outage is extended I'm\ngonna need generators to really keep\n\n88\n00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.740\nthat going.\n\n89\n00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.130\nI'm gonna need physical security to\nkeep people away from my servers.\n\n90\n00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.380\nIf they can get into the building,\nget into the server room,\n\n91\n00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.470\nI can really have some issues there.\n\n92\n00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.190\nAnd I need heating and cooling.\n\n93\n00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.150\nHeating not so much in server rooms these\ndays but sometimes you still need it,\n\n94\n00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.400\ncooling absolutely.\n\n95\n00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.190\nYou gotta keep the server rooms cool.\n\n96\n00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.778\nSo this is all physical\ninfrastructure that I've gotta have.\n\n97\n00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:22.038\nThen I bring in my server hardware.\n\n98\n00:04:22.038 --> 00:04:26.067\nAnd the server hardware, that's gonna be\nphysical servers that I purchase from\n\n99\n00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:29.263\nwhoever it is that we purchase from,\nHP, Dell, IBM, Lenovo,\n\n100\n00:04:29.263 --> 00:04:31.298\nwhoever it is that you buy servers from.\n\n101\n00:04:31.298 --> 00:04:33.618\nYou've got warranties you have\nto track on that server, right.\n\n102\n00:04:33.618 --> 00:04:34.920\nYou wanna keep it under maintenance.\n\n103\n00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.990\nThat way if something goes wrong,\nyou get replacement parts.\n\n104\n00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.760\nYou gotta monitor it for\nfailure and for performance.\n\n105\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.780\nIf it starts to get overburdened\nyou gotta bring in better hardware.\n\n106\n00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.930\nYou got firmware to maintain.\n\n107\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.928\nYou gotta keep the hardware up to date.\n\n108\n00:04:47.928 --> 00:04:51.562\nAnd you gotta have spares available,\nor a redundancy of some sort,\n\n109\n00:04:51.562 --> 00:04:54.068\nin case you have a physical\nhardware failure.\n\n110\n00:04:54.068 --> 00:04:57.228\nOn top of that server hardware,\nyou get your operating system.\n\n111\n00:04:57.228 --> 00:04:58.930\nAnd that might be Linux or Windows or\n\n112\n00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.734\nwhatever operating system it is you\nchoose to run, but that operating system,\n\n113\n00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:06.535\nyou've got to install it, configure it,\nmonitor it, update it, right, all\n\n114\n00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:10.508\nthe routine things that are part of the\nlife cycle of running an operating system.\n\n115\n00:05:10.508 --> 00:05:13.560\nAnd then on top of that operating system,\nyou've got your actual application.\n\n116\n00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.720\nThe whole point of this was\nto provide a Web app, and\n\n117\n00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.960\nit's really sitting on top of all\nof this other infrastructure.\n\n118\n00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.210\nSo with the Web app, we've got to\ninstall it, configure it, monitor it and\n\n119\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.990\nupdate it just like the operating system.\n\n120\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.230\nAnd there might even be\none extra step in here.\n\n121\n00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.510\nIf it's an in-house developed application,\ncuz then we got to develop it and\n\n122\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.120\nthere's a whole series of\nthings that rotate around that.\n\n123\n00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.680\nBut this is all stuff that's occurring\nwith any kind of Web application that\n\n124\n00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.590\nwe choose or any really application at\nall that we choose to host internally.\n\n125\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.300\nSo If you wanna set up your own\nemail server, our own Web server,\n\n126\n00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.580\nyour own file server, these things\nthey're requiring them for structure and\n\n127\n00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.320\nthis is what it looks like.\n\n128\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.410\nWhen we go to the cloud,\nall we're doing is just taking one or\n\n129\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.520\nmore of these pieces and\nmoving them off to a third party.\n\n130\n00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.100\nAnd letting somebody else\nbe responsible for it.\n\n131\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.350\nNow we used to call this outsourcing, and\n\n132\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.080\noutsourcing really got\na bad connotation to it.\n\n133\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.490\nNobody likes to say that anymore.\n\n134\n00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.770\nBut you're taking pieces of your\ninfrastructure and you're basically\n\n135\n00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.120\noutsourcing it to somebody else,\nsomebody else who can do it better, and\n\n136\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.378\ndo it cheaper than you, right,\nand do it more reliably.\n\n137\n00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.740\nSo those are all kinds of key pieces\nof putting something into the cloud.\n\n138\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.470\nAnd as an IT guy,\nyou might be resistant to that.\n\n139\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.660\nI know a lot of IT guys that\nare out there that say ooh,\n\n140\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.650\nI want to keep my servers\nright here with me.\n\n141\n00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.820\nI don't want to put them in the cloud.\n\n142\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.180\nThat's my job, I maintain these,\nI can do it better than anybody else.\n\n143\n00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.490\nAnd that very well may be true.\n\n144\n00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.760\nRight and there is a certain,\nwe'll see later on in this series,\n\n145\n00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.830\nthere are times where you need to do that,\nyou need to keep the servers close to you.\n\n146\n00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.880\nBut more often than not,\n\n147\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.490\nyou'll find that you can move\nthese services up into the cloud,\n\n148\n00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.370\nlet somebody else take care of it, and\nthen you can focus in on other activities.\n\n149\n00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.640\nI don't know a single IT\nperson who sits around and\n\n150\n00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.560\nsays, boy I got a little\nextra time on my hands.\n\n151\n00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.168\nRight, I know I stay busy all the time.\n\n152\n00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:00.228\nI always have.\n\n153\n00:07:00.228 --> 00:07:02.608\nAnd there's always stuff to work on.\n\n154\n00:07:02.608 --> 00:07:04.760\nIt would be nice to be freed\nup to work on that stuff.\n\n155\n00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.243\nAnd with cloud services, we can have them\ntake away the menial, just redundant\n\n156\n00:07:09.243 --> 00:07:14.690\ntasks that we perform on any given basis\nby kinda outsourcing this, all right.\n\n157\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.520\nSo, when we talk about\ngoing to a cloud service,\n\n158\n00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.790\nwhat we're really doing is picking how\nmuch of this control we want to give up.\n\n159\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.470\nAnd that's going to lead us\ninto our first cloud models and\n\n160\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.150\nCompTIA really stresses the cloud models.\n\n161\n00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.850\nThey want you to know the cloud models\n\n162\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.080\nas defined by the National Institute\nof Standards and Technology or NIST.\n\n163\n00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.130\nSo NIST is a US government organization,\n\n164\n00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.260\npart of the US Department of Commerce,\nand they put out a publication,\n\n165\n00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.090\nI'll put the link to this in the show\nnotes so you guys can have it.\n\n166\n00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.210\nBut, they put out a publication\nwhere they define\n\n167\n00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.290\nthe different models of cloud computing.\n\n168\n00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.520\nNow, they only define,\nis it three or four models?\n\n169\n00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.370\nso let's see if I can get down to it here.\n\n170\n00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.555\nThey only define a few models.\n\n171\n00:07:54.555 --> 00:07:57.906\nAnd you'll find that once you get out\non the Internet that there are tons of\n\n172\n00:07:57.906 --> 00:07:59.799\ndifferent models that are out there, but\n\n173\n00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:03.447\nthey really focus in on, I believe it's\nthree, yeah, three primary models.\n\n174\n00:08:03.447 --> 00:08:07.128\nAnd the models are this,\nit's Software as a service,\n\n175\n00:08:07.128 --> 00:08:11.085\nplatform as a service, and\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n176\n00:08:11.085 --> 00:08:13.540\nOkay?\nEach one of these is a different level of\n\n177\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.670\ncontrol that we're giving\naway to somebody else.\n\n178\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.850\nAnd CompTIA wants you to know\nthe definition of these models\n\n179\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.610\nas specified by NIST.\n\n180\n00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.430\nRight?\nCuz this is the way\n\n181\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.150\nthat it's gonna show up on the exam.\n\n182\n00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.720\nAnd you don't actually have to read this\nwhole document if you don't care to.\n\n183\n00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.510\nThere's really only a few pieces of\ninformation you need to get out of here.\n\n184\n00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.490\nThe first thing is what their\ndefinition of cloud computing is,\n\n185\n00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.190\nwhich really boils down to this\none very long sentence, right?\n\n186\n00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:43.351\nAnd it just says cloud computing is a\nmodel for enabling ubiquitous, convenient,\n\n187\n00:08:43.351 --> 00:08:48.528\non-demand network access to a shared pool\nof configurable computing resources.\n\n188\n00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:51.424\nLike network servers,\nstorage, applications and\n\n189\n00:08:51.424 --> 00:08:53.925\nservices that can be\nrapidly provisioned and\n\n190\n00:08:53.925 --> 00:08:58.510\nreleased with minimal management effort or\nservice provider interaction.\n\n191\n00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.590\nAll right, that sentence right there, that\nis NIST's definition of cloud computing.\n\n192\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.830\nThey're not specifically calling\nout these magical data centers or\n\n193\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.770\nglobal delivery or anything like that.\n\n194\n00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.230\nThey're really calling out the fact\nthat you can rapidly provision stuff,\n\n195\n00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.320\nthat there's not this huge\ndelay in rolling something out.\n\n196\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.470\nAnd that it can be done with minimal\nmanagement effort and that we don't\n\n197\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.949\nnecessarily have to have service provider\ninteraction to get this to happen.\n\n198\n00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:25.587\nIt's got to be quick, easy, fast, right?\n\n199\n00:09:25.587 --> 00:09:29.220\nAnd that's what cloud is all about.\n\n200\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.780\nAnd so, that's how the NIST defines it.\n\n201\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.130\nAnd then, when you choose\nthe model that you implement.\n\n202\n00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.110\nWell, that's where things start\nto get a little different.\n\n203\n00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.100\nYou choose how much of that\ncontrol you want to give away.\n\n204\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.730\nAnd the more control you give away, the\nfaster, the more reliable this gets but\n\n205\n00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.010\nthe more limitations\nthat get imposed on you.\n\n206\n00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:47.710\nRight?\n\n207\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.850\nSo, one of the fastest, quickest,\n\n208\n00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:55.310\nmost stable models is this very first one,\nsoftware as a service.\n\n209\n00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.220\nAnd with software as a service,\n\n210\n00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.400\nwhat you're effectively doing is giving\naway all the control to a third party.\n\n211\n00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.710\nSo, let's take email as an example, right,\nevery company has email these days.\n\n212\n00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.150\nAnd so you say, boy I wanna set up email.\n\n213\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.140\nI want to have an email server and\nemail accounts for all of my employees.\n\n214\n00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.525\nWell, in the past, you could install\nLinux and you could bring up send mail or\n\n215\n00:10:17.525 --> 00:10:21.450\nDovecot or whatever and have email\nserver up and running in short order.\n\n216\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.288\nRight?\n\n217\n00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:25.230\nOr, you could fire up Microsoft Windows\nand do Microsoft Exchange on there and\n\n218\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.420\nnow you've got email up and running.\n\n219\n00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.940\nAgain, in short order.\n\n220\n00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.460\nBut now you've got services and\ninfrastructure that you support,\n\n221\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.260\nyou have to maintain.\n\n222\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.090\nYou've got to go back to my model\nthat I showed a moment ago.\n\n223\n00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.467\nYou've got to get that hardware,\nand the software.\n\n224\n00:10:37.467 --> 00:10:39.811\nYou've got to maintain and\nsupport all of it, right?\n\n225\n00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:43.190\nOr, I could go to Google.\n\n226\n00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.980\nAnd I can sign up for\nGoogle Apps for Business.\n\n227\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.510\nAnd we could deploy email for\nour company through Google Apps.\n\n228\n00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.160\nRight?\n\n229\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.950\nAnd with Google Apps for Business, they\ngive all of your employees Gmail accounts.\n\n230\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.590\nAnd you never even see a server, you\nhave no idea where the servers even are.\n\n231\n00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:01.830\nYou just create user accounts.\n\n232\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.310\nAnd when the users log in, they just\ngo to mail.google.com, or gmail.com, or\n\n233\n00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.100\nwherever.\n\n234\n00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.100\nThey log in and there's their email.\n\n235\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:09.610\nAll right.\n\n236\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.390\nNo client has to be\ninstalled on their computer.\n\n237\n00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.720\nNo server configuration has to be done\nby us other than adding the user.\n\n238\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.540\nWe don't have to back up the database.\n\n239\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.910\nWe don't have to do any of that.\n\n240\n00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:25.370\nGmail is entirely composed\nof Google services.\n\n241\n00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.510\nBut we don't see any of it.\n\n242\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.800\nWe just get to consume the application.\n\n243\n00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.780\nSo looking at this model right here,\n\n244\n00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.600\njust using email as the example,\nI don't see any physical infrastructure.\n\n245\n00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.720\nGoogle takes care of all that.\n\n246\n00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.220\nIt's Google's data centers,\ntheir hardware, their servers, their UPS,\n\n247\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.150\ntheir generators,\ntheir routers, their switches.\n\n248\n00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.760\nWe don't see any of it.\n\n249\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.100\nThe server hardware.\n\n250\n00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.130\nYou have no idea what server you're\nrunning on or even where it is.\n\n251\n00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.680\nIt could be in Atlanta.\n\n252\n00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.980\nIt could be in Moscow.\n\n253\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.720\nYou don't know.\n\n254\n00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.090\nOn top of that, you don't know what\noperating system it's running on.\n\n255\n00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.560\nYou go to the Gmail website and\n\n256\n00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.080\nyou log into your mailbox,\nyou don't see an operating system.\n\n257\n00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.920\nYou're not involved in that process.\n\n258\n00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.940\nAnd then, the application software itself.\n\n259\n00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.050\nI don't know what mail server Google uses.\n\n260\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.430\nMaybe they have an in\nhouse one they wrote.\n\n261\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.694\nMaybe they're just using SendMail or\n\n262\n00:12:11.694 --> 00:12:15.440\none of the other email\nservers that are out there.\n\n263\n00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.520\nThey can use really whatever they want.\n\n264\n00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.830\nSo I don't know.\n\n265\n00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.520\nIt's all hidden from me.\n\n266\n00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.910\nAt the end of the day,\nI just get an application.\n\n267\n00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.500\nAnd do I ever have to do\na security update to Gmail?\n\n268\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.910\nNo Google does it.\n\n269\n00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.790\nDo I ever have to upgrade to\nthe new version of Gmail?\n\n270\n00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:32.990\nNo they do it.\n\n271\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.440\nRight?\nThe only thing we have to do is\n\n272\n00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.180\nlog in and use it.\n\n273\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.330\nAnd maybe we've got some\nuser settings we adjust.\n\n274\n00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.430\nI want to change the theme of my mail box,\nor create some inbox rules, or\n\n275\n00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.380\ncreate folders.\n\n276\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.290\nThose are just user options,\nuser settings.\n\n277\n00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:45.800\nRight?\n\n278\n00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.870\nThat kind of stuff you expect.\n\n279\n00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:51.170\nAnd actually if I remember right,\nthe NIST, they actually account for that.\n\n280\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.150\nLet's see.\nBlah, blah, blah, yeah.\n\n281\n00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.985\nRight here.\n\n282\n00:12:52.985 --> 00:12:54.240\n[LAUGH] I shouldn't say blah, blah, blah.\n\n283\n00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.390\nIt is actually good information.\n\n284\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.670\nBut they go in here and\n\n285\n00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.960\nspecify that basically everything is\nbeing managed by the third party.\n\n286\n00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.640\nIt's accessed through a thin\nclient like a web browser.\n\n287\n00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.560\nAnd then it goes on to say\nthat we're not responsible.\n\n288\n00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.800\nThe consumer, the person buying\nthis service is not responsible for\n\n289\n00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.820\nnetwork, servers, operating systems,\n\n290\n00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.120\nstorage, underlying cloud infrastructure,\nnone of that, with the possible exception\n\n291\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.500\nof limited user specific\napplication configuration settings.\n\n292\n00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.340\nYou might want to change your theme,\n\n293\n00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.210\nchange the colors of those bars,\nand you can do that.\n\n294\n00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.120\nRight?\n\n295\n00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.190\nBut the server, you don't touch that.\n\n296\n00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:31.060\nAnd that's a key aspect of Software\nas a Service, right, SaaS.\n\n297\n00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.800\nAnd the SaaS model is one of the models\nthat's really, really attractive.\n\n298\n00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.300\nBecause as a CIO,\nas a chief information officer for\n\n299\n00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.010\na company, you wanna have the most\nstable services possible.\n\n300\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.080\nIf you bring up your own mail\nserver you might only have one or\n\n301\n00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.305\ntwo employees that can monitor it.\n\n302\n00:13:46.305 --> 00:13:51.180\nBut Gmail, Google's got thousands\nof employees that are monitoring.\n\n303\n00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.840\nAnd not just the employees that\nare available in the local talent pool in\n\n304\n00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.360\nwhatever city you live in, but\n\n305\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.695\nemployees all over the globe who\nare the best at what they do.\n\n306\n00:13:59.695 --> 00:14:02.025\nThey can afford that cuz\nthey're a massive company.\n\n307\n00:14:02.025 --> 00:14:03.505\nAnd I'm using Gmail as an example.\n\n308\n00:14:03.505 --> 00:14:08.075\nThe same thing goes for Yahoo Mail or\nMicrosoft's Office 365, or\n\n309\n00:14:08.075 --> 00:14:12.155\nZimbra, or any of the other\nvarious services out there.\n\n310\n00:14:12.155 --> 00:14:14.225\nThey are on a massive scale.\n\n311\n00:14:14.225 --> 00:14:17.655\nThey have hundreds of thousands of\nmailboxes, millions of mailboxes.\n\n312\n00:14:17.655 --> 00:14:19.985\nSo they can afford the best\nstaff possible to support that.\n\n313\n00:14:19.985 --> 00:14:22.670\nThey can do a better job than you can,\nin most cases.\n\n314\n00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.320\nYou, the viewer of this episode,\n\n315\n00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.315\nyou might be the expert on mailboxes and\nthen first of all, congratulations.\n\n316\n00:14:28.315 --> 00:14:30.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But secondly,\n\n317\n00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:34.110\nyeah you're qualified to host your own\nsystems but even you might not want to.\n\n318\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:38.860\nI do this where we have systems at\nITProTV where I know I could manage it.\n\n319\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.943\nBut I just don't have\ntime to deal with it.\n\n320\n00:14:39.943 --> 00:14:43.295\nAnd so I'd rather somebody else dealt\nwith it to free me up to do other things,\n\n321\n00:14:43.295 --> 00:14:44.770\nlike filming these shows.\n\n322\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.730\nSo just because you can do something,\ndoesn't mean you should.\n\n323\n00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.220\nAnd SasS, Software as a Service,\nlet's us do that.\n\n324\n00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.870\nSome of the key things to remember.\n\n325\n00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.160\nCompTIA calls this out specifically,\nthey call out accountability and\n\n326\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:57.890\nresponsibility.\n\n327\n00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:58.990\nAll right.\n\n328\n00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.270\nAccountability.\n\n329\n00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:05.510\nThat means who it is that's going to be\nin trouble if a service doesn't work.\n\n330\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.858\nRight?\nWho's accountable when something doesn't\n\n331\n00:15:07.858 --> 00:15:09.040\nfunction.\n\n332\n00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.810\nAnd responsibility is who's responsible\nfor making it function in the first place.\n\n333\n00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:13.430\nOkay.\n\n334\n00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.650\nNow those sound pretty similar, but\nyou might have one person responsible for\n\n335\n00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.160\nmaking it work.\n\n336\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.970\nAnd then another person who gets in\ntrouble when something doesn't work.\n\n337\n00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.600\nAnd you see this pretty often\nwith service providers,\n\n338\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.200\nwhere you've got the engineering team\nthat makes the service available.\n\n339\n00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.650\nBut at the day, if your service isn't\navailable, then it's the sales team,\n\n340\n00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.880\nor whoever your sales contact\nis that actually gets penalized,\n\n341\n00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.270\nand has to reimburse you, or\ncredit your account, or whatever.\n\n342\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.480\nBut whenever you look at a cloud service,\n\n343\n00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.950\nyou need to think about what you are going\nto be accountable and responsible for.\n\n344\n00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.950\nAnd the software as a service?\n\n345\n00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.910\nYou're not really accountable for\nanything, except for paying the bill.\n\n346\n00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.760\nAs long as you pay your bill every month,\n\n347\n00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.120\nthe service provider takes\ncare of every aspect.\n\n348\n00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.310\nAnd that's really attractive.\n\n349\n00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.350\nThat's a big benefit of going\nup with a cloud service.\n\n350\n00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.661\nNow, there's negatives, right?\n\n351\n00:16:01.661 --> 00:16:04.226\nNot everybody is too keen\non going to the cloud.\n\n352\n00:16:04.226 --> 00:16:08.598\nSome people are paranoid, and so\nthey have unrealistic expectations But\n\n353\n00:16:08.598 --> 00:16:12.561\nthere is a very real reason why you\nmight not want to go to the cloud.\n\n354\n00:16:12.561 --> 00:16:17.380\nAnd one of the big key reasons is\nsomething called multitenancy, right?\n\n355\n00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.510\nWhen you build your own email server,\nso I bring up a server right here\n\n356\n00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.910\nin the ITProTV studios, I start creating\nmailboxes on it, I own that server.\n\n357\n00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.860\nThe only mailboxes that are on\nthat server are ITProTV mailboxes.\n\n358\n00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.970\nWe have 100% exclusive\naccess to the hardware.\n\n359\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:38.380\nBut when I create a Gmail mailbox or an\nOffice 365 mailbox or a Zimbra mailbox, my\n\n360\n00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:44.020\nmailbox is being placed on a server in the\ncloud, right alongside other customers.\n\n361\n00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.290\nMaybe even my direct competitors,\nI don't know.\n\n362\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.670\nYou're isolated, you're partitioned and\nseparated, so there's that.\n\n363\n00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.510\nBut you are on shared hardware and\nit's called multitenancy.\n\n364\n00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:57.880\nYou have more than one tenant on that same\npiece of hardware that services them.\n\n365\n00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.230\nAnd, there's a little bit of risk there.\n\n366\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.440\nThere's a risk that somebody could figure\nout an exploit that allows them to jump\n\n367\n00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.350\nthat wall, right?\n\n368\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:07.370\nTo cross that partition and be able to\njump from their virtual infrastructure to\n\n369\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:08.300\nyour virtual infrastructure.\n\n370\n00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.340\nIt's something that's constantly\nreviewed by the CIA and a couple other\n\n371\n00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.070\norganizations and they tell us that it's\nsafe, but there's always that risk, right?\n\n372\n00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:19.586\nSo that's one risk that you have\nwith going with a cloud service.\n\n373\n00:17:19.586 --> 00:17:22.968\n>> So when you DDOS server, I mean, not\nthat you would ever do anything like that,\n\n374\n00:17:22.968 --> 00:17:26.655\njust because they're a direct competitor,\nbut you would be DDOSing your own server,\n\n375\n00:17:26.655 --> 00:17:28.597\nbecause you could be\nsharing that resource.\n\n376\n00:17:28.597 --> 00:17:30.385\n>> Yeah an that happens.\n\n377\n00:17:30.385 --> 00:17:34.313\n>> Maybe not attacking yourself but, there\nmay be another customer that's ticked off\n\n378\n00:17:34.313 --> 00:17:36.610\nsomebody and they start getting attacked.\n\n379\n00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.690\nAnd you become collateral\ndamage as a part of that.\n\n380\n00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.700\nThat is a risk with cloud services.\n\n381\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.080\nAnd so if you want dedicated hardware\nthat you can guarantee the security of,\n\n382\n00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.130\nthen it's best not to go up\ninto the cloud like this.\n\n383\n00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.930\nNot to use one of these Software\nas a Service solutions.\n\n384\n00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.460\nBut it is a great solution.\n\n385\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.990\nDefinitely something\nthat you wanna look into.\n\n386\n00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:59.730\nNow, Software as a Service, the other\nnegative it has is functionality.\n\n387\n00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.700\nWhen you go software as a service the\nthird party is providing the software, and\n\n388\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.420\nthey're providing the functionality.\n\n389\n00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.000\nAnd if you come up with a new idea for\na new feature or something you'd like to\n\n390\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.630\nchange, you're at their mercy whether or\nnot they'll implement it.\n\n391\n00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.750\nSome providers are really good about that.\n\n392\n00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.310\nGoogle, I love Google,\n\n393\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.720\nbut no other company ignores their\ncustomer quite like Google does.\n\n394\n00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.770\nJust go to a Google forum and\n\n395\n00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.460\nyou will see how it's amazing\nhow they ignore everybody.\n\n396\n00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.550\nIf you see Gmail and you use it,\nmaybe your company had 50.000 employees,\n\n397\n00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:33.420\nthey've all got these Google apps for\nbusiness accounts and you look at it and\n\n398\n00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.710\nyou go, boy, I really wish those\nemails would support PGP signatures.\n\n399\n00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:39.600\nOkay?\n\n400\n00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.490\nHow hard is it to\nimplement PGP signatures?\n\n401\n00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.820\nIt's not hard at all.\n\n402\n00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.580\nIf you go into Google's\nfeature request list or\n\n403\n00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.850\nwhatever, it was requested\nover ten years ago.\n\n404\n00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.980\nIt's got thousands of votes on it for\npeople wanting it, and\n\n405\n00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:55.150\nGoogle has never even\nresponded a single time to it.\n\n406\n00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.250\nThat's where you're at their mercy.\n\n407\n00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.880\nOne day, somebody at Google will sit down\nand say boy let's offer this feature, and\n\n408\n00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.680\nif they choose to do it,\nthey will, and you'll get it.\n\n409\n00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.560\nBut otherwise you're\ncompletely at their mercy.\n\n410\n00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.470\nSo use the ability to change core\nfunctionality of the system, right?\n\n411\n00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.030\nThat's being hosted by them.\n\n412\n00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:15.050\nBut the exchange is, what you get in\ntrade-off is they manage everything.\n\n413\n00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.550\nSo I don't have to stay up\nlate at night wondering\n\n414\n00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.990\ndid my mail server get backed up?\n\n415\n00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.500\nOr, ooh, mail server's down.\n\n416\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.460\nLet me go in there and\nfigure out what's going on.\n\n417\n00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.950\nNo, we just sit back and go,\nooh, mail server's down.\n\n418\n00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.520\nSucks to be them, and\nthey'll get it up as soon as they can.\n\n419\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.720\nSo that's the tradeoff we get with SaaS.\n\n420\n00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.260\n>> Well it definitely seems like there\nare certain times when you would want to\n\n421\n00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.810\nimplement a SaaS solution, and other times\nwhen you probably would not because well,\n\n422\n00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.530\nif I'm putting all my\neggs in the SaaS basket,\n\n423\n00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.120\nI'm at the mercy of my SaaS provider.\n\n424\n00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.540\nIf I have a service that might not be so,\nwhere I need that more control,\n\n425\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.110\nwell I'm probably not going\nto want to with SaaS.\n\n426\n00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.810\nYou've got to remember these\naren't a one size fits all thing.\n\n427\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:59.360\nThey're there as an option for\nus to use and implement as we need them,\n\n428\n00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.400\nnot a necessity that, well,\nthe SaaS is there, I've gotta use SaaS.\n\n429\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.080\nAnd sometime we don't\nwanna be at that mercy.\n\n430\n00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.910\nNow Don, is there anything else\nabout SaaS that we need to know?\n\n431\n00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.500\n>> Not really, and it kinda transitions\nus really well into the next one,\n\n432\n00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.110\nwhich is Platform as a Service.\n\n433\n00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.370\nMaybe I want the benefits of cloud, but\n\n434\n00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.760\nI still wanna maintain control\nof that software, right?\n\n435\n00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.500\nSo I wanna have an email server, but\nI wanna control cuz I wanna be able to\n\n436\n00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.480\nimplement features that\nI want in the software.\n\n437\n00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.680\nBut boy,\nI don't wanna deal with the hardware.\n\n438\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.820\nI don't wanna deal with the cooling and\nthe data center.\n\n439\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.910\nI don't wanna have to\ndeal with that stuff.\n\n440\n00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.990\nI really just want somebody\nelse to manage that.\n\n441\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.640\nMaybe I don't even want to manage\nthe operating system, and I say,\n\n442\n00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.440\nboy it'd be nice if they just took care\nof the operating system also, right?\n\n443\n00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.730\nI have a web application that\nI have written in PHP and\n\n444\n00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.060\nI just wanna roll that out,\nand I wanna worry about PHP.\n\n445\n00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.830\nI wanna worry about the piece that\nI know and not this other stuff.\n\n446\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.670\nAnd that's what Platform as a Service is.\n\n447\n00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:53.755\nPlatform as a Service, if we go back\nto the model I drew, this model.\n\n448\n00:20:53.755 --> 00:20:57.887\nWith Platform as a Service, the hosting\nprovider, the cloud provider takes care of\n\n449\n00:20:57.887 --> 00:21:01.496\nthe physical infrastructure,\ntake care of the server infrastructure,\n\n450\n00:21:01.496 --> 00:21:05.920\nthey take care of the operating system and\nall that's left is the application.\n\n451\n00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.180\nAnd you take care of the application.\n\n452\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.080\nYou upload the app into their\ncontainer and off it runs.\n\n453\n00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.190\nYou don't see any of the underlying\ninfrastructure and that's that.\n\n454\n00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.070\nAnd it's a pretty neat system.\n\n455\n00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.091\nSo, for example,\nif we were to take like Amazon.\n\n456\n00:21:20.091 --> 00:21:23.269\nAmazon Web Services,\nthey have a ton of different products.\n\n457\n00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:29.000\nSo this is Amazon Web Services and if you\nlook at their products, they have Compute.\n\n458\n00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.950\nTheir Compute service,\n\n459\n00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:34.980\nlike EC2, the Elastic Cloud Compute, that\none lets you bring up virtual machines.\n\n460\n00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.180\nAnd Amazon takes care of the hardware\ninfrastructure underneath, but\n\n461\n00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.630\nyou take care of the operating system and\nthe application.\n\n462\n00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.200\nBut EC2 Container Registry,\n\n463\n00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.550\nContainer Service, Beanstalk,\nthere's a few other ones that show up.\n\n464\n00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.180\nI guess they're under\na different category.\n\n465\n00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:54.080\nBut Elastic Beanstalk definitely are ones\nwhere you just upload your application and\n\n466\n00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.500\nso you may have a PHP or Pearl,\nor whatever computer language,\n\n467\n00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.810\nC sharp, whatever it is you've\nwritten your application in,\n\n468\n00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.590\nyou upload that application\ninto Elastic Beanstalk and\n\n469\n00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.730\nthey manage all the infrastructure\nunder the hood.\n\n470\n00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.780\nThat's called Platform as a Service and\n\n471\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.970\nit's the next one that NIST calls\nout is that Platform as a Service.\n\n472\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.720\nAnd with this one, it's very similar\nto Software as a Service except\n\n473\n00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.400\nwe still maintain control\nof the application.\n\n474\n00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.650\nThat means we've got to install,\nconfigure, manage,\n\n475\n00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.720\nand update the application.\n\n476\n00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.350\nBut everything under\nthe hood is managed for us.\n\n477\n00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.170\nSo this is a very rapid deployment model.\n\n478\n00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:34.380\nAnd it's something that is very popular\namongst developers, because developers,\n\n479\n00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.770\nthey know their application.\n\n480\n00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.310\nThey know the languages they write in,\nthey know what they're working with,\n\n481\n00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.460\nbut they don't necessarily\nknow the operating system.\n\n482\n00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.480\nThey don't know necessarily Linux,\nor Windows.\n\n483\n00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.030\nI say necessarily because some of dev\nops where they cross the border and\n\n484\n00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.880\nthey do both, but a lot of developers just\nfocus in on the programming languages,\n\n485\n00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.540\nthey don't deal with\nthe underlying operating systems.\n\n486\n00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.480\nPlatform as a Service makes it so\nwe don't have to do that, right?\n\n487\n00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.140\nSo on a positive side,\nwe maintain control of our application and\n\n488\n00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.850\nthe functionality and the extensibility,\nbut the cloud provider\n\n489\n00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.390\ntakes care of the physical\ninfrastructure and the operating system.\n\n490\n00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:11.730\nSo for an accountability and\nresponsibility angle there's a little bit\n\n491\n00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.380\nmore that's taken on by us, in exchange\nfor gaining that extra control.\n\n492\n00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.810\nSo that's Platform as a Service.\n\n493\n00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:23.245\nBut one of the most common models that\nwe're gonna see out in the cloud in\n\n494\n00:23:23.245 --> 00:23:26.795\nIn general is what's called\nInfrastructure as a Service.\n\n495\n00:23:26.795 --> 00:23:28.525\nThis guy right here.\n\n496\n00:23:28.525 --> 00:23:31.975\nWhen you go to Microsoft Microsoft Azure\nand create a virtual machine.\n\n497\n00:23:31.975 --> 00:23:36.695\nWhen you go to Amazon Web Services and\nyou create an instance in their cloud.\n\n498\n00:23:36.695 --> 00:23:38.405\nWhat you're creating is a server,\n\n499\n00:23:38.405 --> 00:23:42.290\na virtual machine and that virtual\nmachine is available for you to use.\n\n500\n00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:47.210\nA new manage the operating system,\nand you manage the applications.\n\n501\n00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.240\nThe cloud provider is just taking\ncare of the lower tear of that model,\n\n502\n00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.940\nthey're taking care of the physical\ninfrastructure and the server hardware.\n\n503\n00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:58.447\nSo, all of this is getting\nmanaged by the cloud provider,\n\n504\n00:23:58.447 --> 00:24:01.392\nyou are now managing\nthe upper part of the stack.\n\n505\n00:24:01.392 --> 00:24:05.844\n>> That means that if something\ngoes wrong like the Heartbleed SSL\n\n506\n00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:08.707\nexploit that happened about a year ago.\n\n507\n00:24:08.707 --> 00:24:10.003\nWhen that happened,\n\n508\n00:24:10.003 --> 00:24:15.150\nyou had to update your open SSL\nlibraries down in your operating system.\n\n509\n00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.160\nWell, the cloud provider doesn't do that.\n\n510\n00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.650\nThe cloud provider takes care of\nthe hardware and the hardware was fine.\n\n511\n00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.550\nIt was a problem in your OS.\n\n512\n00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.540\nSo you had to go and update that OS and\n\n513\n00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.530\nuntil you did,\nyour operating system was vulnerable.\n\n514\n00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.380\nThat your web server was vulnerable.\n\n515\n00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.710\nThat somebody could have connected,\ngot a hold of your private keys and\n\n516\n00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.310\nstarted decrypting your traffic.\n\n517\n00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.470\nYou had to manage that, right.\n\n518\n00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.620\nBut the tradeoff is that you\ndo have complete control now.\n\n519\n00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.940\nYou manage the OS and the application.\n\n520\n00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.200\nIf you need an updated library\ninstalled you just install it.\n\n521\n00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.170\nIf you wanna switch from Linux\nto Windows you do that, right?\n\n522\n00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:51.900\nYou have that control, but it also means\nyou're responsible for a lot more stuff.\n\n523\n00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.760\nNow, there's still a lot of benefits here.\n\n524\n00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.550\nI'm not having to buy physical servers.\n\n525\n00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.550\nI'm not having to deal\nwith a lot of those extra\n\n526\n00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.070\nthings that go on when\nI run my own equipment.\n\n527\n00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:05.000\nAnd we'll talk in another episode about\nthe benefits of going Cloud that you have.\n\n528\n00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.350\nYou really, cost savings,\nadministration savings and\n\n529\n00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.790\nall this still happen here\nwith platform as a service.\n\n530\n00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:14.470\nThis is one of the most common models\nbecause you still have that control, but\n\n531\n00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.230\nyou are kind of outsourcing\nan aspect of it.\n\n532\n00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.960\nSo you still get a lot of the benefits\nwithout having to give up the control.\n\n533\n00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.710\n>> And, Don, this doesn't meant\nthat we are devoid of having any\n\n534\n00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.980\nkind of on premises devices,\nyou can still have those environments and\n\n535\n00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.220\nyou can even mix the two together.\n\n536\n00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:33.750\nSo, it's really give you a lot of\nbenefits, cost to benefit ratio,\n\n537\n00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:37.680\nyou're getting a lot for your money\nwhen it comes to just about any type.\n\n538\n00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:42.410\nOf the service when it comes to Cloud\nservices, very beneficial for us.\n\n539\n00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.110\nI tend to like\nthe infrastructure as a service.\n\n540\n00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.300\nI like being able to say well, I'm gonna\ntake care of the operating system,\n\n541\n00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.080\ntake care of updates and\nlittle things like that.\n\n542\n00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.250\nBut I won't have to buy servers.\n\n543\n00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.090\nI don't have to throw all\nthat stuff on a rack.\n\n544\n00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.480\nI hate racking servers,\n\n545\n00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.140\nthat's one of my banes of my existence is\ntrying to stick a server in somewhere.\n\n546\n00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:03.290\nDon, now these are the three main types\nof of Cloud models that we're gonna see.\n\n547\n00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.080\nAre there any others that we might see?\n\n548\n00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.030\nKind of one offs.\n\n549\n00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.400\n>> Sadly there's a ton.\n\n550\n00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.420\nThey come up with a new\nmodel every week it seems.\n\n551\n00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.335\nSo for the exam COM TA really\nstresses Is the ones defined by NIST.\n\n552\n00:26:15.335 --> 00:26:16.845\nThe three that we just saw, right?\n\n553\n00:26:16.845 --> 00:26:20.455\nSoftware is a service, platform is\na service, infrastructure is a service.\n\n554\n00:26:20.455 --> 00:26:24.405\nMemorize those, know those,\nuse the NIST definition.\n\n555\n00:26:24.405 --> 00:26:27.225\nIf you go out on Google, you'll find\ndifferent people define it different ways.\n\n556\n00:26:27.225 --> 00:26:30.120\nOn the exam,\nit's the NIST model, all right?\n\n557\n00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.070\nBut there are a handful of other\nones that COMT recognizes that\n\n558\n00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.000\nyou want to be familiar with.\n\n559\n00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.710\nAnd I won't spend a ton of time on these,\nbut\n\n560\n00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.750\nI'll just kind of run through them real\nquick, make sure I don't miss any.\n\n561\n00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:43.780\nThere's CAAS, C A A S, which is\ncommunications as a service, right?\n\n562\n00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:49.020\nA great example of this\nwould be Ring Central or\n\n563\n00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.730\nVonage, companies like that where\nthey give you voice over IP service.\n\n564\n00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:54.350\nBut it doesn't just have\nto be voiceover IP.\n\n565\n00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:57.550\nIt could be shared conferencing lines.\n\n566\n00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:01.140\nIt could be screen sharing for\nyou computers, like join.me, those guys.\n\n567\n00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.970\nThose are communications as a service.\n\n568\n00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.800\nAnd if you've never heard of these guys,\nlet me just bring.\n\n569\n00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.260\nI think I've got Ring Central's page open,\nhere we go, Ring Central.\n\n570\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.510\nSo if you've never heard of Ring Central,\n\n571\n00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.610\nthere's ton of providers\nthat are like this.\n\n572\n00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:16.590\nWhere what they do is they\nbasically host a PBX so\n\n573\n00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:21.480\na phone exchange for you, and you can\ndefine phone extensions with numbers and\n\n574\n00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.700\nyou can have physical phones or\nsoftware phones that connect up and\n\n575\n00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.680\npeople can call you and\nit's your whole phone system in the cloud.\n\n576\n00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.620\nSo you can go anywhere in the world and\naccess your phone line, and make calls and\n\n577\n00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.340\nreceive calls and\nsend text messages and all that.\n\n578\n00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:38.860\nAnd they go a little bit further, in that\nthey don't just do the phone service.\n\n579\n00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.620\nThey also do other things,\nlike online meetings,\n\n580\n00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.280\nso you can do shared screens with video or\ndigital voice on top.\n\n581\n00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.020\nThey do video conferencing too.\n\n582\n00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.100\nThey do text messaging and\nfaxing, and so on.\n\n583\n00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.200\nThis is communications as a service, CAAS.\n\n584\n00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.500\nIt's very similar to software as a\nservice, because we don't see the server.\n\n585\n00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.800\nWe don't see the application.\n\n586\n00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.620\nWe don't see the hardware.\n\n587\n00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.560\nAll that's hidden from us, right?\n\n588\n00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.470\nBut they're not giving us software.\n\n589\n00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:03.770\nI guess they sort of do.\n\n590\n00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:06.650\nBut what they're really billing us for\nis the communications aspect.\n\n591\n00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.469\nSo that's CAAS,\ncommunications as a service.\n\n592\n00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.770\nDesktop as a service, DAAS, right.\n\n593\n00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:16.140\nNormally when we talk about cloud services\nwe're talking about servers, right.\n\n594\n00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.160\nThe client is gonna be a laptop or\ntablet or something that I'm using.\n\n595\n00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.270\nBut we can actually have it where\nyour desktop is the service.\n\n596\n00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.170\nAmazon WorkSpaces is\na great example of that.\n\n597\n00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:30.270\nWhere, as a business person, maybe you've\ngot business applications that you run.\n\n598\n00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.470\nMaybe it's QuickBooks, so\nI need QuickBooks available to me.\n\n599\n00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:35.515\nBut I use 10 different computers, and\n\n600\n00:28:35.515 --> 00:28:38.370\nQuickBooks does not like you to\ninstall on more than one computer.\n\n601\n00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.640\nYou've gotta go and\nbuy multiple copies and all that.\n\n602\n00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.160\nSo instead of installing on my computer,\n\n603\n00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.840\nI can get a desktop that's\nhosted in the Cloud.\n\n604\n00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.400\nAnd then, all I have to do\nis install QuickBooks there.\n\n605\n00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:56.530\nAnd when I go to any computer, I can\nremote into this desktop, see my desktop,\n\n606\n00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.220\nsee my applications, and\nstart to work with it.\n\n607\n00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.270\nSo it doesn't matter if I'm on my tablet,\nif I'm on my desktop, on my laptop.\n\n608\n00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:07.090\nI always get the same desktop,\nthe same applications I'm able to work.\n\n609\n00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:08.630\nThat's Desktop as a service.\n\n610\n00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.840\nSometimes it's called VDI,\nVirtual Desktop Infrastructure.\n\n611\n00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.389\nBut desktop as a service is\nkind of a newer name for that.\n\n612\n00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:19.210\nBPAAS, [LAUGH].\n\n613\n00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.130\nIf I can keep it straight here,\n\n614\n00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:26.840\nbusiness process as a service, normally\nwhen we talk about software as a service,\n\n615\n00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.850\nwe're talking about some particular\nsingle piece of software, right?\n\n616\n00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.020\nI used email as an example.\n\n617\n00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.230\nBut email is just one component\nof what a business might do.\n\n618\n00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.290\nAnd so, in businesses we have\nwhat's called a business process.\n\n619\n00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.810\nDaniel and I, we used to work\nat an insurance company and\n\n620\n00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:46.030\nat the insurance company they\nhad a claims department.\n\n621\n00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.670\nAnd when somebody got in a car accident or\na tree fell on their house or\n\n622\n00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.280\nwhatever they would do a claim.\n\n623\n00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.830\nAnd the process of doing a claim\ninvolved more than one system.\n\n624\n00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:59.110\nYou'd get either a phone call or\nan email or\n\n625\n00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.950\na fax that would start the claim process.\n\n626\n00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.760\nSomebody would say look\na tree fell on my house.\n\n627\n00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.730\nAnd then that would go into one system\nwhere we would dispatch an adjuster.\n\n628\n00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:09.170\nThe adjuster would go in the field,\n\n629\n00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:12.770\nevaluate the damage and\nput that into the adjusting system.\n\n630\n00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:16.230\nOnce that got approved for payout,\nit would go to the accounting system.\n\n631\n00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.730\nAnd the accountants would\ngenerate a check, and\n\n632\n00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:21.680\nthe check would get mailed to the insured.\n\n633\n00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.150\nYou'll be able to repair things.\n\n634\n00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.210\nYou've got an adjusting system.\n\n635\n00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.020\nAn accounting system, a physical mail,\nyou've got phone lines.\n\n636\n00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:32.270\nYou've got all these different parts\nthat are part of the business process.\n\n637\n00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:35.500\nSo business process as a service BPAAS.\n\n638\n00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.450\nIs where they put all of those\ncomponents in the Cloud.\n\n639\n00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.700\nNot just email, not just phone,\nnot just adjusting,\n\n640\n00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.820\nnot just accounting, but\nall of it wrapped together.\n\n641\n00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:49.220\nSo if you are gonna open up\na dentist office and you're like,\n\n642\n00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.040\nboy, I need software to run this dentist\noffice, managing my patients and\n\n643\n00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.710\ntracking medical records and\nissuing prescriptions.\n\n644\n00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.100\nYou go online and you can find\nsomebody that has a BPAAS service for\n\n645\n00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.150\ndentist offices.\n\n646\n00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.530\nAnd you get all the various components,\nall the work flows and so\n\n647\n00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:02.770\non wrapped into one.\n\n648\n00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:08.180\nAnd there's plenty of examples out there,\nConstant Contact is a great one.\n\n649\n00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.730\nIf you deal with sales people\nthey'll know constant contact.\n\n650\n00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:17.690\nAnd with Constant Contact what they do\nis they let you track your customers,\n\n651\n00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:20.420\ntrack your purchase history,\nsend our marketing emails,\n\n652\n00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:25.470\nsend out communications and kind of manage\neverything all in one single location.\n\n653\n00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.690\nSo they've taken your marketing,\nyour sales,\n\n654\n00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:32.740\nyour ERP and it's all just It's all\nkind of baked into one solution.\n\n655\n00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:37.110\nThere's plenty of people out there\nthat provide services just like this.\n\n656\n00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:41.825\nAlright, that was BPASS- or AAS,\ngetting my letters all messed up,\n\n657\n00:31:41.825 --> 00:31:44.325\n>> There are a lot of A-S-Ses going on\n\n658\n00:31:44.325 --> 00:31:47.027\n>> The only other one that's on the list\n\n659\n00:31:47.027 --> 00:31:49.046\nis my favorite one, XAAS.\n\n660\n00:31:49.046 --> 00:31:53.390\nXAAS is anything as a service right?\n\n661\n00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:57.460\nThe x just means anything,\ninsert something here as a service.\n\n662\n00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.678\n>> They couldn't have made it AAAS.\n\n663\n00:31:59.678 --> 00:32:01.734\nIt's like AARP right?\n\n664\n00:32:01.734 --> 00:32:03.255\n>> It would be first in the phone book.\n\n665\n00:32:03.255 --> 00:32:04.833\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, that's a smart idea.\n\n666\n00:32:04.833 --> 00:32:06.872\nSo anyway, it's XaaS.\n\n667\n00:32:06.872 --> 00:32:11.750\nAnd basically what's happening is anything\ncan be provided as a service nowadays.\n\n668\n00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:13.660\nAnything can be put up in the cloud.\n\n669\n00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.560\nAnd so you're starting to see very\nodd things kinda jump up there.\n\n670\n00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.455\nAnd it's hard to categorize it.\n\n671\n00:32:18.455 --> 00:32:21.645\nBut it's usually organizations\nthat provide more than one thing.\n\n672\n00:32:21.645 --> 00:32:25.185\nThe best example of that would\nbe Amazon Web Service, right?\n\n673\n00:32:25.185 --> 00:32:28.355\nSo, I've got the Amazon Web Services\npage pulled up here, and\n\n674\n00:32:28.355 --> 00:32:30.455\nwhen you go into Amazon Web Services and\n\n675\n00:32:30.455 --> 00:32:34.315\ntake a look at their product list, look at\nall the different products they've got.\n\n676\n00:32:34.315 --> 00:32:39.360\nThey've got a ton of different\nproducts from databases in the Cloud,\n\n677\n00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.340\nto websites in the Cloud,\napplications, desktops.\n\n678\n00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.500\nYou got file services in the Cloud,\nmobile services, Internet of Things.\n\n679\n00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.070\nThat's something new that\nthey're starting to roll out,\n\n680\n00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.285\nall the little devices\nthat can communicate.\n\n681\n00:32:51.285 --> 00:32:55.150\nElasticsearch, which is just a search and\nindexing,\n\n682\n00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:58.060\nmachine learning, data warehousing.\n\n683\n00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:03.010\nTons of different components,\nall available via the Cloud.\n\n684\n00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:07.280\nAnd so this all gets wrapped up under this\none big umbrella term of XaaS, right?\n\n685\n00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.950\nAnything as a service.\n\n686\n00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:10.810\nAnd that's another term\nthat you may see out there.\n\n687\n00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:11.410\nAll right.\n\n688\n00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:15.270\nThose are all the terms that CompTIA\nspecifically calls out on the exam.\n\n689\n00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.080\nThere's more, right?\n\n690\n00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.540\nThere's networking as a service,\n\n691\n00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.150\nthere's others like that, but\nCompTIA doesn't call those out.\n\n692\n00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:24.410\nAnd a lot of these terms are unofficial,\nthey're not officially defined.\n\n693\n00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:27.850\nThe three big ones, as defined by NIST,\nyou need to have those memorized,\n\n694\n00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:33.800\ninfrastructure as a service, platform as\na service, and software as a service.\n\n695\n00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.270\nSo we've got to have\nthose three memorized.\n\n696\n00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:38.530\nThose are gonna be on the exam\naccording to the NIST definition.\n\n697\n00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.520\nThe other ones may turn up also.\n\n698\n00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.120\nAnd you need to be aware of those, too.\n\n699\n00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.560\nBut they're a little less common.\n\n700\n00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.510\n>> Well, awesome stuff, Don.\n\n701\n00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:47.430\nObviously, there's a lot for\nus to understand, a lot of foundational\n\n702\n00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:52.310\nknowledge, terminology that goes\nalong with cloud services per say.\n\n703\n00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.620\nSo make sure you go back through those.\n\n704\n00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:54.180\nCheck those out.\n\n705\n00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.320\nGet them burned into the brain,\n\n706\n00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.830\nbecause we're going to be talking\nabout them a lot and having that\n\n707\n00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:01.140\ngood foundational knowledge is going to\nhelp you as you move through this series.\n\n708\n00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.050\nDon, is there anything else that we\nneed to cover before we sign off today?\n\n709\n00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.290\nI think that's it for cloud models.\n\n710\n00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:08.370\nObviously we still have a lot more, and I\nknow this wasn't a very hands on episode.\n\n711\n00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.450\nIts a concept and theory type thing.\n\n712\n00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:12.070\nBut we will get to see a lot more of this.\n\n713\n00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:15.120\nWe're going to be implementing a lot of\nthese technologies as the course goes on.\n\n714\n00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.490\nBut we needed to know those.\n\n715\n00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:17.710\nThat's kinda first off.\n\n716\n00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:21.230\nWe've got more coming up though, because\nwe've gotta jump into delivery models,\n\n717\n00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.910\nwhich kinda of go hand and hand with this.\n\n718\n00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:24.390\nSo we'll get a chance to see those next,\n\n719\n00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:27.300\nbut as far as our cloud service models,\nthose are them.\n\n720\n00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.970\nThose are the ones you need to know for\nthe exam.\n\n721\n00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:30.250\n>> All right, well, thank you so much,\n\n722\n00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:32.960\nDon for joining us today and\nexplaining these topics for us.\n\n723\n00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.070\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n724\n00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.000\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n725\n00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.580\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n726\n00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.120\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n727\n00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.790\n>> And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:20.894\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are moving forward on\n\n4\n00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:23.713\nthat Cloud+ series for\nCompTIA that you love so much.\n\n5\n00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:26.210\nI know I do, it's been a good time so far.\n\n6\n00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.690\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nagain today to help lend his expertise\n\n7\n00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.050\non that very topic is our good friend and\nmentor, Mr Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.390\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.550\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.050\nAnd yup, ready to jump right\nback into the world of Cloud+.\n\n11\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.460\nIn our last episode we got a chance to\nlook at some of the difference service\n\n12\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.101\ntypes that were out there,\nand look at the cloud models.\n\n13\n00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.272\nAnd in this episode we're gonna take a\nlook at what are called the cloud delivery\n\n14\n00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:48.776\nmodels.\n\n15\n00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:52.410\nWhich sounds very, very similar but it is\nimportant to understand that there's a lot\n\n16\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.046\nof terms throughout this whole\nseries that are very similar.\n\n17\n00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:58.262\nBut we're gonna take a look at some of\nthe different delivery models that are out\n\n18\n00:00:58.262 --> 00:01:00.662\nthere, the ways that we can\nchoose to implement the cloud,\n\n19\n00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:02.062\nhow things are gonna be affected.\n\n20\n00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.700\nCuz no two cloud services are the same and\nthe way you choose to\n\n21\n00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.874\nimplement it may be very different\nfrom the way that somebody else does.\n\n22\n00:01:07.874 --> 00:01:10.436\nWe'll take a look at those,\nkinda the different pros and cons and\n\n23\n00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.591\nins and outs and\nstuff that we need to know for the exam.\n\n24\n00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:16.190\n>> Yeah, now, Don, you mentioned that\nterm there, cloud delivery models.\n\n25\n00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.340\nI'm sure that all of our viewers\nare completely up to date,\n\n26\n00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.490\nup to speed with what a delivery\nmodel is but there might be one or\n\n27\n00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.120\ntwo-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.941\n>> That aren't quite aware of what\n\n29\n00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:26.160\na delivery model is.\n\n30\n00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.360\nLet's start there,\nwhat is a cloud delivery model?\n\n31\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.752\n>> All right so, in the last episode\nwe talked about cloud models,\n\n32\n00:01:30.752 --> 00:01:32.081\nand that was platform as a service,\n\n33\n00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:35.710\ninfrastructure as a service, software\nas a service, all of that stuff, right.\n\n34\n00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.440\nBut a cloud delivery model, that's a\nlittle different because it really defines\n\n35\n00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.808\nhow or where that service\nis actually provided from.\n\n36\n00:01:44.808 --> 00:01:48.090\nWhen we talked about software\nas a service, I said that\n\n37\n00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.990\nit was a service provided by a third\nparty, hosted entirely on the cloud so\n\n38\n00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.900\nthat you didn't have to worry about\nit as the consumer, all right?\n\n39\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.450\nBut you might not be the consumer,\nyou might be the provider.\n\n40\n00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.910\nAnd if you're the provider, you\nare the one providing that web service and\n\n41\n00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.080\nmaking it available and so\n\n42\n00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.790\nyou've got to figure out the delivery\nmodel that you're gonna follow for it.\n\n43\n00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.190\nWhen we deliver a service to\nour customers, that service,\n\n44\n00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.850\nin the old days, right?\n\n45\n00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.960\nSo I think I give a story about\nthe insurance company before, right?\n\n46\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.880\nSo, in the olden days\nwe set those things up,\n\n47\n00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.950\nwe had physical service right\nthere in the building with us.\n\n48\n00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.695\nWe put the software on there,\nwe ran it, and\n\n49\n00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:29.015\nthen we exposed it to the Internet so\nthat our customers could come and\n\n50\n00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.635\ncheck on their account and\npay their bill online and all that, right?\n\n51\n00:02:31.635 --> 00:02:34.045\nWe provided that service in its entirety.\n\n52\n00:02:34.045 --> 00:02:39.555\nSo our delivery model there is what's\ncalled a private cloud, right?\n\n53\n00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:42.445\nA private cloud is a little bit different\nthan what a lot of people think of when\n\n54\n00:02:42.445 --> 00:02:44.095\nthey think of cloud services.\n\n55\n00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:45.695\nTechnically, we provided a cloud service.\n\n56\n00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:49.230\nWe didn't call it that at the time because\nten years ago it wasn't the buzz word\n\n57\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.330\nthat it is today.\n\n58\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.290\nBut our end users, our customers,\nthey would browse to our website.\n\n59\n00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.090\nThey'd log into their account,\nthey'd pay their insurance bill.\n\n60\n00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.270\nThey'd check on their premiums,\nthey'd adjust their account.\n\n61\n00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.800\nThey did all this on the website.\n\n62\n00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.200\nThey never knew what operating\nsystem we were running.\n\n63\n00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.050\nThey never knew what web\nserver we were running.\n\n64\n00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.571\nThey never knew what hardware we had or\neven where the hardware was.\n\n65\n00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:10.800\nTo them it was software as a service.\n\n66\n00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.670\nBut we chose to deliver that\nthrough private servers,\n\n67\n00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.180\nservers that we managed and\nowned ourselves.\n\n68\n00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.020\nAnd so we effectively created\nwhat's called a private cloud.\n\n69\n00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.732\nThat's one example of\na cloud delivery model.\n\n70\n00:03:21.732 --> 00:03:24.720\nAnd there's several different models for\nthat we need to be aware of for the exam.\n\n71\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.201\nBut that's what a cloud delivery model is.\n\n72\n00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:27.153\n>> Awesome.\n\n73\n00:03:27.153 --> 00:03:30.360\n>> Now, when you choose to deploy\nsomething, the cloud delivery model,\n\n74\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.940\nwell the private model that I've\ntalked about, a private cloud.\n\n75\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.600\nThat's the one that gives\nyou the most control.\n\n76\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.120\nYou control everything.\n\n77\n00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.340\nBut you lose a lot of the benefits.\n\n78\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.320\nActually, you lose all of the benefits,\nreally, of going to a true cloud model.\n\n79\n00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.694\nWith a true cloud model, that's where\nsomebody else is hosting this stuff.\n\n80\n00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:49.052\nIt's out of there and\nyou get a lot of benefits there.\n\n81\n00:03:49.052 --> 00:03:53.320\nBut when you do a private cloud, you buy\nyour own server infrastructure, right?\n\n82\n00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.750\nAnd in the last show I\nbrought up this one diagram.\n\n83\n00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.330\nLet me bring that same diagram\nback up here, this diagram.\n\n84\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.850\nWhen you bring up a private cloud,\nyou buy your own physical servers.\n\n85\n00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.225\nSo, if I need ten servers I\nbuy ten servers, I pay for\n\n86\n00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.420\n100% of those servers on day one.\n\n87\n00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.190\nRight, you go to Dell, you got to HP,\nwhatever, you order ten servers,\n\n88\n00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.330\nyou cut them a PO, and then you cut\nthem a check to pay for those servers.\n\n89\n00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.100\nSo you own those servers\nin their entirety.\n\n90\n00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.430\nIf you use those servers or if you don't\nuse those servers, you've already paid for\n\n91\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.232\nthem, right, the money's already gone.\n\n92\n00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:29.010\nWith a cloud service, like Amazon Web\nServices, I can provision servers right\n\n93\n00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.820\nnow and then if I don't need them a month\nfrom now, I can just shut them down.\n\n94\n00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.120\nI pay for them when I use them, I don't\npay for them when I'm not using them.\n\n95\n00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.480\nThat's one of the big\nbenefits of a cloud service.\n\n96\n00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.450\nAnd I can do it rapidly.\n\n97\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.290\nIf I need a new server I\ncan just go to Amazon and\n\n98\n00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.398\nprovision up an instance\nthat'll be up in five minutes.\n\n99\n00:04:44.398 --> 00:04:48.020\nOr I can go to HP and\n\n100\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.380\nget a quote, take it to accounting and\nget a PO, send the PO to HP.\n\n101\n00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.050\nTwo weeks later,\n\n102\n00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.250\nreceive a server, hand the invoice over to\naccounting, have accounting pay the check.\n\n103\n00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.910\nTakes two weeks to get it and\nthen I gotta install OSs and\n\n104\n00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.560\nall the other stuff that has to be done.\n\n105\n00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.770\nThere's a big time differential there,\nright?\n\n106\n00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.650\nBut it's not all doom and gloom.\n\n107\n00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.110\nThe private service isn't all bad, right?\n\n108\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.330\nOn the private side, if we have a private\ncloud, we have complete control\n\n109\n00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.890\nover everything, the hardware,\nthe software, the operating system.\n\n110\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.660\nWe can choose how it's configured,\nwe can monitor it, we can maintain it.\n\n111\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.260\nIt's all up to us to do that.\n\n112\n00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.650\nAnd if we've got the staff and\nthe talent to do it then, by all means,\n\n113\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.630\nyou can have a private cloud and\nyou'll be in business, right.\n\n114\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.170\nThat's one of the things that companies\nhave been doing for 30 years now.\n\n115\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.575\nBut, if you're a small business,\nmedium business,\n\n116\n00:05:33.575 --> 00:05:35.362\nyou don't have the resources available.\n\n117\n00:05:35.362 --> 00:05:38.362\nOr you're a large business and\nyou just wanna be more efficient with your\n\n118\n00:05:38.362 --> 00:05:41.380\nresources, you can outsource\nthis to somebody else, right.\n\n119\n00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.230\nAnd when you outsource it,\n\n120\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.700\nand you run it on Amazon's cloud,\nor Microsoft's Azure, or\n\n121\n00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.020\nRackspace, or somebody like that, you're\nnow using what's called a public cloud.\n\n122\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.140\nPrivate cloud,\nthat's servers that you own.\n\n123\n00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.780\nA public cloud, those are servers\nthat somebody else owns and\n\n124\n00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.870\nyou're just renting access from them,\nright?\n\n125\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.760\nThat renting access aspect,\nthat's kind of important, right?\n\n126\n00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.920\nSomebody else is providing that access and\nyou just rent it.\n\n127\n00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.820\nWhen you're done with it,\nyou turn it back in, right.\n\n128\n00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.200\nSo those are the two most common models.\n\n129\n00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.560\nI'm gonna talk a few\nmore a little bit later.\n\n130\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.220\nBut the public cloud and\nthe private cloud,\n\n131\n00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.420\nthose are the two most common\ncloud delivery models.\n\n132\n00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.680\nNow whichever model we choose,\n\n133\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.860\nthere's a couple of considerations\nwe need to be aware of, right?\n\n134\n00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.710\nAnd let me just address some\nof these right off the bat cuz\n\n135\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.720\nthey are pretty important.\n\n136\n00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.620\nSecurity is a big thing, right?\n\n137\n00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.220\nHow do I know if I should do\nprivate cloud or public cloud?\n\n138\n00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.420\nWell, I need to understand\nmy security needs.\n\n139\n00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.765\nIf I do a public cloud, if I go to\nAmazon or Microsoft or Google Compute,\n\n140\n00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:43.380\nRackspace, one of those guys, when you\ndo that there's gonna be multi tendency.\n\n141\n00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.190\nI know I've mentioned this concept\nbefore where you're running on hardware\n\n142\n00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.419\nright along side of the customers.\n\n143\n00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.750\nI might not want that, right?\n\n144\n00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.440\nI might be handling sensitive data,\nmedical data, financial data.\n\n145\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.610\nIn which case, I want that nice and\nisolated, nice and separate.\n\n146\n00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.170\nI can guarantee that with my own\nequipment in a private cloud.\n\n147\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.760\nI can't guarantee that on somebody else's\nequipment in a public cloud, right.\n\n148\n00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.420\nAnd I might not even be\nlegally allowed to do it.\n\n149\n00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.770\nThere's plenty of regulations out\nthere like HIPAA and Sarbanes–Oxley.\n\n150\n00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.850\nThose are both here in the US,\nbut even internationally there's\n\n151\n00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.270\nrules that dictate how you're\nable to handle that data.\n\n152\n00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.760\nI might not be allowed to\nput it up in a public cloud.\n\n153\n00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.500\nKey thing to remember for the exam,\njust because it's called a public cloud\n\n154\n00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.200\ndoesn't mean that your servers\nare available to everybody.\n\n155\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.960\nYou can have servers in Amazon Web\nServices that are partitioned off and\n\n156\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.640\nisolated just for you to access,\nnot the rest of the world.\n\n157\n00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.470\nYou can do that, right?\n\n158\n00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.840\nWe'll see examples of that\nlater on in the series.\n\n159\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.480\nBut it's called a public cloud\nbecause anybody can be a customer.\n\n160\n00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.570\nAnybody can go and\nspin up instances in that cloud.\n\n161\n00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.963\nThey pay for it, not you, but they can\nbe running right alongside of you.\n\n162\n00:07:48.963 --> 00:07:53.813\nSo security is a big deal,\nmulti tendency, regulations,\n\n163\n00:07:53.813 --> 00:07:58.181\ndata segregation, all of that,\nand data disposal.\n\n164\n00:07:58.181 --> 00:08:00.527\nSo maybe I bring up an instance.\n\n165\n00:08:00.527 --> 00:08:04.100\nI'm working with my data on it and\nthen I'm done with it.\n\n166\n00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.580\nAnd so I delete the instance.\n\n167\n00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.400\nWell, my data was stored on a hard\ndrive somewhere at that cloud provider.\n\n168\n00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.040\nWhat happens to that hard drive?\n\n169\n00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.870\nThey provision it out to somebody else,\nright.\n\n170\n00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.190\nI'm done with it, so\nnow another customer can have it.\n\n171\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.390\nWhat if that customer installs\nforensic software and\n\n172\n00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.270\nstarts scanning the hard drive?\n\n173\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.680\nCould they find my data?\n\n174\n00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.030\nThey could, so I need to make sure\nthe cloud provider protects from that too,\n\n175\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.280\nwhich most of them do.\n\n176\n00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.900\nBut if you wanna be sure you do your own\nhardware, you go private cloud, right.\n\n177\n00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.320\nSo private clouds are when\nwe want to be sure,\n\n178\n00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.500\nwhen we want full control of everything.\n\n179\n00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.120\nA public cloud is we wanna be really\nefficient, we wanna get the best bang for\n\n180\n00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.599\nour buck and\nwe let somebody else manage it for us.\n\n181\n00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.590\nAll right, other things, functionality.\n\n182\n00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.110\nOn a private cloud,\nyou manage the whole thing.\n\n183\n00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.610\nSo if there's some new feature or\nfunction you wanna implement,\n\n184\n00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.320\nyou just implement it.\n\n185\n00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.570\nYou do it, right.\n\n186\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.910\nYou've got a gigabit of\ninternet bandwidth and\n\n187\n00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.470\nyou decide you wanna go up to 10 gigabit.\n\n188\n00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:54.370\nGreat.\nYou do it.\n\n189\n00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.450\nYou just go and get 10 gig and go broke.\n\n190\n00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.230\nIt's really expensive.\n\n191\n00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.110\nBut you can do it, and off you go.\n\n192\n00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.510\nYou want switches of a certain brand.\n\n193\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.330\nGreat you do it.\n\n194\n00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.390\nYou get those brands and you put them in.\n\n195\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.500\nWhen you go with a public cloud,\na third party.\n\n196\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.210\nAll that stuff is hidden from you.\n\n197\n00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.710\nThe, the type of switches they have.\n\n198\n00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:12.520\nThe routers they have.\n\n199\n00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.470\nAnd all that.\nAll that's hidden from you.\n\n200\n00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.440\nYou don't see it.\n\n201\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.050\nAnd you don't have any control over it so,\n\n202\n00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.250\nthe functionality is limited to\nwhatever that provider advertises.\n\n203\n00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.370\nSo, when they advertise\npublic cloud service to you,\n\n204\n00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.830\nthey list all the features and\nthat's it, and unless,\n\n205\n00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.200\nthey have a change of heart later on,\nthose are the features you get.\n\n206\n00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.860\nSo, if you need additional\nfunctionality or\n\n207\n00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.310\nyou wanna change functionality,\nyou're better off with a private cloud.\n\n208\n00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.250\nAll right.\n\n209\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.250\nThe last thing I wanna mention on all\nthese, when you go to select a model\n\n210\n00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:41.430\nis you've always gotta worry about\nperformance validation, right.\n\n211\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.060\nWhen you have a private cloud, when you\nhave your own service that you manage,\n\n212\n00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.660\nyou have exclusive\naccess to those servers.\n\n213\n00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.450\nIt's just you.\n\n214\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:48.957\nJust you.\nSo\n\n215\n00:09:48.957 --> 00:09:52.070\nyou have access to 100% of\nthe resources on that server.\n\n216\n00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.240\nIf it has a quad core\ntwo gigahertz CPU in it,\n\n217\n00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.670\nyou have access to all four cores,\ntwo gigahertz CPU.\n\n218\n00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.090\nYou have access to 100% of the resource.\n\n219\n00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.100\nBut when you're up in a cloud service,\nit's not like that.\n\n220\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.670\nIt's a shared resource.\n\n221\n00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.540\nSo you may or may not have access\nto all of that at any given time.\n\n222\n00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.440\nAnd a lot of the providers will\noffer to do things that can reserve\n\n223\n00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.960\nresources available to you, or guarantee\ncertain resource levels to you, and so\n\n224\n00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.230\nyou've gotta take those steps, but\nyou also need to validate that you\n\n225\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.150\nare actually getting that when\nthey give you a guarantee.\n\n226\n00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.250\nSo for example,\nlet me give you guys some examples here.\n\n227\n00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.440\nMicrosoft.\n\n228\n00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.190\nSo if you deploy something in\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud, right,\n\n229\n00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.800\nso I deploy a virtual machine up in Azure.\n\n230\n00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.590\nWell, they actually, it's in\nthe fine print when you sign up but\n\n231\n00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.760\nthis is a little TechNet\narticle where they go into it.\n\n232\n00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.137\nAnd somewhere in here, right here.\n\n233\n00:10:44.137 --> 00:10:48.658\nSo they tell us that when we\ndeploy a virtual machine,\n\n234\n00:10:48.658 --> 00:10:52.679\naccording to Microsoft's recommendations,\n\n235\n00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:58.014\nthat they'll guarantee us\na 99.95% Azure SLA, right.\n\n236\n00:10:58.014 --> 00:11:02.000\nAnd they're actually telling us right here\nthat by default, you don't get an SLA.\n\n237\n00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.240\nThey don't guarantee you\nanyup time by default.\n\n238\n00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.110\nUnless you configure your virtual machines\naccording to this document right here,\n\n239\n00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.810\nthat's why I've got this document\nbookmarked, cuz I use it all the time,\n\n240\n00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.650\nthat you have to configure what's\ncalled an Availability Group.\n\n241\n00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.220\nWhen you start spinning up\nvirtual machines in Azure,\n\n242\n00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.830\nthey're not in\nan Availability Group by default,\n\n243\n00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.300\nin which case they don't,\nthe SLA doesn't apply to them.\n\n244\n00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.090\nThey can go down and\nMicrosoft says, oops, sorry, right.\n\n245\n00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.410\nBut if you configure them\nproperly they'll give you 99.95%.\n\n246\n00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:32.050\nThat means they guarantee that 99.95%\nof the time your virtual machine\n\n247\n00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.210\nwill be on and functional.\n\n248\n00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.230\nWell if you work the math out on that,\nright, 99.95% uptime,\n\n249\n00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.830\nit ends up being, I think I made a note\nof it here, yep, 22 minutes per month.\n\n250\n00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:47.240\nWe can be down for 22 minutes per month,\nor right around there, right.\n\n251\n00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.330\nWell, is that good or bad?\n\n252\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.790\nIt's sort of good.\n\n253\n00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.670\nIf you reboot a server a couple of times\nyou can eat up 22 minutes pretty fast, but\n\n254\n00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.620\nto have an actual outage limited\ndown to 22 minutes is not so bad.\n\n255\n00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.460\nIf you add it up over the months\nthough throughout oa year it\n\n256\n00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.240\nends up being a couple of hours.\n\n257\n00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.700\nAnd i think it's like four hours or\n\n258\n00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.530\nsomething like that and,\ncan you afford four hours of down time?\n\n259\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.820\nMaybe.\nBut this might not be that good either.\n\n260\n00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.600\nYou might be able to get a higher level of\navailability on your own equipment if you\n\n261\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.890\nmanage it.\n\n262\n00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.960\nBut there's ways that we can\ndeploy things in the cloud,\n\n263\n00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.160\nwe'll see later in the series,\nthat can get us to 100% availability.\n\n264\n00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.350\nI know that's always a risky thing to say.\n\n265\n00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.710\nLike 100%, you're crazy.\n\n266\n00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.500\nBut to get higher levels of\navailabilities is actually not that hard.\n\n267\n00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.840\nSo this is just saying that\nthat one VM would have 99.95%.\n\n268\n00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.910\nI might have three or four virtual\nmachines behind a load balancer, so\n\n269\n00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.330\nif one of them goes down for\n22 minutes I'm okay,\n\n270\n00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.150\ncuz the other virtual\nmachines are still up.\n\n271\n00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.390\nWe can plan for that,\nwe can still have that availability.\n\n272\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.760\nBut you've gotta be aware of that for\ntwo reasons.\n\n273\n00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.979\nOne to know what your possible\ndowntime could be, right.\n\n274\n00:12:47.979 --> 00:12:51.370\nAnd then two, to verify that\nyou are actually getting that.\n\n275\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.930\nHow do I know my machines\nare actually up 99.95% of the time.\n\n276\n00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.560\nMaybe Microsoft violated the SLA,\nand if that's the case,\n\n277\n00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.610\nI need at least a service credit or\nsomething else.\n\n278\n00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.480\nSo we need to track this stuff.\n\n279\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.290\nAnd that's very easy to track on your own\nsystems but when you go up into a cloud\n\n280\n00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.060\nservice you need to put something\nin place to track them.\n\n281\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.790\n>> Now Don, we've talked about public and\n\n282\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.010\nwe've talked about private\ncloud models here.\n\n283\n00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.110\nNow what if I want,\n\n284\n00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.890\ncuz they both seem to have their own\nbenefits and there's pros and cons, right?\n\n285\n00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.570\nEverything has its pros and cons.\n\n286\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.820\nSometimes I might want to throw\nstuff in a public cloud and\n\n287\n00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:25.420\nother times maybe I want the security and\nthe comfort of a private cloud,\n\n288\n00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.170\nis there a time when I can take\nthe lovely hunk of chocolate and\n\n289\n00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.400\nslam some peanut butter in it and\nmake a lovely peanut butter cup?\n\n290\n00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.070\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n291\n00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.610\nAnd that's what a lot of companies do.\n\n292\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.775\nYou end up with what's\ncalled a hybrid cloud.\n\n293\n00:13:35.775 --> 00:13:38.375\nAnd a hybrid, we really have\na mix of public and private.\n\n294\n00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:41.980\nSo, most organizations these days,\nif you're,\n\n295\n00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:47.460\nunless you're a startup just opening now,\nmost people have on premises servers.\n\n296\n00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.500\nAnd on premises, that means those\nservers are right here with you,\n\n297\n00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.910\nthey're in the building with you.\n\n298\n00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.230\nAnd so like here, at the ITProTV studios,\nwe actually don't have any,\n\n299\n00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.650\nwell I shouldn't say any,\n\n300\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.570\nwe have like two servers here that\nare just used as test servers on the show.\n\n301\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.650\nYou know, the things that we use for\nlabs and stuff.\n\n302\n00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.300\nBut if you're watching\nthis episode right now,\n\n303\n00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.060\nyou're not watching it from\na server here in this building.\n\n304\n00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.600\nThis building, we could cut the power\nto it, turn everything off.\n\n305\n00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.530\nAnd, you'd, well,\nyou'd be watching reruns, I guess.\n\n306\n00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:13.380\nBut, you know, otherwise,\n\n307\n00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.420\nthere's no server infrastructure\nhere in the building with us.\n\n308\n00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.112\nGot lots of switches, and routers,\nfirewalls, that kind of stuff.\n\n309\n00:14:18.112 --> 00:14:22.260\nBut no servers right,\neverything we have is in the cloud, right.\n\n310\n00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.590\nIt's all up there floating\naround in the internet,\n\n311\n00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.840\nmost of it's in Amazon Web Services but\na couple are in other services.\n\n312\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.480\nIt's all just out there in the cloud.\n\n313\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.950\nBut the traditional model\nis to have the servers\n\n314\n00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.260\nright here in the building with you,\non premises.\n\n315\n00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.780\nThen you get great security cuz you manage\nthose system, you control that access.\n\n316\n00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.210\nYou get great functionality and\ncontrol there,\n\n317\n00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.880\nyou have total control of those systems.\n\n318\n00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.590\nAnd you get great performance.\n\n319\n00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.460\nBecause if my desktop is accessing\na database on a server that's just on\n\n320\n00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.810\nthe other side of the building, I can\nget a gig connection to it, no big deal.\n\n321\n00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.570\nBut my internet connection here at\nthe studio is only 80 megabyte.\n\n322\n00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.390\nSo if I'm connecting to a database out\nthere on the internet 80 megabyte's\n\n323\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.650\nthe best I'm gonna get.\n\n324\n00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.950\nI'd get better performance here locally.\n\n325\n00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.310\nWhen you go to the cloud, though, you get\nthe benefit of somebody else managing\n\n326\n00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:09.520\nthe systems, and world wide availability,\nand instant scale\n\n327\n00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.680\nup where I can add new hardware or instant\nscale out, or I can add more instances.\n\n328\n00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.900\nThose kind of things are the great\nadvantages going to the cloud.\n\n329\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.560\nSo if I'm a new company\nlike an internet start up,\n\n330\n00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.690\nyou put everything up in the cloud.\n\n331\n00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:21.540\nThat's the best way to do it.\n\n332\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.030\nBut if you're an old company going the old\nmodel, you can dip your toe in and\n\n333\n00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:31.890\nstart to kind of expand out and have some\nsystems local and some in the cloud.\n\n334\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.230\nYou can mix and\nthat's a hybrid environment.\n\n335\n00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.400\nSo your on premise equipment that's\npart of your private cloud, and\n\n336\n00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.620\nthen your instances hosted out there\nin the internet, in the cloud,\n\n337\n00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:46.390\nthose become your your cloud environment,\nright, and so your public cloud.\n\n338\n00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.017\nSo you've got your private cloud and\n\n339\n00:15:48.017 --> 00:15:50.544\nyour public cloud combined\nto create that hybrid cloud.\n\n340\n00:15:50.544 --> 00:15:52.332\nAnd there's a few different\nways to go about it.\n\n341\n00:15:52.332 --> 00:15:56.349\nWe'll see, actually, is it in this\nshow that we're gonna talk about it?\n\n342\n00:15:56.349 --> 00:15:58.207\nNow, it's in another show\nthat we'll address it.\n\n343\n00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:02.521\nThere's some technologies like cloud\nbursting, where maybe your primary service\n\n344\n00:16:02.521 --> 00:16:06.420\nis provided out of your local center but\nthen you can burst up into the cloud.\n\n345\n00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.720\nAnd so\ndifferent things like that can apply.\n\n346\n00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.110\nBut, the key thing to remember\nis that you can mix and match.\n\n347\n00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.400\nAnd there's one more special type I wanna\naddress that may turn up on the exam.\n\n348\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.670\nAnd that's called a community cloud,\nright.\n\n349\n00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.060\nPublic cloud, private cloud,\nthose are your servers, you manage them.\n\n350\n00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.720\nOn a private cloud,\nyou own all the hardware, that's yours.\n\n351\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.510\nOn a public cloud, you don't own any of\nthe hardware, the service provider does.\n\n352\n00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:34.480\nAWS or Azure or whoever it is,\nthey own all the infrastructure, not you.\n\n353\n00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.860\nIn a hybrid, it's a mixture of those two.\n\n354\n00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.760\nBut a community cloud,\nis where you share resources amongst\n\n355\n00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.620\nother organizations that are a part of\nsome kind of community with you, right?\n\n356\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:49.470\nSo, for example, maybe I'm in\na building like this building,\n\n357\n00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.230\nwe actually share this building\nwith another IT company.\n\n358\n00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.920\nAnd we have an Internet\nconnection that we both share.\n\n359\n00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.410\nIt's a shared resource, right?\n\n360\n00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.180\nSo it's like a community cloud,\nthat we both share this connection.\n\n361\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.945\nBecause we're two similar companies part\nof the same organization and off we go,\n\n362\n00:17:03.945 --> 00:17:04.930\nright.\n\n363\n00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.120\nWell, one of the best examples of that,\n\n364\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.820\nlet me see if I have\ntheir web page pulled up.\n\n365\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.020\nYeah, this guy right here.\n\n366\n00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:15.430\nSo, this is Amazon Web Services,\nthe AWS GovCloud (US), right.\n\n367\n00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:20.550\nAmazon set up a special cloud,\nan entirely separate data center,\n\n368\n00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.550\nseparate hardware and infrastructure,\n\n369\n00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:27.750\nthat can only be used by US government\nagencies and approved contractors.\n\n370\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.690\nAnd so\nthey actually say that in here somewhere.\n\n371\n00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:34.250\nIt's somewhere in here,\nthey list, here it is.\n\n372\n00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:38.089\nIt's available to US government agencies,\ngovernment contractors, private and\n\n373\n00:17:38.089 --> 00:17:41.712\npublic commercial entities, and\neducation institutions, non-profits and\n\n374\n00:17:41.712 --> 00:17:45.325\nresearch organizations that meet\nGovCloud (US) requirements for access.\n\n375\n00:17:45.325 --> 00:17:48.125\nSo, it says private and\npublic commercial entities.\n\n376\n00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:50.425\nWell, ITProTV,\nwe're a commercial entity, right?\n\n377\n00:17:50.425 --> 00:17:51.795\nSo we can use it?\n\n378\n00:17:51.795 --> 00:17:54.675\nNah, it's that last little part there, you\ngotta meet the government requirements.\n\n379\n00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:58.310\nThat means you have to be\neither a contractor or\n\n380\n00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.090\na part of a government organization\nin order to use this cloud.\n\n381\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:06.100\nSo now you've got pooled resources\nthat are a little more trustworthy.\n\n382\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.210\nRemember multi tenancy?\n\n383\n00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.080\nWhere I said, I could have a virtual\nmachine running in the cloud,\n\n384\n00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.170\nrunning right alongside\none of my competitors, or\n\n385\n00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.190\nrunning right alongside some\nnefarious organization.\n\n386\n00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.060\nAnd I wouldn't know it,\ncuz they're running side by side.\n\n387\n00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.850\nAnd there's risk that I'm exposed to.\n\n388\n00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:19.960\nWell, if you're in the GovCloud,\n\n389\n00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.160\nyou're running side by side\nwith other government agencies.\n\n390\n00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.050\nSo you know that while there\nis multi tenancy going on,\n\n391\n00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.480\nthey're other people that have to live up\nto the same security restrictions as you.\n\n392\n00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.440\nSo this is a great way of kind of\nmitigating some of the risk we\n\n393\n00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.830\nhave with going to a public cloud\nenvironment, but it's not truly public.\n\n394\n00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.060\nNot anybody can be a part of it,\nit's restricted.\n\n395\n00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.140\nSo, this is just Amazon's GovCloud,\nthat's one example of a community cloud.\n\n396\n00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.590\nThere's plenty of others that are out\nthere, depending on your organization,\n\n397\n00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.620\nyour structure, and\nyour company alliances that you have.\n\n398\n00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.500\n>> Now Don, whether we're using\na public cloud, a private cloud, or\n\n399\n00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.950\na combination of the both,\nsome sort of hybrid cloud,\n\n400\n00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.320\nwe have to be able to control what\nis going on inside of these systems.\n\n401\n00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.300\nThat's kinda our thing,\nit's what we do, we're IT people.\n\n402\n00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.840\nI need to be able to say this\nsystem is going to do this.\n\n403\n00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.740\nOr maybe even automate some types\nof things that it's going to do for\n\n404\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.990\nme when certain events occurs.\n\n405\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:16.390\nNow when you bring in the cloud,\nthis opens up a whole new world really for\n\n406\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.940\nus IT people to have to deal with and\nmake sure that these things can happen.\n\n407\n00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.150\nAnd we call that orchestration, right?\n\n408\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.300\n>> Yeah, things get really complex, right?\n\n409\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.950\nWhen you're deploying a private cloud,\nand you control everything,\n\n410\n00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:32.585\nthen you could choose to\nhave one vendor's hardware,\n\n411\n00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:36.375\none virtualization software package,\none operating system.\n\n412\n00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:39.365\nSo you got a common platform across\nall of your environment, and\n\n413\n00:19:39.365 --> 00:19:41.955\nthen you deploy your applications on top\nof that, it can be very straight forward.\n\n414\n00:19:41.955 --> 00:19:45.325\nBut when you start doing a hybrid cloud or\ndeploying out on the Internet with\n\n415\n00:19:45.325 --> 00:19:48.965\ndifferent cloud services,\nthings really start to get challenging.\n\n416\n00:19:48.965 --> 00:19:52.755\nI might have VMware servers like ESX.\n\n417\n00:19:52.755 --> 00:19:55.190\nI might have Microsoft\nservers with Hyper-V.\n\n418\n00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:59.010\nI might have Zen or\nKVM virtualization platforms.\n\n419\n00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.930\nI might have applications that are made\nup of more than one component.\n\n420\n00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:06.780\nThey might have web server, a load\nbalancer, a firewall, a database, right?\n\n421\n00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.610\nAll of these are different components\nthat make up this one application.\n\n422\n00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.410\nAnd when I want to deploy or manage it,\nthat starts to get really challenging.\n\n423\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:17.810\nSo, when we start dealing with hybrid\nclouds especially, but even in the other\n\n424\n00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:22.680\ncloud models, you're typically going to\nwant some kind of orchestration, right.\n\n425\n00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.710\nNow, be aware there's some terminology\nthat can get confused here,\n\n426\n00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:26.850\neven on the exam.\n\n427\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.840\nAutomation versus orchestration, right.\n\n428\n00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.220\nAutomation is where we take one particular\ntask, and we automate it, right?\n\n429\n00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.400\nHey, I want to deploy a web server.\n\n430\n00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.360\nSo I have this image of the web server,\nand I want to bring it up on Hyper-V.\n\n431\n00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.400\nSo I create some automation task that will\nbasically deploy web servers to Hyper-V.\n\n432\n00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.725\nBut orchestration, orchestration is where\nI tie more than one thing together.\n\n433\n00:20:48.725 --> 00:20:51.390\nAnd I say all right,\nI'm monitoring this entire activity and\n\n434\n00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:53.810\nif the web servers get busy I\ncan deploy new web servers, but\n\n435\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.900\nI can also deploy replica\ndatabases to bring those up.\n\n436\n00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.410\nAnd if there's a fault on one that\nit can take it out and redeploy it.\n\n437\n00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.294\nAnd if there's an update to my software,\n\n438\n00:21:01.294 --> 00:21:03.850\nthey can push that out\nto all the nodes too.\n\n439\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.520\nIt is automation, but\nyou're automating more than one thing, and\n\n440\n00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.240\nthat's what creates orchestration.\n\n441\n00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.150\nSo orchestration is a much\nbigger kind of concept,\n\n442\n00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.840\na bigger deal than just automation.\n\n443\n00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.460\nAnd orchestration is a key component and\nyou'll see it everywhere.\n\n444\n00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.090\nI know we talk about it more in other\nshows but to give you guys some examples,\n\n445\n00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.820\nlet me show you,\nwe'll do Amazon Web Services.\n\n446\n00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.501\nSo, here in Amazon Web Services,\nif you look at all their features,\n\n447\n00:21:27.501 --> 00:21:28.585\nthey've got EC2.\n\n448\n00:21:28.585 --> 00:21:30.535\nSo that's where I could\ndeploy virtual servers.\n\n449\n00:21:30.535 --> 00:21:33.272\nSo I wanna bring up a virtual\nserver in the cloud, I go into EC2,\n\n450\n00:21:33.272 --> 00:21:34.860\nI create a new instance.\n\n451\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.720\nOr if I just want storage, I can go to S3,\nright, their simple storage solution, and\n\n452\n00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.691\nI can start to deploy that\nright there in the cloud.\n\n453\n00:21:41.691 --> 00:21:46.020\nOr if I want a database, somewhere in here\nwe'll see RDS, a relational database.\n\n454\n00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.190\nI can whip up a database server and\n\n455\n00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.160\nhave it up there in the cloud,\nall managed by them.\n\n456\n00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:55.660\nBut if I'm gonna deploy a server\nthat needs a load balanced web farm,\n\n457\n00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.710\nthat's EC2, that has the webpage\nstored in S3 for storage,\n\n458\n00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.880\nand then has a back end\ndatabase stored in our RDS.\n\n459\n00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.360\nHow do I deploy that all at once?\n\n460\n00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.950\nIt's kinda hard to automate that,\nit's across more than one service.\n\n461\n00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:11.410\nAnd that's where we have\nthings like OpsWorks.\n\n462\n00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:15.090\nOpsWorks is Amazon's automation and\norchestration that you can do.\n\n463\n00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:18.550\nYou can jump in there and create these\npackages that let you deploy an entire\n\n464\n00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.250\nservice very quickly and very easily.\n\n465\n00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.250\nThe dev team comes to you one day and\nsays, hey Don,\n\n466\n00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.000\nI really wanna test out\nthis idea on our website.\n\n467\n00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.200\nBut I don't wanna do it on our actual\nwebsite cuz I'll probably break it.\n\n468\n00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.440\nSo can you give me a test\nenvironment real quick and\n\n469\n00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.470\njust clone the production environment.\n\n470\n00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.390\nI need the exact same thing as\nthe production environment to test on.\n\n471\n00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.460\nWell, in the old days I would start\npulling out my hair like I'm gonna have to\n\n472\n00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.030\nbuy some servers, I'm gonna have to\ntake a backup here and restore it here.\n\n473\n00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.820\nIt could take me days or weeks even to\nget a good test environment built up\n\n474\n00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.550\nthat properly replicated\nthe production environment.\n\n475\n00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:54.540\nBut if I have OpsWorks going,\nI can say take the deployment file from my\n\n476\n00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.070\nproduction app and\njust redeploy it over here as a test app.\n\n477\n00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.600\nAnd then it's done.\n\n478\n00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.181\nAnd I've got databases and web front ends\nand everything just like production, but\n\n479\n00:23:02.181 --> 00:23:03.300\nsomewhere else, right?\n\n480\n00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.760\nThat's what OpsWork does.\n\n481\n00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.000\nIt's really impressive stuff.\n\n482\n00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.710\nAmazon's OpsWorks is actually built\non top of a technology called Chef.\n\n483\n00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:15.640\nAnd there's several different applications\nout there like Puppet, Chef is a big one.\n\n484\n00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.820\nThey can do this where you create this\ntemplate files that then allow you to\n\n485\n00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:24.810\nquickly deploy this stuff out and create\nas much of an infrastructure as you need.\n\n486\n00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.080\nIt's really impressive stuff.\n\n487\n00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.310\nIf you're doing a hybrid cloud where\nyou're mixing and matching these\n\n488\n00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.000\nenvironments, you're gonna need something\nlike orchestration to manage it.\n\n489\n00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.030\nNow, the challenge with applications\nlike these, like Chef and\n\n490\n00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.470\nPuppet, is that, boy, they're hard.\n\n491\n00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:43.315\nIt's really challenging to get all\nthe configuration files written, and\n\n492\n00:23:43.315 --> 00:23:47.719\nthe automation, and planning for all the\npossible outcomes of an activity, right?\n\n493\n00:23:47.719 --> 00:23:51.739\nCuz if I say spin up a web server but\nfor some reason the web server fails,\n\n494\n00:23:51.739 --> 00:23:52.484\nwhat do I do?\n\n495\n00:23:52.484 --> 00:23:55.158\nWell, the whole script could just die and\nthe thing ends, or\n\n496\n00:23:55.158 --> 00:23:58.313\nit can recover from that and try and\nspin up an instance somewhere else.\n\n497\n00:23:58.313 --> 00:24:01.772\nRight, so you can have all of\nthese contingencies planned.\n\n498\n00:24:01.772 --> 00:24:04.854\nThere's plenty of third parties out there\nthat make software that already does\n\n499\n00:24:04.854 --> 00:24:05.410\nthat for you.\n\n500\n00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.620\nWhere they've already done the legwork\nof creating all of these scripts.\n\n501\n00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:13.790\nAn example would be\nVMware's vCenter servers.\n\n502\n00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:17.292\nAnd it's a central management platform for\nmanaging your cloud deployment.\n\n503\n00:24:17.292 --> 00:24:19.949\nAnd it will manage your system,\nyour environment.\n\n504\n00:24:19.949 --> 00:24:23.819\nIt will ensure that if you need to\ndeploy machines that it will do it and\n\n505\n00:24:23.819 --> 00:24:27.970\nif something fails it'll allow you\nto be alerted so you can redo it.\n\n506\n00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:32.760\nIt can monitor performance and take\nactions based on performance and so on.\n\n507\n00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.740\nvCenter is really great for managing\nvSphere, for VMware, vSphere, and ESX.\n\n508\n00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.650\nBut if you got a cloud deployment\nin Amazon Web Services,\n\n509\n00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.290\nvCenter doesn't help you so\nmuch anymore right?\n\n510\n00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.450\nSo it's really designed kind of for\ntheir products.\n\n511\n00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:50.753\nThere's other products that are out\nthere like Microsoft System Center 2012.\n\n512\n00:24:50.753 --> 00:24:56.254\nAnd with System Center 2012, what it does\nis it allows you to manage, let me go\n\n513\n00:24:56.254 --> 00:25:03.020\ninto the components here, to manage hybrid\nor mixed not homogeneous, heterogenous?\n\n514\n00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.991\nWhatever.\nMixed environment.\n\n515\n00:25:04.991 --> 00:25:07.440\nI'm losing my vocabulary, I guess.\n\n516\n00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.470\nBut they have a product called the System\nCenter Virtual Machine Manager, and\n\n517\n00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.930\nit lets you manage not only\nMicrosoft HyperV servers but\n\n518\n00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:19.510\nalso VMware servers, and\nCitrix XenServer also.\n\n519\n00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.040\nSo if I have virtual machines and\n\n520\n00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.390\nI wanna deploy them, I can spread\nthem across multiple platforms.\n\n521\n00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.050\nNow having a hybrid cloud\nis not such of a big deal.\n\n522\n00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.170\nAnd this is fully integrated with Azure so\nI can have\n\n523\n00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:34.550\non premises servers in my private cloud\nand I can be deploying servers into my\n\n524\n00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:38.480\npublic cloud in Azure all at the same\ntime all managed from one place.\n\n525\n00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.370\nAnd the orchestration automation\ncan happen right here inside of it.\n\n526\n00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.830\nSee we've got the orchestrator\nproduct right beneath it.\n\n527\n00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.350\nThat's a part of System Center.\n\n528\n00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:50.270\nYou can create workflows for performing\nprocesses or run books for deploying\n\n529\n00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.610\nvirtual machines that are preconfigured\nthat already do what your need.\n\n530\n00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.150\nIt's all right in there.\n\n531\n00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:56.960\nIt's really powerful stuff.\n\n532\n00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.370\nIf you want to learn more about\norchestration, I know we did a Azure VM\n\n533\n00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.730\nshow where we kinda demonstrated\na little bit of orchestration in there.\n\n534\n00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.620\nAnd a little bit in the VMware it shows.\n\n535\n00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.850\nSo you can jump over some of\nour other shows and see that.\n\n536\n00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:12.940\nCompTIA wants you to be familiar with the\nconcept and what this kind of entails and\n\n537\n00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.400\nit's just automating really\ncomplex deployments.\n\n538\n00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.810\nNow, if you were me and you had to\ndeal with this, I hate having to write\n\n539\n00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:25.190\na bunch of automation scripts and\nsetting up orchestration.\n\n540\n00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.830\nSo there are other players\nin the market like Cloudify.\n\n541\n00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:34.060\nCloudify, they do Cloud Orchestration and\nthey're deployment independent.\n\n542\n00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:38.972\nSo they don't care if you're using VMware,\nor OpenStack, AWS.\n\n543\n00:26:38.972 --> 00:26:43.150\nYou'll see Docker and some of the other\nguys that are kinda been here.\n\n544\n00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.800\nThey don't care who you use.\n\n545\n00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.270\nYou can use them.\n\n546\n00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.730\nThey can manage Puppet.\n\n547\n00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:51.580\nAnd it's all just built right\nin this one web based platform.\n\n548\n00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.820\nAnd it gives you that central\nmanagement orchestration.\n\n549\n00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.430\nAnd they've already written deployment\nscripts for a lot of things.\n\n550\n00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:03.060\nSimilar to Cloudfly is Veeam or\nVM or however you want to say it.\n\n551\n00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:08.420\nThey were some of the first ones to\ndo this where they supported Azure,\n\n552\n00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.320\nand AWS, and Google Compute, and\n\n553\n00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.120\nyou can manage it all from one place\nas well as your private cloud.\n\n554\n00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.860\nAll, again, centrally managed and\nautomated right from here.\n\n555\n00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:22.390\nThere's an open source one, OpenStack,\nwhich Rackspace is a big player in.\n\n556\n00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.970\nAnd so\nif you're deploying things in Rackspace,\n\n557\n00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:28.520\ndefinitely you can have your private\nsystems and your Rackspace hosted systems,\n\n558\n00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.520\nand have all that managed and central.\n\n559\n00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.100\nSo when it comes to controlling this\nstuff, don't be afraid to go hybrid.\n\n560\n00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.350\nThat's what got me on this\ntangent in the first place,\n\n561\n00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:40.670\nwas you can have a private cloud or\nyou can have a public cloud.\n\n562\n00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.330\nBut don't be afraid to mix the two.\n\n563\n00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.200\nAnd that's usually\nthe migration strategies.\n\n564\n00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.160\nI might have 100 servers here in\nthe building, and so I take two or\n\n565\n00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.370\nthree of them and\nI move them to the Cloud.\n\n566\n00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.226\nThe next month I take another two or\nthree and then over time,\n\n567\n00:27:52.226 --> 00:27:54.980\nI end up with all of my mission\ncritical stuff in the Cloud.\n\n568\n00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.980\nAnd then all the rest of\nthe stuff follows, and\n\n569\n00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.195\nbefore you know it you're\nlike us here at ITProTV.\n\n570\n00:27:59.195 --> 00:28:02.045\nYou don't have any servers here in\nthe building with you because you\n\n571\n00:28:02.045 --> 00:28:02.850\ndon't need them.\n\n572\n00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.380\nRight.\nThere may be certain aspects that you have\n\n573\n00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.080\nto keep local.\n\n574\n00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.760\nThings that you just\ncan't put in the Cloud,\n\n575\n00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.940\nlike maybe you have an analog fax server.\n\n576\n00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.520\nCan't stick that in a cloud, you need\nanalog phone lines attached to it.\n\n577\n00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.250\nOr maybe you've got sensitive HR data\nthat you're just not comfortable\n\n578\n00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.050\nputting in the Cloud, so\nyou keep a local server for that.\n\n579\n00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.720\nThat will do, right.\n\n580\n00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.320\nBut the possibility is there.\n\n581\n00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.360\nYou've got that functionality,\nthe option's available to you,\n\n582\n00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.130\nyou just gotta choose which one's right.\n\n583\n00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.910\n>> That's right.\nLot of different stuff and\n\n584\n00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.630\na lot of interesting information\nthat comes along with\n\n585\n00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:31.890\nLooking at these delivery models.\n\n586\n00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.500\nWe have to understand how they work and\nwhich one applies to where so that A,\n\n587\n00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.730\nwhen we're sitting the test, we can\nanswer questions based off of that and\n\n588\n00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.820\nthat's always a good thing.\n\n589\n00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.820\nBut B,\nit becomes a practical thing for us.\n\n590\n00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.320\nAs we do start to say, you know what?\n\n591\n00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.494\nI gotta a couple of non critical systems.\n\n592\n00:28:46.494 --> 00:28:49.195\nLet me dip my toe in that cloud water and\nstart.\n\n593\n00:28:49.195 --> 00:28:51.640\nLet me move those up into the Cloud and\nstart using that.\n\n594\n00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.480\nYou can see how these delivery methods and\nsystems work for you and\n\n595\n00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.220\nwhich one is going to be best for\nthat environment.\n\n596\n00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.140\nDon, that being said, is there anything\nelse about those delivery methods and\n\n597\n00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.360\nsystems that we need to know for\nthis episode.\n\n598\n00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.830\nI think that's about it,\na lot of these terms can be confusing.\n\n599\n00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:07.640\nA lot of people on the internet\nuse them in different ways.\n\n600\n00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.740\nI've given you guys the definition\nas COMPTIA wants it,\n\n601\n00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.650\nthe one you want to be familiar with on\nthe exam, so definitely be aware of that.\n\n602\n00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:16.000\nThere are other cloud delivery models out\nthere you'll see people be referencing,\n\n603\n00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.141\nbut COMPTIA really just harps on,\nthey don't harp.\n\n604\n00:29:18.141 --> 00:29:21.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They stress on the main four, right?\n\n605\n00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.080\nPrivate cloud, public cloud,\nhybrid cloud, community cloud.\n\n606\n00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.980\nThose are the four that\nyou need to be aware of.\n\n607\n00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.790\nYou may or may not actually use\nthem out there in production, but\n\n608\n00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.050\nthose are the four you need\nto be aware of for the exam.\n\n609\n00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.150\n>> All right, Don, thank you so\nmuch for hanging out with us today,\n\n610\n00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:37.130\nand teaching us some practical advice for\nour exams and for our lives.\n\n611\n00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.020\nThat being said, thank you guys for\njoining us today.\n\n612\n00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.209\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n613\n00:29:41.209 --> 00:29:42.690\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n614\n00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:43.631\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n615\n00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:45.631\n>> And I'll see

to\nanother great episode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:18.640\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.837\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with our series on Cloud+ from CompTIA.\n\n6\n00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:25.760\nJoining us in the studio again today,\nwell, you know him.\n\n7\n00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.920\nHe's our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.870\nDon, welcome back yet again.\n\n9\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.170\nAnd thank you for joining us.\n\n10\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.040\n>> Hey, thanks for\nhaving me back on the show, Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.963\nAnd ready to jump back\ninto the world of Cloud+.\n\n12\n00:00:35.963 --> 00:00:38.863\nNow, we have reached one of those\nmoments where CompTIA gives us\n\n13\n00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:41.547\na laundry list of terminology\nwe need to be familiar with and\n\n14\n00:00:41.547 --> 00:00:44.087\nI know we're gonna have to\ngo through the terminology.\n\n15\n00:00:44.087 --> 00:00:46.943\nI know it's not terribly exciting, but\nit's actually really nice that they put\n\n16\n00:00:46.943 --> 00:00:48.587\nthis at the beginning\nof the exam objectives.\n\n17\n00:00:48.587 --> 00:00:52.057\nBecause I don't want to use terminology\nthroughout the show that you guys aren't\n\n18\n00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:52.921\nfamiliar with yet.\n\n19\n00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:55.004\nAnd here's a chance to make\nsure that we understand that.\n\n20\n00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:58.668\nSo when you deploy technologies in the\ncloud, there's a lot of interesting and\n\n21\n00:00:58.668 --> 00:01:00.230\nnew concepts.\n\n22\n00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.258\nHere's a chance for us to put names to\nthose concepts that we'll be able to use\n\n23\n00:01:03.258 --> 00:01:05.086\nto refer to throughout\nthe rest of the series.\n\n24\n00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:09.500\nSo while not the most exciting thing,\nI'll try to make it as fun as possible.\n\n25\n00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.290\nBut we just have, I don't know,\nit's about 15 words or whatever,\n\n26\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.910\nthat we just need to be familiar\nwith those concepts, and\n\n27\n00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.790\nwe'll get to see them right\nhere in this episode.\n\n28\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.088\n>> That's right.\nNow as IT people,\n\n29\n00:01:17.088 --> 00:01:19.171\nthis shouldn't be anything new to you.\n\n30\n00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:21.343\nIf you've been in the business for\nany length of time, or\n\n31\n00:01:21.343 --> 00:01:24.213\nif you've even been trying to get into\nthe business for any length of time.\n\n32\n00:01:24.213 --> 00:01:26.462\nYou're starting to see we kind\nof have our own language, right.\n\n33\n00:01:26.462 --> 00:01:27.670\nWe have our own speak.\n\n34\n00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.660\nIt's kind of like if you\nlook at military personnel,\n\n35\n00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.980\nthey speak a different language,\nreally, than the rest of us do.\n\n36\n00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.710\nThey have buzzwords and terminology that\nthey dive into, and you're just sitting\n\n37\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.390\nback listening going, I have no idea\nwhat they said, but they apparently do.\n\n38\n00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.421\nWell, the same thing is with IT.\n\n39\n00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:47.642\nAnd specifically your clown also,\nthey're gonna expand that terminology and\n\n40\n00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:51.548\nyes we're gonna get into a lovely bunch\nof acronyms and things of nature,\n\n41\n00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:53.170\nas throughout the show.\n\n42\n00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.805\nWe love our acronyms in IT.\n\n43\n00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:57.696\nBut to be able to speak that\nlanguage is gonna help us,\n\n44\n00:01:57.696 --> 00:02:02.004\nconsistently help you understand what\nit is we're talking about, and again,\n\n45\n00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:06.462\nbuild foundation of knowledge, for us to\ncontinue on with the rest of the series.\n\n46\n00:02:06.462 --> 00:02:09.463\nSo that being said, Don, I have no\nidea where to even begin with this.\n\n47\n00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:11.986\nThere's so\nmany different types of buzzwords and\n\n48\n00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:14.880\nphrases that get thrown about\nwhen it comes to the cloud.\n\n49\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.730\nWhere do we even begin\nto tackle this monster?\n\n50\n00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.462\n>> All right, Daniel.\n\n51\n00:02:17.462 --> 00:02:19.128\nLet's start with one of my, and\n\n52\n00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:22.171\nit really is my favorite feature\nof using a cloud service.\n\n53\n00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:25.599\nOne of the reasons that I really\nlove putting stuff in the cloud and\n\n54\n00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.795\nthat's elasticity.\n\n55\n00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:28.962\nElasticity, it's built\noff of the word elastic.\n\n56\n00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:30.496\n>> It's like your [INAUDIBLE].\n\n57\n00:02:30.496 --> 00:02:31.140\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n58\n00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.290\nYour happy pants for\nthanksgiving or whatever.\n\n59\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.254\nElasticity, like it's name implies,\nis the ability to stretch and contract.\n\n60\n00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:43.379\nAn elastic band is able to stretch\npretty far and then go right back again.\n\n61\n00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.035\nAnd with cloud services,\nbecause we don't own the physical servers,\n\n62\n00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:52.546\nit's really easy for us to add systems and\nremove systems as needed.\n\n63\n00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:54.056\nAnd if you're not familiar\nwith that concept,\n\n64\n00:02:54.056 --> 00:02:56.057\nI've got a little diagram here\nthat kinda helps out with this,\n\n65\n00:02:56.057 --> 00:02:57.480\nlet me bring this up here.\n\n66\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.260\nLet's say that I've got a website and\nin my website,\n\n67\n00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.546\nI have a standard flow of traffic\nthat happens on a given day.\n\n68\n00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:08.180\nAnd apparently I've got my times wrong,\nso let me just fix that real quick.\n\n69\n00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.030\nThere we go.\n\n70\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.840\nSo I've got a standard flow of traffic\nthat happens throughout a given day.\n\n71\n00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.772\nAt the beginning of my day,\nright here at midnight at 0000 hours,\n\n72\n00:03:14.772 --> 00:03:16.921\nthere's just not a whole lot of activity,\nright.\n\n73\n00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:19.470\nIt's the middle of the night.\nWho's on my website?\n\n74\n00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.255\nAnd then, as the day ticks on closer to\n6 am, I start to get a peak of traffic.\n\n75\n00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:27.460\nA lot of people hitting my website.\n\n76\n00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.660\nBut then as the morning ebbs on\ncloser to lunch, we did back down,\n\n77\n00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.900\nnot a lot of people there.\n\n78\n00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.620\nBut boy in the afternoon.\n\n79\n00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.340\nRight after lunch time, things get really\nbusy and they stay busy all the way until\n\n80\n00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.440\nlater that evening, where they then\nkinda trickle off as the night goes on.\n\n81\n00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.297\nThis is pretty typical for a website or\nreally any type of web service.\n\n82\n00:03:45.297 --> 00:03:48.726\nIf it's email or files or whatever,\nyou've got peaks and valleys,\n\n83\n00:03:48.726 --> 00:03:51.870\ntimes where your site is really busy and\ntimes your site is not.\n\n84\n00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.228\nWell, in the traditional model,\nif you had your own servers locally,\n\n85\n00:03:57.228 --> 00:04:00.262\nwhat you had to do was look\nat the peak time and say,\n\n86\n00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:04.337\nhow many servers do I need to provide\noptimal service at peak time?\n\n87\n00:04:04.337 --> 00:04:06.460\nAnd that might be ten servers.\n\n88\n00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.421\nSo at 5 AM, I need to have ten\nfully operational servers.\n\n89\n00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:15.510\nAnd at 4 PM,\nI need to have ten operational servers.\n\n90\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.320\nOkay.\n\n91\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.000\nWell, what about at 9 AM, right here.\n\n92\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.255\nI still have ten servers because it's my\nown servers, I had to buy ten servers.\n\n93\n00:04:24.255 --> 00:04:28.421\nI might only be using two of them, and the\nother eight are just sitting there idle.\n\n94\n00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:29.771\nBut it doesn't matter,\n\n95\n00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:33.379\nI've gotta have ten because as\nthings get busier I need those ten.\n\n96\n00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.171\nThat's the old model,\nthat's what we had to do.\n\n97\n00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:39.830\nThe challenge here was,\nwhat if things start getting even busier?\n\n98\n00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.770\nTen was enough, but\nthen things start to get a little busier.\n\n99\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.960\nWhat do I do?\n\n100\n00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.300\nWell, hopefully I've been tracking it so\nI can see that coming and I can say, well,\n\n101\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.670\nI need to go and order a few more servers.\n\n102\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.890\nSo let me bump my cluster up,\n\n103\n00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.980\ninstead of ten servers we'll\nmake it 12 servers and so on.\n\n104\n00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.250\nWe've got them buying new servers.\n\n105\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.337\nYou've got to requisition them.\n\n106\n00:04:59.337 --> 00:05:02.698\nIt might take a week or even two weeks\nto get those servers in, installed,\n\n107\n00:05:02.698 --> 00:05:04.410\nconfigured and deployed.\n\n108\n00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.922\nThat's the delay.\n\n109\n00:05:04.922 --> 00:05:07.090\nThat's how long it'll take for\nme to react to it.\n\n110\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.350\nWell, in this day and age,\nwhat happens if your video goes viral?\n\n111\n00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.750\nOr your service becomes super popular.\n\n112\n00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.921\nYou need those servers now.\n\n113\n00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:17.951\nIf your Twitter or Instagram, when you\nlaunch, you might be very small, and\n\n114\n00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:22.046\nthen overnight, you're an international\nsuccess, you need service fast.\n\n115\n00:05:22.046 --> 00:05:24.230\nAnd the traditional model can't do that.\n\n116\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.860\nAnd that's where\nan elastic model comes in.\n\n117\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.300\nWith cloud services, you can have an\nelastic environment, where you stretch and\n\n118\n00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.150\ncontract based on what you need.\n\n119\n00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.337\nSo at 4 AM,\nyou might only need seven servers.\n\n120\n00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:40.060\nSo you have seven servers.\n\n121\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.110\nAnd then, at 5 AM,\nyou jump up to ten servers.\n\n122\n00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.213\nBut then, by 9 AM, you drop down to two.\n\n123\n00:05:45.213 --> 00:05:48.100\nAnd then as the day goes on,\nyou crank it back up.\n\n124\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.296\nYou just have the amount of\nservers you need for the time.\n\n125\n00:05:50.296 --> 00:05:54.522\nAnd if your video goes viral and\nall of the sudden you need 50 servers,\n\n126\n00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:56.712\nwell it just goes up to 50 servers.\n\n127\n00:05:56.712 --> 00:06:00.379\nYou set a limit on how high you want it\nto go, but it can go as fast as you want.\n\n128\n00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.161\nSo if you're the next Twitter,\n\n129\n00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:07.245\nyou go from five servers to 5,000 servers\novernight, a cloud service can do that.\n\n130\n00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:10.865\nAnd it's just a click of your mouse and\nyou're at 5,000 servers.\n\n131\n00:06:10.865 --> 00:06:15.880\nSo that's elasticity, and it's the biggest\nadvantage of going to a cloud service.\n\n132\n00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.280\nCuz with a cloud service,\nyou only pay for what you use.\n\n133\n00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.800\nSo if I'm using ten servers,\nI'm paying for ten servers.\n\n134\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.587\nBut if I'm only using two,\nI only pay for two.\n\n135\n00:06:23.587 --> 00:06:26.670\nI don't pay for\nthe other eight serves that I'm not using.\n\n136\n00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.212\nWhich in the traditional model, right\nhere, I'm still paying for ten servers.\n\n137\n00:06:31.212 --> 00:06:32.319\nIn fact, I paid for\n\n138\n00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:36.004\nthem all up front versus a cloud\nservice where you pay as you go.\n\n139\n00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:37.046\nSo that's a big advantage there.\n\n140\n00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:40.000\nAgain for startups, you might not have\na lot of capital, you start small.\n\n141\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.963\nAnd as your usage goes up, your revenue\ngoes up, and things are more in line.\n\n142\n00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:47.551\nSo elasticity makes a cloud\nservice more in line with\n\n143\n00:06:47.551 --> 00:06:50.005\nyour company's actual business.\n\n144\n00:06:50.005 --> 00:06:51.480\nAnd it is, in my opinion,\n\n145\n00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.340\nthe single biggest benefit\nof going to a cloud service.\n\n146\n00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.940\n>> So it's your ability to auto scale\nis what defines your elasticity?\n\n147\n00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.330\n>> Yes and\nthere's different words for those.\n\n148\n00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.213\nWants you to know elasticity or elastic.\n\n149\n00:07:05.213 --> 00:07:11.254\nBut Amazon has auto scaling, Microsoft\nhas their, heck, what is theirs called?\n\n150\n00:07:11.254 --> 00:07:12.546\nI don't know, something.\n\n151\n00:07:12.546 --> 00:07:14.211\nSo they all have different names for\nit, but\n\n152\n00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:15.837\nat the end of the day there's elasticity.\n\n153\n00:07:15.837 --> 00:07:18.307\nAmazon uses the term elastic through\na lot of their stuff, and so\n\n154\n00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:20.750\nother vendors try not to use it,\nbut this is the official term.\n\n155\n00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:28.260\nAll right, another term is on demand\nself serve, or just in time service.\n\n156\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.900\nNow, it's very similar to this.\n\n157\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.900\nRight here,\nmy servers can automatically grow.\n\n158\n00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.058\nI can manually grow them.\n\n159\n00:07:35.058 --> 00:07:39.630\nI can self-serve, I can go in and\nspin them up or I can have this automated.\n\n160\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.282\nAnd with auto-scaling,\nDaniel you mentioned,\n\n161\n00:07:41.282 --> 00:07:43.300\nthat's an example where this\ncan happen automatically.\n\n162\n00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.003\nLet me show you, for example, on AWS.\n\n163\n00:07:47.003 --> 00:07:48.150\nSo here's Amazon web services.\n\n164\n00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.636\nI'm logged into my console, and I'm logged\ninto EC2, which is elastic compute cloud.\n\n165\n00:07:52.636 --> 00:07:54.652\nThat's where I can bring up servers,\n\n166\n00:07:54.652 --> 00:07:58.506\nand you can see I've got a server\nright here in itprotv Database server.\n\n167\n00:07:58.506 --> 00:08:00.656\nWell, maybe I want a web server, okay?\n\n168\n00:08:00.656 --> 00:08:04.280\nWell, in the traditional model, I've gotta\ngo get approval to add a web server.\n\n169\n00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.800\nThen I've gotta go and get a quote.\n\n170\n00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:11.280\nThen I've got to go and\nget an invoice, or a PO issued, right?\n\n171\n00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.216\nSend it in, purchase the server, get it\nin, install it, all this stuff, right?\n\n172\n00:08:14.216 --> 00:08:16.851\nIt can take a week,\ntwo weeks, however long.\n\n173\n00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:20.630\nBut with a cloud instance I pay for\nwhat I use.\n\n174\n00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.400\nAnd I can spin things up instantly.\n\n175\n00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.590\nI can just hit launch instance, and\nI can tell it what I want, right?\n\n176\n00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.300\nMaybe I want a Linux server or\na Windows server or whatever.\n\n177\n00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.130\nI'll pick a Linux server.\n\n178\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.410\nAnd I can pick how much I\nneed in the way of resources.\n\n179\n00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:37.850\nDo I need 1 CPU, 2 CPUs,\ndo I need 40 CPUs, right?\n\n180\n00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.830\nHow much memory do I need?\n\n181\n00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.800\nDo I need 1 gig of RAM, 8 gigs of RAM?\n\n182\n00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.310\nMaybe I'll go 2 CPUs and\n8 gigs of RAM, all right?\n\n183\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.885\nSo I'll go ahead and pick that model.\n\n184\n00:08:44.885 --> 00:08:49.785\nAnd then I can just go and configure it\nhow I need it, adding network settings,\n\n185\n00:08:49.785 --> 00:08:51.130\nhow many instances.\n\n186\n00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.620\nI can do more than one\ninstance all at once.\n\n187\n00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.760\nI can launch it into an Auto Scaling\ngroup so it can grow and\n\n188\n00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.190\ncontract based on my utilization.\n\n189\n00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.940\nI can add hard drive storage.\n\n190\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.930\nDo I need just 8 gigs of storage,\nwhich is what it comes with, or\n\n191\n00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:05.910\ndo I wanna add more?\n\n192\n00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.040\nIt's a web server, maybe my website\nhappens to be a couple extra gigs in size.\n\n193\n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.330\nSo I want to add some more storage for it.\n\n194\n00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.479\nSo I can come in and\nadd another hard drive, right?\n\n195\n00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:16.930\nJust going to add 64 gigs of\ngeneral purpose storage, right?\n\n196\n00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.920\nSo we can just plug all this in as we go.\n\n197\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.300\nI'll give it a name,\nthis will be itprotv-web01.\n\n198\n00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.510\nAnd we'll launch it.\n\n199\n00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:29.700\nAnd when that launches, now I got to do my\nauthentication key there, but there we go.\n\n200\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.750\nWhen that launches,\nI've now got a new server on my network.\n\n201\n00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.160\nAnd it's already running Linux,\nLinux is already installed.\n\n202\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.090\nit's up and running.\n\n203\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.443\nI just need to configure it to\nthe way that I want it, right?\n\n204\n00:09:38.443 --> 00:09:40.390\nIt's that quickly, it's self service.\n\n205\n00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.520\nI didn't have to call Amazon.\n\n206\n00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.960\nI didn't have to get them involved.\n\n207\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.580\nIt's self service,\nI did it myself, and just in time.\n\n208\n00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.219\nIf my servers are getting busy and\nI need to bump this up, I can do it.\n\n209\n00:09:50.219 --> 00:09:52.717\nI can do it right then at\nthat moment when I need it.\n\n210\n00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.880\nAnd we can automate it with\nAuto Scaling or we can do it by hand.\n\n211\n00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.200\nAnd that doesn't just limit\nme to creating new instances.\n\n212\n00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.970\nSo for example, I've got this other\none here, the database server.\n\n213\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.550\nAnd maybe the database starts\nrunning a little slow.\n\n214\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:08.820\nWell, with databases you can\nonly have one writable copy.\n\n215\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.190\nYou can read from more than one data base.\n\n216\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.540\nBut you can only write to one,\nto keep it consistent.\n\n217\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.390\nSo if this one's getting slow,\nI might want to add more memory or\n\n218\n00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.130\nadd more CPU to it.\n\n219\n00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.900\nAnd fortunately we can do that,\nit's not that hard.\n\n220\n00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.365\nYou choose your instance, and\nyou go up here to Actions.\n\n221\n00:10:24.365 --> 00:10:25.933\nAnd you'll see in here, I mean,\n\n222\n00:10:25.933 --> 00:10:29.641\njust a ton of different options as far\nas Instance State, Instance Settings.\n\n223\n00:10:29.641 --> 00:10:31.558\nAnd when you go under Instance Settings,\n\n224\n00:10:31.558 --> 00:10:34.920\nhere's where you'll see you can\nthrow it into a scaling group.\n\n225\n00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.887\nYou can change the instance type, which is\nwhere we can add more CPU or memory, or\n\n226\n00:10:39.887 --> 00:10:43.264\nwhatever, and\nsome of the other options that we have.\n\n227\n00:10:43.264 --> 00:10:46.057\nNow, some of the systems allow\nus to do this while it's online.\n\n228\n00:10:46.057 --> 00:10:49.070\nI've chosen one that's not allowing\nme to do it while it's online.\n\n229\n00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.844\nSo I'd have to shut that instance down and\nthen I could change its type.\n\n230\n00:10:51.844 --> 00:10:54.582\nIf you're gonna add memory or\na CPU to a physical server,\n\n231\n00:10:54.582 --> 00:10:56.770\ndo you have to shut it off first?\n\n232\n00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.700\nYes, so same thing really goes on here.\n\n233\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.270\nAnd it's a limitation of\nthe operating system.\n\n234\n00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:06.222\nSo if I take that instance and shut it\ndown, so I'll just come in here and\n\n235\n00:11:06.222 --> 00:11:06.896\nstop it.\n\n236\n00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:09.674\nYep, so it's gonna shut that\ninstance down and take it offline.\n\n237\n00:11:09.674 --> 00:11:11.171\nOnce it's offline, I can edit it.\n\n238\n00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:14.890\nAnd I can add more memory,\nmore CPU, more hard drive space.\n\n239\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:20.010\nI can add whatever I need and scale it\nup just in time, when I need it, right?\n\n240\n00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.040\nSelf service, I'm doing this on my own.\n\n241\n00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.920\nThose are all big advantages of cloud.\n\n242\n00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.450\nSo the terms there, on-demand self\nserve and just in time service.\n\n243\n00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.120\n>> Now, one of my favorite pieces of\nterminology when it comes to cloud\n\n244\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.340\nservices is because I come from\na not very affluential background.\n\n245\n00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.335\nIt is pay as you grow, right?\n\n246\n00:11:38.335 --> 00:11:42.770\nI'm only paying for what I need when\nI need it, and that's the basic idea.\n\n247\n00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.510\nBut Don, you're gonna get\na little more detailed than that.\n\n248\n00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.890\n>> Yeah, yeah I mentioned it a few times,\n\n249\n00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.370\nwith cloud services you normally\nonly pay for what you use.\n\n250\n00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.820\nAnd that's cool, right,\nbecause I might not be very busy today.\n\n251\n00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.900\nBut I might be really busy tomorrow,\nor I might have a seasonal business,\n\n252\n00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.590\nwhere in December I'm really,\nreally busy for those holiday sales.\n\n253\n00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.990\nBut the rest of the year not so busy.\n\n254\n00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.610\nOr a tax business, so\nat tax season you're really busy.\n\n255\n00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.660\nThe rest of the year you really aren't.\n\n256\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.210\nYou hate to pay for servers year around\nwhen you only need them at one time.\n\n257\n00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.610\nSo you can use services like AWS or\nMicrosoft's Azure, or Rackspace.\n\n258\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.640\nAnd just get what you need\nat that particular time.\n\n259\n00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.640\nLet me show you Amazon's pricing.\n\n260\n00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.150\nSo this changes fairly often so\ndon't do any quotes based off of this.\n\n261\n00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.130\nBut always look it up on their site.\n\n262\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.960\nBut they're transparent\nabout their pricing.\n\n263\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.540\nAnd so they show on-demand instances.\n\n264\n00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:33.080\nIf you spin a computer up right now, and\nyou go with Linux or Red Hat or Windows,\n\n265\n00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.650\nthere's different pricing based on the\noperating system because Linux is free,\n\n266\n00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:37.350\nWindows is not.\n\n267\n00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.790\nThey had to bake that into the price.\n\n268\n00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.636\nBut if you look at it I spun up an\nm4.large just a moment ago, 2 processors,\n\n269\n00:12:44.636 --> 00:12:45.740\n8 gigs of RAM.\n\n270\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.096\nAnd you'll see it's going\nto cost me $0.12 per hour.\n\n271\n00:12:48.096 --> 00:12:51.340\nWhen the machine's running\nI'm paying $0.12 per hour.\n\n272\n00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.440\nIf I shut it down I'm not\npaying $0.12 an hour, right?\n\n273\n00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.965\nYou pay for the storage you're using.\n\n274\n00:12:55.965 --> 00:13:00.120\nBut otherwise, the CPU and RAM go back,\nyou're not paying $0.12 an hour.\n\n275\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.430\nIf I delete the virtual machine,\nI'm not paying anything.\n\n276\n00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.700\nSo unlike a physical server where I have\nto buy it and then when I'm done with it\n\n277\n00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.920\nmaybe I can sell it on Ebay for\npretty big price cut, normally, right?\n\n278\n00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.900\nYou lose a good bit of value,\nmaybe that would work.\n\n279\n00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.634\nBut here, I just use it and\nwhen I'm done I turn it off, right?\n\n280\n00:13:18.634 --> 00:13:20.221\nAnd that's it and\nI don't pay for it anymore.\n\n281\n00:13:20.221 --> 00:13:24.177\nSo $0.12 per hour to get 2 CPUs and\n8 gigs of RAM, that's pretty good.\n\n282\n00:13:24.177 --> 00:13:29.976\nYou can get really high-end systems,\nlike 40 CPUs and 160 gigs of RAM.\n\n283\n00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.519\nIt's gonna cost you $2.40 per hour.\n\n284\n00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:34.213\nThat adds up pretty quick.\n\n285\n00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:36.811\n24 hours in a day, 30 days in a month,\n\n286\n00:13:36.811 --> 00:13:42.620\nthis server might cost you $2,000 over\na month, but to buy it would cost a ton.\n\n287\n00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.740\nAnd if I only need it for a little while,\nhere's that chance for me to get it.\n\n288\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.210\nSo pay as you grow.\n\n289\n00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:51.410\nAs my services start to get busier,\nI add more servers and I'm paying more.\n\n290\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.256\nBut because I'm getting busy, that\nusually means my revenues are going up.\n\n291\n00:13:54.256 --> 00:13:56.320\nAnd I can afford to pay more,\nand it works out.\n\n292\n00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.670\nSo if you're an Internet startup, you\ncan spin up five servers and it's cheap.\n\n293\n00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.720\nAnd then you can grow to 5,000 servers.\n\n294\n00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.970\nAnd you're completely insulated\nfrom that and covered.\n\n295\n00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.240\n>> Yeah Don, I'm sure like me,\nyou've had server rooms\n\n296\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.730\nfull of servers that are basically just\nsitting on the floor, collecting dust,\n\n297\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.430\ndoing absolutely nothing because maybe\nthey've reached the end of life or\n\n298\n00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.470\nwe've replaced them, done something else.\n\n299\n00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.960\nAnd we paid money for those,\ngood money for those.\n\n300\n00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.239\nAnd now we gotta try to go on eBay and\nget rid of them, or\n\n301\n00:14:20.239 --> 00:14:22.141\njust probably eventually just chuck them.\n\n302\n00:14:22.141 --> 00:14:23.515\nA lot of people do that.\n\n303\n00:14:23.515 --> 00:14:27.264\nSo this is definitely one of my\nfavorite aspects of cloud services,\n\n304\n00:14:27.264 --> 00:14:29.849\nthat I don't need it\nanymore I just delete it.\n\n305\n00:14:29.849 --> 00:14:31.394\nIt's gone, I don't pay anything.\n\n306\n00:14:31.394 --> 00:14:34.670\nBut if my company continues to grow,\nwell, It's there for me.\n\n307\n00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.870\nI can add all the servers that I need\nwith all the horsepower that I need.\n\n308\n00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.130\nThat pay as you grow feature is really,\nreally, I like it.\n\n309\n00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.722\nI like it a lot,\nI'm just gonna leave it at that.\n\n310\n00:14:45.722 --> 00:14:48.805\nNow, what else is some of the terminology\nwe might need to be familiar with?\n\n311\n00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:52.473\n>> In line with paying, there's\nsomething called chargeback, all right?\n\n312\n00:14:52.473 --> 00:14:56.650\nIn most companies, an IT department\nis viewed as a cost center, right?\n\n313\n00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:57.410\nFor example,\n\n314\n00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.720\nif you work at an insurance company, the\ncompany makes money by selling insurance.\n\n315\n00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.980\nThe company doesn't make\nmoney by having servers.\n\n316\n00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.900\nAnd so the IT department is costing\nthe company money each month and\n\n317\n00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.610\nnot generating revenue.\n\n318\n00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.000\nBut it's not the IT department's fault.\n\n319\n00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.270\nThey have servers that support\nthe various business units.\n\n320\n00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.740\nSo in a lot of organizations, your virtual\nmachines or your physical machines or\n\n321\n00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.390\nwhatever, you take the cost of them and\n\n322\n00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.420\nyou bill them back to the departments\ninside of your company.\n\n323\n00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.630\nSo I might have a server that is just for\nthe claims department, or just for\n\n324\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.030\nthe accounting department.\n\n325\n00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.593\nAnd I take the cost of that server and\nI bill it to the accounting department.\n\n326\n00:15:28.593 --> 00:15:31.380\nYou're effectively charging yourself,\na company is charging itself.\n\n327\n00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:35.590\nBut it's making sure those costs\nare assigned to the right departments.\n\n328\n00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.188\nAnd in most cloud services,\n\n329\n00:15:37.188 --> 00:15:41.260\nyou can tag your virtual machines to\nsay who it's actually attached to.\n\n330\n00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.265\nAnd that way when you get your bill at the\nend of the month, you know how to bill it.\n\n331\n00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:47.235\nSo for example, I've got my\nAmazon Web Services bill pulled up here.\n\n332\n00:15:47.235 --> 00:15:50.810\nAnd my pricing period just reset, so\nI don't have a whole lot on here.\n\n333\n00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.791\nI have a whopping $1.01 charge.\n\n334\n00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:54.132\nBut [LAUGH] you can look at it and\n\n335\n00:15:54.132 --> 00:15:56.870\nsee how it's dividing it up\namongst the various services and\n\n336\n00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.483\nshowing how much that charge is going to\nbe and what service that's applied to.\n\n337\n00:16:00.483 --> 00:16:04.586\nYou can create your own custom tags, and\nthen they're cost allocation tags, and\n\n338\n00:16:04.586 --> 00:16:06.072\nthen you can divide those up,\n\n339\n00:16:06.072 --> 00:16:09.000\nso that you know exactly what\nthose costs are assigned to.\n\n340\n00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.060\nSo you can do chargebacks.\n\n341\n00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.200\nSo chargeback is just where\nyou bill the cloud services or\n\n342\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.920\njust server services in general back to\na department inside of your organization.\n\n343\n00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.200\nAll right, let's see what else we have.\n\n344\n00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.360\nUbiquitous access.\n\n345\n00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.660\nUbiquitous access is one that you'll\nsee compt here referred to a lot\n\n346\n00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.750\nbecause it's in the NIST definition for\ncloud services.\n\n347\n00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.860\nWhen we talk about a cloud service,\n\n348\n00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.160\nubiquitous access means\nthat it's available.\n\n349\n00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.320\nAnywhere, right?\n\n350\n00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.310\nThat I could be in my office or I could be\nat home, or I could be in another country\n\n351\n00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.640\nand I'll be able to fire up my web\nbrowser and access that server.\n\n352\n00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.990\nIt's ubiquitous, the access is everywhere.\n\n353\n00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.930\nNow you'll see the terminology different\nways in different places, so for\n\n354\n00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.360\nexample, ubiquitous access might mean that\n\n355\n00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.250\nIt's available regardless of what\noperating system you're on, right?\n\n356\n00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.820\nSo I don't care if you're on Windows,\nor Linux, or Mac OS.\n\n357\n00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.010\nI don't care if you're using\nGoogle Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, or\n\n358\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.390\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer.\n\n359\n00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.320\nYou're able to access the application.\n\n360\n00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.410\nBut as far as COMP-T is concerned,\nit's really access to the cloud service,\n\n361\n00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.000\nthat you can get there from\nanywhere in the world and\n\n362\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.350\nmost cloud services provide that.\n\n363\n00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:11.860\nIf you've got a public cloud or\n\n364\n00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.680\nhybrid cloud there's resources that\nare available from anywhere in the world.\n\n365\n00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.250\nYou have ubiquitous access.\n\n366\n00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.980\n>> That's right.\n\n367\n00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.280\nNow, again, here we go again.\n\n368\n00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.845\nYou'll notice there's a trend when\nit comes to cloud services and\n\n369\n00:17:21.845 --> 00:17:23.510\nthat it is all about monetary.\n\n370\n00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.730\nIt's a monetary aspect to it.\n\n371\n00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.640\nIt saves you a lot of money\nin a lot of different ways.\n\n372\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.430\nAnd one of those ways can be by\nmetering the resource point.\n\n373\n00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.805\nThis is the terminology you'll hear.\n\n374\n00:17:34.805 --> 00:17:37.985\nBut Don,\nhelp us understand what that means.\n\n375\n00:17:37.985 --> 00:17:39.185\n>> Okay.\nSo, a minute ago,\n\n376\n00:17:39.185 --> 00:17:43.035\nI said it's great how we only pay for\nwhat we use, right?\n\n377\n00:17:43.035 --> 00:17:45.915\nSo if I have a bunch of servers\nthat I need, and I pay for\n\n378\n00:17:45.915 --> 00:17:49.385\nthem while I'm using them, and then I shut\nthem down, I don't pay for them, right?\n\n379\n00:17:49.385 --> 00:17:51.765\nBut there is a time where\nwe don't have that.\n\n380\n00:17:51.765 --> 00:17:55.090\nWhen you pay for what you need,\nor pay for what you use.\n\n381\n00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.240\nThere is the possibility that I\ncould go to spin up some servers and\n\n382\n00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.520\nAmazon could say,\nsorry we don't have any space right now.\n\n383\n00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.720\nThey're out of space.\n\n384\n00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.870\nAnd so I want to pay for those servers.\n\n385\n00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.600\nI want them but they're not available and\nI don't get them.\n\n386\n00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.060\nSo most of the providers like Microsoft\nand Amazon, provide a way for\n\n387\n00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.990\nyou to reserve space.\n\n388\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:16.110\nBut when you're resource space now, we're\npaying for it even if we don't use it, and\n\n389\n00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.630\nthat's a bit of a problem, right?\n\n390\n00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.590\nA great example is a database.\n\n391\n00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.750\nLet me show you here in Azure.\n\n392\n00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.960\nSo I'm in Microsoft Azure.\n\n393\n00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.720\nThis is their Cloud service, and\nmaybe I wanna speed up a database.\n\n394\n00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.770\nSo I go into my SQL database here.\n\n395\n00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.270\nAnd I've already got one, but\nI'm gonna speed up a new one.\n\n396\n00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.450\nSo I'm gonna create a new database.\n\n397\n00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.840\nAnd when I launch this new database.\n\n398\n00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.560\nIt's going to ask me for\nsome basic things.\n\n399\n00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.460\nLike a name.\n\n400\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.120\nSo I might call this, sample DB2.\n\n401\n00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.070\nAnd then I can pick my server\nthat it's going to be hosted on.\n\n402\n00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.660\nSo I've already got a server,\nI'll pick that one.\n\n403\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.220\nAnd I can pick whether it's\na blank database or whatever and\n\n404\n00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.800\nthen I can pick my pricing tier.\n\n405\n00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.600\nThe pricing tier is how much I\nwant to pay for this database.\n\n406\n00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.760\nAnd when you look at it,\nsee how it says I get 125 DTU's and\n\n407\n00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.250\n500 gigs of storage and so on.\n\n408\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.880\nAnd if I, let me just do view all real\nquick here so I can see them all.\n\n409\n00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.930\nIf I scroll down you'll see\nsome of them list whether\n\n410\n00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.070\nthey have replication support and so on.\n\n411\n00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.680\nBut the key thing that I\nwant you to look out for\n\n412\n00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.260\nare these DTUs these\ndatabase throughput units.\n\n413\n00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.200\nThere are basically how many\ntransactions per second they can handle.\n\n414\n00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.740\nAnd a key aspect of that\nIs how many disk reads and\n\n415\n00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.090\ndisk writes they can perform per second.\n\n416\n00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.855\nMicrosoft calls those IOPS, right?\n\n417\n00:19:27.855 --> 00:19:30.790\nInput output operations per second.\n\n418\n00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.550\nAnd when you provision a database,\nthis is a guarantee.\n\n419\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:34.710\nI'm guaranteed 1,000 DTUs.\n\n420\n00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.590\nSo if I have this database,\n\n421\n00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.340\nI'll be able to pull off approximately\n1000 transactions per second.\n\n422\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.290\nAnd some of these other ones can go\neven higher, some as low as ten.\n\n423\n00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.350\nFive, I think the basic is five.\n\n424\n00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.110\nWhere is basic?\n\n425\n00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.040\nYeah, right here.\nFive.\n\n426\n00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.340\nSo, five transactions per second.\n\n427\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.520\nThat's not a lot, right,\nbut that may be all I need.\n\n428\n00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:57.300\nSo if I go and\ncreate one that's got a thousand DTUs, But\n\n429\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.600\nI'm only using 200 DTU's doesn't matter,\nI paid for a thousand, okay.\n\n430\n00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.780\nSo now I start to lose\nsome of that advantage, so\n\n431\n00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:09.100\ninstead of creating individual databases\nlike this, I can create a pool and\n\n432\n00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.500\nI can put databases in the pool and\nthey can share the resource,\n\n433\n00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.980\nthen my database may have access\nto a thousand if it needs it, or\n\n434\n00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.470\nit may not, and so\nI can create one of those real quick.\n\n435\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.580\nLet me jump onto my servers here and I'll\nshow you where that is so if I go into my\n\n436\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:27.110\nSQL servers here my data base servers\nI've got this New Pool option.\n\n437\n00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:33.720\nAnd I can create a new pool and\nover here I can specify a pool name.\n\n438\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.260\nSo I might call this\nlike ITPROTV D B pool and\n\n439\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.970\nthen I can specify\nthe pricing tier of the pool.\n\n440\n00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:46.050\nAnd so\nI might choose to set mine to 1000 DTUs,\n\n441\n00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.920\nwhich is not a default ones apparently.\n\n442\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.330\nSo let's jump to,\nhere we'll do a premium pool.\n\n443\n00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.510\nWe're going to go premium,\nwe're going to spend all of our money.\n\n444\n00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.000\nSo I'll go out with a premium pool,\nthere we go.\n\n445\n00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.920\n125 eDTU pool with 0\ndatabases in it right now, so\n\n446\n00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.170\nit's giving me my approximate cost,\nand I can configure the pool.\n\n447\n00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:05.650\nThis is what I'm looking for.\n\n448\n00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.220\nAnd when I can figure the pool,\n\n449\n00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.830\nI can specify exactly how many\nDTs I want in the stinking thing.\n\n450\n00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.460\nSo I can come down here and\nset my pools, and I want 1000.\n\n451\n00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.760\nSo I'm setting a pool database of 1000.\n\n452\n00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.830\nSo when I started created databases and\nthrowing them in this pool,\n\n453\n00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.860\nThere will be a thousand dtus\nthat are shared between them.\n\n454\n00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.610\nSo I might have one database\nat 900 DTU'S this second but\n\n455\n00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.520\nat a hundred DTU'S the next second.\n\n456\n00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.050\nAnd I frees up those DTU'S for another\ndatabase and so now they share them.\n\n457\n00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.120\nAnd so\nthis is called metered resource pooling.\n\n458\n00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.850\nMetered resource, in this case, they're\nmy DTU's, my database throughput units.\n\n459\n00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:46.860\nIt could be disk IO, it could be\nCPU cycles, it could be whatever,\n\n460\n00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.820\nthat's the metered resource.\n\n461\n00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.960\nAnd then I've created a pool that's\nnow shared between these databases.\n\n462\n00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:58.860\nAnd so, while having reserved resources\nkinda loses some of the cloud benefits?\n\n463\n00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.310\nYou get them back again when\nyou create a pool around it.\n\n464\n00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.830\nSo this is a metered resource pool.\n\n465\n00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.870\n>> Very cool stuff, and\na cool way to share those.\n\n466\n00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.510\nLike you said,\nwe're sharing those resources around\n\n467\n00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.210\nall the different databases we have, so\n\n468\n00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:16.500\nnot any one has all the full capacity and\nthe others are left kind of high and dry.\n\n469\n00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.310\nthey all get equal say\nin what goes on there.\n\n470\n00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:23.420\nNow kind of along the same vein but\nin a different way is when you think\n\n471\n00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.580\nof cloud a lot of times you gotta\nthink of yourself as living in a dorm.\n\n472\n00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.100\nRight?\n\n473\n00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.210\nBecause you're not the only\nguy in the building.\n\n474\n00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.670\nYou're probably sharing that resource with\n\n475\n00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.200\nother people that aren't\neven part of your business.\n\n476\n00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.870\nAnd they call this correct me\nif I'm wrong is multi-tentancy.\n\n477\n00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:39.570\n>> That's right, yeah.\n\n478\n00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.120\nAnd it's a term that comes\nfrom apartments right?\n\n479\n00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.590\nYou know, multi-tenant buildings.\n\n480\n00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.330\nThat your physical servers\nare multi-tenant servers.\n\n481\n00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.140\nYou have more than one customer on those\nphysical servers, on that storage,\n\n482\n00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.270\ncrossing that network.\n\n483\n00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:54.020\nAll the resources used in the cloud could\npotentially be used by somebody else,\n\n484\n00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.370\nand already have been.\n\n485\n00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.690\nWhen you spin up a server in\nthe cloud you get an IP address.\n\n486\n00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.370\nWell I guarantee you somebody\nelse had that IP address before,\n\n487\n00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:02.570\nyou just have it now.\n\n488\n00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.000\nAnd your storage, it was provisioned\nto somebody else before.\n\n489\n00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.980\nYou have it now.\n\n490\n00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:10.180\nNow the vendors, they usually take\nthe care to erase the storage,\n\n491\n00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.810\nclear everything out so\nit looks fresh and new to you.\n\n492\n00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:16.280\nBut things can happen, you can have where\n\n493\n00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.610\nmaybe whoever had the IP address before\nyou did some really bad stuff and\n\n494\n00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:24.190\ngot it blacklisted and now you spin\nup your Hello Kitty fan website, And\n\n495\n00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.140\nit's blacklisted for illegal activity\njust because somebody previously used it.\n\n496\n00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:32.090\nThat's the risk with multi tendency, and\nevery cloud service has that same risk,\n\n497\n00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:33.860\nyou know it's just part of the process.\n\n498\n00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.494\n>> All Hello Kitty websites get\nblacklisted Don, let's be honest.\n\n499\n00:23:37.494 --> 00:23:39.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Probably some truth to that.\n\n500\n00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.490\n>> But anyhow, so there is some risk,\nso we just need to be aware of that.\n\n501\n00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.670\nBut multi-tendency refers to the fact that\nyou're using systems that are shared with\n\n502\n00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:48.270\nother customers, and\nyou have no visibility into that,\n\n503\n00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.090\nit's completely hidden from you.\n\n504\n00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:51.304\n>> Now another cool topic.\n\n505\n00:23:51.304 --> 00:23:56.197\nTerminology should I say that we're gonna\ngo and when I hear myself say this I\n\n506\n00:23:56.197 --> 00:24:01.338\nthink of having a lot of base and echo and\nmaybe some reverb and thunder crashes.\n\n507\n00:24:01.338 --> 00:24:02.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cloud bursting, right.\n\n508\n00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.984\nBoom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n509\n00:24:03.984 --> 00:24:06.260\n>> Cloud bursting that's\nan interesting concept, though.\n\n510\n00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.258\n>> Cloud bursting.\n\n511\n00:24:07.258 --> 00:24:12.103\nCloud bursting is great for companies\nthat maybe don't have huge budgets, but\n\n512\n00:24:12.103 --> 00:24:15.874\nat the same time aren't ready\nto put their stuff in the cloud.\n\n513\n00:24:15.874 --> 00:24:20.312\nSo maybe I'm an internet startup, I come\nup with some new idea and I love it.\n\n514\n00:24:20.312 --> 00:24:22.134\nBut boy, I wanna manage my own servers.\n\n515\n00:24:22.134 --> 00:24:25.682\nSo we go and we buy five physical servers,\nwe put them right here under my desk, so\n\n516\n00:24:25.682 --> 00:24:26.952\nI keep things nice and warm.\n\n517\n00:24:26.952 --> 00:24:28.380\nSo, I've got these five servers running.\n\n518\n00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.568\nWe developed, we create this great new\nwebsite that everybody's gonna love and\n\n519\n00:24:32.568 --> 00:24:36.695\nthen we release it to the internet and\n5 people find out about it, 10 people,\n\n520\n00:24:36.695 --> 00:24:37.633\na 100 people.\n\n521\n00:24:37.633 --> 00:24:42.232\nMy five servers are running great and\nthen it hits Twitter, it hits YouTube,\n\n522\n00:24:42.232 --> 00:24:43.380\nit hits whatever.\n\n523\n00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.734\nAnd all of a sudden, I've got hundred\nthousand people trying to hit my site\n\n524\n00:24:46.734 --> 00:24:48.768\nright now and\nmy five of my servers collapse.\n\n525\n00:24:48.768 --> 00:24:52.121\nWell, I could have avoided that if I put\nit all on the cloud in the first place.\n\n526\n00:24:52.121 --> 00:24:54.942\nWe could have just scaled up,\nno big deal, but I wasn't ready for that.\n\n527\n00:24:54.942 --> 00:24:57.763\nI wanted it to be here with me,\nI wanted control.\n\n528\n00:24:57.763 --> 00:25:00.782\nSo, what you could do is you could\nleverage a hybrid environment.\n\n529\n00:25:00.782 --> 00:25:03.109\nI know we talked about hybrid\nclouds in another episode, but\n\n530\n00:25:03.109 --> 00:25:05.403\nwe could do a hybrid environment\nwhere my servers are here.\n\n531\n00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:10.378\nMy five servers are right here with me and\nthey're doing the service,\n\n532\n00:25:10.378 --> 00:25:15.457\nbut as resources run out, I scale by\nadding new instances in the cloud.\n\n533\n00:25:15.457 --> 00:25:16.803\nI do cloud bursting.\n\n534\n00:25:16.803 --> 00:25:18.242\nSo, I have my five servers here.\n\n535\n00:25:18.242 --> 00:25:22.485\nI'm always gonna have my five servers\nhere, but I might have one server in\n\n536\n00:25:22.485 --> 00:25:26.264\nthe cloud or a thousand servers in\nthe cloud as I need that demand.\n\n537\n00:25:26.264 --> 00:25:29.061\nAs I have the viewers hitting my site and\nI need to scale up for that, and\n\n538\n00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:30.010\nthen we scale down, and\n\n539\n00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.486\nI might have no servers up in the cloud,\nand everything's back here in-house again.\n\n540\n00:25:33.486 --> 00:25:37.920\nHaving cloud bursting is a neat way to\ncover a special seasonal activities.\n\n541\n00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.817\nWhere from mostly,\n\n542\n00:25:38.817 --> 00:25:41.893\nyou just want in-house service you\nwont pay anybody else for those.\n\n543\n00:25:41.893 --> 00:25:45.584\nBut then when you hit that holidays\nseason, or taxis, whatever it is create\n\n544\n00:25:45.584 --> 00:25:48.710\nyour seasonal business,\nyou ramp up with servers in the cloud.\n\n545\n00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.078\nAnd when that season's over,\nyou take the cloud servers away.\n\n546\n00:25:51.078 --> 00:25:53.254\nThat's cloud bursting,\nit's a neat technology,\n\n547\n00:25:53.254 --> 00:25:56.320\nit does require setting up things like\na VPN between your organization and\n\n548\n00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.667\nthe cloud to synchronize data.\n\n549\n00:25:57.667 --> 00:26:00.610\nThere's a lot of other back-end\ninfrastructure that has to be setup, but\n\n550\n00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:01.788\nit's a really cool concept.\n\n551\n00:26:01.788 --> 00:26:02.417\n>> Awesome.\n\n552\n00:26:02.417 --> 00:26:05.109\nWe go through a lot of different\nterminology and concepts.\n\n553\n00:26:05.109 --> 00:26:08.568\nNow, is there anything else that we\nneed to cover before we close this show?\n\n554\n00:26:08.568 --> 00:26:11.655\n>> The two last terms we kind\nof already talked about.\n\n555\n00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:14.676\nRapid deployment, which with the cloud\nis one of your big benefits.\n\n556\n00:26:14.676 --> 00:26:18.218\nYou can spin up new servers in\na moment's notice, very rapid.\n\n557\n00:26:18.218 --> 00:26:21.965\nYou can pre-build images that already\nhave your software configured and you can\n\n558\n00:26:21.965 --> 00:26:25.769\nroll things into production in a matter\nof seconds, that's the rapid deployment\n\n559\n00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:29.210\nthat we get and then the last term that\nwe need to be aware of is automation.\n\n560\n00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:33.781\nAutomation is where we take any kind of\nactivity like scaling up or scaling down,\n\n561\n00:26:33.781 --> 00:26:35.338\nscaling out or scaling in.\n\n562\n00:26:35.338 --> 00:26:37.996\nThose type of activities,\nwe can automate them.\n\n563\n00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:41.104\nWe can set it to where your\nsystem monitors CP utilization or\n\n564\n00:26:41.104 --> 00:26:42.234\nhits on the website.\n\n565\n00:26:42.234 --> 00:26:45.709\nAnd when it exceeds a certain amount, then\nit scales up or then it scales down or\n\n566\n00:26:45.709 --> 00:26:47.147\nthen it scales out or scales in.\n\n567\n00:26:47.147 --> 00:26:50.909\nIt does something to make it where\nthat traffic table can be handled and\n\n568\n00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:54.055\nit can all be automatic, so\nwe don't have worry about it.\n\n569\n00:26:54.055 --> 00:26:56.549\nIt just happens and\nit's done, that's automation.\n\n570\n00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:58.511\nI know we talked about it\na bit in the last episode.\n\n571\n00:26:58.511 --> 00:26:59.707\n>> Excellent stuff, Don.\n\n572\n00:26:59.707 --> 00:27:01.749\nWell, we've covered a lot\nof different terms and\n\n573\n00:27:01.749 --> 00:27:03.410\nwe covered a lot of different concepts.\n\n574\n00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:07.294\nBut hopefully now, you are able to\njump into a conversation about cloud\n\n575\n00:27:07.294 --> 00:27:11.385\nenvironments and you're fully well\naware of every piece of terminology.\n\n576\n00:27:11.385 --> 00:27:14.728\nYou can have those conversations,\nbecause you're up on the language.\n\n577\n00:27:14.728 --> 00:27:17.035\nDon, thank you so much for\nexplaining it to us and\n\n578\n00:27:17.035 --> 00:27:20.765\ngiving us the keys to this little kingdom\nhere and being able to take part in it.\n\n579\n00:27:20.765 --> 00:27:21.683\nWe appreciate that.\n\n580\n00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:23.483\nWe appreciate our viewers for\njoining us today.\n\n581\n00:27:23.483 --> 00:27:25.528\nWe're gonna go and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n582\n00:27:25.528 --> 00:27:26.847\nI've been your host, Daniel

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.165\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:21.753\nin today's episode we're moving\non with our Cloud Plus content.\n\n5\n00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:23.565\nOur series that we've been working so\nhard on.\n\n6\n00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:27.381\nJoining us in the studio today is our good\nfriend, our mentor, our leader, that is,\n\n7\n00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:27.918\nDon Pizet.\n\n8\n00:00:27.918 --> 00:00:29.254\nDon, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n9\n00:00:29.254 --> 00:00:31.110\n>> Thanks for\nhaving me back on the show, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.011\nI'm ready to jump right back\ninto the world of Cloud Plus.\n\n11\n00:00:33.011 --> 00:00:37.481\nIn this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at storage object concepts,\n\n12\n00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:39.290\nwhich is kind of a weird name.\n\n13\n00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.681\nBut it's important to have a good\nunderstanding before you dive into\n\n14\n00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:46.714\nthe world of virtualization, before you\ndive into the world of cloud computing,\n\n15\n00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:48.072\non how storage is handled.\n\n16\n00:00:48.072 --> 00:00:50.300\nBecause it's different\nthan what we're used to.\n\n17\n00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.621\nIn traditional virtualization\nenvironments, or in traditional\n\n18\n00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:58.750\nphysical environments, you have dedicated\nhard drives assigned to virtual machines.\n\n19\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.940\nBut, or to physical machines,\nI guess, but to virtual machines,\n\n20\n00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.300\nyou could have physical drives, but\nyou normally have virtual drives.\n\n21\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.330\nAnd the virtual drives are designed to\nbe portable, to move between systems.\n\n22\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.800\nAnd that means they have to be stored\ndifferently than what we're used to.\n\n23\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.150\nAnd so\nwe're gonna take a look at how that is,\n\n24\n00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.502\nthe different concepts around storage,\nbefore we jump into the bigger world of\n\n25\n00:01:19.502 --> 00:01:22.238\nvirtualization which is coming\nup in the next couple episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:22.238 --> 00:01:25.470\nBecause if you make a mistake on\nhow your storage is set up, and\n\n27\n00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.360\nthen you build your whole infrastructure\non top of it, it's pretty hard to fix.\n\n28\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.643\nSo, you wanna make sure you got a good\nunderstanding of this from early on.\n\n29\n00:01:31.643 --> 00:01:34.140\nAnd we'll see some of that,\nright here today.\n\n30\n00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.700\n>> I know this can definitely\nbe scary topic for most of us,\n\n31\n00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.580\nto be honest with you.\n\n32\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.230\nEven traditional storage concepts are very\nfrightful in the way cuz, well like Don\n\n33\n00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.780\nsaid, if you do them wrong then you've\ngot a lot of backpedaling to do.\n\n34\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.540\nAnd could take you a lot of time,\na lot of effort to make it work correctly.\n\n35\n00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.440\nSo we wanna make sure that you have the\nproper foundation, get the right storage,\n\n36\n00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.230\nand understand the concepts\nbehind storage in the cloud so\n\n37\n00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.990\nthat you can move forward amicably.\n\n38\n00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.444\nSo Don, that leads us to,\n\n39\n00:01:59.444 --> 00:02:03.291\nI guess you say it's different\nthan traditional storage concepts.\n\n40\n00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.060\nSo let's start there.\n\n41\n00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.160\nWhat is different about it?\n\n42\n00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.296\n>> All right, so one of they key things\nto remember with virtualization is that\n\n43\n00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:12.873\ninstead of having dedicated physical hard\ndrives, you've got virtual hard drives.\n\n44\n00:02:12.873 --> 00:02:15.954\nAnd those virtual hard drives\nare gonna be put on real storage,\n\n45\n00:02:15.954 --> 00:02:19.630\nphysical storage, that's typically\nshared with other people, right?\n\n46\n00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.890\nIt's not exclusive to you.\n\n47\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.750\nIf it's a private cloud,\nif it's your own cloud,\n\n48\n00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.920\nthen the hardware is exclusive to you, but\nit's multiple virtual machines sharing it.\n\n49\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.890\nIf it's a public cloud, like Amazon,\nor Azure, or somebody like that,\n\n50\n00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.020\nwell, in that case, it's shared with\nother people that you don't even know.\n\n51\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.920\nAnd it all kind of stems back\nfrom cluster-based storage.\n\n52\n00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.520\nWhen you have virtualization, it's real\nimportant that you have shared storage.\n\n53\n00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.968\nAnd if you've never worked with that\nbefore, let me show you a little\n\n54\n00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:51.310\ndiagram here that I worked up that\nbasically shows how this works.\n\n55\n00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.186\nNow, normally in a non-type SAN\nenvironment whatever if you have just\n\n56\n00:02:55.186 --> 00:02:58.749\nregular physical servers you\nhave something like this, right.\n\n57\n00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.420\nI'm gonna have three servers and\nthey each have their own storage, right.\n\n58\n00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.630\nSo Server 1 might have a couple\nof hard drives, Server 2,\n\n59\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.198\nServer 3 each with their own hard drives.\n\n60\n00:03:07.198 --> 00:03:10.370\nMaybe they've got one set of hard\ndrives for their operating system and\n\n61\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.630\nanother set of hard drives for\ntheir data, right?\n\n62\n00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.195\nSo if I'm a database server I might have\nmy operating system on one drive and\n\n63\n00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:18.452\nthe database on another.\n\n64\n00:03:18.452 --> 00:03:20.740\nIf I'm an email server, same thing.\n\n65\n00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.960\nOperating system on one,\nmailbox database on the other.\n\n66\n00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.470\nIf I'm a domain controller or whatever,\neach server has their own storage needs.\n\n67\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.690\nThe problem here is if I have some\nkind of failure on this server,\n\n68\n00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.930\nI can't just jump it's role\nright over to another server.\n\n69\n00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.660\nBecause all the storage is\nback on that first server.\n\n70\n00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.430\nSo when we build up a virtual machine,\nwe have that same situation.\n\n71\n00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.100\nYou've got the virtual server and\nit's virtual hard drives.\n\n72\n00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.674\nAnd if I ever want that virtual\nserver to move from one piece\n\n73\n00:03:49.674 --> 00:03:53.450\nof hardware to another, it's gotta be\nable to take the storage along with it.\n\n74\n00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.440\nAnd the easiest way to achieve\nthat is through the use of\n\n75\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.060\na Storage Area Network or a SAN.\n\n76\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.320\nAnd the way a SAN works is you take\nthe hard drives out of the servers and\n\n77\n00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.140\nyou put them into some kind of\nshared infrastructure which is that\n\n78\n00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.480\nStorage Area Network, this guy down here.\n\n79\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.512\nAnd there's any number of\ncompanies that make SANs, right?\n\n80\n00:04:12.512 --> 00:04:15.030\nEMC is probably the biggest one.\n\n81\n00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.236\nThey're heavily partnered with Dell and\n\n82\n00:04:16.236 --> 00:04:17.448\nthey sell a ton of SANs\nthat are out there.\n\n83\n00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:20.745\nHP has some huge storage\nproducts that are out there.\n\n84\n00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:23.985\nAnd then there's a lot of other\ncompanies that are in that space too.\n\n85\n00:04:23.985 --> 00:04:27.025\nBut they all basically work the same.\n\n86\n00:04:27.025 --> 00:04:31.033\nWhat they all do is they allow you to\ntake a bunch of physical hard drives.\n\n87\n00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:33.354\nAnd we might be talking about\n3 physical hard drives,\n\n88\n00:04:33.354 --> 00:04:37.093\nwe might be talking about 100, 200,\n500, 1,000 hard drives, right?\n\n89\n00:04:37.093 --> 00:04:38.532\nIt can be a lot.\n\n90\n00:04:38.532 --> 00:04:42.504\nAnd then all of your servers\nconnect to that SAN.\n\n91\n00:04:42.504 --> 00:04:45.850\nAnd your servers,\nI'm talking about your physical servers.\n\n92\n00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.960\nThey may have their own hard drives, and\n\n93\n00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.225\nthey may not even have\na hard drive at all.\n\n94\n00:04:49.225 --> 00:04:52.290\n100% of your hard drives\ncould reside in the SAN.\n\n95\n00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.580\nAnd when your physical servers boot up,\nthey could be booting off of the SAN.\n\n96\n00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.775\nBut let's just assume for\n\n97\n00:04:57.775 --> 00:05:01.258\na moment that each of these physical\nservers has mirrored hard drives in it.\n\n98\n00:05:01.258 --> 00:05:03.652\nRight, so it's just a RAID 1.\n\n99\n00:05:03.652 --> 00:05:06.937\nThey've got mirrored storage and that's\nwhere their operating system resides.\n\n100\n00:05:06.937 --> 00:05:12.836\nAnd then maybe these are VMWare VSphere\nservers, right, so they're running ESXi.\n\n101\n00:05:12.836 --> 00:05:16.986\nOr maybe they are Microsoft Hyper-V\nservers, or Citrix XenServers,\n\n102\n00:05:16.986 --> 00:05:22.820\nthey're Linux boxes running KVM, but\nthere's some kind of virtualization host.\n\n103\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.950\nAnd on these,\nthey're running virtual machines.\n\n104\n00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.882\nSo I might have five virtual web\nservers running on Server 1, and\n\n105\n00:05:28.882 --> 00:05:31.406\nanother five virtual web\nservers running on Server 2.\n\n106\n00:05:31.406 --> 00:05:34.650\nAnd I might have some virtual\ndatabase servers running on Server 3.\n\n107\n00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.250\nWell those virtual machines that are up\nand running, they need storage too.\n\n108\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.372\nAnd the storage is getting\nplaced down on the SAN.\n\n109\n00:05:43.372 --> 00:05:46.774\nNot on these local drives but on the SAN.\n\n110\n00:05:46.774 --> 00:05:50.485\nAnd the reason we do that is if\nthis physical server were to die,\n\n111\n00:05:50.485 --> 00:05:55.260\nif Server 3 were to fail, just outright\nit dies, it's off the network, okay.\n\n112\n00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.951\nWell when that happens,\n\n113\n00:05:56.951 --> 00:06:02.110\nI can bring the virtual machine up over\nhere on Server 2 or over on Server 1.\n\n114\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.673\nAnd I don't have to worry about\nmoving storage because Server 2 and\n\n115\n00:06:05.673 --> 00:06:09.310\nServer 1 both have access to the SAN,\nand they can see that storage.\n\n116\n00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.180\nAnd they can immediately boot it back up,\nand off we go.\n\n117\n00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.400\nSo you have shared storage.\n\n118\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.310\nNot storage exclusive to a single,\nphysical server, but\n\n119\n00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.420\nstorage shared across\nmultiple physical servers.\n\n120\n00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.077\nAnd so when you bring up your private\ncloud with Hyper-V or VMware,\n\n121\n00:06:24.077 --> 00:06:28.183\nwhen you go into Amazon Web Services or\nMicrosoft Azure, when you go to those\n\n122\n00:06:28.183 --> 00:06:32.692\ncloud services what you're effectively\ndoing is adopting this model right here.\n\n123\n00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:34.190\nYou see virtual machines.\n\n124\n00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.600\nThat's who you deal with.\n\n125\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.340\nBut on the backend, on the hardware end,\n\n126\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.060\nthere's a storage area network\nwith this net shared storage.\n\n127\n00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.750\nNow that SAN becomes a critical\npiece of the network, right?\n\n128\n00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.650\nThat if it goes offline, what happens\nto all my virtual machines up here?\n\n129\n00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.310\nThey all go offline,\neverything could die all at the same time.\n\n130\n00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.927\nSo these are usually heavily redundant,\nvery expensive and\n\n131\n00:06:56.927 --> 00:07:02.187\njust very, very well built and\nwell designed or crafted solutions.\n\n132\n00:07:02.187 --> 00:07:03.338\nBecause they do need to be up.\n\n133\n00:07:03.338 --> 00:07:07.552\nSo they usually have redundant controllers\nin them and redundant network cards,\n\n134\n00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.660\nmany, many extra hard drives.\n\n135\n00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.940\nYou may even have more than one SAN.\n\n136\n00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:17.090\nIf you start uploading your VMs into\nMicrosoft Azure, they guarantee\n\n137\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.960\nthree copies of your data on three\ncompletely separate storage area networks.\n\n138\n00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.450\nAWS, you can do the same thing.\n\n139\n00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.320\nAnd you can set up geo-replication, where\nyour data is not just stored here on a SAN\n\n140\n00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.250\nin the US, but maybe on a SAN in Europe or\nAustralia or somewhere like that.\n\n141\n00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.874\nYou can actually setup geo-replication\nwith this stuff and it's really,\n\n142\n00:07:33.874 --> 00:07:34.530\nreally powerful.\n\n143\n00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.350\nBut, the key thing to remember\nis that the SAN is very busy.\n\n144\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.750\nThe more servers attached to it,\nthe more activities going on on the SAN.\n\n145\n00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.793\nSo they have to be highly tuned and\nhighly optimized to manage your data.\n\n146\n00:07:46.793 --> 00:07:51.475\nAnd the way they do that is by handling\ndata a little differently than what\n\n147\n00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:52.566\nwe're used to.\n\n148\n00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:55.390\nSo let's say you have a drive\nthat's formatted FAT32.\n\n149\n00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.108\nThat's File Allocation Table.\n\n150\n00:07:57.108 --> 00:07:59.169\nThere's a table in\nthe center of that drive.\n\n151\n00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:01.749\nAnd when I wanna find a file\nI go to the table first and\n\n152\n00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:03.984\nI say hey here's the file I'm looking for.\n\n153\n00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:08.587\nAnd in that table it tells me where on\nthe hard drive to go and find that data,\n\n154\n00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:09.290\nright?\n\n155\n00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.450\nSo I know a physical location on the drive\nthat I can then jump to and find it.\n\n156\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.040\nAnd that works, it's worked for\nyears and years and years.\n\n157\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.820\nAnd on traditional drives where you\nhave that arm with a magnetic reader and\n\n158\n00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.330\nwriter, the arm has to move to\nthe location, read the data,\n\n159\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.370\nand then return it back to me.\n\n160\n00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.740\nIf there's a lot of people\ntrying to do that all at once,\n\n161\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.300\nthe arm can't be in more than one place\nat a time, and that slows things down.\n\n162\n00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.600\nNow most cloud providers have gone to\nsolid state digital drives, or SSDs.\n\n163\n00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.840\nSo that whole arm moving thing\nisn't a big deal anymore.\n\n164\n00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.380\nThe seek time goes away.\n\n165\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.170\nBut we have another problem, which is\nwhen you look at your virtual hard drive\n\n166\n00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:46.140\nit can't have a pointer to\na physical location on the disk.\n\n167\n00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.710\nIt has a pointer to a location\nin the virtual disk.\n\n168\n00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.120\nAnd then whatever virtualization software\nyou're using has to take that hard drive\n\n169\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.150\ncall and then turn around and look to\nthe physical drive and do that look up.\n\n170\n00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.210\nSo you end up with two look ups\noccurring that slows things down.\n\n171\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.490\nWell, in a test or\ndev environment we don't care about that.\n\n172\n00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.620\nIt's no big deal.\n\n173\n00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.850\nBut in a production environment we\nneed those look-ups to happen as\n\n174\n00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.680\nfast as possible.\n\n175\n00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.460\nSo when you're using cloud storage,\nwhen you're using Amazon Web Services,\n\n176\n00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.510\nMicrosoft Azure, if you're using VMware,\nvSphere, or even Hyper-V, when\n\n177\n00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.630\nit starts creating these virtual disks and\nthrowing them onto the hard drive,\n\n178\n00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:28.750\nwhat it's actually going to do is start to\nuse a database to store the data instead.\n\n179\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.040\nAnd actually, a hyper V its default\nconfiguration doesn't do it.\n\n180\n00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.730\nBut it can be configured to do it.\n\n181\n00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.420\nLet's see.\n\n182\n00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.490\nWho uses it all by default?\n\n183\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.820\nI know VMware uses it by default.\n\n184\n00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.840\nCitrix Xenserver uses it by default.\n\n185\n00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.120\nThe cloud providers all do.\n\n186\n00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.030\nMicrosoft Azure and MWS.\n\n187\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.020\nWhere your data's actually\nbeing stored in the database.\n\n188\n00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.470\nBut what does a database normally store?\n\n189\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.720\nWell, it might have an employee directory.\n\n190\n00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.110\nSo user's first name,\nlast name, phone number.\n\n191\n00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.840\nAnd I can query, hey,\nwhat's Daniel Lowry's phone number.\n\n192\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.940\nI query the database, I get a result.\n\n193\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.140\nCan I store an entire virtual\nhard drive in a database?\n\n194\n00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.330\nNot normally.\n\n195\n00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.420\nSo they had to create specially tuned\ndatabases that were designed just to\n\n196\n00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.230\nhandle this.\n\n197\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.400\nSo that now when you go to look up for\na file, you're not looking for a physical\n\n198\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.750\nlocation on a hard drive, you're just\nlooking for a record from a database.\n\n199\n00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.280\nAnd all those records can be indexed and\nthe indexes can be stored in RAM so\n\n200\n00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.360\nthese lookups happen very, very quickly.\n\n201\n00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.890\nAnd it requires the use of something that\nmost of us probably having worked with,\n\n202\n00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.400\nit's called a blob.\n\n203\n00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.080\nAnd a blob it originally didn't stand for\nanything, it was just a blob\n\n204\n00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.490\nthat you would take your data, this raw\ndata and dump it into the database.\n\n205\n00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.180\nIt's a blob of data and then somebody\ncould query it and return the data.\n\n206\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.760\nAnd in the earlier days\nthey were using it for\n\n207\n00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.440\nthings like, what was that crappy\nmap website that Microsoft had?\n\n208\n00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.350\nDo you remember?\n\n209\n00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.520\nNot Expedia, but map-\n>> MapQuest?\n\n210\n00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.740\n>> MapQuest.\nDo you remember that one?\n\n211\n00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.291\n>> Yeah, I do.\n\n212\n00:10:49.291 --> 00:10:50.523\n[LAUGH]\n>> Probably still around.\n\n213\n00:10:50.523 --> 00:10:52.283\nIf you work for MapQuest,\nsorry I called it crappy.\n\n214\n00:10:52.283 --> 00:10:53.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n215\n00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.920\nthe way it would work is you\ncould punch in latitude and\n\n216\n00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.750\nlongitude\n>> And we query the database, and\n\n217\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.490\nit would find the map plat, the image,\nfor that latitude and longitude.\n\n218\n00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.790\nAnd it was just a blob of data.\n\n219\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:06.620\nAnd the database would return it to you,\nand you'd interpret it as a picture.\n\n220\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.930\nThe trick there was the database\nhad no idea it was a picture.\n\n221\n00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.280\nIt just knew it was a blob of binary data.\n\n222\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.220\nAnd so when you went and queried it,\nit would say you're looking for\n\n223\n00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.460\nthis latitude and longitude.\n\n224\n00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.630\nHere's a bunch of junk I have on that.\n\n225\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.220\nAnd then it was up to you to deal with it.\n\n226\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.990\nAnd by doing it that way,\nit made it very fast.\n\n227\n00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.240\nAnd as crummy as MapQuest was or\n\n228\n00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.950\nis, nobody ever complained\nabout it being slow.\n\n229\n00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.720\nIt was very fast.\n\n230\n00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.150\nIt returned that data very, very quickly\ncuz the database model worked really well.\n\n231\n00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.910\nWell, they adopted that to\nuse with virtual machines.\n\n232\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.820\nLet me show you it in action,\ncuz it can make a little more sense.\n\n233\n00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.490\nI'm gonna jump over to,\nwho do I wanna use today?\n\n234\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:45.210\nWe'll use Azure for this one,\ncuz Azure makes it really easy to see it.\n\n235\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.750\nSo I'm gonna go into Microsoft Azure,\nMicrosoft's cloud virtualization platform,\n\n236\n00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.095\nand I'm gonna create\na new virtual machine.\n\n237\n00:11:52.095 --> 00:11:56.285\nSo I'm gonna just jump into my virtual\nmachines here, and I'm gonna create\n\n238\n00:11:56.285 --> 00:12:01.210\na classic mode just because it's, again,\nit's easier to see what I wanna see.\n\n239\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.580\nSo, I'm gonna whip up a Window\nserver 2012 R2 Data Center machine.\n\n240\n00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.522\n>> Fancy.\n>> I know.\n\n241\n00:12:06.522 --> 00:12:08.620\nWhy go any less?\n\n242\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.620\nSo, I'm gonna go and\ncreate this virtual machine and\n\n243\n00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.930\nI'm gonna do it in classic mode.\n\n244\n00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.520\nWe'll create that.\n\n245\n00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.480\nAnd when I go to create the virtual\nmachine it's gonna ask me some stuff,\n\n246\n00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.140\nright, I need a host name, so\nmaybe this is gonna be a web server,\n\n247\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.670\nI'll call it itprotv-web02 which\nI don't think I've used yet.\n\n248\n00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.860\nI'll create a user account for myself\non the machine so I can login to it,\n\n249\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.410\nthat's always a handy\nthing to be able to do.\n\n250\n00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:30.349\nI'll pick my pricing tier.\n\n251\n00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:34.170\nI'm gonna stick with the standard\nnetwork storage and diagnostic.\n\n252\n00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.800\nNow I do want to pay attention to\nthis one, so I'm gonna click on it.\n\n253\n00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.850\nAnd over here it's gonna ask\nme about my storage account.\n\n254\n00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.660\nAnd I don't currently have a storage\naccount that I'm aware of, so\n\n255\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.180\nit's gonna create a new one for\nme called itprotvwe.\n\n256\n00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.510\nRight, so just the first, what is that,\n\n257\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.780\nlike the first eight characters or\nsomething.\n\n258\n00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.700\nSo I need to remember that,\n\n259\n00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.030\ncuz that's gonna be where my actual\nvirtual hard drive is gonna get stored.\n\n260\n00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.310\nThat guy right there.\n\n261\n00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.770\nAll right, so\nstick that in the back of my mind.\n\n262\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.450\nAnd once I've got that, there it is.\n\n263\n00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.020\nI was wondering why it wouldn't\nlet me change the name.\n\n264\n00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.630\nHere we can change the name to\nsomething a little more useful.\n\n265\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:13.830\nSo I'll just call this like\nITProTV-demostorage so I can remember it.\n\n266\n00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:14.500\nIt doesn't like that.\n\n267\n00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.430\nThat's right, it doesn't like long names.\n\n268\n00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.970\nIt like holds you to 15 characters or\nsomething.\n\n269\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.680\nSo I'll just call it itprotvdemo,\nthere we go.\n\n270\n00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.590\nSo that's gonna be the storage\nthat I use for this one.\n\n271\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.380\nPerfect.\n\n272\n00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.320\nAlright then I can specify my other\nconfiguration, I'm just gonna leave it\n\n273\n00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.910\nall the defaults, I don't really\nneed to change any of this stuff.\n\n274\n00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.570\nI'll go ahead and say okay and it's gonna\nspin up that virtual machine for me.\n\n275\n00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:42.419\nSo, it's gonna create a virtual machine\nrunning Windows Server 2012 R2.\n\n276\n00:13:42.419 --> 00:13:44.890\nAnd that virtual machine\nis gonna have a hard drive.\n\n277\n00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.900\nAnd I didn't change any defaults or\nanything here so\n\n278\n00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.990\nit should just be\nthe default hard drive size,\n\n279\n00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.300\nwhich if I remember right is\nI think 50 mega gigabytes.\n\n280\n00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.770\nSo I think it's 50 gigs, but\nwe'll see when it's done.\n\n281\n00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:56.980\nBut it's gonna create a hard drive, and\n\n282\n00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.840\nhard drive's gonna have the Windows\noperating system on it.\n\n283\n00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.100\nIt's gonna have all the other\nstuff that's inside of it.\n\n284\n00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.000\nAnd the virtual machine is\ngonna see it as a hard drive.\n\n285\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:08.740\nBut in Azure, it's actually being\nstored in the database on the back end.\n\n286\n00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.790\nAnd Microsoft calls those\ndatabases storage accounts.\n\n287\n00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.940\nAnd so\nif I look over here on the left side,\n\n288\n00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.870\nI see a storage account and if I go into\nmy storage accounts Well in a moment\n\n289\n00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.340\nI'll see a new one appear called ITProTV\ndemo cuz that's what I chose to name it.\n\n290\n00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.180\nAnd if I sit here and\n\n291\n00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.730\nhit refresh, it didn't take nearly\nas long as I thought it would.\n\n292\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:31.480\nSo there's the itprotvdemo storage\naccount, which again is really a database.\n\n293\n00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.050\nAnd when I go into that itprotvdemo and\n\n294\n00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:38.000\nI start to look at what's inside of it,\nlook at what's inside of it.\n\n295\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.350\nBlobs, Files, Tables, and Queues.\n\n296\n00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.860\nAll right.\n\n297\n00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.490\nNow each one of these\nhas a different purpose.\n\n298\n00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:46.170\nIf you watch our Azure show we\ncover files, tables, and queues but\n\n299\n00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.030\nthe one I care about are blobs.\n\n300\n00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.020\nThe virtual hard drive from\nmy VM that I just created,\n\n301\n00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.620\nitprotvweb02, is being stored as a blob.\n\n302\n00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.830\nAnd notice that it's not an acronym.\n\n303\n00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.450\nA lot of people say it's an acronym.\n\n304\n00:14:58.450 --> 00:14:59.280\nIt stands for something.\n\n305\n00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.580\nIt really doesn't stand for anything.\n\n306\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.160\nIt's just blobs.\n\n307\n00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.750\nBut you'll hear some people call it\na basic, shoot, what do they say?\n\n308\n00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.000\n>> A binary large object?\n\n309\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.570\nYou'll hear basic large object and\nbinary large object.\n\n310\n00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.300\nBoth of those are just acronyms people\nhave made up after the fact, but they were\n\n311\n00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.990\noriginally just called Blobs, that's all\nthey are so it doesn't stand for anything.\n\n312\n00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:25.240\nBut when you go into it we can start to\nsee the data that's inside of the blob.\n\n313\n00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.610\nAnd if I look I've got appeared to be\nfolders, and these really aren't folders,\n\n314\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:30.950\nthey are just tags.\n\n315\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.620\nData that is being put in this\ndatabase has certain tags,\n\n316\n00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.240\nsome of it is tagged as boot diagnostics.\n\n317\n00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.771\nSome of it is tagged as a VHD,\nas a virtual hard drive.\n\n318\n00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:44.703\nIf I go into the virtual hard drives I\ncan see where I've got a page blob and\n\n319\n00:15:44.703 --> 00:15:49.273\na block blob of my VHD's of\nthose virtual hard drives and\n\n320\n00:15:49.273 --> 00:15:53.768\nif I take a look at those,\nsay a one is zero bytes right?\n\n321\n00:15:53.768 --> 00:15:57.455\nThis one is use as status file like a\nheartbeat that the system is tracking that\n\n322\n00:15:57.455 --> 00:15:59.227\nmake sure the virtual machine is on.\n\n323\n00:15:59.227 --> 00:16:01.448\nBut the other one is 127 gigabytes,\n\n324\n00:16:01.448 --> 00:16:04.350\napparently that's the default,\nI was way wrong.\n\n325\n00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:09.170\nSo 127 gigs there is the actual virtual\nhard drive and it's a page blob.\n\n326\n00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.120\nEvery bit of data that I write to that\nhard drive is actually being stored in\n\n327\n00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.500\nthis database.\n\n328\n00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.290\nSo why do it this way?\n\n329\n00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.430\nWhy make it hard?\n\n330\n00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.910\nWell, it's performance.\n\n331\n00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.590\nIt's all about performance.\n\n332\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.800\nWhen I go to read from the hard drive,\ninstead of having to view various hardware\n\n333\n00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.980\nlookups, it can do a query\nagainst the database.\n\n334\n00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.340\nAnd if my hard drive has to be moved,\nif the SAN dies and\n\n335\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.690\nmy data has to be moved to another SAN,\nif I've been replicated somewhere else,\n\n336\n00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.800\nall it has to do is update the index\nto point to the new location.\n\n337\n00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.520\nAnd it's done.\n\n338\n00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.270\nThe virtual machine doesn't even realize\nit's going to different hardware anymore.\n\n339\n00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.860\nIt happens automatically on the back end.\n\n340\n00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.910\nAnd thousands of other customers\ncan be hitting this same database,\n\n341\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.140\nthis same physical server or whatever.\n\n342\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.820\nAnd they're able to find their data very\nquickly without contending against other\n\n343\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.690\npeople, right.\n\n344\n00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.770\nWe're not all fighting for\naccess to the same file allocation table.\n\n345\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.100\nWe're all querying our own\nindependent databases.\n\n346\n00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.670\nAnd then on the back end, it's\nconverting that into hardware reads and\n\n347\n00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.540\nsending those to the right locations.\n\n348\n00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.850\nSo it's really all about performance,\nand that's called a blob.\n\n349\n00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:10.120\nAnd the blob is just that binary data\n\n350\n00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.900\nbeing chucked into a database\nwhere we can retrieve it.\n\n351\n00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.210\nFor a regular workstation, for\nservers that have dedicated hard drives,\n\n352\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:16.880\nwe don't need that.\n\n353\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.690\nWe have dedicated access.\n\n354\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.644\nBut with shared access,\nit's very important, and so\n\n355\n00:17:20.644 --> 00:17:22.900\nit's important that we\nunderstand that concept.\n\n356\n00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.820\nWhen you store the data,\nyour virtual platform,\n\n357\n00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.190\na lot of times,\nhas no idea what the data is.\n\n358\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.960\nIt doesn't know that this is a VHT,\nit's tagged as a VHT, but\n\n359\n00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.140\nto it, it's just a bunch of binary data.\n\n360\n00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.880\nA bunch of ones and zeros all strung\nin a big fat line, and that's it.\n\n361\n00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.380\nAnd if I query against it, that's exactly\nwhat I'm going to get back is a bunch of\n\n362\n00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.950\nones and zeros and\nI've got to make sense of it.\n\n363\n00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.760\nThe virtualization software does that.\n\n364\n00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.060\n>> Now Don, obviously if our data is\nbeing stored as blobs in this virtual\n\n365\n00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.620\nenvironment, there's got to be some way to\ndifferentiate my blobs from your blobs or\n\n366\n00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.300\nthe system's going to get\na little haywire, and\n\n367\n00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.800\nwe're not going to have\nvery good optimization.\n\n368\n00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.210\nSo how do they do that,\nhow do they say this is Don's blobs and\n\n369\n00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.280\nthis is Dan's blobs?\n\n370\n00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.650\n>> All right, so I mentioned tags, and\ntags is just a generic term that I use,\n\n371\n00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.310\nbut when I went in here,\nremember I said it doesn't even\n\n372\n00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.730\nnecessarily know that these\nare virtual hard drives, right?\n\n373\n00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.070\nAnd it does, Microsoft wrote all this up,\n\n374\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.000\nthey know that, but\nreally the database doesn't truly care.\n\n375\n00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.240\nI could put pictures here, Word documents,\nyou could put whatever you want.\n\n376\n00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.240\nBut it's expecting virtual hard drives.\n\n377\n00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.290\nBut over here, if I go back a screen.\n\n378\n00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.760\nRemember I said some were tagged as\nVHDs which are virtual hard drives.\n\n379\n00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.470\nSome more tags are boot diagnostics.\n\n380\n00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.030\nThose tags,\nthat's really considered metadata.\n\n381\n00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.490\nWhen you store data in the database,\nwe need metadata attached to it.\n\n382\n00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:40.000\nThink of like, music files,\nmp3 files, right.\n\n383\n00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.710\nIf I send you an mp3 file of me\nsinging whatever, it's just bad,\n\n384\n00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.040\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n385\n00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.920\nSo I send you a copy of me\nsinging Crazy Train, right.\n\n386\n00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.810\nAnd how do you know\nthat that's what it is?\n\n387\n00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:53.320\nWell, you don't.\n\n388\n00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.800\nYou just have an mp3 file and\n\n389\n00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.190\nmaybe the file name is named in such\na way that you know what it is.\n\n390\n00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.460\nAnd it says, Don's singing,\ndon't listen ever, right?\n\n391\n00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.230\nDot mp3.\n\n392\n00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:06.565\nSo by the file name you know,\nhey it's Don singing and\n\n393\n00:19:06.565 --> 00:19:09.410\n.mp3, it's a music file, right?\n\n394\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.600\nBased on the file name but\n\n395\n00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.040\nwhat if I change the file name to 1234 and\nthat's it?\n\n396\n00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.694\nNow you don't know what the file is,\nyou don't know what kind of file it is,\n\n397\n00:19:17.694 --> 00:19:19.643\nyou don't know if it's music or\ndocument or whatever,\n\n398\n00:19:19.643 --> 00:19:21.400\nbecause the name doesn't indicate it.\n\n399\n00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.470\nSo using that file name is\none way to identify it.\n\n400\n00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.580\nBut when we store data in a blob,\nwe don't have a file name.\n\n401\n00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.570\nNo file name exists.\n\n402\n00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.100\nSo we need metadata to\nidentify what that is.\n\n403\n00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.240\nAnd a great way to see that,\nI'm going to jump over to AWS.\n\n404\n00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.680\nAnd if you're wondering why I pick\nAzure for some things and AWS for\n\n405\n00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.750\nothers, mostly it boils down to this.\n\n406\n00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:46.840\nOn the show, there are some things that\nare much easier to see in Azure versus\n\n407\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.050\nAWS or so on, so Microsoft is really\ntransparent about showing you the blobs,\n\n408\n00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.380\nwhereas Amazon hides all of that.\n\n409\n00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.840\nSo I can't see it in the GUI.\n\n410\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.840\nAmazon is really good about\nshowing you the metadata,\n\n411\n00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.110\nwhereas Microsoft hides all that.\n\n412\n00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.700\nSo that's why I'm flipping between these.\n\n413\n00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.680\nIn real life,\nboth services perform about the same.\n\n414\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.970\nSo you're welcome to use either one.\n\n415\n00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.700\nBut in Amazon we have what's\ncalled the scalable, well S3,\n\n416\n00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.360\nwhich is simple storage.\n\n417\n00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.520\nAnd the simple storage solution I\nthink is the full, why it's S3.\n\n418\n00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.510\nBut when you go into S3, you can store\ndata up here in the cloud, and it's\n\n419\n00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.630\nvirtual storage, just like what we saw\nwith our virtual hard drives a moment ago.\n\n420\n00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:25.190\nAnd you'll see that I've got what\nare called buckets created, and\n\n421\n00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.480\nI've got a bucket called itprotv-demo.\n\n422\n00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.770\nSo this is storage that's up in the cloud.\n\n423\n00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.105\nAnd you'll see where I've got a couple\nof files, heartbeat.php file,\n\n424\n00:20:35.105 --> 00:20:38.690\nindex.html file, pony-grab.png,\nwhich is an image file.\n\n425\n00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.610\nIf you've been watching the show a long\ntime, you'll know it's a terrible picture\n\n426\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.300\nof a horse I drew in an A+ episode,\na couple years ago.\n\n427\n00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.730\nBut I keep it around,\ncause it reminds you of happier times.\n\n428\n00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:49.350\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n429\n00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.286\n>> So, anyhow it shows how bad\n\n430\n00:20:50.286 --> 00:20:51.160\nof an artist I am.\n\n431\n00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.090\nBut these are things I've uploaded.\n\n432\n00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.660\nNow, on AWS, inside of S3,\n\n433\n00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.420\nthey don't actually know if this\nis a picture or a text file.\n\n434\n00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.290\nThey don't know if this is html or php.\n\n435\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.520\nTo them, it's just binary data.\n\n436\n00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.330\nOnes and zeroes.\n\n437\n00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.560\nBut there's a metadata\nattribute called Name.\n\n438\n00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.770\nAnd in that name, it's given it\na name like this, like index.html.\n\n439\n00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:14.620\nOkay?\n\n440\n00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.340\nAnd if I pull up the properties for\nindex.html and\n\n441\n00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:22.320\nI start to look at that, over here,\nsee how it's got that itprotv-demo?\n\n442\n00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.360\nThat's where I parked it.\n\n443\n00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.170\nBut then name, index.html.\n\n444\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.930\nThat name is just an attribute\nthat's tied to it.\n\n445\n00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.490\nThe size, the modification date,\nthe owner,\n\n446\n00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.400\nthe tags, that's all just\nattributes that are assigned to it.\n\n447\n00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.170\nSo going back to that mp3 file example,\nyou can take metadata for\n\n448\n00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:43.750\nthat music and\nembed it inside of the file.\n\n449\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.640\nSo you could put that\nthe artist was Don Pizet and\n\n450\n00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.320\nthe song title was Don't Listen to\nThis Ever, or Crazy Train, or whatever.\n\n451\n00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.630\nAnd that the type of file was an mp3.\n\n452\n00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.335\nAnd then that way,\neven if somebody renamed the file,\n\n453\n00:21:56.335 --> 00:21:58.570\nyour system would still recognize\nwhat it was and play it.\n\n454\n00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.150\nThe name of the file\ndoesn't actually matter,\n\n455\n00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.150\nthe metadata inside of it does,\nthat's how this is.\n\n456\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.600\nHere's the metadata for this file, and I\ncan see that it's got that name of indexed\n\n457\n00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.200\nthat html, and it's got a link here that I\ncan click on to actually go and view it.\n\n458\n00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.230\nAnd if I click on that, here's the file.\n\n459\n00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.970\nIt's a very simple file that\nrenders as this is a test page.\n\n460\n00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.110\nAnd that's it.\n\n461\n00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.880\nOkay?\nSo I was able to browse into it and\n\n462\n00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.290\nopen it and it knew what that was and\nit showed it to me.\n\n463\n00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.700\nWell, did it actually know what that was?\n\n464\n00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.920\nWell, it actually didn't.\n\n465\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.520\nAll right.\n\n466\n00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.420\nIf you look down here a little bit\nfurther, I've got the metadata for\n\n467\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.510\nthat file.\n\n468\n00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:37.213\nAnd if I expand that out, I've only\ngot one metadata value right now.\n\n469\n00:22:37.213 --> 00:22:38.695\nContent-Type.\n\n470\n00:22:38.695 --> 00:22:43.150\nAnd under Content-Type it's got text/html.\n\n471\n00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:47.060\nIt's storing this metadata so that when\nI access the file, it told me, hey, Don.\n\n472\n00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.530\nI'm about to give you a file.\n\n473\n00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.580\nAnd it's html just so you know, okay.\n\n474\n00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.920\nBut, what if I changed that?\n\n475\n00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.540\nI'm gonna make it text/plain, okay.\n\n476\n00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.700\nNow, I'm saying that it's just\na plain text file not html, right.\n\n477\n00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.200\nIt's just, just regular old text, right.\n\n478\n00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.317\nSo I'm going to set that and\n\n479\n00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:07.610\nlet me just hit my trusty old\nSave button here to save it.\n\n480\n00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:13.830\nNow, the file still ends in .html and\nyou and I both know that\n\n481\n00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.430\nif a file ends in html then it's hyper\ntext markup language, it's a web page.\n\n482\n00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.130\nBut when I click on it\nnow watch what happens.\n\n483\n00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.520\nShoot.\n\n484\n00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.010\nWatch, it gets cached.\n\n485\n00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.980\nLet me close this out real quick.\n\n486\n00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:31.780\nI might have to open it in Chrome because\nSafari interprets the file no matter what.\n\n487\n00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.880\nBut what'll happen is if I open this in\nChrome or another location like that,\n\n488\n00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.810\nthat what it's going to do is it's going\nto ask AWS what type of file that is.\n\n489\n00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:48.600\nAnd it's going to bring it\nup as a plain text file.\n\n490\n00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.710\nThere we go.\n\n491\n00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.120\nSo I'm going to bring up in Chrome.\n\n492\n00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.491\nChrome is a little more standards\ncompliant then Safari is.\n\n493\n00:23:53.491 --> 00:23:57.140\nAnd so when I browse to it,\nsee how I put that in there,\n\n494\n00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:02.104\ns3.amazonnaws.com/tprotv-demo/index.html\nIt ends in html.\n\n495\n00:24:02.104 --> 00:24:04.948\nIt should be a hypertext\nmarkup language file.\n\n496\n00:24:04.948 --> 00:24:05.940\nBut what do I get?\n\n497\n00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:11.450\nI actually get the raw html display,\nbecause we told it that it was plaintext.\n\n498\n00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.610\nThe file name doesn't actually matter.\n\n499\n00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:16.630\nSo metadata is really important.\n\n500\n00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.710\nAnd when you're creating\nvirtual hard drives in Azure or\n\n501\n00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:24.150\ncreating virtual machines inside\nof VMWare, VMWare Fusion,\n\n502\n00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:28.710\nVMWare ESX, whatever product it is\nthat you're using, Citrix XenServer.\n\n503\n00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.280\nThey're putting your data into a database,\nand\n\n504\n00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.260\nthey're putting extensive metadata on\ntop of it to identify what that it is.\n\n505\n00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.080\nAnd it can even go further and\ndo custom things.\n\n506\n00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.350\nDaniel, your question was,\nhow do we know who this belongs to, right?\n\n507\n00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:48.190\nAnd I think you saw that\nback when I was in Safari,\n\n508\n00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:52.200\nlooking at the metadata you\nactually have an owner right there.\n\n509\n00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.940\nAnd mine's owned by my awsdemo account,\nright?\n\n510\n00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.670\nSo that's one way of doing it.\n\n511\n00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.540\nBut you can create what's\ncalled extended metadata\n\n512\n00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.200\nwhere you can track\nwhatever the heck you want.\n\n513\n00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.890\nRight?\nMaybe your company\n\n514\n00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:09.220\nhas a data retention policy that says data\nhas to be destroyed after seven years.\n\n515\n00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.630\nOkay, so it's really important that\nyou track when your file was created.\n\n516\n00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.049\nNotice up here, I have metadata for\nwhen it was last modified, but not for\n\n517\n00:25:17.049 --> 00:25:18.052\nwhen it was created.\n\n518\n00:25:18.052 --> 00:25:20.454\nAnd if I want it to be\ndestroyed after seven years,\n\n519\n00:25:20.454 --> 00:25:22.320\nI need to track when it was made.\n\n520\n00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:27.460\nSo I might add a custom metadata value\nthat I can call whatever I want, right?\n\n521\n00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.180\nAnd there's pre-built ones.\n\n522\n00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.950\nFor all sorts of different\nthings like expires.\n\n523\n00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.170\nThat's standard metadata\nthat I can play in.\n\n524\n00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:37.420\nSo if I wanna say that it\nexpires seven years from today.\n\n525\n00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.350\nI can't figure out what\nseven years from today is.\n\n526\n00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:41.310\nI don't actually know.\n\n527\n00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:47.130\nBut it gets to be February 9th,\n20 something.\n\n528\n00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.480\nSo 2024.\nHow about that?\n\n529\n00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.270\nSo we'll just go into the future.\n\n530\n00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.440\nI think that's eight years.\n\n531\n00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.600\nBut so now I can set that value,\nand that can be stored.\n\n532\n00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.120\nAnd I've got an expiration date stored for\nthat.\n\n533\n00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.110\nAll right, but you can even go\ncompletely custom if you want, right?\n\n534\n00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:07.380\nI might want to track what virtual\nmachine this should actually tied to.\n\n535\n00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:12.240\nSo I might create one called VM owner or\nsomething like that.\n\n536\n00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.176\nAnd specify this is own by ITPROTV-WEB01.\n\n537\n00:26:15.176 --> 00:26:17.746\nAnd then in the future\nI can run a query and\n\n538\n00:26:17.746 --> 00:26:21.940\nsay give me a list of all files\nthat are tied to ITPROTV-WEB01.\n\n539\n00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.430\nAnd I can query this metadata.\n\n540\n00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:24.390\nThat's extended metadata.\n\n541\n00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.210\nI'm creating custom values myself.\n\n542\n00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.990\nThey can store whatever it is that I need,\nbut there's standard metadata,\n\n543\n00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:33.620\nlike these guys here that\nare pretty much excepted.\n\n544\n00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.210\nWell, not these Amazon ones, but the other\nones are ones that are pretty much\n\n545\n00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.970\nexpected by any system that's out there,\nand you can use those.\n\n546\n00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:42.520\nSo that metadata is really important\nwhen we store the file information\n\n547\n00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.630\ndifferently than how you\nwould on a local machine.\n\n548\n00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.160\nIt's kind of a key concept there.\n\n549\n00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.580\n>> So the standard metadata values,\nthey kind of work across the board.\n\n550\n00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.280\nNo matter what cloud\nsystem you might be using.\n\n551\n00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.740\nYou're gonna see those ubiquitously.\n\n552\n00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.570\n>> Absolutely.\n\n553\n00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:56.800\n>> Awesome.\n\n554\n00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.790\n>> Now, once our data's there in\nthe database we can gain access to it.\n\n555\n00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.900\nWe've got our metadata, so\nwe now know what the data is and\n\n556\n00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.430\nwe can start to work with it.\n\n557\n00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.820\nBut there's a little bit more\nthan we'll normally need to do.\n\n558\n00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.760\nWhen you're dealing with local\nstorage you might also choose to set\n\n559\n00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.920\npermissions on your files.\n\n560\n00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.520\nAnd when you've got cloud\nstorage there's actually a few\n\n561\n00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.450\ndifferent ways that you\ncan set permissions.\n\n562\n00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.960\nYou probably already know this one, like\nwhen I was looking in index.html here,\n\n563\n00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.190\nlet me pull this screen back up.\n\n564\n00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:24.150\nIf we go into index.html and\nI was in metadata,\n\n565\n00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.100\nlet me just collapse metadata down.\n\n566\n00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.030\nI've got permissions.\n\n567\n00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:32.716\nAnd right here in permissions I can set\nwhat's called an access control list,\n\n568\n00:27:32.716 --> 00:27:33.219\nan ACL.\n\n569\n00:27:33.219 --> 00:27:35.940\nAnd an access control list is\nsomething we have in normal storage.\n\n570\n00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.820\nYou can define who's\nallowed to access this.\n\n571\n00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.780\nYou'll notice my awsdemo account,\nI've got Open/Download, View Permissions,\n\n572\n00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.080\nEdit Permissions.\n\n573\n00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.310\nBut then everyone else\nneeds higher planet.\n\n574\n00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.430\nI've given open and\ndownload and that's it, right?\n\n575\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.760\nSo this is basically a public file,\nanybody can get in and out.\n\n576\n00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.280\nMaybe I don't want that, if I don’t\nwant that, I can remove that permission.\n\n577\n00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.150\nThere, and\nnow everyone doesn't have access to it.\n\n578\n00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:02.340\nOr I can add more permissions, and\nI can put particular people, like me.\n\n579\n00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.250\nIf I wanna give me specifically access, or\n\n580\n00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.270\nI might have other user accounts\nthat I wanna give access to.\n\n581\n00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.960\nAnd I can start to grant them, all right?\n\n582\n00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.680\nIt's up to me to set that.\n\n583\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.320\nBut if I save this, now AWS demo's\nthe only one who can get it.\n\n584\n00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.520\nIf I try and access something anonymously\nor through a different web browser, like I\n\n585\n00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.500\nused Chrome earlier If I try that again,\nlook what I get, access denied, right?\n\n586\n00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.961\nThis is probably a better way to view\nthat where it doesn't get all pixely.\n\n587\n00:28:25.961 --> 00:28:27.730\nThere we go, access denied.\n\n588\n00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:30.170\nI can see I didn't have permission\nto access that resource.\n\n589\n00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.960\nSo tweaking the permissions,\n\n590\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.880\nthe ACLs work really well but\nwe can go even beyond that right?\n\n591\n00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.230\nAccess control are great if your trying\nto limit based on user or group.\n\n592\n00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.180\nBut what if I wanna limit by\nsomething else, like IP address, or\n\n593\n00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.860\nwhat web page you came from, or\nwhat virtual machine you're on?\n\n594\n00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.970\nThat stuff really starts to get tricky.\n\n595\n00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:52.370\nAnd so in AWS, and\nin most of the other providers,\n\n596\n00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.100\nwe have what are called access policies.\n\n597\n00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.080\nAnd an access policy is where\nyou define who has what access\n\n598\n00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.240\nbased on any number of criteria.\n\n599\n00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.820\nSo let me just show you an example here.\n\n600\n00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:06.950\nIf I go to, well, I'm in my\npermissions for the individual file.\n\n601\n00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.261\nMy policy is actually gonna\nbe set on the bucket itself.\n\n602\n00:29:09.261 --> 00:29:14.266\nSo I'm gonna go back up to\nmy itprotv-demo bucket and\n\n603\n00:29:14.266 --> 00:29:18.480\nin the bucket, I can go to permissions.\n\n604\n00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.560\nAnd see how I have an acl here for the\nbucket, which is basically like a folder.\n\n605\n00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.570\nAnd then I have permissions.\n\n606\n00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:27.890\nAnd on the folder part,\ntechnically AWS doesn't have folders.\n\n607\n00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:28.480\nIt looks like it.\n\n608\n00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.920\nYou can create folders, but\nin reality those folders are just tags.\n\n609\n00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.820\nSo you're tagging various things\nas having that particular tag and\n\n610\n00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.650\nit just looks like a folder.\n\n611\n00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.800\nBut if I have permissions,\nI can limit based on user group.\n\n612\n00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.950\nOr I can add a bucket policy.\n\n613\n00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:44.320\nAnd if I add a bucket policy,\nnow I can restrict by\n\n614\n00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.090\nall sorts of different things and let me\njust go into the sample bucket policy,\n\n615\n00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:50.230\ncuz Amazon has a couple of\nreally good samples for this.\n\n616\n00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.980\nAnd I'll put these in the show\nnotes if you want them.\n\n617\n00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.980\nBut, let's find something\nsimple like here, an address.\n\n618\n00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:02.810\nSo here they're creating a policy\nthat basically says we want to allow\n\n619\n00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:08.560\ncertain things and\nwe want to allow it based on IP address.\n\n620\n00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.780\nSo when you look at this it's saying\nhere we're going to allow access to this\n\n621\n00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:16.820\nexample bucket, and it's examplebucket/*,\nso everything inside of that bucket.\n\n622\n00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.340\nAnd their gonna do that if your\nsource IP matches this address and\n\n623\n00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.780\ntheir gonna block it,\nif it matches this address.\n\n624\n00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.810\nSo being very very specific here\nin saying we allow this addresses,\n\n625\n00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:29.710\nwe block this other one's.\n\n626\n00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.460\nNo username and password required, just\nstraight up here's how you can access it.\n\n627\n00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.890\nAnd they show an example of doing an HTTP\nrefer also, like I might want people to be\n\n628\n00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.750\nable to access the file only if\nthey're coming from my website.\n\n629\n00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.870\nThis is a great way to stop people from\nembedding you content on their own website\n\n630\n00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.220\nand using your bandwidth.\n\n631\n00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.480\nSo here they're saying, yes,\n\n632\n00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:51.210\nyou can get to any content in this bucket\nas long as you're coming from example.com.\n\n633\n00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.000\nRight?\nOr whatever that URL is.\n\n634\n00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.400\nSo policies let you go much further than\njust filtering on username and password.\n\n635\n00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.650\nRight?\nOr group membership.\n\n636\n00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.630\nNow you can do IP address.\n\n637\n00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:02.560\nYou can do all sorts of things.\n\n638\n00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.060\nYou can filter based on what\nweb browser people are using.\n\n639\n00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:09.410\nIn the virtualization world we can filter\nbased on what virtual machine it is right?\n\n640\n00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:14.460\nThis one VM is allowed to access\nthis one hard drive, nobody else is,\n\n641\n00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:19.020\nand that's really important because\nremember if we have shared storage,\n\n642\n00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.180\nin theory I can have more than one server\n\n643\n00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.260\ntry to access the same virtual hard drive\nat the same time Daniel do you know what\n\n644\n00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.760\nhappens if two systems access\nthe same data at the same time?\n\n645\n00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.880\n>> Never crossed the streams.\n\n646\n00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.352\nTotal platonic reversal.\n\n647\n00:31:32.352 --> 00:31:33.090\n>> Exactly.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n648\n00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:34.950\n>> Yeah, if two systems try and\n\n649\n00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.440\nread from the same drive at the same time,\nit's actually not that big of a deal.\n\n650\n00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.320\nI mean it's slow, but it's not a big deal.\n\n651\n00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.220\nBut if they try and write at the same\ntime, it's instant data corruption.\n\n652\n00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.471\nYour data gets corrupted.\n\n653\n00:31:44.471 --> 00:31:48.878\nSo we need some kind of check in place\nthat stops two systems from writing to\n\n654\n00:31:48.878 --> 00:31:52.874\nthe same data at the same time and\nyour shared storage will do that.\n\n655\n00:31:52.874 --> 00:31:56.474\nAnd it may do it Through policies\nthat restrict who has access.\n\n656\n00:31:56.474 --> 00:31:59.912\nOr it may do it through some other\nkind of software control like Xsan or\n\n657\n00:31:59.912 --> 00:32:04.070\nsomething where it's tracking all that and\nwho has access to what.\n\n658\n00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:06.900\nMicrosoft's Failover Clustering\ndoes a really good job of it,\n\n659\n00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.040\nrestricting that access\nto individual machines.\n\n660\n00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.460\nAnd when you have a failure,\nthen another machine can take over and\n\n661\n00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.790\nhave that right access to\nbe able to access the disc.\n\n662\n00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:19.030\nSo that's all kind of a part of this\nprocess, all part of cloud storage.\n\n663\n00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.830\nAnd you guys start to see how this is so\nimportant,\n\n664\n00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:24.160\nbecause this is physical\ninfrastructure we're talking about.\n\n665\n00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.480\nAnd if we have this set up wrong, and\nwe start laying a bunch of virtual\n\n666\n00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.110\ninfrastructure on top of it, you can't go\nback and fix the physical infrastructure\n\n667\n00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.570\nwithout breaking all of your\nvirtual infrastructure.\n\n668\n00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.090\nSo we need to understand these concepts,\nhow they work, and\n\n669\n00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:38.100\nmake sure we take that into\naccount from early on.\n\n670\n00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.280\n>> Yeah,\nobviously this is not child's play.\n\n671\n00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.960\nYou want to make sure that you have\nthis under control, under wraps,\n\n672\n00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:49.695\nin your comprehension as it were,\nbefore you start trying to go too\n\n673\n00:32:49.695 --> 00:32:53.480\nin-depth with building an infrastructure\nbased on this type of technology.\n\n674\n00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.390\nBut as you can see, Don is showing\nyou that even though it's different\n\n675\n00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:00.240\nfrom traditional models\nit's not that difficult.\n\n676\n00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.140\nYou just have to start to understand\nhow it is they do things and\n\n677\n00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.700\nhow things are working that way.\n\n678\n00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.820\nDon, that being said, is there anything\nelse that we need to cover when it comes\n\n679\n00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.530\nto storage in the cloud?\n\n680\n00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.140\n>> I got one last thing\nthat I forgot to mention,\n\n681\n00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:16.200\nwhich is, I said how important this stuff\nwas and I mentioned how we might want to\n\n682\n00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.700\nreplicate our SANs, you know, to have\nan extra copy of that data somewhere else.\n\n683\n00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.960\nYou definitely want to do that.\n\n684\n00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.490\nAnd in your own system, if you've\ngot your own local private cloud,\n\n685\n00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:28.620\nyou buy another SAN,\nyou stick it somewhere else, and\n\n686\n00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.170\nyou set up replication software\nto replicate that data.\n\n687\n00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:32.770\nIf you buy EMC SANs,\n\n688\n00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:36.780\nthey have their own replication built\nright into them, HP has the same thing.\n\n689\n00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.760\nIt's an extra license you have to pay for.\n\n690\n00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.180\nThere's third party software\nlike RepliStore that'll do it.\n\n691\n00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.050\nThere's plenty of different ways to\nreplicate your data from one SAN\n\n692\n00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.220\nto another.\n\n693\n00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:48.880\nIf you're using cloud storage,\nlike with Amazon Web Services or\n\n694\n00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.540\nMicrosoft Azure, they make it really easy.\n\n695\n00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.260\nWith Azure,\nthey're already replicating your data.\n\n696\n00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.560\nWith AWS, you just have to turn it on.\n\n697\n00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.770\nLet me show you.\n\n698\n00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:02.250\nSo looking at that ITProTV demo bucket\nthat I was in a moment ago, when I'm in\n\n699\n00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:07.090\nit's Properties, if I scroll down a little\nbit you've got Cross-Region Replication.\n\n700\n00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.335\nThey're backing up your data already,\nbut I can come in here to\n\n701\n00:34:10.335 --> 00:34:14.960\nCross-Region Replication, I can turn on\nversioning, and then that'll let me turn\n\n702\n00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:20.390\non Cross-Region Replication and\nnow I can choose to replicate this bucket.\n\n703\n00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:25.380\nRight now it's in the East US, but I can\nchoose to replicate it somewhere else and\n\n704\n00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.590\nI might wanna store a copy\nof it in the West US.\n\n705\n00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.150\nMaybe Oregon, that one's cheaper.\n\n706\n00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:34.051\nAnd so I can throw it over there and\nspecify a bucket to replicate it to, so\n\n707\n00:34:34.051 --> 00:34:37.799\nI can now have a second copy of\nthis data in another region.\n\n708\n00:34:37.799 --> 00:34:42.050\nIf something happens to the east US it\ncan be available in the west US and\n\n709\n00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.060\nI've got that copy, and\n\n710\n00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:46.600\nanytime I add new data it's automatically\nbeing replicated and kept in sync.\n\n711\n00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.970\nThat's important because if your storage\ngoes offline, right, if you've got shared\n\n712\n00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:55.560\nstorage and the storage goes offline,\nall your virtual machines go offline.\n\n713\n00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.510\nSo having that replica really, really key.\n\n714\n00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.520\n>> Yeah, it'll save your bacon.\n\n715\n00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.810\nYou don't want to lose your data at all so\n\n716\n00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:05.190\nturning on any type of replication\nthat you can get away with, do it,\n\n717\n00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:09.100\nit's just insurance for your data,\nand how much is your data worth?\n\n718\n00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.170\nWell, if you're in business, it's worth\neverything, so make sure you employ that.\n\n719\n00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.540\nDon, you've done a great\njob with us today.\n\n720\n00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.050\nYou've showed us some of the concepts and\n\n721\n00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:21.430\nthe terminologies and even some security\nthat can help us stay out of the weeds.\n\n722\n00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:24.160\nWe thank you so much for joining us today,\nand we thank you guys for watching.\n\n723\n00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.469\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n724\n00:35:26.469 --> 00:35:27.618\nI'm your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n725\n00:35:27.618 --> 00:35:28.490\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n726\n00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:30.579\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n727\n00:35:30.579 --> 00:35:37.470\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:20.838\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we're continuing on with that\n\n4\n00:00:20.838 --> 00:00:23.770\ncloud plus from comp T content\nwe've been working on.\n\n5\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.420\nJoining us back in the studio to\nlend his giant, massive knowledge\n\n6\n00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.880\nto this very topic is none other\nthan our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.290\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.340\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel,\n\n9\n00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.900\nready to jump right back into the world\nof Cloud Plus and in this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.180\nwe're gonna take a look at some kind\nof principles and concepts, right?\n\n11\n00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.030\nSo the episode's called\nVirtualization Infrastructure.\n\n12\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.590\nAnd what we want to talk about\nis at a conceptual level,\n\n13\n00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.440\nwhat's gonna make this whole cloud work?\n\n14\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.750\nIf you want to set up a private could,\nor if you're going into a public cloud.\n\n15\n00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.510\nWhat is it going on under\nthe hood that makes that happen?\n\n16\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.390\nWe see the virtual machines, but\n\n17\n00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.030\nwe need to understand what's underneath\nit, and some of the differences between\n\n18\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.690\nthe different software\npackages that are out there.\n\n19\n00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.190\nSo that what we're gonna talk about here,\nand get a chance to see it.\n\n20\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.320\nIn the next episode we're\ngonna actually use it.\n\n21\n00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.970\nAnd I know that's what a lot\nof you guys are waiting for.\n\n22\n00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.120\nCome on let's get in there and\ncreate some virtual machines.\n\n23\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.100\nWe'll get to that.\n\n24\n00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.220\nWe gotta understand the foundational\nknowledge first before we jump in.\n\n25\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.090\nSo that's what we're gonna\ntake a look at right here.\n\n26\n00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.660\n>> Yeah this is really the meat and\npotatoes of the Cloud infrastructure.\n\n27\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.990\nThat's what we we're talking about.\n\n28\n00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.940\nWhat do we need to build this to make\nit all work, and make it all happen.\n\n29\n00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.440\nWhether it be private,\nwhether it be pubic.\n\n30\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.920\nOr there be a hybrid, or\nwhatever you have going on.\n\n31\n00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.740\nYou gotta understand how\ndoes that even fit together\n\n32\n00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.520\nbefore you can actually start putting\nthe blocks on top of each other.\n\n33\n00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.180\nSo that's where we're gonna go.\n\n34\n00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.510\nAnd Don, I've been a part of building\na public cloud infrastructure,\n\n35\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.290\nI've done that.\n\n36\n00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.920\nSo I'm really looking\nforward to the private cloud.\n\n37\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.180\nThe other way around.\n\n38\n00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.150\nI'm sorry.\n\n39\n00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.860\nEither way.\n\n40\n00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.160\n>> I'll go crowd the cloud.\n\n41\n00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.830\nNo public cloud.\n\n42\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.630\nSo, I look forward to seeing how that\nworks out, and where's a good place for\n\n43\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.690\nus to begin with this.\n\n44\n00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.920\nWhat is the foundations\nthat we need to know?\n\n45\n00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.830\n>> All right.\nWell, let's start with just the benefits\n\n46\n00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.830\nof why we would even bother\nwith this in the first place?\n\n47\n00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.200\nBecause some people might be asking that.\n\n48\n00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.870\nLike hey I have 20 servers, and\neach servers dedicated to one task.\n\n49\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.310\nThey're physical servers,\nthey do their job.\n\n50\n00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.210\nWhy would I even bother\ngoing into virtualization?\n\n51\n00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.510\nAnd there's a lot of reasons.\n\n52\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.530\nSo let's talk about that.\n\n53\n00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.260\nThe first benefit is shared resources.\n\n54\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.640\nAnd this is a problem I've\nbumped into many, many times.\n\n55\n00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.470\nSo let's see, I've got a diagram\nI kinda whipped up here.\n\n56\n00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.710\nLet's say that I've got three servers,\nand one's a DNS server.\n\n57\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.880\nOne's a Active Directory domain\ncontroller and the other's a file server.\n\n58\n00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.130\nAnd they each have a terabyte of storage.\n\n59\n00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.640\nWell, a DNS server.\n\n60\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.770\nIs it gonna use a terabyte of storage?\n\n61\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.820\nNo, it's just gonna use\na fraction of that.\n\n62\n00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.650\nAn Active Directory domain controller?\n\n63\n00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.750\nEven in the biggest domains, it's rare for\na directory to break one gig in size,\n\n64\n00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.690\nbetter yet a terabyte.\n\n65\n00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.120\nSo that's not gonna use it.\n\n66\n00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.560\nBut a file server?\n\n67\n00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.560\nIt'll eat that terabyte up real fast.\n\n68\n00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.290\nAnd what do you do when you run\nout of that terabyte of storage?\n\n69\n00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.250\nWell, I've got extra storage here and\nI've got extra storage here.\n\n70\n00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.260\nI can just borrow some of that, right?\n\n71\n00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.170\nNot really.\n\n72\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.860\nWhat you end up with is file shares here,\nfile shares here, file shares here.\n\n73\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.050\nData is all over the place, and you're\ntrying to back it up and restore it and\n\n74\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.360\nit just becomes a mess.\n\n75\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.310\nYou can't share those resources.\n\n76\n00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.210\nLet's talk about CPU.\n\n77\n00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.840\nRight?\n\n78\n00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.920\nCPU on a domain controller\ncan get really busy, but\n\n79\n00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.650\nCPU on a file server, CPU on DNS.\n\n80\n00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.520\nNo really.\n\n81\n00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.530\nCan I borrow CPUs cycles from one\nof these guys to use on server two?\n\n82\n00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.010\nNo.\n\n83\n00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.730\nIf server two starts getting to slow,\n\n84\n00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.130\nif it states running out of CPU cycles,\nI need to scale up.\n\n85\n00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.320\nI need to upgrade that hardware,\nI need to add CPUs if I can, or\n\n86\n00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.250\nreplace it with a beefier server.\n\n87\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.350\nThat's tough because I've got wasted\nresources in these other systems.\n\n88\n00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.210\nAnd even if I wasn't wasting resources,\nservers have peaks and\n\n89\n00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.500\nvalleys of activity.\n\n90\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.600\nThere'll be times where yes,\nthis server is at 80% CPU constantly.\n\n91\n00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.050\nBut then there'll be times\nwhere it's at 20% CPU.\n\n92\n00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.350\nAnd I can't share the extra\nresources between systems.\n\n93\n00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.040\nSo sharing, that's one of the biggest\nbenefits of going to a cloud, private or\n\n94\n00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.890\npublic, is that you have shared resources.\n\n95\n00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.550\nAnd I know in other episodes I've\ntalked about shared storage.\n\n96\n00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.100\nWhere instead of having one\nterabyte dedicated to each server,\n\n97\n00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.800\nI could have three terabytes in the SAN\nand I could slice off some data.\n\n98\n00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.910\nSlice off one terabyte and\ngive it to server three.\n\n99\n00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.760\nAnd just slice off a 100 megs for\nserver one.\n\n100\n00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.950\nA 100 gigs.\n\n101\n00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.130\nA 100 gigs for server one.\n\n102\n00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.320\nA 100 gigs for server two.\n\n103\n00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.990\nAnd if they need more, I can always\nslice off more and give it to them.\n\n104\n00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.530\nBut now it's a shared resource.\n\n105\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.560\nThat's one of the biggest advantages\ngoing one of these clouds.\n\n106\n00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.990\nAnd how that data is shared\nis kind of important,\n\n107\n00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.570\ncuz different platforms\nhandle it different ways.\n\n108\n00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.880\nWe're gonna see that\nlater in this episode.\n\n109\n00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.900\nAnother benefit is elasticity, right?\n\n110\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.370\nElasticity is the ability to grow and\ncontract as needed, and\n\n111\n00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.510\nwe talked about that\nin an earlier episode.\n\n112\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.710\nI might not always need three servers.\n\n113\n00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.310\nMaybe I need three web servers\nwhen I'm at peak activity, but\n\n114\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.750\nnormally I just need one.\n\n115\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.930\nAnd so when I go to a cloud I can scale\nup to three servers when I need it and\n\n116\n00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.850\nscale down to one server when I don't.\n\n117\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.120\nAnd I have that flexibility.\n\n118\n00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.920\nAnd it's returning the resources into\na pool so they can be reused elsewhere.\n\n119\n00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.680\nRight, and again, benefits of sharing.\n\n120\n00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.070\nOther things.\n\n121\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.200\nI can start to isolate applications.\n\n122\n00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.750\nWhen we run on physical\nservers it's really common for\n\n123\n00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.610\npeople to say you know what\nI'm gonna make server two\n\n124\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.730\nan active directory domain controller,\nand a DNS server, and DHCP.\n\n125\n00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.490\nI'm gonna load it all in there cuz\nthe hardware can handle it just fine.\n\n126\n00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.070\nAnd you're right.\n\n127\n00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.420\nThe hardware can handle it just fine.\n\n128\n00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.540\nYou're doing the right thing.\n\n129\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.190\nYou're making the most\nuse of that hardware.\n\n130\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.059\nBut what happens if my DHCP server\ncrashes and I need to reboot it?\n\n131\n00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.970\nWell, that means I gotta reboot\nmy active directory and my DNS,\n\n132\n00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.920\nalso, cuz they're all\non the same hardware.\n\n133\n00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.710\nThey're all sharing that operating system,\nso one application can affect another.\n\n134\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.600\nBut when I go virtual, I can divide\nthese up into separate servers.\n\n135\n00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.760\nI can have a dedicated DNS server and\na dedicated DHTTP server and\n\n136\n00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.160\na dedicated domain controller.\n\n137\n00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.750\nAnd if I need to reboot one of\nthem it doesn't effect the others.\n\n138\n00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.560\nAnd I can do that cuz in a virtual\nenvironment we're sharing\n\n139\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.850\nthe hardware anyway and so\nthey have access to what they need.\n\n140\n00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.760\nBut in a physical environment\nI don't get sharing.\n\n141\n00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.690\nAnd so it makes sense to have multiple\nroles on one server which makes it more\n\n142\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.960\ndifficult to troubleshoot and\nmore sensitive when a failure does happen.\n\n143\n00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.960\nSo, it's kind of a weaker model that way.\n\n144\n00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.210\nOther benefits,\nconsolidating infrastructure.\n\n145\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.060\nI've done this.\n\n146\n00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.030\nI used to work for\na bank out in Seattle and\n\n147\n00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.350\nwhen I started there,\nwe had about 275 servers.\n\n148\n00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:25.200\nOne of the things I had to work on was\nthey told me, we were in a skyscraper.\n\n149\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.750\nWe had the 17th through the 22nd floor.\n\n150\n00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.140\nAnd the data center was right\nthere on the 19th floor.\n\n151\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.080\nAnd they told me, they said Don.\n\n152\n00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.900\nWe can't bring in anymore servers,\ncuz we're at floor load, right.\n\n153\n00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.640\nWe were at the maximum weight for\nthat floor, and\n\n154\n00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.590\nif we had brought any more servers in,\nwe'd go overweight, and you run the risk\n\n155\n00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.750\nof the 19th floor data center\nbecoming the 18th floor data center.\n\n156\n00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.335\n>> That'd be a fun day [LAUGH].\n\n157\n00:06:45.335 --> 00:06:45.951\n>> Yeah, so, it was fun,\n\n158\n00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:48.950\ncuz every time we brought in a new server,\nwe had to take an old server out.\n\n159\n00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.490\nBut you had to, this kind of equal,\nyou had to measure everything.\n\n160\n00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.910\nIt was kind of a pain.\n\n161\n00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.850\nSo, it was all physical servers.\n\n162\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.960\nThere were 275 servers,\neach doing dedicated tasks, and\n\n163\n00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.020\nwe said, you know what,\nlet's bring in VMware.\n\n164\n00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.180\nLet's To create a private cloud,\nlet's start virtualizing things.\n\n165\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.900\nI don't need three dedicated DNS servers.\n\n166\n00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.870\nI can have two virtual DNS servers.\n\n167\n00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.570\nAnd I don't need this many domain\ncontrollers, I can do virtual and so on.\n\n168\n00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.690\nAnd as we started virtualizing\nthings we got to where we use\n\n169\n00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:24.810\nto have 275 physical servers, now we\nhad 275, some virtual, some physical.\n\n170\n00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.420\nSome things had to stay physical right,\nbut a lot of things went virtual.\n\n171\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.350\nWe had just virtualization\nservers as the physical side.\n\n172\n00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.971\nAnd it got us down to, I think when\nI left we were somewhere in the 120,\n\n173\n00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:40.270\n130 area for a number of servers.\n\n174\n00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.710\nSignificantly lower, like less than\nhalf of the servers when I started.\n\n175\n00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.530\nWe were well below the weight\nthreshold for that floor.\n\n176\n00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.910\nWe can add new systems and\nwe can have that functionality.\n\n177\n00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.420\nWe actually thought the air\nconditioning was broken once.\n\n178\n00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.756\nWe had these two giant air conditioning\nunits at the main data center,\n\n179\n00:07:55.756 --> 00:07:58.837\nand they both ran at 50% all the time.\n\n180\n00:07:58.837 --> 00:08:02.963\nThat way, if one died, the other one would\njust ramp up to 100% and cool the room.\n\n181\n00:08:02.963 --> 00:08:07.004\nWell one day I came in to make a check and\none of the units wasn't running.\n\n182\n00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:10.109\nOne unit was at 50% and the other one\nwasn't running, and so immediately you\n\n183\n00:08:10.109 --> 00:08:12.935\nstart the maintenance plan like okay\nwe gotta find out what's going on,\n\n184\n00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:16.810\nthe other one didn't ramp up to 100%,\nthis one's not working, what's going on?\n\n185\n00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.200\nBecause an air conditioning\nfailure in a data center,\n\n186\n00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.810\nthat can cause your servers\nto thermal shutdown.\n\n187\n00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:27.370\nWell it turned out we had removed enough\nservers That one unit running at 50%\n\n188\n00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.330\nwas enough to cool the whole room, that\nwe didn't need two units running at 50%.\n\n189\n00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.550\nSo you could bring them down.\n\n190\n00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.880\nWe ended up having to get them tuned so\nthat they both ran at 25%.\n\n191\n00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.860\nCuz you still want the other one running,\n\n192\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.460\nyou don't want an AC unit just\nsitting there doing nothing.\n\n193\n00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.210\nSo we ended up having to get that tuned.\n\n194\n00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.340\nBut it was neat cuz we didn't expect that,\nit just sort of happened.\n\n195\n00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.370\nThose are benefits.\n\n196\n00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.120\nSome of the reasons why we want\nto start virtualizing things.\n\n197\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.731\n>> And you lowered your carbon footprint.\n\n198\n00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:49.740\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n199\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.700\n>> Saved some money as well.\n\n200\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.690\n>> Doesn't matter if you're\na Republican or Democrat or\n\n201\n00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:53.230\nwhatever-\n>> That's right.\n\n202\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.480\n>> Everyone likes saving some money and\n\n203\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.038\nthen-\n>> That's right.\n\n204\n00:08:55.038 --> 00:08:56.100\n[LAUGH]\n>> that's what that does.\n\n205\n00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.580\nSo those are some of the reasons why\nwe might choose to virtualize systems.\n\n206\n00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.528\nNow if you choose to virtualize them,\nif you choose to go this way and\n\n207\n00:09:02.528 --> 00:09:04.150\ncreate a private cloud.\n\n208\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:09.350\nThe first thing we've got to\ndo is select a hypervisor.\n\n209\n00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.430\nAll right, now what is a hypervisor?\n\n210\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.850\nA hypervisor is the software that\nruns on your physical server\n\n211\n00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.530\nthat allows it to host virtual machines.\n\n212\n00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.410\nIf I wanna take a physical server and\nmake it a virtual server,\n\n213\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.200\nit's gotta run on top of a hypervisor.\n\n214\n00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.068\nAnd there are many,\nmany different ones that are out there.\n\n215\n00:09:25.068 --> 00:09:26.615\nAll right.\n\n216\n00:09:26.615 --> 00:09:30.970\nWell, when you've got a physical server,\nthis is kind of what it looks like.\n\n217\n00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.140\nAnd I know I've used this\ndiagram in other episodes.\n\n218\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.430\nIt's not anything new.\n\n219\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.440\nBut you've got your\nphysical infrastructure.\n\n220\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.240\nRight.\nThat which is\n\n221\n00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.550\nyour networking and all that.\n\n222\n00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.210\nAnd you're gonna have that in\na virtual environment too.\n\n223\n00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.040\nYou've always got your\nphysical infrastructure.\n\n224\n00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.230\nLike UPSs, generators,\nyou can't virtualize a UPS.\n\n225\n00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.520\nYou just have to have one.\n\n226\n00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.810\nBut your server hardware that is\nsomething you can virtualize, right?\n\n227\n00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.120\nAnd your server hardware is then\nhosting an operating system and\n\n228\n00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.840\nyour operating system then\nhosts your application.\n\n229\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.990\nAnd if we're doing this on dedicated\nhardware, well all of this represents\n\n230\n00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.140\none physical server and then they have\nother ones that are in place, right?\n\n231\n00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.020\nWell when I virtualize I take\nthe operating system, and\n\n232\n00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.000\nI take the application software, and I put\nthat inside of a virtual machine that's\n\n233\n00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.620\nthen running on hardware that's no longer\ndedicated to just that operating system.\n\n234\n00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.470\nIt can be applied to more\nthan one operating system.\n\n235\n00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.900\nAnd so\nwhen we do that we choose a hypervisor and\n\n236\n00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.400\nthe hypervisors are grouped\ninto two classes.\n\n237\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.000\nYou have type one hypervisors and\ntype two hypervisors.\n\n238\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.180\nType two hypervisors\nare actually the original ones.\n\n239\n00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.480\nIt's kind of backwards.\n\n240\n00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.230\nBut the type two hypervisors are the ones\nthat really started virtualization.\n\n241\n00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.050\nAnd they're not very good, but\nthey serve a particular purpose.\n\n242\n00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.950\nType one hypervisors are the good ones.\n\n243\n00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.370\nThose are the ones you wanna use.\n\n244\n00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.440\nThey're the newer ones, and\nby newer I mean in the last 10 years.\n\n245\n00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.510\nBut they're the ones you wanna use and\nthey correct a lot of things.\n\n246\n00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.140\nBut I'm gonna start with\ntype two hypervisors\n\n247\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.800\nbecause these were the original ones,\nall right?\n\n248\n00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.510\nWhat a type two hypervisor was was\nreally just a software program.\n\n249\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.990\nYou had your server hardware.\n\n250\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.565\nAnd your server hardware you had CPU,\nRAM, Network, Disk, right?\n\n251\n00:11:07.565 --> 00:11:09.930\nThose were the components you had\nwhen you bought a physical server,\n\n252\n00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.002\nthat's what you were buying.\n\n253\n00:11:11.002 --> 00:11:14.885\nSo maybe I had 32 gigs of RAM,\nand four CPUs, and\n\n254\n00:11:14.885 --> 00:11:19.895\ntwo gigabit network adapters,\nand a few terabytes of storage.\n\n255\n00:11:19.895 --> 00:11:22.830\nRight, that's all in my server hardware.\n\n256\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.410\nAnd on my physical server,\nI've gotta run an operating system.\n\n257\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:29.760\nSo I run Windows server or\nLinux, some application,\n\n258\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.580\nor not an application, but operating\nsystem like that on the hardware.\n\n259\n00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:40.388\nAnd on top of that operating system,\nI then run my hypervisor, right?\n\n260\n00:11:40.388 --> 00:11:44.480\nBut Type two hypervisor is software we\ninstall on top of our operating system.\n\n261\n00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.070\nAnd it normally comes with management\nsoftware to be able to manage it, right,\n\n262\n00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:47.840\nthat's kind of a part.\n\n263\n00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.860\nI put these as one on top of the other,\nbut\n\n264\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.230\nreally, they're basically side by side.\n\n265\n00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.110\nYou run the hypervisor and\n\n266\n00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.810\nyou run the management software\ntypically on top of the host OS.\n\n267\n00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.120\nNow what that hypervisor does here,\n\n268\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.560\nis it then begins to create fake\nhardware for virtual machines, right?\n\n269\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.070\nTechnically it's an emulator.\n\n270\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.980\nIt's emulating that certain\nhardware exists, and so\n\n271\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.370\nif I wanna create a virtual machine, the\noperating system running on the hardware\n\n272\n00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.180\nis called the host, it's the one\nthat's hosting this hypervisor.\n\n273\n00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.570\nBut every other virtual machine I\nstick on there is called a guest,\n\n274\n00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.290\na guest operating system,\nit's like a visitor.\n\n275\n00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.360\nHey, I'm just gonna come by and\nhang out on your hardware.\n\n276\n00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.290\nAll right, I like to think of\nvirtualization as carpooling.\n\n277\n00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.800\nIn your car, you've got four,\nfive seats, right?\n\n278\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.880\nSo in my car, we've got five seats.\n\n279\n00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.090\nAnd when I drove to work today,\nI drove by myself.\n\n280\n00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.020\nI was the only person in that car.\n\n281\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.380\nSo I had four more seats that were empty.\n\n282\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.080\nI didn't get full utilization\nof my resources, right?\n\n283\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.940\nBut I can have some guests come over.\n\n284\n00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.570\nI can have some other\npeople hop in the car.\n\n285\n00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.580\nAnd now I take full advantage of it.\n\n286\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.780\nAssuming we're all going\nto the same place, right.\n\n287\n00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.390\nWell on a server, it's the same way we\nhave a lot of wasted resources, and\n\n288\n00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.092\nthese guests, they're the people\nwho are tagging along with you.\n\n289\n00:12:57.092 --> 00:13:00.100\nThey're the people who are carpooling\nwith you on this server.\n\n290\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.760\nBut the guest operating system\nmay not match the host.\n\n291\n00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.200\nMy host might be Linux.\n\n292\n00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:11.580\nI might be running Red Hat Linux and I'm\nrunning a VMware desktop on Red Hat Linux.\n\n293\n00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.820\nWell, if I'm doing that,\nI can then start to create guest OSs.\n\n294\n00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.680\nAnd I might have a guest virtual machine\nthat's Windows, or one that's Linux.\n\n295\n00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.040\nMaybe it's Red Hat Linux, maybe it's\nUbuntu or Cent OS or something else.\n\n296\n00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.220\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n297\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.760\nBecause when that\noperating system boots up,\n\n298\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:32.730\nit's gonna see a virtual CPU, virtual\nmemory, virtual Network, virtual Disk.\n\n299\n00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.210\nIt sees a fake set up hardware all right?\n\n300\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:37.690\nNow why is that important?\n\n301\n00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.500\nWell it's important because\nof what happens when we go to\n\n302\n00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.120\naccess that hardware.\n\n303\n00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.040\nWhen you go to access the hardware,\n\n304\n00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.500\nyou're installing your applications on\ntop of that guest operating system.\n\n305\n00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.030\nAnd, that completely failed to work.\n\n306\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.940\nSo you're installing that application and\nwhen that application needs to access\n\n307\n00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.130\nsomething, like maybe it\nneeds to access the disk.\n\n308\n00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.550\nSo it's gotta read from the hard drive.\n\n309\n00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:04.130\nAnd when it goes to read from that\nhard drive, what's gonna happen there?\n\n310\n00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.570\nWell, it's gonna go.\n\n311\n00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.880\nWe'll make this nice and\npurple so we can see it.\n\n312\n00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.920\nSo it's gonna go and reach out to\nthat disk, but it's a fake disk.\n\n313\n00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.590\nIt's not a real disk.\n\n314\n00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:17.020\nAnd so your hypervisor's going\nto intercept that call and\n\n315\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.020\nsay, I see you writing to the disk.\n\n316\n00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.490\nAnd it's gonna translate that.\n\n317\n00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:25.670\nAnd it's gonna turn it into a real call,\n\n318\n00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:29.030\nwhere the hypervisor is\ngoing to turn around and\n\n319\n00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:35.320\nsend that to the real physical disk,\nlike that.\n\n320\n00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.250\nSo every call that this\napplication is doing,\n\n321\n00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.250\nevery time it reaches out to hardware\na translation has to happen,\n\n322\n00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.610\nto translate that into\na call to the real hardware.\n\n323\n00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.410\nWhen it accesses CPU, RAM, Network, Disk,\n\n324\n00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:51.000\nthe big four for performance,\nthat's all being virtualized, and fake.\n\n325\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.210\nAnd that's where we get a performance hit.\n\n326\n00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.190\nEvery call to hardware that would\nnormally be instantaneously responded to\n\n327\n00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.440\nnow has a translation.\n\n328\n00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.740\nAnd the translation is being\nperformed in software.\n\n329\n00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.850\nSo these become software calls that\nget translated to hardware and\n\n330\n00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.410\nit slows them down.\n\n331\n00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.445\nAnd that was one of the main negatives\nof a Type 2 Hypervisor is that\n\n332\n00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:15.340\nperformance-wise, it's not the same\nas running on real hardware.\n\n333\n00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.400\nAnd so in the early days,\n\n334\n00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.000\nlike in the early 1990s,\nwhen VMware was just starting, and\n\n335\n00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.270\nthey were promoting their VMware software,\nit was a Type 2 Hypervisor.\n\n336\n00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.960\nAnd there were other ones that were\nout there, like what was Microsoft's?\n\n337\n00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.940\nVirtual-\n>> Virtual PC, wasn't it?\n\n338\n00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.590\n>> Virtual PC, which they bought\nfrom Connectix, or whoever.\n\n339\n00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.760\nSo you had Virtual PC,\nyou had VMWare Desktop,\n\n340\n00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.950\nVMWare Fusion these days, Sun's VirtualBox\nwhich is now Oracle VirtualBox.\n\n341\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.210\nThose are all Type 2 hypervisors.\n\n342\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.947\nAnd because of the performance hit nobody,\n\n343\n00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:50.520\nno sysadmin that was worth their\nsalt would run them in production.\n\n344\n00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.087\nNobody wanted to run them in production\nbecause of the performance hit.\n\n345\n00:15:53.087 --> 00:15:55.587\nThey'd run on actual hardware.\n\n346\n00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:57.297\nRunning on hardware,\nyou get great performance.\n\n347\n00:15:57.297 --> 00:16:02.379\nRunning in a type two hypervisor, It gets\nslowed down because of the translation.\n\n348\n00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:05.386\nBut let me tell you,\nif you were doing development or testing,\n\n349\n00:16:05.386 --> 00:16:09.080\nif you were a student and you just\nwanted to learn, these were great.\n\n350\n00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.640\nI could run Windows and\nspin up a Linux machine.\n\n351\n00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.980\nI could be running CentOS, which is\nRed Hat based, and I wanna learn Debian.\n\n352\n00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.750\nAnd so I could bring up a Debian machine\nin a virtual machine and run it and learn.\n\n353\n00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.530\nI didn't care if it was a little\nbit slower cuz I was learning.\n\n354\n00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.550\nThis is how I learn half\nthe stuff that I know.\n\n355\n00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.670\nIt was all inside of virtual machines and\n\n356\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.840\nit really empowered you,\nespecially developers.\n\n357\n00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.980\nThey wanted to test something out but they\ndidn't wanna break the production system.\n\n358\n00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.290\nSo they could make a mirror image of the\nproduction system in a virtual machine,\n\n359\n00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.130\nthey could test it out.\n\n360\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.720\nYeah, it'd be slower, but your customers\naren't in it, so who cares, right?\n\n361\n00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.290\nType 2 hypervisors have a place.\n\n362\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.230\nI use type 2 hypervisors every single day.\n\n363\n00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.330\nI use them here on the show.\n\n364\n00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.030\nWhen you see me bring up virtual machines,\n\n365\n00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.070\nit's almost always in a type 2 hypervisor,\nall right?\n\n366\n00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.900\nThey just don't have\na place in production.\n\n367\n00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.280\nThat if you're bringing up web servers or\nthings for end users to see, you do not\n\n368\n00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.950\nwant to use a type 2 hypervisor because\nof that performance hit, all right?\n\n369\n00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.270\nBut this is how they function.\n\n370\n00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.020\nYou're accessing a virtual\nset of hardware, and\n\n371\n00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:08.450\nthen that virtual set of hardware is being\ntranslated to a real set of hardware.\n\n372\n00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.880\nSo for example, I've actually got a,\nlet's see not that one, this one.\n\n373\n00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.060\nThis is Windows 7.\n\n374\n00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.690\nNow, you guys have probably noticed I'm\non a Mac and so I am running Mac OS.\n\n375\n00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:22.720\nIf I go back here and go into my little,\nabout this Mac, here we go.\n\n376\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.960\nSo I'm running Mac OS 10.11.13 El Capitan.\n\n377\n00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.990\nSo I'm on a Mac but\nI'm running VMware Fusion, and\n\n378\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:35.770\nVMware Fusion, is a Type 2 hypervisor\nthat lets me create virtual machines.\n\n379\n00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.540\nAnd so I've got Windows 7,\nrunning right here, cuz I need Windows\n\n380\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.810\n7 sometimes to run Windows software,\ncuz I can't run it on a Mac, right?\n\n381\n00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.280\nSo, I've got it up and running.\n\n382\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.598\nNow, this virtual machine,\nit sees a hard drive.\n\n383\n00:17:47.598 --> 00:17:50.550\nIt's got its C drive right here and\nit thinks that it's 60 gigs in size, so\n\n384\n00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.750\nit sees a hard drive.\n\n385\n00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:58.790\nAnd if I go into its Device Manager it\nsees devices, it sees CPU, RAM, and so on.\n\n386\n00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:04.840\nNow, my laptop has 16 gigs of memory in\nit, but this system, if I come in here and\n\n387\n00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.160\npull it up, it thinks it that\nI only have 4 gigs of memory,\n\n388\n00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.770\nand that's because I've assigned 4 gigs\nof virtual memory to it, all right?\n\n389\n00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.770\nNow it is identifying my actual CPU but\n\n390\n00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.910\nother things like the network adapter,\nit would identify.\n\n391\n00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.330\nSo my laptop has anIntel\nnetwork adapter in it.\n\n392\n00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.890\nWho knows what it shows up as here.\n\n393\n00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:23.930\nLet's see.\n\n394\n00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:30.140\nIt shows up as an Intel PRO/1000, right,\nbut that's not what my laptop has.\n\n395\n00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.280\nMy laptop, I'm actually on\na wireless adapter right now, but\n\n396\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.540\nVMware Fusion is creating a virtual\nIntel PRO/1000 that this is seeing.\n\n397\n00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.870\nI have a different network adapter\nin my actual system, and so\n\n398\n00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.010\nthat's that translation\nthat I'm talking about.\n\n399\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.620\nHere it's gonna do calls\nto an Intel(R) PRO/1000.\n\n400\n00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.320\nVMware will then translate\nit to send it on my,\n\n401\n00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.490\nI think it's a Broadcom\nwireless card in this one.\n\n402\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.000\nSo it'll convert it over to go over\nthat network, and off it goes.\n\n403\n00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.330\nThe virtual machine doesn't see that,\nright, but it runs great, for me, for\n\n404\n00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.070\ntesting.\n\n405\n00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.980\nIf I wanna fire something up\nhere in Windows 7, I can do it.\n\n406\n00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.770\nI can access everything and\nit works fine, right?\n\n407\n00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.990\nAnd this is my full\noperating system experience.\n\n408\n00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.930\nIt just works like normal.\n\n409\n00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.680\nIt even thinks it has two CPUs when it\nreally doesn't even have a single one.\n\n410\n00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.110\nIt's all sharing what's under the hood,\nright?\n\n411\n00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.630\nSo Type 2 hypervisors are really good for\nstuff like that, just not good for\n\n412\n00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.500\nservers, right?\n\n413\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.880\nSo to fix that, we have what\nare called Type 1 hypervisors.\n\n414\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.400\nNow on the Type 2,\nremember how this stacks up.\n\n415\n00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.680\nMy virtual machines, right, the\napplications running the virtual machines,\n\n416\n00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.820\nthe virtual machines are called guest OSs.\n\n417\n00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.340\nThey run on top of the hypervisor which\nruns on top of the host OS, right, and\n\n418\n00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.090\nthen that is what actually\nruns on the hardware.\n\n419\n00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:46.400\nIn a Type 1 hypervisor,\nit's different, okay?\n\n420\n00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.910\nIt looks like this.\n\n421\n00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.380\nNow you'll notice an immediate\ndifference with that host OS, right?\n\n422\n00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.640\nWhat I've got is my server hardware,\nCPU, RAM, network, disk.\n\n423\n00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.670\nAnd the hypervisor runs right\non top of the hardware.\n\n424\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.710\nIt's called a bare metal hypervisor.\n\n425\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.330\nIt runs right on top of the bare metal,\nthe actual equipment.\n\n426\n00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.650\nIt is basically your\ncore operating system.\n\n427\n00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:14.390\nIt is running on the metal, and\nthen your Host OS Runs on top of\n\n428\n00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:19.420\nthe hypervisor as if it was a virtual\nmachine itself because technically, it is.\n\n429\n00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.900\nAnd then you run your management\nsoftware and so on in your host OS.\n\n430\n00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:28.200\nAnd then as you install your guests, the\nguests run on top of the hypervisor also.\n\n431\n00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.610\nThey all run directly on\ntop of the hypervisor, and\n\n432\n00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.219\nthe hypervisor has direct\naccess to the hardware.\n\n433\n00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:40.000\nThe big difference here,\nis that instead of the guests calling\n\n434\n00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.269\nfake hardware, a lot of times\nthey call the real hardware.\n\n435\n00:20:45.269 --> 00:20:48.874\nThey call the real memory, they call the\nreal CPU, they send those instructions to\n\n436\n00:20:48.874 --> 00:20:52.080\nthe real hardware, and\nthe hypervisor is not translating.\n\n437\n00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.010\nInstead it's acting like more of a traffic\ncop and saying, you can only have so\n\n438\n00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.400\nmuch CPU access right now cuz\neverybody else needs it too.\n\n439\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.430\nOr you get high priority, you get that\naccess, and it's doling it out, saying,\n\n440\n00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.810\nyes for you, no for you,\nred light, green light, red light,\n\n441\n00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.230\ngreen light, and controlling\npeople's access to that hardware.\n\n442\n00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.300\nThat means these machines can\naccess it very, very quickly.\n\n443\n00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:17.340\nYour host OS, you won't notice that\nit's acting like a virtual machine,\n\n444\n00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.570\ncuz it will perform as if it had\ndirect access to that hardware.\n\n445\n00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:26.090\nIt performs the same, you get wire speeds,\nyou get bare metal speeds, and\n\n446\n00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:31.440\nthis is perfect for production use cuz now\nyou're not taking that performance hit,\n\n447\n00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.690\nyou'll get the access.\n\n448\n00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.040\nNow, some of your hardware\nmight still be virtualized\n\n449\n00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.606\nlike network cards a lot of times.\n\n450\n00:21:37.606 --> 00:21:40.840\nThey're still virtualize those because\nthey have special accelerations they do\n\n451\n00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.600\nto make them work better, right?\n\n452\n00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.660\nSo that does happen, soundcards do it too.\n\n453\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.040\nWe don't normally use\nsoundcards in servers, but\n\n454\n00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.970\nthere'll be ways that they're improving\nperformance to actually make those better.\n\n455\n00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.350\nBut when it comes to disk access,\nyou'll be reading and\n\n456\n00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:56.040\nwriting to the actual disks and getting\ntrue speed without being translated.\n\n457\n00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.830\nThat's a huge improvement.\n\n458\n00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:02.870\nSo type 1 hypervisors from performance\nalone make a huge difference and\n\n459\n00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.060\nthat's what you want.\n\n460\n00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.700\nAll right, the challenge is type 1\nhypervisors aren't really designed to run\n\n461\n00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.460\non workstations,\nthey're designed to run on servers.\n\n462\n00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.660\nSo, like, on my laptop,\n\n463\n00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.390\nI run a Type 2 hypervisor cuz\nI can just run it right here.\n\n464\n00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.320\nBut if I want a Type 1 hypervisor,\n\n465\n00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.620\nI need to have some dedicated hardware\nsomewhere that I can run it on.\n\n466\n00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.050\nI think, even like if I wanted\nto run Hyper-V on here,\n\n467\n00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.030\nI'd have to install Windows\nserver to run Hyper-V.\n\n468\n00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.930\nI couldn't install it right on Mac OS,\nso you'd have to change your base OS.\n\n469\n00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.550\nBut once this is up and running,\nyou get great performance.\n\n470\n00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.870\nWhen you're using Microsoft Azure,\nor using Amazon AWS,\n\n471\n00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:35.830\nyou're using Type 1 hypervisors, right?\n\n472\n00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.260\nSo an example of Type 1 hypervisors\nis Microsoft's Hyper-V,\n\n473\n00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.230\nthere's VMware ESX, right?\n\n474\n00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:45.620\nNot VMware Desktop, or VMware Fusion,\nthose are both Type 2.\n\n475\n00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.850\nVMware ESX, which is part of vSphere.\n\n476\n00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:52.260\nThere's Citrix XenServer, and\nthe Xen open source hypervisor.\n\n477\n00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:56.560\nAnd there's KVM, KVM is what Amazon web\nservices uses, and so that's another one.\n\n478\n00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:02.150\nIt's like kernel virtual machine manager,\nkernel virtual machine, I guess KVM.\n\n479\n00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.207\nNot keyboard, video, mouse.\n\n480\n00:23:03.207 --> 00:23:04.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is what a lot of us think of.\n\n481\n00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:05.150\n>> Very confusing.\n\n482\n00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.060\n>> So those are some examples\nof type 1 hypervisors.\n\n483\n00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.290\nSome are free, some cost money, but\nthey all work on the same principle.\n\n484\n00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.610\nThe hypervisor runs\ndirectly on the hardware.\n\n485\n00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.980\nAnd your OS is your host and your guest.\n\n486\n00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.154\nThey all run on top of that hypervisor,\nversus the type 2 hypervisor where\n\n487\n00:23:20.154 --> 00:23:24.327\nthe host runs on the bare metal, the\nhypervisor runs on top of the host, and\n\n488\n00:23:24.327 --> 00:23:26.597\nthe virtual machines run on top of that.\n\n489\n00:23:26.597 --> 00:23:29.650\nIt's the stacked model\nthat makes it slower.\n\n490\n00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.329\nSo key concepts to understand, and\nmake sure you select the right one for\n\n491\n00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:34.671\nuse in your environment.\n\n492\n00:23:34.671 --> 00:23:38.547\n>> Now Don, because of the way those\nType 1 hypervisors tend to work,\n\n493\n00:23:38.547 --> 00:23:42.967\nwith accessing, giving you actual direct\naccess to things like RAM and CPU,\n\n494\n00:23:42.967 --> 00:23:46.775\nthose machines, the actual,\nphysical machines themselves tend\n\n495\n00:23:46.775 --> 00:23:51.739\nto be loaded with quad-core processors and\n96 gigs of RAM and things of that nature,\n\n496\n00:23:51.739 --> 00:23:56.171\nbecause you understand that we're going\nto be sharing these resources out.\n\n497\n00:23:56.171 --> 00:23:57.525\nTo many computers.\nHow we do that,\n\n498\n00:23:57.525 --> 00:23:59.837\nthat infrastructure consolidation.\n\n499\n00:23:59.837 --> 00:24:02.955\nThat's how Don gets away\nwith taking 225 servers and\n\n500\n00:24:02.955 --> 00:24:05.320\ndropping it down to 125 servers.\n\n501\n00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.710\nMakes it a whole lot nicer\nbecause he just takes one big,\n\n502\n00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:12.350\nbeefy server, stuffs it with a hypervisor\nand a bunch of resources, and then he\n\n503\n00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:16.110\ngives that direct access, gives you the\ngood performance that you're looking for.\n\n504\n00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.610\nWhat else about hypervisors\ndo we need to know?\n\n505\n00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.320\n>> All right.\nNow I mentioned that some of our hardware\n\n506\n00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.650\nis gonna be virtualized, right?\n\n507\n00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:26.410\nEven on a type 1 hypervisor, there's some\nthings that may still be virtualized\n\n508\n00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:29.760\nto improve performance or\nto optimize its access and so on.\n\n509\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.400\nSo when you bring up an operating\nsystem as a virtual machine,\n\n510\n00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.650\nmost everything is gonna look like normal,\nbut\n\n511\n00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.160\nthere are a couple of virtual\ncomponents that might stand out.\n\n512\n00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.580\nSo I just wanna highlight a few of\nthose before we wrap this episode up.\n\n513\n00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.400\nThe key components to remember from this\nepisode are the difference between a type\n\n514\n00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.910\none and a type two hypervisor.\n\n515\n00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:46.870\nThere will be at least one\nquestion on the exam on that.\n\n516\n00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.290\nIt's really important to understand that.\n\n517\n00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:48.940\nAll right.\n\n518\n00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:50.040\nBut on the virtual components,\n\n519\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.650\nlet me just kind of lay out a few\nof the things that you might see.\n\n520\n00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:56.280\nI mentioned how a lot of this\nstuff is all just assigned.\n\n521\n00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.770\nSo here I got this type\ntwo virtual machine.\n\n522\n00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.670\nSo this is Window 7 running on\ntop of a top two hypervisor.\n\n523\n00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:07.020\nAnd I highlighted I see a Network\nadapter and I see some disks.\n\n524\n00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.510\nAnd if I look at my disk drive,\n\n525\n00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:13.490\nnotice it's not a regular hard drive it's\na VMware Virtual SCSI Disk drive right?\n\n526\n00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.510\nSo it thinks that it has a SCSI\ndrive attached to it, but\n\n527\n00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:20.320\nI'm on a laptop that I know for\na fact has a SATA bus on the backend.\n\n528\n00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.560\nBut it's okay, it's just creating a fake\nSCSI bus that this machine is using and\n\n529\n00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.170\nthen we're translating it into\na SATA call on the backend.\n\n530\n00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:32.490\nWhen you create a virtual machine,\nyou'll be able to adjust those settings.\n\n531\n00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.957\nAnd I'm gonna pull up this\nvirtual machine's settings and\n\n532\n00:25:34.957 --> 00:25:36.679\nwe'll run through a few real quick.\n\n533\n00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:42.180\nSo here's the virtual machine settings\nthat you have in VMWare Fusion.\n\n534\n00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.090\nAnd different products\ndo this different ways.\n\n535\n00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:48.040\nSo if you're using VirtualBox,\nit's using one set of settings and so on.\n\n536\n00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:52.785\nBut you can come in here, and see how\nI've got Hard Disk SCSI right here, and\n\n537\n00:25:52.785 --> 00:25:54.620\nCD/DVD SATA?\n\n538\n00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.080\nSo you can come in and\nstart to add resources to it.\n\n539\n00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:02.450\nAnd if I go up here to Add Device, I'll\nsee some of the devices that I can add.\n\n540\n00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:06.580\nI can add network adapters, CD drives,\nhard drives, cameras, floppy drives,\n\n541\n00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.810\nserial ports, parallel ports, right.\n\n542\n00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.540\nAll different hardware I can attach.\n\n543\n00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.120\nAnd if I do something like a hard drive,\nright, I'm gonna come in here and\n\n544\n00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.080\nattach a hard drive.\n\n545\n00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.470\nShoot, my system's powered on.\n\n546\n00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.050\nLet me power this thing off.\n\n547\n00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.740\nOr, actually, let me take another virtual\nmachine that I've got sitting around.\n\n548\n00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.620\nLet's see.\n\n549\n00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.700\nDo I have.\nWhere is my.\n\n550\n00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.520\nWell shoot.\n\n551\n00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.720\nYeah, let me bounce around here.\n\n552\n00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.600\nSo, let me get out of\nthis virtual machine, and\n\n553\n00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.620\nI'll show you on a different one.\n\n554\n00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.140\nWhen they're turned on,\nit goes back to that\n\n555\n00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.950\nif you have a computer that's turned on,\ncan you add hard drives to it?\n\n556\n00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:37.830\nNot normally.\n\n557\n00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.000\nMaybe it's got hot plug, I don't know.\n\n558\n00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.410\nYou can't add RAM to it, right.\n\n559\n00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.310\nAnd that's effectively what\nI'm trying to do right here.\n\n560\n00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.970\nSo let me go to my\nvirtual machine library.\n\n561\n00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.900\n>> Now Don this is the virtual\nmachine management software that\n\n562\n00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.040\nwe're looking at now,\nthat's the VM Fusion stuff.\n\n563\n00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.890\n>> Yes, yep, so\nthis is VM Fusion's management software.\n\n564\n00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.770\nAgain, different products have\ndifferent management software.\n\n565\n00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.520\nI think I have VirtualBox running\nin the background somewhere,\n\n566\n00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.740\nwell that's an actual server there.\n\n567\n00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.660\nBut you'll find where different products\nhave different management software that\n\n568\n00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.950\nyou can use and it's all just baked\ndown to what their preference is.\n\n569\n00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.690\nBut let's take one of\nthese virtual machines.\n\n570\n00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.760\nI'll take this CentoS box\nthat I've got right here.\n\n571\n00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.490\nSo I've got a CentoS Linux machine,\nand if I go into it's settings,\n\n572\n00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.740\nI can start to customize it's hardware and\nif I go under processors and\n\n573\n00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.720\nmemory, see how I can\nadjust the processor cores.\n\n574\n00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.420\nRight?\nMy system has four cores.\n\n575\n00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.900\nSo I can go up to four cores\nin this virtual machine.\n\n576\n00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.800\nBut I'm holding it at two.\n\n577\n00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.960\nAnd I'm doing that cuz I don't wanna\noverburden the system underneath, or\n\n578\n00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.390\nI wanna share with other VMs.\n\n579\n00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.770\nI can set how much memory\nI want it to have.\n\n580\n00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.530\nYou can tweak some really\ninteresting things.\n\n581\n00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.890\nOn the display side I can set\nthe memory for the video card, and\n\n582\n00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.230\nwhether I wanna support 3D acceleration.\n\n583\n00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.070\nSo, you could dictate those things.\n\n584\n00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:50.790\nBut if I go to add device, and oops,\nand I want to add a hard drive,\n\n585\n00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.190\nso I'm gonna add a new hard disk.\n\n586\n00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:56.790\nWhen I go to add it, it's gonna ask some\nbasic questions here like what do I wanna\n\n587\n00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.990\nname the file, because the hard drive\nis actually been stored as a file and\n\n588\n00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.440\nwhat size I wanted it to be.\n\n589\n00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.510\nBut if I go under Advanced,\n\n590\n00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.510\nyou can pick other things like what\nbus type do I want it to have.\n\n591\n00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.440\nDo I want it to be SCSI, IDE, SATA?\n\n592\n00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.660\nWhat do I want the machine to see it?\n\n593\n00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.810\nAnd it's picking SCSI because VMware\nFusion has some SCSI optimizations in it.\n\n594\n00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.750\nYou're software may not, your software\nmay prefer SATA and may prefer IDE.\n\n595\n00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:21.650\nDoesn't matter that IDE's old.\n\n596\n00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:22.870\nIt's virtual software anyway.\n\n597\n00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.260\nYou might get faster\nperformance out of it.\n\n598\n00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.660\nSo you pick whichever one is appropriate.\n\n599\n00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.640\nThese are key components cuz this\nis part of a virtual system.\n\n600\n00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.750\nOn the network side,\nyou'll have the same thing.\n\n601\n00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:37.290\nRight?\nIf I go back to Add Device, and\n\n602\n00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.190\nchoose to add a network adapter.\n\n603\n00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:42.460\nThere's all sorts of settings that\npertain to a network adapter when we\n\n604\n00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.720\nadd it to a system.\n\n605\n00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.040\nAnd so here it's asking me\nwhat do I wanna connect it to.\n\n606\n00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.600\nDo I wanna connect it to one of\nmy physical network adapters, or\n\n607\n00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.900\ndo I wanna make this one as part of\na virtual network or an isolated network?\n\n608\n00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.350\nI've got Advanced Options where I can\nset what I want the MAC Address to be.\n\n609\n00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:02.000\nAnd you'll see other options in other\nsystems, mine doesn't support it but\n\n610\n00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.400\nyou may see where you can define VLANs.\n\n611\n00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.200\nYou might have VLANs in\nplace on your network and\n\n612\n00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.520\nsee you can save this Network Adapter\nis connected to these other ones.\n\n613\n00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.380\nSo virtual NICs, virtual Network\nInterface Cards, Virtual HBAs, right,\n\n614\n00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.120\nthat's a Virtual Host Bus Adapter.\n\n615\n00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.840\nA virtual HBA we would use if we were\nconnecting to a SAN or an iSCSI system,\n\n616\n00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.040\nthose might be something we add in.\n\n617\n00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.080\nEven things like a virtual router, right?\n\n618\n00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:29.390\nSorry, I'm gonna give everybody a seizure.\n\n619\n00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:32.120\nSo for example,\nI mentioned networking, right?\n\n620\n00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.430\nIn VMware Fusion,\nif we go into our preferences you'll see\n\n621\n00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:41.180\nwhere you've got this network section\nhere and I can create virtual networks.\n\n622\n00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.150\nAnd I can see where I created\nseveral of them right here.\n\n623\n00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:46.330\nAnd when I create these, see how it's got,\n\n624\n00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:50.330\nallow virtual machines on this network to\nconnect to external networks using NAT,\n\n625\n00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.620\nand connect this host to the Mac and\nso on?\n\n626\n00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:56.650\nWhat this is doing is creating a virtual\nrouter, so that when systems pull in,\n\n627\n00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.670\nthey'll get an IP address\nin this range right here.\n\n628\n00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.980\nAnd then once they're\nconnected to that range,\n\n629\n00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:07.000\nthey can use VMware Fusion as a router\nto be able to get out the Internet and\n\n630\n00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.980\naccess it all behind a NATed IP,\nthe IP of my laptop.\n\n631\n00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.440\nSo that kind of functionality is neat,\nthat you've got virtual network cards,\n\n632\n00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.860\nvirtual HPAs, virtual routers, all kind\nof functionality provided by this.\n\n633\n00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.840\nAnd here it's in a type 2 hypervisor.\n\n634\n00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.650\nType 1 hypervisors have this too,\n\n635\n00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:26.200\nit's just the configuration screen is\nreally the same once you get in there,\n\n636\n00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.410\nit's the underlying\ninfrastructure that's different.\n\n637\n00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.360\nAll right.\nSome of the other things that I talked\n\n638\n00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.170\nabout, shared memory, I talked about\nvirtual CPUs, shared storage, and\n\n639\n00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.120\nclustered storage, right?\n\n640\n00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.290\nI don't have shared storage,\nor clustered storage here, but\n\n641\n00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:44.420\nwhen you go to add a virtual hard drive,\nthey just show up as physical hard drive.\n\n642\n00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.700\nYou place your file on that shared\nstorage and your in business.\n\n643\n00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:54.170\nSo, for example, if I were to go back\nto adding hardware to this node,\n\n644\n00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:58.750\nwhere I would go into the settings and\ngo up to add device.\n\n645\n00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:04.410\nWhen I go to add that disk I would just\nplace the disk on that shared storage.\n\n646\n00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:08.076\nThe file name here is defaulting to one\nlocation ,and I might want to move that to\n\n647\n00:31:08.076 --> 00:31:11.484\nwherever my shared storage is,\nit's already attached to this machine.\n\n648\n00:31:11.484 --> 00:31:13.803\nAnd that's critical if we have\nsomething like a cluster,\n\n649\n00:31:13.803 --> 00:31:15.460\nthat we needed that redundancy.\n\n650\n00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.530\nWhen you go with Azure or Amazon AWS, they\ntake care of all this stuff for you so\n\n651\n00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:20.720\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n652\n00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.770\nBut, when you're managing it yourself\nin a private cloud you've got to\n\n653\n00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.030\nremember to specify this.\n\n654\n00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:31.130\nOne last thing that I want to mention, is\nthat when you deal with SANs, I mentioned\n\n655\n00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:37.812\nhow with a SAN you can have more than\none physical server accessing the SAN.\n\n656\n00:31:37.812 --> 00:31:42.100\nAll right, I might have a virtual machine\nthat's up and running on server one.\n\n657\n00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.420\nAnd its virtual hard drive I store,\non the shared storage.\n\n658\n00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.265\nRight?\nAnd that way, if I ever need to,\n\n659\n00:31:48.265 --> 00:31:52.921\nI can move that virtual machine\nfrom Server 1 to Server 2.\n\n660\n00:31:52.921 --> 00:31:54.398\nIf I have a physical server failure or\n\n661\n00:31:54.398 --> 00:31:56.838\nif I just need to take this\nserver down to do updates, right.\n\n662\n00:31:56.838 --> 00:32:00.260\nSo some new update comes out for\nVMware ESX I wanna apply it.\n\n663\n00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.520\nI could move the virtual machines\noff somewhere else, right.\n\n664\n00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.030\nBut as long as I'm storing\nthat drive here there's risk\n\n665\n00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.350\nthat somebody else could access it and\ndamage it, right.\n\n666\n00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:12.480\nSo it's up to our software\nto protect us from that.\n\n667\n00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.950\nAnd if you're running Microsoft Hyper-V\nin a failover cluster,\n\n668\n00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:17.200\nit protects you from that.\n\n669\n00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.730\nAnd if you're running VMware ESX in\na cluster, it protects you from that.\n\n670\n00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.940\nIt knows it.\nIf you've got Citrix XenServer in a pool,\n\n671\n00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.150\nit protects you from that.\n\n672\n00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:29.070\nIt knows that this is shared storage and\nit'll protect you.\n\n673\n00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:33.840\nBut not every system does and so\nin some systems they don't rely on\n\n674\n00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.250\nthe operating system underneath,\nthey rely on other things to do it.\n\n675\n00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:41.010\nAnd one that might turn up ion the exam\nfor the most part they're not gonna get to\n\n676\n00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:45.012\nnitty gritty on this stuff but\nthere's something called a NPIV, right.\n\n677\n00:32:45.012 --> 00:32:49.802\nAnd a NPIV,\nit's a N_Port ID virtualization.\n\n678\n00:32:49.802 --> 00:32:51.338\nAnd what happens is on a SAN,\n\n679\n00:32:51.338 --> 00:32:54.540\nyou can define something called\na world wide name, right.\n\n680\n00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:59.652\nAnd a World Wide Name, a WWN, or\nin this case it would actually be\n\n681\n00:32:59.652 --> 00:33:06.130\na world wide port name, WWPN,\nyou can define who is allowed to see what.\n\n682\n00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:10.370\nSo this port, the HBA for\nServer 1 will have a port id, right.\n\n683\n00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:11.800\nIt's kinda like a MAC address.\n\n684\n00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.320\nIt's just an identifier.\n\n685\n00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.665\nAnd on the SAN, it can identify that id,\nthat port id, and\n\n686\n00:33:17.665 --> 00:33:20.522\nit can tie it to a world wide port name.\n\n687\n00:33:20.522 --> 00:33:23.941\nWhere usually you have\na SAN switch in between.\n\n688\n00:33:23.941 --> 00:33:25.760\nIts the switch doing this,\nbut the SAN can do it also.\n\n689\n00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.170\nAnd it says, hey, this identifier\nis allowed to access these disks.\n\n690\n00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.910\nAnd so it might give it access to\njust this first virtual disk, right.\n\n691\n00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:36.520\nWell that's cool, because if I ever unplug\nthis server and plug it into a different\n\n692\n00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.380\nport, it still has the same ID, and it'll\nstill be able to access that virtual disk.\n\n693\n00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.190\nAnd nobody else will be able to access it,\n\n694\n00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:43.810\nbecause they don't have the same ID as me,\nright.\n\n695\n00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.440\nSo it gives us that protection.\n\n696\n00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:51.070\nBut if this server fails Nobody\nelse can access that, right.\n\n697\n00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:57.830\nSo what NPIV does is it allows each\nserver to have more than one ID.\n\n698\n00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:01.990\nAnd so I could give Server 1 the IDs for\nall three servers.\n\n699\n00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:04.030\nAnd Server 2 could have the IDs for\nall three servers.\n\n700\n00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:05.930\nAnd Server 3 could have the IDs for\nall three servers.\n\n701\n00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.390\nBut they only go active for one.\n\n702\n00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:10.310\nServer 1 might just go active for\nServer 1.\n\n703\n00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.790\nAnd Server 2 goes active for Server 2,\nServer 3 goes active for Server 3.\n\n704\n00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:18.730\nBut if Server 3 fails, one of these\nother guys could choose to go active for\n\n705\n00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:21.960\nboth themselves and Server 3.\n\n706\n00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.560\nAnd that way, they're able to\naccess Server 3 storage and\n\n707\n00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.160\npower up those VMs and\nkeep us online in a server failure.\n\n708\n00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.700\nAnd they do that by virtualizing the ID.\n\n709\n00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.445\nAnd that's NPIV.\n\n710\n00:34:31.445 --> 00:34:37.000\nN_Port, that's N underscore Port,\nN_Port ID virtualization.\n\n711\n00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.680\nAnd with NPIV, we just need to\nmake sure we set those IDs.\n\n712\n00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.220\nIf you're running VMware, VMware ESX,\n\n713\n00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.880\nif you're running Hyper-V,\nthey do this automatically.\n\n714\n00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.030\nYou don't even worry about it,\nright, it's just done.\n\n715\n00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:51.140\nBut your software might require you to\nconfigure that, and what you would have\n\n716\n00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:55.830\nto do is, on each of these servers,\nyou would have to go and get their ID, and\n\n717\n00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:59.040\nyou'd find it in the settings for\nwhatever your virtualization platform was.\n\n718\n00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.810\nAnd then, whenever you created a new\nhypervisor, when you install that\n\n719\n00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:07.670\nhypervisor on the system, You would\nprovide it its ID, or autogenerate it, and\n\n720\n00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.570\nyou'd add the ID's for the other hosts,\nyou'd need to punch those in, all right.\n\n721\n00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:13.650\nNow on the exam, they don't want\nyou to know how to configure that,\n\n722\n00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:15.340\nthey just want you to be\naware of that concept.\n\n723\n00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.930\nAnd these NPIV's are important for\nfiltering that access, all right.\n\n724\n00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.230\nBut you'll see that most products\nactually do it automatically and\n\n725\n00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:22.280\nwe don't have to sweat it, right.\n\n726\n00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.780\nAnd when you're dealing with a type 2\nhypervisor, that's where you'd really see\n\n727\n00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:30.400\nit, because they're not necessarily\naware of all the little ins and outs.\n\n728\n00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.090\nAnd so\nwhen you start to work with them you may\n\n729\n00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:34.570\nhave to provide some additional settings.\n\n730\n00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:40.750\nSo when you go in here and you start\nsetting up like here's VMware Fusion.\n\n731\n00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:44.520\nIf I go back into my preferences,\nyou may have some storage options in\n\n732\n00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.920\nhere where you have to indicate\nwhether NPIV is supported and\n\n733\n00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.620\nwhat those additional IDs are.\n\n734\n00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.380\nAnd you'll see here, I don't have that.\n\n735\n00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.470\nAs I look under it, I just have\nmy regular systems and that's it.\n\n736\n00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.230\nYour software may have NPIV.\n\n737\n00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:01.150\n>> Awesome stuff, well obviously\nwe've learned a lot about well, a,\n\n738\n00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.390\nthe benefits of virtualization\nof our infrastructure.\n\n739\n00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.030\nWe've talked about the different\nhypervisors and the difference between\n\n740\n00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:10.700\nthe two that you're gonna see and\nthe virtual components as well.\n\n741\n00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.680\nDon, is there anything else that\nwe need to cover in this episode?\n\n742\n00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.830\n>> Just remember,\ntype one hypervisor, good, fast,\n\n743\n00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:21.490\ntype two hypervisor, mediocre, slow,\nbut still great for dev and test.\n\n744\n00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:24.970\nThere's a place for each of these, we just\nneed to understand that and remember it.\n\n745\n00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:28.090\n>> It's confusing, because you'd\nthink type one would be older,\n\n746\n00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:29.080\ntype two would be newer.\n\n747\n00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.280\nBut type one is the newer,\nit's the better.\n\n748\n00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.110\nType two is the older,\nand it's the slower.\n\n749\n00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:33.920\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n750\n00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.910\nWell Don, thank you so much for\nexplaining this to us.\n\n751\n00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:37.780\nI know this can be a little cryptic.\n\n752\n00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:41.260\nIf you're new to this, it can seem\nlike you're drinking from a fire hose,\n\n753\n00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.620\nbut you'll get it.\n\n754\n00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.040\nIt will come to you, we promise.\n\n755\n00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.680\nJust watch these episodes\nas many times as necessary,\n\n756\n00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.130\nuntil that information\nassimilates into the old brain.\n\n757\n00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:50.660\nAgain, Don, thank you for joining us.\n\n758\n00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.200\nWe thank our audience for watching.\n\n759\n00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.300\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n760\n00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.610\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n761\n00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.240\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n762\n00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.697\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n763\n00:36:59.697 --> 00:37:06.420\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:19.004\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:22.350\nwe're continuing on with our\nCloud Plus series for CompTIA.\n\n5\n00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.220\nHopefully you guys are enjoying us so\nfar and\n\n6\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.590\nI know you're gonna enjoy this cuz back\nwith us in the studios today is the man,\n\n7\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.470\nthe myth, the legend, that is Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.530\nDon, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.720\nHow you doing today, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.700\n>> I'm doing great, Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.120\nReady to jump back in to Cloud Plus and\n\n12\n00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.870\nthis is the episode I know a lot\nof you guys have been waiting for.\n\n13\n00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.640\nWe got a couple of episodes under\nour belt so far for Cloud Plus.\n\n14\n00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.200\nAnd we've been talking about concepts and\ntheory.\n\n15\n00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.095\nAnd you might have noticed that we've\nkinda yet to virtualize anything.\n\n16\n00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:49.692\n[LAUGH] We haven't really created\na virtual machine yet and\n\n17\n00:00:49.692 --> 00:00:53.091\nthat's because we had all those concepts\nthat we had to get thorough first.\n\n18\n00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:55.398\nNow it's time to actually do some work.\n\n19\n00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:59.002\nSo I wanna get in here and walk you though\nthe process of creating a virtual machine\n\n20\n00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.659\nand some of the different decisions that\nwe have to make, especially when it comes\n\n21\n00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.224\nto our hardware and the resources that\nare available on our system, all right?\n\n22\n00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:07.511\nIt is all pretty important.\n\n23\n00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:09.601\nSo that's what we're gonna be taking\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n24\n00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:10.270\n>> That's right.\n\n25\n00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.280\nIf you can't create a virtual machine,\n\n26\n00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.170\nthen what good is all this virtualization,\nright?\n\n27\n00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.140\nWe gotta be able to do that.\n\n28\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.480\nWe gotta understand\neverything that we need.\n\n29\n00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.250\nAnd all the foundation we've gotten there,\nwe're now finally at the point where\n\n30\n00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.280\nwe're gonna put the money where our mouth\nis and actually create this environment.\n\n31\n00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.056\nAnd Don, I guess a good\nplace to start is the actual\n\n32\n00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:33.080\nphysical requirements of these machines\ncuz even though they're virtualized,\n\n33\n00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.670\nthey still have to actually call up on\nCPU and RAM and other hardware, right?\n\n34\n00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.390\n>> Right, exactly and let's just start\nwith CPU and we'll kinda go from there and\n\n35\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.990\ntackle some of the other things.\n\n36\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.420\nIn the last episode we talked a little\nbit about the difference between\n\n37\n00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.190\na type one hypervisor and\na type two hypervisor.\n\n38\n00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.100\nAnd if you watched that one, actually I\nmight even have my diagrams pulled up.\n\n39\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.717\nI certainly do.\n\n40\n00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:54.136\nIt's almost like I'm prepared.\n\n41\n00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:56.338\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, sort of prepared.\n\n42\n00:01:56.338 --> 00:01:57.940\nIt depends on how we wanna define that.\n\n43\n00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.450\nBut I talked about how a Type 1\nHypervisor, that's the good one, right?\n\n44\n00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.800\nThat's where the Hypervisor runs right\non top of our bare metal hardware\n\n45\n00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.950\nversus a Type 2 Hypervisor\nwhich is not as good.\n\n46\n00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.260\nThe hypervisor runs on top of\nyour operating system, right?\n\n47\n00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.830\nWell a Type 2 Hypervisor,\nyou can run that anywhere, right?\n\n48\n00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.230\nYou can run those on pretty much\nany operating system you want.\n\n49\n00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.990\nIf you have Mac OS,\nif you have Windows, if you have Linux.\n\n50\n00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.740\nYou can find a Type 2\nHypervisor that'll run for you.\n\n51\n00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.530\nSo for example, in the Windows world,\nwell, there's Oracle Virtual Box.\n\n52\n00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.330\nThat darn thing, it'll run Linux,\nMac OS, runs everywhere.\n\n53\n00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.110\nIt's a great product.\n\n54\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.000\nI use it all the time, really wonderful.\n\n55\n00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.918\nBut then there's VMWare Fusion, that\nonly runs on a Mac or Parallels Desktop,\n\n56\n00:02:39.918 --> 00:02:41.750\nthat only runs on a Mac.\n\n57\n00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.510\nThen you have VMware Workstation,\nthat only runs on Windows.\n\n58\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.547\nAnd VMware Player.\n\n59\n00:02:46.547 --> 00:02:48.342\nActually I think Player,\nI know Player's on Windows.\n\n60\n00:02:48.342 --> 00:02:49.512\nIs it on Mac now?\n\n61\n00:02:49.512 --> 00:02:52.337\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I want to say that it will run on both,\n\n62\n00:02:52.337 --> 00:02:53.380\nbut don't quote me.\n\n63\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.923\n>> There's several different\nproducts that are out there.\n\n64\n00:02:55.923 --> 00:02:57.343\nThose are just a couple.\n\n65\n00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.796\nAnd depending on your operating system,\nyou may or\n\n66\n00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:01.973\nmay not have all the same\nones to choose from.\n\n67\n00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:02.628\nExcept Virtual Box.\n\n68\n00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:03.540\nIt's pretty much everywhere.\n\n69\n00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.480\nSo you can pick that, you can install it.\n\n70\n00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.420\nYou really don't have to worry\nabout your hardware too much.\n\n71\n00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.285\nBut if you want a Type 1 Hypervisor,\nType 1 Hypervisor's are trickier.\n\n72\n00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:17.930\nYour hypervisor is directly\ncommunicating with the hardware.\n\n73\n00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.865\nAnd that means your hardware has\nto be ready to accept that and\n\n74\n00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:23.262\nnot all hardware is.\n\n75\n00:03:23.262 --> 00:03:28.231\nWhen you have a CPU, your processor is\ngenerally expecting instructions only\n\n76\n00:03:28.231 --> 00:03:31.172\nfrom one operating system,\nfrom one kernel.\n\n77\n00:03:31.172 --> 00:03:34.632\nBut when you're running a Hypervisor,\ntechnically you're getting operations\n\n78\n00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:38.400\ncoming from more than one OS and most\nCPUs just aren't geared to handle that.\n\n79\n00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.172\nSo, they handle it slowly, they do one at\na time, things kinda move through it and\n\n80\n00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:45.230\nthey don't take advantage\nof their full feature set.\n\n81\n00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.510\nSo years ago now,\nit feels like its been ten years.\n\n82\n00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.140\nMaybe not that long.\n\n83\n00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.730\nAMD and Intel started releasing\nenhanced feature sets for\n\n84\n00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.530\ntheir processors to support\nType 1 Hypervisors.\n\n85\n00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.390\nAnd they kinda have different names for\nit.\n\n86\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.060\nWith AMD it was called the AMD-V.\n\n87\n00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.110\nAnd with Intel they called it VT-x,\nor the Virtual Technology Extensions.\n\n88\n00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.370\nAnd they were add ons to the physical CPUs\nthat would enhance they're capabilities\n\n89\n00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.690\nand make them support a Type 1 Hypervisor.\n\n90\n00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.650\nIf you don't have Virtualization\nExtensions built in to your CPU,\n\n91\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.670\nthen you can't run a Type 1 Hypervisor.\n\n92\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.940\nSo when you buy a server, when you go\nto Dell or HP or Lenovo or whoever, and\n\n93\n00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.240\nyou go to buy that server,\n\n94\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.780\nyou need to make sure the CPUs support\nvirtualization extensions, all right?\n\n95\n00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.017\nNow, pretty much all the processors and\nservers do these days.\n\n96\n00:04:33.017 --> 00:04:34.385\nBut if you're building your own,\nyou can be at risk.\n\n97\n00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:36.882\nOr if you're dealing with servers you\nalready have, you can be at risk.\n\n98\n00:04:36.882 --> 00:04:38.975\nThere are still plenty that are sold\ntoday that don't support it.\n\n99\n00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:44.400\nAnd if you're doing this on your own\ndesktop, your laptop or even a desktop PC.\n\n100\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.000\nA lot of them don't have virtualization\nextensions cuz they don't need to\n\n101\n00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.440\nanticipate you running VMs\non your personal laptop.\n\n102\n00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.010\nBut if you're an IT guy, Daniel and\nI, we do it every day so\n\n103\n00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.780\nwe need that in our hardware.\n\n104\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.714\nSo one of the first things we need to be\naware of is we're gonna do virtualization,\n\n105\n00:04:58.714 --> 00:05:02.704\nwe need to know whether our hardware\nsupports it, on a server, desktop, laptop,\n\n106\n00:05:02.704 --> 00:05:04.426\ndoesn't matter, we need to know.\n\n107\n00:05:04.426 --> 00:05:09.716\nSo for example here on laptop,\nif I take a look at mine,\n\n108\n00:05:09.716 --> 00:05:16.507\nI can see that my laptop has\na Intel Core i7 2.8 GHz CPU, all right?\n\n109\n00:05:16.507 --> 00:05:20.416\nThat's not a whole heck of a lot detail\ninformation there, so I know its\n\n110\n00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:24.601\nan Intel Core i7 but I really need to\nknow a model number for that processor.\n\n111\n00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:25.922\nAnd Mac OS, they actually,\n\n112\n00:05:25.922 --> 00:05:29.016\nit's kind of buried away in here\nsomewhere where I can't find it.\n\n113\n00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:30.389\n>> [CROSSTALK] System Report, maybe.\n\n114\n00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.184\n>> Yeah, there's a system utility.\n\n115\n00:05:32.184 --> 00:05:33.876\n>> It was right there on that screen,\nI think.\n\n116\n00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:35.008\n>> Was it?\n>> Yeah.\n\n117\n00:05:35.008 --> 00:05:37.431\n>> [LAUGH] I guess if I paid\na little more attention.\n\n118\n00:05:37.431 --> 00:05:38.672\nShoot.\nNow I'm just gonna go all over the place.\n\n119\n00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:39.672\n>> Now you've done it, Don.\n\n120\n00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:41.514\n>> In Windows, it's easy, you just pull\nup the properties of your machine.\n\n121\n00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:42.341\n>> Right there, System Report.\n\n122\n00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:43.716\n>> Go to System Report.\n\n123\n00:05:43.716 --> 00:05:47.016\nAnd then Intel Core i7,\nit doesn't actually go in and\n\n124\n00:05:47.016 --> 00:05:48.910\ngive me the full model number.\n\n125\n00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.550\nI'm sure it's buried in here\nsomewhere in all this stuff.\n\n126\n00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.440\nBut just using Windows or Linux as an\nexample, you can take a Windows machine,\n\n127\n00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.170\nlike here, I'll take this server.\n\n128\n00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.420\nAnd if I just right-click on this PC and\ngo to Properties, it's really transparent\n\n129\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:10.400\nabout it, and see how it tells me here\nI've got an Intel Core i7-4558U, right?\n\n130\n00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.590\nThe exact model number for my CPU.\n\n131\n00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.410\nThat's what I need.\n\n132\n00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.880\nI need that CPU number.\n\n133\n00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.680\nNow, if you can't find it in your OS,\nthere's a program out there called\n\n134\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.240\nCPUz and it's a freeware program, you can\ndownload it, install it, and run it and\n\n135\n00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.000\nit'll tell you what model your CPU is.\n\n136\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.470\nAnd it'll tell you whether you have\nvirtualization extensions on it.\n\n137\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.260\nIt'll tell you whether\nyou have 64-bit support.\n\n138\n00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.980\nAll those things you kinda need to\nhave a good Type 1 Hypervisor running.\n\n139\n00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.678\nBut if I just have the model number for\nmy CPU, that's enough.\n\n140\n00:06:38.678 --> 00:06:40.229\nI can take that model number and\n\n141\n00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.683\nI can look it up on Intel's\nwebsite in this case.\n\n142\n00:06:42.683 --> 00:06:46.051\nI've got an Intel i7-4558U.\n\n143\n00:06:46.051 --> 00:06:51.805\nSo if I just do a Google search,\nlet me get to my web browser here,\n\n144\n00:06:51.805 --> 00:06:57.254\nand do a search for an Intel i7 and\nI've already forgotten.\n\n145\n00:06:57.254 --> 00:06:58.423\n[LAUGH] It was a.\n\n146\n00:06:58.423 --> 00:07:00.638\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> 455AU.\n\n147\n00:07:00.638 --> 00:07:03.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It happened more than two seconds ago.\n\n148\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.040\nWe can look it up and\nIntel has this great website.\n\n149\n00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.740\nIt's the ark, A-R-K, .intel.com website,\n\n150\n00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.640\nwhere they put all the specifications for\nevery one of their processors.\n\n151\n00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.159\nAnd so we can jump into that.\n\n152\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.850\nAnd it'll tell me all about my CPU.\n\n153\n00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.500\nSo here's what I've got, I've got 4M of\nCache, up to 3.30 GHz performance and\n\n154\n00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.500\nstarts kinda laying it out.\n\n155\n00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.670\nAnd what I'm looking for\nare the virtualization extensions.\n\n156\n00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.830\nAnd so if I keep scrolling down here,\neventually I'll find it.\n\n157\n00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.980\nAt least I better find it,\notherwise it's not gonna work, right?\n\n158\n00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.840\nBut I can find it in here somewhere\nwhere I'll have, here it is, right here.\n\n159\n00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.430\nIntel Virtualization Technologies,\nTV-x and I've got a nice big yes.\n\n160\n00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.826\nOkay, if that's a no, then I'm outta luck,\nI can't run a Type 1 hypervisor.\n\n161\n00:07:48.826 --> 00:07:50.916\nI'm gonna have to use a Type 2.\n\n162\n00:07:50.916 --> 00:07:54.281\nYou can always run a Type 2 cuz a Type\n2 is entirely done in software.\n\n163\n00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:56.603\nI've talked about that earlier,\nit's why you get poor performance.\n\n164\n00:07:56.603 --> 00:07:58.833\nBut a type one,\nwe need hardware acceleration.\n\n165\n00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:01.850\nWe need to work together with the hardware\nand we've got to have these extensions.\n\n166\n00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.950\nRemember, Intel calls it VT-x,\nAMD calls it AMDV,\n\n167\n00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.870\nwith AMD it's built into the CPU and\nit's always on.\n\n168\n00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.720\nWith Intel, it's built into the CPU,\nbut it can usually be turned on and\n\n169\n00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.500\noff in Bios, right?\n\n170\n00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.760\nSo if you go into the Bios, UEFI Bios or\nyour regular Bios, you can go in there and\n\n171\n00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.970\nyou can flip the switch on and off.\n\n172\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.590\nWe have a bunch of desktops here at the\noffice where you have to turn it on and\n\n173\n00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.950\noff, and some of our Dell PowerEdge\nservers are like that.\n\n174\n00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.260\nYou can turn it on and off.\n\n175\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.060\nThis laptop, though,\nI've got an Apple laptop, and\n\n176\n00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.670\nApple just turns that on automatically and\nI can't turn it off.\n\n177\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.260\nApple doesn't let you get into your BIOS,\nright, cuz that would be crazy.\n\n178\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:36.930\n>> You had to go there, Don.\n\n179\n00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.135\n>> Imagine the things you could do.\n\n180\n00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:39.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wouldn't be magic.\n\n181\n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.700\nSo anyhow, so\nit's always turned on on my laptop.\n\n182\n00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.080\nBut you don't necessarily know for\nyour equipment, right?\n\n183\n00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.630\nSo, for your servers, for your desktop,\nyou've gotta do that research ahead of\n\n184\n00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.200\ntime to make sure you can\nsupport a type one hypervisor.\n\n185\n00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.960\nNow, notice there's a few other things in\nhere, Intel Virtualization Technology for\n\n186\n00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.540\ndirected IO,\nwhich is sometimes called VTD, and\n\n187\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.340\nIntel VT-x with extended page tables or\nEPT.\n\n188\n00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.310\nWhat the heck is this all about, right?\n\n189\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.310\nWell, VT-x was a technology that allowed\n\n190\n00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.550\nvirtual machines to access\nthe CPU's full feature set.\n\n191\n00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.630\nSo they could really interact\nwith that CPU faster.\n\n192\n00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.190\nBut what about RAM?\n\n193\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.890\nWhat about being able to access\nfull feature sets of RAM, and\n\n194\n00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.490\neven large chunks of RAM?\n\n195\n00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.070\nWell, that's where the extended\npage tables comes in, in EPT.\n\n196\n00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:26.410\nAnd then you've got the VTD,\nwhich is storage, allowing you to\n\n197\n00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.750\ndirect access hard drives at wire speed,\nwithout having to go through translations.\n\n198\n00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.450\nEach one of these are different\naccelerations, right?\n\n199\n00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.520\nType one hypervisors will\ngenerally require VT-x or AMDV.\n\n200\n00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.300\nYou have to have that.\n\n201\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.540\nBut the other features\nhere are kind of optional.\n\n202\n00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.680\nIf you have them, it's gonna help.\n\n203\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.830\nIt's gonna make your performance better.\n\n204\n00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.440\nSo, get them if you can.\n\n205\n00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.100\nIf you don't have them,\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n206\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.020\nYou can still virtualize.\n\n207\n00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.230\nYou just can't take\nadvantage of everything.\n\n208\n00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.540\nAnd you're starting to\nsee things like Hyper-V.\n\n209\n00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.310\nIf you have Windows 10 and\nyou run Hyper-V,\n\n210\n00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.790\nit requires the extended page tables.\n\n211\n00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.320\nRight?\n\n212\n00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.610\nIt actually refers to another technology,\n\n213\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.640\nSLAT, Second Level Address Translation,\nwhich is an advanced feature.\n\n214\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.500\nIt's kind of part of this\nextended page tables.\n\n215\n00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.670\nAnd it allows them to do some extra things\nwith addressing memory inside of Hyper-V.\n\n216\n00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.750\nAnd on Windows 10, if you don't\nhave that it won't let you run it.\n\n217\n00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.890\nYou can install Hyper-V but\nit won't run any VMs.\n\n218\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.310\nSo they actually require\na little bit extra.\n\n219\n00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.950\nBut VMWare ESX, Citrix ZenServer,\n\n220\n00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:28.810\nKVM, those guys, they just require\nthe base technology, and the other stuff,\n\n221\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.770\nif you have it they'll use it, and if you\ndon't have it they get over it, right?\n\n222\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.710\nSo be aware that that's\nin your physical CPU.\n\n223\n00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.110\nNow, what if my CPU doesn't have it?\n\n224\n00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.930\nCan I just go and\nbuy a new CPU and swap it out?\n\n225\n00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.870\nWell, all right, so\nI'm in Apple's world garden.\n\n226\n00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.950\nWhat's that process, Daniel?\n\n227\n00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.132\n>> No.\n[LAUGH] You're not doing anything cuz\n\n228\n00:10:47.132 --> 00:10:48.740\neverything's hard side.\n\n229\n00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.280\nThey don't want you opening\nthis thing up at all.\n\n230\n00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.730\n>> Now in their defense,\nyou certainly can.\n\n231\n00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:53.810\nYou can upgrade it, it's easy.\n\n232\n00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.096\nAll you do is buy a new laptop.\n\n233\n00:10:55.096 --> 00:10:55.621\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:57.200\n>> And you're in business.\n\n235\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.100\nBut even on servers, if you've got\na Lenovo server and you crack open\n\n236\n00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.270\nthe lid and you see that CPU, you can pop\nit out and hold it in your hand, right.\n\n237\n00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.280\nGoing out and buying new CPUs to pop\ninto that system is not an easy thing.\n\n238\n00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.330\nIt's incredibly expensive, usually.\n\n239\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.880\nAnd if you've got more than one CPU,\nthey need to be with the same stepping.\n\n240\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.760\nThey need to have nearly identical,\nnot just model numbers,\n\n241\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.980\nbut stepping numbers, which means they're\nmanufactured at basically the same time.\n\n242\n00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.460\nCuz otherwise they can\nhave different die sizes,\n\n243\n00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.320\nit's all sorts of crazy things\nthat can happen over time.\n\n244\n00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.570\nIt's really difficult to upgrade CPUs.\n\n245\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.480\nAnd I normally just tell people you can't.\n\n246\n00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.190\nYou can, there's ways to do it, but\nit's really hard and it's not worth it.\n\n247\n00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.470\nYou just buy new systems.\n\n248\n00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.690\nSo I encourage you,\nany time you order a system,\n\n249\n00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.630\neven if you're not gonna do\nvirtualization now, go ahead and\n\n250\n00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.170\norder the system with that support,\nand it usually doesn't cost any extra,\n\n251\n00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.030\nyou just have to pick the right CPU and\nthen you're in business.\n\n252\n00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.850\nBut most of them do support it these days\nand we don't have to sweat that too much.\n\n253\n00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.950\nAll right, so\n\n254\n00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.990\nthat's an example right there of some of\nthe hardware that I have to look into.\n\n255\n00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.950\nWhen I spin up a virtual machine,\nif I wanna\n\n256\n00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.880\ndo a type-1 Hypervisor underneath to run\nthis whole show, I need the support.\n\n257\n00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.890\nIf I'm doing type-2, I don't need it.\n\n258\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:11.820\nNow, even a type-2 Hypervisor like\nVirtualBox, it doesn't require VT-x,\n\n259\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.320\nbut it'll use it if you have it.\n\n260\n00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.225\nWell, let me just ignore that over there.\n\n261\n00:12:15.225 --> 00:12:18.410\n[LAUGH] And so, if I take a look,\nI've got a virtual machine here,\n\n262\n00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.700\nVirtualBox that says ITPROTV-WEB01.\n\n263\n00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.820\nAnd if I look at the details of\nthat virtual machine over here,\n\n264\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.660\nnotice what it says.\n\n265\n00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.630\nI've got four gigs of RAM, two CPUs,\nFloppy, Optical, Hard Disk, whatever,\n\n266\n00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:34.280\nacceleration, VT-x/AMD-V, Nested Paging,\nwhich is another name for\n\n267\n00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:39.426\nSecond Level Address Translation, or\nSLAT, and Hyper-V Paravirtualization.\n\n268\n00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:44.550\nIt doesn't require VT-x, but\nif you have it it'll use it.\n\n269\n00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:47.006\nIt'll use it to speed these machines up\nand get better performance out of them.\n\n270\n00:12:47.006 --> 00:12:52.094\nSo, a type-2 Hypervisor can start to\nkind of skirt the line a little bit and\n\n271\n00:12:52.094 --> 00:12:54.651\nstart to behave a bit like a type-1.\n\n272\n00:12:54.651 --> 00:12:56.932\nYou're still not gonna get the same\nperformance out of it, but\n\n273\n00:12:56.932 --> 00:12:58.580\nit's a little bit better\nthan not having it.\n\n274\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.620\nIt's better than nothing.\n\n275\n00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.630\n>> If you can get it, go for it.\n\n276\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.720\nThat's basically what we're\ntrying to tell you here.\n\n277\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.410\nThere's no reason to not get it\ncuz you never know what you'll\n\n278\n00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.350\nwant to do in the future.\n\n279\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.980\nSo it's always good to plan ahead.\n\n280\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.030\n>> Yeah, and these options a lot\nof times can be turned on and off.\n\n281\n00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.070\nSo you might find,\n\n282\n00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.860\nlike, I'm just going into the settings\nof that virtual machine here.\n\n283\n00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.260\nAnd as I dig into the settings and\n\n284\n00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.950\nI go under Acceleration, right here I've\ngot where I can turn that on and off.\n\n285\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:25.590\nSo if I want it to function as a true\nType-2 where everything's being done in\n\n286\n00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.400\nsoftware, I can just disable\nthose options and that's that.\n\n287\n00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.780\nSo sometimes you have where you can\nturn these features on and off.\n\n288\n00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.000\nAnd in Type-1 Hypervisor,\nthey're just on, and that's that.\n\n289\n00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.760\nRight?\nThat's how it's gonna be.\n\n290\n00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.240\nIf you try and install something like\nHyper-v on a system that doesn't have\n\n291\n00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.500\nhave an acceleration in the processor or\n\n292\n00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.540\nif you're trying to sell Citrix Zen\nserver, for example, it'll complain.\n\n293\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.550\nIt'll give you big warning\nmessages on the screen.\n\n294\n00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.960\nYou'll know about it.\n\n295\n00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.740\nIt's pretty obvious.\n\n296\n00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.790\nAll right.\n\n297\n00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.070\nSo that's kind of the thing we\nneed to be aware of for CPU.\n\n298\n00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.960\nThe other thing we need to be aware of\nare our cores and our sockets, right?\n\n299\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.010\nThis particular CPU that I've got, so\nwe'll just keep running with my I7.\n\n300\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.290\nAs we look down the list here,\nit tells me all about the processor, and\n\n301\n00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.780\nits lithography and blah, blah, blah.\n\n302\n00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.410\nAnd eventually we get down\nto this guy right here,\n\n303\n00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.720\nwhich is the number of cores and\nnumber of threads, all right.\n\n304\n00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.300\nThis is important to me.\n\n305\n00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.060\nIn the olden days, when we had a server,\na server had one CPU.\n\n306\n00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:24.030\nAnd if you wanted it to go even faster,\nmaybe you got a dual CPU or a quad CPU or\n\n307\n00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.600\neven eight or sixteen CPUs in that server.\n\n308\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.740\nAnd they were separate, physical CPUs.\n\n309\n00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.325\nBut in today's modern processors,\nwe have cores instead.\n\n310\n00:14:32.325 --> 00:14:35.420\nIt's one CPU, but inside of it\nyou have more than one cores, so\n\n311\n00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.700\nit can do more than one\noperation at a time.\n\n312\n00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.290\nNow why is that important to me?\n\n313\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.910\nWell, when I created virtual machines,\nif I have one virtual machine that is\n\n314\n00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:47.600\nmonopolizing my CPU, what's gonna\nhappen to my virtual machines?\n\n315\n00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.560\nThey're gonna get slow.\n\n316\n00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.230\nRight?\n\n317\n00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.590\nBut if I have more than one core,\nor even more than one physical CPU,\n\n318\n00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:56.495\nI can assign different virtual machines to\ndifferent CPUs or different cores, right?\n\n319\n00:14:56.495 --> 00:14:58.580\nThat's called affinity,\nprocessor affinity.\n\n320\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.510\nAnd by doing that, I can have a virtual\nmachine completely monopolize one CPU and\n\n321\n00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.750\nstill have other CPUs available for\nthe other one, all right.\n\n322\n00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:11.340\nBut be very careful of this guy\nright here, # of Threads 4.\n\n323\n00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.090\nIntel loves their\nhyperthreading technology.\n\n324\n00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.150\nAnd what hyperthreading does is it says,\n\n325\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.820\nlook, inside of a processor you've got\ntransistors, millions upon millions,\n\n326\n00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.190\nprobably billions these days,\nof transistors inside of that CPU.\n\n327\n00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.570\nAnd when you're doing\na mathematical operation,\n\n328\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.630\nnot all of those transistors are used,\nright?\n\n329\n00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.470\nA lot of them are, but not all of them.\n\n330\n00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.840\nAnd so the ones that aren't being used,\n\n331\n00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.030\nsometimes there's enough that you could\nactually be running a second calculation\n\n332\n00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.210\nat the same time that just happen to use\ncompletely different set of transistors.\n\n333\n00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.271\nIf there's any overlap, it couldn't do it,\nit could only do one thing, but\n\n334\n00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:46.547\nif there's no overlap,\nit could run two things at once.\n\n335\n00:15:46.547 --> 00:15:51.610\nSo sometimes those two cores could\nactually be running four things.\n\n336\n00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.846\nBut it is an absolute sometimes, right?\n\n337\n00:15:54.846 --> 00:16:00.150\nIt's not even 50% of the time, cuz it\ncompletely depends on your instructions.\n\n338\n00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.620\nIf I'm running ten Windows Virtual\nMachines, they're all running Windows.\n\n339\n00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.030\nThey're all doing similar activities.\n\n340\n00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.350\nThere's a lot of overlap that's happening,\nand\n\n341\n00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.210\nI'm not gonna get the benefit\nof those threads.\n\n342\n00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.850\nSo when it comes to virtualization.\n\n343\n00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.640\nIt's nice to have hyperthreading,\nbut don't count on it.\n\n344\n00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.520\nAll right?\n\n345\n00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.320\nDon't think, this means I can have four\nVMs instead of processor sending across\n\n346\n00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.150\nfour and have them all pegged out\nat 100% CPU and it will be great.\n\n347\n00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.000\nIt's not gonna happen.\n\n348\n00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.530\nRight?\n\n349\n00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:27.410\nSo, we need to always plan on\nthe actual physical course we have or\n\n350\n00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.560\nphysical CPU socket.\n\n351\n00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.730\nSo, plenty of servers these days that\nstill have two reasons for physical CPUs.\n\n352\n00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:37.780\nAnd then inside of that, two, four, six,\neven eight cores eating those CPUs.\n\n353\n00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.410\nSo you can end up with quite a few\nprocessors that are easily dedicated to\n\n354\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:42.110\nvirtual machines.\n\n355\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:47.805\n>> Don, are you saying that Intel might be\nmisleading us in some way, shape, or form?\n\n356\n00:16:47.805 --> 00:16:50.420\n[LAUGH]\n>> For a desktop, for a laptop, or\n\n357\n00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.400\nwhatever, probably not.\n\n358\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.820\nYou actually do get advantages\nwith hyperthreading.\n\n359\n00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.215\nBut in a server environment the advantage\nis not as great as you see on desktops.\n\n360\n00:16:58.215 --> 00:16:59.930\nCuz there's just a lot\nof repetitious tasks,\n\n361\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.850\na lot of similar things\noccurring at the same time.\n\n362\n00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.840\nAnd you don't get that\nhyperthreading advantage there.\n\n363\n00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.420\nAll right, so definitely things to be\naware of there on the processor side.\n\n364\n00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:13.000\nNow, on the memory side,\nwe've got issues to think about there too.\n\n365\n00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.300\nObviously, if we're gonna run\nVirtual Machines, we need memory.\n\n366\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.260\nAnd if you look at my system,\nso this is VMware Fusion.\n\n367\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.170\nI'm gonna see how many different\nvirtualization products I can\n\n368\n00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.030\nuse in one show.\n\n369\n00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.270\nSo this is VMware Fusion.\n\n370\n00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:28.360\nAnd I've got three servers that are up and\nrunning, so SERVER01, SERVER02, SERVER03.\n\n371\n00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.310\nThey're all Windows Server 2012 R2, right?\n\n372\n00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:36.540\nSo Windows Server 2012 R2, they all have.\n\n373\n00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.310\nI was about to say they\nall have 2GB of RAM, but\n\n374\n00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.640\nI think I might have assigned\n3GB of RAM to each one.\n\n375\n00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.370\nLet's see how much memory I\nactually assigned to these things.\n\n376\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.620\nSo the first one has 3 GB of RAM.\n\n377\n00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.850\nThe second one has, I believe the same.\n\n378\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.060\nAnd the third one will be the same too.\n\n379\n00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.150\nYup.\nSo they all have 3 GB of RAM.\n\n380\n00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.860\nOkay.\n\n381\n00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.755\nSo at 3 GB of RAM.\n\n382\n00:17:54.755 --> 00:17:58.162\nThat's 9 GB total that I've\ndesigned of this Virtual Machines.\n\n383\n00:17:58.162 --> 00:17:59.860\nNope, that one's only got 2 GB.\n\n384\n00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.470\nSo that's 8 GB.\n\n385\n00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:03.150\nI've assigned 8 GB of RAM\nto these Virtual Machines.\n\n386\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.846\nNow if the VMs are using 8 GB,\nwhen a computer boots up and\n\n387\n00:18:06.846 --> 00:18:10.935\nit sees that it's got 8 GB of RAM or\n2 GB or 3 GB, or whatever.\n\n388\n00:18:10.935 --> 00:18:14.160\nHow much of that memory is it gonna seize?\n\n389\n00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:14.680\nAll of it, right?\n\n390\n00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.060\nIt says hey, that's all my memory.\n\n391\n00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.640\nI don't have to share that with anybody.\n\n392\n00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.510\nI'm the kernel,\nthis is my Operating System.\n\n393\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.340\nI'm gonna use all the memory\nthat's available to me.\n\n394\n00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.370\nSo they don't share by default.\n\n395\n00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.760\nThey're not very nice about\nit cuz they don't have to be.\n\n396\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.440\nThey expect to be one operating system\nrunning on one piece of hardware.\n\n397\n00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.998\nBut I'm on my laptop these are Virtual\nMachines, so they are sharing hardware but\n\n398\n00:18:33.998 --> 00:18:38.260\nI've assigned 3 GB to one, 3 GB to\nanother, and 2 GB to the third one.\n\n399\n00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.480\nSo I've assigned out 8 GB of RAM to these.\n\n400\n00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.460\nWell, what if my laptop\nonly has 4 GB of RAM?\n\n401\n00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.970\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\n402\n00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.880\nWell, all that memory doesn't\nmatch up with my physical memory.\n\n403\n00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.220\nSo anything that I go over.\n\n404\n00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.640\nIs gonna start getting\npaged to the hard drive.\n\n405\n00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.410\nRight, we do hard drive swapping.\n\n406\n00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:00.230\nAnd you never want to do hard drive\nswapping if you can avoid it.\n\n407\n00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.000\nBecause when we measure the speed of\nmemory, we measure it in nanoseconds.\n\n408\n00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.310\nWhen there's a speed of hard drives,\nwe measure it in milliseconds.\n\n409\n00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.760\nIt's an order of magnitude different.\n\n410\n00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.990\nIt is significantly slower, so the instant\nthese guys start using hard drive for\n\n411\n00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.200\nRAM, their performance drops to the floor.\n\n412\n00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.210\nYou absolutely would not\nwant that in production.\n\n413\n00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.255\n>> Now Don is that still true\neven though we have, like,\n\n414\n00:19:19.255 --> 00:19:22.545\nSSDs that are super fast nowadays,\nthey don't have any moving parts.\n\n415\n00:19:22.545 --> 00:19:24.425\nDoes that still hold true with those SSDs?\n\n416\n00:19:24.425 --> 00:19:26.515\n>> So SSDs are super fast.\n\n417\n00:19:26.515 --> 00:19:28.870\nIt's still not as fast as RAM, right?\n\n418\n00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:32.587\nCuz remember, RAM is Constantly being\nrefreshed and it gets wiped out when you\n\n419\n00:19:32.587 --> 00:19:35.577\npower off the system because of the effort\nthat it's going through to be fast.\n\n420\n00:19:35.577 --> 00:19:37.077\nSSDs don't do that, right?\n\n421\n00:19:37.077 --> 00:19:41.537\nSo, writing to an SSD is a permanent write\nthat will preserve even losing power.\n\n422\n00:19:41.537 --> 00:19:43.017\nAnd it is slower.\n\n423\n00:19:43.017 --> 00:19:45.137\nThe seek times are as fast.\n\n424\n00:19:45.137 --> 00:19:47.907\nFinding something on an SSD\nis just as fast as on RAM cuz\n\n425\n00:19:47.907 --> 00:19:50.040\nyou're doing an electric table look up,\nright?\n\n426\n00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.700\nVersus a moving an arm, a physical arm,\nto a location on a hard drive platter and\n\n427\n00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.260\ndoing a magnetic read,\nthat's different right?\n\n428\n00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.560\nBut the SSDs are still slower for\n\n429\n00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:04.230\nwrites, they're very fast for reads,\nyou know closer to RAM speeds.\n\n430\n00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:08.575\nBut they're also not designed to be\nwritten to as frequently as RAM is.\n\n431\n00:20:08.575 --> 00:20:11.040\nRight?\nIf you write to RAM enough or\n\n432\n00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.510\nwrite to SSD enough,\neventually it wears out.\n\n433\n00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.620\nAnd it's in the millions\nof writes it's a lot.\n\n434\n00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.130\nBut RAM is constantly being\nwritten to like that,\n\n435\n00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:22.820\nso there's a lot of reasons why we\nwouldn't want SSD to replace RAM.\n\n436\n00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.420\nAlthough there have been some studies,\nlike some guys at, I think it was at MIT,\n\n437\n00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.120\nhad a machine that ran,\nthat actually used SSDs as RAM and\n\n438\n00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.710\nthere's stuff you can do with that,\nbut not in production right?\n\n439\n00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.970\nSo we definitely don't want\nto be swapping hard drives,\n\n440\n00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.470\nwe want stuff happening in regular\ntraditional RAM if we can.\n\n441\n00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:44.510\nNow I've got 8 GB of virtual memory\nassigned on my laptop, I've got.\n\n442\n00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.570\nIf I can go on the right screen,\nI'm pretty sure I have 16 GB of ram.\n\n443\n00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.315\nIt's something I should probably\nknow about my own laptop.\n\n444\n00:20:49.315 --> 00:20:52.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, yeah I've got 16 GB of ram.\n\n445\n00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.480\nSo, because I have 16 GB of physical RAMs,\n\n446\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.990\nI've assigned out 8 GB\nto my virtual machines.\n\n447\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.470\nAnd I still have another 8 GB\nleft over from my desktop OS so\n\n448\n00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:06.070\nI've got room to grow and I'll be\nokay as I add more Virtual Machines.\n\n449\n00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.665\nI can even spin up some more systems.\n\n450\n00:21:07.665 --> 00:21:09.170\nRight?\nMaybe I wanna spin up this\n\n451\n00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.690\nWindows 7 machine.\n\n452\n00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.510\nWell I've gotta be careful with it\nbecause eventually I'll run out.\n\n453\n00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.240\nRight, eventually I'll run out of memory.\n\n454\n00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.530\nAnd so notice here in the memory for\n\n455\n00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.120\nthis system, they've given me like\na recommended amount of memory for the VM.\n\n456\n00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.990\nBut I can go as high as 16 GB, which would\nbe all the memory that's in my laptop, and\n\n457\n00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:30.490\nit won't let me go beyond the amount of\nmemory that I've assigned for my laptop.\n\n458\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.020\nNow be aware that little warnings like\nthis aren't necessarily accurate.\n\n459\n00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.720\nSee how this one says,\nif I give this machine 4 GB of RAM.\n\n460\n00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.040\nThat'll leave 12.2 GB of RAM for\nmy laptop.\n\n461\n00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.210\nAnd that's right.\n\n462\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.550\nAssuming I'm not running\nany other Virtual Machines.\n\n463\n00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.430\nI'm running machines already\nthat are eating 8 GB of RAM and\n\n464\n00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:48.800\nthis is not calculating that.\n\n465\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.290\nEven though VMware Fusion, you can see\nthem right here in the background.\n\n466\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.750\nThese are powered on and running.\n\n467\n00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.145\nIt's still not showing it.\n\n468\n00:21:54.145 --> 00:21:55.550\nRight?\nSo definitely tally\n\n469\n00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.350\nup your memory that's important.\n\n470\n00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.750\nOn a server when you start\nvirtualizing physical servers.\n\n471\n00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:05.160\nIf you've got five physical servers with\n4 GB of RAM each that's 20 GB of RAM.\n\n472\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.650\nSo if I wanna have one virtual\nserver host running five VMs.\n\n473\n00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:14.110\nI'm gonna need 20 GB of RAM in that\nserver and memory can get expensive but\n\n474\n00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.080\nyou need to have it.\n\n475\n00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.360\nAnother thing to be aware of its own\nmemory, sometimes you'll see options,\n\n476\n00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.230\nlet's see if this one does it,\nnope this one doesn't do it.\n\n477\n00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.710\nSo you'll see option sometimes\n\n478\n00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.200\nwhere you can do what's called\nShared Memory, all right?\n\n479\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.390\nLet me jump over to the hypervixen.\n\n480\n00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.460\nPretty sure hyper v does it.\n\n481\n00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.190\nAnd open if I'm logged in that will do it.\n\n482\n00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.490\nSo sometimes you'll see we can\ndo what's called Shared Memory.\n\n483\n00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.930\nI might assign 8 GB of RAM\nto a Virtual Machine, okay?\n\n484\n00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.430\nAnd if I assign 8 GB of RAM to a virtual\nmachine when it boots up by default the VM\n\n485\n00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.500\nis gonna try and grab all 8 GB of RAM.\n\n486\n00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.310\nThat's what they do.\n\n487\n00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.090\nThey grab all that memory.\n\n488\n00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:53.000\nBut if your virtualization\nplatform supports Shared Memory,\n\n489\n00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.530\nwhat it can do is it can say\nhey i'm gonna grab 8 GB of RAM.\n\n490\n00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.100\nBut I'm really only using a gig of it.\n\n491\n00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.950\nSo the other 7 GB.\n\n492\n00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:03.280\nThat can kinda just float out there and\nbe arbitrary, and\n\n493\n00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.690\nmaybe I share it with other people.\n\n494\n00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.990\nAnd other Virtual Machines can use it too.\n\n495\n00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.000\nOn a positive side,\nyou can do what's called Oversubscription.\n\n496\n00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.670\nI can add more memory to my\nVMs than I actually have.\n\n497\n00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:17.425\nOn a negative side, if I ever go to use\nthat memory and it's not there for me.\n\n498\n00:23:17.425 --> 00:23:20.830\nRight, if it's already in use somewhere\nelse, then I'm gonna swap down to the hard\n\n499\n00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.250\ndrive and\nI'm gonna get that big performance hit.\n\n500\n00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.370\nSo you may or\nmay not have that functionality in yours.\n\n501\n00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.700\nSo for example,\nif I take this machine, and\n\n502\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.335\nI can't remember offhand\nif Hyper-V let me do it.\n\n503\n00:23:32.335 --> 00:23:35.260\nHyper-V actually has a neat\nfeatures called NUMA Spanning,\n\n504\n00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.770\nwhich is kind of memory related also.\n\n505\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.940\nJust looking down the list here, I'm not\nseeing anything else jump out at me.\n\n506\n00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.072\nNUMA spanning allows you to have\nthe memory that spans between servers.\n\n507\n00:23:44.072 --> 00:23:48.144\nSo I could have two physical servers\nthat had 32 GB of RAM each and\n\n508\n00:23:48.144 --> 00:23:51.783\nI could create one VM that had\n50 GB of RAM assigned to it.\n\n509\n00:23:51.783 --> 00:23:53.594\nAnd some of the RAM is\ncoming from one server and\n\n510\n00:23:53.594 --> 00:23:55.413\nsome of the RAM is coming\nfrom another server.\n\n511\n00:23:55.413 --> 00:23:58.325\nNow you've got to have a network\nthat's designed to handle that,\n\n512\n00:23:58.325 --> 00:24:00.160\ncuz that's a high-performance thing.\n\n513\n00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.900\nBut you actually can do that.\n\n514\n00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.305\nAnd see how it says non-uniform\nmemory architecture?\n\n515\n00:24:05.305 --> 00:24:07.420\nNon-uniform, the memory\nis not all in one system.\n\n516\n00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.900\nIt's not necessarily even\nthe same type of memory.\n\n517\n00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.442\nAnd it allows us to span across it.\n\n518\n00:24:12.442 --> 00:24:17.100\nI am not a fan of this technology,\nbut it is something that is out there.\n\n519\n00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.930\nI'm not a fan of shared memory either,\nI don't use it.\n\n520\n00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.240\nSo, just because you're not\na fan of a technology, though,\n\n521\n00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.420\ndoesn't mean you can choose to ignore it.\n\n522\n00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:28.730\nYou may still have to use that,\neven though you don't like it.\n\n523\n00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:33.742\nBut at a minimum, you've gotta know it for\nthe exam because you wanna pass, right?\n\n524\n00:24:33.742 --> 00:24:35.181\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It would be helpful.\n\n525\n00:24:35.181 --> 00:24:35.760\n>> So, there is that.\n\n526\n00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.570\nSo I'm just gonna whip up a Hyper-V\nmachine here real quick, and\n\n527\n00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.800\nI'm just gonna use all the defaults,\nactually, I'll Gen 2 on this one.\n\n528\n00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.160\nBut I'm just gonna use the defaults,\nhere it is.\n\n529\n00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.249\nPerfect.\n\n530\n00:24:45.249 --> 00:24:47.826\nSo on this machine, I'm creating\na virtual machine in Hyper-V, and\n\n531\n00:24:47.826 --> 00:24:49.590\nit's asking me how much\nmemory I wanna give it.\n\n532\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:53.770\nAnd the default is 512 MEGS of\nmemory which is practically nothing.\n\n533\n00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.240\nSo let's say I make that\nfour gigs of memory.\n\n534\n00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.470\nOkay, and then, apparently I don't\nhave that much memory in this machine.\n\n535\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:00.730\nSo we'll do one gig of memory.\n\n536\n00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:01.540\nThere.\n\n537\n00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:05.190\nSo then the next think it asks me is\ndo I want to Use Dynamic Memory for\n\n538\n00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.840\nthe virtual machine.\n\n539\n00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.100\nWell, dynamic memory,\nthat's Microsoft's name for shared memory.\n\n540\n00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.670\nIf I do this, I've assigned\na gig of memory to this system.\n\n541\n00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:17.580\nBut I'm not necessarily always\ngoing to have that gig.\n\n542\n00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.470\nThat some of it might be in use by other\nmachines, and I can try and get it.\n\n543\n00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.580\nIf it's available, I'll have it.\n\n544\n00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.890\nBut if it's not available,\nI'll swap to the hard drive.\n\n545\n00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.060\nAnd so we can see it right there.\n\n546\n00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.450\nAnd if you run some of their\nadvanced management software,\n\n547\n00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.040\nit even lets you set\nsome more crazy things.\n\n548\n00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.260\nLike if I had\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager,\n\n549\n00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.850\nyou can set a minimum amount of memory for\nit to have at any given time and\n\n550\n00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.300\nyou can set maximum thresholds, and\nyou can prioritize your virtual machines,\n\n551\n00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.360\nwho gets high priority access to memory,\nwho's lower, and so on.\n\n552\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.070\nSo you can really start to get\nspecific with this stuff and\n\n553\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.700\nreally do some neat things.\n\n554\n00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.860\nAnd I don't think it shows\nme here in regular Hyper-V,\n\n555\n00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.550\nI'm pretty sure you have to be,\nI'm a big, fat liar.\n\n556\n00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.400\nIt's right here.\nSo looking at the virtual machine after\n\n557\n00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.960\nthe setup wizard, there's that\ndynamic memory I turned on, and\n\n558\n00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.790\nsee how I've got that minimum RAM,\nit's 512 MEGS, Maximum RAM is set,\n\n559\n00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.929\nI mean it's, what is that,\nlike a terrabyte or something?\n\n560\n00:26:07.929 --> 00:26:08.811\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n561\n00:26:08.811 --> 00:26:11.440\nit's some insane number\nthat we don't need.\n\n562\n00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.112\nBut I assigned it a gig of RAM.\n\n563\n00:26:13.112 --> 00:26:14.490\nYou can see it right up\nhere in my startup RAM.\n\n564\n00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.810\nSo when it boots up,\nit's gonna have a gig of RAM.\n\n565\n00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:22.530\nBut it could reduce down to 500 MEGS or\nit could even go higher if needed,\n\n566\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.930\nassuming the memory is there,\nassuming it's available.\n\n567\n00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:26.230\nSo we can specify that.\n\n568\n00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:27.550\nThat's shared memory.\n\n569\n00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:31.990\nShared memory lets you assign more memory\nto a virtual machine than you have or\n\n570\n00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.970\nto all of your virtual\nmachines than what you have.\n\n571\n00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.070\nSo if add up your VMs, and\n\n572\n00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.400\nthey add up to a number that's\nbigger than what your machine has.\n\n573\n00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.630\nOn a positive side, it's more efficient.\n\n574\n00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.830\nYou can make better use\nof the memory you have.\n\n575\n00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.280\nOn a negative side,\nit can be a performance hit, right?\n\n576\n00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.350\nAny time you go to hit memory\nthat's not available then you\n\n577\n00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.170\nget swapped to the hard drive.\n\n578\n00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.770\nSo in production, I don't use this.\n\n579\n00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.680\nIn tests or development, I do.\n\n580\n00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.350\nIt's great, if I want to bring up\n20 virtual machines on my laptop,\n\n581\n00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:57.730\nI'm gonna run out of memory.\n\n582\n00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.340\nBut if I can do shared memory like this,\ndynamic memory, I can do it.\n\n583\n00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.290\nI can have high amounts of memory\nallocated even though I don't actually\n\n584\n00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:05.920\nhave the physical number to back it up.\n\n585\n00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.080\nSo definitely not something\nI'd use in production,\n\n586\n00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.220\nalthough it does get better every year,\nso who knows?\n\n587\n00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.630\nMaybe one day this will be the norm, but\nthat's what they mean by shared memory.\n\n588\n00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:17.080\n>> And the good thing is that\nmemory prices are dropping left and\n\n589\n00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:22.090\nright every day, so it might just be more\ncost efficient just to grab more memory\n\n590\n00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:24.910\nto stick in your server if\nyou're seeing that, hey,\n\n591\n00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.780\nthese virtual machines keep\ngrabbing memory and losing it.\n\n592\n00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.990\nJust grab some more memory, stick it\nin the box, and take it from there.\n\n593\n00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:33.530\n>> Yeah.\nAnd on a server,\n\n594\n00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.030\nhonestly, you can never\nhave too much memory.\n\n595\n00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.550\n>> No.\n>> That's one of those things where just,\n\n596\n00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:39.620\nwhatever your budget can afford,\nyou get that extra RAM in there.\n\n597\n00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.900\nCuz you can upgrade down the road,\nbut it's kind of a pain.\n\n598\n00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.350\nAll right, so that's memory.\n\n599\n00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:46.380\nWe've got a few other things.\n\n600\n00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.630\nWe talked about CPU and memory.\n\n601\n00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.230\nThose two are really important.\n\n602\n00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:52.160\nWe've gotta make sure we've got\nthe right hardware in place for those.\n\n603\n00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.470\nBut we also need to pay attention\nto networking and disk, right?\n\n604\n00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.600\nOn the network side, things can get a\nlittle complex so I wanna talk about that.\n\n605\n00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.931\nBut I know we're running a little\nshort on time on this episode.\n\n606\n00:28:01.931 --> 00:28:03.714\nAnd on the disk side,\nit's even more complex, so\n\n607\n00:28:03.714 --> 00:28:04.950\nwe definitely wanna tackle that.\n\n608\n00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.786\nBut, Daniel, we might just\nwanna kinda wrap this one and\n\n609\n00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:09.390\ndo a part two if you don't mind.\n\n610\n00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.250\n>> I do not mind at all.\n\n611\n00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:14.080\nThis is all great information, it's\ndefinitely stuff our viewers, I'm sure,\n\n612\n00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.020\nare soaking in and just going,\nyes, this is the good stuff.\n\n613\n00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.540\nSo we look forward to a part two on this.\n\n614\n00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.670\nAnd, Don, thanks for\nstopping by on this episode.\n\n615\n00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:24.700\nAnything else you wanna\nsay before we part?\n\n616\n00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.900\n>> And just that we've kind of only\nbroken the tip of the iceberg.\n\n617\n00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.930\nWe talked about CPU and memory, we still\nhave disk, we still have network, and\n\n618\n00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:31.850\nwe still technically haven't\ncreated a virtual machine.\n\n619\n00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.110\nSo we're gonna wrap all this\ntogether to creating our VMs and\n\n620\n00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.995\ngetting them in place.\n\n621\n00:28:34.995 --> 00:28:38.100\nNow, these are all things that we need to\nknow before we make that decision to jump\n\n622\n00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.240\nin and start virtualizing.\n\n623\n00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.140\n>> All right, well, Don,\nI look forward to seeing you in part two,\n\n624\n00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.440\nwe look forward to seeing you\nthere in part two as well.\n\n625\n00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.670\nThanks for watching today.\n\n626\n00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.294\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n627\n00:28:47.294 --> 00:28:48.237\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n628\n00:28:48.237 --> 00:28:50.454\n>> We'll see you next

They start by explaining virtual networks and virtual switches. They show you the many ways which you can connect a VM to your actual network through bridging, NAT, and even VLAN assignment. Then they jump into virtual disks where they explain concepts like fixed vs. dynamic size, IDE/SATA/SCSI virtualization, and virtual Storage Area Networks(SAN).",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.230\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.730\nin this episode we're continuing on with\nour Cloud Series, Cloud Plus for CompTia.\n\n5\n00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.400\nThis is actually a part two, we had so\nmuch good information the last one\n\n6\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.050\nthat we couldn't get in the rest of it so\nwe had to come back for more.\n\n7\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.300\nAnd joining us again is our good friend,\nMr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.300\nDon, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.060\nHow you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.860\n>> I'm doing great, thanks for\nhaving me back and in the last show I\n\n11\n00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.720\nrambled on a little too long about CPU and\nmemory so we still didn't get to disk and\n\n12\n00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.800\nnetwork and that's what we're going to\ntake a look at right here in this episode\n\n13\n00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.740\nBecause your virtual machine is going\nto need network access, well usually,\n\n14\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.550\nmaybe you've got a machine that's\nisolated, but we're also going to need\n\n15\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.400\na place to store our data,\ndisk access for that virtual machine.\n\n16\n00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.260\nSo we're gonna take a look at some of\nthe different concerns that we have there,\n\n17\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.590\nhow we can kind of provision and\n\n18\n00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.870\ncreate that storage, how we can setup\nthose networks, and the different ways and\n\n19\n00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.630\nterminologies that you're gonna see\nin your virtualization platform.\n\n20\n00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.470\n>> That's right.\nNow Don,\n\n21\n00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.470\nyou make a really good point there.\n\n22\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.460\nYou say that you might have\na machine that is isolated, and\n\n23\n00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.950\nvirtualization is great for that.\n\n24\n00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.760\nIf you need to build a test bed and\nyou don't want anybody to touch it or\n\n25\n00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.520\nmess with it, or you don't want it to\ncontact your production environment.\n\n26\n00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.150\nOr maybe you've got something you wanna\ntest for viruses, things of that nature.\n\n27\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.630\nIt's always great to jump\ninto virtualization for that.\n\n28\n00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.950\nBut like you said, if we're doing\nthings more like in a cloud base.\n\n29\n00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.920\nWe're building a private cloud or\nwe're going with a public cloud.\n\n30\n00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.040\nWe do want to actually make\ncontact with these things.\n\n31\n00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.940\nWe want all of our, if it's a file server,\nthen I'm gonna contact that file server.\n\n32\n00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.440\nSo networking is an important\nfeature of that.\n\n33\n00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.420\nAnd it is the run of the mill networking,\nbut\n\n34\n00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.910\nthere is the virtualization aspect to\nit that we've got to kind of learn.\n\n35\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.230\nSo I guess that's where\nwe should start today.\n\n36\n00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.690\n>> All right, so\nlet's take it off with networking and\n\n37\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.260\nI wanna bring up the concept of\nwhat's called the virtual switch.\n\n38\n00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.340\nIt's the kind of key concept, really no\nmatter what virtualization software you\n\n39\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.390\nuse If you think about a computer,\nif I have two computers and\n\n40\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.550\nI want them to talk to each other,\nI need to connect them together.\n\n41\n00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.360\nAnd I could take a crossover cable and\nplug them directly into each other,\n\n42\n00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.900\nbut we normally plug them into a switch.\n\n43\n00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.320\nAnd if I have a 24 port switch,\nI could plug in 24 computers and\n\n44\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.360\nthey'll all see each other right?\n\n45\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.940\nYou just plug them in and\nthey see each other, right?\n\n46\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.060\nIt's that easy.\n\n47\n00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.540\nStick a router in there and\nnow they can get up to the internet too.\n\n48\n00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.260\nThat's your typical network.\n\n49\n00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.340\nSo I need switches to\nconnect physical computers.\n\n50\n00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.890\nWell I can use switches to\nconnect virtual machines also.\n\n51\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.940\nSo in your virtualization software you'll\nbe able to create virtual switches.\n\n52\n00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.590\nYour software may not call\nthem virtual switches.\n\n53\n00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.880\nBut that's what they're building.\n\n54\n00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.430\nSome of them, like HyperV and VMWare ESX,\n\n55\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.040\nthey specifically call them virtual\nswitches, or V switches, right?\n\n56\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.730\nThey actually use that terminology.\n\n57\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.700\nOther ones like VMWare Fusion, they\njust call them virtual networks, right?\n\n58\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.290\nBut they are ultimately\nan imaginary switch.\n\n59\n00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.050\nAnd any virtual machine you plug into\nthat imaginary switch will be able to\n\n60\n00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.970\nsee each other.\n\n61\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.360\nAnd if you choose to add\na router to that virtual switch,\n\n62\n00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.280\nthen they'll be able to get\nout to the Internet, right.\n\n63\n00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.830\nThat functionality is all there,\nit's up to you to configure it.\n\n64\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.750\nNow when we create a virtual switch like\nthat there's really three modes that\n\n65\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.000\nit can run into.\n\n66\n00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.790\nSo the first mode is\nwhat's called isolated.\n\n67\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.150\nThe one, you know,\nthat Daniel was mentioning.\n\n68\n00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.110\nI might have a virtual machine\nthat I want to be isolated.\n\n69\n00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.540\nI don't want it to have access\nto the rest of my network.\n\n70\n00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.460\nSo I make it just kind of all by itself.\n\n71\n00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.890\nWell, why would I want to do that?\n\n72\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.730\nWell I'll have give you a great example,\n\n73\n00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.200\nI've worked with backups, just a ton\nof my lifetime working in IT, right.\n\n74\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.580\nAnytime you have a mission critical\nsystem you need to back it up.\n\n75\n00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.670\nAnd the only thing more\nimportant that taking backups\n\n76\n00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.930\nIt's testing the backups\nto make sure they work.\n\n77\n00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.340\nDoing a restore.\n\n78\n00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.310\nSo if I wanna restore a backup, maybe\nI've got a server, it's my a web server.\n\n79\n00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.850\nSo I've got this web server that's\nmission critical, it's gotta be up, so\n\n80\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.070\nI take a backup of it.\n\n81\n00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.670\nAnd now I wanna do a test.\n\n82\n00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.760\nPressed restore.\n\n83\n00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.330\nWell, if I restore that to another\npiece of hardware on my network.\n\n84\n00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.360\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\n85\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.120\nI'm gonna duplicate names on the network,\nduplicate IPs.\n\n86\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.150\nI might have some of my end users get\nsent over to this restored test server.\n\n87\n00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.130\nSo, I have a lot of problems.\n\n88\n00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.100\nBut I can whip out virtual machines,\nand I can isolate them.\n\n89\n00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.310\nAnd I can restore that server and\n\n90\n00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.430\nfully test it and everything without\naffecting the rest of my network.\n\n91\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.720\nSo isolated systems can\nbe really beneficial.\n\n92\n00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.780\nYou can also create ones that are what\nare called host only networks.\n\n93\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.450\nWhere the virtual machine\nis able to see itself.\n\n94\n00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.940\nAnd the virtualization host, now in\na server environment you won't really\n\n95\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.520\ndo that, you never want a virtual machine\nto see the ESX box underneath it,\n\n96\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.310\nor hyperv underneath it or whatever.\n\n97\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.720\nBut if it's your desktop, like for me,\n\n98\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.590\nI've got these virtual machines\nright here on my laptop and\n\n99\n00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.090\nI might want them to see my laptop so\nthat I can transfer a file to them right?\n\n100\n00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.320\nAnd so that would be a host only network.\n\n101\n00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.900\nAnd then the last option would\nbe just a shared network,\n\n102\n00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.830\nwhich is where we connect them up\nto a regular full blown network.\n\n103\n00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.560\nWe don't hide anything, they're just\nout there participating as members.\n\n104\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.620\nAnd there's a few different\nways we can set that up.\n\n105\n00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.810\nSo let me walk you through how this works.\n\n106\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.230\nAnd maybe we'll start over in Hyper-V.\n\n107\n00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.120\nSo let me jump over to\nMicrosoft's Hyper-V and\n\n108\n00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.980\nI've got a server here with Hyper-V up and\nrunning.\n\n109\n00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.100\nAnd if I pull up the Settings here for\nthat server and look at my options.\n\n110\n00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.570\nYou'll see where I've got my Hyper-V\nSettings and my Virtual Switch Manager.\n\n111\n00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.950\nSee how they specifically\ncall it a Virtual Switch.\n\n112\n00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.120\nI can come in here and\ncreate virtual switches for\n\n113\n00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.380\nmy virtual machines to be plugged into.\n\n114\n00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.680\nAnd right now,\nI don't have any virtual switches so\n\n115\n00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.160\nit's offering to create a new one.\n\n116\n00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.420\nAnd it's giving me three options.\n\n117\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.470\nExternal, Internal, Private.\n\n118\n00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.280\nAnd those are the three I was\ntalking about a minute ago.\n\n119\n00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.950\nPrivate, that's an isolated switch.\n\n120\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.800\nYou'll only be able to see other systems\nplugged into the system and that's it.\n\n121\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.970\nInternal, that is just like private\nexcept you can see the host also.\n\n122\n00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.170\nThis is the host only network,\nI was talking about.\n\n123\n00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.280\nAnd External, that's a regular network,\n\n124\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.200\none where you can see\neverybody that's out there.\n\n125\n00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.180\nWe don't hide anything.\n\n126\n00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.280\nIt's an external connection, right?\n\n127\n00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.200\nSo I'm picking which kind\nof switch I want to create.\n\n128\n00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.310\nIf I want to create a test\nrestore environment, right?\n\n129\n00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.910\nI want to test restoring\na domain control or\n\n130\n00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.900\nan email server,\nI could create a private network.\n\n131\n00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.400\nAnd choose to create that virtual\nswitch and I'll give it a name.\n\n132\n00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.820\nSo maybe I'll call this like\nmy Restore Network, and so\n\n133\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.920\nnow I've got this virtual switch.\n\n134\n00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.350\nAnd when I look at my settings,\n\n135\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.420\nyou'll see I've got a few other options\nin here like my connection type.\n\n136\n00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.620\nAnd the connection type is defaulting\nto private cuz that's what I chose.\n\n137\n00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.750\nBut I could also choose internal network.\n\n138\n00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.640\nAnd again that would be basically\nlike private but with a host also.\n\n139\n00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.340\nBut notice external network,\nit's got a lot of options.\n\n140\n00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.520\nIn your virtualization software you'll see\nwhere you have more than one option here\n\n141\n00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.020\nfor an external network.\n\n142\n00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.840\nFor example you can do\nwhat's called a bridge.\n\n143\n00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.180\nA bridge is where you take\nthis virtual network, and\n\n144\n00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.040\nyou attach it to a physical\nnetwork adapter like this one.\n\n145\n00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.700\nAll right.\n\n146\n00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.920\nThat means these virtual machines,\nthey're gonna think they're on your\n\n147\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.150\nregular local area network,\nthey're on the LAN.\n\n148\n00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.030\nThey'll request a DHCP address.\n\n149\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.340\nThey'll function just like\nanybody else on the network.\n\n150\n00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.430\nThey have no idea they're\nplugged into a virtual switch.\n\n151\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.290\nBut other systems will have options where\nyou can do network address translation.\n\n152\n00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.670\nWhere it hides them behind an IP and so\n\n153\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.090\nnow they don't know that they're\nplugged into a regular network.\n\n154\n00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.020\nIn HyperV though,\nthey bonded to a physical, and\n\n155\n00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.070\nthis is normally what we would want,\nyou want your virtual machine\n\n156\n00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.460\ntalking to everybody else, just like it\nwas a regular participant on the network.\n\n157\n00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.610\nRight, but notice some of the other\noptions that I've got here like allowing\n\n158\n00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:34.310\nmanagement on the interface, and allowing\nsingle-root I/OV visualization or SR-IOV.\n\n159\n00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.020\nYou might have physical network\nadapters that support SR-IOV and\n\n160\n00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.400\nthat can increase the speed and efficiency\nwhich it will be able to handle it.\n\n161\n00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.080\nRemember that a network adapter is really\ndesigned to handle traffic for one node.\n\n162\n00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.795\nCuz it's plugged into one node.\n\n163\n00:07:46.795 --> 00:07:49.094\nBut with virtualization I could have 10,\n15,\n\n164\n00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:51.125\n20 nodes running right\nhere on this host and\n\n165\n00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:54.608\nyour network adapter's not necessarily\ngeared up to be able to handle that.\n\n166\n00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:58.234\nThey have hardware acceleration in\nthem that's designed to track things\n\n167\n00:07:58.234 --> 00:08:00.455\nlike sequence numbers and\nTCP offloading and\n\n168\n00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:04.498\nall that stuff That's really designed for\none host, not 20 virtual machines.\n\n169\n00:08:04.498 --> 00:08:06.660\nAn SR-IOV helps with that.\n\n170\n00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.820\nThe input/output virtualization\nallows them to communicate through\n\n171\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.960\nit a little better.\n\n172\n00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.850\nAnother option that you\nmay see is a VLAN ID.\n\n173\n00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.170\nNormally when we plug a physical\nserver into a port on a switch.\n\n174\n00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.107\nIt's one network and that's it.\n\n175\n00:08:21.107 --> 00:08:25.220\nBut in a switching network you can have\nVirtual Local Area Networks- VLANs.\n\n176\n00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.019\nWhere the ports on the switch are divided\nup into separate networks, now I'm not\n\n177\n00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:31.000\ntalking about virtual switches anymore\nI'm talking about real physical switches.\n\n178\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.070\nYou can divide those ports up and\nif we do that,\n\n179\n00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.460\nwhen you divide them you give them VLAN\nnumbers, and if we're supporting that,\n\n180\n00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.730\nwe could run a single network cable\nto our virtualization server, and\n\n181\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.910\nwe can set it up as a trunk where\nit carried more then one VLAN.\n\n182\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.632\nIf you're doing that, and you need to turn\non this virtual land identification option\n\n183\n00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:54.358\nand tell it which VLAN\nnumber this is attached to.\n\n184\n00:08:54.358 --> 00:09:02.441\nSo for example,\nin my network maybe I've got my LAN.\n\n185\n00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:06.710\nWell just call this the ITProTV LAN,\nright?\n\n186\n00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:13.450\nAnd I want that to be attached to my\nIntel network card so I'm cool with that,\n\n187\n00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.200\nand I'll leave SR-IOV off, I don't think\nI have support for that on my system.\n\n188\n00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.330\nThen I'll tell it, for the VLAN number\nmaybe that just happens to be VLAN number\n\n189\n00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.450\none, okay, or\nyou may have an untagged VLAN,\n\n190\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.660\nI don't want to get into that\ntoo much here on this show.\n\n191\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.390\nIf you want to learn more about VLAN,\ndefinitely check out our Cisco show,\n\n192\n00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.060\nwe cover it in great depth over there.\n\n193\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.120\nBut if you have an untagged VLAN you\nwould just leave this off, right?\n\n194\n00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.710\nBut if I have VLAN one, I can set that,\nright, and so that's my first switch,\n\n195\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.720\nand then maybe I've got a Oops,\nI need to apply that real quick.\n\n196\n00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.220\nAnd then maybe I've got a DMZ that's\non VLAN 2, or VLAN 200 or whatever.\n\n197\n00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.590\nSo I can add a second network on that\nsame network card that I can set up for\n\n198\n00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:54.790\nVLAN 2, and.\n\n199\n00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.330\nYeah, it's gonna give an error for me.\n\n200\n00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.700\nHere, we'll just do a new switch.\n\n201\n00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.570\nI'll do another external one,\nI'll create that switch and\n\n202\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.980\nI'm going to tell it here that it\ngoing to be on that Intel adaptor,\n\n203\n00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.600\njust like the last one, but for the VLAN\nID it's actually auto-incremented to two\n\n204\n00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.800\nso we can set that and\nnow I'll have those two switches, right?\n\n205\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.140\nOne that's ITProTV LAN, the other\none that's going to be ITProTV DMZ.\n\n206\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.380\nAnd so\nnow whenever I create a virtual machine,\n\n207\n00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.360\nit's gonna ask me where I want\nto plug their adapter in.\n\n208\n00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.870\nI just tell it to plug in to the land\nswitch or the DMZ switch and\n\n209\n00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.900\nthey'll be assigned to the right network,\nand\n\n210\n00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.760\nthis is all off of one\nphysical cable to the server.\n\n211\n00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.330\nNow, I'm not the biggest fan of that,\n\n212\n00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.490\nbecause when you have one cable,\nyou've got bandwidth contention, right?\n\n213\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.370\nThey're fighting each other for that\nbandwidth access but if you're not worried\n\n214\n00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.640\nabout bandwidth, if you have plenty of\nbandwidth then it's no big deal and\n\n215\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.420\nit saves you cabling and effort, right?\n\n216\n00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.800\nSo there's a few different ways\nthat we can make advantage of that.\n\n217\n00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.550\nJust be aware that what I just\nshowed you is in Hyper-V.\n\n218\n00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.511\nWhen you go to other virtualization\nsoftware like VMware,\n\n219\n00:10:56.511 --> 00:11:02.010\nV-Sphere or Virtual Box or whatever they\nmay use different terminology, right?\n\n220\n00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.440\nSo for example here in VMware Fusion,\nif I go up here to VMware Fusion and\n\n221\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.630\npreferences, we have a whole\nnetworking section here.\n\n222\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:15.710\nAnd they're not calling them virtual\nswitches, they're just virtual networks.\n\n223\n00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.490\nI can come in here and\ncreate virtual networks.\n\n224\n00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.390\nAnd you'll see I've got several of\nthem already created like vmnet2.\n\n225\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.610\nAnd when I look at vmnet2 over\nhere it says allow virtual\n\n226\n00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.090\nmachines on this network to connect\nto external networks using net right.\n\n227\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.130\nI'm gonna network and just translates\nthem as they pass through and\n\n228\n00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.390\nI'm gonna provide DHCP address system.\n\n229\n00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:39.240\nSo anybody I plug in the vmnet2 will\nget an IP address in this range and\n\n230\n00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.545\nbe able to go out through\nVMware Fusion as the router.\n\n231\n00:11:42.545 --> 00:11:47.310\nVMfusion's gonna be hiding the hosts,\nor the guests behind it, right?\n\n232\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.850\nAnd that may not be what I want because\nI might want it to be visible on\n\n233\n00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.660\nthe physical network.\n\n234\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.790\nAnd so if I take a virtual machine like\nthis CentOS Linux box that I've got here,\n\n235\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:00.920\nand dive into its settings, and\nI'm gonna go into it's network adapter.\n\n236\n00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.040\nWhen I look at it's network adapter, I can\npick from all those virtual networks that\n\n237\n00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.426\nI've got right here, or I can do internet\nsharing, which would be the network\n\n238\n00:12:10.426 --> 00:12:13.370\naddress translation model right,\nthat would kind of be the hidden one.\n\n239\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:16.170\nOr I can do bridged networking.\n\n240\n00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.580\nAnd right now I've got\na network adaptor on\n\n241\n00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.480\nthe side of my laptop that's\na thunderbolt adapter.\n\n242\n00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.690\nAnd if I were to bridge this virtual\nmachine to my thunderbolt adapter, then,\n\n243\n00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.700\nI need to be an administrator to do that.\n\n244\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.210\nSo, let me give it credentials.\n\n245\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.250\nThere we go.\n\n246\n00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.110\nThen when this virtual machine boots up\n\n247\n00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.400\nIt's gonna think that it's on our\nstudio network, just like my laptop is.\n\n248\n00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.310\nIt's bridged to that adapter.\n\n249\n00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.310\nMy adapter is now gonna be\ntransmitting two MAC addresses.\n\n250\n00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.750\nOne for my desktop, or my laptop, and\n\n251\n00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.900\none for this virtual machine, and\nthey're both gonna be viewed as\n\n252\n00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.470\nregular hosts on the network that\nanybody else that's out there.\n\n253\n00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.570\nI'm the only one who knows it's virtual,\nright?\n\n254\n00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.340\nThat's a bridged adapter.\n\n255\n00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.470\nWhen you expose your external network\nright to the virtual machine and\n\n256\n00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.630\nit just feels like it's\nout there on that node.\n\n257\n00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.750\n>> Now Don we have a quick question\ncoming from the chat room.\n\n258\n00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.950\nThey're asking,\nwe've got a virtual switch going on,\n\n259\n00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.860\nhere we're talking about virtual switch,\ncan we also virtualize a router,\n\n260\n00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.750\nis there a way to do that or do we\nalso have to go with hardware routers?\n\n261\n00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.750\n>> So yes and no right?\n\n262\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.720\nSo technically some of these options are\nvirtualizing a router all ready, right?\n\n263\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.620\nSo for example, let's take these servers\nthat I've got, I'll take SERVER01 here.\n\n264\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.270\nSERVER01 is a virtual machine\nthat's running on VMware Fusion.\n\n265\n00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.840\nAnd if I go into my settings and\n\n266\n00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.210\nlook at its network, which is buried\nin here somewhere, there we go.\n\n267\n00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.990\nYou'll see I've got it attached to vmnet3.\n\n268\n00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.660\nRight, so\nit's on that virtual machine network 3.\n\n269\n00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:38.370\nAnd if I go back into VMware's\npreferences, and I check out vmnet three,\n\n270\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:43.590\nall right, so,\nhere is vmnet three and you've got\n\n271\n00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.220\nallow virtual machines in this network\nto connect to extra network using that.\n\n272\n00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.490\nIn other words, the enter machines\ncan't get out to the external networks\n\n273\n00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.140\nunless we translate them first.\n\n274\n00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.232\nWell, who's gonna do the translation?\n\n275\n00:13:54.232 --> 00:13:58.107\nVMware Fusion is, right,\nit's going to act as a router.\n\n276\n00:13:58.107 --> 00:14:02.249\nIt's gonna create a virtual router and\nit's already done that.\n\n277\n00:14:02.249 --> 00:14:05.430\nIf I jump over to SERVER1,\nwhich is this guy, right.\n\n278\n00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:10.023\nSo if I take SERVER1, and let me\njust get down into a command prompt.\n\n279\n00:14:10.023 --> 00:14:16.560\nAll right, and I do a quick little\nipconfig, my studio network is 192.168.\n\n280\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:22.850\nOr no, the studio network's\n10.1.230.whatever, right?\n\n281\n00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.690\nBut this one is 192.168.0.201.\n\n282\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.050\nThat is not my studio network, okay?\n\n283\n00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:32.840\nBut if I ping out the Internet I\ncan ping the Internet.\n\n284\n00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.650\nSo how did it get to the Internet?\n\n285\n00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.280\nIt went through a default gateway.\n\n286\n00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.740\nAnd my default gateway is 192.168.0.2.\n\n287\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.200\nWho is that?\n\n288\n00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.080\nWell that's a virtual router\nthat VMware Fusion created.\n\n289\n00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.840\nAnd so it is a real thing as\nfar as this guy's concerned.\n\n290\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.730\nIf I ping it, I ping it,\nit exists and if I do a arp lookup,\n\n291\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.960\nI can find a 192.168.0.2 right there and\n\n292\n00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.900\nit's got a mac address that we're\ntalking to right there that I learned\n\n293\n00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.740\nfrom the network, so it looks like a real\nentity, but it is a virtual router.\n\n294\n00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.320\nAll right, so yes, we can have a virtual\nrouter, but, I said yes and no right,\n\n295\n00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.910\nthe no side of it,\nI can't do anything with that router.\n\n296\n00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.940\nI can't configure it,\nI can't put access lists on it,\n\n297\n00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.120\nI can't do anything really powerful to it.\n\n298\n00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.840\nRight?\n\n299\n00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.430\nSo because it's super mega limited it's\nnot something I'm really gonna wanna use.\n\n300\n00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.580\nAnd so when you jump into HyperV or VMWare\nDSX they don't even give you the option,\n\n301\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.620\nthey don't even provide\nthat virtual router.\n\n302\n00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.780\nAnd instead they say well if\nyou want a virtual router\n\n303\n00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.310\njust bring up a virtual machine,\nand make it a router.\n\n304\n00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.970\nYou can bring up Linix in a virtual\nmachine and make it a router.\n\n305\n00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.410\nI do pfSense firewalls all the time.\n\n306\n00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:45.860\nI'll put pfSense in a virtual machine,\nand it's a firewall and a router.\n\n307\n00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.860\nAnd you can use it that way.\n\n308\n00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.800\nThere's tons of different solutions for\nthat.\n\n309\n00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.020\nAnd it just runs as a VM right?\n\n310\n00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.670\nAnd they do a great job for\nhandling that traffic.\n\n311\n00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.628\n>> One more question\nfrom the chat room today.\n\n312\n00:15:55.628 --> 00:15:59.369\nDouglas thought he could\nonly bond one nick or\n\n313\n00:15:59.369 --> 00:16:02.918\none network card, To one virtual switch.\n\n314\n00:16:02.918 --> 00:16:03.638\nIs that not the case?\n\n315\n00:16:03.638 --> 00:16:05.198\nCan you do multiple?\n\n316\n00:16:05.198 --> 00:16:06.630\n>> Well you can.\n\n317\n00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.880\nSo Douglas you're technically right with\n\n318\n00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.370\nthe UI that I was showing\nyou a moment ago, right?\n\n319\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:16.280\nSo when I create that virtual switch\nin Hyper-V, which I've now misplaced.\n\n320\n00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.360\nBut when I create that\nvirtual switch in Hyper-V,\n\n321\n00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.650\nit didn't give me the option to\nadd more than one adapter, did it?\n\n322\n00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.540\nSo it looks like you can't do it.\n\n323\n00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:28.850\nBut the way you do it is\njust outside of Hyper-V.\n\n324\n00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.600\nVMware ESX will let you\nattach more than one adapter.\n\n325\n00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.210\nYou can have a primary and\na backup, right.\n\n326\n00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.308\nOr you can even load balance to a degree.\n\n327\n00:16:36.308 --> 00:16:39.990\nBut in Hyper-V, when I come in and\ncreate this new external switch,\n\n328\n00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:44.100\nI create that switch and\nit only lets me pick one adapter, right?\n\n329\n00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.820\nBut what if I have two adapters or\nfour adapters?\n\n330\n00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.250\nWhy would I need that many adapters?\n\n331\n00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.090\nWell, two for redundancy.\n\n332\n00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.540\nWhat if one cable dies,\na link dies, something like that?\n\n333\n00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.350\nWe have a second one for back up.\n\n334\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.730\nBut the other thing is,\n\n335\n00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:00.230\nif I've got 20 virtual machines running on\nhere, I might be running out of bandwidth.\n\n336\n00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.570\nWouldn't it be nice if I could\nhave four network adapters?\n\n337\n00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:07.230\nAnd maybe I've got four gigabit adapters,\nor four 10 gig adapters, right,\n\n338\n00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.470\nI could have 40 gigabit of\nbandwidth on this server,\n\n339\n00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.710\nif I could bond all those together.\n\n340\n00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.275\nAnd that's the trick\nright there is the bond.\n\n341\n00:17:13.275 --> 00:17:16.960\nHyper-V can't do bonding.\n\n342\n00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.860\nBut you can, right.\n\n343\n00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.990\nDepending on who made your network\nadapters, you may, if it's intel,\n\n344\n00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.640\nyou just use the intel\nnetwork manager utility.\n\n345\n00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.970\nAnd it can bond those adapters together,\nand\n\n346\n00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.915\nthen it'll show up here\nas a bonded adapter.\n\n347\n00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:32.950\nHyper-V doesn't need to know\nthat it's more than one adapter,\n\n348\n00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.020\nthat can be handled behind the scenes.\n\n349\n00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.530\nBut you can see it right here.\n\n350\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.260\nAnd even if your vendor doesn't\ngive you software for it,\n\n351\n00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.880\nyou could always bridge adaptors,\nand make it happen too.\n\n352\n00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.440\nWindows has that kind of built in.\n\n353\n00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.260\nLinux does too.\n\n354\n00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.900\nSo you can bond adaptors that way.\n\n355\n00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.160\nBut you just have to bond it outside\nof your virtualization software.\n\n356\n00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.900\nAnd then you come to\nthe virtualization software, and\n\n357\n00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.130\nyou'll be able to pick\nthe bonded adaptor right here.\n\n358\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.380\nSo that's how you get around that.\n\n359\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.730\nIn ESX you don't have to worry about it.\n\n360\n00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.450\nIt has that support baked in.\n\n361\n00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:02.185\nBut in, actually I think it's Citrix\nXenserver has it built in too, but in\n\n362\n00:18:02.185 --> 00:18:05.710\nHyper-V you have to do it outside of this,\nso, yep, that's how you get around that.\n\n363\n00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.456\nAll right, so\nthat's the networking side of things.\n\n364\n00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:13.120\nThat's all kind of key and critical\nbecause when it comes time to create\n\n365\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.050\na virtual machine,\nwhen you create a virtual machine and\n\n366\n00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.870\nyou're running through the wizard and\nyou get to that network adaptor part and\n\n367\n00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.390\nit's asking you,\nwhat is that network adapter plugged into.\n\n368\n00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:27.290\nYou gotta pick right here, and it's\nasking you to pick the virtual switch.\n\n369\n00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.881\nAnd that virtual switch may be\nconnected to your external network,\n\n370\n00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:31.960\nit may be isolated.\n\n371\n00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.400\nIt might be host only.\n\n372\n00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.600\nIt's all based on your needs.\n\n373\n00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.540\nSo, you've gotta make sure you\nchoose appropriately there or\n\n374\n00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.260\nyou might not be able to communicate.\n\n375\n00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.510\nAll right, and notice how I can override\nthe VLAN identifier right here.\n\n376\n00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.710\nUsually you want this VLAN identifier\nto match your virtual switch's\n\n377\n00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:49.600\nVLAN identifier, or just not be set here,\ncuz it'll use the one on the switch.\n\n378\n00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.640\nBut you can override it.\n\n379\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.240\n>> Well Don, I guess that takes\nus out of network English,\n\n380\n00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.110\nwhich was a good fun trip.\n\n381\n00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.830\nBut we also gotta talk about storage,\nright?\n\n382\n00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.830\nWe've got hard drives.\n\n383\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.690\nWe've gotta actually put\nthis data somewhere.\n\n384\n00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.330\nAnd, you gotta remember,\nthis is types of operating system.\n\n385\n00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.490\nWe've got the Hyper-Visor,\nthey all have to be on storage.\n\n386\n00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:10.600\nAnd how do we deal with storage?\n\n387\n00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.750\nIs it basically like a traditional\nstyle where we just see, hey,\n\n388\n00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:14.410\nthere's a hard drive.\n\n389\n00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.910\nStick it there.\n\n390\n00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.110\n>> It is different, right?\n\n391\n00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.930\nAnd there's a few reasons\nwhy this is different.\n\n392\n00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.900\nBut when we write our data to\na hard drive in a virtual machine,\n\n393\n00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.340\nit's gotta store it somewhere.\n\n394\n00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.650\nAnd so\nit's creating virtual hard drives or VHDs.\n\n395\n00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.820\nAnd not all virtual hard\ndrives are created equally.\n\n396\n00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.240\nAnd Hyper-V calls them VHDs,\nvirtual hard drive.\n\n397\n00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.850\nVirtual box has VHDs also,\nthey also have VDIs, Virtual Disk Image.\n\n398\n00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.190\nSo the different image\ntypes that are out there.\n\n399\n00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:46.090\nVMWare using VMDK,\nwhich is a virtual machine disk image.\n\n400\n00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.080\nVMDK.\n\n401\n00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.990\nSo there's a few different formats, but\nthey all work basically the same way.\n\n402\n00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.850\nThey take anything that you would\ntraditionally write to a hard drive and\n\n403\n00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:55.040\nthey store it in a file.\n\n404\n00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.150\nAnd that file can be\nstored somewhere else.\n\n405\n00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.930\nWhen we start talking about clustering and\nthings,\n\n406\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.748\nwe'll see that that gets really important,\nwhere we put that storage.\n\n407\n00:20:01.748 --> 00:20:07.530\nBut even on a standalone machine, on a\nType 2 hypervisor running on your laptop,\n\n408\n00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.130\nyou've gotta worry about\nhow that storage is built.\n\n409\n00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:15.750\nWhen you create that virtual hard drive\nthere's two decisions you have to make.\n\n410\n00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.860\nThe first decision is how big\nyou want it to be, right,\n\n411\n00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.320\nwhat size you want that drive to be.\n\n412\n00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.310\nAnd that's something you\ncan change after the fact.\n\n413\n00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.800\nSo it's not really like\na binding decision.\n\n414\n00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.160\nBut the other decision you have to make\nis whether it's going to be a fixed or\n\n415\n00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.750\ndynamically expanding disc.\n\n416\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.430\nNow what am I talking about there?\n\n417\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:37.670\nWell, let's say that my laptop's\nrunning low on hard drive space.\n\n418\n00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.520\nAnd so I go, and\nI buy a one terabyte external drive, and\n\n419\n00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.630\nI stick it on the side of the laptop,\nformat it to use it.\n\n420\n00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.250\nHow much of that one terabyte\ndrive am I using right now?\n\n421\n00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.499\nWell 100% of it.\n\n422\n00:20:47.499 --> 00:20:51.541\nIt might be empty but I'm using 100% of\nit, I've got access to all that space\n\n423\n00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:55.890\nright now, cuz it's given to me, it's\nmine and I don't have to share it, right?\n\n424\n00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.456\nComputers don't share by default,\nit's not their nature.\n\n425\n00:20:59.456 --> 00:21:02.125\nBut if I have a virtual\nhard drive wouldn't it be\n\n426\n00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:06.082\nnice if I could reclaim some of that\nspace if I'm not using it, right?\n\n427\n00:21:06.082 --> 00:21:11.223\nIf I give a TB hard drive to that\ncomputer, and it's only put 20 gigs of\n\n428\n00:21:11.223 --> 00:21:17.500\ndata in it why set aside a TB of storage\nfor it if it's only using 20 gigs?\n\n429\n00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.490\nAnd so most virtualization systems will\nsupport what are called dynamically\n\n430\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.390\nexpanding discs, or sometimes they're\ncalled FIN provisioned, right.\n\n431\n00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.810\nWhen you provision a disk,\nyou provision the whole thing.\n\n432\n00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:34.420\nIf I give a virtual machine, 64 gigs\nof storage, right now, it's gonna take\n\n433\n00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.100\n64 gigs of storage on my underlying file\nsystem, and set it aside for that machine.\n\n434\n00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.940\nNow, why does it do that?\n\n435\n00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:46.360\nWell, it wants to grab all 64 gigs\nright now, so it can be nice and\n\n436\n00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.090\nwhat they call contiguous on the hard\ndrive, it's all in a row, right?\n\n437\n00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.860\nThink about file fragmentation.\n\n438\n00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.760\nWhen you write files to a hard drive and\ndelete files from a hard drive and so\n\n439\n00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.410\non just through regular operations\nyour data becomes fragmented.\n\n440\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.220\nAnd eventually it can affect\nperformance and you can defragment,\n\n441\n00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.940\na lot of modern file systems defragment\nthemselves so we don't worry about it so\n\n442\n00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.150\nmuch anymore but it is still something\nthat needs to be in the back of your mind,\n\n443\n00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.390\nyour file system can become fragmented.\n\n444\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:15.440\nWell, if I got a VHD, a virtual hard\ndrive or VMDK or a VDI or whatever.\n\n445\n00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.010\nThat's a file and\nit's being stored on a file system so\n\n446\n00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.760\nit can become fragment, right?\n\n447\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:26.770\nYes, it's a file, it happens but then\ninside of that VMDK or inside of that VHD.\n\n448\n00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.749\nI'm writing files for\nthis virtual operating system.\n\n449\n00:22:29.749 --> 00:22:32.333\nAnd they can become fragmented\nin there too right?\n\n450\n00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:35.120\nYou can actually end up\nwith double fragmentation.\n\n451\n00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.180\nFragmentation in the file and\nfragmentation on the hard drive and\n\n452\n00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.610\nnow your performance is terrible.\n\n453\n00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.630\nEspecially if you're on\nspinning disk right.\n\n454\n00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:45.790\nRemember with spinning disk you've\ngot a platter that spins in a circle.\n\n455\n00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:50.240\nAnd you've got a mechanical arm that moves\nback and forth to find and read data.\n\n456\n00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.760\nActually, it doesn't move as\nmuch as I'm moving my finger.\n\n457\n00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.170\nBut it moves to read that data.\n\n458\n00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.120\nAnd if it's having to jump all\nover the drive to find your data,\n\n459\n00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.290\nthat slows it down, right?\n\n460\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.640\nVersus if it was all nice and in a row,\n\n461\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.330\nthe arm could kind of freeze in one spot\nand just read the data as a whizzed on by.\n\n462\n00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.150\nThis is where SSD becomes so important.\n\n463\n00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.970\nSSD, Solid State Digital.\n\n464\n00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.749\nWhen we read from a SSD disk,\nthere's no arm.\n\n465\n00:23:11.749 --> 00:23:15.392\nWe just say show me address 1,422,873,\n\n466\n00:23:15.392 --> 00:23:19.999\nblah, blah, blah,\ngive me this particular address' data.\n\n467\n00:23:19.999 --> 00:23:21.410\nAnd it returns that data.\n\n468\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:21.970\nAnd that's it, right?\n\n469\n00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.240\nThere's no seek time.\n\n470\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.880\nBut on a spinning disk, there is a seek\ntime if performance is an issue.\n\n471\n00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.010\nAnd fragmentation is important.\n\n472\n00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.160\nOn SSD fragmentation is\nactually not that bad,\n\n473\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.410\nwhat do we care if we have to go 20\ndifferent places cuz we just do a look up?\n\n474\n00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.560\nIt actually takes the same amount of\neffort so fragmentation on an SSD,\n\n475\n00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.060\na lot of people just\ndon't even care about it.\n\n476\n00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.050\nIt can actually benefit you in\nsome ways because with an SSD,\n\n477\n00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.630\nif you're continually writing to the same\nplace on the disc over and over and\n\n478\n00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.430\nover again it's gonna wear out faster.\n\n479\n00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:51.680\nSo you can extend the life of your SSD\nby allowing it to be fragmented, and\n\n480\n00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.000\nyou dont take a performance hit.\n\n481\n00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.999\nSo, that may not be an issue.\n\n482\n00:23:54.999 --> 00:24:00.829\nBut, if you're deploying a VHD,\nwhether it's SSD or not.\n\n483\n00:24:00.829 --> 00:24:05.840\nIf it allocates the whole storage\nright at the very beginning.\n\n484\n00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.280\nThat's allocated, it's there.\n\n485\n00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.760\nIt's ready to be used whenever you are.\n\n486\n00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.220\nBut if you do a thin provision disk.\n\n487\n00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.760\nOr if you do a dynamically expanding disk.\n\n488\n00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.710\nI might creating a 20 GB disk, but\n\n489\n00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:20.640\nit's only gonna set aside a very\nsmall piece of it, right?\n\n490\n00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.000\nA very small piece.\n\n491\n00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.040\nAnd as I start copying data into it.\n\n492\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.360\nThat disk is gonna grow.\n\n493\n00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.680\nIt's gonna start getting bigger and\nbigger and bigger as I add data,\n\n494\n00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.920\nand it's gonna grow.\n\n495\n00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.163\nAnd the problem there is when\nthe original disk was set out.\n\n496\n00:24:34.163 --> 00:24:36.920\nThere may have been tons\nof space on my hard drive.\n\n497\n00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.030\nBut the time the disks\nare supposed to grow,\n\n498\n00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.430\nthere might not be that space anymore.\n\n499\n00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:44.190\nSo now it's just trying to find random\nspace all over the disk somewhere.\n\n500\n00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.750\nThere's gotta be space here somewhere,\nlet me get to that, right?\n\n501\n00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.430\nAnd that space may cause fragmentation.\n\n502\n00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:52.590\nWe may have to jump all over and\nnow or disk becomes fragmented, right?\n\n503\n00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.465\nOn a spinning disk,\nthat's gonna be bad performance.\n\n504\n00:24:55.465 --> 00:25:00.081\nOn SSD it's not so bad but\neven on SSD the act of expanding the disk.\n\n505\n00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:02.490\nTakes effort, it's done in software.\n\n506\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.140\nIt takes effort and\nit's gonna slow your machine down.\n\n507\n00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.930\nAnytime the disk expands\nyour performance gets hurt.\n\n508\n00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.910\nSo, we may choose not to expand.\n\n509\n00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.020\nAnd I'll tell you how I make the decision.\n\n510\n00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.770\nIf this is something I'm rolling out of\nproduction, I always do a fixed disk.\n\n511\n00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.640\nA fully provisioned disk.\n\n512\n00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.150\nBut if this is something I'm\ndoing in test or development.\n\n513\n00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.220\nMy thin provision.\n\n514\n00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:27.495\nI just deployed what I need because I'm\nnot worried about performance on that.\n\n515\n00:25:27.495 --> 00:25:28.850\nRight?\nAnd you can even mix and\n\n516\n00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.410\nmatch a lot of these things\nwhen you choose to deploy them.\n\n517\n00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.750\nSo for example like here in Hyper-V,\n\n518\n00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.790\nlet me take this Virtual Machine and\nI'm gonna go into its settings.\n\n519\n00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.530\nAnd I actually don't remember\nwhat I chose on the disk.\n\n520\n00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:41.369\nI think Hype-V defaults to thin\nprovision if I remember right.\n\n521\n00:25:41.369 --> 00:25:44.650\nBut I don't recall and\nyou can actually convert them.\n\n522\n00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:45.860\nIt's not a fast process but\n\n523\n00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.410\nyou can convert them from\none to the other later on.\n\n524\n00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:53.285\nIt's actually really easy to go from\nthin provision to fully provision.\n\n525\n00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:57.505\nReally hard to go the other way, but\nlet's just say I add some new disks here.\n\n526\n00:25:57.505 --> 00:26:01.515\nSo, I'm gonna add a new disk to this\nsystem and I'll go in here to, or\n\n527\n00:26:01.515 --> 00:26:04.015\nactually I need to add another controller,\ndon't I?\n\n528\n00:26:04.015 --> 00:26:05.205\nYep, so I'm gonna add a hard drive.\n\n529\n00:26:05.205 --> 00:26:09.775\nAnd it's asking me about the hard drive\nand the file that I wanna use, and so\n\n530\n00:26:09.775 --> 00:26:11.975\nI'm just gonna tell it\nthis is an all new file.\n\n531\n00:26:11.975 --> 00:26:14.790\nAnd so, it's gonna launch\nthe little Hard Drive Wizard.\n\n532\n00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:19.575\nAnd it's gonna ask me do I want it to be\nfixed sized, or dynamically expanding?\n\n533\n00:26:19.575 --> 00:26:20.190\nRight?\n\n534\n00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.460\nFully provisioned, or thin provisioned?\n\n535\n00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.690\nIn VMware they actually just\ncall it thin provisioned.\n\n536\n00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.520\nBut here they're asking me.\n\n537\n00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.430\nAnd so I'm gonna do this one fixed size,\nall right.\n\n538\n00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:35.810\nAnd so I'm gonna say that\nthis is a FIXED_DISK.VHD.\n\n539\n00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:40.400\nAnd it's gonna get parked, apparently\nit doesn't need my file extension.\n\n540\n00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.370\nSo it's gonna get parked\nright here in this folder, so\n\n541\n00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.840\nI'm just gonna copy that so\nI can browse to it in a minute.\n\n542\n00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.270\nAll right, so this is gonna be my fixed\ndisk and I'm gonna set it to be nice and\n\n543\n00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.520\nsmall cuz I don't wanna wait all day for\nthis thing to provision.\n\n544\n00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.030\nCuz when I say it's a fixed disk, it's\ngonna provision out all 5 GB right now.\n\n545\n00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:59.040\nActually did I choose fixed?\n\n546\n00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.030\nYes, I did.\nGood.\n\n547\n00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:03.680\nSo I'm just gonna do 5 GB to make\nit not too crazy on me, okay.\n\n548\n00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.730\nSo I'll set 5 GB and\nthen we'll let that one finish up.\n\n549\n00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.940\nNow when I do that,\nI'm gonna see a little status bar pop up.\n\n550\n00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.900\nI'm waiting for it to provision.\n\n551\n00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.210\nI only did 5 GB, so that's no big deal.\n\n552\n00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:15.810\nBut if I'd done a terabyte?\n\n553\n00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.950\nThis can take an hour, cuz it's\nactually laying out a full terabyte\n\n554\n00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.140\non the hard drive and\nreserving it, and flagging it, and\n\n555\n00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.260\ngetting it setup where nobody else\ncan use it when you do a Fixed_Disk.\n\n556\n00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.591\nSo you might need to do this at night and\nthen go home.\n\n557\n00:27:27.591 --> 00:27:28.429\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n558\n00:27:28.429 --> 00:27:29.454\n>> And be ready in the morning.\n\n559\n00:27:29.454 --> 00:27:32.180\nIf you watch our Hyper-V shows,\nI think I actually talked about how I had\n\n560\n00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.330\nto schedule these operations to happen\novernight, cuz it can take a while.\n\n561\n00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.540\nAll right, so now I've got that disk,\nand I can apply that.\n\n562\n00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.690\nAnd then, maybe I'll add another disk and\nthat was a 5 GB disk.\n\n563\n00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.050\nI'm gonna add another one here.\n\n564\n00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:51.020\nAnd on this one,\nI'm gonna choose Dynamically expanding.\n\n565\n00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.670\nI'm not gonna choose fix disk this time,\nand so,\n\n566\n00:27:53.670 --> 00:28:00.450\nI'll call this one my Dynamic_Disk, and\nwe'll just let it go in that same folder.\n\n567\n00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.610\nAll right, and I will make it 5 GB,\njust like the other one.\n\n568\n00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.290\n>> But with this, you could probably\nmake it 25 GB if you wanted to, and\n\n569\n00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.975\nit would still go really, really fast.\n\n570\n00:28:08.975 --> 00:28:10.700\n>> Yup\n>> Because we're doing that dynamically\n\n571\n00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.450\nexpanding disk.\n\n572\n00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:14.070\n>> Absolutely, and\nyou'll see I didn't get any status bar.\n\n573\n00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.370\nIt's just done, right?\n\n574\n00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:16.420\nIt's done, it finished it.\n\n575\n00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.340\nIt created it.\n\n576\n00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.670\nI'll apply that and\nnow I've got those extra hard drives.\n\n577\n00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:20.900\nBut, if I browse on your hard drive and\n\n578\n00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.200\ntake a look at what actually happened,\nright.\n\n579\n00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.630\nSo, if I browse, here's the Dynamic_Disk\nand here's the Fixed_Disk.\n\n580\n00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:32.360\nSo I can see those and\nover here, I've got their size.\n\n581\n00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.220\nAnd if I look at their size,\n\n582\n00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:39.310\nthe Dynamic_Disk is four megs in size,\nthat was.\n\n583\n00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.620\nWell, there's a minimum\nsize to these files.\n\n584\n00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.590\nThey have to have allocation tables and\nstructure and\n\n585\n00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:49.420\nother things to find in them so four megs\nis apparently my minimum on this one.\n\n586\n00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.920\nBut then the Fixed_Disk, it's 5 GB.\n\n587\n00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.970\nIt's 5 GB right now.\n\n588\n00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:53.940\nEven though it's completely empty.\n\n589\n00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.950\nI haven't put a single in it.\n\n590\n00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.300\nIt's 5 GB.\n\n591\n00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.930\nThis one is frozen in time.\n\n592\n00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.620\nThat's the size that it's going to be.\n\n593\n00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.940\nBut the one up here, the Dynamic_Disk.\n\n594\n00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.610\nAs I copy data into it, it will grow.\n\n595\n00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:08.250\nAnd if you're on your laptop, if you're on\na desktop, if you're doing development or\n\n596\n00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.850\ntest work, that's great, cuz you can\nget a lot more bang for your buck for\n\n597\n00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:12.910\nyour hard drive.\n\n598\n00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.990\nI don't have a lot of\nstorage in my laptop.\n\n599\n00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.020\nI think I've got 256 GB\nof SSD in my laptop.\n\n600\n00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.134\nSo if I wanna create a bunch\nof Virtual Machines,\n\n601\n00:29:21.134 --> 00:29:23.600\nyou could eat up to 256 GB really fast.\n\n602\n00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.320\nBut if I thin provision the disk,\nI can get a little more out of that space.\n\n603\n00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.735\nBut if you thick provision,\nif you do the fully provisioned disk or\n\n604\n00:29:32.735 --> 00:29:36.840\nFixed_Disk, when you do it that way,\nyou get better performance.\n\n605\n00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.510\nAnd that's what you really need for\nproduction.\n\n606\n00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.620\nSo that's a big difference between\nthe two different ways that we handle\n\n607\n00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.960\nthat storage.\n\n608\n00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.880\nA few other things we need to be aware of,\nI know I'm running low on time but\n\n609\n00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.700\nI gotta get these points in\nto be complete for you guys.\n\n610\n00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.630\nI talked about those disk, the thin and\nthick provisioning, or dynamic and\n\n611\n00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:55.670\nfixed size.\n\n612\n00:29:55.670 --> 00:30:01.410\nI also wanna mention IDE,\nSATA, and SCSI settings.\n\n613\n00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:06.330\nWhen you attach a disk to a system,\nit will normally ask you, and\n\n614\n00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.180\nlooking here inside of Hyper-V.\n\n615\n00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.570\nSee how it's got SCSI controller?\n\n616\n00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:11.540\nRight?\nSo SCSI,\n\n617\n00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:16.730\nSCSI controller, it doesn't have to\nbe SCSI, when you go to that hardware\n\n618\n00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:20.820\nyou may have other options in here,\nlike I've got a fibre channel adapter.\n\n619\n00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.820\nIf I'm connected to a SANs and\nwe'll talk about SANs in another episode.\n\n620\n00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.440\nBut you might have IDE or\neven SATA, as options.\n\n621\n00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.160\nRight Hyper-V doesn't, but\nif I go over to, for example.\n\n622\n00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.410\nWe'll go into this Windows\n7 machine in VMware Fusion.\n\n623\n00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:40.450\nSo, here I am in VMware Fusion, and notice\nthat I've got a hard drive, SCSI, and\n\n624\n00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.290\na CD drive that's SATA.\n\n625\n00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.500\nIf I go up here to add a device.\n\n626\n00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.670\nWhen I go to add it, I can pick a disk.\n\n627\n00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:51.390\nAnd when I pick to add the disk\nin my advance options,\n\n628\n00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:56.170\nI can actually select what bus type\nI want, IDE, SCSI, SATA all right.\n\n629\n00:30:56.170 --> 00:31:00.560\nNow, a lot of people look at and\nsay I want SCSI, that's fast,\n\n630\n00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.370\nthat's what they use in servers,\nI want SCSI.\n\n631\n00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:06.530\nBut the reality is it doesn't truly\nmatter when you're dealing with\n\n632\n00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:07.430\na type two hypervsior.\n\n633\n00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.900\nFor the type two hypervisor\nit's virtualized anyway.\n\n634\n00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.710\nSo you need to pick the one\nthat's the most compatible\n\n635\n00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.060\nwith your guest operating system.\n\n636\n00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.890\nIn a type two hypervisor like this one.\n\n637\n00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.130\nIt's emulated hardware,\nwhat does it matter.\n\n638\n00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:24.010\nBut when you've got a type one hypervisor\nespecially one where CPU has VTD support.\n\n639\n00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.710\nYou're allowing the Virtual Machines to\ndirectly interact with the storage bus.\n\n640\n00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:29.290\nAnd so they need to be the same.\n\n641\n00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:33.190\nAnd that's why when I was in my server\nI only had SCSI, I didn't have SATA or\n\n642\n00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.070\nIDE as a choice.\n\n643\n00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:35.150\nI just had SCSI.\n\n644\n00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:38.620\nSo your choice may be really limited\nhere based on your physical hardware.\n\n645\n00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.450\nAnd if that's the case, it doesn't matter\ncuz the one it's limiting you to is\n\n646\n00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:42.490\nthe one you'd want anyway.\n\n647\n00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.980\nThat's the one that's optimal.\n\n648\n00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.110\nBut in a type 2 hypervisor\nyou can do what you want so\n\n649\n00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:48.110\nyou may have a lot more options.\n\n650\n00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.390\nNow here, see how I can pick SCSI and\nthat's about it?\n\n651\n00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:51.818\nNo other crazy options for me.\n\n652\n00:31:51.818 --> 00:31:55.298\nWell, pre-allocate disk space, that would\nbe a Fixed_Disk versus Dynamic, right?\n\n653\n00:31:55.298 --> 00:31:57.078\nThis was defaulting to dynamic.\n\n654\n00:31:57.078 --> 00:32:00.438\nSometimes you'll also see\nthe option to specify a SCSI ID.\n\n655\n00:32:00.438 --> 00:32:01.038\nAll right.\n\n656\n00:32:01.038 --> 00:32:03.528\nOn a SCSI bus,\nyou have ID's zero through 15.\n\n657\n00:32:03.528 --> 00:32:04.768\nThere's 16 ID's.\n\n658\n00:32:04.768 --> 00:32:06.000\nAnd some of those are reserved.\n\n659\n00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.350\nLike zero's reserved.\n\n660\n00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.250\nIt's either seven or\neight that's reserved.\n\n661\n00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:09.960\nI always forget that one.\n\n662\n00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.560\nThe one that's tied to the controller.\n\n663\n00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.280\nIt gets reserved.\n\n664\n00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.170\nSo, there's a few that are reserved,\nbut the other ones are available.\n\n665\n00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.630\nAnd you can specify whatever ID you want.\n\n666\n00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.300\nBut it does follow some of the old rules.\n\n667\n00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:24.940\nSo for example, if you do IDE, the first\ndrive on that chain is the master and\n\n668\n00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.130\nthe secondary one is the slave.\n\n669\n00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.110\nSo if you're booting off of the system,\nit boots off the master, or primary and\n\n670\n00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.770\nsecondary, or whatever terminology\nyour virtualization software uses.\n\n671\n00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.390\nYou may also have SCSI,\n\n672\n00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:39.560\nwhere the lower the SCSI ID number,\nthe higher it is in the boot order and\n\n673\n00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:44.080\nthe higher read-write priority it gets, if\nyou're doing contentious reads and writes.\n\n674\n00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.780\nSo, those numbers do matter,\nas far as performance is concerned, and\n\n675\n00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.260\nyou'll need to choose appropriately.\n\n676\n00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:54.770\nSATA is the only one that really doesn't\nmatter, because it's one channel per disk,\n\n677\n00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.080\nand so you really don't have to\nworry about IDs and priorities and\n\n678\n00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.610\nthat stuff But IDE you could\nhave two disks per channel and\n\n679\n00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:05.840\nSCSI you could have 16 ID numbers but I\nthink it actually maxes out at like 14 or\n\n680\n00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.510\n15 because of the reserve numbers,\nbut you can have those on or\n\n681\n00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.900\nyou can create additional SCSI\ncontrollers if you need it.\n\n682\n00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:18.030\nSo that is another thing, and\nthen virtual SANs, right?\n\n683\n00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.630\nWe're going to talk about real SANs in\nanother episode, Storage Area Networks.\n\n684\n00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.510\nBut you can have virtual SANs also.\n\n685\n00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.890\nAnd virtual SANs are useful for\na few different reasons.\n\n686\n00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.410\nOne you can use them to hide\nphysical SANs on the back end.\n\n687\n00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:33.700\nAnd that allows you to move from hardware\nto hardware to hardware and your virtual\n\n688\n00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.710\nmachines don't necessarily know about it\nbecause the SAN is completely hidden.\n\n689\n00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:37.690\nBut the other thing is,\n\n690\n00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:42.750\nyou might want to have two virtual\nmachines clustered together, right?\n\n691\n00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.830\nTwo virtual machines\nthat have shared storage.\n\n692\n00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:48.740\nBy default, all these virtual disks that\nI'm making are direct attached storage.\n\n693\n00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.260\nThey're tied to one virtual machine.\n\n694\n00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.110\nIf I need shared storage between\nmore than one virtual machine.\n\n695\n00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.200\nI might wanna set up\na virtual SAN to do it.\n\n696\n00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.770\nAnd not all virtualization\nsoftware will do it.\n\n697\n00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:04.300\nYou might've noticed I did have\nthe option here in Hyper-V.\n\n698\n00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.170\nSo when I was in Hyper-V,\nwhen I pulled up my server settings,\n\n699\n00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.990\nyou've got a Virtual SAN Manager\nright here.\n\n700\n00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:14.880\nAnd we can jump into this and\nwe can create a fake.\n\n701\n00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.980\nFibre Channel SAN, right.\n\n702\n00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.850\nAnd if we do that,\nif I create a Fibre Channel SAN,\n\n703\n00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:24.100\nit's going to have to attach to a Fibre\nChannel adapter that'll then run to a SAN.\n\n704\n00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.080\nAnd I don't have one in my laptop so\nit's got no Fibre Channel ports detected.\n\n705\n00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.800\nBut I've created a Fibre Channel SAN and\nI can then attach my VMs to it.\n\n706\n00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.360\nAnd they'll see the storage area network\nand they'll see the drives there.\n\n707\n00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.390\nAnd now they can have shared storage and\nthey can cluster up.\n\n708\n00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:38.950\nThere's other ways to do it.\n\n709\n00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:41.750\nBut this way does it over true\nfiber channel which is gonna give\n\n710\n00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.230\nyou great performance.\n\n711\n00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:47.370\nIn this case,\nif your storage is on the SAN,\n\n712\n00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.490\nyou might not have virtual hard\ndrives attached to your VM's at all.\n\n713\n00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:53.080\nRight?\nI might not have any VHD's or VMDK's or\n\n714\n00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.640\nwhatever, just none at all.\n\n715\n00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.910\nIt's all stored out there in the sand.\n\n716\n00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:59.820\nAnd we use that virtual sand\nto be able to connect to it.\n\n717\n00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.510\nSo, really need technology\nthere pretty useful thing and\n\n718\n00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.690\nit allows your virtual machines\nto have that optimized storage.\n\n719\n00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.360\n>> Hold on.\n\n720\n00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.710\nWe've talked a lot about\ndifferent storage types and\n\n721\n00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:11.330\nhow virtualization deals with storage.\n\n722\n00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:15.770\nAnd I know we actually have a little\nbit more information to go through.\n\n723\n00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.450\nWe have definitely have\nrun his filthy servers.\n\n724\n00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:23.370\nIt's great information but it looks like\nwe're gonna go to a part three on this.\n\n725\n00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.770\n>> Yeah,\nwe need to get into a little more,\n\n726\n00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.670\nI still haven't technically created\na full virtual machine, right.\n\n727\n00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:29.220\nSo we need to run through\ncreating a virtual machine and\n\n728\n00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.800\nall the different options that we set\nthat all pertain to processor, memory,\n\n729\n00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.670\ndisk, network.\n\n730\n00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:34.400\nRight, all of the settings.\n\n731\n00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.880\nSo we'll get a chance to see those.\n\n732\n00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.570\nAnd I want to talk a little\nbit about snap shots, and\n\n733\n00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.860\nother things we can do to\nclone virtual machines.\n\n734\n00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.100\nAnd so we'll get a chance to\nsee all of those in part 3.\n\n735\n00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.720\n>> Alright,\nwell it's going to be a good time,\n\n736\n00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.030\nit's gonna be the culmination of these\nother two parts that we've done.\n\n737\n00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.930\nHopefully we'll see you there.\n\n738\n00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:51.380\nThanks for joining us Don and\nthank you guys for watching.\n\n739\n00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.310\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n740\n00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:54.700\nI've been your host, Daniel Awry.\n\n741\n00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:55.380\n>> And I'm Don Fisset.\n\n742\n00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.087\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n743\n00:35:57.087 --> 00:36:04.150\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:18.579\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n5\n00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.540\nin today's episode we'll continue on with\nour Cloud+ series we've been working on.\n\n6\n00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.360\nSpecifically today is a part three,\nhopefully you're gonna love it.\n\n7\n00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.400\nWe're working on virtualization.\n\n8\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.240\nAnd joining us yet again,\nlending his giant massive brain and\n\n9\n00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.690\nintellect to this very feat is\nour good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.200\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.570\n>> You know Daniel, you always set\nme up with these high expectations.\n\n12\n00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.925\nThen I feel like I gotta try and\nlive up to them.\n\n13\n00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:39.970\n[LAUGH]\n>> Good luck with that.\n\n14\n00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.710\n>> So we're gonna talk about\nstuff this episode [LAUGH].\n\n15\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.870\nAnyhow, we're on part\nthree of this series.\n\n16\n00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.805\nAnd we still haven't technically created\na full virtual machine which is somewhat\n\n17\n00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:52.015\namazing in and of itself.\n\n18\n00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:53.605\nBut its gonna happen this time.\n\n19\n00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:55.865\nI promise you right here,\nwe are gonna create a virtual machine.\n\n20\n00:00:55.865 --> 00:00:58.585\nWe're gonna see all the options that we've\ntalked about in the last two episodes.\n\n21\n00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:01.587\nIt will all come to fruition\nright here as we get it set up,\n\n22\n00:01:01.587 --> 00:01:03.795\nbring the virtual machine up,\nand kind of tune it and tweak it.\n\n23\n00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:07.345\nThen you'll see there's a little bit more\nto just flipping the switch on a machine,\n\n24\n00:01:07.345 --> 00:01:10.180\nthat we'll have to do a couple of\nthings to get it running optimally\n\n25\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.480\nin doing all the stuff we need.\n\n26\n00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.836\nSo, that's what we're gonna be tackling,\nwell, right here.\n\n27\n00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:18.460\n>> Right here, [LAUGH] well,\nthat being said, I guess a great place for\n\n28\n00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.320\nus to start is let's create\na virtual machine now.\n\n29\n00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.640\nYour virtual machine software, as you've\nseen throughout this little mini-series\n\n30\n00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.540\nwe've been working on here so\nfar, can differ wildly.\n\n31\n00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.130\nBut the basic concepts and\n\n32\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.277\nthe things that we need to know about\nthat, they all kind of apply, right?\n\n33\n00:01:32.277 --> 00:01:33.720\nSo we've gotta know the CPU.\n\n34\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.630\nWe gotta know about our RAM.\n\n35\n00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.990\nWe gotta know about our storage.\n\n36\n00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.020\nAnd, Don, today is the day you're\nactually going to do that.\n\n37\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.520\nSo, we are looking forward to that.\n\n38\n00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.430\nI leave it to you, sir.\n\n39\n00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.470\nCreate me a virtual machine if you will.\n\n40\n00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.876\n>> So, regardless of which platform\nyou use, if you're using VMware ESX or\n\n41\n00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:51.640\nHyper-V, you're using a desktop\nprogram like VirtualBox,\n\n42\n00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.500\nyou're using Amazon Web Services or\nMicrosoft Azure, regardless of what\n\n43\n00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.300\nplatform it is, when you create a virtual\nmachine you're gonna have a little wizard.\n\n44\n00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.940\nAnd the wizard's gonna ask you about your\nfour main things, processor, memory,\n\n45\n00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.590\nCPU and disc.\n\n46\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.530\nYou're going to have to answer those\nquestions to create the virtual machine.\n\n47\n00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.490\nAnd the wizards are always pretty simple.\n\n48\n00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.190\nThey really just don't ask you a ton.\n\n49\n00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.940\nBut once the virtual machine is created,\n\n50\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.120\nyou've got a whole window of settings\navailable that you can go in and tweak and\n\n51\n00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.260\nchange and optimize to get that\nsystem working the way that you want.\n\n52\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.790\nSo I'm going to walk\nyou through an example.\n\n53\n00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.968\nAnd I'm going to use\nVMware Fusion here for the show.\n\n54\n00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:27.670\nBut, in real-life land it's really\nthe same concept on whatever\n\n55\n00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.040\nplatform you're on.\n\n56\n00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.670\nSo let's say that I decide I need\na new Windows machine up and\n\n57\n00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.600\nrunning on my system.\n\n58\n00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.730\nAnd it could be Windows Server or\nWindows desktop.\n\n59\n00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.290\nIt could be Linux, for all that matters.\n\n60\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.170\nReally, the operating system, let me talk\nabout the operating system for a second.\n\n61\n00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.700\nThe operating system,\nit doesn't technically matter.\n\n62\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.210\nYou can run pretty much any operating\nsystem in a virtual machine.\n\n63\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.840\nBut they're not all supported.\n\n64\n00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.460\nSo in other words,\n\n65\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.530\nif I choose to run OpenBSD on top of\nVMware Fusion, I can do that, it'll run.\n\n66\n00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.230\nBut it's not officially\nsupported by VMware.\n\n67\n00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.270\nAnd so when I do that,\n\n68\n00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.090\nif I have any problems, I won't be\nable to call them and get any help.\n\n69\n00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.030\nThey won't help me, right?\n\n70\n00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.040\nSo when I go to start to create,\nwhoops, when\n\n71\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.540\nI go to start creating new virtual\nmachines inside of VMware Fusion,\n\n72\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.990\nit's gonna expect me to run an operating\nsystem that they support, right?\n\n73\n00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.920\nAnd if I pick one they don't support,\nI'll get little warnings on it.\n\n74\n00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.180\nBut when you create a new virtual machine,\n\n75\n00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.660\none of the first questions you'll\nusually get is this one right here.\n\n76\n00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.050\nHow are you gonna install an operating\nsystem, on the virtual machine, right?\n\n77\n00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.620\nNow, when I did it in Hyper-V in\nthe last show, it didn't ask me that.\n\n78\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.080\nAnd that's because it let me\ncreate the virtual machine with\n\n79\n00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.210\nthe hardware I wanted.\n\n80\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.510\nAnd now, it's up to me to put a virtual\nCD in that machine, power it on and\n\n81\n00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.890\ninstall the operating system.\n\n82\n00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.850\nI'll talk about some ways we can\nkinda shortcut that system later on.\n\n83\n00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.892\nBut for now, if I've got a new\nmachine that I'm creating,\n\n84\n00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:49.690\nand I just wanna create it from scratch,\nI need to provide an install image.\n\n85\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.640\nAnd the install image is typically\ngoing to come from a virtual CD image.\n\n86\n00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.710\nA lot of vendors that are out there\nrelease their operating systems as\n\n87\n00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.110\nISO files, right?\n\n88\n00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.200\nPretty much every Linux distro does it.\n\n89\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.910\nMicrosoft sends out ISOs\nof their operating systems.\n\n90\n00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.570\nAnd you basically just mount the ISO and\n\n91\n00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.170\nthe virtual machine thinks\nthat it has a CD in it.\n\n92\n00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.200\nYou boot it up and\nyou install like normal.\n\n93\n00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.170\nSo I'm gonna choose to\ninstall from a disk or image.\n\n94\n00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.700\nAnd it's gonna ask me what image I want.\n\n95\n00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.028\nAnd I've got a couple laying around.\n\n96\n00:04:16.028 --> 00:04:19.070\nIf I wanted to do CentOS Linux,\nI've got one of those.\n\n97\n00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.930\nBut I'm gonna install this one,\n\n98\n00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.160\nwhich is a Windows 10 image\nthat I got from Microsoft.\n\n99\n00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.050\nIf you're a Microsoft partner or if you\nhave a Microsoft Enterprise agreement,\n\n100\n00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.520\nthey give these to you freely.\n\n101\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.000\nEven if you're just a regular home user,\nyou can go to Microsoft's website.\n\n102\n00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.150\nAnd they have evaluation versions\nof Windows 10, Windows server 2012.\n\n103\n00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.360\nYou can download right from their site\nas ISO files that are usable for this.\n\n104\n00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.940\nAnd if you actually own the software,\nyou can put in your product key and\n\n105\n00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.030\nmake use of it.\n\n106\n00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.080\nIf you don't have a product key, Microsoft\ngives you special product keys to use for\n\n107\n00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.700\nthe evaluation.\n\n108\n00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.130\nSo I'm gonna do Windows 10,\nand obviously continue.\n\n109\n00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.890\nNow, Windows 10 is a supported\nsystem with VMware Fusion.\n\n110\n00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.850\nAnd I know that because it offers to\nlet me do the Windows Easy Install.\n\n111\n00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.790\nAnd that means that it recognized it.\n\n112\n00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.750\nIt knew the operating system.\n\n113\n00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.890\nIt knew what I wanted to do.\n\n114\n00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.940\nAnd it's not just gonna install Windows.\n\n115\n00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.370\nIt's gonna install it and\nset it up For VMware fusion.\n\n116\n00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.510\nAnd it would do the same\nthing if I did Linux.\n\n117\n00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.970\nLet me go back here, and instead of\nthat one, I'm gonna pick CentOS, right?\n\n118\n00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.380\nAnd when I go forward, it knows CentOS.\n\n119\n00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.630\nAnd it knows to get that set up and\nwhat it's gonna need.\n\n120\n00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.290\nAnd it's gonna give me these settings.\n\n121\n00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.130\nActually, I didn't see the quick setup,\nlet me cancel that.\n\n122\n00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.780\nThey must have already been in\nWindows mode by that point.\n\n123\n00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.430\nSo let me try that again.\n\n124\n00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.190\nAnd we'll go through and\nwe'll pick CentOS and continue forward.\n\n125\n00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.160\nAnd no,\nit's just gonna take me right there.\n\n126\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.810\nBut it'll know to ask me\nwhat those settings are,\n\n127\n00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.720\nget it set up, and\ninstall the virtual machine tools.\n\n128\n00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.980\nNow those virtual machine\ntools are important.\n\n129\n00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.410\nWe're going to see them\na little bit later.\n\n130\n00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.000\nBut they only work on\na supported operating system.\n\n131\n00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.060\nThey won't work on unsupported\noperating systems.\n\n132\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.380\nAnd they allow the guest OS to take\nfull advantage of the hardware.\n\n133\n00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.510\nSo that's kind of a key\npiece of doing these setups.\n\n134\n00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.680\nNow, I'm gonna choose Windows 10.\n\n135\n00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.250\nAnd I'm gonna continue forward.\n\n136\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.220\nAnd I'm not gonna do the Easy Install\nbecause the Easy Install\n\n137\n00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.100\nhides a lot of stuff that I'd wanna see.\n\n138\n00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.360\nSo I wanna do the true Windows install and\nactually go through this process.\n\n139\n00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.380\nAnd so I'm gonna hit Continue.\n\n140\n00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.330\nAnd now it gives me my hardware summary.\n\n141\n00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.110\nNow it's got a default set of\nhardware that I may or may not like.\n\n142\n00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.060\nOkay, its got a hard drive of 60GB in\nsize maybe that's enough, maybe is not.\n\n143\n00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.440\nIts got 2GB of ram maybe that's enough,\nmaybe is not.\n\n144\n00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.030\nI might need to adjust these.\n\n145\n00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.800\nThe networking is set to\ndo NAT to translate it.\n\n146\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.440\nSo these are all things\nthat might want to adjust.\n\n147\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.640\nSo I can customize those settings and\nI'm going to do that.\n\n148\n00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.820\nIt's asking what name I want to\nname this virtual machine as and\n\n149\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.990\nI'll just call this my Windows 10 Demo.\n\n150\n00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.800\nAnd, now it creates the virtual machine.\n\n151\n00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.390\nThe virtual machine is technically built\nat this point with the default settings\n\n152\n00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.850\nand it's up to me to go in and\nstart tweaking and changing the settings.\n\n153\n00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.220\nNow, I always think about the big 4.\n\n154\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.940\nI start with CPU.\n\n155\n00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.850\nSo, you've got processors and\nmemory over here, and\n\n156\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.810\nnotice the default is 1 processor core.\n\n157\n00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.390\nWell my system has 2\nprocessor cores in it, right?\n\n158\n00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.970\nAnd with hyperthreading I have up\nto 4 threads, blah, blah, blah.\n\n159\n00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.950\nSo if I drop that down, notice how\nI can assign up to 4 cores, right?\n\n160\n00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.880\nI can't go higher because I don't\nhave those, but I can do up to 4.\n\n161\n00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.900\nBut I don't truly have 4 I just have two,\nand\n\n162\n00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.670\nthen hyper-threading it kinda fakes for\nit, right?\n\n163\n00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:20.930\nWell I can leave it at 1, and I would do\nthat if I knew I was gonna have other VMs,\n\n164\n00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.810\nI didn't want this to\nmonopolize the whole system.\n\n165\n00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.140\nBut if I want the best performance\npossible out of this machine\n\n166\n00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.460\nI need to let it know\nthat I have two CPUs.\n\n167\n00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.590\nAnd then that way it can\nuse both of them and\n\n168\n00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.680\nit can thread all of its processes to\nmake sure it takes advantage of that.\n\n169\n00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.900\nI can also adjust my memory right here,\nand you need to recognize that not every\n\n170\n00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.770\nvirtualization platform sets\nthe best level of memory for you.\n\n171\n00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.415\nWhat they normally do is they take\nthe vendors minimum requirements and\n\n172\n00:07:47.415 --> 00:07:48.175\nthey set it to that.\n\n173\n00:07:48.175 --> 00:07:51.119\nSo Microsoft said the minimum\nrequirements recommended here are 2 gigs,\n\n174\n00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:52.202\nthat's what they picked.\n\n175\n00:07:52.202 --> 00:07:56.416\nI've seen somewhere like a Linux and\na little default to 256 MB of RAM.\n\n176\n00:07:56.416 --> 00:07:57.891\nIt'll install that way.\n\n177\n00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:00.561\nBut if you're trying to run a production\nsystem, you're going to need more memory.\n\n178\n00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:02.450\nSo you can just adjust this accordingly,\nright?\n\n179\n00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.620\nSo that's CPU and memory.\n\n180\n00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.440\nThere's two of the big four.\n\n181\n00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.680\nThen, we've got network.\n\n182\n00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.930\nIf I go down to my network,\nit's asking me how I want that connected.\n\n183\n00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.850\nWell, I could do share with my Mac.\n\n184\n00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.500\nIn which case I'm gonna get NATted.\n\n185\n00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.130\nI'll get a fake IP,\nin some RFC 1918 IP range that's fake.\n\n186\n00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.320\nAnd then I'll get NATted to go out\nwith real IPs onto the internet.\n\n187\n00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.390\nOr, I could bridge to one\nof my physical adapters.\n\n188\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.660\nOr I could use one of the virtual\nswitches that I made for\n\n189\n00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.340\nsome of my other segments, right?\n\n190\n00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.680\nBut in this case, I want a bridge.\n\n191\n00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.380\nI'm gonna bridge to my\nthunderbolt adapter.\n\n192\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.420\nAnd that way when this system boots up,\n\n193\n00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.730\nit will think it's physically\nconnected to that thunderbolt adapter.\n\n194\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.230\nIt will see the studio network and\n\n195\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.180\nit will get an IP address\nfrom that studio network.\n\n196\n00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.590\nAll right.\n\n197\n00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.970\nIf I had VLAN settings and all that I\ncould go into advanced and set those,\n\n198\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.380\nbut I don't need those.\n\n199\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.870\nAnd the last part was disk.\n\n200\n00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.160\nAnd if I take a look at it here, it made\none disk for me that's 60 gigs in size.\n\n201\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.740\nI might want to make that bigger or\nsmaller.\n\n202\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.060\nIf you wanna make it bigger,\nthat's easy, you can do that any time.\n\n203\n00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.770\nMaking it smaller is hard, right?\n\n204\n00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:03.850\nBecause I might have data in there.\n\n205\n00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.390\nSo I've gotta make sure\nI have empty space, and\n\n206\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.330\nthey can collapse down, it's actually\npretty challenging to make it smaller.\n\n207\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.990\nSo I really wanna pick just\nthe smallest I can get away with, but\n\n208\n00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.620\nnot have to worry about\ngrowing it later on.\n\n209\n00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.860\nNow the reality is,\nit's dynamically provisioned, right?\n\n210\n00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.610\nSo if I look It not pre\nallocate disk space.\n\n211\n00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.480\nSo I can make this as big as I wanted,\nI can make it 500 GB in size.\n\n212\n00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.510\nI don't have 500 GB\nstorage in my laptop but\n\n213\n00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.740\nthat's okay cuz this is not\npre allocating the space.\n\n214\n00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.970\nThe system can grow to 500 GB if you\nwants eventually it'll run out and\n\n215\n00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.380\nthe machine will crash.\n\n216\n00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.510\nBut I can set that,\nI just can't go smaller.\n\n217\n00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.550\nSo it's better to pick a bigger number,\nif you're dynamically provisioning.\n\n218\n00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.020\nBut if you are preallocating,\nif you're doing a fixed provision disk,\n\n219\n00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.460\nyou need to pick exactly what you need,\nright?\n\n220\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.310\nCuz otherwise you can run out of\nspace on your laptop or server.\n\n221\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.690\nAll right so I'll go ahead and\n\n222\n00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.830\nleave that one the way that it is but\nbump it up to 512.\n\n223\n00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.710\nAll right so there we go it converted.\n\n224\n00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.120\nSee how fast that conversion happened?\n\n225\n00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.530\nCuz it's just thin provision,\njust a little file that I had to write.\n\n226\n00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.140\nNext I want to install\nan operating system.\n\n227\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.640\nWell during the wizard it asked\nmy what I wanted to install and\n\n228\n00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.630\nI told it I wanted to install Windows.\n\n229\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.400\nAnd so I pointed it to a disk image.\n\n230\n00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.890\nAnd what it did is it took my CD drive.\n\n231\n00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.280\nAnd it mounted that image in the CD drive.\n\n232\n00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.330\nYour platform may not do that, right?\n\n233\n00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.890\nHyper V never asked me what operating\nsystem I wanted to install.\n\n234\n00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.440\nAnd so I have to go into the settings and\n\n235\n00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.000\nedit the CD drive and\nadd the virtual machine image in there.\n\n236\n00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.070\nRight?\nTo add that ISO to boot off.\n\n237\n00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:29.850\nSo it's here.\n\n238\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.150\nIt's in place.\n\n239\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.480\nSome virtualization platforms,\n\n240\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.790\nnot all, will have an option where\nyou can adjust the boot order.\n\n241\n00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.770\nSee how I've got that startup disk here?\n\n242\n00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.150\nRemember just like on a physical\ncomputer when you boot up,\n\n243\n00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.190\nit'll usually check the CD first.\n\n244\n00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.540\nThen it'll look for\nUSB keys it can boot off of and\n\n245\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.880\nthen it'll look to the hard drive.\n\n246\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.230\nWell you might need to adjust\nthe order that it's booting on.\n\n247\n00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.670\nAnd tell it hey I want to boot from the CD\nor I wanna boot from the hard drive.\n\n248\n00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.450\nBut in my case it'll pick up that CD.\n\n249\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.960\nAll right, so\nnow we've got all those settings in place.\n\n250\n00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.770\nAnd I'm ready to work with\nthis Windows 10 machine, okay?\n\n251\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.890\nNow, the first time I booted up,\nthe hard drive is blank.\n\n252\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.500\nSo, there's no hard drive to boot off of,\n\n253\n00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.980\nit's gonna boot off that CD disc\nthat is mounted that ISO image.\n\n254\n00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.500\nAnd so, when I hit power, it's booting up.\n\n255\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.670\nI see what's sort of like a BIOS screen,\nright?\n\n256\n00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.460\nAnd then,\nit's starting to boot Windows 10.\n\n257\n00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.720\nAnd from this point on,\n\n258\n00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.320\nI work with it just like I was\non a regular desktop computer.\n\n259\n00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.080\nThis could be a CentOS server.\n\n260\n00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.700\nThis could be a Windows 2012 Server.\n\n261\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.870\nThis could be a Windows 10 workstation.\n\n262\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.890\nIt could be, anything, really.\n\n263\n00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.160\nYou can bring these up and\nget them up and running.\n\n264\n00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.040\nNow one question I get a lot is,\nwell, what about Mac OS?\n\n265\n00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.800\nOS 10, right?\n\n266\n00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.500\nApple has it in their rules.\n\n267\n00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.820\nWe are only allowed to virtualize OS 10\nif you're running on top of OS 10, right.\n\n268\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:52.020\nSo VMware ESX, not allowed to do it,\nHyper-V, not allowed to do it.\n\n269\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.350\nEven VirtualBox on the other platforms,\nnot allowed to do it, right.\n\n270\n00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:59.570\nBut when you're running on top of OS\n10 like I am, you are allowed to do it.\n\n271\n00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.750\nAnd you'll see I've got a couple\nof them here in the background.\n\n272\n00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.110\nSo I'm going to VM refusion but\n\n273\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.620\nvirtual box, parallel desktop,\nthey'll all do it too.\n\n274\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.320\nSo I've got some OS 10 clients\nthat are kinda parked back there.\n\n275\n00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.220\nSo, if you want to do that you\njust have to actually be running\n\n276\n00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.480\non top of mac OS in the first place.\n\n277\n00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.080\nAll right now I just see\nthe regular windows installers.\n\n278\n00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.140\nIf I had chosen VM ware's easy installer\nit would have gone through and\n\n279\n00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.530\nalready answered these for me.\n\n280\n00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.040\nBut, in my case I turn that off, so I have\nto go through and do the install myself.\n\n281\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.090\nAnd when I do the install, remember\nthis virtual machine, it's seeing all\n\n282\n00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.140\nthe virtual hardware as real hardware,\nit doesn't know the difference.\n\n283\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.020\nAnd so it's gonna see that 512 gig hard\ndrive and it's gonna ask me to format it.\n\n284\n00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.870\nBecause it's a blank hard drive.\n\n285\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:40.710\nOr its gonna ask me for a key I've got\nan eval key parked right here can punch in\n\n286\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:45.030\nand so its gonna ask me this stuff and its\nnot gonna make any differentiation between\n\n287\n00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:50.880\nthis being a physical server or\na virtual server it really doesn't know.\n\n288\n00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.090\nWell I guess I shouldn't say that windows\nis smart windows will know its virtualized\n\n289\n00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.850\nright but\nwhat does it do with that knowledge?\n\n290\n00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:01.270\nWith great knowledge comes great I\ndon't know, power of responsibility or\n\n291\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:01.805\nsomething.\n\n292\n00:13:01.805 --> 00:13:03.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, basically what it does is,\n\n293\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.660\nif it knows that it's being virtualized,\nit can take steps to optimize that,\n\n294\n00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.450\nto perform nicely and\n\n295\n00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.890\nto get the best performance possible out\nof the environment that you're running in.\n\n296\n00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.120\nAnd so, when it boots up, Windows may or\n\n297\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.920\nmay not know that you're on\na virtualization platform.\n\n298\n00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.090\nYou might have to teach it, to tell it\nthat you are on a virtualization platform\n\n299\n00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.540\nAnd the way you do that is by installing\nwhat are called the guest tools.\n\n300\n00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.140\nAnd different companies have\ndifferent names for it.\n\n301\n00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.640\nVMware likes to call\nthem the VMware Tools or\n\n302\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.860\nthe VMware editions,\nis two different names.\n\n303\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.290\nVirtualBox, they call them\nthe VirtualBox guest tools.\n\n304\n00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.810\nAnd then in Hyper-V, they have a few\ndifferent names, they actually call them\n\n305\n00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.870\nthe Enlightenment Services,\nwhich is kind of an annoying name.\n\n306\n00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:48.650\nBut what it is is a set of software you\ninstall on the Virtual Machine that lets\n\n307\n00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:53.180\nit know that you've got a virtualization\nhypervisor under the hood and\n\n308\n00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.690\nthat you're not talking\ndirectly to the hardware.\n\n309\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.740\nYou're actually talking to the hypervisor\nthat's allowing you to get\n\n310\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.890\nto the hardware.\n\n311\n00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.330\nAnd the way we communicate with it\nneeds to be a little bit special.\n\n312\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.510\nSo when we do an install like this,\ninstalling those virtual machine tools,\n\n313\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.990\nthose additions,\nis gonna be really important.\n\n314\n00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.680\nAll right?\n\n315\n00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.670\nNow Windows has the HyperV\nadditions built into it.\n\n316\n00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:16.440\nAnd Linux generally has the VMware and\nHyperV tools built into it.\n\n317\n00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.230\nBut I'm installing\nWindows on top of VMware.\n\n318\n00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.130\nAnd Microsoft doesn't, they don't do that.\n\n319\n00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.390\nThey don't package\nthe VMware tools in Windows.\n\n320\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.030\nSo when this one boots up,\nit's not gonna be aware of VMware.\n\n321\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.110\nSo I'm gonna have to install the tools so\nit'll know that and\n\n322\n00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.950\nI'll show you those guest\neditions at the end.\n\n323\n00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.170\nAll right, so\nhere is that 512 GB hard drive and\n\n324\n00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.680\nit's showing as unallocated space,\nnot used for anything.\n\n325\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.430\nIf I'm gonna install it,\nit's just gonna reformat it.\n\n326\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.610\nSo, I'm gonna select that and\nit'll format it for me.\n\n327\n00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.710\nAnd now, it's got that 512 GB drive and\nit's gonna start doing my install, right?\n\n328\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:50.180\nNow, if you're installing from an ISO\ninto the install, actually it goes pretty\n\n329\n00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.420\nquick, but that's gonna turn along and\nit's gonna get installed once it's done,\n\n330\n00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.260\nit'll be up and running, and\nbasically boot into Windows 10, and\n\n331\n00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.610\nthere will be a little more\nset up you have to do.\n\n332\n00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.510\nYou have to give it a username, and\na password, and you gotta pick your theme,\n\n333\n00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.320\nwhat colors you want, and\nall that crazy stuff.\n\n334\n00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.560\n>> Very important.\n\n335\n00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.600\n>> Just like a physical machine.\n\n336\n00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.120\nIt is all kinda pointless.\n\n337\n00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.390\nBut it does have to get done.\n\n338\n00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.730\nIt doesn't necessarily know\nthat it's virtual, right?\n\n339\n00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.640\nThe way we teach it that it's\nvirtual is by giving it guest tools.\n\n340\n00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.040\nSo, while that's messing around\nlet me fire up another machine.\n\n341\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.870\nActually, you know what, I'm gonna run out\nof memory here so let me, [LAUGH] I've\n\n342\n00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:25.010\nonly got so much RAM in this machine, so\n>> That brings up a great\n\n343\n00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:25.680\npoint though, right?\n\n344\n00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.690\nThat you have to allocate the amount\nof RAM that you actually have and\n\n345\n00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.960\nif you don't have it it's not gonna work.\n\n346\n00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.320\nLet me, I'm gonna pause this machine.\n\n347\n00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.460\nAnd I know I've got a couple others\nrunning, so I'm gonna suspend out a few.\n\n348\n00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.580\nAnd you can track all this\nstuff on your system.\n\n349\n00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.310\nSo like here on a MAC I've\ngot the Activity Monitor.\n\n350\n00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.420\nIn Windows you've got the Task Manager or\nthe Performance Monitor.\n\n351\n00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.380\nIn ESX it's got its own reporting\npanels inside of vSphere, in vCenter.\n\n352\n00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.067\nBut you can always jump in and check your\nCPU and memory, and see how you're doing.\n\n353\n00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:54.989\nBut looking at mine,\nsee how I've got 16 gigs of RAM, and\n\n354\n00:15:54.989 --> 00:15:57.105\nI'm currently using 10.5 gigs of it.\n\n355\n00:15:57.105 --> 00:16:00.077\nMost of that is being eaten\nup by my virtual machines, so\n\n356\n00:16:00.077 --> 00:16:04.379\nwhen I come up here and look, well, it's\nactually kind of funny cuz when you look\n\n357\n00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:07.226\nsee how my number one is\na kernel_task at 1.2 GB and\n\n358\n00:16:07.226 --> 00:16:10.500\nthen I've got Chrome eating\nup memory like it does.\n\n359\n00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.650\nVMware Fusion's only showing 136 MB.\n\n360\n00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:14.790\nWhere's all the extra stuff?\n\n361\n00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.715\nWell, when you've got\nhardware-assisted virtual machines,\n\n362\n00:16:19.715 --> 00:16:22.277\nthey're allowed to directly\ntalk to the RAM, and so\n\n363\n00:16:22.277 --> 00:16:25.260\nyour host OS doesn't necessarily\nknow that's being used.\n\n364\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.099\nAnd so\nit recognizes that it's low on RAM but\n\n365\n00:16:27.099 --> 00:16:29.987\nit doesn't necessarily know where\nit's coming from because we're\n\n366\n00:16:29.987 --> 00:16:33.038\ngoing straight kind of around this\nreporting system so we don't see it.\n\n367\n00:16:33.038 --> 00:16:34.617\nThat's kind of a key thing.\n\n368\n00:16:34.617 --> 00:16:36.173\nThese numbers can be wrong sometimes.\n\n369\n00:16:36.173 --> 00:16:38.480\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna fire up a different machine.\n\n370\n00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.050\nI've got this Windows 7 Enterprise\nmachine sitting in the background.\n\n371\n00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:42.880\nActually, I haven't looked\nat this one in a while, so\n\n372\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.120\nI'm curious to see what it's doing.\n\n373\n00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.960\nBut when it comes up, it's Windows 7.\n\n374\n00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.930\nAnd Windows 7 absolutely doesn't have\nthe VMware tools installed on it.\n\n375\n00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.670\nI may have installed them on here.\n\n376\n00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:55.170\nBut basically when you have a new\nmachine come up, and you created it\n\n377\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.630\ninside your virtualization platform,\nthe next part is installing those tools.\n\n378\n00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.408\nAnd your platform will usually have\ndifferent ways for doing that, but\n\n379\n00:17:02.408 --> 00:17:04.760\ntypically you fire the virtual machine.\n\n380\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.240\nAnd in the menu bar for your application\nup top, you'll see a bunch of different\n\n381\n00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:15.910\noptions and usually there will be a menu\nitem that says something like this.\n\n382\n00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.790\nSee how mine says Reinstall VMware Tools.\n\n383\n00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.260\nThat means I've already got them on here,\nit sees them.\n\n384\n00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.340\nIt knows that it can talk to that machine\nand it's letting me reinstall them.\n\n385\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:31.350\nOn Xenserver,\non ESX like with Vsphere, in Hyper-V,\n\n386\n00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.460\nthey all have a menu item similar to\nthis but with the name of their tools.\n\n387\n00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.580\nAnd when you install it,\nit's installing a series of drivers,\n\n388\n00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.530\nare really all they are, custom drivers,\nso that your virtual machine\n\n389\n00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:45.490\nwill understand that it's running\non top of virtual hardware.\n\n390\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.550\nSo when you choose to install\nthe virtual machine tools,\n\n391\n00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.160\nwhat it's normally doing, great,\nnow I've gotta remember my password.\n\n392\n00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:01.980\nWhat it's normally doing\nis it is inserting a image,\n\n393\n00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:07.480\na disk image, like an ISO or something\nlike that, so that you'll have access.\n\n394\n00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.220\nGee whiz,\nit doesn't help you with your password!\n\n395\n00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:09.770\nThere we go.\nSo\n\n396\n00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.910\nthat you'll have access to\nthe drivers to install.\n\n397\n00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.600\nSo it's no different than\ninstalling any other software.\n\n398\n00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.552\nWhen you choose to install those\nvirtual tools, if you browse into your\n\n399\n00:18:18.552 --> 00:18:21.690\nFile Explorer or whatever operating\nsystem it is that you're using,\n\n400\n00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.650\nyou'll usually see a virtual CD.\n\n401\n00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.980\nSo here's my CD drive,\nand it's the VMware Tools.\n\n402\n00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.560\nAnd if I browse into that,\nthere's an autorun for it, and\n\n403\n00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.980\nhere's a 32-bit and 64-bit installers.\n\n404\n00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.209\nAnd I can just run that\nto install the tools.\n\n405\n00:18:35.209 --> 00:18:38.506\nAnd the wizards usually don't\nhave any options whatsoever.\n\n406\n00:18:38.506 --> 00:18:41.176\nYou usually just hit Next ten times and\nit's done.\n\n407\n00:18:41.176 --> 00:18:44.774\nSo when I run this one it's offering\nto install the VMware tools, and\n\n408\n00:18:44.774 --> 00:18:46.260\nI'll just hit Next.\n\n409\n00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.678\nBecause mine are installed,\nI can repair or modify.\n\n410\n00:18:49.678 --> 00:18:51.680\nI'll do modify.\n\n411\n00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.300\nSo when I modify I can see all the\ndifferent pieces of it, and this is what I\n\n412\n00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.220\nreally want to show you guys,\nSee how these are VMware Device Drivers?\n\n413\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.380\nAnd it's got drivers for\nthe Paravirtual SCSI.\n\n414\n00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.010\nMy laptop doesn't have\na SCSI subsystem in it.\n\n415\n00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.510\nIt's SATA.\n\n416\n00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:08.000\nBut VMware is creating\na fake SCSI connection for\n\n417\n00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.410\nthe hard drive in this system.\n\n418\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:14.120\nAnd it's doing that because it can do it\nfaster than a straight SATA communication.\n\n419\n00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.640\nIt's saying, hey,\nyou just send me SCSI communications and\n\n420\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.940\nthis is the driver to do it.\n\n421\n00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.750\nAnd we've got it optimized where we\ncan roll that into our regular kernel\n\n422\n00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:25.220\ncommunications, right into the storage,\nand optimize that.\n\n423\n00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.260\nI'm seeing that here on\na Type 2 hypervisor.\n\n424\n00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.720\nOn a Type 1 hypervisor\nyou might not have that.\n\n425\n00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.340\nYou might have VTD and direct disk access,\nin which case you wouldn't need that.\n\n426\n00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.000\nI see Virtual Printing.\n\n427\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.080\nAny printer that's installed on my host OS\nwill be visible here inside of my guest OS\n\n428\n00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.640\nwithout having to set up drivers and\nall that mess.\n\n429\n00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:48.410\nMemory Control Driver, if I'm doing\nshared memory, the host OS needs to know\n\n430\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:53.440\nhow much memory the guest OS is using,\nand it uses this special driver to do it.\n\n431\n00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.220\nNormally you could use things\nlike SNMP over a network.\n\n432\n00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.540\nBut what if this virtual machine\ndoesn't have a network card?\n\n433\n00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.700\nWhat if it's isolated?\n\n434\n00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.815\nWe need a way to talk to it\nwithout using the network and\n\n435\n00:20:01.815 --> 00:20:02.951\nthis driver lets it happen.\n\n436\n00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:06.855\nThe USB and PS2 Mouse Drivers,\nthose are so my mouse can come in and\n\n437\n00:20:06.855 --> 00:20:08.547\nout of the virtual machine.\n\n438\n00:20:08.547 --> 00:20:10.567\nIt's something I haven't really shown.\n\n439\n00:20:10.567 --> 00:20:14.159\nWhen you have a virtual machine\nwith no guest tools installed,\n\n440\n00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:18.290\nit doesn't necessarily know\nthat it's in a virtual machine.\n\n441\n00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:22.300\nAnd so what you may find is that when you\ngo to start using it, so you might have it\n\n442\n00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:26.350\nin a window like this and you click inside\nthe window, and your mouse gets captured.\n\n443\n00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.260\nIf you think about a normal computer,\n\n444\n00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.060\nwhat happens to your mouse when\nyou get to the edge of the screen?\n\n445\n00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.240\nIt stops, right?\n\n446\n00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.530\nMy mouse moves over to the edge and\nit stops.\n\n447\n00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.650\nIt doesn't go any further\nthan that right there.\n\n448\n00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.830\nBut in a virtual machine, technically\nthe edge is not the edge of the monitor.\n\n449\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.490\nSo when my mouse reaches the edge\nover here, it crosses over and\n\n450\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.080\nI'm back in my regular desktop.\n\n451\n00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.970\nComputers are not designed to do that,\nwell, operating systems are not designed.\n\n452\n00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.290\nOperating systems are designed\nto stop it right there.\n\n453\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.970\nAnd so when you install an operating\nsystem that doesn't have\n\n454\n00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.690\nthe virtual machine tools installed,\n\n455\n00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.260\nit will stop your mouse right\nat the edge and you're trapped.\n\n456\n00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.130\nAnd so usually you'll see some onscreen\nwarning, down at the bottom of your screen\n\n457\n00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.110\nor up top,\nthat'll tell you how to release the mouse.\n\n458\n00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.090\nIf the mouse is trapped,\nhere's how you release it to get it out.\n\n459\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.042\nAnd on VMware, it's Ctrl+Alt usually.\n\n460\n00:21:18.042 --> 00:21:20.883\nSometimes it's your right Alt key or\nyour left Alt key,\n\n461\n00:21:20.883 --> 00:21:23.313\nit just depends on\nthe platform you're using.\n\n462\n00:21:23.313 --> 00:21:24.637\nIt'll have a different keyboard shortcut.\n\n463\n00:21:24.637 --> 00:21:27.720\nAnd it'll release your mouse and\nget it out of the virtual machine.\n\n464\n00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.190\nBut once you have the tools installed like\nI do, you can freely move your mouse in\n\n465\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.860\nand out of the install, and it's this\ndriver here that's letting you do it.\n\n466\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.550\nIt's removing that edge detection that\nallows the mouse to exit the screen.\n\n467\n00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.920\nYou'll also see I've got a video card\ndriver, a sound driver and so on.\n\n468\n00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.900\nThis is a Type 2 hypervisor.\n\n469\n00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.800\nOn a Type 2 hypervisor all\nof your hardware is fake.\n\n470\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:54.588\nSo I've got a fake SVGA video card,\na fake audio driver, a fake NIC.\n\n471\n00:21:54.588 --> 00:21:57.770\nAll of this hardware is completely fake,\nand\n\n472\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.420\nthese are the drivers that support that.\n\n473\n00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.110\nI need these tools for\nmy fake hardware to work.\n\n474\n00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.270\nOn a Type 1 hypervisor you might\nnot have half of this stuff,\n\n475\n00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.090\nbecause a lot of it's the real hardware.\n\n476\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.900\nSo those are some of the different\nthings that you get.\n\n477\n00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.823\nYou'll see I've got volume shadow copy\nsupport for snapshots and I've got shared\n\n478\n00:22:12.823 --> 00:22:16.482\nfolder support where I can share files\nbetween my host OS and the guest OS too.\n\n479\n00:22:16.482 --> 00:22:19.872\nAll of these are provided by the guest\ntools, so all kind of important.\n\n480\n00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:24.809\n>> Now Don, one of the cool benefits\nof virtualization is the ability to\n\n481\n00:22:24.809 --> 00:22:29.323\nactually create a template so\nthat we can have an easily rapidly\n\n482\n00:22:29.323 --> 00:22:33.943\ndeployed system that has a basic\nbuild that we're looking for.\n\n483\n00:22:33.943 --> 00:22:36.235\nAnd that can be really helpful\nin a production environment.\n\n484\n00:22:36.235 --> 00:22:40.480\n>> Yeah, let's say I'm a developer and\nI'm working on a web server.\n\n485\n00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.140\nI try something out and it hoses\neverything up and I'm like well, shoot,\n\n486\n00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.890\nlet me throw that away and\ncreate a new one.\n\n487\n00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.190\nI don't want to have to go through\nthe process of reinstalling the operating\n\n488\n00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.745\nsystem and getting everything\nconfigured and installed.\n\n489\n00:22:49.745 --> 00:22:53.100\nIt'd be nice if I could just spin up\nnew machines at a moment's notice, and\n\n490\n00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.290\nyou certainly can.\n\n491\n00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:57.490\nWhen you create a virtual machine,\nyou can turn it into a template.\n\n492\n00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.310\nAnd a template can be cloned\nas many times as you need it.\n\n493\n00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:04.090\nSo if I wanna spin up more virtual\nmachines, I can clone them and off I go.\n\n494\n00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.460\nAnd there's some other technologies too,\nlike Snapshots and so\n\n495\n00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.190\non that can help, but\ncloning is one of the nice ones.\n\n496\n00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.270\nNow if you're cloning, so for example,\nI've got a CentOS box right here, so\n\n497\n00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.680\na CentOS Linux.\n\n498\n00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.977\nAnd if I need a second Linux box,\nI can just take this one and copy it.\n\n499\n00:23:18.977 --> 00:23:22.530\nWell, if I've got a bunch of stuff\ncustomized and installed on there,\n\n500\n00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.317\nnow it's a very specific machine.\n\n501\n00:23:24.317 --> 00:23:25.803\nI might not want a clone of that.\n\n502\n00:23:25.803 --> 00:23:29.876\nSo what I might choose to do is do\nan install of Linux that's just a base\n\n503\n00:23:29.876 --> 00:23:30.700\ninstall.\n\n504\n00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.160\nHere's the basic installation that I need.\n\n505\n00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.350\nAnd whenever I need new ones,\nI can just clone it.\n\n506\n00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.360\nI've actually done that.\n\n507\n00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.630\nThat's what this guy is right here,\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n508\n00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:44.208\nWhat that is is a virtual machine where\nI installed Windows Server 2012, and\n\n509\n00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:45.565\nI did the bare minimum.\n\n510\n00:23:45.565 --> 00:23:49.534\nJust go it installed, and\ndid all the available Windows updates, and\n\n511\n00:23:49.534 --> 00:23:50.684\nthen I shut it down.\n\n512\n00:23:50.684 --> 00:23:55.431\nAnd whenever I need a new virtual machine,\nI just right-click on that.\n\n513\n00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:58.927\nAnd you'll see where you've got\nthis Create a Clone option, okay?\n\n514\n00:23:58.927 --> 00:24:01.492\nAnd mine's grayed out right now,\nwhich I'm not sure why,\n\n515\n00:24:01.492 --> 00:24:03.664\nprobably cuz I'm out of hard drive space,\nbut a.\n\n516\n00:24:03.664 --> 00:24:08.480\n[LAUGH] So, but you can create a clone and\nthat will create that second machine.\n\n517\n00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.920\nI'm using this as a template.\n\n518\n00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.470\nNow for a Linux machine,\nyou can clone anything you want, right?\n\n519\n00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:16.650\nSo I could take like this CentOS box,\nand I could go in and\n\n520\n00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:20.010\ncreate that full clone right there and\nit's ready to go, all right?\n\n521\n00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.520\nAnd it's a smaller image, I guess,\nso I got my option right there.\n\n522\n00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.330\nBut on a Windows machine,\nit's a little different.\n\n523\n00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.070\nOn a Windows machine you have a security\nidentifier tied to your machine,\n\n524\n00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.120\nand if I just go and clone this one\nmachine over, and over, and over again,\n\n525\n00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.430\nI'm gonna have a bunch of computers\nwith the same security identifier.\n\n526\n00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.395\nSo if you're gonna create a template,\n\n527\n00:24:37.395 --> 00:24:41.098\none of the things you need to do is\nwhat's called generalizing your data.\n\n528\n00:24:41.098 --> 00:24:44.535\nYou need to make that install nice and\ngeneric, right?\n\n529\n00:24:44.535 --> 00:24:49.163\nAnd if we take my Windows 10 install,\nwhich I stopped that one, didn't I?\n\n530\n00:24:49.163 --> 00:24:52.135\nShoot, well I can take\nthis Windows 7 machine.\n\n531\n00:24:52.135 --> 00:24:57.195\nIf I had this Windows 7 machine and I\nwanted to turn this into a template that I\n\n532\n00:24:57.195 --> 00:25:02.275\ncould use, or I think I've got a Server\nmachine fired up, here sever 03.\n\n533\n00:25:02.275 --> 00:25:04.412\nLet's tackle one of my other servers,\nor server 02,\n\n534\n00:25:04.412 --> 00:25:06.370\nI don't even know what this server does.\n\n535\n00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.230\nSo I'll take this server.\n\n536\n00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.650\nIt's running Windows Server 2012 R2.\n\n537\n00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:09.890\nI wanna make it a template.\n\n538\n00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:14.510\nSo I boot it up, I get it all installed\nand configured, I do all the Windows\n\n539\n00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.490\nupdates, maybe I've got some antivirus\nsoftware that I use in my company so\n\n540\n00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:21.150\nI install that, or\nwhatever it is that we use in our company,\n\n541\n00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.220\nwe get it all installed,\neven the wallpaper.\n\n542\n00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:29.650\nThen, if I want to make it a template,\nI need to shut it down and\n\n543\n00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.220\nstop using it and\nthen I can clone it as I want.\n\n544\n00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.060\nAnd in Zen Center, Citrix Zen Center,\n\n545\n00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.630\nthey have a neat feature where you can\nactually put it aside into a library and\n\n546\n00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.210\nthen you can clone it out of\na library whenever you want.\n\n547\n00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.470\nThat stops people from turning it on,\n\n548\n00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.330\nbecause technically you can\nturn this on whenever you want.\n\n549\n00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.880\nI like to leave it where I can turn it on\ncuz I might wanna continue to do updates\n\n550\n00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.810\nto it, right, tweaks to that image.\n\n551\n00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.730\nBut it's not generalized.\n\n552\n00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.188\nThis server's got a name, right?\n\n553\n00:25:50.188 --> 00:25:53.762\nIt's got a name, which we can no\nlonger see, of Server03, and so\n\n554\n00:25:53.762 --> 00:25:56.548\nif I start cloning it,\nI'm gonna, or server 02.\n\n555\n00:25:56.548 --> 00:25:59.648\nI'm gonna have a fleet of computers\nthat are all called server 02.\n\n556\n00:25:59.648 --> 00:26:03.088\nAnd, this one's joined to a domain, right?\n\n557\n00:26:03.088 --> 00:26:04.868\nSo it's tied to an active\ndirectory domain.\n\n558\n00:26:04.868 --> 00:26:07.606\nAnd if I clone this, now I've got two\nmachines with the same name in the same\n\n559\n00:26:07.606 --> 00:26:09.930\ndomain, it's gonna screw everything up.\n\n560\n00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.530\nSo I need to generalize this machine,\nI need to make it generic.\n\n561\n00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.090\nAnd the way you do that in Windows is\nby using Sysprep, Sysprep's a utility,\n\n562\n00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:21.580\nit's actually built into the system\nif I browse on my hard drive here.\n\n563\n00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:27.326\nI'm gonna browse into Windows and\nsystem32 and\n\n564\n00:26:27.326 --> 00:26:32.166\nsysprep if I remember right,\nthere it is, and I can run sysprep.\n\n565\n00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:32.836\nAnd what it is,\n\n566\n00:26:32.836 --> 00:26:35.983\na little utility that basically digs\nthrough the registry of Windows and\n\n567\n00:26:35.983 --> 00:26:39.298\nall the other settings, it looks for\nanything that would be a unique value.\n\n568\n00:26:39.298 --> 00:26:41.549\nSomething that would apply\njust to this server and\n\n569\n00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:43.280\nit strips it out and gets rid of it.\n\n570\n00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.850\nThrows it away, right?\n\n571\n00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:49.220\nAnd so, if I do that, if I tell\nit to generalize this system, and\n\n572\n00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:54.930\nthen shut down, when that's done, this\nmachine will have no unique data anymore,\n\n573\n00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:58.230\nbut it'll have a full install\nof Windows with all the updates,\n\n574\n00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.350\nwith my third-party software installed,\nand now I can just clone it\n\n575\n00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:05.590\nto my heart's content and spin up new\nones and kind of run with that, right?\n\n576\n00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.750\nSo, if I do that, here's Sysprep running,\nand then as soon as it's done,\n\n577\n00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.540\nit's gonna shut the machine down.\n\n578\n00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.680\nAnd then once it's shut down,\nI just clone it out.\n\n579\n00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.930\nWhenever I clone it and spin up a new\nmachine, it's gonna ask me, hey,\n\n580\n00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.310\nwhat do you wanna name this machine?\n\n581\n00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.405\nWell actually Windows will generate\na fake name now, but you know,\n\n582\n00:27:19.405 --> 00:27:20.460\nyou can reassign it.\n\n583\n00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.860\nIt'll ask you for, you know, a couple\nother basic settings before it fires up,\n\n584\n00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:27.380\nand now you can quickly provision\nthose machines, and that's a really\n\n585\n00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.930\nnice feature of doing cloud services\nlike this, rapid provisioning.\n\n586\n00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.870\nAnd you see that in the big\ncloud services too,\n\n587\n00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:39.450\nlike in Windows Azure or let's see,\nwhere do I have that part?\n\n588\n00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.050\nSomewhere around here.\n\n589\n00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:44.540\nHere, so I'm in Amazon AWS,\nAmazon Web Services.\n\n590\n00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:48.430\nIf I need a Linux server,\nI'm not installing Linux on this machine.\n\n591\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.110\nWhen I jump into EC2 and\nI tell it to spin something up, or\n\n592\n00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.580\neven a Windows server, right?\n\n593\n00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.238\nI can jump into my instances and I can\ntell it, hey, I want a Windows server.\n\n594\n00:27:56.238 --> 00:28:00.108\nSo I'm gonna launch an instance and\nI'm gonna pick from the images and\n\n595\n00:28:00.108 --> 00:28:04.578\nI'm gonna pick a Windows server right\nhere, Windows Server 2012 R2 base.\n\n596\n00:28:04.578 --> 00:28:06.098\nSo I'm going to select that one.\n\n597\n00:28:06.098 --> 00:28:08.230\nI'm not going to install Windows,\nthey've already done it for me.\n\n598\n00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.440\nThey have an image that's\nalready got it installed,\n\n599\n00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.218\nthat's already got the updates applied.\n\n600\n00:28:12.218 --> 00:28:18.042\nAnd so I can come in and pick what I want\nthat image to be, and we can launch it,\n\n601\n00:28:18.042 --> 00:28:23.229\nand when it does that its going to\ndeploy very, very quickly because\n\n602\n00:28:23.229 --> 00:28:28.428\nits not having to install Windows\nits just having to clone an image.\n\n603\n00:28:28.428 --> 00:28:30.935\nAnd so there it is and\nits initializing right now,\n\n604\n00:28:30.935 --> 00:28:35.050\nthat means its cloning the image and\nthen I'm gonna see it go and start up.\n\n605\n00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.520\nAnd it'll start up, and then when\nit's done I'll have Windows up and\n\n606\n00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.750\nrunning ready for\nme to access it and use it.\n\n607\n00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.150\nThat's one of the really cool parts\nabout doing virtualization like this,\n\n608\n00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.540\nis we can rapidly deploy it.\n\n609\n00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.716\nSo if I need a new web\nserver to test with, or\n\n610\n00:28:46.716 --> 00:28:50.041\nI just need a new web server to make\nup for excess load on my system,\n\n611\n00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:53.148\nthings are getting really busy,\nI need another web server.\n\n612\n00:28:53.148 --> 00:28:55.848\nI can just clone one,\nand its up and its done.\n\n613\n00:28:55.848 --> 00:28:59.048\nI don't have to do the install and\nconfiguration and all that other stuff.\n\n614\n00:28:59.048 --> 00:29:02.028\nSo, having templates like these,\nreally, really useful.\n\n615\n00:29:02.028 --> 00:29:03.248\n>> Definitely very useful.\n\n616\n00:29:03.248 --> 00:29:04.508\n>> All ready running.\n\n617\n00:29:04.508 --> 00:29:05.750\n>> Party hardy going.\n\n618\n00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.944\nDon is all ready to use, and\nthis is a public cloud as well, but\n\n619\n00:29:08.944 --> 00:29:13.370\nwe've been basically looking at private\nvirtualization, and private cloud type,\n\n620\n00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:14.800\nbut this is a public cloud.\n\n621\n00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.640\nIt's very nice.\n\n622\n00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.070\nThey got a whole library of different\ntemplates that you can use or\n\n623\n00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.635\nyou can create your own, it's very,\nvery handy and we like it a lot.\n\n624\n00:29:22.635 --> 00:29:25.990\nAnd that being said Don, I know we have\none more topic that we want to go over.\n\n625\n00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:27.558\nDo we want to make it\n>> Let's roll that\n\n626\n00:29:27.558 --> 00:29:28.520\noff into a separate episode\n>> Okay.\n\n627\n00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.496\n>> But we didn't talk about snap shots and\nsnap shots are one of the coolest features\n\n628\n00:29:31.496 --> 00:29:34.570\nof having a virtualized environment,\nso I definitely want to tackle those.\n\n629\n00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.080\nWe'll just make it into\na separate episode.\n\n630\n00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.860\n>> All right then.\n\n631\n00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:37.774\nWell, that being said,\n\n632\n00:29:37.774 --> 00:29:40.748\nlooks like we've come to the end of this\nlittle miniseries that we've created.\n\n633\n00:29:40.748 --> 00:29:41.768\nHope you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n634\n00:29:41.768 --> 00:29:46.188\nDon, thank you so much for explaining\nall these concepts and practices to us.\n\n635\n00:29:46.188 --> 00:29:50.530\nWe should be now schooled up and be ready\nto create our own virtual machines.\n\n636\n00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:51.588\nHopefully, you've already done that.\n\n637\n00:29:51.588 --> 00:29:54.248\nThat being said,\nwe're gonna sign off for ITProTV.\n\n638\n00:29:54.248 --> 00:29:55.508\nI've being your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n639\n00:29:55.508 --> 00:29:56.328\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n640\n00:29:56.328 --> 00:29:59.008\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n641\n00:29:59.008 --> 00:30:05.420\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:19.610\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n5\n00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.620\nwe are continuing on with our Cloud plus\nfor CompTIA series we've been working on.\n\n6\n00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.790\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nis our good friend, he is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.410\nDon, welcome back to the show and\nhow are you doing, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.340\n>> I'm doing great, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.160\nThanks for having me back.\n\n10\n00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.550\nAnd once again, jumping right back\ninto the world of virtualization.\n\n11\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.380\nIn this episode we're gonna talk\nabout migrating our resources into\n\n12\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.350\na virtual environment.\n\n13\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.810\nAnd you may be one of the fortune people\nthat goes to work for some company that\n\n14\n00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.650\nhas absolutely nothing, and you build\nthe infrastructure from the ground up.\n\n15\n00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.120\nAnd so\nyou might build it virtual from day one.\n\n16\n00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.110\nBut that is a very rare thing.\n\n17\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.430\nIn fact, you're more likely to have\nan environment where you go and\n\n18\n00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.810\neverything is still all physical.\n\n19\n00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.900\nPhysical servers, and it's up to you to\nmigrate those resources into the virtual\n\n20\n00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.390\nworld to get things efficient,\noptimized and\n\n21\n00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.780\ntake advantage of all the cool stuff that\na virtual environment creates for us.\n\n22\n00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.380\nAnd so that's what we're gonna\ntalk about in this episode.\n\n23\n00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.415\n>> Yeah, unfortunately like Don was saying\nwe are gonna probably have to migrate some\n\n24\n00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:16.010\nsystems at some point in time in your IT\ncareer, it's just kind of part of the job.\n\n25\n00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.550\nSo today is a good day for\n\n26\n00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.020\nyou, because you can kind of get\nahead of that, get in front of it.\n\n27\n00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.970\nAnd we're gonna show you some of the ways\nin which we can use virtualization\n\n28\n00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.990\nto migrate.\n\n29\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.180\nAnd, Don, I guess the good place to\nstart would be is why would we migrate?\n\n30\n00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.210\nIf we can understand\nthe reasoning behind it,\n\n31\n00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.680\nthen we can kinda figure\nout what's going on.\n\n32\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.790\nAll right, so, we've talked about this\na little bit in other episodes, but\n\n33\n00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.080\nwhen you have a physical server in place\nand you deploy an operating system on it,\n\n34\n00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.990\nthe operating system has access to 100%\nof the resources of that hardware, and\n\n35\n00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.980\nit's not shared with anybody else.\n\n36\n00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.830\nNow normally that's not a big deal, but\n\n37\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.490\nthe problem is that servers rarely take\nadvantage of all the resources they have.\n\n38\n00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.280\nYou might have unused hard drive space,\nunused CPU cycles, unused RAM,\n\n39\n00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.190\nthat's sitting there that's extra that you\npurchased cuz you might need it during\n\n40\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.010\npeak time, or you just didn't want\nto upgrade a few years from now.\n\n41\n00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.080\nSo you bought a server that was\nbeefy enough to handle the load, and\n\n42\n00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.940\nit's being wasted.\n\n43\n00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.930\nYou can't share it.\n\n44\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.590\nSo I might have one server with a terabyte\nof extra hard drive space, and I might\n\n45\n00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.630\nhave another server that's completely out\nof resources, out of hard drive space.\n\n46\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.270\nAnd there’s nothing I can do about it\nexcept go and buy more hard drives,\n\n47\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.440\neven though I’ve got extra storage over\nhere that’s not being used, right?\n\n48\n00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.630\nSo the ability to share resources\nbetween systems, that’s one of\n\n49\n00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.480\nthe biggest benefits of virtualizing and\none of the reasons we want to go that way.\n\n50\n00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.430\nThe other thing is cost and\nmaintenance, right?\n\n51\n00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.780\nAnd I see this all the time.\n\n52\n00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.780\nYou go out and you buy a physical server.\n\n53\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.905\nAnd let’s say we go to Dell or\nHP or Lenovo, whoever, and\n\n54\n00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:41.910\nwe just buy the best server we can.\n\n55\n00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.910\nSo we get a server with two processors and\neight cores in each processor.\n\n56\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.170\nWe load up with 64 gigs of RAM and\n\n57\n00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.450\na couple of terabytes of hard drive space,\nand we get that server up and going.\n\n58\n00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.310\nAnd you pay 10, 12 thousand dollars for\na server like that.\n\n59\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.530\nAnd you get a warranty, right?\n\n60\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.760\nAnd that warranty on most servers\nthese days is three years.\n\n61\n00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.210\nSo for three years they're gonna\ncover you parts and labor.\n\n62\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.330\nThat server's gonna be covered.\n\n63\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.250\nYou can pay more if you want to go to the\none hour or four hour response time, and\n\n64\n00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.030\nall that other good stuff.\n\n65\n00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.700\nBut just say the base of\na three year warranty.\n\n66\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.790\nWell, you start running that server, and\nthen the next year and the year after.\n\n67\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.930\nAnd finally you creep\nup on that third year.\n\n68\n00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.500\nAnd the warranty runs out.\n\n69\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.580\nWhat do you do?\n\n70\n00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.340\nWell, the server's still good, right?\n\n71\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.860\nYou bought it nice and\nover specced for what you needed.\n\n72\n00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.250\nIt can keep on running.\n\n73\n00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.440\nSo now you gotta renew that warranty and\nextend it out.\n\n74\n00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.240\nAnd most vendors will extend you\nto four or five years, whatever.\n\n75\n00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.180\nSo you continue to extend that\nhardware out and keep that support,\n\n76\n00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.560\nbecause you wanna get your\nmoney's worth out of that server.\n\n77\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.120\nSo now you've got to track the warranties,\ncuz you don't want it getting out of\n\n78\n00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.550\nwarranty, cuz then if something goes\nwrong and you can't replace the part,\n\n79\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.700\nyou gotta go third party or after market,\nand you get mixed results there.\n\n80\n00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.240\nSo we have a maintenance\nchallenge with that server, and\n\n81\n00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.190\nwe're potentially wasting resources,\ncuz we've got extra resources for\n\n82\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.130\ndown the road versus just\nthe resources we needed right now.\n\n83\n00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.390\nIf we go virtual, we buy physical\nboxes to serve as the virtual hosts.\n\n84\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.870\nBut our guests, the guest OS's,\nthey're just visitors, right?\n\n85\n00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.340\nThey're just software that's\nrunning on top of that.\n\n86\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.230\nAnd the cool part is we can easily\nmove them from hardware to hardware,\n\n87\n00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.520\nin some cases without even\nturning off the machine.\n\n88\n00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.830\nWe'll talk about live\nmigrations in another episode.\n\n89\n00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.950\nBut you can do migrations like that and\nmove a virtual machine from one physical\n\n90\n00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.030\npiece of hardware to another\nphysical piece of hardware.\n\n91\n00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.650\nWithout even turning it off.\n\n92\n00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.500\nAnd so now if I wanna go out and\n\n93\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.230\nbuy a new piece of hardware,\nI can throw it in place.\n\n94\n00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.990\nI can move my VMs to it, and\nmy engines never even know what happened.\n\n95\n00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.810\nVersus if I have a physical server and I\ndecide I want I wanna move my application\n\n96\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.700\nfrom that physical server off\nto another physical server,\n\n97\n00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.650\nI gotta bring up a new server, I've gotta\nreinstall my OS, configure my software,\n\n98\n00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.720\nrestore my backups,\npoint my users over to the new servers.\n\n99\n00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.680\nIt's a lot of work moving from one piece\nof hardware to another, all right.\n\n100\n00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.380\nBut the cool part with virtualization\nis the physical server,\n\n101\n00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.990\nI'm gonna have a warranty,\nI'm gonna have maintenance,\n\n102\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.450\nI'm gonna have all these\nthings that I have to track.\n\n103\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.130\nBut for my guest machines,\nI don't anymore.\n\n104\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.030\nThey're virtual.\nThey have virtual hardware and\n\n105\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.520\nso I have less physical\nservers to maintain.\n\n106\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.390\nLess physical servers to monitor for\noutages, to keep under warranty, to track,\n\n107\n00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.030\nand that burden of maintaining\nthe physical side of things\n\n108\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.060\nstarts to ease off,\ncuz there's less equipment.\n\n109\n00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.430\nAnd I told that story the other\nday about how we reduced the data\n\n110\n00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.200\ncenter that I was working in from\nabout 270 servers, a little bit more.\n\n111\n00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.390\nReduced it down to closer to 100 servers,\nthat you can\n\n112\n00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.560\ndo that when you start virtualizing\nthings and consolidating that space,\n\n113\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.140\nconsolidating those servers down, and it\nmakes administration considerably easier.\n\n114\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.210\nSo those are some of the reasons\nwhy we might want to do this.\n\n115\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.230\nBut there's reasons we might\nnot want to do it too.\n\n116\n00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.640\nWith every good, there's usually a bad.\n\n117\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.410\nSometimes you're gonna\nhave servers that have\n\n118\n00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.810\nreally stringent demands on the hardware.\n\n119\n00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.590\nDatabase servers are a great example.\n\n120\n00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.755\nI might have a database server that needs\nthe fastest possible disk access available\n\n121\n00:05:52.755 --> 00:05:57.570\nand dedicated access to CPUs and\ndedicated access to RAM.\n\n122\n00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.600\nI want performance.\n\n123\n00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.330\nThat's my key component.\n\n124\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.680\nWell, in a properly tuned virtual\nenvironment you can get that performance,\n\n125\n00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.740\nif you take the time and get things for\nyou, you have a type 1 hypervisor,\n\n126\n00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.920\nyou balance your workload and stuff, you\ncan really create the virtual environment.\n\n127\n00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.500\nA lot of organizations\nwon't take that chance,\n\n128\n00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.080\nand they'll say you know what,\nlet's go dedicated hardware.\n\n129\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.460\nWe know that will get us to dedicated\nperformance that we need, and\n\n130\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.580\nwe don't have any risk like\nwe would have going virtual.\n\n131\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.600\nSo that's one scenario, but\nthere's another scenario.\n\n132\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.760\nThere are some servers that\nyou just can't take virtual.\n\n133\n00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.200\nThere are some servers\nthat have special needs or\n\n134\n00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.300\nconfigurations that won't work\nin a virtual environment.\n\n135\n00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.920\nDaniel and I, we used to work at\nan insurance company together.\n\n136\n00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.010\nAnd I don't know if you ever worked,\ndid you work on the GFI Lan Fax Server?\n\n137\n00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.640\n>> No, but\nI've heard horror stories about it.\n\n138\n00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.310\n>> So, it's actually hard for\n\n139\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.855\nme to say the GFI La Fax server without\nputting a cuss word before or after it.\n\n140\n00:06:47.855 --> 00:06:49.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, it was a fax server.\n\n141\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.510\nWe were an insurance company,\nand so we had faxes.\n\n142\n00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.990\nI know a lot of you say faxes, some of\nyou actually say what the heck is a fax?\n\n143\n00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.524\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But for those of you that know,\n\n144\n00:06:57.524 --> 00:06:58.780\nit's not used that much anymore.\n\n145\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.292\nBut when you're dealing with the\ngovernment, when you're submitting forms,\n\n146\n00:07:02.292 --> 00:07:05.090\nand receiving forms,\nfax is still very commonly used.\n\n147\n00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.710\nAnd so we had a server for\nthat, and our desktops\n\n148\n00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.510\nall throughout the organization\ncould connect to the server over IP.\n\n149\n00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.470\nSo just regular network connection.\n\n150\n00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.165\nAnd they could generate a fax,\nsend it over to this server,\n\n151\n00:07:15.165 --> 00:07:19.115\nand the server had 16 or\n24 phone lines in it,\n\n152\n00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:22.355\nI forget how many phone lines were in it,\nbut it was at least 16 phone lines.\n\n153\n00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:24.215\nAnd it would dial out and send the fax.\n\n154\n00:07:24.215 --> 00:07:28.225\nAnd incoming faxes would come into it on\nthose 16 or 24 phone lines and it would go\n\n155\n00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:32.210\ninto these mailboxes to then be sorted and\nsent to the claims adjusters or whoever.\n\n156\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:37.220\nBut the key thing here is that in\nthat server was a physical board.\n\n157\n00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.220\nThis Digicom board or\nI forget who made that thing.\n\n158\n00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.690\nBut this board that had 16\nanalog phone lines in it.\n\n159\n00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.380\nRight?\n\n160\n00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.509\nAnd that board was special.\n\n161\n00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:51.771\nNot special in that several different\ncompanies don't make it, because they do.\n\n162\n00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:56.004\nYou can find several different vendors\nthat do, but it was special in that It's\n\n163\n00:07:56.004 --> 00:08:00.630\nnot common enough that virtualization\nplatform has created an analogue for it.\n\n164\n00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.130\nSo if you have the m ware fusion,\nnot the M ware fusion.\n\n165\n00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.100\nBut the VM ware ESX or Hyper V.\n\n166\n00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.740\nTheir Citrix Zen server or\n\n167\n00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.240\nKVM if you have one of those guys,\nthey don't have a virtual fax board.\n\n168\n00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.730\nThey don't have it, right?\n\n169\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.320\nAnd even if they did,\n\n170\n00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.350\nyou'd have to have fax boards like\nthat in each of your physical servers.\n\n171\n00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.700\nSo if you moved a VM from\none server to another,\n\n172\n00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.040\nthen it would have that fax\nboard there and available to it.\n\n173\n00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.380\nAnd it's really difficult to\nget that kind of thing set up.\n\n174\n00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.160\nSo because we had this special\npiece of hardware in that server,\n\n175\n00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.170\nit had to stay in that server.\n\n176\n00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.230\nIt had to stay physical because\nof the special hardware needs.\n\n177\n00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.450\nSo if you've got proprietary\nmonitoring equipment, fax boards, or\n\n178\n00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.710\nserial boards like these.\n\n179\n00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.400\nIf you've got other types of hardware,\neven software sometimes can be a problem.\n\n180\n00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.060\nFor example, there's some CAD software out\nthere, right, computer design software.\n\n181\n00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.090\nThat the way the licensing is\ndone is with the USB dongle\n\n182\n00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.620\nwhere when you launch the software\nif it doesn't see the USB\n\n183\n00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.420\ndongle it says you're not licensed\nto run this and it doesn't run.\n\n184\n00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.210\nBut if the USB dongle is\nplugged in then it does run,\n\n185\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.930\nit sees its license right there, so\nit's tied to that physical dongle.\n\n186\n00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:08.510\nAnd there's some software like VMware,\nkeep saying fusion.\n\n187\n00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.880\nVMware ESX that will let you\nmap a USB port in if you want.\n\n188\n00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.530\nBut then there's XenServer that won't.\n\n189\n00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.860\nAnd Hyper-V that won't.\n\n190\n00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.840\nAnd I don't think KVM will either.\n\n191\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.660\nSo a lot of the big providers out there\nfor type 1 hypervisors don't support\n\n192\n00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.300\nmapping of physical USB device\ninto a virtual machine.\n\n193\n00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.470\nOr they do support it but\nin some kind of beta or alpha form.\n\n194\n00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.660\nThat's not something really designed for\nproduction.\n\n195\n00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.130\nAnd that would be another example of\nsoftware that might have to stay physical.\n\n196\n00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.600\nSo when you walk into a new company,\nright, so\n\n197\n00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.110\nlet's say you just got hired as a sys\nadmin, you walk into a company.\n\n198\n00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.180\nYou walk into the serve room and\n\n199\n00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.480\nyou're just blown away by the sheer\namount of servers in that room.\n\n200\n00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.530\nDon't immediately say,\n\n201\n00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.990\nI'm gonna virtualize every one of these,\nbecause there is a time.\n\n202\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.720\nThere are scenarios where you're just\nnot able to, or you're able to, but\n\n203\n00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.570\nit's a bad idea, right?\n\n204\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.190\nYou've gotta evaluate that.\n\n205\n00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.400\nPerformance and physical hardware,\n\n206\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.560\nthose are the two things that usually make\nme not virtualize a server, all right?\n\n207\n00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.170\nBut there can be other things.\n\n208\n00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.770\nMainly those are the ones\nthat we wanna consider.\n\n209\n00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.540\n>> Well, Don, obviously, now that we have\nthe reasons why we would, and obviously,\n\n210\n00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.890\nwhy we wouldn't want to virtualize.\n\n211\n00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.050\nWhat are some of the variations\nof virtualization, or\n\n212\n00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.180\nmigration to virtualization\nmight we encounter?\n\n213\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:16.780\n>> All right.\nNow, normally,\n\n214\n00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.740\nwhen we talk about migration,\nwe're talking about one thing.\n\n215\n00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.110\nWe're talking about\ntaking physical servers.\n\n216\n00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.070\nAnd turning them into virtual servers.\n\n217\n00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.570\nAnd they call that P2V.\n\n218\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.450\nP the number 2, V, right.\n\n219\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.330\nPhysical 2 virtual.\n\n220\n00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.010\nAnd so when people say migration that's\nalmost always what they're referring to.\n\n221\n00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.570\nBut on the exam there are two\nother forms that you may see.\n\n222\n00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.300\nSo for example, V2V.\n\n223\n00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.680\nV2V is virtual to virtual.\n\n224\n00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.130\nI might have a server that's\nin a guest VM on HyperV,\n\n225\n00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:48.160\nand I decide I wanna go to VMware,\nand so I bring up VMware EX boxes, and\n\n226\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.400\nnow I wanna migrate to HyperV to VMware,\nor vice versa,\n\n227\n00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.830\nmaybe I wanna move from VMware to\nHyperV and so you can do that, right?\n\n228\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.260\nAnd that would be V to V,\nVirtual to Virtual.\n\n229\n00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.591\nBut then there's also V2P,\nvirtual to physical.\n\n230\n00:11:02.591 --> 00:11:05.042\nThis is where you have\na machine that's virtual and\n\n231\n00:11:05.042 --> 00:11:06.980\nyou move it to a physical installation.\n\n232\n00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.230\nThis is the least common of the three,\nbut it does happen.\n\n233\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.290\nI'll give you a great example.\n\n234\n00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:15.760\nI use to work for a bank and we had this\nsoftware where the vendor specifically\n\n235\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.130\ntold us we will not support you if\nthe server is running a virtual machine.\n\n236\n00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:21.760\nYou get that.\n\n237\n00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.420\nSometimes the vendors they\njust don't wanna support that.\n\n238\n00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.280\nThey know it's easier for them from\na tech support stand point if their\n\n239\n00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.270\nsoftware is running on dedicated hardware.\n\n240\n00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.030\nIf you run it virtual, now,\nthey might have to troubleshoot the VM or\n\n241\n00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.290\nthe underlying OS and\nthey don't want to do that, right?\n\n242\n00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:38.580\nThe underlying virtualization platform.\n\n243\n00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.760\nSo, they'll just tell you hey we're not\ngonna support your virtual environment and\n\n244\n00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.410\nI hate it when I see that 'cuz it's\nreally no reason they can't do it and\n\n245\n00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.150\nmost vendors have gone better about\nit today 'cuz they know everybody's\n\n246\n00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.140\nvirtualizing stuff,\nit's the way of the future.\n\n247\n00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.390\nSo, when a vendor tells you they're not\ngonna support your virtual environment,\n\n248\n00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.860\nit usually means they're not\nmaintaining their product properly, and\n\n249\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.450\nit means it's probably\nnot a very good product.\n\n250\n00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.490\n>> Yeah.\nPitney Bowes ended up doing that with us.\n\n251\n00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.780\nAnd I stayed at the insurance company\nafter Don left to go to the bank.\n\n252\n00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.150\nAnd we did a lot of Pitney Bowes business.\n\n253\n00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.740\nAnd their software.\n\n254\n00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.350\nThey said, we will not support you\nif you virtualize these servers.\n\n255\n00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.850\nAnd it was a nightmare.\n\n256\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.625\nEverything about that\nsoftware was a nightmare.\n\n257\n00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:15.580\n[LAUGH] Upgrading it,\neverything you had to do with this,\n\n258\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.860\nso Don says it's probably not updated\nvery well or configured well, yeah.\n\n259\n00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:20.740\nI can attest to that.\n\n260\n00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.270\n>> Yeah.\n\n261\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.135\nSo what we would do is\nwe'd virtualize it anyway.\n\n262\n00:12:24.135 --> 00:12:27.630\n[LAUGH] And we'd say screw it, I'm going\nto put it in the VM but then if you\n\n263\n00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.200\never had a problem and you were gonna\ncall tech support you had to either hide\n\n264\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.070\nthe fact that it was in a VM or\nyou had to go V to P, virtual to physical.\n\n265\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.030\nAnd we would do that, we would do that\nwith some of our maintenance software and\n\n266\n00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.900\nso before you call tech support you say\nall right well let me migrate this thing,\n\n267\n00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.230\nand migrate it from the virtual\nenvironment back to a physical server,\n\n268\n00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.900\nrecreate the problem and make sure it\nwas still there because it would be, and\n\n269\n00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.510\nthen you'd call them on the phone and\nget support while it was physical,\n\n270\n00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.680\nthey'd fix the problem, and just\nmigrate it right back to virtual again.\n\n271\n00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.770\nIt was a pain in the butt,\nit took a lot of time, but\n\n272\n00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.700\nit let us have that server be virtual.\n\n273\n00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.060\nAnd we usually kept a couple of\nphysical servers around just for\n\n274\n00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.130\nthat purpose, cuz you never knew when it\nmight pop up that you might have some\n\n275\n00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.850\nkind of problem you're troubleshooting,\nand you're not sure.\n\n276\n00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.120\nIs it something wrong with the software or\n\n277\n00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.030\nis it something wrong with\nthe virtualization platform?\n\n278\n00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.290\nAnd by moving virtual to physical, you can\ntake the virtualization platform out of\n\n279\n00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.430\nthe picture, and now you can\nget an idea of what's going on.\n\n280\n00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.190\nSo three different forms\nof migration there, right?\n\n281\n00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.000\nP to V, physical to virtual,\nthat's the most common.\n\n282\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.420\nV to V, virtual to virtual,\nthat's a little less common but\n\n283\n00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.020\nstill used quite a bit.\n\n284\n00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.410\nAnd then lastly we've got that V to P,\nvirtual to physical,\n\n285\n00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:30.960\nthat's the least common of them.\n\n286\n00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.750\n>> Okay.\nWell now Don,\n\n287\n00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.340\nnow that we are moving this train along,\nwhat are some other considerations that we\n\n288\n00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.330\nmight need to, well, take into\nconsideration before we start migrating.\n\n289\n00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.850\n>> All right, I mentioned performance\nright, we know that our server when they\n\n290\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.980\nhave dedicated access to hardware,\nthey're gonna get pretty good performance,\n\n291\n00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.020\nthey're the one's accessing those\nhardware drives, that CPU or that RAM.\n\n292\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.040\nWhen we move them into\na virtual environment,\n\n293\n00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.460\nit's not exclusive access anymore, right.\n\n294\n00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.720\nSo, we might have shared\nresources on a server and so\n\n295\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.960\nif I have three virtual machines running\non the same physical hardware and they're\n\n296\n00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.790\nall trying to spike the CPU at the same\ntime, they're going to get limited access.\n\n297\n00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.030\nSo before I start virtualizing my servers,\nI need to do an inventory.\n\n298\n00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.270\nI need to do an inventory of all\nthe servers that I have, and\n\n299\n00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.020\na performance inventory of them.\n\n300\n00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.040\nI need to know what their average CPU is.\n\n301\n00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.540\nI need to know what their average RAM\nconsumption, their disk utilization.\n\n302\n00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.810\nI need to know all of that data so\n\n303\n00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:30.370\nthat when I move them over to virtual\nservers, I can balance them out.\n\n304\n00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.740\nI might have something like\nan active directory server.\n\n305\n00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.910\nThat's mostly CPU intensive.\n\n306\n00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.360\nAnd I might put that virtual machine on\na physical host right alongside a file\n\n307\n00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.210\nserver, knowing that file\nservers don't use a lot of CPU.\n\n308\n00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.257\nThey use a lot of disk IO.\n\n309\n00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:46.170\nRight, reading and writing from\nthe disk and network bandwidth.\n\n310\n00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.040\nSo I get disk and network on the file\nserver, CPU on the domain controller.\n\n311\n00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.600\nThey'll play along nicely on\nthe same physical host, right.\n\n312\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.750\nBut if I put a physical,\nI mean a file server, and\n\n313\n00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.460\na database server, on the same physical\nhost, they both generate a lot of disk IO.\n\n314\n00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.380\nAnd so now they're gonna be fighting\nagainst each other for disk IO.\n\n315\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.690\nAnd they wouldn't have had that on\ntheir own separate physical hardware.\n\n316\n00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:11.520\nBut when I put them on one physical server\nvirtualized, now they're butting heads.\n\n317\n00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.930\nSo we've gotta have a good understanding\nof the performance characteristics of our\n\n318\n00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.740\nsystems, and you know,\nthere's some neat software out there.\n\n319\n00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.480\nFor example, Microsoft.\n\n320\n00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.370\nIf you have the System Center Virtual\nMachine Manager, it's got this cool thing\n\n321\n00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.600\nwhere you can fire it up and\npoint it at your physical servers.\n\n322\n00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.630\nAnd you can tell it,\nhey monitor my servers for 24 hours.\n\n323\n00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.320\nAnd it will watch all of your servers for\n24 hours.\n\n324\n00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.860\nWhen it's done it will turn\nout this nice little report.\n\n325\n00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.870\nIt'll say here is the average\nutilization of each of your systems.\n\n326\n00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:41.820\nHere's CPU.\n\n327\n00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.060\nHere's network bandwidth and so on.\n\n328\n00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.510\nAnd then it will make recommendations.\n\n329\n00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.620\nIt'll say we recommend putting these\nfour servers together over here, and\n\n330\n00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.870\nthese eight servers together over here and\nit'll make recommendations on that.\n\n331\n00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.915\nAnd if you like it you click Do It.\n\n332\n00:15:53.915 --> 00:15:56.511\n[LAUGH] And it does it, it's crazy.\n\n333\n00:15:56.511 --> 00:15:59.170\nIt reaches out and it grabs the machines\nand converts them from physical\n\n334\n00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.840\ninto virtual, puts them in the right\nplace, and you're in business.\n\n335\n00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.572\nThat software's not inexpensive.\n\n336\n00:16:03.572 --> 00:16:05.055\nIt does cost a bit.\n\n337\n00:16:05.055 --> 00:16:08.400\nIt's actually not that bad, but\nit's worth it because of what it does.\n\n338\n00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.772\nThat is, making those intelligent\ndecisions, but if you're doing it by hand,\n\n339\n00:16:11.772 --> 00:16:15.358\nit's up to you, and be really careful,\ncuz some things are misleading, like disk.\n\n340\n00:16:15.358 --> 00:16:18.066\nA lot of people look at their servers,\nand they'll say, well,\n\n341\n00:16:18.066 --> 00:16:21.881\nthis server's using 64 gigs of storage,\nthis one's using 120 gigs of storage, and\n\n342\n00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:23.830\nthey'll balance based on that.\n\n343\n00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.915\nWell, let me tell you,\nthe storage size doesn't really matter.\n\n344\n00:16:25.915 --> 00:16:28.966\nI mean, yes, you need enough\nstorage space for that, great, but\n\n345\n00:16:28.966 --> 00:16:30.680\nit's really your disk IO.\n\n346\n00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.470\nHow many reads and\nwrites are you doing per second.\n\n347\n00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:38.100\nBecause if we've got two servers that\nare both writing constantly, well,\n\n348\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.830\nthey're gonna butt heads trying to write\nto the storage that you're virtualizing.\n\n349\n00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.450\nSo virtual storage is a much different\nperformance profile than physical storage.\n\n350\n00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.370\nPhysical storage you can get\nexclusive access to it, but\n\n351\n00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:52.250\nvirtual storage, it's shared disk IO and\nthat can really be, it almost always,\n\n352\n00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.430\nis the bottleneck for a server.\n\n353\n00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.560\nWhen a server is performing slowly,\nit almost always boils down to storage.\n\n354\n00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.740\nIt's not a guarantee, but\nit's an almost always.\n\n355\n00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.585\n>> All right, Don, so that takes us to can\nwe actually migrate to something please.\n\n356\n00:17:05.585 --> 00:17:08.505\n[LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely, now, the hard part here is,\n\n357\n00:17:08.505 --> 00:17:11.380\nyou know that CompTIA tries to\nremain vendor neutral on this stuff.\n\n358\n00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.580\nThey want you to understand that these\nconcepts are the same regardless of what\n\n359\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.590\nplatform that you work with, but\nwhen it comes to converting a physical\n\n360\n00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:22.580\nmachine to virtual, there's different ways\nto do it based on your software platform.\n\n361\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.820\nSo let's talk about some\nof the different ways.\n\n362\n00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.890\nLet's start with the hard way, the one\nthat's guaranteed to work everywhere.\n\n363\n00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.720\nThe guaranteed going to work everywhere\nway to take a physical server and\n\n364\n00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.710\nmigrate it to virtual is\nto not migrate at all.\n\n365\n00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.540\nThat's a stupid thing to say, but\nyou have your physical server,\n\n366\n00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.690\nlet's say it's an email server.\n\n367\n00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.050\nLet's say it is Microsoft Exchange.\n\n368\n00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.840\nSo it's running Windows Server 2012.\n\n369\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:47.250\nIt's got Exchange 2014 installed, and\nit's got some mailbox databases and\n\n370\n00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:52.020\nsome transport cues and all that good\nstuff right up there on that server, and\n\n371\n00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.180\nit's up and it's running and it's doing\nit's job, just great on a physical server.\n\n372\n00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:55.910\nI wanna virtualize it.\n\n373\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.780\nSo instead of doing some crazy migration,\nwhat I can do,\n\n374\n00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.580\nis I can go to my new system,\nmy new virtualization platform,\n\n375\n00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.950\nmaybe it's Hyper-V, maybe it's VMware,\nor ESX, or whatever.\n\n376\n00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.200\nAnd I create a virtual machine,\nand I set the hardware for\n\n377\n00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.000\nthat virtual machine to\nmatch the physical machine.\n\n378\n00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.770\nSo in my physical machine,\nmaybe I've got four cores of CPU and\n\n379\n00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.850\nI've got 32 gigs of RAM, so in my\nvirtual machine, I give it 4 cores and\n\n380\n00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.900\nI give it 32 gigs of RAM and\nI set up the virtual hard drives to match\n\n381\n00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.610\nthe physical hard drives and\nthen I make a choice.\n\n382\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.440\nI can take a backup of\nmy Exchange Server and\n\n383\n00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.710\nI can restore the backup\nin the virtual machine.\n\n384\n00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:37.666\nEffectively restoring that server a new\nhardware and getting it up and running.\n\n385\n00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:40.090\nThen, I just power off the old server,\nand that's it.\n\n386\n00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.470\nI just migrate it.\n\n387\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.620\nIt's not a true automated migration.\n\n388\n00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.780\nIt's really a backup and a restore.\n\n389\n00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.230\nI backed up my physical server.\n\n390\n00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.370\nI restored it into a VM with\na similar hardware configuration.\n\n391\n00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.567\nSo hard drive's the same size.\n\n392\n00:18:51.567 --> 00:18:53.526\nSame CPU quantity.\n\n393\n00:18:53.526 --> 00:18:55.580\nWe should be able to come up and\nbe running in no time.\n\n394\n00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.190\nThat's one way to do it.\n\n395\n00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.820\nAnother way to do it is,\ninstead of restoring a backup,\n\n396\n00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.730\nI've created a server with\nthe same hardware footprint.\n\n397\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:09.060\nI can install the operating system on it,\ninstall Microsoft Exchange on it, and\n\n398\n00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.260\nconfigure it as a second Exchange Server.\n\n399\n00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.889\nSo now I got two Exchange Servers,\nand inside of Microsoft Exchange,\n\n400\n00:19:14.889 --> 00:19:18.453\nI can migrate the mailboxes from\nthe old server to the new server, and\n\n401\n00:19:18.453 --> 00:19:22.451\nwhen all the mailboxes migrated over,\nmaybe I do this over a period of weeks or\n\n402\n00:19:22.451 --> 00:19:25.128\neven months,\nI migrate all those mailboxes over.\n\n403\n00:19:25.128 --> 00:19:27.233\nAnd then, when there's nobody\nleft on the original server,\n\n404\n00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:28.950\nI just get rid of the original server.\n\n405\n00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.310\nAnd now it's gone, I've got this\nnew server that's up and running.\n\n406\n00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.240\nThat's a very slow way to migrate in, and\n\n407\n00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.280\nthat's when I did the insurance\ncompany we're talking about.\n\n408\n00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.760\nThat's exactly what I did over there,\nis it took probably three months, for\n\n409\n00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.500\nme to get all the mailboxes migrated over.\n\n410\n00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.458\nWe had, I don't remember,\nwas it 110 branch offices?\n\n411\n00:19:45.458 --> 00:19:46.440\n>> Yes.\n>> It was a lot,\n\n412\n00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.904\nand I would do three branch offices a day.\n\n413\n00:19:48.904 --> 00:19:52.680\nAnd so, everyday, I'd grab the mailboxes\nfor three branch offices and move them\n\n414\n00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.126\nover to the virtual server, and then\nthe next day, I would do three more and\n\n415\n00:19:56.126 --> 00:19:59.736\nthe next day I would do three more, and\nthen eventually over, I think it was two\n\n416\n00:19:59.736 --> 00:20:03.155\nmonths, over two months everybody\nwas moved over to the new system.\n\n417\n00:20:03.155 --> 00:20:04.025\nWe just got rid of the old.\n\n418\n00:20:04.025 --> 00:20:05.615\nSo that's another way.\n\n419\n00:20:05.615 --> 00:20:09.265\nNeither of those methods leverage\nany special virtualization magic.\n\n420\n00:20:09.265 --> 00:20:11.735\nThey're actually the same tactics\nI would use to migrate over to new\n\n421\n00:20:11.735 --> 00:20:12.785\nphysical hardware.\n\n422\n00:20:12.785 --> 00:20:17.733\nSo if I had a physical server that was\njust old, and processor was worn out, or\n\n423\n00:20:17.733 --> 00:20:22.146\nnot worn out, but not as fast as it\nused to be, if I wanted to move to new\n\n424\n00:20:22.146 --> 00:20:26.208\nhardware, better hardware,\nI'd use these same processes.\n\n425\n00:20:26.208 --> 00:20:29.990\nIt's either backup and restore, or\nslowly migrate the services over.\n\n426\n00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:34.500\nSo that's not anything new and crazy,\nbut depending on the virtualization\n\n427\n00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.480\nplatform you use, they may well have\nsoftware that can help you with that.\n\n428\n00:20:39.502 --> 00:20:44.050\nAnd in Microsoft's Hyper-V, if you have\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager,\n\n429\n00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.830\nthat's the one I mentioned earlier,\nit's like magic.\n\n430\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.900\nIt will go out and\nprofile your environment,\n\n431\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.700\ntake an image of your machines,\nrestore them as virtual machines,\n\n432\n00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.930\npower off your original machine,\npower on the new VM, and you're done.\n\n433\n00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.830\nIt's really amazing what it does.\n\n434\n00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.141\n>> James Cameron calls it Skynet.\n\n435\n00:21:00.141 --> 00:21:02.678\n[LAUGH] We'll be fighting them soon.\n\n436\n00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:06.400\n>> Now, we just need some blue\nmonkeys in there and we'll have it.\n\n437\n00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.870\nSo it's a neat product.\n\n438\n00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.308\nIt really does some amazing things and\nyou can go that way.\n\n439\n00:21:10.308 --> 00:21:11.770\nThat's a heavy investment.\n\n440\n00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.340\nIt does break sometimes.\n\n441\n00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.120\nSometimes the migration fails,\nsomething goes wrong.\n\n442\n00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.700\nThere's some software that's not\ncompatible or something was going on with\n\n443\n00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.348\nthe systems during the migration,\nand that starts to break things.\n\n444\n00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:25.660\nNow, what do I mean by something\ngoing on during the migration?\n\n445\n00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.520\nWell, you can do online migrations and\noffline migrations.\n\n446\n00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.980\nAn online migration is where the machine\nis up and running right now, and\n\n447\n00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:38.650\nmy software goes in and takes an image\nof that system while it's online.\n\n448\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.868\nUsers could be in the system right now and\nwe can take an image of it.\n\n449\n00:21:41.868 --> 00:21:44.701\nAnd then, we restore that image\ninto a virtual machine, and\n\n450\n00:21:44.701 --> 00:21:46.380\nwe power off the original machine.\n\n451\n00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.510\nNow, the cool part about that\nis you have minimal downtime.\n\n452\n00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.400\nThe bad part about it is,\nyou take an image and\n\n453\n00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.490\nthen it has to restore the image and\npower off the original machine.\n\n454\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.580\nAny changes that happen\nafter that image was taken,\n\n455\n00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.290\nare gonna be lost when you\nmove over to the new machine.\n\n456\n00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:02.288\nSo you can lose some data.\n\n457\n00:22:02.288 --> 00:22:05.069\nIf you're doing this after hours or\nwhatever, it's not a big deal, but\n\n458\n00:22:05.069 --> 00:22:06.072\nif it's an email server,\n\n459\n00:22:06.072 --> 00:22:09.080\nyou might be getting emails after\nhours and you're gonna lose those.\n\n460\n00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.690\nSo online migrations like\nthat are a little bit risky.\n\n461\n00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.300\nOffline migrations are better.\n\n462\n00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.620\nYou shut the machine down and\nthen you take an image of it.\n\n463\n00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.173\nYou bring it into your virtualization\nsoftware and restore it, and\n\n464\n00:22:19.173 --> 00:22:21.248\nyour software platform may support that,\nit may not.\n\n465\n00:22:21.248 --> 00:22:23.548\nBut you've gotta be careful with that.\n\n466\n00:22:23.548 --> 00:22:27.568\nNow, I wanna show you\na utility that VMWare has\n\n467\n00:22:27.568 --> 00:22:31.598\nthat is called the VMware\nvCenter Converter.\n\n468\n00:22:31.598 --> 00:22:35.738\nIf you haven't worked with VMware before,\nthey have a central management software\n\n469\n00:22:35.738 --> 00:22:38.140\ncalled vCenter, and\nvCenter does everything.\n\n470\n00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.970\nIt manages your virtual servers,\n\n471\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.040\nit lets you deploy the virtual machines,\ncreate templates, it does everything and\n\n472\n00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.810\none piece of it is the vCenter Converter\nSoftware, what I'm looking at right here.\n\n473\n00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:55.868\nAnd what you can do,\nis you can create these jobs, tasks.\n\n474\n00:22:55.868 --> 00:22:58.625\nAnd you can say,\nI wanna virtualize this physical server,\n\n475\n00:22:58.625 --> 00:23:02.350\nand you can point the vCenter Converter\nat it and it'll do it for you.\n\n476\n00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.240\nAnd you can schedule it.\n\n477\n00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.380\nAnd so, what I'm looking at here is kinda\nmy blank screen, where I've got a task ID,\n\n478\n00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:10.900\na job ID, the source machine,\nthe destination machine,\n\n479\n00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.420\nwhat my status is,\nthe start time and the end time.\n\n480\n00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.580\nSo when is it gonna start,\ncuz I might schedule this for 1 AM.\n\n481\n00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:21.330\nThat way it happens after hours, and\nit'll go and it'll do all the work for me.\n\n482\n00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.340\nNow, what's the work that it's gonna do?\n\n483\n00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.310\nIt's gotta take an image of the machine,\nbut\n\n484\n00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:30.290\nbefore it does that, if this is\nphysical to virtual, there might be\n\n485\n00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:34.110\nphysical hardware drivers that\nare installed in that physical machine,\n\n486\n00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.505\nthat might not work in\na virtual environment.\n\n487\n00:23:35.505 --> 00:23:37.750\nThat might cause,\nWindows might blue screen on boot.\n\n488\n00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.170\nYou see this all the time.\n\n489\n00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.976\nWhere the physical server has\na raid controller driver or\n\n490\n00:23:41.976 --> 00:23:44.199\nsome kind of scuzzy\nsata controller driver,\n\n491\n00:23:44.199 --> 00:23:48.110\nthat when you virtualize that machine,\nit goes to boot and it blue screens.\n\n492\n00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.470\nYou just get a crash right there,\nthe machine doesn't even boot beyond that.\n\n493\n00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.526\nSo what this software is gonna do, is\nit's gonna reach out and it's gonna build\n\n494\n00:23:55.526 --> 00:23:59.411\nthe image and it's gonna disable those\ndrivers, disable the bad drivers.\n\n495\n00:23:59.411 --> 00:24:02.280\nAnd remember, I talked about\nthe virtual machine guest tools,\n\n496\n00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.173\nthe additions that we might install, the\ndrivers for your virtualization platform?\n\n497\n00:24:06.173 --> 00:24:07.549\nIt'll install those too.\n\n498\n00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:11.160\nWhen it's disabling the other drivers,\nit puts its drivers in place,\n\n499\n00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.432\nso that when your system boots up, it'll\nrecognize all the new virtual hardware and\n\n500\n00:24:15.432 --> 00:24:19.330\nthe ins and outs of being on a hypervisor,\nand it'll run fine.\n\n501\n00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.650\nOn Linux, it's not such a big deal.\n\n502\n00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.100\nOn Windows, it is a really big deal.\n\n503\n00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.340\nWhen your processor architecture changes,\nor when your storage controller changes,\n\n504\n00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.450\nWindows is really bad about blue\nscreening, or just booting up and\n\n505\n00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.295\nsaying no operating system found, right?\n\n506\n00:24:33.295 --> 00:24:34.980\nThis software will take care of that.\n\n507\n00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.962\nIt fixes that so that your operating\nsystem is ready to receive the virtual\n\n508\n00:24:37.962 --> 00:24:40.573\nenvironment and it boots up\nthe first time and your in business.\n\n509\n00:24:40.573 --> 00:24:42.970\nAnd if there's a failure it tells you why,\nright?\n\n510\n00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:45.260\nAnd let me show you the way\nthis software kind of works.\n\n511\n00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.045\nYou come in here and you tell it\nthat you want to convert a machine.\n\n512\n00:24:49.045 --> 00:24:51.100\nSo I'm just gonna hit that\nConvert machine button up there.\n\n513\n00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.950\nAnd it's gonna launch a wizard.\n\n514\n00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.646\nAnd the wizard's just gonna ask us a few\nbasic questions about the machine that we\n\n515\n00:24:56.646 --> 00:24:57.780\nwant to convert.\n\n516\n00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.250\nSo first it's asking me what I wanna do.\n\n517\n00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:04.650\nDo I wanna take and convert a machine\nthat's powered on or powered off?\n\n518\n00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:07.190\nIf it's an online migration,\nI leave it powered on and\n\n519\n00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:08.380\nI'm gonna go that way, right?\n\n520\n00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.720\nBut if it's powered off I'm gonna\nneed some kind of CD, DVD or\n\n521\n00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.154\nUSB key that I can boot off\nof to create the image.\n\n522\n00:25:16.154 --> 00:25:18.687\nCuz I can't take an image of machine\nthat's not even turned on, right?\n\n523\n00:25:18.687 --> 00:25:22.878\nSo, if I choose that route,\nit's gonna walk me through the process of\n\n524\n00:25:22.878 --> 00:25:26.590\ncreating that boot disk to go in and\nfire up the machine.\n\n525\n00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.980\nBut in my case,\nI want one that's powered on.\n\n526\n00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.790\nAnd I can pick if it's\na remote Windows machine or\n\n527\n00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:36.170\na remote Linux machine, or\nif it's the machine that I'm currently on.\n\n528\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.270\nRight, I'm on a Windows 7 machine, I don't\nwanna back that up, I've got a server.\n\n529\n00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:42.130\nSo let me find my server,\nwhere is that thing?\n\n530\n00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.960\nI'm remoted into it, here we go,\nso, that's different.\n\n531\n00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.576\nSo I'm remoted into\na small server apparently.\n\n532\n00:25:48.576 --> 00:25:49.134\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n533\n00:25:49.134 --> 00:25:53.540\n[LAUGH] so this is a Windows Server 2012\nmachine that is a web server, right?\n\n534\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.920\nSo if I were to fire up a web browser and\nbrowse to its own page,\n\n535\n00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.250\nwhich I apparently can't do,\nthen I would see the IIS welcome page.\n\n536\n00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:02.840\nThere we go.\n\n537\n00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.290\nSo it's just a web server, and\nit's up, and it's running, and\n\n538\n00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:06.600\nit's happy, all right?\n\n539\n00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.444\nSo if I wanna convert that machine,\nI can come in here, and\n\n540\n00:26:09.444 --> 00:26:11.833\nI can specify its DNS host name or\nits IP address.\n\n541\n00:26:11.833 --> 00:26:15.216\nWhich I don't know so I'm gonna go\nover here to my tiny server and\n\n542\n00:26:15.216 --> 00:26:17.106\nfind out its IP address real quick.\n\n543\n00:26:17.106 --> 00:26:23.544\nAnd I can see that it is 10.1.230.73,\nso when I jump back over to the wizard,\n\n544\n00:26:23.544 --> 00:26:27.548\n10.1.230.73, I'll just punch that in.\n\n545\n00:26:27.548 --> 00:26:30.382\nAnd it's gonna need a user name and\na password, right?\n\n546\n00:26:30.382 --> 00:26:32.344\nCuz it's gotta be able to\nlogin to the machine, so\n\n547\n00:26:32.344 --> 00:26:34.320\nI'm gonna login with\nan administrator account.\n\n548\n00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.650\nAlways a good idea when\nyou're imaging a machine.\n\n549\n00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.346\nAnd I'm just gonna validate that.\n\n550\n00:26:40.346 --> 00:26:43.450\nYou validate it, that means it reaches\nout and tries to connect to it and\n\n551\n00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.810\nmake sure that it is\nable to see the machine.\n\n552\n00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:49.390\nAnd so here's it's tell me VMware vCenter\nConverter Standalone agent needs to be\n\n553\n00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.120\ntemporarily installed\non the source machine.\n\n554\n00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:56.890\nIt's gotta install itself over there so\nit can take the image of the machine.\n\n555\n00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.650\nAnd then it can automatically\nuninstall when the import is done.\n\n556\n00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.810\nI don't need it there anymore\nif I've imported the machine,\n\n557\n00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.740\nI can delete the tools or\nwe can leave it there for later.\n\n558\n00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.880\nAll right,\nI'll just leave it as automatic, okay.\n\n559\n00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.810\nSo now it's gonna reach out and\n\n560\n00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.700\nit's gonna deploy that agent,\nassuming I typed the password right.\n\n561\n00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.710\nI could've typed the password wrong and\nthis'll fail.\n\n562\n00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.290\nSo it's gonna install itself\non that other machine.\n\n563\n00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.350\nAnd once it's done,\nit can now talk to that machine and\n\n564\n00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.050\nwe can tell it to take an image.\n\n565\n00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.370\nNow on a Linux box, it may reboot, and\n\n566\n00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.730\nboot into its own software to\nbe able to take the image.\n\n567\n00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:28.190\nOn a Windows machine,\nit'll use Volume Shadow Copy,\n\n568\n00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.960\nthe Volume Shadow Copy Service\nthat runs in the background.\n\n569\n00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.940\nAnd, it's telling me that another version\nof this product is already installed, so\n\n570\n00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.440\nI may have installed it on there before.\n\n571\n00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.565\nHm, interesting, so yeah, seems to think\nit's already there, so that's okay.\n\n572\n00:27:42.565 --> 00:27:45.340\nSo if it's already there,\nthen I don't need to validate.\n\n573\n00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.490\nI should be good to go and\nI'll just hit Next.\n\n574\n00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.278\nAnd it's gonna move forward and\nstart to reach out to it.\n\n575\n00:27:49.278 --> 00:27:51.910\nSo, it's still gonna try and deploy to it.\n\n576\n00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:53.210\nSo I need to double check and\n\n577\n00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.780\nmake sure I haven't installed that\nsoftware on that machine before.\n\n578\n00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.300\nSo if I take a look at it,\nand this is really annoying,\n\n579\n00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.940\nlet me disconnect from this real quick and\nreconnect so it goes full screen.\n\n580\n00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.640\nThat's a good old Remote Desktop for\nyou right there.\n\n581\n00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.620\nAll right, so I'm just gonna\nremote back into that one and\n\n582\n00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.860\nI'm gonna see if I do have\nthat agent installed.\n\n583\n00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:17.259\nI might, in which case I just need\nto uninstall it real quick and\n\n584\n00:28:17.259 --> 00:28:18.423\nwe can fix that.\n\n585\n00:28:18.423 --> 00:28:21.447\nAnd sure enough, I have the vCenter\nConverter install on that machine so\n\n586\n00:28:21.447 --> 00:28:22.745\nI'm just going to uninstall.\n\n587\n00:28:22.745 --> 00:28:23.625\nActually, you know what,\n\n588\n00:28:23.625 --> 00:28:26.070\nI could just run it from that\nmachine if it's installed here.\n\n589\n00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:29.430\nThat would save me a little bit of time,\nso I'll just run it from right here.\n\n590\n00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:33.200\nAnd I'm gonna have the machine\nconvert itself, that's always fun.\n\n591\n00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.122\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm just\ngonna take this software, and\n\n592\n00:28:37.122 --> 00:28:41.131\nI'll go to convert the machine,\nand here's that same wizard.\n\n593\n00:28:41.131 --> 00:28:44.600\nExcept instead of telling it a remote\nmachine, I'm gonna say this local machine.\n\n594\n00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.630\nI wanna image this machine.\n\n595\n00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.766\nOkay, and then when I go forward it's\ngoing to ask the important question,\n\n596\n00:28:49.766 --> 00:28:50.996\nwhere am I gonna send this to?\n\n597\n00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:54.925\nAnd what we normally wanna do is we\nnormally wanna send it to our VMware\n\n598\n00:28:54.925 --> 00:28:58.810\nserver, in this case\nthe VMware Infrastructure virtual machine.\n\n599\n00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.116\nWe're gonna send it over\nto our vSphere install and\n\n600\n00:29:01.116 --> 00:29:03.170\nget it running on a machine over there.\n\n601\n00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.820\nBut you'll see where I can\npick VMware Workstation also.\n\n602\n00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.690\nSo if I had VMware Workstation or\nsomething like that, I could choose it.\n\n603\n00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.740\nAnd when you go that route, see I've\ngot VMware Fusion on my laptop, so\n\n604\n00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.660\nI could send this over to\nVMware Fusion if I wanted.\n\n605\n00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.780\nAnd I would just need to give\nit a virtual machine name and\n\n606\n00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:17.920\nwhere I want to store that.\n\n607\n00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.300\nAnd I'd probably pick a network\nlocation here to send it.\n\n608\n00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.405\nIf you choose to send it to\nVMware Infrastructure though,\n\n609\n00:29:23.405 --> 00:29:27.290\nit'll send to a live server and\nbring it online.\n\n610\n00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:31.800\nAnd when you finish this wizard up, it's\ngonna go ahead and image this machine,\n\n611\n00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.900\nsend the copy to where we need it,\nand then we're ready.\n\n612\n00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.060\nWe're migrated, we're virtual, and it's\nready to come up, and we're in business.\n\n613\n00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.490\nSo pretty straightforward\nprocess with software like this.\n\n614\n00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:47.000\nThis software works with a controlling\nserver, which is the vCenter Converter,\n\n615\n00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.040\nand it works with agents that it\npushes out on the individual machines.\n\n616\n00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.270\nSome software doesn't do it this way.\n\n617\n00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.959\nSome software doesn't have that\ncentral agent like what we were seeing\n\n618\n00:29:55.959 --> 00:29:56.710\nhere on mine.\n\n619\n00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:00.550\nWhoops, I'm gonna get motion sickness,\nthere we go.\n\n620\n00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.110\nSo some of it doesn't work with\nthe central controller like this.\n\n621\n00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.670\nCentral controllers are really nice\nif you're gonna be migrating a lot\n\n622\n00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:06.190\nof machines.\n\n623\n00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:10.920\nMaybe you're gonna migrate 80 physical\nmachines to virtual machines.\n\n624\n00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.010\nYou can control all those jobs right here,\nall at the same time, they can be up and\n\n625\n00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:18.090\nrunning and\nreally get some work done, right?\n\n626\n00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.751\nBut if it's just a one-off conversion,\n\n627\n00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:22.897\nyou're probably not gonna wanna bring\nup something like vCenter Converter.\n\n628\n00:30:22.897 --> 00:30:26.182\nYou're probably just gonna use some of the\nother built in tools that they have for\n\n629\n00:30:26.182 --> 00:30:27.737\nmigration, for one-offs, right?\n\n630\n00:30:27.737 --> 00:30:32.770\nAnd VMware Fusion is\na great example of that.\n\n631\n00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.750\nIf I go over to VMware Fusion,\n\n632\n00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:38.590\nhere's the virtual machines that I've got\nthat I've kinda created on here over time.\n\n633\n00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:42.054\nBut if I go up here to Add,\nI can add a new machine, or\n\n634\n00:30:42.054 --> 00:30:47.632\nI can import a machine that's already\nan image, or I can Migrate Your PC, right?\n\n635\n00:30:47.632 --> 00:30:49.693\nAnd if I choose that Migrate Your PC,\n\n636\n00:30:49.693 --> 00:30:53.430\nit takes me into a wizard similar\nto what we saw with the converter.\n\n637\n00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:58.260\nAnd as we walk through this, you'll see\nthat it's offering to do the migration\n\n638\n00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.250\nright over the network, to take that\nmachine and bring it into VMware Fusion.\n\n639\n00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:07.095\nAnd as I continue forward, you'll see that\nit's giving me a URL right here, right?\n\n640\n00:31:07.095 --> 00:31:11.578\nIt wants me to go to\nvmware.com/go/pc2mac2015.\n\n641\n00:31:11.578 --> 00:31:15.320\nIt wants me to go to this URL and\ninstall the agent myself.\n\n642\n00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.070\nI'm gonna manually install the agent.\n\n643\n00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:20.340\nThis is why it's not good\nif I'm doing 80 machines.\n\n644\n00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.580\nI don't want it to go to all 80\nof them and install an agent.\n\n645\n00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.310\nWith a vCenter Converter you saw\nwhere it would push the agent out for\n\n646\n00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.730\nme, this won't.\n\n647\n00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.273\nSo I need to go to the machine and\ninstall that agent.\n\n648\n00:31:28.273 --> 00:31:31.360\nAnd once that happens,\nit'll find it on the network, and\n\n649\n00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.940\nit'll take care of the rest.\n\n650\n00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:36.400\nAnd so\nnow I can jump over to that server, or\n\n651\n00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.380\nI could even do like this Windows\n7 machine here if I wanted.\n\n652\n00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.790\nLet's do this server,\nwhere did I park that server?\n\n653\n00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.420\nHere, actually I was on it a second ago.\n\n654\n00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.280\nLet me get out of all this mess.\n\n655\n00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:50.510\nAnd I can fire up a web browser,\nwhoops, and I can install that agent.\n\n656\n00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:53.734\nSo I'm gonna fire up a web browser, and\n\n657\n00:31:53.734 --> 00:31:58.740\nI will browse to the URL that\nthey gave me, which I just lost.\n\n658\n00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:03.193\n[LAUGH] Sometimes I hit Copy by accident\nthen you lose what's in your clipboard.\n\n659\n00:32:03.193 --> 00:32:06.721\nSo let's try that again.\n\n660\n00:32:06.721 --> 00:32:07.722\nGreat.\n\n661\n00:32:07.722 --> 00:32:09.835\nOr I'm just losing control\nof virtual machine.\n\n662\n00:32:09.835 --> 00:32:11.218\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's saying look,\n\n663\n00:32:11.218 --> 00:32:12.403\nyou're not the boss of me.\n\n664\n00:32:12.403 --> 00:32:13.238\nThere we go.\n\n665\n00:32:13.238 --> 00:32:15.780\nAll right so,\nI'm gonna browse to that web page, and\n\n666\n00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.062\nthe web page is pretty straight forward.\n\n667\n00:32:18.062 --> 00:32:23.220\nApparently I need to allow that, so let\nme add it to my safe internet settings.\n\n668\n00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.320\nSee, these are all the problems that the\nV-Center Converter saves us from, right,\n\n669\n00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.740\ncuz it pushes the agent.\n\n670\n00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.932\nBut here I've got to go and download this\non my server, and it'd probably be easier\n\n671\n00:32:30.932 --> 00:32:33.180\njust to download it on my own client and\nupload it that way.\n\n672\n00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:40.120\nBut I'll add VMware, just gonna add\nstar.vmware.com to my trusted list.\n\n673\n00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.385\nProbably a little heavy handed here.\n\n674\n00:32:42.385 --> 00:32:47.469\nI could figure out what the actual URL is,\nbut we'll do it this way and there we go.\n\n675\n00:32:47.469 --> 00:32:51.860\nSo now I'm gonna save that file and we'll\nrun it and it's gonna install the agent.\n\n676\n00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.620\nAs soon as the agent is up and running,\nVMware Fusion will be able to see it.\n\n677\n00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.220\nAnd that's when it's gonna\ndo the rest of it, right.\n\n678\n00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.740\nIt's gonna check for any virtualization\nagents that are already installed, and\n\n679\n00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.630\nremove them.\n\n680\n00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.890\nIt's gonna make sure we've got all\nthe drivers for VMware installed.\n\n681\n00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:08.790\nAnd then it's gonna take an image of this\nmachine, and drag it into VMware Fusion,\n\n682\n00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:09.990\nand bring it online.\n\n683\n00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:13.010\nNow the key things to remember about this.\n\n684\n00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:16.633\nFirst off, it takes a long time,\nall right.\n\n685\n00:33:16.633 --> 00:33:19.329\nDepending on the size of your\nvirtual machine, you'll be lucky,\n\n686\n00:33:19.329 --> 00:33:22.270\neven on a small machine, for\nif it to take less than an hour.\n\n687\n00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:26.182\nBut on a big machine, on an email server\nthat might have terabytes of data,\n\n688\n00:33:26.182 --> 00:33:28.930\nthis could take eight,\ntwelve hours in some cases.\n\n689\n00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:33.080\nIt can take a long time, so you definitely\nwanna schedule this for after hours.\n\n690\n00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:33.690\nAll right.\n\n691\n00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:34.391\n>> Where's the fun in that.\n\n692\n00:33:34.391 --> 00:33:35.580\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, well,\n\n693\n00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.510\nyou could just tell your users,\nhey, no email today.\n\n694\n00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.260\nJust let me know.\n\n695\n00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.650\nSo definitely plan on\nit taking a long time.\n\n696\n00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:44.600\nAnd then the second thing\nis don't assume it worked.\n\n697\n00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.990\nJust because the virtual\nmachine is now created and\n\n698\n00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.300\nrunning, doesn't mean your\nsoftware still works.\n\n699\n00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.760\nSo, you need to get in there and\ncheck your software and\n\n700\n00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.690\nmake sure it still functions.\n\n701\n00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.430\nIf it's an email server,\nare you receiving email?\n\n702\n00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:58.340\nCan you fire up a mail client\nconnect to get to your inbox, right?\n\n703\n00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.550\nIs that stuff working?\n\n704\n00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.980\nIf it's a file server,\ncan you browse in and access your files?\n\n705\n00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.680\nDid the permissions stay?\n\n706\n00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.380\nAre all the things that were\nprotected before still protected?\n\n707\n00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:10.860\nYou've got to check and make sure that\nall of that stuff is still there and\n\n708\n00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:15.430\nfunctional and that things are working\nthe way that they're intended to work.\n\n709\n00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:18.180\nIf they aren't, then you need to\ngo back to your physical server,\n\n710\n00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.950\nwhich fortunately your physical server\nshould just be shut down now, so\n\n711\n00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:25.110\nyou just delete the VM and power up the\nphysical server and you're in business.\n\n712\n00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:30.510\nShoot, the vCenter converter is installed\non here so it's getting upset about that.\n\n713\n00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:33.158\nSo I really need to uninstall\nthat converter to do it.\n\n714\n00:34:33.158 --> 00:34:36.790\nBut once the agent's installed,\nwe can reach out and see that,\n\n715\n00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:40.297\nand back here it'll find it and\nit'll start that migration.\n\n716\n00:34:40.297 --> 00:34:43.299\nAnd like I said, we have to sit here for\na couple of hours, usually,\n\n717\n00:34:43.299 --> 00:34:46.829\nwhile it takes that image and brings it in\nhere, but at the end of the day you end up\n\n718\n00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:51.090\nwith a virtual machine that has the same\nhardware profile as the physical machine.\n\n719\n00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.570\nIt restores that system into and it comes\nonline, should have the same IP address,\n\n720\n00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:58.420\nshould have the same Mac address,\nshould have the same configuration, and\n\n721\n00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.180\noff it goes.\n\n722\n00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:03.680\nNow, one of the considerations I want to\nthrow in before we wrap the episode up,\n\n723\n00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.780\nis if you're running Microsoft Windows,\nit will have to reactivate.\n\n724\n00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.530\nAnd so you have a license key in Windows\nthat you activate when you first\n\n725\n00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:10.310\ninstall it.\n\n726\n00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.410\nWhen it becomes virtual, it's gonna see\nthat as new hardware or a new install, so\n\n727\n00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:14.470\nyou'll have to reactivate.\n\n728\n00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.550\nSo be aware of that on the licensing side.\n\n729\n00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:18.340\nIf it's Linux, it's not a big deal.\n\n730\n00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.930\nBut if it's Windows, you've always\ngot that licensing to worry about.\n\n731\n00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:23.300\n>> Well,\nthis has been excellent stuff, Don.\n\n732\n00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.209\nWe've taken a look at all the reasons\nwhy we would wanna migrate.\n\n733\n00:35:26.209 --> 00:35:30.368\nSome of the considerations we would need\nto take in account before we even start\n\n734\n00:35:30.368 --> 00:35:31.132\na migration.\n\n735\n00:35:31.132 --> 00:35:34.170\nAnd now we've actually even looked at how\nsome of the ways we can go through and\n\n736\n00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.507\nactually do a migration, and\nnow Don's at the part where,\n\n737\n00:35:36.507 --> 00:35:39.200\nreally, we would just wait for it,\nand we might be that committed.\n\n738\n00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.510\nEverybody ready for an hour show?\n\n739\n00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:43.070\nNo. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH]\n>> But you just wait until it's done,\n\n740\n00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:46.500\nand then once it says, hey,\nhere's your virtual machine, you press go,\n\n741\n00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.130\nyou press start, you press play,\nwhatever the option is they give you, and\n\n742\n00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:50.230\nthere is your machine.\n\n743\n00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:53.470\nLike Don says, make sure that everything\nis working before you say, hey,\n\n744\n00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:55.880\nthat production server is back up and\nready to rock.\n\n745\n00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.920\nYou wanna verify that before you\ntell anyone to start using it again.\n\n746\n00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.750\nAnd in case something happens you got the\nold guy still sitting there waiting for\n\n747\n00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.440\nyou so that you can restore to that.\n\n748\n00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.640\nDon, anything else we need to cover\nbefore we close this episode?\n\n749\n00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.220\n>> That's all about it,\nthat's all I've got.\n\n750\n00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.810\n>> All right, well thank you so\nmuch for explaining this to us.\n\n751\n00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:11.930\nI'm sure our viewers appreciate it.\n\n752\n00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:12.780\nI know I did.\n\n753\n00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.330\nEven though I've dealt with this before,\n\n754\n00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:18.260\nit's always good to refresh and\nto reassess this kind of things.\n\n755\n00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.470\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n756\n00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.160\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n757\n00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.000\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n758\n00:36:23.000 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.689\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode well we're moving\n\n4\n00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.310\nforward with our Cloud Plus series for\nCompTIA.\n\n5\n00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.900\nHopefully you've been enjoying it so\nfar because joining us again in the studio\n\n6\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.405\nagain today, well, it's none other\nthan our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.320\nDon welcome back to the show and\nhow are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.580\n>> I am doing great Daniel,\n\n9\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.650\nready to jump right back into\nthe world of virtualization.\n\n10\n00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.260\nAnd in this episode we're gonna talk about\na neat feature that has saved my bacon\n\n11\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.670\nmore than once and that is,\nsnapshots of virtual machines.\n\n12\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.990\nWe'll talk a little bit about backup and\nrestore also, but\n\n13\n00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.900\nsnapshots are just a great way to\nprotect ourselves from bad changes or\n\n14\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.790\nthings that would normally\nbring a physical machine down.\n\n15\n00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.660\nBut allow us to quickly\nrecover a virtual machine and\n\n16\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.440\nhave it back online in a matter of seconds\nand really achieve some cool stuff.\n\n17\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.160\nSo that's what we're going to be\ntaking a look at in this episode.\n\n18\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.820\n>> That's right, the snapshot in\nthe VM environment is a god send.\n\n19\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.270\nIt is probably in my opinion\none of the best features\n\n20\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.820\nthat they offer in virtualization because\nlike Don has said it saved his bacon,\n\n21\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.650\nit saved my bacon plenty of times.\n\n22\n00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.600\nIt's really protecting us from\nourselves to be honest with you.\n\n23\n00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.980\nYou make a bad change, you install\na patch and things don't go right.\n\n24\n00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.840\nThe server is not working correctly.\n\n25\n00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.740\nWhat do we do?\n\n26\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.450\nWell I could go on and try and\nuninstall or maybe go from backup.\n\n27\n00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.820\nBut if I've made a snapshot,\nmy life just got a whole lot easier.\n\n28\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.840\nSo Don, explain to us, what is a snapshot?\n\n29\n00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.415\nHow can we use this miracle of modern man?\n\n30\n00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:41.714\n[LAUGH]\n>> I love your example of updates cuz\n\n31\n00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:46.321\nthat's really where it's helped me a lot,\nand if you've worked with Windows for\n\n32\n00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:49.614\na long time,\nI really cut my teeth with Windows NT 4.0.\n\n33\n00:01:49.614 --> 00:01:53.065\nAnd in Windows NT 4,\nwhen a new service pack came out, and\n\n34\n00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:54.620\nthey use to come out a lot.\n\n35\n00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.840\nAnd even now, your lucky to get\ntwo service packs on an OS.\n\n36\n00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.750\nBut back then, you'd get six.\n\n37\n00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.220\nAnd, when an update pack would come out,\nyou'd take your server,\n\n38\n00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.090\nyou'd install the update.\n\n39\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.940\nAnd then it would reboot.\n\n40\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.050\nAnd that reboot was always this like\nnail-biting moment because your odds of\n\n41\n00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.940\nhaving a blue screen on\nboot were pretty high.\n\n42\n00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.040\nAnd if you did, if it blue screened on\nboot, what you had to do was hope you had\n\n43\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.820\ntaken a backup of that server cause you\nwere about to have to restore it right?\n\n44\n00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.440\nThere was no way to uninstall that\nservice pack, you were just screwed.\n\n45\n00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.130\nAnd even when you had a way to\nuninstall the service pack,\n\n46\n00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.000\nsometimes if it was blue screening on\nboot, you couldn't even get past that.\n\n47\n00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.510\nSo you had to format the machine,\nrestore from backup, and\n\n48\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.430\nit was gonna be a couple hours to do it.\n\n49\n00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.410\nSo updates like that were always, really,\nreally tenuous, you just didn't know what\n\n50\n00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.910\nwas gonna happen, you had to test\nthem out in a test environment.\n\n51\n00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.870\nBut no matter how well you would test it,\nthere was always that moment of\n\n52\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.470\ntrepidation when you applied\nan update to a production machine.\n\n53\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.380\nIn the virtual world,\nit's really all still the same, right?\n\n54\n00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.680\nYou still have the same operating systems\nthat are running in the virtual machines,\n\n55\n00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.590\nexcept we can use snapshots to protect us.\n\n56\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.900\nWhat a snapshot does is it takes,\nlike a picture,\n\n57\n00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.380\nit takes an image of your machine\nas it is right at that moment.\n\n58\n00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.440\nIt freezes it in time and\n\n59\n00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.500\nthen from that point on every change\nyou make is written separately.\n\n60\n00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.605\nIt writes those changes to\na separate set of files.\n\n61\n00:03:10.605 --> 00:03:14.380\nAnd if something goes wrong you can just\ndelete those separate set of files and\n\n62\n00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.655\nit puts you right back\nto the way things were.\n\n63\n00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:19.950\nAnd so you can quickly and\neasily recover from what you did.\n\n64\n00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.400\nNow, there's positives and\nnegatives to snapshots.\n\n65\n00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.618\nSo, they sound great, they're awesome,\nthey're easy to use, but\n\n66\n00:03:25.618 --> 00:03:28.520\nthey're not the be all end all\nof solutions that are out there.\n\n67\n00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.960\nAnd I'll talk about that\nas the episode goes on,\n\n68\n00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.220\nsome of the different things\nwe have to watch out for.\n\n69\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.765\nBut I've kind of explained it, but\nit's hard to grasp that right.\n\n70\n00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:38.875\nSo I want to show you guys\nthis kind of thing in action.\n\n71\n00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:40.795\nHow these snapshots work.\n\n72\n00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:43.465\nThe first thing I wanna show you is,\nsnapshots can be a little different\n\n73\n00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:46.765\ndepending on whether the machine is on or\nif the machine is off.\n\n74\n00:03:46.765 --> 00:03:50.905\nIf the machine is off,\na snapshot is really, really quite simple.\n\n75\n00:03:50.905 --> 00:03:51.855\nLet me show you here.\n\n76\n00:03:51.855 --> 00:03:52.625\nI'll take this machine.\n\n77\n00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:55.785\nSo here's a Windows 7 machine that's\nup and running on VMware Fusion.\n\n78\n00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:57.060\nI'm just gonna shut it down.\n\n79\n00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.710\nAnd we'll turn it off all right.\n\n80\n00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.240\nWhen a machine is off if I\nwanna take a snapshot of it\n\n81\n00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.410\nthere's really only two pieces of\ninformation that I need to snapshot.\n\n82\n00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.230\nThere's my hardware configuration and\nthere's the hard drive, right?\n\n83\n00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.460\nIf I come in here and take that\nmachine and I'm just gonna go and\n\n84\n00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.500\ntake a look at it's files.\n\n85\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.980\nThe files that are actually\na part of that machine.\n\n86\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.226\nAll right, so\nlooking inside of that virtual machine,\n\n87\n00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:23.239\nI can start to see\nthe files that make it up.\n\n88\n00:04:23.239 --> 00:04:24.238\nAnd so here's the disk, right.\n\n89\n00:04:24.238 --> 00:04:28.525\nSo I've got Virtual Disk-cl3-s001 and\nso on.\n\n90\n00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:32.510\nVMWare Fusion likes to break up\nyour disks into four gig files,\n\n91\n00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.050\nso that when you copy to other files\nsystems they'll actually survive the copy.\n\n92\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.540\nSo this is my virtual hard drive and you\ncan see I've got files 1 through 16 and\n\n93\n00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.830\nthen the base file of the hard\ndrive itself right there,\n\n94\n00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.840\nwhich is actually only 1 K in size,\nvery small.\n\n95\n00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.010\nAll right so\nthose are the files that I've got for it.\n\n96\n00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.450\nAnd then as I look down\nI've got an nvram file\n\n97\n00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.940\nwhich is where the fake BIOS\nis storing its configuration.\n\n98\n00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.160\nI've got a vmx file,\nthat's the configuration for\n\n99\n00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.620\nmy virtual machine right.\n\n100\n00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.790\nSo do I have four gigs of ram or\ntwo gigs of ram?\n\n101\n00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.230\nDo I have two cores of CPU or one core?\n\n102\n00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.620\nThat's stored in the vmx file.\n\n103\n00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.890\nAnd then I've got a lock file for\nwhen it's running, and\n\n104\n00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.910\na few of the little files for\nconfiguration.\n\n105\n00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.250\nBut when a machine is turned off, this vmx\nfile, that's my hardware configuration.\n\n106\n00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.880\nAnd these vmdks,\nthat's my virtual machine disk, right?\n\n107\n00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.211\nSo if I take a snapshot of this machine\nright now, it's gonna freeze the disk and\n\n108\n00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:29.752\nit's gonna freeze the configuration as\nthey are right at this very moment, okay.\n\n109\n00:05:29.752 --> 00:05:32.983\nSo I'm gonna go back here and\nI'm gonna take my virtual machine,\n\n110\n00:05:32.983 --> 00:05:34.231\nthis WIN-CLIENT01.\n\n111\n00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:36.715\nAnd I'm gonna right-click on it and\ngo to Snapshots.\n\n112\n00:05:36.715 --> 00:05:41.138\nAnd I'm gonna see all the snapshots\nthat I have right now, which are none.\n\n113\n00:05:41.138 --> 00:05:42.700\nI don't have a single snapshot.\n\n114\n00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.720\nAll I have is the Current State.\n\n115\n00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.960\nThis is how the machine is right now,\nat this very moment, okay.\n\n116\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.020\nIf I turn it on, that changes, right?\n\n117\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.330\nNow it's how it is at that moment.\n\n118\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.520\nSo this is constantly changing.\n\n119\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.410\nCurrent state is constantly changing.\n\n120\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.046\nBut I can go up here and I can hit\nTake and I'm gonna take a snapshot.\n\n121\n00:05:58.046 --> 00:06:04.977\nAnd so\nmaybe I call this Prior to Installing SP1.\n\n122\n00:06:04.977 --> 00:06:06.580\nSo I'm not seeing installed service pack.\n\n123\n00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.710\nAnd so I'm gonna take a snapshot\nof this thing right now.\n\n124\n00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.020\nAnd so now I've got two.\n\n125\n00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.300\nI've got prior to installing\nthe service pack, and\n\n126\n00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.080\nI've got the current state, right.\n\n127\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.260\nHow the machine is, right now.\n\n128\n00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.100\nNow let's go back and take a look at\nthose files and see what's changed.\n\n129\n00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.680\nSo if I go back to my files,\n\n130\n00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.250\nwhat I should see is things\nare a little bit different now, okay.\n\n131\n00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.264\nRemember how I had my\nvirtual disk earlier and\n\n132\n00:06:31.264 --> 00:06:35.320\n-s001 all the way through 16.vmdk.\n\n133\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.030\nBut now, I've got some extra\nnumbers thrown in there.\n\n134\n00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.105\nAll those files changed the name.\n\n135\n00:06:39.105 --> 00:06:42.450\nThis is my first snapshot,\nright, so I took a snapshot.\n\n136\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.734\nThose are now tied to that first snapshot.\n\n137\n00:06:43.734 --> 00:06:48.843\nAnd then here's the disk\nfiles without the 0001.\n\n138\n00:06:48.843 --> 00:06:53.858\nSo I've got snapshot files and\nones without 0001, right.\n\n139\n00:06:53.858 --> 00:06:55.400\nThese are the originals, okay.\n\n140\n00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.000\nNotice how I've got 16 original files,\nand I've got 16 snapshot files.\n\n141\n00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.060\nWhen I look at the original files,\nthey're 4 gigs each, 4.25 gigs each.\n\n142\n00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.630\nWhen I look at the snapshot files,\nthey're only 524 K each, they're empty.\n\n143\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.140\nIt created duplicate files that are empty.\n\n144\n00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.240\nAnd as I make changes, the changes will\nget written to these files, right.\n\n145\n00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.380\nThe changes won't get\nwritten to the original.\n\n146\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.800\nThe originals will be preserved\nin their original format so\n\n147\n00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.970\nthat I can roll back, all right.\n\n148\n00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.400\nAnd then if I continue to look down,\nthere's my vmx file,\n\n149\n00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.340\nmy virtual hardware right?\n\n150\n00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.491\nBut the virtual hardware's also being\nstore as part at that snapshot.\n\n151\n00:07:35.491 --> 00:07:40.990\nAnd so if I look right here,\nWIN-CLIENT01-Snapshot.vmsn,\n\n152\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.780\nthat's defining the snapshot and\nthe hardware configuration.\n\n153\n00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.514\nAnd it's considerably larger\nthan the actual config file.\n\n154\n00:07:49.514 --> 00:07:52.614\nThe actual config file was weighing\nin at like four kilobytes in size.\n\n155\n00:07:52.614 --> 00:07:55.545\nThis one's 33 kilobytes, so\nit's significantly bigger.\n\n156\n00:07:55.545 --> 00:07:57.642\nBut it's got a lot more information for\nthat snapshot.\n\n157\n00:07:57.642 --> 00:08:01.959\nNow, if I boot the machine up and start\nto change things, right, so let's, oops.\n\n158\n00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.399\nLet's not take another snapshot.\n\n159\n00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:04.334\nLet's just turn it on.\n\n160\n00:08:04.334 --> 00:08:09.405\nSo I'm gonna boot this machine up and as\nit boots, I'm immediately making changes.\n\n161\n00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:12.820\nBecause Windows has a page file that\nit updates, and a hibernation file,\n\n162\n00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.220\nand temporary files.\n\n163\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.900\nIt writes during boot time.\n\n164\n00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.470\nAnd so it's making changes already.\n\n165\n00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.920\nBut those changes aren't be written to\nthe original files they are being written\n\n166\n00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.880\nto the snapshot files.\n\n167\n00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:30.050\nAnd every time I read from the hard drive\nI look the snapshot files first and\n\n168\n00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.610\nthen I look at the original files to get\nat my data right so there's a little bit\n\n169\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.360\nof extra work having to go on when we\nread data when we use the snapshot.\n\n170\n00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.850\nThat extra work equates to poor disk I/O.\n\n171\n00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.380\nNot super poor, but it's definitely\nless speedy than it would be without\n\n172\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.350\na snapshot, and that's a key\nconcept that I need to relate here.\n\n173\n00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.510\nI doubt it would be on the exam, but for\nreal life land Snapshots not good for\n\n174\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.990\nperformance.\n\n175\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.710\nIt used to be that you'd\nread from one disk file.\n\n176\n00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.180\nNow you have to read from two disk files.\n\n177\n00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.600\nYou have to look at the snapshot to see if\nthere's change data, and if there isn't,\n\n178\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.490\nthen you've gotta look at the original\nfile to find the original data.\n\n179\n00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.310\nSo you're doing two lookups for\ndata instead of one.\n\n180\n00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.637\nThat's gonna be slower\nperformance on disk I/O.\n\n181\n00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.373\nEven worse, let's say I,\nin another episode,\n\n182\n00:09:17.373 --> 00:09:22.560\nwe talked about thin provision disks, or\ndynamically expanding versus fixed disks.\n\n183\n00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.410\nAnd I said how in a production system,\nyou want your hard drives,\n\n184\n00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.210\nyour virtual hard drives to be fixed.\n\n185\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.980\nBut if it's a 64 gig drive, we want\nto lay out all 64 gigs right now, so\n\n186\n00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.460\nit's all provisioned out immediately.\n\n187\n00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.090\nAnd it's all nice and in a row and\nwe get great performance.\n\n188\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.680\nBut the instant you take a snapshot,\nyour snapshot files are dynamic.\n\n189\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.610\nRemember, you saw mine.\n\n190\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.170\nThey were all 524K.\n\n191\n00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.570\nThey're gonna grow as\nchanges get put in there, and\n\n192\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.840\nthat means I'm not getting the performance\nof the dynamic disk, even if my underlying\n\n193\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.350\ndisks are thick-provisioned,\neven if they're fully laid out and fixed.\n\n194\n00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.750\nSo on the disk I/O side,\nsnapshots hurt your performance.\n\n195\n00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.360\nThat's the lesson that I'm gonna impart.\n\n196\n00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.860\nIf you remember nothing\nelse from this episode,\n\n197\n00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.960\nremember that snapshots are performance.\n\n198\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.980\nIn a dev or test environment,\nwe don't care about that.\n\n199\n00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.350\nWorks great, use Snapshots like crazy.\n\n200\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.110\nTake layered ones.\n\n201\n00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.200\nI'll have some five,\nsix layers deep sometimes.\n\n202\n00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.730\nIn a production environment,\nyou want none.\n\n203\n00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.570\nSo you'd take a snapshot, you take one\nsnapshot, you make your risky change.\n\n204\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.390\nOnce you've proven that your\nrisky change works out okay,\n\n205\n00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.340\neverything's good,\nyou delete the snapshot.\n\n206\n00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.810\nAnd when you delete the snapshot,\n\n207\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.590\nthat merges your changes back\ninto the original files.\n\n208\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.310\nBut if you leave that snapshot there,\n\n209\n00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.450\nyou're gonna have degraded\ndisk I/O the whole time.\n\n210\n00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.370\nNot CPU, not RAM,\nnot network, just disk I/O.\n\n211\n00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.450\nThat's the one that gets affected.\n\n212\n00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:37.880\nSo be aware of that.\n\n213\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.560\nAll right, but\n\n214\n00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.160\nI just booted up this Windows 7 machine,\nand if I start to make changes on it,\n\n215\n00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.670\nlike I'm gonna take this I have a Windows\n10 ISO right here that's 3.8 gigs in size.\n\n216\n00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.360\nI'm gonna copy that and paste it,\nso I'm gonna have a second copy.\n\n217\n00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.950\nSo I'm generating 3.8 gigs\nof changes right here.\n\n218\n00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.940\nSo those changes are gonna happen and\n\n219\n00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.990\nthey're not being written\nto the original files.\n\n220\n00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.110\nThey're being written\nto the snapshot files.\n\n221\n00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.480\nAnd we'll see that here in just a second\nas soon as that is done copying.\n\n222\n00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.630\nAnd when that's done, we'll be able,\nactually, we should see it,\n\n223\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.750\nit's already half way.\n\n224\n00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.940\nSo, it's already written\na good chunk of data there,\n\n225\n00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.230\nit looks like one gig of data is written.\n\n226\n00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.870\nSo, if I jump back over to my disc,\nand start to look at those files,\n\n227\n00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.840\nlet's see what's new and\nexciting over here in our file end.\n\n228\n00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.771\nWell, here's my original files,\nVirtual disk-cl3-s001\n\n229\n00:11:26.771 --> 00:11:30.630\nthrough 16, and you'll see how most\nof them are 4 gigs in size, up to 11.\n\n230\n00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.170\nAnd after 11 it drops to 1 gig in size,\nand\n\n231\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.350\nthen we've got these reserve\nfiles that are just 524.\n\n232\n00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.460\nWith VMWare,\n524k is the smallest it will go.\n\n233\n00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.720\nBut if I look up into my snapshot files,\n\n234\n00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.300\nup here, I've got these guys,\nand they're starting to grow.\n\n235\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.838\nAnd if I look way down here, at number 11,\n\n236\n00:11:50.838 --> 00:11:55.389\ns011, it's now 3.36 gigs in size.\n\n237\n00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:55.980\nIt's started to grow.\n\n238\n00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.640\nSome of the others have grown too,\nfrom 524 K to 7 megs, not a lot.\n\n239\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.930\n8 megs.\n\n240\n00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.100\nBut some of the other ones,\n646 megs, right?\n\n241\n00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.150\nSignificantly bigger.\n\n242\n00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.740\nThey're growing.\n\n243\n00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.650\nThese are all the changes\nthat are happening, and\n\n244\n00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:13.350\nthose changes are part of the snapshot.\n\n245\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:17.230\nAnd so, when I read that disk image,\nthat ISO, when I go to get that ISO file,\n\n246\n00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.700\nit's gonna pull that out a snapshot\nfile which is dynamically expanding.\n\n247\n00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.410\nAnd so, that kinda hurts us a little bit\nbut that's now part of the snapshot.\n\n248\n00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.820\nYou can have more than one\nlayer of snapshot too.\n\n249\n00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.020\nWith your snapshot, it's really cool.\n\n250\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.950\nI took the snapshot of his\nmachine while it was off.\n\n251\n00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.880\nI could take a snapshot of the machine\nwhile it was on, while it was actually\n\n252\n00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.820\nup and running and you could get some neat\nresults when you do that because what it's\n\n253\n00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.580\ncapturing is not just the hard drive,\nnot just the configuration but\n\n254\n00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.220\nit's also getting the RAM,\nwhat's going on in RAM at that moment.\n\n255\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.330\nIf I roll this snapshot back, okay,\nso let me roll this snapshot back.\n\n256\n00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.000\nSo the machine is on right now.\n\n257\n00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.730\nIf I go back to my machine and\nI pull up the snapshot list, and\n\n258\n00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.010\nI'm just gonna roll it back.\n\n259\n00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:04.580\nI'm gonna choose prior to installing SP1,\nand I'll choose to restore that snapshot.\n\n260\n00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.190\nThis machine down here is on right now, so\n\n261\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:14.200\nif I take a snapshot of it now,\nit's a snapshot that's powered on.\n\n262\n00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.090\nSo it's gonna have that extra\nstuff that's apart of it.\n\n263\n00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.250\nWhen I go to restore this snapshot it's\ngonna ask me if I wanna take a snapshot of\n\n264\n00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.770\nwhat I've got right now.\n\n265\n00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.790\nSo it's saying we're\ngonna do a restore and\n\n266\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.990\ndo I wanna save the changes\nto the machine right now.\n\n267\n00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:30.020\nI'm gonna chose to save it aright and\nso by saving it.\n\n268\n00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.780\nIt's gonna make a new snapshot, so there\nit goes making a new snapshot of where we\n\n269\n00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.300\nare now, and then it's gonna\nroll me back to the other one.\n\n270\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.230\nNow when I took the other\nsnapshot the machine was off.\n\n271\n00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.860\nSo when it's done applying this snapshot,\nI'll be off again.\n\n272\n00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.400\nIt puts you back in the same state\nyou were when you took the snapshot.\n\n273\n00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.270\nSo now my Windows 7 machine should be off.\n\n274\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.030\nThere we go.\n\n275\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:56.560\nAnd I've got a branch in my snapshots\nright so here's the prior snapshot I made\n\n276\n00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.830\nand the current state where it rolled\nme back to that prior snapshot and\n\n277\n00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.270\nthen this branch in my timeline to this\nalternate reality to have right its\n\n278\n00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.070\nalmost like you're creating different\nuniverses this is the universe where I had\n\n279\n00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.480\nthe machine on and I installed\nservice pack one this is the universe\n\n280\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.902\nwhere I didn't install service pack one\nand I just decided to have a regular day.\n\n281\n00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:16.618\n>> It's like Doc Brown\nexplaining the alternate 1985.\n\n282\n00:14:16.618 --> 00:14:19.740\n>> There we go and\nwithout the 80 gigawatts of electricity or\n\n283\n00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.690\nwhatever we need.\n\n284\n00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:27.070\nSo if I fire this machine up,\nI won't have that copy of that ISO image.\n\n285\n00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.100\n>> That Windows 10 image.\nIt's put me back to the way it was and\n\n286\n00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.250\nthe way it did that was putting me\nback to the original snapshot, right.\n\n287\n00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.650\nBut because I still have\nthat snapshot there,\n\n288\n00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.630\nI'm still gonna be running\nin snapshot files.\n\n289\n00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.860\nAnd so technically now,\nI've got two snapshots, right.\n\n290\n00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.190\nA snapshot from before,\nI installed my service pack, and\n\n291\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.250\na snapshot from after,\nI installed the service pack.\n\n292\n00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.150\nAnd so if I go and\n\n293\n00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.740\nlook at the files for this,\nif I just dig back into my file system.\n\n294\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:15:00.380\nNow I've got that 00001 snapshot,\nand I've got a three.\n\n295\n00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.350\nWe skipped two for some reason.\n\n296\n00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.110\n>> I didn't like two.\n\n297\n00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.690\n>> I have no clue why.\n\n298\n00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.060\nMaybe it just likes odd numbers.\n\n299\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.390\nBut I can see that I've got\nthis extra snapshot now, and\n\n300\n00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.400\nI'm tracking yet another set of files.\n\n301\n00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.500\nAnd the more snapshots we create,\nthe more files we're tracking in again,\n\n302\n00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.980\nour disk performance\nstarts suffering as we go.\n\n303\n00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.270\nAnd that's not necessarily a good thing.\n\n304\n00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.580\nThere's no way to make\nthe snapshot files fixed in size,\n\n305\n00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.930\nit's gotta be dynamic and\nthat's kind of the way that that runs.\n\n306\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.120\nSo, now that the machine is up and\nrunning, I'm up,\n\n307\n00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.490\nI'm in this new alternate universe,\nthings are working great and\n\n308\n00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.310\nI can continue on as if I never\nran the service pack at all.\n\n309\n00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.440\nExcept the snapshots still exist.\n\n310\n00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.590\nI need to be aware of that.\n\n311\n00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:39.270\nThe snapshot exists, and as a result,\nI'm still using snapshot files.\n\n312\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:44.250\nI really need to delete the snapshot\nto move myself back to the way it was.\n\n313\n00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.270\nAnd when you delete a snapshot,\n\n314\n00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.740\nit's not an instantaneous thing\nbecause it has to merge your changes.\n\n315\n00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.435\nBack in to create the current state,\nto collapse all of that down.\n\n316\n00:15:52.435 --> 00:15:57.040\nAll right and you can't, some systems\nwill let you do it online, some won't.\n\n317\n00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.269\nI think VMWare Fusion will\nactually let me do it online.\n\n318\n00:15:59.269 --> 00:16:02.247\nWhere it will merge those changes while\nthe system is online and during that time\n\n319\n00:16:02.247 --> 00:16:05.180\nI'm going to have degraded disk IO there\ntoo cuz there's a lot of disk reads and\n\n320\n00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.700\ndisk writes as it merges those.\n\n321\n00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.180\nSo if I go back up here\ninto my snapshots and\n\n322\n00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.025\ngo and delete the snapshots that I've got.\n\n323\n00:16:13.025 --> 00:16:18.205\nWhen I do that I can take the snapshot\nfrom the failed update and\n\n324\n00:16:18.205 --> 00:16:18.995\njust delete that one.\n\n325\n00:16:18.995 --> 00:16:21.325\nThat's not a big deal cuz I'm not\neven running from that one anymore.\n\n326\n00:16:21.325 --> 00:16:22.605\nWhen I choose Delete,\nit's just gonna go and\n\n327\n00:16:22.605 --> 00:16:25.495\ndelete those files,\nthat's almost instantaneous.\n\n328\n00:16:25.495 --> 00:16:27.995\nBut if I go and\ndelete the original snapshot,\n\n329\n00:16:27.995 --> 00:16:31.940\nprior to installing Service Pack 1,\nif I delete that one, when it does that,\n\n330\n00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.740\nsee how it says disk cleanup after\ndeletion can take some time.\n\n331\n00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.160\nNice specific numbers there for us.\n\n332\n00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.880\nIt's gonna do it, and\nit's cleaning up the deleted files.\n\n333\n00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.900\nAnd the more changes I had the longer\nthat's gonna take cuz it's\n\n334\n00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.010\nmerging the changes back\ninto the original file.\n\n335\n00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.310\nAnd now I've got no snapshot.\n\n336\n00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.210\nAnd so if I go and\n\n337\n00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:56.400\nbrowse into those files again,\nwhich I've got open back here, all right.\n\n338\n00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.386\nThere's my disc files, and I no longer\nhave any of those snapshot files,\n\n339\n00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:04.114\nall those extra zero zero zero zero\none and so on, they're all gone,\n\n340\n00:17:04.114 --> 00:17:08.930\nsnapshot's gone, I'm back to regular\ndisc performance at this point, right.\n\n341\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.470\nSo that's a big deal, and\nI showed you a snapshot here and\n\n342\n00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.080\nI did the snapshot of\nthe machine that was off.\n\n343\n00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.640\nLet me show you what happens when this\nmachine is on cuz it's pretty neat.\n\n344\n00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:23.555\nSo if I jump over here to my machine,\nso here's that Windows 7 machine.\n\n345\n00:17:23.555 --> 00:17:26.285\nAnd let's say that I'm working in Notepad,\nright,\n\n346\n00:17:26.285 --> 00:17:27.725\nI'm doing some really important work.\n\n347\n00:17:27.725 --> 00:17:32.525\nThis is important work, right,\nand I'm not even gonna save this.\n\n348\n00:17:32.525 --> 00:17:36.245\nI'm not gonna save my Notepad document,\nI'm just gonna leave it open, right.\n\n349\n00:17:36.245 --> 00:17:40.555\nAnd I'm gonna take that snapshot, so\nI'll come down here and take my machine.\n\n350\n00:17:40.555 --> 00:17:45.510\nAnd we're gonna take a new snapshot, and\nI'll just call this demo two or something.\n\n351\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.750\nSo there, I got a nice little demo,\nsnapshot, all right.\n\n352\n00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.790\nNow I took the snapshot\nwhile the machine was on.\n\n353\n00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.651\nSo in addition to freezing\nthe hard drives, it also grabbed\n\n354\n00:17:55.651 --> 00:18:00.480\na copy of what was in RAM, right, what\nwas going on in that system at that time.\n\n355\n00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.580\nAnd so if I come over here and\nI close that document and\n\n356\n00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.900\nI tell it Don't Save, right, it's gone.\n\n357\n00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.670\nWhen you close a document like that and\nyou Don't Save it, it's gone forever.\n\n358\n00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:15.630\nIf I reboot the machine whatever was\nin RAM is gone forever, you've lost it.\n\n359\n00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.180\nBut I got a snapshot of my RAM and\nexactly how it was at that time.\n\n360\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.000\nAnd if I look at my system here,\n\n361\n00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.610\nif I just pull up my Task Manager, I can\nsee that I'm using about 2.2 gigs of RAM.\n\n362\n00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:29.390\nAnd so it had to do a snapshot\nof that 2.2 gigs of RAM.\n\n363\n00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:33.430\nIf you've got a 32 gig or 64 gig virtual\nmachine, it might have to take a snapshot\n\n364\n00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.580\nof the 64 gigs in size to grab\neverything that's in RAM at that time.\n\n365\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:41.190\nSo online snapshots can be a little\nspace consuming sometimes, right.\n\n366\n00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.130\nThe other thing is it took a snapshot\nof how the machine was at that time.\n\n367\n00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:49.530\nWhat if I was copying a file like earlier,\nright.\n\n368\n00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.580\nSo I'm gonna copy this file and paste it.\n\n369\n00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.730\nAnd if I take a snapshot while\nthat file is copying, right.\n\n370\n00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:59.480\nSo if I go up here to virtual machine and,\noops no, I'm gonna miss it.\n\n371\n00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.080\nWhere's my snapshot option?\n\n372\n00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.750\nShoot, let me go over here.\n\n373\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.020\nAnd I'm just gonna take a snapshot.\n\n374\n00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.360\nI'm trying to do this quickly, while\nit's copying that file, just take it.\n\n375\n00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:07.870\nThere.\n\n376\n00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.690\nSo, I'm taking a snapshot,\nwhile that file is writing.\n\n377\n00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:14.830\nI'm halfway through writing that file, and\nI'm over here taking the snapshot, okay.\n\n378\n00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.390\nI just took a snapshot\nhalfway through a write,\n\n379\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:22.280\nthis snapshot now is potentially at\nrisk of having corrupted data in it.\n\n380\n00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.070\nIf I was writing to a network resource,\nwhen I go to boot this snapshot back up\n\n381\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:29.760\nagain, that network resource might have\nchanged, the file might have changed.\n\n382\n00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.190\nAnd now I'm gonna try and push the second\nhalf of the file on top of it,\n\n383\n00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.640\nyou can damage data.\n\n384\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:39.080\nSo online snapshots for systems that are\ndoing a lot of writes is not a good idea,\n\n385\n00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.810\noffline snapshots are safer.\n\n386\n00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.170\nNow the operating system vendors have\ndone a lot to protect us from this.\n\n387\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.630\nSo Microsoft has Volume Shadow Copy which\nensures that you always get a clean\n\n388\n00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:48.420\nsnap shot.\n\n389\n00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.520\nAnd VMware Fusion, VMware ESX,\nthey work with Volume Shadow Copy,\n\n390\n00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.310\nnot every product out there does.\n\n391\n00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.337\nAnd so\nif you don't have the agents installed for\n\n392\n00:19:57.337 --> 00:19:59.224\nthat you can end up with\nsome problems there.\n\n393\n00:19:59.224 --> 00:20:03.476\nI think Virtual Box does too,\nlet me fire up Virtual Box.\n\n394\n00:20:03.476 --> 00:20:05.947\nAnd, does it say it?\n\n395\n00:20:05.947 --> 00:20:07.677\nActually it's not calling it out here, but\n\n396\n00:20:07.677 --> 00:20:11.093\nsometimes you'll see it like this where\nwe've got Hyper-V Paravirtualizaton where\n\n397\n00:20:11.093 --> 00:20:13.073\nit will actually interact\nwith Lime Shadow Copy.\n\n398\n00:20:13.073 --> 00:20:14.711\nSome of them do, some of them don't,\n\n399\n00:20:14.711 --> 00:20:18.297\ndefinitely test it in your environment to\nsee if it works with your software because\n\n400\n00:20:18.297 --> 00:20:20.930\nyou don't want corrupt data\nin your snapshots, all right.\n\n401\n00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:26.030\nNow, all of these snapshots were taken\nwhile the system was up and running, okay.\n\n402\n00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.290\nSo if I go over here and\ntake this virtual machine, and\n\n403\n00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.830\nI'm just gonna shut it down, right.\n\n404\n00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.220\nShoot, what is it doing.\n\n405\n00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.220\nJust cancel that.\n\n406\n00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.400\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nshut it down, and wonderful,\n\n407\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.720\nit's gonna apply some updates.\n\n408\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.133\nWell I definitely want that, right.\n\n409\n00:20:40.133 --> 00:20:43.820\nSo I actually don't want the updates,\nso maybe I'll do a hard shutdown.\n\n410\n00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.981\nI'm gonna take the machine and\njust yank its power, right.\n\n411\n00:20:46.981 --> 00:20:52.692\nSo let see, it's gonna make me shut down.\n\n412\n00:20:52.692 --> 00:20:54.410\nIt's still gonna do a graceful\nshut down isn't it?\n\n413\n00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.190\nShoot, all right, well I'll let\nit do its graceful shut down.\n\n414\n00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:02.194\nAnd when it shuts down, it's gonna power\noff, and the RAM is gonna empty out, okay.\n\n415\n00:21:02.194 --> 00:21:04.490\nSo the machine will be off, and\nthat will be the end of it.\n\n416\n00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.580\nSo in a second I should\nsee my big play button.\n\n417\n00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.360\nThere it is.\n\n418\n00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.780\nAnd now I'm off.\n\n419\n00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:09.890\nWell, if I go back here and\n\n420\n00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:15.160\nI restore my snapshot, when I restore\nit it's got what was in RAM also.\n\n421\n00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.520\nSo when I come in here and\nrestore that snapshot,\n\n422\n00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.950\nI'm not going to say\nwhat's going on right now.\n\n423\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:24.230\nIt's going to restore, and\nthen the machine is on again.\n\n424\n00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.054\nAnd not only is it on, there's Notepad and\n\n425\n00:21:26.054 --> 00:21:29.565\nthere's my document I never saved in\nthe first place, that's coming out of RAM.\n\n426\n00:21:29.565 --> 00:21:32.560\nAnd see how it's taking a longer time to\napply the snapshot because it's having to\n\n427\n00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.920\ncopy what it save from\nRAM into actual RAM.\n\n428\n00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.250\nAnd now it's here and I can start\nworking with this document again\n\n429\n00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:43.420\njust like it never rebooted,\nright, that's the cool part.\n\n430\n00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.480\nBut just remember that\nRAMis taking up space.\n\n431\n00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.640\nIf I browse on my hard drive and\nlook at my system,\n\n432\n00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.870\nI've got some snapshot files\nagain just like before, right.\n\n433\n00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.400\nSo here's those snapshot files for\n\n434\n00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.660\nthe disk, and we've got snapshot files\nthat are containing what was in memory.\n\n435\n00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.920\nSo if I look down here,\nsee these Snapshot3.vmem, Snapshot4.vmem.\n\n436\n00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.480\nThat's the virtual memory files.\n\n437\n00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.650\nAnd if I look over here at the size\nof those, 4.29 gigs, right.\n\n438\n00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.745\nBecause I've assigned four gigs of\nmemory to this virtual machine and\n\n439\n00:22:11.745 --> 00:22:14.007\nit had to snapshot the whole\nfour gig file, right.\n\n440\n00:22:14.007 --> 00:22:16.690\nNow some of that memory's empty,\nso it writes that very fast.\n\n441\n00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:18.930\nBut some of the memory is full and\nthat's going to take a little longer so\n\n442\n00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.800\nthese snapshots are a little\nmore intensive, all right.\n\n443\n00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.070\nSo pretty neat little system there.\n\n444\n00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.060\nWe can take those snapshots and put them\nin place, and they can save your bacon.\n\n445\n00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.610\nThey've saved me more than once.\n\n446\n00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.270\nSomething goes wrong, no big deal\nI'll just roll back to snapshot.\n\n447\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.710\nProblem solved, right.\n\n448\n00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.600\nBut there are a few other considerations\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n449\n00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.190\nThere's some systems that do not\nplay well with snapshots, right.\n\n450\n00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.990\nMicrosoft Active Directory domain\ncontrollers do not play well\n\n451\n00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.500\nwith snapshots.\n\n452\n00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.630\nDon't use them on a domain controller.\n\n453\n00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.260\nIf a change occurs on a domain controller,\n\n454\n00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.460\nit's replicated to other\ndomain controllers.\n\n455\n00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.840\nAnd when you restore a snapshot,\nit's like you took your DC and\n\n456\n00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.430\njust rolled it back in time.\n\n457\n00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.280\nAnd all the other domain controllers\nout there, they're gonna\n\n458\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.800\nsee that happening and they're just gonna\npush the changes back onto it and so\n\n459\n00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.530\nyou just lost the effect\nof having that snapshot.\n\n460\n00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.800\nThere's not a whole lot of point\ndoing it on a domain controller.\n\n461\n00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.910\nThe other thing to think\nabout is that snapshots might\n\n462\n00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.750\nat first look like a substitute for\nbackups.\n\n463\n00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:10.960\nI don't need to back\nup the server anymore,\n\n464\n00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.430\nI'm gonna take a snap shot, right.\n\n465\n00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.540\nSort of, right.\n\n466\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.970\nIf I have a bad service pack,\n\n467\n00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.560\nI can roll back to a snapshot instead of\ngoing to my backup and doing a restore.\n\n468\n00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.280\nSo in that aspect, yes, it replaces it.\n\n469\n00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.870\nBut there's a few other problems,\nlike our physical hardware.\n\n470\n00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.230\nSnapshots don't protect you\nfrom physical hardware.\n\n471\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.460\nWhere's the snapshot file stored?\n\n472\n00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.090\nRight in the same place as the regular\nVHD, the regular virtual hard drive.\n\n473\n00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.650\nSo if I lose my virtual hard drive,\nI lose the Snapshot too.\n\n474\n00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:36.800\nSo there's that.\n\n475\n00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.330\nAlso the snapshot is not a full complete\npicture of the virtual machine.\n\n476\n00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.610\nYou need a snapshots in\naddition to the regular drive\n\n477\n00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.220\nto put them together to\nget your current state.\n\n478\n00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.930\nAnd so if you don't have both,\nyou can't recover.\n\n479\n00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.263\nSo snapshots are not a replacement for\nbackups.\n\n480\n00:23:53.263 --> 00:23:57.218\nYou still need to back up your virtual\nmachines, otherwise you're gonna run that\n\n481\n00:23:57.218 --> 00:24:00.590\nrisk of having a failure and\nlosing the machine as a whole.\n\n482\n00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.180\nDon't stop running back ups.\n\n483\n00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.200\n>> Yeah, and\njust because we have the snapshots and\n\n484\n00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.880\nnot that we're saying don't use them.\n\n485\n00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.300\nObviously, we're saying use them.\n\n486\n00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.380\nThey are a great,\ngreat feature for you to employ.\n\n487\n00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:15.030\nJust you gotta know when and where\nit's appropriate to employ snapshots.\n\n488\n00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.950\nAnd as great as they are, if you're doing\nit wrong, you're going to lose data,\n\n489\n00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.950\nand then you're going to have that lovely,\nwhat do you call that Don?\n\n490\n00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.985\nA resumed generating event, RGE?\n\n491\n00:24:23.985 --> 00:24:24.640\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n492\n00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.680\nIt's not a good thing.\n\n493\n00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.100\nYou don't want to lose that data.\n\n494\n00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.455\nAnd on the exam, at CompTIA they\nactually call out in the exam objectives\n\n495\n00:24:31.455 --> 00:24:34.100\nfile-based back up versus\nimage-based back up.\n\n496\n00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.276\nSo let me talk about that for a second.\n\n497\n00:24:36.276 --> 00:24:40.370\nAn image-based back up is where we\ntake an image of a virtual machine\n\n498\n00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.890\nas it is right at that moment,\nwe just take an image of the whole thing,\n\n499\n00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.540\nvery similar to a snapshot, except the\nimage contains the whole machine, right?\n\n500\n00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.560\nAnd then you can take them and\nyou can restore it wherever you want,\n\n501\n00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.720\nyou can import it back\ninto another system.\n\n502\n00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.576\nThose image-based backups are really\nnice cuz you can restore very,\n\n503\n00:24:57.576 --> 00:24:59.416\nvery quickly from them, right?\n\n504\n00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:03.700\nBut they take a long time to make because\nyou're imaging the entire machine, and\n\n505\n00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.590\nif the machine is on while you do it,\n\n506\n00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.840\nyou run that risk of getting\ncorruptible data, right?\n\n507\n00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.610\nSo imag- based backups really\nexpect you to have the machine off.\n\n508\n00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.920\nYou power the machine off,\nyou take an image-based backup of it,\n\n509\n00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.650\nthen you can quickly\nrestore it anywhere else.\n\n510\n00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.690\nYou've got the whole thing right there.\n\n511\n00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.250\nA file-based backup though.\n\n512\n00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.010\nThat's the one we run from inside\nof the guest operating system.\n\n513\n00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.480\nSo in the guest OS, like Windows has\nthe Windows server backup utility, and\n\n514\n00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.480\nyou can use that to backup your files.\n\n515\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.950\nIn Linux you might run Bacula or\njust rSync, or\n\n516\n00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.130\nwhatever it is you want to\ndo to back up your files.\n\n517\n00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.040\nBy doing that,\nyou're backing up individual files, and\n\n518\n00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.940\nif you have some kind of disaster, you've\ngotta reinstall your operating system,\n\n519\n00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.950\nyou gotta build that up,\n\n520\n00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.700\nand then you can restore the backup\nto get all your data back.\n\n521\n00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.060\nIt takes a lot more work, it's slower,\nit takes longer to recover.\n\n522\n00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.140\nBut you don't have to turn the machine\noff to do a file-based backup,\n\n523\n00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.280\nyou can do online backups,\nyou can do them regularly, routinely.\n\n524\n00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.270\nAnd so, what I normally\nrecommend to people is that\n\n525\n00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.160\nyou do a mixture of the two.\n\n526\n00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.840\nMaybe once a month you do an image-based\nbackup where you back up the whole server.\n\n527\n00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.950\nAnd then every single day or even every\nsingle hour, you do file-based backups.\n\n528\n00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.950\nAnd that way when a disaster happens\nyou can take your image-based backup\n\n529\n00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.270\nto get the server up and\nrunning really quick and\n\n530\n00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:17.030\nthen you use your file-based backup to\nrestore the files that have changed,\n\n531\n00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.860\nto get you right back up\nto the point of failure.\n\n532\n00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.490\nSo, it's not a matter of picking\none technology over another one,\n\n533\n00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:22.970\nalthough you certainly can.\n\n534\n00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.680\nIt's better to use them both and\nget the best of both worlds.\n\n535\n00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.930\nAnd for that image-based backup,\nI don't necessarily need special software.\n\n536\n00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:30.520\nI mean, you can.\n\n537\n00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.530\nYou can use Acronis True Image, which is\na great product, a Paragon Drive back up,\n\n538\n00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.750\nI love that one.\n\n539\n00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.450\nThere's other vendors, Symantec Ghost,\nI don't care for that one anymore.\n\n540\n00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.590\nThey used to be the go-to one,\nyeah, and now not so much.\n\n541\n00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.010\nMicrosoft has Image X or\nwhatever they call it now,\n\n542\n00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:48.557\nit's got of a different name now, so\nyou've got all these different other\n\n543\n00:26:48.557 --> 00:26:52.443\nproducts that are out there that you can\nuse, but your virtualization platform,\n\n544\n00:26:52.443 --> 00:26:55.169\nmore than likely,\nhas functionality built into it too.\n\n545\n00:26:55.169 --> 00:26:57.540\nThey normally just call it import and\nexport though, right?\n\n546\n00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.260\nSo, like VMware Fusion,\nif I get back to my little panel here,\n\n547\n00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:07.290\nI could take a machine like this\nWindows client and if you take it,\n\n548\n00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.430\nyou'll usually see like an export option.\n\n549\n00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.300\nI've got creating a clone or a link clone.\n\n550\n00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.530\nWe talked about clones in another episode.\n\n551\n00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:18.160\nI've got my snapshots, which is exciting,\nbut I\"m not seeing an export option,\n\n552\n00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.180\nwhich I could have swore that we had.\n\n553\n00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.080\nLet me see if we've got.\n\n554\n00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.770\nThere's import.\n\n555\n00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:25.190\nIt may not support exporting.\n\n556\n00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:28.349\nIt's got this export to OVF,\nwhich maybe because the machine is on,\n\n557\n00:27:28.349 --> 00:27:29.229\nit's not giving.\n\n558\n00:27:29.229 --> 00:27:30.740\nThat's it.\nIt's the machine's on.\n\n559\n00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.620\nSo if I were to power off the machine, so\n\n560\n00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.300\nlike I've got this Windows\nserver here that's powered off.\n\n561\n00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:40.562\nI can go up here to file and\nunder file I've got Export OVF, okay.\n\n562\n00:27:40.562 --> 00:27:44.309\nAn OVF is an open virtual machine\nformat file and what it does,\n\n563\n00:27:44.309 --> 00:27:47.930\nis it lets you export your\nvirtual machine as a single file.\n\n564\n00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.900\nIt's the entire machine in this\nconfiguration and then you go and\n\n565\n00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:56.870\nimport it and Citrix Xen Server,\nKVM, VM Ware all support OVF's.\n\n566\n00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.840\nSo I could build a virtual machine here in\nVM Ware Fusion, export it as an OVF and\n\n567\n00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.840\nthen go and import it into ESX, and\nhave it up and running in short order.\n\n568\n00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.860\nBut I could use that as\nan image-based back up and\n\n569\n00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.810\nI don't have to go buy third\nparty back up software.\n\n570\n00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.540\nThird party software's nice but\nI don't necessarily have to have it.\n\n571\n00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.630\nI could use this.\n\n572\n00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.160\nThe export though does take some time.\n\n573\n00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.590\nI can't schedule it like I could\nwith other backup software, so\n\n574\n00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.060\nthat might be a reason you go and\ndo it with another one.\n\n575\n00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.900\nAnd then if I have a problem I can go to\nany of my virtualization infrastructure,\n\n576\n00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.420\nand I can choose to import.\n\n577\n00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.705\nAnd I can specify that OVF file that was\ngenerated, it will import the machine with\n\n578\n00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:30.840\nthis configuration, bring it online,\nand now we're back in business.\n\n579\n00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.280\nSo that type of backup would\nbe an image-based backup.\n\n580\n00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.460\nIf I want a file-based backup,\nit would depend on my guest OS.\n\n581\n00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.710\nSo whatever guest operating system it is\nthat I'm running, I'd go in there, I'd\n\n582\n00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.560\nfire up the backup software in there and\ndo my backups just like a physical server.\n\n583\n00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.910\nReally no different.\n\n584\n00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:46.680\nAnd then, off to the races, right?\n\n585\n00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.310\nSo backups are important, snapshots\nare not a replacement for backups.\n\n586\n00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.250\nYou really need to use both.\n\n587\n00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.730\nAnd then, I can't emphasize this enough.\n\n588\n00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:56.880\nWhen you're done with your snapshots,\n\n589\n00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.820\nmake sure you delete them cuz they\nare hurting your performance.\n\n590\n00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.040\n>> Yeah, it's a good way to get a call\ninto the office of the boss there.\n\n591\n00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.870\nGonna be like,\nwhat is going on with these snapshots.\n\n592\n00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:06.780\nYou just start deleting.\n\n593\n00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.162\nNot that I'm speaking from experience or\nanything like that at all.\n\n594\n00:29:10.162 --> 00:29:11.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right Don,\n\n595\n00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.510\nwell we covered a lot of ground when\nit comes to the Snapshots and backups.\n\n596\n00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.840\nIs there anything else that\nwe need to go over as far as\n\n597\n00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.460\ntrying to maintain our data's\nintegrity in that way?\n\n598\n00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.630\n>> I think that's really about it for\nSnapshots.\n\n599\n00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.150\nObviously we've got a lot more storage\ntechnologies that we're gonna get into.\n\n600\n00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.880\nWe have a whole section on storage\ntechnology we'll get into later.\n\n601\n00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.620\nBut the snapshots\nare pretty straightforward.\n\n602\n00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.520\nThey are a great technology.\n\n603\n00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.620\nDon't be afraid to use them, just remember\nto clean up your mess afterwards.\n\n604\n00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.670\n>> All right, thanks again for\njoining us, Don.\n\n605\n00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:39.690\nAppreciate you guys always showing up and\ngiving us great information like this,\n\n606\n00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:43.210\nthat is not only good for the exam,\nbut practical in real life as well.\n\n607\n00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.710\nWe also thank you guys for watching.\n\n608\n00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.300\nWe enjoy all of our members out there.\n\n609\n00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.550\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n610\n00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.700\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n611\n00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.330\n>> And I'm Don Pizet.\n\n612\n00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.638\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n613\n00:29:53.638 --> 00:30:01.570\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n",

everyone.\n\n4\n00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:17.010\nEveryone and welcome to another\ngreat episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.660\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.650\nwell we are continuing on with\nour Cloud+ series for CompTIA.\n\n7\n00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.680\nJoining us yet again today is our mentor.\n\n8\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.915\nYou know, you love him.\n\n9\n00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:27.670\nHe is the man.\n\n10\n00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.735\nMr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:30.005\nDon welcome to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.585\n>> Thank you for\nthe amazing intro as always, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:34.020\n>> I like to build you up.\n\n14\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.485\n[LAUGH]\n>> So we can all watch it fall.\n\n15\n00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:37.845\nReady to jump back into\nthe world of virtualization.\n\n16\n00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:41.105\nAnd in this episode we're\ngonna start tackling storage.\n\n17\n00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:44.655\nAnd I know most of you guys have with\ncomputers and service for quite some time.\n\n18\n00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:48.135\nAnd so the idea of talking about\nhard drives is somewhat boring.\n\n19\n00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:51.920\nBut in a virtualized\nenvironment it is very,\n\n20\n00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.070\nvery common that you are gonna have a SAN,\na Storage Area Network.\n\n21\n00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.770\nAnd for those of you that haven't\nworked with SANs before I wanna\n\n22\n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.450\ntake some time to explain, what is a SAN,\nwhat it does, how they work.\n\n23\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.120\nAnd some of the different components and\ninfrastructure we've gotta be aware of\n\n24\n00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.490\nespecially when deploying\nin a virtual environment.\n\n25\n00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.460\nSo that's what this episode\nis gonna be all about,\n\n26\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.910\njust kinda figuring out those SANs and\nhow they work.\n\n27\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.940\n>> That's right.\nEverybody put your big boy, or\n\n28\n00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.150\nbig girl pants on today,\nbecause SANs is where it's at.\n\n29\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.520\nIt is, just an industry standard inside\nof any enterprise level system, so\n\n30\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.280\nwe're gonna have to work with them.\n\n31\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.335\nBut, that being said Don, they're not\nthe only like game in town SANs per se.\n\n32\n00:01:26.335 --> 00:01:28.435\nThere's some other types\nof stories as well.\n\n33\n00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:29.935\n>> Yeah you certainly\ndon't have to have them.\n\n34\n00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:32.745\nYou can always go with the original\ntype of storage and there's several\n\n35\n00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:35.260\nmiddle grounds that you can go with\nthat all suck but they're there.\n\n36\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.715\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That you can use.\n\n37\n00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:41.155\nThey are appropriate in some small\nbusiness type environments but\n\n38\n00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:42.205\nin the enterprise world and\n\n39\n00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:45.075\nlarge business world it's gonna\nbe about storage area networks.\n\n40\n00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:48.490\nSo let's talk a little about the old\nsolution, the old way of doing things.\n\n41\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.090\nSo, the old way of doing things was to use\nwhat was called direct attached storage.\n\n42\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.750\nAnd that's where if you had a server,\nits storage was directly attached to it,\n\n43\n00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.702\nmuch like my laptop here, right.\n\n44\n00:01:57.702 --> 00:01:59.980\nSo, I've got a drive\ninside of my laptop and\n\n45\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.465\nit's directly attached inside\nthe laptop and that's it.\n\n46\n00:02:03.465 --> 00:02:05.895\nI have access to it,\nnobody else does, all right.\n\n47\n00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:08.655\nIf somebody else wants access to\nthe storage inside of my laptop I have to\n\n48\n00:02:08.655 --> 00:02:10.855\nshare it over the network.\n\n49\n00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:13.590\nAnd then they can browse to it over\nthe network and gain access to it.\n\n50\n00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.550\nThen it's what's called\nnetwork attach storage right?\n\n51\n00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.320\nSo direct attach is plugged\ndirectly into my system,\n\n52\n00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.310\nnetwork attached it's available\nover the network right?\n\n53\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.050\nSo I've got a little diagram\nkind of whipped up here and\n\n54\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.520\nI've got four virtual machine hosts right.\n\n55\n00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.040\nSo VMHOST01 through 04.\n\n56\n00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.610\nSo let's say that these guys\nare all running VMware ESX, or\n\n57\n00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.310\nthey're all running Hyper-V or\nwhatever product it is.\n\n58\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.530\nAnd they've all got a terabyte\nof storage each, so\n\n59\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.370\nthey've each got terabyte\ndrives directly attached.\n\n60\n00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.080\nAnd I bring up a virtual machine\nlike this guy, VM WEB01.\n\n61\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.170\nAnd VM WEB01 is right here on the direct\nattached storage on VMHOST01.\n\n62\n00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.180\nAnd it's running great.\n\n63\n00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.759\nAnd then one day, VMHOST01 fails, right.\n\n64\n00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.730\nMaybe it's not even a failure,\n\n65\n00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.350\nmaybe I need to reboot VMHOST01\nto apply some updates.\n\n66\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.080\nLet's go a little less nefarious here,\n\n67\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.500\nsomething that we know is gonna\nhappen at least once a month.\n\n68\n00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.490\nI need to update that host and\nI've gotta reboot it.\n\n69\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.325\nWell, if WEB01 is running right here\non the direct attached doors for\n\n70\n00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:15.160\nVMHOST01 when I reboot it\nwhat's gonna happen to WEB01?\n\n71\n00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.550\nIt's going to go offline,\nI'm going to have to take it offline.\n\n72\n00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.308\nNow, I can probably suspend the machine,\nright, freeze it in time,\n\n73\n00:03:22.308 --> 00:03:25.547\nreboot VMHOST01 and then unfreeze WEB01.\n\n74\n00:03:25.547 --> 00:03:28.730\nAnd when you do that WEB01 won't\neven realize that it went down.\n\n75\n00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.500\nBut, your end users will realize it went\ndown because it wont be available during\n\n76\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.910\nthat whole reboot.\n\n77\n00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.320\nWouldn't it be nice to say hey\nI'm about to reboot VMHOST01, so\n\n78\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.030\nlet me just move WEB01 over to one\nof these other servers, right?\n\n79\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.835\nSo I\"ll just move it over here.\n\n80\n00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:43.640\nAnd when we do that,\nit's up and going, right.\n\n81\n00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.610\nBut the problem is,\nthe virtual hard drives are stored\n\n82\n00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.029\nright here in this direct attach storage\nthat is only available on VMHOST01 and\n\n83\n00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:54.010\nthat's it like I described earlier.\n\n84\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.350\nNow if I choose to make that\navailable on the network so\n\n85\n00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.590\nthat other people can get to it, then it\nwould be network attached storage, right.\n\n86\n00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.070\nAnd network attached storage\nlooks something like this.\n\n87\n00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.310\nNow I've got my hosts, and they're all\nplugged into a switch, into a network.\n\n88\n00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.670\nAnd so they can see each other's storage.\n\n89\n00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.440\nBut if I review VMHOST01,\nwhat's going to happen with this storage?\n\n90\n00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.370\nIt's gonna go offline, doesn't\nmatter if it's on a network or not,\n\n91\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.600\nwhen the machines rebooting,\nI'm gonna lose that storage.\n\n92\n00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.630\nSo it doesn't quite work,\nunless we buy something like a NAS.\n\n93\n00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.750\nNAS is network attached\nstorage in a true form.\n\n94\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.740\nIt's not a server that's\ndoing other things,\n\n95\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.900\nit's not running virtualization software.\n\n96\n00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.510\nIt's just a box with hard drives in it\nthat's plugged into the network that's\n\n97\n00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.750\nvisible as long as it's been turned on.\n\n98\n00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.140\nAnd so, I could put my virtual hard drives\nhere on direct attach storage that's\n\n99\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.080\ninside of the NAS and then everybody\ncould access it over the network.\n\n100\n00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.900\nAll right?\nSo that is an option that's out there and\n\n101\n00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.160\nit's an inexpensive option.\n\n102\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.490\nThese NAS boxes, for network attach\nstorage like this you can get\n\n103\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.620\nBuffalo TeraStations,\nQNAP has some great stuff.\n\n104\n00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.970\nThere are several vendors out there\nthat make great network attached\n\n105\n00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.810\nstorage like this.\n\n106\n00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.080\nAnd it's inexpensive, it's great for\nsmall and medium businesses.\n\n107\n00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.290\nNotice I didn't say larger enterprise,\nwhy not?\n\n108\n00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.380\nWell performance on a NAS\nis not very good, right.\n\n109\n00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.380\nWhen I'm reading and\nwriting from direct attached storage, so\n\n110\n00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.300\nlike in this example here when this VMHOST\nis reading and writing through its direct\n\n111\n00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.300\nattached storage that might be SCSI it\nmight be SATA, it might be IDE who knows.\n\n112\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.940\nBut it's probably SCSI or\nSATA and it's able to right and\n\n113\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.750\nwrite to this directly connected\nstorage and it works great.\n\n114\n00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.930\nBut the instant we bring the network\ninto the picture, I can't send SCSI or\n\n115\n00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.000\nSATA over the network in its true form,\ncan I?\n\n116\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.160\nNo, it's an Ethernet-based network.\n\n117\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.420\nAnd so I'm gonna have to either use\na different protocol altogether, or\n\n118\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.080\nI'm gonna have to take SCSI or\nSATA or whatever, and\n\n119\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.060\nencapsulate it to travel over the network.\n\n120\n00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.680\nEither way, I've gotta modify my\ntraffic to work on this network.\n\n121\n00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.520\nAnd that modification takes time.\n\n122\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.080\nRemember several episodes ago where\nI talk about type two hypervisors and\n\n123\n00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.520\nhow they were bad because they had\nto translate your hardware calls?\n\n124\n00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.570\nWell, using network attach storage for\nyour virtual machine storage will\n\n125\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.070\nalso have to translate those calls and\nhurt your performance.\n\n126\n00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.870\nStack on top of that that this network\nis just your traditional, regular,\n\n127\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.650\nrun of the mill Ethernet network.\n\n128\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.100\nIt might be a gigabit network.\n\n129\n00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.860\nLet's just say it's a gigabit network.\n\n130\n00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.480\nWell, when you buy SATA drives these\ndays they're three, six gigabit drives.\n\n131\n00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.560\nSo now my drive has an access speed\nthat's higher than the network speed.\n\n132\n00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.980\nI can't realize the full\npotential of my disks, right?\n\n133\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.330\nThe network is slower than\nthe disks themselves and\n\n134\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330\nthe network becomes the bottleneck.\n\n135\n00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.000\nSo, the other thing to think about is that\nnot only am I having to translate these\n\n136\n00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.140\ncalls, but this is just a run\nof the mill network, right?\n\n137\n00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.810\nIf we look at the diagram again, this is\njust a regular switch, Ethernet switch.\n\n138\n00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.580\nI'm probably using TCPIP\nto communicate here.\n\n139\n00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.120\nThis network attached storage, that might\nbe an Apple box doing Apple file protocol.\n\n140\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.900\nIt could be a Windows box using CIFS,\n\n141\n00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.270\nthe common internet file sharing, or\nSMB, server message block technology.\n\n142\n00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.580\nIt could be a Unix box running NFS,\nthe network file system.\n\n143\n00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.250\nBut either way, it's all running\nover a traditional network.\n\n144\n00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.980\nWhich means, the network could be used for\nother things.\n\n145\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.260\nmight have,\nTom in accounting plugs in his laptop, and\n\n146\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.110\nstarts running bit torrents\nout to the Internet, right.\n\n147\n00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.960\nOr just starts doing other things,\nchecking his email, right.\n\n148\n00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.790\nIt doesn't necessarily\nhave to be something bad.\n\n149\n00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.430\nBut now Tom is using some\nof that bandwidth and\n\n150\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.490\nyour servers are competing against it.\n\n151\n00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.785\nNetwork attached storage does\nnot give you good performance.\n\n152\n00:07:27.785 --> 00:07:29.730\nIt's quick and easy storage so\n\n153\n00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.860\nyou can throw on a regular network\nwhen you're on a shoestring budget.\n\n154\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.285\nThat's what it's designed for.\n\n155\n00:07:34.285 --> 00:07:36.080\nIt's not designed for performance.\n\n156\n00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.830\nSo you don't normally see this used for\nhosting virtual machines.\n\n157\n00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.410\nIn fact, if you fire up something like\nCitrix Xen server, Citrix Xen Server\n\n158\n00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.070\nwill let you mount network attached\nstorage to one of your VM hosts.\n\n159\n00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.909\nBut you can only use it to\nstore ISO images, right?\n\n160\n00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:54.369\nImages of CDs, so you can boot computers\nand install operating systems.\n\n161\n00:07:54.369 --> 00:07:55.648\nThe virtual hard drives for\n\n162\n00:07:55.648 --> 00:07:59.547\nthe VMs themselves aren't allowed to be\nable to be stored on that network storage.\n\n163\n00:07:59.547 --> 00:08:03.614\nThey have to be stored either on\ndirect-attached storage or a true SAN,\n\n164\n00:08:03.614 --> 00:08:04.290\nall right?\n\n165\n00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.965\nAnd network-attached\nstorage is not a true SAN.\n\n166\n00:08:07.965 --> 00:08:09.690\nIt's just running over\nthe regular network.\n\n167\n00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.605\nThey're shared folders.\n\n168\n00:08:10.605 --> 00:08:13.374\nIt's really no different than\ntaking a Windows or Mac machine,\n\n169\n00:08:13.374 --> 00:08:15.799\ncreating a shared folder and\nsharing it on the network.\n\n170\n00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:17.675\nThat's all a NAS does.\n\n171\n00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:21.139\nIt's not very sophisticated and\nit's definitely not tuned for performance.\n\n172\n00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:25.790\n>> Well, Don, we've got NASs, they're\ngreat for when we need them, obviously.\n\n173\n00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.970\nIs there anything else about them that\nwe need to know as far as, obviously,\n\n174\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.040\nas you've been saying, they're meant for\na smaller or shoestring budget, just for\n\n175\n00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.970\na specific pointed purposes.\n\n176\n00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.270\nOtherwise, we wanna go with the direct\naccess or, better yet, a SAN.\n\n177\n00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.310\n>> Right, now there is a little\nbit of a middle ground there.\n\n178\n00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.520\nThere are some NAS boxes,\nlike we have one here.\n\n179\n00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.968\nIt's, I don't know why I'm even looking\naround, it's behind some wall here.\n\n180\n00:08:45.968 --> 00:08:46.826\n>> [LAUGH] It's through the wall.\n\n181\n00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:49.607\n[LAUGH]\n>> We have a QNAP NAS here that we store\n\n182\n00:08:49.607 --> 00:08:50.915\na bunch of videos on.\n\n183\n00:08:50.915 --> 00:08:54.206\nAnd QNAP, they're really good about\nbuilding a ton of extra features into\n\n184\n00:08:54.206 --> 00:08:55.000\ntheir NAS boxes.\n\n185\n00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.186\nThey are just NAS boxes at\nthe end of the day, but\n\n186\n00:08:57.186 --> 00:08:59.785\nit's got a lot of advanced\nfunctionality in it.\n\n187\n00:08:59.785 --> 00:09:02.285\nAnd it supports a technology called iSCSI.\n\n188\n00:09:02.285 --> 00:09:03.855\niSCSI is one you'll hear about a lot.\n\n189\n00:09:03.855 --> 00:09:06.515\nAnd for those of you that are just\nlearning and getting into virtualization,\n\n190\n00:09:06.515 --> 00:09:10.245\nyou'll probably set up iSCSI yourself,\ncuz it is a neat one to work with.\n\n191\n00:09:10.245 --> 00:09:12.525\nYou can create a fake SAN, right?\n\n192\n00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:15.655\nAnd I'm being very clear there,\nit's a fake SAN.\n\n193\n00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:20.200\nYou'll see a lot of vendors out there\nthat say, here's our iSCSI SAN solution.\n\n194\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.077\nBecause they don't want to say,\nhere's our iSCSI fake SAN solution.\n\n195\n00:09:22.077 --> 00:09:24.150\nWell, that's what it is.\n\n196\n00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:29.130\niSCSI is a way where you can get cheap\nNAS, cheap network-attached storage,\n\n197\n00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.630\nplugged into your TCP/IP\nbased Ethernet network and\n\n198\n00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.730\nit can look like a SAN and\nit can act like a SAN.\n\n199\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.740\nAnd you can push SCSI,\nSCSI encapsulated over Ethernet,\n\n200\n00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.840\nthat's what iSCSI is, you can push\nthat over your regular network.\n\n201\n00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.840\nBut at the end of the day,\nit's still your regular network.\n\n202\n00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.240\nYou're still taking a performance hit cuz\nyou're having to encapsulate your data.\n\n203\n00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.520\nYou're still taking a performance hit cuz\nyou're competing against everybody else on\n\n204\n00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.520\nthe network.\n\n205\n00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.460\nAnd you're still taking a performance\nhit because even if no one else is using\n\n206\n00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.710\nthe network,\nTCP/IP itself has a lot of overhead.\n\n207\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.260\nYou have to generate checksums and\nsequence numbers and\n\n208\n00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.060\nthings have to be broken\nup into packets and frames.\n\n209\n00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.090\nAnd that's stuff that SCSI\ndoesn't normally have to do.\n\n210\n00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.760\nBut now we're forcing it to do it.\n\n211\n00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.430\nAnd we're going over a gigabit network,\nmaybe a ten gigabit network, but\n\n212\n00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.790\nnormally a gigabit network.\n\n213\n00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.660\nAnd we're just not getting\nthose same performance levels.\n\n214\n00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:25.070\nSo iSCSI is a fake SAN, but\nit looks a little more like a real SAN.\n\n215\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.120\nSo here we've got a,\nI'm going to call it a SAN, right?\n\n216\n00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.440\nAnd it's plugged into that regular\nTCP/IP Ethernet based network.\n\n217\n00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.550\nMy servers connect up to it, VMHOST01\nthrough 04, and they're able to store\n\n218\n00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:43.420\nthings like the hard drive for the WEB01\nVM, and they can access and boot from it.\n\n219\n00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.501\nNow, the cool part here is I could\nhave that virtual machine running\n\n220\n00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:48.656\nfrom VMHOST01.\n\n221\n00:10:48.656 --> 00:10:52.013\nAnd then if I need to\ntake VMHOST01 offline,\n\n222\n00:10:52.013 --> 00:10:56.770\nI can just migrate WEB01 over\nto one of these other hosts.\n\n223\n00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.240\nAnd when I do that, it can jump over and\nstart running from that other host, and\n\n224\n00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.560\nthe other host can see the storage\nright there on the iSCSI SAN.\n\n225\n00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.840\nAnd it's doing it via\nthe Ethernet network,\n\n226\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.110\nvia your TCP/IP based network,\nand it's just running it.\n\n227\n00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:15.440\nAll right, now, iSCSI was designed to\ncreate test and development environments.\n\n228\n00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.270\nI know some people who\nare using it in production.\n\n229\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.930\nYou certainly can do that.\n\n230\n00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.790\nI typically try not to, right?\n\n231\n00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.689\nIf you've got the budget to do a real SAN,\nyou need to do a real SAN.\n\n232\n00:11:22.689 --> 00:11:25.413\nIf you don't have the budget\nto do a real SAN,\n\n233\n00:11:25.413 --> 00:11:29.216\nyou need to go to something like\nMicrosoft Azure or Amazon AWS,\n\n234\n00:11:29.216 --> 00:11:33.500\nwhere you will be on a real SAN but\nyou don't have to pay for it, right?\n\n235\n00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.030\nBut iSCSI I use in test and\n\n236\n00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.850\ndev environments, environments where\nperformance is not my primary concern.\n\n237\n00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.960\nThat's really where it has a good fit.\n\n238\n00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.220\nBut it is well established,\nit's been around a long time.\n\n239\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.840\nLet's say that you're watching this and\nyou say, well, that's great, Don, but\n\n240\n00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.660\nI don't have that budget,\nI gotta go iSCSI.\n\n241\n00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.030\nThere are some things you can do\nto make iSCSI work better, right?\n\n242\n00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.720\nSo let me give you just a few tips.\n\n243\n00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.240\nFirst off, create a dedicated\nnetwork just for iSCSI, right?\n\n244\n00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.300\nJust because it supports TCP/IP and\nit runs over a regular network\n\n245\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.830\ndoesn't mean you should put\nit on the regular network.\n\n246\n00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.790\nGet a dedicated switch,\nrun dedicated cables,\n\n247\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.510\nhave dedicated network cards in\nyour servers just for iSCSI.\n\n248\n00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.590\nThat'll help out a lot, all right?\n\n249\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.550\nThe second thing is don't just\nbuy any old network card.\n\n250\n00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.900\nThere's a lot of network\ncards that are out there, but\n\n251\n00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.660\nonly some of them have\niSCSI support built in.\n\n252\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.057\nIf you go to Intel's website, they have\nsome Intel network adaptors that have\n\n253\n00:12:21.057 --> 00:12:22.916\niSCSI accelerators built into the board.\n\n254\n00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:25.476\nThat will help out a lot\nwith taking your iSCSI or\n\n255\n00:12:25.476 --> 00:12:29.572\ntaking regular SCSI communications and\nencapsulating them for TCP/IP and\n\n256\n00:12:29.572 --> 00:12:33.092\nde-encapsulating, unencapsulating,\nwhatever the word is,\n\n257\n00:12:33.092 --> 00:12:36.426\nunwrapping the thing, and\nbringing it back into the server.\n\n258\n00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:37.866\nThat'll make a big difference also.\n\n259\n00:12:37.866 --> 00:12:41.105\nOkay, so dedicated switch,\ndedicated network,\n\n260\n00:12:41.105 --> 00:12:44.310\nspecial network cards\nwith iSCSI acceleration.\n\n261\n00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.120\nThose three things,\n\n262\n00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.360\nif you do that, you can actually\nget iSCSI running pretty well.\n\n263\n00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.868\nAnd so if you've only got 10 or\n20 VMs running on a handful of hosts,\n\n264\n00:12:51.868 --> 00:12:54.720\niSCSI can actually work and\nyou could save a lot of money.\n\n265\n00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.960\nBut I don't like to do it.\n\n266\n00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.660\nIf I can avoid it, I'm not gonna do it.\n\n267\n00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.051\nI'm gonna go with a true SAN,\na true fibre channel SAN.\n\n268\n00:13:00.051 --> 00:13:04.814\nAll right, now, that word that I just\nsaid there, fibre channel, right?\n\n269\n00:13:04.814 --> 00:13:10.053\nFibre channel SANs are really\nthe standard in virtualization storage.\n\n270\n00:13:10.053 --> 00:13:13.520\nWe know with virtualization we want\nshared storage between all of our hosts.\n\n271\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.470\nWe need our hosts to be able to see\nthat storage and share it, okay?\n\n272\n00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.979\nBut we need it to be fast.\n\n273\n00:13:17.979 --> 00:13:21.632\nAnd preferably,\nif we're talking to the drives using SCSI,\n\n274\n00:13:21.632 --> 00:13:23.750\nwe'd like to just keep using SCSI.\n\n275\n00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.830\nAnd a fibre channel SAN\nallows you to do that.\n\n276\n00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.330\nAll right, let me show you a diagram here.\n\n277\n00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.590\nThis is what a typical fibre\nchannel SAN looks like.\n\n278\n00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.040\nWe've got a SAN, right?\n\n279\n00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.140\nIt's a giant box that's got\na bunch of hard drives in it.\n\n280\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.420\nIt could have 144, it could have 250\nhard drives, however many you need,\n\n281\n00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.880\nit could have 8 hard drives, right?\n\n282\n00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.880\nBut it's got a bunch of hard drives in it.\n\n283\n00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.480\nAnd in that SAN,\nwe're slicing up the storage\n\n284\n00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.310\nto give out to our virtual machines and\nvirtual machine hosts.\n\n285\n00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.950\nAnd it plugs into a switch,\nbut not just any old switch.\n\n286\n00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:55.000\nThis is a fiber optic switch\nthat is designed for SANs.\n\n287\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.720\nIt's not designed for TCP/IP and Ethernet,\nit's designed for Fibre Channel Protocol.\n\n288\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.660\nFCP, Fibre Channel Protocol.\n\n289\n00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.292\nFibre Channel Protocol allows us to\nsend SCSI traffic over the network,\n\n290\n00:14:06.292 --> 00:14:08.078\njust regular SCSI, SCSI traffic,\n\n291\n00:14:08.078 --> 00:14:11.870\nright over the network without\nhaving to translate it, right?\n\n292\n00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.540\nReally, really cool stuff there\nbecause it acts like a switch\n\n293\n00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.850\nwithout all the TCP/IP overhead and\nas a result it can go much faster.\n\n294\n00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.594\nThe cheapest fibre channel switches that\nyou can get these days are 6 gigabit per\n\n295\n00:14:23.594 --> 00:14:24.590\nport, right?\n\n296\n00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.300\nBut a lot of them are 8 or\neven 12 gigabit per port.\n\n297\n00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.090\nNotice that doesn't match\nup with the Ethernet side.\n\n298\n00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.770\nOn the Ethernet side,\n\n299\n00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:34.400\nwe went from 10 megabit to 100\nmegabit to a gigabit to 10 gigabit.\n\n300\n00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.290\nBut on the fibre channel side,\nthey started at 2 gigabit,\n\n301\n00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.760\nI guess there were some older ones, but\n2 gigs is the smallest you'll see today.\n\n302\n00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.007\nAnd then they went to 4 gig,\nthen 6 gig, then 8 gig, now 12 gig.\n\n303\n00:14:44.007 --> 00:14:46.410\nI don't know why they skipped 10,\nbut they did.\n\n304\n00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.820\nSo you get these kind of intervals, and\n\n305\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.750\nyou buy the switch that has\nthe speed that you need it.\n\n306\n00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:56.703\nAnd then on your servers, instead of using\na regular network card like you would with\n\n307\n00:14:56.703 --> 00:15:00.211\niSCSI, you use what's called an HBA,\na host bus adapter.\n\n308\n00:15:00.211 --> 00:15:03.190\nAnd the host bus adapter looks\njust like a network card.\n\n309\n00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.160\nIt looks like a network card\nwith a fiber jack on it.\n\n310\n00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.450\nExcept when you put it in, your computer\ndoesn't see it as a network card.\n\n311\n00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.450\nIt sees it as a hard drive controller.\n\n312\n00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.984\nIt thinks that it's a SCSI\nhard drive controller.\n\n313\n00:15:12.984 --> 00:15:14.920\nThat's what it sees.\n\n314\n00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.180\nIt has no idea that it's actually plugging\ninto a fibre channel network, right?\n\n315\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.820\nThe fibre channel network is\nnormally called your switch fabric.\n\n316\n00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.270\nSo the fabric would be this network\nthat's created around it and\n\n317\n00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.090\nthe HPA plugs right into that fabric.\n\n318\n00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.914\nThey like to use the term fabric as\nopposed to a network, because networks\n\n319\n00:15:32.914 --> 00:15:37.128\nassume you have addressing and hosts and\nmanagement, but a fabric just exists.\n\n320\n00:15:37.128 --> 00:15:39.391\nAll these things run through it and\nthey all interconnect.\n\n321\n00:15:39.391 --> 00:15:43.400\nSo this would be running\nto a dedicated connection.\n\n322\n00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.540\nWe'll still have networks, right?\n\n323\n00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.430\nThis blue line here,\nthat would be my regular network, and\n\n324\n00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.790\nthat would be a separate card, right?\n\n325\n00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.400\nI kinda drew them close together here,\nbut that would be separate.\n\n326\n00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.496\nAnd it would run to a network switch.\n\n327\n00:15:52.496 --> 00:15:54.747\nSo your network communications\nhappen on their own side.\n\n328\n00:15:54.747 --> 00:15:56.558\nYour fibre channel network is separate.\n\n329\n00:15:56.558 --> 00:15:58.451\nIt's not suitable for\nthings like browsing the Internet.\n\n330\n00:15:58.451 --> 00:16:00.494\nCuz we're not running TCP/IP on it.\n\n331\n00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:03.268\nYou're running FCP,\nFibre Channel Protocol.\n\n332\n00:16:03.268 --> 00:16:05.660\nThere's actually a few different\nprotocols you can run, but\n\n333\n00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.610\nFibre Channel Protocol is the most common.\n\n334\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:11.060\n>> So the only data that's running\nacross that Fiber Channel will be\n\n335\n00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.840\nthe VM data that's trying to\nconnect with the storage.\n\n336\n00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.780\n>> Yep.\nStorage, communications, and that's it.\n\n337\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:21.368\nThat's part of what a SAN brings us,\nand having that true fibre channel SAN.\n\n338\n00:16:21.368 --> 00:16:25.030\nNow, what Fibre Channel Protocol does,\nwhat FCP does, is it allows you to\n\n339\n00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.650\ntake this communication and send it over\nthe line without having to translate it.\n\n340\n00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.520\nAnd it does that by creating layers.\n\n341\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.640\nAnd I've got just a quick\nkind of chart here.\n\n342\n00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.300\nIn a Fibre Channel SAN,\nyou have five layers.\n\n343\n00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.990\nLet me comment on one thing\nthat always bugged me.\n\n344\n00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.760\nNotice how I wrote fibre, F-I-B-R-E.\n\n345\n00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.225\nI'm not European,\nI'm not feeling sophisticated today.\n\n346\n00:16:44.225 --> 00:16:46.230\nYou'll see this in real life.\n\n347\n00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.580\nWhen people are talking\nabout the standard, right,\n\n348\n00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:54.740\nabout the protocol standard itself,\nthey'll write F-I-B-R-E, fibre like that.\n\n349\n00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.831\nBut when they're talking\nabout the actual media for\n\n350\n00:16:56.831 --> 00:17:00.221\ncommunicating across like a fiber cable,\nthey'll write F-I-B-E-R, right.\n\n351\n00:17:00.221 --> 00:17:02.790\nSo a little bit of differentiation there,\none for the standard, one for\n\n352\n00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.540\nthe physical media.\n\n353\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.695\nIn real life, if you mix them up,\nit's no big deal, nobody really cares.\n\n354\n00:17:06.695 --> 00:17:10.887\nBut if you ever wonder why you keep seeing\nthe two different spellings, that's why.\n\n355\n00:17:10.887 --> 00:17:12.770\nAlthough it does give you\nthat European flair, so.\n\n356\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:13.699\n>> It does that.\n\n357\n00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:14.858\n>> Makes you seem smart.\n\n358\n00:17:14.858 --> 00:17:16.230\n>> [INAUDIBLE] a shirt with big lapels.\n\n359\n00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.544\n[LAUGH]\n>> There you go, fashion forward.\n\n360\n00:17:18.544 --> 00:17:21.847\nAll right, so Fibre Channel Protocol,\nit takes the communication and\n\n361\n00:17:21.847 --> 00:17:25.644\nit breaks it up into five layers, right,\nstarting with FC0, fiber channel 0,\n\n362\n00:17:25.644 --> 00:17:26.706\nall the way up to FC4.\n\n363\n00:17:26.706 --> 00:17:28.888\nFC0 refers to the physical\ninterface itself.\n\n364\n00:17:28.888 --> 00:17:32.671\nAnd on a regular system, it's normally\ngonna be like an LC connector,\n\n365\n00:17:32.671 --> 00:17:35.590\njust your fiber optic plug,\nthe really tiny one.\n\n366\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:36.260\nThat's what it's gonna be.\n\n367\n00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.900\nBut it could be something else,\nit could be SC or ST,\n\n368\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.170\nit could be a GBIC that you're\nplugging into or whatever.\n\n369\n00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.972\nBut you'll have that physical interface.\n\n370\n00:17:43.972 --> 00:17:47.100\nFC1, that's the encoding and decoding.\n\n371\n00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.940\nWhen you're sending data to your SCSI bus,\nit's electricity, right?\n\n372\n00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.097\nAnd you're sending ones and\nzeros over an electronic line.\n\n373\n00:17:53.097 --> 00:17:55.600\nBut when you hit the fiber,\nit's light, right?\n\n374\n00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.600\nWe're doing light pulses to represent it,\nso we've got to encode and decode and\n\n375\n00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.920\nwe've got to change our data to fit that.\n\n376\n00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.390\nAt FC2,\nthat's where we have our exchanges.\n\n377\n00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.950\nAnd our exchanges, this is where we're\ntalking about things like our frames and\n\n378\n00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.130\nour sequences.\n\n379\n00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.490\nIf I'm sending a collection of data\nit's all in multiple frames and\n\n380\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.510\nthey have sequence numbers to\nput them in the right order.\n\n381\n00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.210\nAnd so that's what's happening there\nat FC2 to make sure the exchange\n\n382\n00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.660\ngoes properly.\n\n383\n00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.040\nAt FC3,\nthat's where we have our common services.\n\n384\n00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.380\nThings like multicast,\nhow we can find the SAN, and hunt groups,\n\n385\n00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.680\nwhere if one SAN dies,\nwe look for the next one.\n\n386\n00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.320\nThose technologies are there.\n\n387\n00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.330\nBut the most important layer is FC4.\n\n388\n00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.909\nThis is the application layer.\n\n389\n00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:32.507\nAnd on a fibre channel SAN\nusing Fibre Channel Protocol,\n\n390\n00:18:32.507 --> 00:18:36.308\nthere's typically only one application\nwe really care about, and that's SCSI.\n\n391\n00:18:36.308 --> 00:18:38.522\nSCSI runs as an application on top of it,\nso\n\n392\n00:18:38.522 --> 00:18:42.828\nwe're able to send the SCSI communications\nand these other layers help to make sure\n\n393\n00:18:42.828 --> 00:18:46.550\nit gets to the right place without\nus having to mess with it, right.\n\n394\n00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.050\nWe're not having to reencapsulate or\nreencode or anything like that.\n\n395\n00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.890\nIt's designed to handle that traffic,\nwhich means you get wire speeds.\n\n396\n00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.765\nYou actually get better than\nwire speeds in some case,\n\n397\n00:18:54.765 --> 00:18:57.530\ns cuz you've got an electric impulse.\n\n398\n00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.750\nTechnically, I read this somewhere,\nin a vacuum with pure metals,\n\n399\n00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.590\nthe electrical impulse will cross\nthe line at the same speed as light.\n\n400\n00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.360\nAnd so fiber and\ncopper are really no different.\n\n401\n00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.730\nBut the problem is, in real life,\nyou have impurities in copper.\n\n402\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.790\nThe length of the copper\ndegrades the signal.\n\n403\n00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.093\nYou have resistance and, impedance?\n\n404\n00:19:14.093 --> 00:19:15.327\n>> Impedance.\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Say it right now,\n\n405\n00:19:15.327 --> 00:19:15.858\nimpedance, and.\n\n406\n00:19:15.858 --> 00:19:17.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so you have these different\n\n407\n00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.716\nthings that cause that copper line to\nnot perform at the same level as fiber,\n\n408\n00:19:20.716 --> 00:19:22.989\nwhereas fiber still performs\nat that same level, so\n\n409\n00:19:22.989 --> 00:19:26.740\nyou actually get better performance\nthan you would off of copper solutions.\n\n410\n00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.110\nSo when we have this in place, we get\na very reliable, scalable solution, and\n\n411\n00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.930\nthat's Fibre Channel Protocol, or FCP.\n\n412\n00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:38.070\nIt's really pretty powerful stuff,\nit's also pretty expensive.\n\n413\n00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.420\nWith iSCSI, we use our traditional\nnetwork, and so regular switches,\n\n414\n00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.910\nregular cables, regular stuff.\n\n415\n00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.690\nIt's slower, but it's cheap and\nyou probably already have it.\n\n416\n00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.707\nYou could deploy iSCSI right now without\nhaving to go out and buy new hardware.\n\n417\n00:19:48.707 --> 00:19:52.274\nBut with a Fibre Channel SAN, you gotta\nget a SAN that supports Fibre Channel,\n\n418\n00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:56.220\nyou gotta get a Fibre Channel switch,\nat least one, probably more than one.\n\n419\n00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.970\nYou need to get fiber-optic cables.\n\n420\n00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.220\nYou need to get dedicated fibre HBAs,\nnot just fiber network cards,\n\n421\n00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.750\nbut fibre HBAs for each of your hosts.\n\n422\n00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.480\nEach of your host machines\nhave to have that.\n\n423\n00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.250\nAnd so all of that equipment adds up and\nit gets expensive.\n\n424\n00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.264\nAnd it's pretty rare that you'd get\na good Fibre Channel SAN deployment for\n\n425\n00:20:12.264 --> 00:20:14.155\nless than like $50,000 US.\n\n426\n00:20:14.155 --> 00:20:15.351\nIt's a lot of money.\n\n427\n00:20:15.351 --> 00:20:17.420\nIf you're a small business,\nyou can't afford that.\n\n428\n00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.370\nWe don't have a Fibre Channel\nhere in the building with us.\n\n429\n00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.930\nWe also don't have a server,\nso it makes sense.\n\n430\n00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:22.480\n>> There's that.\n\n431\n00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.310\n>> But even if we wanted to,\nI'd probably go iSCSI here,\n\n432\n00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:29.520\nbecause it would make sense, that with the\nbudget, with the systems that you have,\n\n433\n00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.440\nwith the resources you need,\nthat's what you've got.\n\n434\n00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.990\nBut if performance is your main concern,\nyou're gonna go fiber.\n\n435\n00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.308\nAnd that's one of the big advantages\nof going with Amazon Web Services, or\n\n436\n00:20:37.308 --> 00:20:40.361\nMicrosoft Azure, or Google Compute,\nRackspace, all those guys,\n\n437\n00:20:40.361 --> 00:20:44.225\nis they've got massive Fibre Channel SANs\nthey've dumped millions of dollars into.\n\n438\n00:20:44.225 --> 00:20:47.410\nStuff that you couldn't afford yourself,\nbut you can use, right?\n\n439\n00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.830\nYou can rent, and tack onto it,\nand really get those benefits.\n\n440\n00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:51.940\nSo that's what I always tell people.\n\n441\n00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.120\nIf you're at that in-between state, don't\ndo iSCSI, just send it up to the cloud,\n\n442\n00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.420\nand that's exactly what we have done.\n\n443\n00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.720\nThe servers that we do have\nare all up in the cloud, and\n\n444\n00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.740\nthey are running on Fibre Channel SANs.\n\n445\n00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.970\n>> Now Don, you've talked about the FCP,\nthe Fibre Channel Protocol, but\n\n446\n00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:09.270\nI've also heard of the FCIP, the Fibre\nChannel over the Internet Protocol.\n\n447\n00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.140\nAnd that's,\nis that a little bit different,\n\n448\n00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.506\nor, why would we want to use one or\nthe other?\n\n449\n00:21:13.506 --> 00:21:16.695\n>> All right, so\nthe thing about Fibre Channel SANs,\n\n450\n00:21:16.695 --> 00:21:20.192\nis they expect the SAN to be\nright there beside systems.\n\n451\n00:21:20.192 --> 00:21:22.742\nRight, so even in my diagram,\nI've got servers, and\n\n452\n00:21:22.742 --> 00:21:25.500\nthey're plugged directly into this switch,\nright.\n\n453\n00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.790\nSo I'm assuming a cable here.\n\n454\n00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.710\nNow, how far can I run that cable?\n\n455\n00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.060\nWell, fiber optic cable,\n\n456\n00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.580\nyou can actually run it a couple of\nkilometers if you wanna go crazy.\n\n457\n00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.860\nBut the way this is implemented it's\nexpecting all the equipment to be\n\n458\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.410\nright next to each other.\n\n459\n00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.000\nBut one thing that you learn in IT\n\n460\n00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.740\npretty quick is that no system\nis completely reliable, so\n\n461\n00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.590\na lot of times you're going to want to\nset up not one SAN but multiple SANs.\n\n462\n00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.332\nSo I might have a SAN here in my local\narea network with a couple of nodes\n\n463\n00:21:50.332 --> 00:21:52.935\nattached to it and that shared storage and\neverything's great,\n\n464\n00:21:52.935 --> 00:21:55.380\nbut I might want to have\nanother SAN somewhere else.\n\n465\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.000\nAnd so here I've got a SAN in\na separate location, right?\n\n466\n00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.282\nSo I have SAN 1 and SAN 2, and I've got\nnodes over here and nodes on each side.\n\n467\n00:22:02.282 --> 00:22:06.860\nThis way, if one location completely dies,\nthe other location can be up and running.\n\n468\n00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.118\nWell, I need to replicate\ndata between those SANs.\n\n469\n00:22:10.118 --> 00:22:13.394\nAnd so a lot of the SANs that\nare out like, if you get an EMC SAN,\n\n470\n00:22:13.394 --> 00:22:15.922\nthey support replicating\nbetween each other.\n\n471\n00:22:15.922 --> 00:22:20.183\nAnd they way they replicate is by\ndoing Fibre Channel over IP, FCIP.\n\n472\n00:22:20.183 --> 00:22:23.630\nAnd that allows you to replicate\nthe data but at a performance hit.\n\n473\n00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:24.810\nObviously it's less bandwidth,\n\n474\n00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:28.490\nthere's more latency,\nthere's overhead from TCP/IP.\n\n475\n00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.990\nSo they don't stay in lockstep.\n\n476\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.770\nIt's not like the changes can\nbe instantaneously synchronized.\n\n477\n00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.481\nIf these two SANs were right next to\neach other, I could plug them both into\n\n478\n00:22:35.481 --> 00:22:38.468\nthe same Fibre Channel switch, and I could\nreplicate data and do it in real time.\n\n479\n00:22:38.468 --> 00:22:41.400\nWhen you write to one SAN,\nyou write to the other, and it's done.\n\n480\n00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.170\nCisco MDS switches have this really\ncool feature that does that.\n\n481\n00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.170\nIt intercepts the writes, and\nit just sends them two places.\n\n482\n00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.260\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\n483\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.570\nSo depending on the vendor of equipment\nyou have, you'll have different features.\n\n484\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.830\nBut when you replicate across a wide\narea network like this, right,\n\n485\n00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.810\ndifferent geographic regions\nare passing through a router,\n\n486\n00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.080\nyou need some way to route it,\nand SCSI doesn't have routing.\n\n487\n00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.890\nSCSI, you just see hard drives and\nyou write to them.\n\n488\n00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.350\nThere's no routing and\nsubnets or whatever.\n\n489\n00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.300\nSo we can use Fibre Channel\nover IP to do it.\n\n490\n00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.541\nAnd what FCIP does is it basically takes\nthe same stuff that we have here, but\n\n491\n00:23:11.541 --> 00:23:15.785\nit takes Fibre Channel zero and\nFiber Channel one, these first two layers,\n\n492\n00:23:15.785 --> 00:23:18.058\nand it replaces them with TCIP, right.\n\n493\n00:23:18.058 --> 00:23:20.554\nSo instead of encoding for\nlight or whatever,\n\n494\n00:23:20.554 --> 00:23:24.652\nwe're just gonna be breaking these up\ninto packets and frames for TCP/IP.\n\n495\n00:23:24.652 --> 00:23:27.512\nAnd our physical interface,\nthat's gonna be our copper media or\n\n496\n00:23:27.512 --> 00:23:30.840\nmaybe even fiber optic media that\nruns through an Ethernet network.\n\n497\n00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.130\nSo you get Ethernet combined with TCP/IP.\n\n498\n00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:37.623\nBut everything above it,\nF2, F3, F4, FC 2, 3, and 4.\n\n499\n00:23:37.623 --> 00:23:38.610\nThey all stay the same.\n\n500\n00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.453\nSo you still have your regular exchanges,\nyour services, and your application,\n\n501\n00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:43.621\nthey're just being wrapped up\ninside of TCP/IP, all right.\n\n502\n00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.940\nBut you're not really going to use this.\n\n503\n00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.408\nNobody uses this to say, I'm going to\nconnect this server to my SAN, and\n\n504\n00:23:49.408 --> 00:23:50.508\nI'm going to use FCIP, right.\n\n505\n00:23:50.508 --> 00:23:52.453\nBecause at that point,\nyou might as well use iSCSI,\n\n506\n00:23:52.453 --> 00:23:53.923\nit's gonna stink just as bad, right?\n\n507\n00:23:53.923 --> 00:23:58.264\nSo FCIP is really designed for\nreplicating in a multi-SAN environment.\n\n508\n00:23:58.264 --> 00:24:03.119\nWhen you're replicating between different\ngeographical locations, because regular\n\n509\n00:24:03.119 --> 00:24:07.725\nFCP can't be routed, FCIP can and because\nit's leveraging the TCP/IP protocol.\n\n510\n00:24:07.725 --> 00:24:09.780\nSo, pretty neat stuff there.\n\n511\n00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.220\nYou know, I was able to tackle that and\nkind of push it in place.\n\n512\n00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.550\nNow this whole time I've been\ntalking about SCSI a lot, right?\n\n513\n00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:19.110\nWhen you do fibre channel SANs,\nthey really do build all this off of SCSI.\n\n514\n00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:23.190\nSo you might have SATA, like Serial ATA,\nyou may have IDE, hopefully not, but\n\n515\n00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:24.310\nmaybe you do.\n\n516\n00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.140\nThose technologies are still out there,\nbut they're not used on SANs, and\n\n517\n00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.780\nit's because they don't, there's a couple\nreasons, but the main thing is that they\n\n518\n00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:35.350\ndon't perform as well, and\nthey can't address as many drives, right?\n\n519\n00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.100\nRemember on an IDE channel you can\nonly have two drives, a primary and\n\n520\n00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.160\na secondary.\n\n521\n00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.690\nOn a SATA channel you can only have\none drive, and that's it, right?\n\n522\n00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:47.185\nBut on SCSI, you can have, and I always\nscrew this up cuz of the reserve numbers,\n\n523\n00:24:47.185 --> 00:24:48.235\nbut it's like 15, or\n\n524\n00:24:48.235 --> 00:24:52.335\n14 drives on a single SCSI channel,\nso you can address a lot more drives.\n\n525\n00:24:52.335 --> 00:24:54.755\nAnd on a SAN, you're creating\na bunch of virtual drives, and\n\n526\n00:24:54.755 --> 00:24:56.305\nyou really need to be\nable to address that.\n\n527\n00:24:56.305 --> 00:24:59.248\nWhen you're talking about direct attach\ndoors, how many hard drives are you really\n\n528\n00:24:59.248 --> 00:25:01.121\ngonna have in one server\nwith direct attach storage?\n\n529\n00:25:01.121 --> 00:25:02.503\nNot that many.\n\n530\n00:25:02.503 --> 00:25:06.643\nBut when you do a SAN, and you've got\na rack of 250 drives, or maybe you've got\n\n531\n00:25:06.643 --> 00:25:10.585\nthree of these racks, you've got\nover 700 drives in there, right?\n\n532\n00:25:10.585 --> 00:25:12.910\nYou're slicing out drives,\ncreating virtual drives.\n\n533\n00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:17.220\nYou might have a 100 virtual drives and\ntrying to address that with IDE would\n\n534\n00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.779\nbe pretty hard, so\nthat's why they do it with SCSI.\n\n535\n00:25:19.779 --> 00:25:22.640\nYou get better performance,\nit's a well support protocol,\n\n536\n00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.090\nit's gonna be around a long time.\n\n537\n00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.670\nBut that's basically\nthe way that it works and\n\n538\n00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.250\nfibre channel is just a great\nway to communicate that.\n\n539\n00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.980\nNow, on the switch side, there's a couple\nof big vendors that are out there.\n\n540\n00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.180\nCisco has a big stake in it with their\nMDS switches, you also have Brocade,\n\n541\n00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.040\nwhich is one of the bigger\nones that are out there.\n\n542\n00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.370\nThere's a few other vendors that have kind\nof come and gone, and they get acquired,\n\n543\n00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.320\nlike EMC or Dell will buy one,\nHP will buy one, so\n\n544\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.980\nyou'll find a lot of people that have\ntheir own house brand of switches.\n\n545\n00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.630\nAt the end of the day it\ncomes down to features.\n\n546\n00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.520\nAnd I know I'm short on\ntime in this episode.\n\n547\n00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.040\nI have some other features I wanna\ntalk about like LUN masking and\n\n548\n00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.920\nstuff that we'll have to get into in the\nnext episode, but when you buy the switch,\n\n549\n00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.510\nthe base functionality is the same\nno matter what vendor it is.\n\n550\n00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.286\nBut you've gotta pay\nattention to throughput.\n\n551\n00:26:04.286 --> 00:26:07.987\nThe more systems you connect,\nthe more throughput you need, and\n\n552\n00:26:07.987 --> 00:26:10.352\nyou can exceed what your SAN has, right?\n\n553\n00:26:10.352 --> 00:26:12.372\nAnd then after that you\nworry about features, right?\n\n554\n00:26:12.372 --> 00:26:14.856\nDo I get these bells and whistles, or do I\nget those bells and whistles or whatever?\n\n555\n00:26:14.856 --> 00:26:16.720\nBut throughput is key.\n\n556\n00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.230\nAnd I didn't really show it in my diagram.\n\n557\n00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.420\nI should update this, but\nnotice how each server here\n\n558\n00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.550\nhas a dedicated link that's\nrunning down to this switch.\n\n559\n00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.590\nIf I want redundancy, I really need\ntwo switches, and two links so\n\n560\n00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:33.070\nthey have, what's called multipathing,\nor MPIO, multi path input output, so\n\n561\n00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.790\nthat they can get to the network, or get\nto the SAN, through two different paths.\n\n562\n00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.060\nIf one path fails,\nthe other one's still up.\n\n563\n00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.010\nBut your SAN needs the same thing.\n\n564\n00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.440\nSo when you buy a storage area network,\nit's normally gonna have two, or sometimes\n\n565\n00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.050\nfour connectors on the back to be able\nto run the switches to increase your\n\n566\n00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:52.470\nbandwidth and increase your redundancy,\nand you can really take advantage of that.\n\n567\n00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:53.920\nThat way if you have a link failure,\nyou're safe.\n\n568\n00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.769\nThere's a lot of other bells and whistles\nthat are out there, but if the server,\n\n569\n00:26:57.769 --> 00:27:01.110\nif the SAN only has one connector,\nand a server has one connector, and\n\n570\n00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.693\nthat server is running at 100%,\nnow your SAN's running at 100%.\n\n571\n00:27:04.693 --> 00:27:08.440\nWhat about these other three servers?\n\n572\n00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.910\nThey're out of luck, right?\n\n573\n00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:12.870\nSo if I'm going to be hooking four servers\nup, I've got to make sure that I've got\n\n574\n00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.470\nthe throughput to the SAN\nto be able to handle that.\n\n575\n00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:19.910\nAnd so, I might want to limit the disk IO\nallowed from each server to correct for\n\n576\n00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.690\nthat to create balance, or I can just\nlet it go and see how it works out.\n\n577\n00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.620\nBut you can oversubscribe the bandwidth\non your stand pretty easy.\n\n578\n00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.640\nSo, instead of having one SAN\nwith 750 drives, you might choose\n\n579\n00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.580\nto have three SANs with 250 drives each to\nhandle that throughput and performance.\n\n580\n00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.690\nSo that's all a part of sizing\nthe solution for your environment, and\n\n581\n00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.700\nit's stuff you'll have to think\nabout when you implement a SAN.\n\n582\n00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.890\n>> Yeah, well obviously SANs are not\na child's play thing, it is definitely\n\n583\n00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.300\na more complex type of technology that\nwe need to wrap our heads around.\n\n584\n00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.930\nBut Don, you've done a great job of\nat least explaining what a SAN is and\n\n585\n00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:56.110\nkind of how SANs work, so\nthat we can go into the next step, which\n\n586\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.070\nobviously we have a whole lot more we need\nto speak about when it comes to SANs.\n\n587\n00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.940\nWell, I guess we'll have to do\na Part 2 on this, look for it.\n\n588\n00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.460\nAny parting words of wisdom so\nfar as this episode goes?\n\n589\n00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.720\n>> Just that if you're wondering\nabout security this whole time,\n\n590\n00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.220\nwe really didn't address security at all,\nwe'll do that in part two.\n\n591\n00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.260\nWe need to talk about that because you\nhave, with direct attached storage,\n\n592\n00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.660\na hard drive's attached to one server,\nso it's got exclusive access.\n\n593\n00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.620\nBut when it's attached to a SAN,\ntechnically more than one server has\n\n594\n00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.960\naccess and you have some risks,\nsome issues there.\n\n595\n00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.840\nWe'll talk about those, how to address\nthem, how to fix them in the next part.\n\n596\n00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.990\n>> All right, Don,\nwell thank you so much, and\n\n597\n00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:28.032\nI look forward to seeing you in part two.\n\n598\n00:28:28.032 --> 00:28:30.969\nWe look forward to seeing everybody\nout there in part two as well.\n\n599\n00:28:30.969 --> 00:28:33.297\nThis is really good content,\nbut as for this episode goes,\n\n600\n00:28:33.297 --> 00:28:34.750\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n601\n00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:35.910\nSigning off for ITPRO TV,\n\n602\n00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.045\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery\n>> And i'm Don Pizzette.\n\n603\n00:28:38.045 --> 00:28:38.940\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n604\n00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:48.280\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

First they explain the different disk types. This includes SSD, spinning, USB, and tape. Then they cover the different connectors and data transfer speed for SATA and SAS. Finally they discuss tiering which allows you to use a variety of drives while optimizing storage through policies.",

ProTv.\n\n3\n00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.320\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.850\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with our Cloud Plus series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.700\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nis our mentor, our good friend, Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.630\nDon Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.060\nDonald, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.150\n>> Thanks, happy to be back, Daniel, and\n\n9\n00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.440\nready to jump right back into the world\nof virtualization and Cloud Plus.\n\n10\n00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.890\nIn our last episode,\nwe got a chance to take a look at storage.\n\n11\n00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.390\nAnd we talked a little bit\nabout the storage configuration\n\n12\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.890\nin a virtual environment,\nand SANs in particular.\n\n13\n00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.090\nAnd at the end of the episode, I said hey,\nwe need to do a part two on this.\n\n14\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.866\nWell, as I sat down and looked at it,\nthere were a lot of different things that\n\n15\n00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.327\nI wanted to cover that went well\nbeyond what we could fit in a part 2.\n\n16\n00:00:50.327 --> 00:00:53.300\nSo we're actually gonna just break it\nup over the next couple of episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.960\nIn this episode, we're gonna focus\non the storage media itself.\n\n18\n00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.950\nWhether you have direct attached storage,\nor network attached storage or\n\n19\n00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.410\na storage area network, any of those.\n\n20\n00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.620\nYou're gonna have physical\nhard drives in them and\n\n21\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.080\nthe drives that you select are important\nfor several different reasons.\n\n22\n00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.860\nSo we're gonna talk a little bit about the\ndifferent drives that are available out\n\n23\n00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.250\nthere, and some of the things we\njust need to be concerned with.\n\n24\n00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.420\n>> Well I'm very impressed with Don's\nability to skirt the fact that's\n\n25\n00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.795\nhe's just very verbose [LAUGH].\n\n26\n00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:22.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well we were gonna do a part two, but\n\n27\n00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.429\n[SOUND] this is really another episode.\n\n28\n00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:25.620\n>> I can't stop talking.\n\n29\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.760\n>> That's right, but the good thing is\nthat Don's verbosity is our benefit right?\n\n30\n00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.480\nBecause he's got a lot\nof good information.\n\n31\n00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.480\nAnd knowing how these disks work is going\nto be something that will benefit you\n\n32\n00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.900\nas someone who has to\nsupport a storage device.\n\n33\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.980\nSo Don, let's just jump right in with both\nfeet into the different types of storage.\n\n34\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.720\n>> All right, so\nwhen you buy a storage appliance, and\n\n35\n00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.340\nreally it's going to be anything\nwhether it's a true SAN or\n\n36\n00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.950\nwhether it's the cheapest\nnaz out there on the street.\n\n37\n00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.860\nYou're gonna have some choices\nyou're gonna have to make as far as\n\n38\n00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.390\nthe drives that go inside of it.\n\n39\n00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.080\nAnd you've gotta be really careful.\n\n40\n00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.840\nYou could go on Amazon, or\nNew Egg or somewhere like that and\n\n41\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.500\nbuy the cheapest drives you can find.\n\n42\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.230\nBut not all drives are created equal.\n\n43\n00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.750\nYou'll find that in a storage appliance,\nin a SAN or\n\n44\n00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.760\na NAS, the hard drives\nare spinning 24 hours a day,\n\n45\n00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.630\n7 days a weeks, 365 days a year, most\nhard drives aren't designed to do that.\n\n46\n00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.770\nMost of them are designed for laptops and\ndesktops, where they spin for\n\n47\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.980\na while while you're using the machine,\nand then you turn the machine off and\n\n48\n00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.890\nthey're at rest, constantly being turned\non and off, on and off, and over time,\n\n49\n00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.470\nthey're designed to handle that so\nthey're okay with it, it's no big deal,\n\n50\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.520\neven on a desktop that you leave on all\nthe time, your computer goes to sleep or\n\n51\n00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.350\nthe hard drives themselves\nwill power down to save power.\n\n52\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.360\nAnd that's what they're designed for,\nnot running 24 7.\n\n53\n00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.000\nBut in a SAN you need that\nstorage available all the time,\n\n54\n00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.040\nbecause if the storage goes offline,\nwhat happens to your virtual machines?\n\n55\n00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.910\nThey go offline and\nyou don't want that, right.\n\n56\n00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.500\nWe need reliable storage.\n\n57\n00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.270\nAnd I'll tell you guys a story, it's a\nstory you can hear pretty much anybody who\n\n58\n00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.690\nhas worked on SANs I always, I shudder,\n\n59\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.340\nI cringe any time somebody says, hey we\nneed to turn the SAN off for a minutes.\n\n60\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.140\nAnd I always tell you don't wanna do that.\n\n61\n00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.470\nYou don't wanna turn your SAN off.\n\n62\n00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.380\nYou might be able to reboot it.\n\n63\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.260\nBut usually, you never have to turn things\noff even when you do firmware updates,\n\n64\n00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.730\nyou rarely have to reboot them.\n\n65\n00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.200\nSo if anybody tells me they\nwanna turn their SAN off,\n\n66\n00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.750\nI always tell them okay well\nyou need to buy at least\n\n67\n00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.400\nthree more hard drives before\nyou turn it off all right?\n\n68\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.100\nBecause if you have\nan array even a small one,\n\n69\n00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.660\nyou might have 15 hard drives, if\nthey've been spinning 24 hours a day for\n\n70\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.250\nyears then what's gonna happen is\nthose drives are gonna power down.\n\n71\n00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.550\nAnd when they go to power back up, their\nmotor has been running at a consistent\n\n72\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.370\nspeed that whole time, for\na spinning disk, and then you try and\n\n73\n00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.340\npower back up, and\nthe motor can't kick back in.\n\n74\n00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.540\nIt was fine while it was running,\nbut once you stop, it doesn't run,\n\n75\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.835\nand you have drive fail.\n\n76\n00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:50.945\nIt is a rare,\nrare day that I've turned off a and\n\n77\n00:03:50.945 --> 00:03:52.255\nnot had at least one hard drive fail.\n\n78\n00:03:53.845 --> 00:03:56.875\nAnd no matter what you've done in\nterms of ray to rays and redundancy,\n\n79\n00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:59.215\nthat always throws a wrench into things\nand you've got to plan around it.\n\n80\n00:03:59.215 --> 00:04:00.845\nSo you've got to be careful with it.\n\n81\n00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:05.125\nSo there's a few different solutions to\nthat and there's higher quality drives,\n\n82\n00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:07.500\nthere's drives that are made\nto run in SANS, and\n\n83\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.560\nthen, there's also solid state digital,\n\n84\n00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.650\nwhere you don't have a lot of problems\nthat we have with traditional drives.\n\n85\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.060\nSo let's talk about that real quick,\nthe difference between a spinning disk and\n\n86\n00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.280\nan SSD, or a solid state digital disk.\n\n87\n00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.710\nNow, the traditional storage media\nthat's out there is the spinning disk.\n\n88\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.700\nIt's what we've been using in\ncomputers since the 1908's.\n\n89\n00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.580\nMaybe even the 70s.\n\n90\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.660\nThe first one I owned was actually\nin the early 90s, so it depends.\n\n91\n00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.750\nBut it's been at least the last 30\nyears that they've been around, and\n\n92\n00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.380\nthey work by having a platter that\nspins around like a record or a CD.\n\n93\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.940\nIt spins in a circle, and\nthere's a magnetic arm that reads it.\n\n94\n00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.810\nIf you've never seen one, I've actually\ngot one sitting right here beside me\n\n95\n00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.310\nthat we can pop open and\ntake a look at on the inside.\n\n96\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.182\nSo I've got a traditional spinning disk\nright here on the podium with me and\n\n97\n00:04:50.182 --> 00:04:51.425\nyou'll see I labeled BAD #1.\n\n98\n00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:55.249\nThis is that three terabyte drive that\nwe actually pulled out of one of our Nas\n\n99\n00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.270\nboxes here that had failed, and we're\nbasically just gonna pop the cover off.\n\n100\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.080\nNow, when you pop the cover off,\nyou void the warranty, the disk is ruined,\n\n101\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.980\nbecause inside of it, it's basically\nairtight, because even the smallest amount\n\n102\n00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.260\nof dust that gets inside one of\nthese things can damage the head.\n\n103\n00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.380\nBut on the inside of it,\nif we just pop that cover off,\n\n104\n00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.400\nwhat you're gonna see is that you've\ngot platters over here, right?\n\n105\n00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.230\nAnd I say platters,\nit's hard to see on the camera,\n\n106\n00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.820\nbut there's actually it looks like four.\n\n107\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.330\nMaybe three,\nthree platters inside of this one.\n\n108\n00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.250\nSo it's a three terabyte drive.\n\n109\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.380\nIt's got one terabyte of storage\non each of these platters.\n\n110\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.680\nAnd the platters just spin in a circle.\n\n111\n00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.470\nThis is a,\njust a spindle right here in the middle.\n\n112\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.570\nAnd it's got a motor\nthat causes this to spin.\n\n113\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.000\nAnd then up here,\n\n114\n00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.270\nwe have the arms that have little\nmagnetic reader writers on them, right?\n\n115\n00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.490\nSo these arms move out over the disk.\n\n116\n00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.500\nAnd, did I park it, there we go.\n\n117\n00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.790\nSo there, so it moves out.\n\n118\n00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.250\nI'm completely ruining this.\n\n119\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.890\nI guess it was already bad,\nso it doesn't matter.\n\n120\n00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.490\nBut this arm moves out and\nat the very tip, is a very,\n\n121\n00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.390\nvery tiny magnetic reader and writer.\n\n122\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.950\nAnd so it can read the ones and\nzeros that are off that disk.\n\n123\n00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.210\nAnd this magnetic arm has to move back and\nforth.\n\n124\n00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.300\nIt's got a motor arm.\n\n125\n00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.110\nAlso.\n\n126\n00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.760\nSo in a hard drive,\nyou actually have two motors.\n\n127\n00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.410\nThe one that causes the center\nspindle to spin which I've now seized.\n\n128\n00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.160\nThere we go.\n\n129\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.350\nSo that can spin and\n\n130\n00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.070\nthen we've got another motor that\nmoves the arm back and forth.\n\n131\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.900\nThese are moving parts.\n\n132\n00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.560\nAnd anytime you have moving\nparts inside of a server,\n\n133\n00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.760\nthose are the most likely to fail,\nyour fans and your hard drives.\n\n134\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.620\nNow, solid state parts can fail also like\nin a power supply, CPU, RAM, and so on.\n\n135\n00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.510\nBut it's far less likely.\n\n136\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.590\nBut anything that has moving parts can and\ntypically will fail.\n\n137\n00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:41.890\nThat's why when you buy a hard drive,\n\n138\n00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.100\nit's rare to find a hard drive with\nmore than a three year warranty.\n\n139\n00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.220\nBecause they know after three years,\nthat thing's been running,\n\n140\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.850\nit's been spinning,\nit's likely going to fail.\n\n141\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.420\nSo when you go to Western Digital or\nC Gate or any of the other\n\n142\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.545\nmanufacturers out there that make hard\ndrives, they usually have special drives.\n\n143\n00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:03.425\nThat are designed for storage,\nversus hard drives are just designed for\n\n144\n00:07:03.425 --> 00:07:04.425\ndesk tops and laptops.\n\n145\n00:07:04.425 --> 00:07:06.435\nSo like Western Digital, for example.\n\n146\n00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:07.975\nThey've got various colors.\n\n147\n00:07:07.975 --> 00:07:11.165\nSo the Western Digital green drives\nare designed to be energy efficient and\n\n148\n00:07:11.165 --> 00:07:12.405\nperfect for desktops.\n\n149\n00:07:12.405 --> 00:07:17.435\nBut Western Digital red drives,\nthose are designed for SANS and NAZ.\n\n150\n00:07:17.435 --> 00:07:20.205\nWhere you're gonna have\nthem online all the time.\n\n151\n00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:21.580\nThey're designed for that.\n\n152\n00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.260\nTo be able to survive it, alright?\n\n153\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.540\nBut when you shut these drives down,\nif those motors have started to fail,\n\n154\n00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.010\nthey might have been able to maintain\nspeed, but once they power down,\n\n155\n00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.330\nthey can't come back up and\nthat increases their odds of failure.\n\n156\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.300\nSo a lot of data centers\nare moving away from that.\n\n157\n00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.840\nMoving away from spinning disk and moving\nover to SSD, to solid state digital.\n\n158\n00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.040\nSSD is significantly faster because\nit works the same way that RAM does,\n\n159\n00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.040\nit has flash memory inside of it.\n\n160\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.870\nAnd so when you want to read from\na sector you don't have to move ahead and\n\n161\n00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.045\nhave the disk spin to\na particular to their place,\n\n162\n00:07:53.045 --> 00:07:55.725\nyou can just jump right to that memory\naddress to get the data that you want.\n\n163\n00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.705\nSo reads are very, very fast.\n\n164\n00:07:57.705 --> 00:07:59.101\nAnd writes are pretty quick, too.\n\n165\n00:07:59.101 --> 00:08:02.213\nYou're still writing data into memory,\njust like you'd be writing to a disk, but\n\n166\n00:08:02.213 --> 00:08:05.260\nyou don't have that seek time where\nyou've gotta find it on the drive.\n\n167\n00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.760\nSo SSD is a lot better, right.\n\n168\n00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.690\nBut you may or\nmay not want SSD In your environment.\n\n169\n00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.650\nAnd I know this is a tough one,\npeople say well if it's better,\n\n170\n00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.690\nwhy wouldn't I just go all SSD, all right?\n\n171\n00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.320\nWell there's really\nthree reasons with SSD.\n\n172\n00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.410\nThe first one is the most\nimportant one and that's cost.\n\n173\n00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.650\nSolid state digital drives\nare more expensive, so\n\n174\n00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.550\nyour sand will be more expensive.\n\n175\n00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.680\nAll right.\nNow, that's quickly correcting itself.\n\n176\n00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.840\nWe're starting to see the prices of\nSSDs come down, but as of today,\n\n177\n00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.240\nSSD is still more expensive,\nso there's cost.\n\n178\n00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.880\nThe second one is heat.\n\n179\n00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.730\nSSD drives put out more heat than\ntraditional spinning discs or\n\n180\n00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.640\nmost spinning discs.\n\n181\n00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.650\nSome are pretty bad.\n\n182\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.750\nBut SSDs are hotter.\n\n183\n00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.400\nWe don't normally notice\nthat like in a laptop or\n\n184\n00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.500\na desktop you don't notice it cuz\nyou got one SSD and that's it.\n\n185\n00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.300\nBut if you have 200 SSDs in a rack\nall lined up, cuz there nice and\n\n186\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.690\nsmall, you can fit them in like that,\nyou actually generate a good bit of heat.\n\n187\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:59.100\nAnd so that becomes a little bit\nproblematic in high density environments.\n\n188\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.190\nAnd then the third reason you\nmight not want to go with SSDs\n\n189\n00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.520\nit that they wear out, right?\n\n190\n00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.430\nAnd they can wear out In some\nscenarios faster than spinning disks.\n\n191\n00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.550\nWith a spinning disk I can read and write\nto the same sector as many times as I want\n\n192\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.430\nas long as that platter doesn't become\ncontaminated, I can keep reading and\n\n193\n00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.858\nwriting to it and I won't have a failure.\n\n194\n00:09:15.858 --> 00:09:20.940\nBut on SSD you can only read and\nwrite to the same area so\n\n195\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.940\nmany times before it wears out and is no\nlonger able to be written to and when that\n\n196\n00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.000\nhappens you start having unreliable\nreads and that sector is now bad.\n\n197\n00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.890\nAnd so operating systems have to use\nthings like trim and other technologies to\n\n198\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.120\nmake sure that they don't constantly\nwrite to the same sector on those SSDs.\n\n199\n00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.150\nNow I'll tell you guys,\nthe failure rate, I mean you have to\n\n200\n00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.160\nwrite to the same sector millions\nof times and so it's a lot.\n\n201\n00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.960\nAnd on a standard desktop, it'll be five,\neven seven, years before you hit that.\n\n202\n00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.030\nSo on a standard desktop I don't\neven worry about it any more.\n\n203\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.430\nIt's just not even something\nI really care about.\n\n204\n00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:56.397\nBut in a sand, where maybe you've got\na heavy transactional data base on there,\n\n205\n00:09:56.397 --> 00:10:00.123\nyou might be reading and writing for\nthat same sector a lot and\n\n206\n00:10:00.123 --> 00:10:01.820\nthat drive can die sooner.\n\n207\n00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.220\nSo you might have a shorter\nlifetime with SSDs.\n\n208\n00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.480\nThey're more expensive and\nhave a shorter lifetime,\n\n209\n00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.430\nthat means you're replacing them more\noften which, again, increases that cost.\n\n210\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.500\nSo definitely something to\nbe concerned about, but\n\n211\n00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.270\nthat's the negative side of SSDs.\n\n212\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.860\nBut in every other aspect,\n\n213\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.650\nthey are better, they're faster,\nthey work really well, you pop them in,\n\n214\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.480\nthey're smaller, they take less space,\nthere's no moving parts, so\n\n215\n00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.100\ntheir fail rate is lower, and they're\njust all around a great technology.\n\n216\n00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.930\nI have no doubt, five years from\nnow it'll be SSD everywhere.\n\n217\n00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.470\nThese spinning disks will be,\n\n218\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.330\nI'll talk about these the same way we\ntalk about floppy disks right now.\n\n219\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.540\nRight?\nThat's where we'll be five years from now.\n\n220\n00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:41.530\nBut today when you go into\na virtualized environment, you'll still\n\n221\n00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.920\nsee spinning disks because if they're\nlower cost, we can get more of them.\n\n222\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.960\nAnd the more disks you have\nthe better your performance is.\n\n223\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.880\nWe'll talk more about raid\nlevels in another episode.\n\n224\n00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.750\nBut with most types of raid,\n\n225\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.030\nthe more disks you have\nthe better your performance is.\n\n226\n00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.950\nAnd we can get more spinning\ndisks that are larger in size\n\n227\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.780\nthen SSD drives that are more\nexpensive and smaller in size.\n\n228\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.230\nSo right now, you can get a terabyte\nSSD drive pretty easy but\n\n229\n00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.410\nI can get an 8 terabyte traditional\nspinning drive pretty easy.\n\n230\n00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.640\nSo I can get a higher amount\nof storage with more disks and\n\n231\n00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.610\nend up spending less money.\n\n232\n00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.170\nSo you still see both that\nare out there in play.\n\n233\n00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.040\nSSD versus spinning.\n\n234\n00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.450\nAnd those aren't the only disk types\nthat we're gonna see that are out there,\n\n235\n00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.040\nyou might have USB storage,\nideally you won't.\n\n236\n00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.710\nIn a network attached storage\ndevice you might have USB,\n\n237\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:35.360\nin a true SAN you won't have USB\nused anywhere because USB is slow.\n\n238\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.220\nIf you look at USB1, 2 and\neven, 3 USB 3 speeds are fast,\n\n239\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.060\ndon't get me wrong, but they're not\nat the speeds of internal drives, and\n\n240\n00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.390\nso that type of technology,\nwe don't see that much.\n\n241\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.310\nYou do still see tape drives though.\n\n242\n00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:54.000\nIf you have a SAN, you need to back it up,\nand a lot of SANs do support having\n\n243\n00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.440\nphysical tape drives directly\nattached to the SAN and\n\n244\n00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.560\nthey can manage their own backups,\npretty neat stuff.\n\n245\n00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.700\nYou combine that with a tape robot,\nthat's rotating the tapes out for you, and\n\n246\n00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.645\nyou can have automated backups\nrunning right there from SAN.\n\n247\n00:12:04.645 --> 00:12:06.700\nNow most people have kind of\nmoved away from tape backup, and\n\n248\n00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.550\nare instead backing up\nto other hard drives.\n\n249\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.530\nBack in the day,\ntapes used to save us a lot of money that\n\n250\n00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.630\nyou could back up the tape, and\nyou didn't have to buy extra hard drives.\n\n251\n00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.610\nBut these days, hard drives cost\nthe same as tapes, it seems, and\n\n252\n00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.740\nso you end up kind of going that route,\nand we don't see it as much anymore.\n\n253\n00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.480\nAll right, but back to the drives,\nlet's talk about those drives.\n\n254\n00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.280\nI mentioned that we're still\ngonna see spinning disks, but\n\n255\n00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.390\nwe're also gonna see SSDs.\n\n256\n00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.640\nAnd regardless of which\ntechnology we go with,\n\n257\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.340\nthere's two primary connectors that\nyou're gonna see on SANS today.\n\n258\n00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.210\nThere's SATA drives and\nSAS drives, all right?\n\n259\n00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.234\nSATA is the serial attached ATA, right?\n\n260\n00:12:43.234 --> 00:12:44.226\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know,\n\n261\n00:12:44.226 --> 00:12:45.870\nwe're gonna use the acronym\nin this definition.\n\n262\n00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:48.150\nI always forget what that stands for.\n\n263\n00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.650\nIt's like serial AT attachment I\nthink is what it stands for, and\n\n264\n00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.180\nAT refers to the old AT style computers.\n\n265\n00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.170\nI don't know that AT actually stands for\nanything.\n\n266\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:01.080\nBut serial ATA,\nthat's the one that you see in desktops,\n\n267\n00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.280\nlaptops, and servers, right?\n\n268\n00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.800\nIt's very, very common,\nand it's fairly low cost.\n\n269\n00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.900\nAnd then SAS, that's Serial Attached SCSI,\n\n270\n00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:15.740\nthis is a newer form of SCSI drive\nthat uses a serial-based connection.\n\n271\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.170\nAnd these drives are fast and\nthey're really designed for servers.\n\n272\n00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.770\nWe'll see them in server-based\nenvironments because we're gonna have\n\n273\n00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.830\na higher density of them and\nthere's a few other benefits to it.\n\n274\n00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.630\nSo when you go to buy a SAN,\n\n275\n00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.330\nyou got really four choices\nthat you're gonna have to make.\n\n276\n00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.770\nDo I do SETA or SASS?\n\n277\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.400\nDo I do spinning disc or SSD?\n\n278\n00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.580\nAnd you can actually mix and match.\n\n279\n00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.870\nI'll show you guys an example of that\na little bit later where we can mix and\n\n280\n00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.800\nmatch and do what's called data tiering.\n\n281\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.830\nData tiering is where you have some\nstorage that's really expensive,\n\n282\n00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:51.640\nreally high end storage, and some storage\nthat's cheap and low cost, right.\n\n283\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:57.380\nSo for example,\nwhen you go to buy a SAS disk, right.\n\n284\n00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.090\nIn fact,\nhere let's have a little fun here.\n\n285\n00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:04.004\nI'm gonna jump over to,\nwho do we want to shop with today Daniel?\n\n286\n00:14:04.004 --> 00:14:07.880\n>> Let's see, Newegg is usually a good\n>> Good old Newegg, all right so\n\n287\n00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.470\nwe'll jump over to Newegg and\n\n288\n00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:14.461\nlet's say that I want to buy some hard\ndrives or Deadpool figurines, right?\n\n289\n00:14:14.461 --> 00:14:16.702\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I wanna look for\n\n290\n00:14:16.702 --> 00:14:21.698\na, actually here let's go this way,\ncomponents and hard drives, and\n\n291\n00:14:21.698 --> 00:14:24.945\nwhen I jump into hard\ndrives it's asking me for\n\n292\n00:14:24.945 --> 00:14:28.962\nmy various choices here,\nwhat do I want, SSDs and so on.\n\n293\n00:14:28.962 --> 00:14:32.550\nLet's see,\ndo they have a special area for servers?\n\n294\n00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.080\nThey really don't, so we'll just\ngo Desktop Internal Hard Drives.\n\n295\n00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.880\nAll right, so when I go to pick my\ninternal hard drives over here on the left\n\n296\n00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.060\nside it's giving me things to filter by\nand I see my brands, Western Digital,\n\n297\n00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.060\nSeagate, the other guys,\nSATA versus SAS right here.\n\n298\n00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:53.290\nAnd notice how they're showing SATA 3.0Gb,\nSATA 6.0Gb, SAS 6.0Gb, SAS 12.0Gb.\n\n299\n00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.420\nThere's different speeds of these drives.\n\n300\n00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.420\nAnd so when I go shopping for my disk,\n\n301\n00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.280\nI've got to pick based on what my needs\nare and some can be really expensive.\n\n302\n00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.560\nLet's compare, for example,\nthat SAS drive at 12 gigs, right?\n\n303\n00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.550\nSo, I'm gonna find a 12 gig SAS drive.\n\n304\n00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:13.140\nAnd just looking at the prices over here,\nwe've got a 12 gig SAS\n\n305\n00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:17.495\ndrive that is 2 TB that's about $200,\nthat's kind of cheap, isn't it?\n\n306\n00:15:17.495 --> 00:15:18.180\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n307\n00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:24.790\n>> We've got a couple of others, $350,\n$900, you saw $1000 up here for this one.\n\n308\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.630\nAnd why such a big price difference,\nright?\n\n309\n00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:33.620\nWhy is this Seagate drive right here\n$359 but this one up here is $1165?\n\n310\n00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.890\nThis one is 6 TB,\nthis one is only 600 gigs.\n\n311\n00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.070\nWhat's the difference?\n\n312\n00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:44.060\nAll right, well when you shop for a drive,\nyou're gonna see this guy right here.\n\n313\n00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.350\nThis is a 7200 rpm disk.\n\n314\n00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:51.990\nThat means the platter can spin\n7,200 times per minute, right?\n\n315\n00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.455\nAnd that's pretty fast,\nthat's a lot of spins.\n\n316\n00:15:55.455 --> 00:16:00.710\nConsidering like an old record that's a 45\nwhich been 45 time per minute, right?\n\n317\n00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.255\nThis is spinning 7,200\ntimes per minute But\n\n318\n00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:08.510\nif you look at the drive up here,\nit's 15,000 RPM.\n\n319\n00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:12.530\nIt's spinning over twice as\nfast as the drive down here.\n\n320\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.930\nAnd if it can spin twice as fast,\nit's sync time is gonna be reduced by 50%.\n\n321\n00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:22.150\nIt's gonna be a significantly faster\ndrive because of that, all right?\n\n322\n00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.000\nSo definitely quicker\non it's access there.\n\n323\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.330\nThere's other benefits to it.\n\n324\n00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:31.780\nLike this is a HP Enterprise drive so it's\ndesigned to be running 24 hours a day.\n\n325\n00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.410\nThe Seagate one it says\nenterprise drive also.\n\n326\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.610\nSo it may or may not be designed for that.\n\n327\n00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.880\nThis one tells me that\nits got a 128MB of cache.\n\n328\n00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.300\nI don't know how much cache this on has\nbut I hope it's a lot for that price.\n\n329\n00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.550\nBut you'll find that there's\nvary differences on quality and\n\n330\n00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.910\nI should throw this little caveat out.\n\n331\n00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.390\nDepending on the SAN you buy, you might\nnot be able to just go to the store and\n\n332\n00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.140\nbuy drives like this, all right?\n\n333\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.270\nSo for example we have a Dell\nEqualLogic SAN here in the building.\n\n334\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.740\nAnd with that EqualLogic SAN,\nif we buy our own drives and\n\n335\n00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.210\nput it in there,\nDell won't honor the warranty any more.\n\n336\n00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.150\nWe have to buy the drives from Dell.\n\n337\n00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.220\nEven if we go out and\nbuy the exact same drives that Dell sells,\n\n338\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.400\nDell puts their signature in\nthe firmware of their drive.\n\n339\n00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.080\nSo they know if it's one\nthat came from them or\n\n340\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.580\nnot, and you've gotta use theirs or\nyou void the warranty.\n\n341\n00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.420\nSo I know I can go out and\n\n342\n00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.160\nget a drive for $200, but\nI've gotta buy it from them for $600.\n\n343\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.080\nAnd the deal there is that\nthey've certified the drive,\n\n344\n00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.910\nthey show that it works in their\nsystem and honor their warranty.\n\n345\n00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.630\nAnd they're making a ton of money on it.\n\n346\n00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.752\nIt's really kind of the bottom line.\n\n347\n00:17:33.752 --> 00:17:37.441\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, people gotta make their money,\n\n348\n00:17:37.441 --> 00:17:38.320\nI guess.\n\n349\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.860\nBut be aware that as you shop for\n\n350\n00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.810\nthe discs, also be aware that there\nare those different levels of drives.\n\n351\n00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:48.020\nSo for example, if I,\nlet me just do like a Western Digital,\n\n352\n00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.880\nI mentioned Western Digital\ngreen drives earlier.\n\n353\n00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.440\nAnd so if I look for\na Western Digital green drive\n\n354\n00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.280\nthese are the ones that are designed for\npower efficiency.\n\n355\n00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.300\nSo they'll power down when\nthey're not in use and so on.\n\n356\n00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.150\nThat's what they do, they're designed\nreally to be great for desktops and\n\n357\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:03.940\nother areas.\n\n358\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.710\nI use them at home where, like right now\nmy desktop at home is just sitting there\n\n359\n00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.340\nand so I have Western Digital green drives\nin there and they'll power down and\n\n360\n00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.170\ngo to sleep and save a little power\nin the last a little longer for it.\n\n361\n00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.510\nBut if we look for\nlike Western Digital red drives.\n\n362\n00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.860\nRed drives are ones that we use\nhere in our storage appliances.\n\n363\n00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:25.545\nHere's Western Digital red and these are\nthe ones designed to run 24 hours a day\n\n364\n00:18:25.545 --> 00:18:28.995\nall year long and\nbe able to support that environment.\n\n365\n00:18:28.995 --> 00:18:32.605\nYou'll notice the price is not much\ndifferent between these, right?\n\n366\n00:18:32.605 --> 00:18:34.455\nThe big difference is just\nwhat they're designed to do.\n\n367\n00:18:34.455 --> 00:18:37.185\nYou gotta buy the right drive for\nthe solution, so.\n\n368\n00:18:37.185 --> 00:18:39.985\n>> So even though this is a really\ncool drive, you wouldn't buy this and\n\n369\n00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:43.035\nstick it in your home computer,\nbecause that's not what it's intended for.\n\n370\n00:18:43.035 --> 00:18:45.365\n>> Right, and in fact you might even\nget worse performance out of it,\n\n371\n00:18:45.365 --> 00:18:48.455\nbecause on my home computer I might be,\nlike if you're a person who shuts it down\n\n372\n00:18:48.455 --> 00:18:50.490\nevery night\n>> You're turning that drive on and\n\n373\n00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.110\noff, on and off, on and off.\n\n374\n00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.170\nIt's not designed for that,\nit's designed to be run 24/7,\n\n375\n00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.260\nversus the green drive that\nis designed to go on and off.\n\n376\n00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.650\nSo, you got to make sure you get the right\none for the solution that is important.\n\n377\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.110\nLets talk a little bit about SAS and\nSATA and the connectors and\n\n378\n00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.220\nkind of how they work.\n\n379\n00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.420\nSo, I have a little diagram here,\nwell a couple of pictures and\n\n380\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.130\nwhat I wanted to do is familiarize you\nguys with these two different standards,\n\n381\n00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.150\nSAS and SATA,\ncuz you're gonna see them a lot.\n\n382\n00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.610\nWhether you've got solid state drives or\nwhether you've got spinning drives,\n\n383\n00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.250\nthey all use these same connectors, right?\n\n384\n00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.900\nSo it's pretty standard out there in\nthe market today and it makes life easy.\n\n385\n00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.860\nYou've only got two connectors.\n\n386\n00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.040\nBut there are different speeds and\ncategories inside of them, all right?\n\n387\n00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.050\nSo let's start with SATA.\n\n388\n00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.570\n>> So with SATA, you've got three\nlevels of SATA right now, SATA I,\n\n389\n00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.810\nSATA II, SATA III.\n\n390\n00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:43.415\nAnd SATA I is the original and\nit started with a 1.5Gb/s transfer rate.\n\n391\n00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:47.205\nAnd the 1.5 gigs was significantly\nfaster than what we have with IED,\n\n392\n00:19:47.205 --> 00:19:49.805\nthe older technology was fast and\npeople wanted it.\n\n393\n00:19:49.805 --> 00:19:53.145\nAnd over time, they've improved that\ntechnology and made it better and\n\n394\n00:19:53.145 --> 00:19:54.635\nbetter and better.\n\n395\n00:19:54.635 --> 00:19:57.115\nSo with SATA,\nwe've got to remember two things.\n\n396\n00:19:57.115 --> 00:19:58.915\nOne, it's faster than\nthe old technologies,\n\n397\n00:19:58.915 --> 00:20:03.135\nand two,\nwith SATA you have one drive per channel.\n\n398\n00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:07.640\nSo if you have a system that uses SATA\ndrives or a SAN that uses SATA drives,\n\n399\n00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.830\nyou'll have one connector for each drive,\nand each one's on its own channel.\n\n400\n00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:16.450\nSo when I say that drive gets 1.5 gigs,\nthat drive actually gets that.\n\n401\n00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.730\nVersus the older buses,\nlike the SCSI buses,\n\n402\n00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.120\nwhere you could have 15\ndrives on the one bus.\n\n403\n00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.650\nWell if that bus was rated for\n320 megabits per second\n\n404\n00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.740\nAll the drives were sharing that and\nso you didn't truly get 320\n\n405\n00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.860\nmegabits per second unless only one drive\nwas communicating at that time, right?\n\n406\n00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:38.030\nI mean you actually did get 320 megabytes\nper second but only one drive could talk\n\n407\n00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.250\nat a time and so you might have been time\nslicing between the different disks and\n\n408\n00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.880\nyou end up getting less at\nthe end of the day, right?\n\n409\n00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.500\nSo these are all dedicated and that's\nhow all these work, that's how SATA and\n\n410\n00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.400\nSAS both work, is one drive per channel.\n\n411\n00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.580\nSo SATA II doubled it to 3 Gb, and\nSATA III doubled that to 6 Gb.\n\n412\n00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.610\nAnd you guys saw on Newegg,\n6 Gb pretty easy to find, and\n\n413\n00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.080\nnot incredibly expensive anymore.\n\n414\n00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.150\nIt used to be, now it's pretty\nrun of the mill, all right?\n\n415\n00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.220\nAt the same time we had serial\nattached SCSI evolving.\n\n416\n00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.880\nAnd you don't use serial attached\nSCSI in regular desktops,\n\n417\n00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.140\nyou use serial attached SCSI in servers,\nthat's really what it's designed for.\n\n418\n00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.810\nAnd it was designed to be more reliable\nand designed to run at higher speeds.\n\n419\n00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:20.319\nSo finding a 15,000 RPM SAS drive is\na lot easier than finding a 15,000\n\n420\n00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:21.242\nRPM SATA drive.\n\n421\n00:21:21.242 --> 00:21:23.888\nRight, they're designed to be\nable to handle that better, and\n\n422\n00:21:23.888 --> 00:21:26.510\nhave a longer mean time before failure.\n\n423\n00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.440\nNow SAS started out at 3 Gb/s.\n\n424\n00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.280\nAnd then we have SAS-2 at 6Gb/s and\nnow we have SAS-3 at 12Gb/s.\n\n425\n00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.520\nSo you can get double the performance\nof SATA III by going with SAS-3.\n\n426\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.980\nSo if you're building a SAN your best\ndrives that you can go out there and\n\n427\n00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:49.050\nget will be your SAS-3 drives if they're\n15,000 RPM, and they're expensive.\n\n428\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.520\nThey're gonna cost you a lot of money.\n\n429\n00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.280\nVersus going with SATA III\ndrives that will be cheaper.\n\n430\n00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.790\nAnd so what a lot of people will do is\nthey'll set up what's called data tiering.\n\n431\n00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.500\nData tiering is where you have\na mixture of the drives and\n\n432\n00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.285\nyou can set up a policy in your SAN\nthat says, hey, write critical data\n\n433\n00:22:06.285 --> 00:22:10.097\nto the high-tier drives and write\nnon-critical data to the low-tier drives.\n\n434\n00:22:10.097 --> 00:22:12.725\nAnd the SAN can actually monitor your\ndata and it can say, you know what,\n\n435\n00:22:12.725 --> 00:22:16.755\nnobody's accessed this file in two years,\nI'm gonna move it over to the SATA disks.\n\n436\n00:22:16.755 --> 00:22:20.605\nAnd they can say, wow, 100 people accessed\nthis one file just in the last hour,\n\n437\n00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:22.785\nlet me move that to the SAS drives.\n\n438\n00:22:22.785 --> 00:22:25.570\nSo you can mix and match and\nreally get some good results.\n\n439\n00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:28.000\nOr if money is no object,\nyou could just get all SAS drives and\n\n440\n00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.730\nthen you're in business.\n\n441\n00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.990\nAll right, so\non the connector side, SAS and\n\n442\n00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.680\nSATA drives actually\nuse the same connector.\n\n443\n00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.980\nThis connector right here.\n\n444\n00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.930\nIt's a little 7-pin connector and\nit's the same.\n\n445\n00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:43.820\nThis one is a SATA cable here, but\nSAS and SATA use the same connector.\n\n446\n00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.050\nThe difference is really on the other end.\n\n447\n00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.790\nSo on a a SATA connector,\nit looks like this and\n\n448\n00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.150\nsee this little notch that's right here?\n\n449\n00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.980\nYou can get a cable that has the SATA and\n\n450\n00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.430\nthe power connector right\nnext to each other, okay?\n\n451\n00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:02.598\nAnd when they're next to each other\nthere's this little notch that\n\n452\n00:23:02.598 --> 00:23:03.442\nseparates them.\n\n453\n00:23:03.442 --> 00:23:07.240\nAnd on a SATA drive, the notch is solid.\n\n454\n00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.020\nThere's a little solid piece of\nplastic right here that says\n\n455\n00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:14.720\nthis is gonna be SATA, but\non a SAS drive, the notch isn't there.\n\n456\n00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.930\nAnd I mean, you have this little post, but\nthen you have a gap and another post, so\n\n457\n00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.090\nthere's a little empty notch.\n\n458\n00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:23.190\nAnd that stops you from plugging\na SAS cable into a SATA connector.\n\n459\n00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.560\nIt stops you from doing that.\n\n460\n00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.570\nThe other way you can actually get that\nconnector on but this way you can't.\n\n461\n00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:32.270\nSo there's that little difference but\notherwise the connectors look the same.\n\n462\n00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.458\nSo, where things get different,\nIt's kinda on that other side.\n\n463\n00:23:35.458 --> 00:23:39.880\nAnd in SAS, we normally expect to\nhave a high port density, and so\n\n464\n00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.740\nyou'll see cables like this.\n\n465\n00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.545\nAnd what you've got here are actually\nfour SAS connectors combined into one\n\n466\n00:23:46.545 --> 00:23:47.606\nbig connector.\n\n467\n00:23:47.606 --> 00:23:51.324\nThis connector would plug into your\nRAID controller or your motherboard and\n\n468\n00:23:51.324 --> 00:23:54.866\nthen it breaks out into four cables\nthat look like regular SATA cables and\n\n469\n00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:57.210\nthose would run to your\nindividual SAS drives.\n\n470\n00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.260\nSo those would run to four SAS drives.\n\n471\n00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:04.245\nI might have, three more of these so\nthat I can support 16 drives total.\n\n472\n00:24:04.245 --> 00:24:06.137\nIf I've got a 15-drive tray,\n\n473\n00:24:06.137 --> 00:24:10.770\nthis is likely what's on the back end\nof it to connect all those drives up.\n\n474\n00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:14.240\nSo the connectors don't really\nlook any different, but\n\n475\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.130\nthe protocol is different and\nthe speeds are different, right?\n\n476\n00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.920\nThis is what you really care about and\nthat reliability.\n\n477\n00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.554\nSo we need to pay attention to what\nlevel of SAS or SATA we're getting and\n\n478\n00:24:24.554 --> 00:24:28.185\nwhat the RPMs are,\nhow fast those disks are spinning and\n\n479\n00:24:28.185 --> 00:24:32.761\nhow quickly we can get at that data\nif we're going with spinning disk.\n\n480\n00:24:32.761 --> 00:24:36.821\nIf we're going with SSD,\nthey still come in SATA and SAS, right.\n\n481\n00:24:36.821 --> 00:24:40.310\nIn my laptop, I've got a SATA SSD drive.\n\n482\n00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.600\nBut in our storage appliance\nover in the server closet,\n\n483\n00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.830\nwe've got SAS drives that are SSD.\n\n484\n00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.590\nSo you can get SSD either way,\nand at that point you're not so\n\n485\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.900\nconcerned about the RPMs, you don't\nhave RPMs in a solid state drive.\n\n486\n00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.540\nYou just go and read right from the sector\nthat you want to read, the memory address.\n\n487\n00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.972\nYou don't bother with moving an arm.\n\n488\n00:24:56.972 --> 00:24:59.172\nBut you do worry about these speeds.\n\n489\n00:24:59.172 --> 00:25:01.820\nYou do have to make sure\nyou get the right ones.\n\n490\n00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.310\nAnd whatever controller you're using,\n\n491\n00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:06.650\nif you have a RAID controller,\nit's gonna match on bandwidth, too.\n\n492\n00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.500\nIf I attach ten six-gig drives to it,\n\n493\n00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:14.270\nI could potentially be transmitting\n60 gigs of data per second, right?\n\n494\n00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.710\nIs my RAID controller able to handle that?\n\n495\n00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.880\nIs the PCI Express bus behind\nit able to handle that?\n\n496\n00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.930\nRemember that, too, because you have\nmultiple levels of PCI Express bus.\n\n497\n00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.960\nNow If you're building your own SAN you\ndon't have to worry about this stuff.\n\n498\n00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.690\nIf you buy a boxed SAN,\nyou buy one from ENC or HP or\n\n499\n00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.710\nwhoever, they've already\nworried about that.\n\n500\n00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:32.690\nThey've built the back\n\n501\n00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.460\nplanes to be able to handle\nthe maximum traffic and throughput.\n\n502\n00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.398\nSo if you have 15 drives and\nit supports 12 gig SAS,\n\n503\n00:25:38.398 --> 00:25:43.132\nit'll have a back plane that supports\nwhatever 15 times 12 is, and\n\n504\n00:25:43.132 --> 00:25:47.060\n[LAUGH] so they'll support that and you'll\nhave that bandwidth on the back end.\n\n505\n00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.100\nSo I think it's what,\nover 180 gigabytes or something.\n\n506\n00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.120\nSo you'll have that access, they've\nplanned for it, they've designed it, and\n\n507\n00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.490\nit's set to cover it, right?\n\n508\n00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.713\nBut these are all considerations we have\nto make when we go to set up one of these\n\n509\n00:25:57.713 --> 00:25:58.662\nSANs and what we need.\n\n510\n00:25:58.662 --> 00:25:59.930\n>> Yeah, Don, quick question.\n\n511\n00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:03.740\nYou were talking about the tiering and\nmy mind was wandering off on about that.\n\n512\n00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.052\nHow does it know, how does the SAN\nknow this is critical data,\n\n513\n00:26:07.052 --> 00:26:11.890\nthis is not as critical data and this low\npriority data so they can do that tiering?\n\n514\n00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.680\n>> So by default,\n\n515\n00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.620\nmost of the devices that do it will\ndo it just based on access, right?\n\n516\n00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.380\nWhat's being accessed frequently,\nwhat's not being accessed frequently.\n\n517\n00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.740\nBut they usually support what's\ncalled a tiering policy.\n\n518\n00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.020\nAnd with the tiering policy, you can go in\nand you can define what you want it to be.\n\n519\n00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.330\nSo, for example,\n\n520\n00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:31.920\nlet's say that you've got a SAN that's\npowered by Windows Storage Spaces, right.\n\n521\n00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.140\nSo you can get an EMC SAN that's\npowered by Windows Storage Spaces.\n\n522\n00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.640\nAnd in Windows Storage Spaces\nyou can write a policy that says\n\n523\n00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.370\nif I tag a document,\nbecause you have document tags,\n\n524\n00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.840\nif I tag a document as top secret,\nright, I want that to be high tier.\n\n525\n00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.280\nBut if I tag it as archive,\nthen put it in low tier.\n\n526\n00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.090\nAnd so you can start tagging your\nown documents with the metadata of\n\n527\n00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.130\nthe documents and the SAN can read\nthat metadata and make a decision.\n\n528\n00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.980\nIt's all based on that.\n\n529\n00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.560\nIt's kind of up to you how\nyou want to set that up and\n\n530\n00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.510\nif you want those resources in there.\n\n531\n00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.710\nI'm trying to double check real quick and\nsee if I can show you guys this.\n\n532\n00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.410\nI've got a little EMC SAN pulled up here.\n\n533\n00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:12.087\nLet me show you guys.\n\n534\n00:27:12.087 --> 00:27:12.887\nWe can see it.\n\n535\n00:27:12.887 --> 00:27:14.567\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm confident that we can see this.\n\n536\n00:27:14.567 --> 00:27:19.470\nSo, in this SAN, we've actually got\na mixture of SAS and SATA discs.\n\n537\n00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.600\nSo we've got tiered storage,\n\n538\n00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.290\ndifferent levels of discs kind\nof buried inside of this thing.\n\n539\n00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.920\nSo if I go up into my storage, and\ninside of storage I'm gonna down into\n\n540\n00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.970\nmy storage configuration,\nI'm gonna go into my storage pools.\n\n541\n00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:37.050\nSo, right here inside of my storage\npool I've got a pool that's just called\n\n542\n00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:40.110\nMultiTier and\nyou see it's got 10 TB of space.\n\n543\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.702\nI'm currently using 1 TB of it.\n\n544\n00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:47.980\nSo, this is my kinda storage as\nI've got it right now, all right?\n\n545\n00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.960\nAnd if I pull up its details,\nlet's get into that.\n\n546\n00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.690\nSo here's my multitier pool details,\nand I go into Disks.\n\n547\n00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.400\nHere's my disks, okay?\n\n548\n00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.080\nAnd looking as the disks,\nactually, I lied, didn't I?\n\n549\n00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.150\nIt's all SAS on this one.\n\n550\n00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:07.670\nSo we've got some disks in here,\njust different levels of disks, though.\n\n551\n00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:11.730\nSome are higher quality than others, but\nbasically we've got these SAS disks right\n\n552\n00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:16.710\nacross, and notice how some of them\nare 1.8 terabyte and some are 820 gigs,\n\n553\n00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.590\nso just different kind of\nlevels of quality disk.\n\n554\n00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.540\nAnd here's the difference, I knew\nthere was a difference of some sort.\n\n555\n00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.930\nThe top ones are 7,200 RPM,\nthe bottom ones are 10,000 RPM, so\n\n556\n00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.610\nI've got slower and faster disks.\n\n557\n00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:33.130\nAnd so I want critical data to be\non these faster disks down here.\n\n558\n00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.210\nAnd I want non-critical data to\nbe on these slower disks up here.\n\n559\n00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.320\nNow, if I just leave\nit at the defaults and\n\n560\n00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.110\nEMC SAN is actually set to just\nmonitor for data activity.\n\n561\n00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.300\nAnd so, if it's frequently accessed data\nit'll try and transition it down to these\n\n562\n00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.260\ndisks and if it's infrequently accessed\ndata it'll move it up to these disks and\n\n563\n00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.480\nit can move and react based on our needs.\n\n564\n00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:55.230\nOr I can go up here to\nwhat's called FAST VP.\n\n565\n00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.430\nNow, that's just EMC's name, right, so\n\n566\n00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.420\nyour software may have\na completely different name.\n\n567\n00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.870\nMicrosoft actually calls\nthem storage tier policies.\n\n568\n00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:06.430\nAnyhow, they all have different names for\nit, but at the end of the day,\n\n569\n00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:07.630\nit's just a policy.\n\n570\n00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:12.440\nAnd you come in here, and you define how\nyou want that relocation to occur and\n\n571\n00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.380\nwhat those categories are.\n\n572\n00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.930\nAnd so notice down here we've got this\nperformance tier and capacity tier.\n\n573\n00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:22.180\nPerformance tier,\nthat's the high speed, the good stuff.\n\n574\n00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.800\nCapacity tier, that's the low side.\n\n575\n00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.930\nAnd we set how much data we\nwant to allow it to move.\n\n576\n00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.090\nAnd actually, it looks like I've got\nit disabled right now which just\n\n577\n00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:30.910\nkind of defeats the whole purpose.\n\n578\n00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:35.565\nBut you can set how many gigs you want to\nmove over to one side versus the other and\n\n579\n00:29:35.565 --> 00:29:40.120\nkinda allocate that and\nhow closely you want to rebalance and\n\n580\n00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:40.980\nhow much space you've got.\n\n581\n00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.130\nYou can see all of that\nlaid out right here.\n\n582\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:48.700\nAnd if you look at mine, notice how my\nperformance tier has 1.2 terabytes used.\n\n583\n00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.060\nI've got 2 terabytes free.\n\n584\n00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.260\nMy lower tier isn't used at all.\n\n585\n00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.880\nIt's gonna write everything to the high\nperformance tier until it's full and\n\n586\n00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.480\nthen it has to start making decisions,\nright?\n\n587\n00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.410\nWhy leave that empty if\nyou've got it available?\n\n588\n00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.100\nSo it is doing that, so\nI'm not completely disabled here.\n\n589\n00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.750\nBut it's got it in place.\n\n590\n00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.670\nAnd you can come up here and dictate how\nyou want those reallocations to happen.\n\n591\n00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:09.420\nDo you want it to happen on a schedule so\n\n592\n00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.560\nevery night at midnight\nmove things around?\n\n593\n00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.640\nOr do you want to have\nit happen all the time?\n\n594\n00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.680\nIt's a better idea to put it after hours\nso you don't affect people's performance\n\n595\n00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.150\nwhile you're moving files around, but you\nmight wanna go a little more frequently.\n\n596\n00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:24.270\nAnd so you can jump into this and\nreally tweak these settings and\n\n597\n00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.220\ncustomize quite a bit.\n\n598\n00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.680\nSo here you can see mine's scheduled\nto happen at, it looks like\n\n599\n00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.990\nin between 5 PM and 1 AM, it's gonna go\nthrough and start reallocating that data.\n\n600\n00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:36.640\nSo depending on the saying you choose\nit'll likely have something like this for\n\n601\n00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.070\ndefining a data tier.\n\n602\n00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.803\nAnd you might have SSD disks for\nyour performance tier and then SAS or\n\n603\n00:30:41.803 --> 00:30:44.890\neven SATA disks for\nyour non-performance tier.\n\n604\n00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.487\nAnd that way if you have stuff\nthat's just not being used,\n\n605\n00:30:47.487 --> 00:30:49.882\nmove it off to cheap storage\nthat you can have a ton of.\n\n606\n00:30:49.882 --> 00:30:52.832\nBut your frequently accessed stuff\ngoes on really fast and your users,\n\n607\n00:30:52.832 --> 00:30:54.940\nwhen they access the SAN,\nthey think it's blazing fast.\n\n608\n00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.980\nAs far as they know,\nthe whole thing is SSD SAS drives, right?\n\n609\n00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.680\nThey don't know that there's\narchive drives that are cheap and\n\n610\n00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.770\ncrappy that we have our old data\non that we don't care about.\n\n611\n00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.970\nAnd the SAN is taking care of reallocating\nall that for us, really cool stuff.\n\n612\n00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:10.440\n>> It is very cool stuff.\n\n613\n00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.995\nAnd as you can see, when you're\nworking with a SAN, it's not just, let\n\n614\n00:31:13.995 --> 00:31:17.774\nme grab some disks and throw it in a box\nand connect it through a fiber channel.\n\n615\n00:31:17.774 --> 00:31:18.404\nThat was easy.\n\n616\n00:31:18.404 --> 00:31:19.590\nNow I'm off to the races.\n\n617\n00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:24.205\nYou have to really kind of take a look and\nplan out and figure out what is\n\n618\n00:31:24.205 --> 00:31:28.514\nthe best way to organize your data,\nwhat drives do I need to use.\n\n619\n00:31:28.514 --> 00:31:29.755\nIt takes a little bit.\n\n620\n00:31:29.755 --> 00:31:33.492\nBut I'm confident, Don, you did\na great job at explaining this to us.\n\n621\n00:31:33.492 --> 00:31:37.552\nI'm confident that our viewers after this\nepisode will be much more equipped to\n\n622\n00:31:37.552 --> 00:31:38.532\nhandle that task.\n\n623\n00:31:38.532 --> 00:31:40.772\nNow is there anything else that we\nneed to cover for this episode?\n\n624\n00:31:40.772 --> 00:31:43.503\n>> Well, once we picked our drives,\nthe next thing is to get them set up, and\n\n625\n00:31:43.503 --> 00:31:44.532\nwe haven't seen that yet.\n\n626\n00:31:44.532 --> 00:31:47.206\nWe will get a chance to see that in our\nnext episode when we jump in to our RAID\n\n627\n00:31:47.206 --> 00:31:50.370\nlevels which is an important decision\nto make when you implement your drives.\n\n628\n00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.003\nAnd then we'll start talking about\ncreating the LUNS and all the other\n\n629\n00:31:53.003 --> 00:31:56.184\ntechnology we need to get in place to make\nit where these drives are actually useful.\n\n630\n00:31:56.184 --> 00:31:59.210\nBut I think we've covered everything you\nneed to know as far as your shopping list\n\n631\n00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:00.650\nwhen you go to buy the storage.\n\n632\n00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.800\n>> All right, well, thanks a lot again,\nDon, and we thank you guys for watching.\n\n633\n00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.680\nWe'll go ahead and sign off

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.680\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n4\n00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.220\nwe're continuing on\nwith Cloud Plus Series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.300\nAnd joining us back in the studio\ntoday is our good friend,\n\n6\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.000\nour mentor, the guiding light\nthat is showing us the way.\n\n7\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.120\nThat is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.520\nDon, welcome to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.580\n>> Thanks for having me, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.740\nExcellent intro, as always.\n\n11\n00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.580\n[LAUGH] Ready to jump back in\nto the world of Cloud Plus.\n\n12\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.100\nAnd in our last episode if,\nyou're watching these in order,\n\n13\n00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.850\nwe talked a bit about storage, and\nthe different types of drives and\n\n14\n00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.050\nmedia that you might pop into the storage\nfor your virtualization environment.\n\n15\n00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.840\nWell once you have the drives\npopped into your servers, or\n\n16\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.810\ninto your SAN,\nthe next step is to configure them.\n\n17\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.620\nAnd before we start configuring them,\nwe have to make some decisions on\n\n18\n00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.840\nhow we're going to be\narranging that storage and\n\n19\n00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.600\nthe file systems that we're\ngoing to place on them.\n\n20\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.958\nSo, that's what we're going to\ntalk about here in this episode.\n\n21\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.800\nWe're going to take a look at RAID,\nwhich is how we build in redundancy and\n\n22\n00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.860\nefficiency into the storage, and we're\ngoing to get a chance to take a look at\n\n23\n00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.930\nthe file systems that you may\nbe using on top of those drives.\n\n24\n00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.630\n>> Well, Don I will spare our viewers\nthe ubiquitous joke of it kills bugs dead.\n\n25\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.380\nAnd you know,\nI kind of did just make the joke.\n\n26\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.480\n>> Good job.\n>> I know I slid it in and\n\n27\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.070\nyet I didn't do it, that's how I roll.\n\n28\n00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.990\nBut it is something that\nwe do need to understand.\n\n29\n00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.860\nAnd if you're at this level, you've\nprobably encountered RAID before, but\n\n30\n00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.770\nwe're going to go over it again, make sure\nyou understand some of the particulars\n\n31\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.710\nabout the common types of RAID that\nyou will use in a SAN environment, or\n\n32\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.660\na storage-attached environment.\n\n33\n00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.830\nSo Don, let's start there.\n\n34\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.060\nLet's start with RAID.\n\n35\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.156\n>> All right, so the key thing to think\nabout with a SAN is that you're going to\n\n36\n00:01:44.156 --> 00:01:46.210\nhave a lot of drives, a lot.\n\n37\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.100\nWhen you buy a SAN,\n\n38\n00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.180\nusually the smallest one you can buy\nhas about a 15 bay drive enclosure.\n\n39\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.130\nYou can have the 15 drives\njust right out of the box.\n\n40\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.300\nThen you start adding more enclosures\nto it and more, and more, and more.\n\n41\n00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.330\nAnd you can have a SAN And\nwith 250, 750 drives.\n\n42\n00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.750\nI'm not talking about 750 gigs,\nI'm talking about 750 actual hard dives,\n\n43\n00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.935\nand it could take more then\none rack in your server room.\n\n44\n00:02:06.935 --> 00:02:09.640\nSANs could get really really large, and\n\n45\n00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.630\nthe main reason the do that is\nbecause in a lot of configurations,\n\n46\n00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.780\nthe more physical disks you have,\nthe better performance you get.\n\n47\n00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.840\nInstead of having one drive doing\nthe read and write operation,\n\n48\n00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.970\nwe can have more than one drive doing it.\n\n49\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.980\nWe can spread our reads and\nwrites out across many drives, and\n\n50\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.910\nyou get data at a much faster rate.\n\n51\n00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.645\nYou can also build a lot\nmore redundancy in there,\n\n52\n00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:32.840\nbecause we all know that drives fail,\nright?\n\n53\n00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.200\nAnd so if I have one hard drive, I might\nhave a second hard drive as a spare.\n\n54\n00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.770\nBut if I have 1,000 hard drives,\nhow many spares do I need?\n\n55\n00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.660\nQuite a few.\n\n56\n00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.730\nAnd with a SAN, we can pool those all\ntogether and have them available.\n\n57\n00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.580\nSo there's some really neat\ntechnologies that are there.\n\n58\n00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.920\nBut when you've got more than one drive,\nand we need a technology to link them all\n\n59\n00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.110\ntogether, typically\nthat's going to be RAID.\n\n60\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.390\nAnd RAID, it's one of those terms that,\nit stands for many things.\n\n61\n00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.280\nIt used to be redundant\narray of inexpensive disks.\n\n62\n00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.850\nNow people like to call it redundant\narray of independent disks.\n\n63\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.380\nThey're not necessarily independent\nif they're in an array are they?\n\n64\n00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.060\nBut that's what they've chosen to make it.\n\n65\n00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.166\nSo, we have RAID which allows us\nto combine more than one disk,\n\n66\n00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:15.581\nto create a single virtual\ndisk that we can then use.\n\n67\n00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.448\nOur operating systems, our virtual\nmachines, they just need one disk, but\n\n68\n00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:22.880\non the back end, this is spread\nacross more than one physical disk.\n\n69\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.970\nOne of the earliest forms of this\nwas something called RAID 0, and\n\n70\n00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.330\nI've got a little diagram here that\nkind of shows how RAID 0 works.\n\n71\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.550\nRAID 0 is also called striping,\nand the way that it works is,\n\n72\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.540\ninstead of writing your\ndata just to one disk,\n\n73\n00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.300\nit spreads your data across multiple\ndisks, and it does those in stripes.\n\n74\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.720\nAnd so when you create a striped array,\nyou tell it how many disks you have.\n\n75\n00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.450\nIn my case, I've got three.\n\n76\n00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.850\nAnd then when it starts writing data,\nit will write some data to the first disk,\n\n77\n00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.530\nand then it'll move over and\nwrite data to the next disk.\n\n78\n00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.360\nAnd it's doing this according\nto a stripe size that we define.\n\n79\n00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.160\nWhen you build your array you can say,\nI want my stripes to be 64k in size, or\n\n80\n00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.010\n128k, or 2 MBs, or\nwhatever it is you want, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.220\nThe smaller you make it,\nthe more efficient it can be, so\n\n82\n00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.510\nit's normally somewhere like 64k.\n\n83\n00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.830\nSo if I'm writing a one megabit file,\nthe first 64k would write onto disk one,\n\n84\n00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.590\nthe second 64k would write onto disk two,\nthe third 64k would write onto disk three,\n\n85\n00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.720\nand then the fourth 64k would\nwrite back to disk one again, and\n\n86\n00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.750\nthen the fifth 64k would\nwrite to disk two, and so on.\n\n87\n00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.006\nAnd it would stripe like that between\nthe drives as it wrote all of my data out.\n\n88\n00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:39.150\nAlright, that means that when I'm writing,\nI could be writing the first, second, and\n\n89\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.880\nthird 64 kilobytes of that\nfile all at the same time.\n\n90\n00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.130\nI can be writing to all three\ndisks at the same time,\n\n91\n00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.800\ngetting three times the write performance\nthan I would off of a single disk.\n\n92\n00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.720\nAnd reads gets the same benefit.\n\n93\n00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.940\nWhen I go to read this file, I could be\nreading the first 64k, really the first,\n\n94\n00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.275\nwhat would that be, 192k right,\nall at the same time,\n\n95\n00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:03.990\nbecause I can be reading from disks one,\ntwo, and three at the same time.\n\n96\n00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.560\nRight?\n\n97\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.665\nSo that's what RAID 0 does, is it helps\nus to get to get increased performance,\n\n98\n00:05:08.665 --> 00:05:12.340\nbecause we're involving more than\none disk in the communication.\n\n99\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.310\nNow if that sounds great,\nthat's because it is.\n\n100\n00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.910\nIt's awesome.\n\n101\n00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:16.830\nIt's amazing.\n\n102\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.850\nIf I have ten drives in a RAID 0 array,\nI'm going to get\n\n103\n00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.610\nten times the write performance and\nten times the read performance.\n\n104\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.200\nIf I have 20 drives in that array, we're\ntalking about 20 times the performance,\n\n105\n00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.650\nassuming we've got\nthe bandwidth to handle it.\n\n106\n00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.360\nSo, you can really get some\nimpressive speeds out of this stuff.\n\n107\n00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.190\nIt's really beneficial, but there's\none glaring problem with RAID 0, and\n\n108\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.460\nthat's the amount of redundancy.\n\n109\n00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.240\nLike its name implies\nthe redundancy is zero.\n\n110\n00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.520\nSo if I have even a single drive fail,\nI'll lose all my data.\n\n111\n00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.960\nIf we go back to the diagram,\nlet's say that the middle hard drive here,\n\n112\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.600\nthis drive completely fails.\n\n113\n00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.000\nWell, if I lose this drive, and it just\ngoes away, now I want to read that data.\n\n114\n00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.320\nI've got the first 64k.\n\n115\n00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.540\nI lost the second 64k.\n\n116\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.880\nI've got the third 64k.\n\n117\n00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.070\nI've got the fourth.\n\n118\n00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.340\nI lost the fifth.\n\n119\n00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.090\nI've lost a third of my file, and\nif this is a Word document, or\n\n120\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.420\na virtual machine hard drive, what good\nis two thirds of the file going to do me?\n\n121\n00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.400\nNo good.\n\n122\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.320\nThe data's gone.\n\n123\n00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.160\nIt's dead.\n\n124\n00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.600\nRAID 0 gives us no redundancy.\n\n125\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.338\nSo while it gives us really\nimpressive performance,\n\n126\n00:06:24.338 --> 00:06:27.500\nit kind of hurts us on\nthe redundancy side.\n\n127\n00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.500\nBut if I've got data where I need just\nthe absolute best performance possible,\n\n128\n00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.860\nthis is how we're going to get it.\n\n129\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.450\nAll right?\n\n130\n00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.310\nNow, it's not giving us a redundancy,\nbut there's other ways we can get it.\n\n131\n00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.610\nThis might be in a cluster.\n\n132\n00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.570\nAnd so I might have another server with\na full replica of the data on the other\n\n133\n00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.580\nserver, and it's got RAID 0 also.\n\n134\n00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.650\nAnd so if this one fails,\nwe just flip over to the other server.\n\n135\n00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.830\nIt's got its own copy of the storage.\n\n136\n00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.760\nIt's got RAID 0 there, too, and we go.\n\n137\n00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.400\nSo don't rule out RAID 0.\n\n138\n00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.630\nDon't walk into a production data center\nassuming that you're not going to see RAID\n\n139\n00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.690\n0 anywhere, because if performance\nis the key, RAID 0 is what you want.\n\n140\n00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.540\nAnd so most modern SANS do support RAID 0,\nand if you set it up properly,\n\n141\n00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.140\nwhere you've got a redundant\ncopy of the data somewhere else,\n\n142\n00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.690\nyou can do it safely and not have to\nworry about not having redundancy.\n\n143\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.990\nYou're just not getting\nthe redundancy from RAID 0.\n\n144\n00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.742\n>> Yeah, RAID 0 tends to get a pretty rap.\n\n145\n00:07:14.742 --> 00:07:19.040\nJust think, I don't know why that's\naround, because If you lose anything,\n\n146\n00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.580\nif you lose any of those disks\nthe entirety of it is gone.\n\n147\n00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.560\nBut, like Don said, if that\nperformance is key, I have to have it\n\n148\n00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.080\ngoing as blazing fast as I possibly can,\nRAID 0 is gonna be the guy you want.\n\n149\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.510\nAnd, you can use some other types\nof strategies to make sure that\n\n150\n00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.590\nif something bad happens,\nyou're not completely out in the woods.\n\n151\n00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.370\n>> Yeah, it's how you can spot\na junior admin from a senior admin.\n\n152\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.900\nA junior admin says I'm not getting\nredundancy, I'm not going to do it.\n\n153\n00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.960\nI'm going to move to this other stuff.\n\n154\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.200\nBut the senior admin says, well,\nwe just need to take other steps and\n\n155\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.590\nwe can still get the benefits here.\n\n156\n00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.950\nSo there's a reason why RAID 0 exists.\n\n157\n00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.020\nOtherwise, it just wouldn't\nexist in the first place.\n\n158\n00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.680\nBut, let's say we do want\nthe redundancy built in.\n\n159\n00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.396\nWell, there's other RAID levels for that.\n\n160\n00:07:58.396 --> 00:08:01.037\nRAID 1 is another one that's very popular.\n\n161\n00:08:01.037 --> 00:08:03.881\nYou usually see RAID 1 with\noperating system drives.\n\n162\n00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:06.187\nAreas where you're not\nworried about performance,\n\n163\n00:08:06.187 --> 00:08:08.142\nyou're worried about redundancy, right?\n\n164\n00:08:08.142 --> 00:08:12.173\nRAID 0 gave me great performance,\nnot so great redundancy.\n\n165\n00:08:12.173 --> 00:08:16.760\nRAID 1 gives me great redundancy,\nnot so great performance.\n\n166\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.350\nThe way RAID 1 works is it mirrors data.\n\n167\n00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:24.386\nWhen I write the first block of my\ndata over here, maybe that's 64K.\n\n168\n00:08:24.386 --> 00:08:28.270\nWell, I would write an exact\ncopy of that data over here.\n\n169\n00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.030\nAnd we do the same thing for\nevery block of data that we write.\n\n170\n00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.840\nWe're always copying it from one side\nto the other, exact copies, right?\n\n171\n00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.600\nNow what that means is, whenever I write\nto one disk, I have to write to the other.\n\n172\n00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.440\nSo two right operations\nhappen at the same time.\n\n173\n00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.143\nWell, if I got SATA drives or SAS drives,\nthey've got dedicated controllers for\n\n174\n00:08:47.143 --> 00:08:49.170\nthat so there's no competition.\n\n175\n00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.830\nI write at the same speed\nthat I normally write.\n\n176\n00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.660\nI just am writing twice.\n\n177\n00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.860\nWhen I read, I only read from one disk.\n\n178\n00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.255\nI don't need to read from the other disk,\n\n179\n00:08:58.255 --> 00:09:00.610\ncuz it's got a copy of the same data,\nright?\n\n180\n00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.350\nIf I'm reading block one over here,\n\n181\n00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.700\nthere's no need of me reading\nblock one from the other disk.\n\n182\n00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.020\nIt's the same data.\n\n183\n00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.398\nSo I read from one disk, which means I\nread at the same speed I normally would.\n\n184\n00:09:10.398 --> 00:09:13.970\nWith RAID 1, you read and\nwrite at the same speed as normal.\n\n185\n00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.370\nNow, let me just do\na quick caveat in here.\n\n186\n00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.120\nEverything that I'm saying assumes\nthat we're using hardware RAID.\n\n187\n00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.480\nIf you have a SAN,\nit supports hardware RAID.\n\n188\n00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.497\nThere some operating systems that will\ndo software RAID, that's not good for\n\n189\n00:09:25.497 --> 00:09:26.052\nproduction.\n\n190\n00:09:26.052 --> 00:09:29.615\nSoftware RAID does it in software and\nwhen you're writing these things,\n\n191\n00:09:29.615 --> 00:09:31.632\nlike doing double writes, it hurts CPU.\n\n192\n00:09:31.632 --> 00:09:34.372\nYou're writing twice, it has to think\ntwice and it has to write twice.\n\n193\n00:09:34.372 --> 00:09:37.543\nAnd so it actually hurts performance and\nsoftware, and so\n\n194\n00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:40.740\nI never use software rated\nproduction anywhere ever.\n\n195\n00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.694\nI just don't.\n\n196\n00:09:41.694 --> 00:09:43.418\nHardware RAID is so cheap these days.\n\n197\n00:09:43.418 --> 00:09:46.676\nIt's built into the motherboards of even\nthe cheapest computers that there really\n\n198\n00:09:46.676 --> 00:09:48.314\nis no reason to do software RAID anymore.\n\n199\n00:09:48.314 --> 00:09:50.886\nSo, when I say that this\ngives us no performance hit,\n\n200\n00:09:50.886 --> 00:09:53.970\nthat's true assuming we've\ngot hardware RAID, right?\n\n201\n00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.750\nSo, it's able to write\nthis data at wire speed,\n\n202\n00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.320\nwriting it at the same time,\nno big deal there, right?\n\n203\n00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.310\nOne of the negatives with RAID 1 is we\ndon't get a performance increase, right?\n\n204\n00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.000\nWe have just normal performance.\n\n205\n00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.150\nOne of the benefits is we get redundancy.\n\n206\n00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.570\nBut another negative is it's expensive.\n\n207\n00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:11.960\nAnd, I know what you're thinking.\n\n208\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.460\nStorage isn't terribly expensive, right?\n\n209\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.950\nBut if you think about it,\n50% of my storage here is being wasted.\n\n210\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.270\nIf I have two drives that are a mirror of\neach, I'm really only using one of them.\n\n211\n00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.650\nThe other drive is wasted\nuntil I have a failure.\n\n212\n00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.750\nWhen you have a failure, that drive\nis worth its weight in gold, right?\n\n213\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.230\nYou love that drive.\n\n214\n00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:33.120\nBut all the time that the drive\nis healthy, it's being wasted.\n\n215\n00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.995\nSo you'll lose 50% of your storage\nwith the mirror and that's expensive.\n\n216\n00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:39.222\nExpensive in terms of efficiency, right?\n\n217\n00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:44.602\nSo there's other options that help\nto alleviate that, like RAID 5.\n\n218\n00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:51.000\nAnd what RAID 5 does is it tries to find\na middle ground between RAID 0 and RAID 1.\n\n219\n00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.220\nRAID 5 uses striping to\nget us better performance,\n\n220\n00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.170\nget more than one disc involved\nin the reads and writes.\n\n221\n00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.860\nBut it combines it with parity to\ncreate the equivalent of a mirror\n\n222\n00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.830\nto give us redundancy in case\nthere's a drive failure, right?\n\n223\n00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:09.310\nSo it's a middle ground and like the name\nimplies, it gets us a bit of a performance\n\n224\n00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.210\nincrease, but not an amazing\nperformance increase like RAID 0.\n\n225\n00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.880\nAnd it gets us a bit of redundancy, but\n\n226\n00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.990\nnot the great redundancy\nthat we get with mirroring.\n\n227\n00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.940\nSo it's not as good as either of the other\ntwo technologies, but it makes up for\n\n228\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.650\nall the negatives, right?\n\n229\n00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.742\nThe way RAID 5 works is we do striping, so\nyou'll notice where I've got block one,\n\n230\n00:11:25.742 --> 00:11:28.277\nblock two, block three,\nblock four, block five,\n\n231\n00:11:28.277 --> 00:11:30.430\nblock six kind of spread\nacross the drives.\n\n232\n00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:36.130\nBut notice that I've also got\nthis parity stripe, okay?\n\n233\n00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.901\nWith parity, what it does is it looks\nat the data in block in one and\n\n234\n00:11:39.901 --> 00:11:44.512\nit looks at the data in block two, and it\nlooks at it in the individual bit level.\n\n235\n00:11:44.512 --> 00:11:48.804\nAnd it says if drive one\nhas a one stored here and\n\n236\n00:11:48.804 --> 00:11:55.532\ndrive two has a zero stored here,\nthen when I add one and zero, I get one.\n\n237\n00:11:55.532 --> 00:11:56.698\nOne's an odd number, and\n\n238\n00:11:56.698 --> 00:11:59.250\nit puts a mark here that says\nthis should be an odd number.\n\n239\n00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.480\nAnd if I've got a one here and a one here,\nit adds those together and gets two.\n\n240\n00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.130\nThat's an even number and\nso it puts a note here and\n\n241\n00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.320\nsays it should be an even number.\n\n242\n00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.050\nIt's a zero or one, one means an odd\nnumber, one means an even number.\n\n243\n00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:15.255\nAnd what that does is it makes\nit where if I lose a drive, so\n\n244\n00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:19.287\nif that drive just goes away,\nI've got block one, and\n\n245\n00:12:19.287 --> 00:12:22.902\nblock two is gone, but\nmy parity is still there.\n\n246\n00:12:22.902 --> 00:12:27.162\nAnd so it can look at block one, and\nyou can see it has a one or a zero.\n\n247\n00:12:27.162 --> 00:12:28.882\nAnd then it can look at parity and\n\n248\n00:12:28.882 --> 00:12:32.402\nit can say, should these add up to\nan odd number or an even number?\n\n249\n00:12:32.402 --> 00:12:34.955\nAnd if it should add up to an odd number,\nI've got a one here,\n\n250\n00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:36.980\nthat means I must have a zero here.\n\n251\n00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.500\nIf it should add up to an even number,\nI've got a one here,\n\n252\n00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.980\nthat means I'd have to have a one here.\n\n253\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.360\nAnd so it can rebuild,\nit can recalculate what is now lost,\n\n254\n00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.670\nwhat should have been there.\n\n255\n00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.560\nOkay, it's a mathematical operation\nthat it's doing though, and that's slow.\n\n256\n00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.080\nSo when you have a disk failure,\nyour performance drops.\n\n257\n00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.080\nBut at least your data's there.\n\n258\n00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.470\nYou still have access to your data, and\nyou can bring in a new hard drive and\n\n259\n00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.800\npop it into that spot, and\nit'll rebuild the drive.\n\n260\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.060\nIt'll rebuild it and\nput that data back in, and there you go.\n\n261\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.200\nSo you can actually survive\na single drive failure with RAID 5.\n\n262\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.350\nIf one drive fails, then, I'm okay.\n\n263\n00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.840\nI can rebuild.\nNow if a second drive fails,\n\n264\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.810\nI'm out of luck, right?\n\n265\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.600\nRAID 5 can only survive one\ndrive failure and that's it.\n\n266\n00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.150\nSo on a positive side, I do get better\nperformance on reads and writes.\n\n267\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.740\nWhen I read and write,\nI'm writing on more than one disk.\n\n268\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.850\nNot all of them though.\n\n269\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.270\nSo see like I'm writing block one,\nI'm writing block two.\n\n270\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.630\nAnd then I've got to calculate parity.\n\n271\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.610\nSo instead of writing to three discs,\nI'm really only writing to two.\n\n272\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.725\nAnd then I have to do a mathematical\noperation on top of that to calculate for\n\n273\n00:13:36.725 --> 00:13:37.335\nthe third drive.\n\n274\n00:13:37.335 --> 00:13:41.265\nAnd if we're doing that in hardware, this\nhappens really, really, really fast, but\n\n275\n00:13:41.265 --> 00:13:43.395\nit's not as great\na performance gain as RAID 0.\n\n276\n00:13:43.395 --> 00:13:46.525\nBetter than RAID one,\ncuz it is actually worthwhile to read and\n\n277\n00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:49.605\nwrite to more than one disk, but\none RAID 1, you don't get any benefit.\n\n278\n00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:53.310\nHere you do, but\nit's not as great as RAID 0.\n\n279\n00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.200\nAnd I can have a drive fail\njust like with a mirror.\n\n280\n00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.970\nBut I still get that kind\nof benefit of RAID 0.\n\n281\n00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.250\nSo a good mix between the two.\n\n282\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.650\nThat being said there are better options.\n\n283\n00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.500\nAnd when you fire up your SAN for the\nfirst time and you start adding drives,\n\n284\n00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.040\nyou'll probably see some of the other\noptions that are less common.\n\n285\n00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.160\nThe ones that I just showed you RAID 0,\nRAID 1, RAID 5,\n\n286\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.740\nthose are common everywhere,\nservers, desktops, whatever.\n\n287\n00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.680\nBut the next couple of ones that I'm gonna\nshow you, you never see on desktops.\n\n288\n00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.110\nWell, a normal, saying, people's desktops.\n\n289\n00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.990\nBut you see them in server\nenvironments all the time.\n\n290\n00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.350\nAnd what they are, some additional RAID\nlevels that are designed to help better\n\n291\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.713\nsecure or improve performance on your\nsystems at the cost of usually additional\n\n292\n00:14:34.713 --> 00:14:37.212\nhard drives or lost efficiency, all right?\n\n293\n00:14:37.212 --> 00:14:39.912\nSo the first one I wanna\nshow you is RAID 6.\n\n294\n00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:44.293\nRAID 6 is kinda one of those unofficial\nRAIDs that isn't actually part of\n\n295\n00:14:44.293 --> 00:14:46.990\na standard or anything,\nbut it is out there.\n\n296\n00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.330\nYou will see it most SAN\nsystems support it these days.\n\n297\n00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.740\nAnd what it does is the same thing\na RAID 5, but double parity, right?\n\n298\n00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.809\nOne of the big problems with RAID 5,\nif I lose a drive, I'm okay,\n\n299\n00:14:59.809 --> 00:15:01.642\nI'm still up, my data is up.\n\n300\n00:15:01.642 --> 00:15:04.442\nBut if I lose the second drive,\nI'm out of luck and now,\n\n301\n00:15:04.442 --> 00:15:06.062\nI've lost all my data, right?\n\n302\n00:15:06.062 --> 00:15:09.994\nThe other thing is with RAID 5, when I\nlose a disk, I can put a new disk in and\n\n303\n00:15:09.994 --> 00:15:10.942\nit'll rebuild.\n\n304\n00:15:10.942 --> 00:15:15.239\nBut as drives get bigger and bigger, and\nbigger, when you have terabyte drives or\n\n305\n00:15:15.239 --> 00:15:20.180\nfour terabyte drives, rebuilding that\ndisk can take hours and hours, right?\n\n306\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.751\nWe had one fail in ours not too\nlong ago and when we replaced it,\n\n307\n00:15:22.751 --> 00:15:24.392\nit took six hours to rebuild that disk.\n\n308\n00:15:24.392 --> 00:15:29.572\nSo for six hours, I had a spare in\nthere but it was having to rebuild.\n\n309\n00:15:29.572 --> 00:15:33.119\nAnd so I was still vulnerable even\nthough I had swapped out the drive until\n\n310\n00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:34.060\nsix hours went by.\n\n311\n00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.760\nSo for six hours you're sitting\nthere biting your nails going,\n\n312\n00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.205\nif I have another drive fail,\nI've got a real problem,\n\n313\n00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:41.790\nI've got to go to my back up tapes,\nwhich is not fun, right?\n\n314\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.022\nIt's gonna take a long time.\n\n315\n00:15:43.022 --> 00:15:47.070\nSo what RAID 6 does is it says, hey, if\none parity is good, imagine if we had two,\n\n316\n00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.802\nand that's exactly what it does.\n\n317\n00:15:48.802 --> 00:15:50.342\nIt does double parity, right?\n\n318\n00:15:50.342 --> 00:15:52.342\nSo here I wrote block one,\nI wrote block two.\n\n319\n00:15:52.342 --> 00:15:56.469\nI write parity one and I write parity two,\nand the parity are identical.\n\n320\n00:15:56.469 --> 00:15:58.213\nParity one, parity two,\nits the same thing,\n\n321\n00:15:58.213 --> 00:15:59.659\nit's just making a second copy of it.\n\n322\n00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:02.872\nAnd so then as we write our additional\ndata, we're able to write it and\n\n323\n00:16:02.872 --> 00:16:04.627\nwe continue making these duplicate.\n\n324\n00:16:04.627 --> 00:16:07.289\nParity blocks, Parity 1, Parity 2.\n\n325\n00:16:07.289 --> 00:16:08.650\nParity 1, Parity 2.\n\n326\n00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.670\nJust writing it over and over again as\nwe lay that out across these disks.\n\n327\n00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.590\nAnd this way, if I have a failure,\nand I lose a disk,\n\n328\n00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.430\nlet's say I lose this one which\nis actually parity heavy.\n\n329\n00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.900\nThat would be the best one to lose.\n\n330\n00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.740\nIf I lose that one, all right, well,\nI've got block one, I've got block two,\n\n331\n00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.870\nI've got block three, I've got block four.\n\n332\n00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.240\nBlock five is missing, so\nI'm gonna have to rebuild that.\n\n333\n00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.630\nBlock six, block seven,\nblock eight is missing, so\n\n334\n00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.680\nI really just lost blocks five and eight,\nand I can rebuild those for parity.\n\n335\n00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.360\nAnd if I throw in a new disk,\nit'll start rebuilding.\n\n336\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.110\nBut, if I have another failure, well,\n\n337\n00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.200\nI've actually still got the parity blocks\nto compensate for losing five and eight.\n\n338\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.230\nAnd I'm okay, I could actually\nuse two disks with RAID 6.\n\n339\n00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.800\nNow the cost comes in the form of storage,\nright?\n\n340\n00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.180\nStoring that extra parity block\nmeans I'm losing extra storage.\n\n341\n00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.390\nI'm actually losing half\nmy storage in this model.\n\n342\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.500\nIf I have four drives, I'm losing\n50% of my storage to parity, right?\n\n343\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.230\nBut, if I had three drives,\nI lose a third of it.\n\n344\n00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.200\nSo, it's kinda increasing\nthe amount of space that I waste.\n\n345\n00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.278\nThe more drives I have the more\nefficient that parity becomes.\n\n346\n00:17:10.278 --> 00:17:13.080\nSo, RAID 5 arrays and\nRAID 6 arrays that only have three or\n\n347\n00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.040\nfour discs are pretty inefficient.\n\n348\n00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.289\nBut a RAID 5 or\na RAID 6 array with 20 discs,\n\n349\n00:17:17.289 --> 00:17:19.609\nstarts to become a lot more efficient,\nright?\n\n350\n00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:21.521\nAnd it can survive that\nfailure a little bit more.\n\n351\n00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:23.380\nSo the bigger the array, the better.\n\n352\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.430\nAnd the bigger the array,\nthe more discs you can read from, and\n\n353\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.640\nthe more discs you can write to.\n\n354\n00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.133\nSo with RAID 5 and RAID 6 you get better\nperformance, the more disks you have,\n\n355\n00:17:32.133 --> 00:17:33.220\nsame with RAID 0.\n\n356\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.980\nThe more disks you have,\nthe better performance.\n\n357\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.030\nBut on RAID 0, the more disks you have,\nthe bigger risk you have.\n\n358\n00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.494\nOn RAID 5 and RAID 6, you have the same\nlevel of risk whether you have 3 disks or\n\n359\n00:17:41.494 --> 00:17:42.290\n20 disks.\n\n360\n00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.500\nSo, kinda trade off there between those.\n\n361\n00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.427\n>> So, it gets exponentially better\nas we add disks to the system,\n\n362\n00:17:48.427 --> 00:17:50.916\nthus increasing your loveliness of it.\n\n363\n00:17:50.916 --> 00:17:51.526\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n364\n00:17:51.526 --> 00:17:52.916\n>> Yeah, this is a great system.\n\n365\n00:17:52.916 --> 00:17:55.196\nNow, Don, we've talked about RAID 5 and 6,\n\n366\n00:17:55.196 --> 00:17:56.025\npretty common.\n\n367\n00:17:56.025 --> 00:17:58.560\n5, specifically, is very,\nvery common I know.\n\n368\n00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.000\nBut also a couple other common ones, and\n\n369\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.995\nit's got many different ways in\nwhich you can name these things.\n\n370\n00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:05.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've seen it RAID 10,\n\n371\n00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.406\nI've seen it RAID 1+0.\n\n372\n00:18:07.406 --> 00:18:12.420\nI've seen it as a mirror of stripes or\nstripe of mirrors or however you want it.\n\n373\n00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.710\nThese are meant to be like super\nredundant, super performance, right?\n\n374\n00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:20.210\n>> Yes, let's say that you want it all.\n\n375\n00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.530\nI'm not gonna sacrifice anything,\nI want everything.\n\n376\n00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:27.760\nI want great performance and\nI want redundancy.\n\n377\n00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.440\nI want my cake and I wanna eat it too.\n\n378\n00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.309\nI want the benefits of RAID 0\nwith the redundancy of RAID 1 and\n\n379\n00:18:32.309 --> 00:18:34.032\nI don't wanna any of the negatives.\n\n380\n00:18:34.032 --> 00:18:35.632\nYou just take those negatives and\nstuff them, right?\n\n381\n00:18:35.632 --> 00:18:37.200\nI want the best.\n\n382\n00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.430\nWell, get ready to pony up some money.\n\n383\n00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.700\nBut if you've got the money,\nyou can get the best.\n\n384\n00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.890\nIf you've got the money you can\nget the performance of RAID 0 and\n\n385\n00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.700\nthe redundancy of RAID 1 and\n\n386\n00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.900\nnot have any of the negatives of any\nof the other ones that I talked about.\n\n387\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.724\nBut, it's gonna cost you money, you're\ngonna have to have some extra drives.\n\n388\n00:18:53.724 --> 00:18:55.350\nLet me show you how this works.\n\n389\n00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.075\nThe most common form of this\nis what's called RAID 10 and\n\n390\n00:18:59.075 --> 00:19:02.052\nit's normally written RAID 1+0, right?\n\n391\n00:19:02.052 --> 00:19:04.150\nNow, Daniel mentioned he's\nheard it more than one way.\n\n392\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.350\nYou can get RAID 0+1.\n\n393\n00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.870\nI'll show you that one in a minute.\n\n394\n00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:12.510\nBut, RAID 10, RAID 1+0, this is the most\ncommon and it's called striped mirrors.\n\n395\n00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.910\nSo, let's take a look at how this works.\n\n396\n00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.470\nBasically, you start by\nmirroring some drives.\n\n397\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.820\nSo, I've got a hard drive right here and\nI mirror it down to this one.\n\n398\n00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.250\nThat's RAID 1.\n\n399\n00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.420\nThen I take this drive and\n\n400\n00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.290\nI mirror it down to this one, that's\nRAID 1 and then I take this drive and\n\n401\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.450\nmirror it down here and that's RAID 1,\nso now I've got three RAID 1 mirrors.\n\n402\n00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:34.060\nThat's these purple guys right here,\nall mirrors.\n\n403\n00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.480\nThen we build a stripe across\nthe mirror and of course,\n\n404\n00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.790\nthe stripe gets mirrored because these\nguys are all mirrored, too, right?\n\n405\n00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.300\nYou're really building one stripe but\nit mirrors it down here.\n\n406\n00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.860\nSo, I've got a stripe across my mirrors.\n\n407\n00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.600\nNow, when I write to the disk,\nI can write across this stripe.\n\n408\n00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.980\nI can write to all three discs at once.\n\n409\n00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.710\nAnd the mirror is gonna mirror\nit down to these other discs.\n\n410\n00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.630\nAnd when I go to read, I can read from\nall three of these discs at once.\n\n411\n00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.397\nAnd again the mirror is gonna, well,\n\n412\n00:20:02.397 --> 00:20:05.172\nnot come into play because\nI'm just reading data, right?\n\n413\n00:20:05.172 --> 00:20:07.590\nI don't need to read from\nthese guys down here.\n\n414\n00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:12.210\nSo I get the benefits of a stripe,\nreading and writing for than one disc and\n\n415\n00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:17.600\nI get the benefits of a RAID 1 mirror\nbecause the data is being mirrored.\n\n416\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.850\nI can have a drive fail.\n\n417\n00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.400\nAnd actually the drive\nfailures can be kinda fun.\n\n418\n00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.340\nI could have this drive up here fail.\n\n419\n00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.550\nSo, it's gone.\n\n420\n00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.710\nAnd then I could have a drive,\nmaybe one that's down in the bottom,\n\n421\n00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.840\nlike this drive here could fail.\n\n422\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.920\nAnd when they fail,\nI might not even care about this one.\n\n423\n00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.900\nIf this is the active stripe up top,\n\n424\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.160\nI don't even care about\nthis drive that failed.\n\n425\n00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.370\nIt was a redundant one anyway, it's gone.\n\n426\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.250\nBut now I read from this disk,\nI read from this disk.\n\n427\n00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.560\nWhen I get here, oop, it's gone.\n\n428\n00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.780\nI just jumped right down here and\nread from this one.\n\n429\n00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.140\nSo, I've now survived\na single disk failure.\n\n430\n00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.140\nI've actually survived\na multi disk failure.\n\n431\n00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.280\nYou can survive many,\nmany disks failing in a RAID 10 array.\n\n432\n00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.980\nThe only scenario that you can't survive\n\n433\n00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.990\nis if the disks failed in the same column,\nright?\n\n434\n00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:03.020\nSo, if I were to lose both of those disks,\nthen I'd be in a bit of a pickle, right?\n\n435\n00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.860\nNow I can read here, I read here, and I've\ngot no backup here and I've lost it, and\n\n436\n00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.610\nI've got a real problem, all right?\n\n437\n00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:13.160\nSo, it's not the be all end all, you still\nhave to have redundancies built in place.\n\n438\n00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.948\nBut, if somebody comes to you and says hey\nDom, we've got this database server, and\n\n439\n00:21:16.948 --> 00:21:19.642\nit needs the fastest reads and\nthe fastest writes possible.\n\n440\n00:21:19.642 --> 00:21:22.406\nYou get me the best\ndisk IO you can get me.\n\n441\n00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:24.260\nAnd it needs to be redundant.\n\n442\n00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.180\nAs soon as I hear that, it's RAID 10.\n\n443\n00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.652\nIt's the only solution really\nthat's gonna work well and\n\n444\n00:21:28.652 --> 00:21:30.222\nprovide all those demands, right.\n\n445\n00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:32.960\nRAID 10 does it, but boy is it expensive.\n\n446\n00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.210\nYou're wasting 50% of your storage.\n\n447\n00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:39.395\nSo, if they tell me I need 10 terabytes\nof storage, I actually need 20 terabytes.\n\n448\n00:21:39.395 --> 00:21:40.530\nBecause I've gotta have a mirror.\n\n449\n00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.630\nI can stripe across\nthe first 10 terabytes and\n\n450\n00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.730\nthen it's gotta be mirrored\nto another 10 terabytes.\n\n451\n00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.954\nYour storage just became twice as\nexpensive, but boy do you get,\n\n452\n00:21:47.954 --> 00:21:50.192\nyou get performance and\nyou get redundancy.\n\n453\n00:21:50.192 --> 00:21:54.660\nYou get multi disk redundancy as\nlong as it's not in the same mirror.\n\n454\n00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.520\nIf one disk fails, you can replace it and\nrebuild the mirror.\n\n455\n00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.778\nAnd rebuilding the mirror's\na lot faster than Raid 5.\n\n456\n00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:02.700\nWith Raid 5, you have to do math to\ncalculate it out and rebuild it.\n\n457\n00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.370\nWith a mirror,\nit just copies the original disk over.\n\n458\n00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.590\nBut if it's a six terabyte disk, that\ncopy's gonna take a little bit, right?\n\n459\n00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.990\nLet's say you're on a SAS 3 drive and\nyou're running it at 12 gigabit, and\n\n460\n00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:17.350\nyou've got over a terabyte of data,\nit's gonna take 30 minutes,\n\n461\n00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.860\n45 minutes to copy that data across and\nget rebuilt.\n\n462\n00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.910\nSo, there's a window of time\nwhere you're still at risk, but\n\n463\n00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.840\nyou get the benefits, right?\n\n464\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.090\nNow this is RAID 10, right?\n\n465\n00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.770\nRAID 1+0.\n\n466\n00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.829\nSome people and\nsome SANs will do RAID 0+1 and\n\n467\n00:22:29.829 --> 00:22:34.964\nI've got a little diagram here and if you\nlook at it, it looks the same, right?\n\n468\n00:22:34.964 --> 00:22:36.514\nThis was one of the easiest diagrams for\nme to make,\n\n469\n00:22:36.514 --> 00:22:38.622\nbecause I just copy the other one,\npaste it right here and I'm done.\n\n470\n00:22:38.622 --> 00:22:40.920\nRAID 0+1 is the same thing.\n\n471\n00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.010\nIt's just done in the other order, right.\n\n472\n00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.410\nIn the last one I said\nthat we built mirrors and\n\n473\n00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:48.590\nthen we striped across the mirror, right?\n\n474\n00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.205\nSo, that you technically have one stripe\nthat then happened to get mirrored.\n\n475\n00:22:51.205 --> 00:22:55.460\nWith RAID 0+1,\nyou build the stripes first.\n\n476\n00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:00.290\nI have two stripes and then you set\nthe mirror on top of the stripes, and\n\n477\n00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:04.290\nso technically,\nyou don't have three mirrors.\n\n478\n00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:08.140\nTechnically you have one,\nthat didn't work out.\n\n479\n00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.232\nTechnically you have one mirror.\n\n480\n00:23:10.232 --> 00:23:15.240\n[LAUGH] I've made my mouse so large that\nI can't seem to click on that square.\n\n481\n00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.070\nThere we go.\n\n482\n00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:20.740\nTechnically you have one mirror\nthat's mirroring the stripes and\n\n483\n00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.550\ngetting them copy between\nthe drives like that.\n\n484\n00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.580\nOkay, so anything I write to\nthe first stripe is then getting near\n\n485\n00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.210\ndown to the other stripe and\nthe mirror sees two drives.\n\n486\n00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.320\nSees these two stripes and that's it.\n\n487\n00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.230\nIt's just a different way going about it.\n\n488\n00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.550\nMost system do RAID 10 not RAID 0+1 and\nwhy is that?\n\n489\n00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.660\nWell, it just depends on\nthe hardware manufacturer,\n\n490\n00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.980\nwhich one they were able to get\nthe best performance out of, right?\n\n491\n00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.670\nCuz they write their own hardware\ninstructions on the back end to handle\n\n492\n00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.050\nthis and some find they can get better\nperformance out of zero plus one.\n\n493\n00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:52.370\nOthers find they can get better\nperformance out of Raid 1+0,\n\n494\n00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.579\nit just depends on the manufacturer,\nand some support both.\n\n495\n00:23:55.579 --> 00:23:58.164\nIf this were both you can pick and\nit usually doesn't matter, but\n\n496\n00:23:58.164 --> 00:24:00.984\nyou need to read your documentation\nto find out if there's a reason they\n\n497\n00:24:00.984 --> 00:24:03.945\nsupport both, because there might be and\nyou need to find out what that is.\n\n498\n00:24:03.945 --> 00:24:06.952\nBut typically, you'll find they\nonly support one or the other.\n\n499\n00:24:06.952 --> 00:24:11.620\n>> That's right, so get a handle\non these specific types of RAID.\n\n500\n00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.000\nUnderstand how they work and how they work\ntogether, and what you might want to use,\n\n501\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.400\nversus that over a different\nscenario that you might be in, so\n\n502\n00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.720\nthat you're prepared for\nwhen that happens.\n\n503\n00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.140\nNow also something we have to be aware of,\nand it's probably not as critical as\n\n504\n00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.140\nsomething like RAID, but\nit's something we do need to know,\n\n505\n00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.440\nand that is the file system types\nthat go on the disks themselves.\n\n506\n00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.700\nThey can work against performance or\nincrease performance or do something for\n\n507\n00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.730\nyou that the other might do.\n\n508\n00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.100\nThere's always a pros and\ncons list that we gotta make, and Don,\n\n509\n00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.980\nyou're gonna walk us through\na few of those today.\n\n510\n00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.950\n>> Absolutely, if you go to the store to\nbuy a hard drive, online, whatever, and\n\n511\n00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.880\nyou go to buy the biggest hard drive you\ncan find, well, today, as far as I know,\n\n512\n00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.060\nthe biggest one you can buy as of\nthe filming of the episode is 8TB.\n\n513\n00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:57.380\nSo I can go and get a 8TB hard drive and I\ncan fire it up in a system, format it and\n\n514\n00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.330\nget to using it.\n\n515\n00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.200\nMost file systems\nare designed to handle 8TB.\n\n516\n00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.120\nMost of them can do that and\nnot have a really big deal about it.\n\n517\n00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.100\nBut when you bring a SAN into the mix,\n\n518\n00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.170\nI'm not talking about one\nhard drive anymore, am I?\n\n519\n00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:13.409\nI might have 20 or 100 or\n200, 1,000 hard drives.\n\n520\n00:25:13.409 --> 00:25:18.693\nAnd if I build a truly massive array,\nif I build a RAID 10 array\n\n521\n00:25:18.693 --> 00:25:24.998\nthat's spread across 80 drives,\nI could have 40 times 8 terabytes.\n\n522\n00:25:24.998 --> 00:25:28.960\nYou could have 2.4 petabytes or\nwhatever of storage.\n\n523\n00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.341\nYou could have an insanely\nlarge array that you create and\n\n524\n00:25:31.341 --> 00:25:33.670\npresent to your operating system.\n\n525\n00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.440\nAnd when that happens,\n\n526\n00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.830\nyour RAID controller might be\nperfectly happy with that.\n\n527\n00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.330\nYour SAN might be\nperfectly happy with that.\n\n528\n00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.380\nBut your operating system might not be.\n\n529\n00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.620\nSo we need to be aware of, in real\nlife we need to be aware of this but\n\n530\n00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.160\nalso on the exam we need to be aware,\n\n531\n00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.260\nthat different file systems have\ndifferent maximum volume sizes.\n\n532\n00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.190\nAnd they may not be able to recognize\nthe size drives that we create,\n\n533\n00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.800\nso we've gotta be careful.\n\n534\n00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.170\nSo I've got a little slide here that I\nworked up that has all the different ones\n\n535\n00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.280\nthat might show up on the exam, and some\nof the limits that we've got out there.\n\n536\n00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.790\nAnd you'll see some of them are really,\nreally big, like UFS.\n\n537\n00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.720\nUFS is the Unix file system.\n\n538\n00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.540\nIt was originally developed for\nBSD and made it into Unix, Linux,\n\n539\n00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.910\nand OSX, or Mac OS.\n\n540\n00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:17.660\nBut it was primarily developed in BSD.\n\n541\n00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:22.443\nAnd it has a maximum file size of 8ZB,\nwhich is massive,\n\n542\n00:26:22.443 --> 00:26:25.344\nand a maximum volume size of 8ZB.\n\n543\n00:26:25.344 --> 00:26:26.700\nIt's big.\n\n544\n00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.611\nIt can handle really, really big stuff,\nand it does it just fine.\n\n545\n00:26:29.611 --> 00:26:33.520\nThe only problem is nobody\nruns UFS these days.\n\n546\n00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.520\nIt exists, a lot of systems support it,\n\n547\n00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.290\nMac OS supports it if you wanna use it,\nbut most people aren't using it.\n\n548\n00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:43.285\nSo instead we find that we're using these\nother file systems that are a little more\n\n549\n00:26:43.285 --> 00:26:45.210\nvendor-specific.\n\n550\n00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.220\nSo in the Linux world,\nyou see the extended file system,\n\n551\n00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.170\nEXT, and there's EXT2, EXT3, EXT4.\n\n552\n00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:56.230\nMost Linux distros, when you install them,\ndo EXT3 by default,\n\n553\n00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.750\nand then you can enable\nthe EXT4 if you want.\n\n554\n00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:02.988\nWell, there's some big differences\nwhen you look at EXT2, 3, and 4.\n\n555\n00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:10.610\nWith 2 and 3 they have a 2TB maximum file\nsize and a 32TB maximum volume size.\n\n556\n00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:15.150\nSo if I create an array that's\nbigger than 32TB, when I go into\n\n557\n00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.940\nLinux I'm gonna have to break it up\ninto 32TB chunks if I want to use it.\n\n558\n00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.900\nAnd even then, when I start to throw\nfiles on it I've got a maximum of 2TB.\n\n559\n00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.580\nNow why is that important to me?\n\n560\n00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:29.260\nWell, when I create a virtual machine, the\nvirtual machine has a virtual hard drive.\n\n561\n00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:33.130\nAnd the virtual hard drive is a file,\n\n562\n00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:37.320\nwhich means it's gonna have\na maximum of 2TB in size.\n\n563\n00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.210\nIf I'm running KBM as\nmy type 1 Hypervisor,\n\n564\n00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:46.150\nI'm running it on top of CentOS or Ubuntu\nor whatever, and my file system is EXT3,\n\n565\n00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.620\nI can't have a virtual machine\nwith a hard drive bigger than 2TB,\n\n566\n00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.230\nbecause that's the maximum file size\nsupported on those file systems.\n\n567\n00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.510\nI'll have to break up the drives\nto get something bigger, and\n\n568\n00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:56.600\nthere's ways to do that.\n\n569\n00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.451\nDifferent operating systems\nhave different technologies.\n\n570\n00:27:58.451 --> 00:28:02.544\nIf I go EXT4,\nI can have up to a 16TB file size and\n\n571\n00:28:02.544 --> 00:28:06.850\nup to 1EX for a volume size,\nso you get much larger.\n\n572\n00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.740\nSo if you're gonna be dealing\nwith large virtual hard drives,\n\n573\n00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.130\nyou'll want to make sure you\nget over to EXT4 if you can.\n\n574\n00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:14.320\nThat's in the Linux world.\n\n575\n00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.700\nWindows has the same thing.\n\n576\n00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.274\nIn Windows you have NTFS,\nFAT32, and ExFAT.\n\n577\n00:28:19.274 --> 00:28:21.980\nThose are the three systems\nthat are really supported now.\n\n578\n00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.445\nFAT32 is the oldest and\nyou'll see it's the smallest.\n\n579\n00:28:25.445 --> 00:28:29.610\n4GB is the max file size and\n8TB is the maximum partition size.\n\n580\n00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.810\nActually in Windows,\nthey cripple it in software so\n\n581\n00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.750\nit's even smaller, but technically\nit can go up to 8TB if you want.\n\n582\n00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.990\nIf you want something bigger, which\nI can have one hard drive that's 8TB.\n\n583\n00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.330\nIf I wanna go bigger,\nFAT32's not gonna work for me.\n\n584\n00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:47.640\nI can go ExFAT, which gives me 16EB and\n64ZB for that storage.\n\n585\n00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:52.055\nAgain, massive sizes, but ExFAT is\nmissing a lot of features that we want,\n\n586\n00:28:52.055 --> 00:28:52.865\nlike journaling.\n\n587\n00:28:52.865 --> 00:28:57.379\nIt's really easy to get data corruption in\nExFAT, so it's normally not recommended to\n\n588\n00:28:57.379 --> 00:29:01.675\nuse ExFAT if you're running Hyper-V,\nMicrosoft's Type 1 hypervisor.\n\n589\n00:29:01.675 --> 00:29:04.606\nSo instead,\nyou're gonna end up at NTFS, and\n\n590\n00:29:04.606 --> 00:29:09.282\nNTFS has a maximum file size of 16EB and\na maximum volume size of 16EB.\n\n591\n00:29:09.282 --> 00:29:12.250\nThat's bigger than what most\npeople are working with today.\n\n592\n00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.130\nTen years from now,\nthat might be different, but for\n\n593\n00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:16.580\nthe next couple of years this\nis plenty of head room, and\n\n594\n00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.380\nMicrosoft will probably improve\nNTFS between now and then.\n\n595\n00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.880\nWe'll see.\n\n596\n00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.910\nSo definitely be aware of that one.\n\n597\n00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.760\nIf you're running VMware, VMware is\ntechnically running Linux under the hood.\n\n598\n00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.610\nIf you have VMware ESX, it is a special\nversion of Linux running under the hood.\n\n599\n00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:36.360\nBut they created their own\nfile system called VMFS.\n\n600\n00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.180\nSo the VMware Virtual Machine File System.\n\n601\n00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:44.730\nAnd on their file system,\nthey've got a 4TB maximum file size and\n\n602\n00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:47.500\na 64TB maximum volume size.\n\n603\n00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.170\nSo if you wanna go bigger than that,\nwell, you're gonna have to break it up.\n\n604\n00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:52.890\nAnd it actually supports\nbreaking it up for you.\n\n605\n00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.650\nIt does it in the background and\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n606\n00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:57.580\nBut under the hood it's\ncapping things out.\n\n607\n00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:02.326\nMaximum file size of 4TB,\nmaximum volume size of 64TB.\n\n608\n00:30:02.326 --> 00:30:04.800\nAnd the last one that's\non the slide here is ZFS.\n\n609\n00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.591\nNow ZFS, most of you guys\naren't gonna see in production.\n\n610\n00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:13.755\nIt was developed for Solaris originally,\nwhich was Sun Microsystems version of BSD.\n\n611\n00:30:13.755 --> 00:30:17.745\nToday it's owned by Oracle, and\ndevelopment for it has been really spotty.\n\n612\n00:30:17.745 --> 00:30:22.025\nSo most operating systems don't\nhave official ZFS support yet, but\n\n613\n00:30:22.025 --> 00:30:26.449\neverybody looks to it as the future,\nthat Linux is gonna move over to ZFS\n\n614\n00:30:26.449 --> 00:30:29.989\neventually, and\nMac OS may move over to ZFS eventually,\n\n615\n00:30:29.989 --> 00:30:33.356\nand all these Unix based\nsystems may move over to ZFS.\n\n616\n00:30:33.356 --> 00:30:35.072\nBut it's all may move over.\n\n617\n00:30:35.072 --> 00:30:38.022\nNone of them are doing it by default\nbecause there are certain data loss\n\n618\n00:30:38.022 --> 00:30:40.482\nscenarios that can happen,\nand that's always bad.\n\n619\n00:30:40.482 --> 00:30:45.160\nBut when it does make it into production,\n16EB maximum file size,\n\n620\n00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:50.578\njust like Windows, but\n256ZB maximum volume size.\n\n621\n00:30:50.578 --> 00:30:52.520\nAnd just kinda looking\nat all of these guys,\n\n622\n00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.300\nthat's the largest maximum volume\nsize of any of these file systems.\n\n623\n00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.430\nAnd that's why people are looking at this\nas the future, that it can get really,\n\n624\n00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:02.460\nreally big, and\nyou can really get some value out of that.\n\n625\n00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.660\nSo these are the different file systems.\n\n626\n00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:09.200\nWhen you create an array, it's a good\nidea to remember these file systems and\n\n627\n00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.410\ntheir limitations.\n\n628\n00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.210\nAnd usually you just don't wanna\nmake an array that's bigger than\n\n629\n00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.820\nthe maximum volume size of\nthe file system you're gonna use.\n\n630\n00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.140\nIf you do, you may start to have problems.\n\n631\n00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:18.940\nAnd I usually try and\n\n632\n00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.860\ngo well beneath the thresholds just to\nmake sure everything runs smooth, because\n\n633\n00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:27.790\nthe bigger that volume is, the more\naddressing space it requires on a system.\n\n634\n00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.320\nAnd while it usually takes account for\n\n635\n00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.230\nthat anyway, you can start ending\nup with weird scenarios where\n\n636\n00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:35.680\nyou cross these little thresholds and\nthe file systems don't work properly.\n\n637\n00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.720\nYou create a 15TB array, and\nthe the operating system sees it as 2TB,\n\n638\n00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.530\nbecause it screwed up some\nkind of memory addressing.\n\n639\n00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:43.410\nAnd that does happen,\n\n640\n00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:46.780\nso we've always got to remember those\nfile systems and what we're using.\n\n641\n00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.650\n>> That is definitely some news\nwe can use, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n642\n00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.960\nSo go through that chart, look at it, kind\nof that's one of those things you just\n\n643\n00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.190\nhave to brute-force memorize,\nunfortunately.\n\n644\n00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:58.800\nThat's just life sometimes,\nand this is that part.\n\n645\n00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.830\nSo go through that,\nmake sure you get good and\n\n646\n00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:05.420\nfamiliar with those different sizes,\nthe file sizes and the volume sizes and\n\n647\n00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.920\ntheir maximum capacities, so\nthat you're ready for the exam.\n\n648\n00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.690\nAnd when you get out there in real\nlife you know exactly what you'll want\n\n649\n00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:13.610\nto use in the environment that you're in.\n\n650\n00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.340\nDon, you've given us a lot\nof great information today.\n\n651\n00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.340\nIs there anything else you want to throw\non the pile before we close the show?\n\n652\n00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.320\n>> That's pretty much it.\n\n653\n00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.590\nAt this point we've talked\na lot about storage.\n\n654\n00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:22.830\nWe haven't actually configured any.\n\n655\n00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:26.100\nSo stay tuned, cuz in the next episode\nwe're gonna actually see configuring this\n\n656\n00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.100\nstuff on a SAN and kinda how that works.\n\n657\n00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.980\nBut we have to have all this base\nknowledge to make the right decisions when\n\n658\n00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.410\nit comes to configuration time.\n\n659\n00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:33.860\n>> All right, well,\nthank you so much, Don, for\n\n660\n00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.040\nshowing us this, and\nthank you guys for watching.\n\n661\n00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.570\nWe hope to see you in the next episode.\n\n662\n00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:41.110\nUntil then, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n663\n00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.858\n>> And I'm Don

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.320\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n4\n00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.450\nwe're continuing on with our\nCloud+ series for CompTIA.\n\n5\n00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.530\nJoining us back in the studio again today,\nhe is our guiding star.\n\n6\n00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.010\nThat is, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.580\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.600\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.960\nI'm ready to jump right\nback in to CompTIA Cloud+.\n\n10\n00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.920\nIn this episode, we're gonna take\na look at Cloud, or not Cloud,\n\n11\n00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.920\nwell it is Cloud I guess,\nbut SAN configuration.\n\n12\n00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.450\nIn our last few episodes,\nwe've talked a lot about storage.\n\n13\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.070\nBuying hard drives, how to pick them, how\nto, what a raider is we want set up and\n\n14\n00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.420\nall that good stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.010\nBut we haven't actually set\nthe things up at all, and so\n\n16\n00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.270\nI want to show you guys what it's like for\ngetting a SAN set up and configured, and\n\n17\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.640\nready for your machines to connect to.\n\n18\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.050\nAnd you'll see there's some\ninteresting stuff that's out there.\n\n19\n00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.950\nFor the most part,\nit's pretty straight forward.\n\n20\n00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.790\nAlmost every SAN these days has a\ngraphical user interface that you can use,\n\n21\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.470\nand so do the SAN switches.\n\n22\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.370\nThey usually have CLI also, but\nyou typically don't have to have it.\n\n23\n00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.710\nAnd for the most part, SANs are one of\nthe things where you configure it, and\n\n24\n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.090\nthen you never mess with it again,\nuntil you run out of storage space.\n\n25\n00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.100\nThen you have to add more disks.\n\n26\n00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.290\nSo they're pretty low maintenance devices,\nand you just get in and set the things up.\n\n27\n00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.930\nSo that's what we're going to take\na look at here in this episode.\n\n28\n00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.040\n>> Yeah, if you've been waiting with\nbated breath to actually see some SAN\n\n29\n00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.190\nconfiguration, this is the episode for\nyou.\n\n30\n00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.708\nWe are where the metal meets the meat.\n\n31\n00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:30.880\nWe're going to do that for you today,\nand it's really, really cool.\n\n32\n00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.780\nIt's a lot of fun.\n\n33\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.730\nFor me, this is the kind of\nthing that gets me into IT.\n\n34\n00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.400\nIt gets my IT beanie twirling.\n\n35\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.780\nSo, we'll just dispense\nwith the pleasantries, Don.\n\n36\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.580\nI'll let you go ahead and jump behind Mr.\n\n37\n00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.520\nCommand over here and\nshow us how to make this happen.\n\n38\n00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.020\n>> All right, well I know I brought this\nup in another episode at one point, but\n\n39\n00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.480\nI've got a little EMC SAN\npulled up right here.\n\n40\n00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.740\nAnd basically it a fairly typical device,\nand\n\n41\n00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.785\nif you've never worked with one of these,\nhere let me get into the health screens,\n\n42\n00:01:56.785 --> 00:01:59.460\nbecause you can see\na little picture of it.\n\n43\n00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.715\nand what the SAn actually\nlooks like Is this right here.\n\n44\n00:02:04.715 --> 00:02:05.305\nOkay?\n\n45\n00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:10.135\nSo, this is the SAN itself, and notice up\nhere, its saying Disk Processor Enclosure.\n\n46\n00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:13.345\nSo, this right here has\na processor in the back of it and\n\n47\n00:02:13.345 --> 00:02:15.602\nits actually running the show.\n\n48\n00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:17.922\nBuilt into it you'll see\nit's got these drives, and\n\n49\n00:02:17.922 --> 00:02:20.752\nwhat do we have here,\nit looks like 12 drives.\n\n50\n00:02:20.752 --> 00:02:23.732\nSo we've got 12 drives of capacity for it.\n\n51\n00:02:23.732 --> 00:02:26.282\nNow, whichever one is your\ndisk processor enclosure,\n\n52\n00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:30.552\nwhichever one is the main brain for\nyour unit, it's going to have disks, but\n\n53\n00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:33.280\nthey're not all available for you to use.\n\n54\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.960\nUsually a couple of them will be pooled\nto store the operating system of the SAN.\n\n55\n00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.540\nYour SAN has an operating system, and\nit needs drives to store that, and so\n\n56\n00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.800\nit'll normally pull three or\nfour drives aside for itself.\n\n57\n00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.890\nFour is pretty common, where it'll have\nthree in array and five array, and\n\n58\n00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.980\none as a spare that's available.\n\n59\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.250\nAnd you can normally spot spares, because\nit'll show grayed out like this, or\n\n60\n00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.930\non some SANs grayed out might\nindicate that it's an empty bay.\n\n61\n00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.390\nBut normally,\nthe graphic updates to show an empty bay.\n\n62\n00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.990\nSo this one's pretty full, and\nthat's the main enclosure.\n\n63\n00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.490\nThere's a second enclosure attached to\nthis right here, and you'll see this is\n\n64\n00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.130\nanother Disk Processor Enclosure,\nand this one has sideways drives.\n\n65\n00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.790\nThey don't have to be laid horizontal.\n\n66\n00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.050\nThey can be laid vertically like this, and\n\n67\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.850\nyou can get more disks in\nthere in this enclosure.\n\n68\n00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.160\nAnd these might be, I can't tell from the\npicture here if these are SAS or SATA or\n\n69\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160\nif they're SSD or physical spinning disks.\n\n70\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.780\nIt's hard to tell from the picture.\n\n71\n00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.350\nBut in this one you see\nthat drive density.\n\n72\n00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.210\nI haven't counted here, but\nit looks like maybe 30 disks.\n\n73\n00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.680\nNo it's a little bit less than 30.\n\n74\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.940\n>> 20 maybe?\n>> So probably 24 disks,\n\n75\n00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.370\nor somewhere like that\nspread in this array.\n\n76\n00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.490\nYou can have a lot of disks, and\n\n77\n00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.400\nas your SAN grows,\nyou just add more of these enclosures.\n\n78\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.600\nSo you might have a 42U rack that's packed\nfull of these enclosures right here,\n\n79\n00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.350\nand that's how you can get to 250 drives,\nor even 1,000 drives.\n\n80\n00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.400\nOn some SANs you can have really,\n\n81\n00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.130\nreally massive enclosures just\nby popping those disks in.\n\n82\n00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.860\nNow I'm looking at the front\nsides of these things, but\n\n83\n00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.890\nthe backside looks something like this.\n\n84\n00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.200\nThis is the one that had\nall the 30 drives in it.\n\n85\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.120\nAnd looking at the back you'll see\nall the different fans, right?\n\n86\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.930\nJust tons of fans to keep the drives cool,\nbut\n\n87\n00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.980\nthen you've got all these\nadapters down here.\n\n88\n00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.360\nAnd you may have a mixture\nlike I'm seeing here.\n\n89\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.470\nSome of these are just copper connectors.\n\n90\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.410\nAnd these might be if we're doing\nFiber Channel over Ethernet or\n\n91\n00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.880\nif we're doing iSCSI connectors, right?\n\n92\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.980\nWe just need regular Ethernet\nconnectors for that.\n\n93\n00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.640\nBut then there's fiber ones up here\nwhich are the Fiber Channel connectors,\n\n94\n00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.390\nif we're doing a Fiber Channel SANs.\n\n95\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.090\nAs I float over it you'll see it saying\nFC Port 0 and FC Port 1 and so on.\n\n96\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.890\nSo those are my Fiber Channel\nconnectors there.\n\n97\n00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.470\nWe'd plug those into our\nFiber Channel switches.\n\n98\n00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.620\nOr if we have less than four hosts,\nor less than five hosts I guess,\n\n99\n00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.670\nyou can take your hosts and\njust plug them right into this.\n\n100\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.510\nTake their HBAs and\nplug them right into the SAN, so\n\n101\n00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.540\nthat you could see what was going on, but\n\n102\n00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.490\nyou'll normally have either two or four of\nthese connectors available for that use.\n\n103\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.540\nAnd this system is redundant.\n\n104\n00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.910\nSo what I'm looking at here is on\nthe left side I've got one controller,\n\n105\n00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.830\nand there's these little plastic pull\ntabs where you can slide it out, but\n\n106\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.990\nthis is one controller right here.\n\n107\n00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.485\nAnd on the other side\nhere's another controller,\n\n108\n00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:06.715\ncompletely redundant controllers.\n\n109\n00:05:06.715 --> 00:05:09.035\nIf one controller fails,\nthe other takes over.\n\n110\n00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:10.685\nThey're both running in lock step.\n\n111\n00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.365\nA change going through one\nis going through the other.\n\n112\n00:05:12.365 --> 00:05:14.295\nYou can you can fail over from\none controller to another\n\n113\n00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:18.325\nwithout losing a single bit of data\nbeing written, and its amazing, right?\n\n114\n00:05:18.325 --> 00:05:20.260\nSo that's a lot of redundancy.\n\n115\n00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.425\nWe'd obviously want to combine that\nwith multiple switches and multiple\n\n116\n00:05:24.425 --> 00:05:28.210\nHPA's in our computer, in our servers,\nso that we get full redundancy and\n\n117\n00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.450\nwhat's called multi-pathing, or multi-path\nIO, MPIO, where you have two HBAs.\n\n118\n00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.090\nThey run to two different switches\nthat run to two different controllers\n\n119\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.490\non this SAN, completely independent\npaths to get to the same destination and\n\n120\n00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.650\nthe same disks.\n\n121\n00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.570\nAll right,\nthat's the back of this enclosure.\n\n122\n00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.250\nLet me show you the back of the other one.\n\n123\n00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.410\nIt's similar.\n\n124\n00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.610\nWhen we look at the back of the other one,\nnot as flashy on this one,\n\n125\n00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.260\nbecause this one is just disks.\n\n126\n00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.090\nAnd so I've got a controller over here,\na controller over here, and\n\n127\n00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.810\nwe've got some kind of proprietary\nconnector here for daisy chaining.\n\n128\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.750\nAnd these actually pop out too, so you can\npop these boards out and add cards that\n\n129\n00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.280\nhave fiber, or Ethernet, or whatever\nit is that you need attached to it.\n\n130\n00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.430\nYou'll often see where the back panels\nare modular for this particular reason.\n\n131\n00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.410\nIn fact, as I look closer at that, I said\nthis was a CPU up top, but I think that\n\n132\n00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.910\nmight actually be the power supply, since\nyou've got the power plug right on it.\n\n133\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.400\nThis might be a removable power supply,\nand then the controller's down here, so\n\n134\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.220\nI might have that backwards on that one.\n\n135\n00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.130\nBut that's kind of an idea of what\nthe physical SAN equipment looks like,\n\n136\n00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.640\nand here I've just got the main drive and\na enclosure attached to it, but\n\n137\n00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.760\nyou may have many, many enclosures.\n\n138\n00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.070\nYou may have more than one processor.\n\n139\n00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.880\nIt just depends on your environment.\n\n140\n00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.950\nBut when you boot the thing up for\nthe first time,\n\n141\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.500\nit's going to come up, and you're\ngoing start to see disks inside of it.\n\n142\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.699\nAnd those disks aren't really\nconfigured for anything.\n\n143\n00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:45.220\nThey're just sitting there.\n\n144\n00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.570\nAnd it's up to us to go and\n\n145\n00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.990\nslice up these disks and make them\navailable to our systems, all right?\n\n146\n00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.400\nSo when I go over here to storage, that's\nwhere my work's really going to begin,\n\n147\n00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.730\nto jump in here and\nstart to configure things.\n\n148\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.640\nAnd you'll see that I've got\na storage configuration,\n\n149\n00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.830\nand then I've got something called LUNs.\n\n150\n00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.000\nMy physical disks.\n\n151\n00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.300\nThose are physical hard drives, and\nif they're SASS then they're running as\n\n152\n00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.780\nserial attached SCSI and they've got SCSI\nID's that identify each disk individually.\n\n153\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.353\nBut when I connect my host to this,\n\n154\n00:07:14.353 --> 00:07:16.590\nthey're not going to see\nthe individual disks.\n\n155\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.740\nWe're going to build rate arrays.\n\n156\n00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.113\nWe're going to build containers\nthat wrap up these disks,\n\n157\n00:07:20.113 --> 00:07:22.430\nand that's what my hosts are going to see.\n\n158\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.840\nAnd those containers,\nthey're not real drives.\n\n159\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.600\nThey're virtual drives that span\nmultiple physical drives, and so\n\n160\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.040\nthey need an identifier.\n\n161\n00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.830\nAnd they're all going to be assigned\nlogical unit numbers, or LUNs, L-U-Ns.\n\n162\n00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.670\nAnd those LUNs help us tell\none container from another, so\n\n163\n00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.360\nI can say this container\nis tied to web server one.\n\n164\n00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.310\nThis other container is\ntied to web server five.\n\n165\n00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.819\nOne has a LUN ID of zero, the other has\na LUN ID of four, so I map those out,\n\n166\n00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:51.340\nso I know which server goes where.\n\n167\n00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.731\nIt's how we tell things apart.\n\n168\n00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:56.861\nIf I jump into LUNs on a brand new SAN,\nI'm not going to see much of anything.\n\n169\n00:07:56.861 --> 00:07:59.071\nI need to get the storage\nconfiguration done first, and\n\n170\n00:07:59.071 --> 00:08:01.360\nthen I can start creating\nLUNs on top of it.\n\n171\n00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.300\nSome SANs, like this one,\nactually do it both at the same time.\n\n172\n00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.520\nYou create the LUN and it creates\nthe underlying array at the same time.\n\n173\n00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.010\nOther SANs might have you do\nit as two separate steps.\n\n174\n00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.390\nThere's a lot of older Dell stuff before\nthey partnered with EMC Where you had to\n\n175\n00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.560\ndo it in two separate stages.\n\n176\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.450\nSo if I go in to storage configurations,\n\n177\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.390\nhere's where I can start\nto create storage pools.\n\n178\n00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.300\nAnd those storage pools, that's where\nwe're collecting those disks together and\n\n179\n00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.190\nbuilding an array, right?\n\n180\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.330\nAnd we can have LUNs inside of that array.\n\n181\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.590\nYou can have one big LUN that covers the\nwhole array, or you can take the array and\n\n182\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.640\ndivide it up into multiple LUNs so\nit'll look to the host like multiple hard\n\n183\n00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.320\ndrives, even though it's built on top of\nthe same physical drives on the backend.\n\n184\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.140\nAnd you always wanna have a couple\nof spare disks laying around.\n\n185\n00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.000\nIf you have a RAID 5 array, a RAID 10,\n\n186\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.350\nand a drive fails,\nyou can rebuild the failed drive.\n\n187\n00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.690\nAnd if you have a spare\nalready inserted in the SAN,\n\n188\n00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.460\nit can start the rebuild\nwithout you getting involved.\n\n189\n00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.300\nSo you get an email saying,\nhey, I had a drive fail.\n\n190\n00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.480\nGreat, it's rebuilding.\n\n191\n00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.290\nI need to order a replacement\nwhen I get a chance.\n\n192\n00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.184\nBut it's already rebuilding.\n\n193\n00:09:00.184 --> 00:09:02.290\nI don't know if you rush to the office and\nswap in a drive,\n\n194\n00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.400\nlike we used to when we had\nall the physical servers.\n\n195\n00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.070\nNow, it just rebuilds and that's that, and\nit'll send you an email when it's done.\n\n196\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.460\nSo it's kind of nice to have that.\n\n197\n00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.300\nYou may or may not have spare disks.\n\n198\n00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.970\nIf you're using all of your disks,\nyou don't have a spare, preferably you do.\n\n199\n00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.430\nSo I could jump in here, and\nI could configure my spare disks, and\n\n200\n00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.160\nbasically I would pick the disks that\nI wanted to be spare, and right now,\n\n201\n00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.020\nI don't really have any.\n\n202\n00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.960\nAll these are actually already allocated.\n\n203\n00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.950\nSo we could define that, and you can\ndefine hot spare policies on this SAN to\n\n204\n00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:34.620\nsay, if I put 12 disks in an array,\ngo ahead and keep one as a spare.\n\n205\n00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.595\nAnd it'll make it and use it, and you'll\nsee that's what I've got defined here.\n\n206\n00:09:37.595 --> 00:09:41.620\n12 disks in my flash, and\nI wanna have one as a spare.\n\n207\n00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.330\nI've got 11 disks in my SAS array,\nmy first SAS array, and\n\n208\n00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.810\n13 in my other SAS array.\n\n209\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.720\nAnd I want one spare in each of those.\n\n210\n00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.290\nAnd so,\nit's gonna build that kind of solution.\n\n211\n00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.360\nAll right, so next if we're not gonna\nset any spares, or you flag spares for\n\n212\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.270\nwhatever you need.\n\n213\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.470\nBut everything that's left is\ngonna go into a storage pool.\n\n214\n00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.870\nAnd so when we go into a storage pool,\n\n215\n00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:06.660\nthis is where we collect our physical hard\ndrives together and make an array, right?\n\n216\n00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.400\nAnd so I'm just going under\nmy storage pools here.\n\n217\n00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.760\nI'm gonna go down to Create, and\nit's gonna ask me to create a new pool.\n\n218\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.190\nAnd I can give it a name.\n\n219\n00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.440\nAnd so you usually want to name it based\non what this resource is going to be.\n\n220\n00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.530\nSo maybe this is going to be storage for\nWeb01.\n\n221\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.410\nAnd so I'm gonna create that order,\nor maybe this is shared for\n\n222\n00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.080\nmore than one thing so I might create\nan entry called Web Servers or whatever.\n\n223\n00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.910\nIt just depends on how you\nwanna divide this data up.\n\n224\n00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.240\nI'll call it Web01, this is to give\nme storage just for a web server, or\n\n225\n00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.080\nmaybe as a database.\n\n226\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.090\nAll right, let's do databases, so DB01.\n\n227\n00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.370\nThen, it's gonna ask me for\n\n228\n00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.030\nadditional information about what\nstorage tier this is gonna be,\n\n229\n00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.590\nwhat type of drives I wanna give it, and\nthen how I wanna assign those drives.\n\n230\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:47.158\nNow, I've got three different\ntypes of drives in my system.\n\n231\n00:10:47.158 --> 00:10:52.220\nI've got Flash, I've got SAS,\nand I've got lower capacity SAS.\n\n232\n00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.610\nSo something of our SAS is at 10,000\nRPM and some of it's at 7,200 RPM.\n\n233\n00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.040\nSo that's my higher and\nlower capacity SAS.\n\n234\n00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.510\nSo this is a database.\n\n235\n00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.410\nThis is really important\nto me that this be fast.\n\n236\n00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.550\nI want this to be the fastest\nSAS as possible, so\n\n237\n00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:08.010\nI might choose to put it in\nmy extreme performance tier.\n\n238\n00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.750\nAnd when I choose that,\nnotice what it's suggesting down here.\n\n239\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.530\nLet's do RAID 5, okay?\n\n240\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.340\nAnd, it's saying do 4 + 1.\n\n241\n00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.900\nYou're gonna do stripes with parity,\nright?\n\n242\n00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.960\nAnd, we'll get a usable capacity\nof 733 gigs across these\n\n243\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.870\ndisks that I'm gonna appropriate to it,\nokay?\n\n244\n00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.480\nNow, I don't have to do RAID\n5 like they're suggesting.\n\n245\n00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.380\nI can hit Change, and now I can come\nthrough, and I can pick what I want.\n\n246\n00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.870\nAnd, they're gonna show\nme what's available.\n\n247\n00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.440\nI don't get every RAID type available.\n\n248\n00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.720\nI can't choose RAID 1 or RAID 0,\nthey're not giving me those options.\n\n249\n00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.040\nI can do RAID 5 or RAID 6.\n\n250\n00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.010\nNotice on RAID 5,\nits got me with 733 GB available.\n\n251\n00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.620\nIf I go down to RAID 6,\nit goes up to 1 TB.\n\n252\n00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.690\nWhat happened there?\n\n253\n00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.380\nWell, usually it's an indicator that\nI ran out of drives in one tier and\n\n254\n00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.920\nit's moving me to another tier so\nI ended up with more storage.\n\n255\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.270\nBut, you can end up with\ndifferent things sometimes.\n\n256\n00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.710\nBut also the quantity of disks\nwill affect that sometimes too.\n\n257\n00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:05.810\nOr I can go RAID 10 and RAID 10 I drop\nback down to 733 gigs of storage 4+4.\n\n258\n00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:11.970\nFour drives in a stripe, four more drives\nin a stripe mirrored together, my RAID 10.\n\n259\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.940\nOr actually, it would be four mirrors and\nthen stripes, either way.\n\n260\n00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n261\n00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.590\nhere's where I can choose that RAID level,\nand\n\n262\n00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.790\nit's gonna be up to me to\ndetermine what I want.\n\n263\n00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.850\nFor a database,\nI'm normally concerned about performance.\n\n264\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.210\nI want reads and\nwrites to happen as fast as possible.\n\n265\n00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:30.450\nAnd while RAID 5 and RAID 6 are nice, RAID\n10 is gonna give me the best performance.\n\n266\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:34.140\nI lose some storage, I can get\na terabyte of storage doing RAID 6,\n\n267\n00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.340\nbut doing RAID 10 I get less\nstorage in exchange for\n\n268\n00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.080\nbetter performance, better speed and\nincreased redundancy.\n\n269\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.650\n>> It all comes back down to what\nis it you're looking to do, and\n\n270\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.340\nthen you choose the correct RAID level for\nthat environment.\n\n271\n00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.870\n>> Absolutely, yep.\n\n272\n00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.930\nSo I'm gonna say okay to that,\nI'm gonna stick with RAID 10.\n\n273\n00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.160\nAnd we'll move forward.\n\n274\n00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.100\nAnd I can even add more than one tier.\n\n275\n00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.700\nIf I'm doing a multi-tiered policy,\nwhere I want frequently used data to go in\n\n276\n00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.090\nthe high tier and infrequently\nused data to go in the low tier,\n\n277\n00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.590\nthen I would choose more\nthan one thing here.\n\n278\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.460\nAnd my pool would encompass\ndrives from more than one array.\n\n279\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.390\nBut I want a database server.\n\n280\n00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.940\nI want it to be fast all the time so\nI don't want extra tiers.\n\n281\n00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.210\nSo I'll leave that and I'll hit Next.\n\n282\n00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.780\nAnd now it's looking at the available\ndisks to figure out whether it can do\n\n283\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.240\nwhat I'm asking it to do.\n\n284\n00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.040\nAnd so see here how it's looking\nat a found I had SAS disks\n\n285\n00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.670\nthat were 200 GB each.\n\n286\n00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.550\nAnd it's gonna use eight of my ten\navailable disks and it's gonna get me 733\n\n287\n00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.880\ngigs of storage, but I can choose other\noptions apparently like using none.\n\n288\n00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.110\nIf I had more than one tier here's\nwhere I'd pick my different tiers.\n\n289\n00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.480\nI'm gonna be stuck with the eight.\n\n290\n00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.080\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n291\n00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.590\nit told me it was going\nto do four plus four,\n\n292\n00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.789\nand that's where it's getting\nthat eight number from.\n\n293\n00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.710\nSometimes you don't get a lot\nof flexibility on this stuff.\n\n294\n00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.870\nAll right, so then I get my summary for\n\n295\n00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:49.930\nwhat it's going to create, I should end up\nwith a 733 gig drive that's using Raid 10\n\n296\n00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.700\nthat's built entirely on my slash disks,\nmy SSD.\n\n297\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.740\nAnd once that pull is done,\nit's created and ready to rock.\n\n298\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.090\nAnd see how it's creating a storage pull?\n\n299\n00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.720\nThat's the collection of physical disks.\n\n300\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.090\nIt just set aside eight physical disks,\nand\n\n301\n00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.660\nthen it created a RAID\ngroup on top of them.\n\n302\n00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.280\nSo now I've got a RAID array laying\non top and it's called DB01.\n\n303\n00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.600\nOkay, so my job is complete.\n\n304\n00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.410\nI can close that window.\n\n305\n00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.690\nAnd now I've got my two pools.\n\n306\n00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.520\nI've got this multi-tier pool which\nis the one we saw in another episode.\n\n307\n00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.370\nSo it's sitting there at 10 TB, and\nit's got more than one tier of storage.\n\n308\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.720\nBut now I got my database tier that's\nup and going and it's ready to rock.\n\n309\n00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.130\nNow notice my used space.\n\n310\n00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.380\nI just created this.\n\n311\n00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.100\nHow do I have use space already,\nhow am I eating up some of this?\n\n312\n00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.660\nWell, a lot of times this will\nreflect some of the mirror usage.\n\n313\n00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.190\nSometimes it'll be the data that's\nput on it, but in reality here,\n\n314\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.410\nI'm using a pre-staged database on the\nback end, so it's showing fake data on it.\n\n315\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.480\nSo normally this would come up and\nit would be 0% used.\n\n316\n00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.610\n>> Now, Don, once we have a LUN put in\nplace, it's storage, it's allocated,\n\n317\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.490\nit's ready to go.\n\n318\n00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.960\nHow do I get my operating systems and\n\n319\n00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.330\nthings of that nature to\nstart using that storage?\n\n320\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.090\nI mean it's on a separate device.\n\n321\n00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.450\n>> It's funny you mention the LUN,\ntechnically I haven't created a LUN yet.\n\n322\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.365\nThat's right.\n\n323\n00:15:05.365 --> 00:15:07.600\n[LAUGH]\n>> I've created an array, and\n\n324\n00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.160\nthe array has physical disks in it,\nand it's running RAID 10.\n\n325\n00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.885\nI need to slice up that array into LUNs.\n\n326\n00:15:11.885 --> 00:15:14.454\nAnd I can create one big LUN\nto cover the whole thing,\n\n327\n00:15:14.454 --> 00:15:18.772\nor I can create several smaller LUNs that\nwere just little chunks taken out of it.\n\n328\n00:15:18.772 --> 00:15:22.910\nThat depends on what I need, cuz I\nprobably need an operating system drive,\n\n329\n00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.860\nand I probably need a database drive,\ntransaction logs, and so on, and\n\n330\n00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.730\nI might wanna slice all\nof them out of this.\n\n331\n00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.810\nNow, I did Raid 10, and Raid 10 is\ngreat for some things and not great for\n\n332\n00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.257\nother things, so I might wanna\ncreate more than one array here,\n\n333\n00:15:35.257 --> 00:15:38.940\nmore than one of these storage\npools to then divvy up.\n\n334\n00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.540\nBut if I just wanna slice\nit right out of the one,\n\n335\n00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.420\nmy next step is gonna\nbe to create some LUNs.\n\n336\n00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.430\nNow when I go back to storage, let me\njust jump back to my storage screen and\n\n337\n00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.020\ngo under LUNs.\n\n338\n00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.713\nHere I am, and I could see I've got some\nLUN groups from something else before.\n\n339\n00:15:50.713 --> 00:15:55.123\nI'm gonna create a new LUN group, and\nso I'll call this LUN Group DB 01.\n\n340\n00:15:55.123 --> 00:15:57.890\nSo this is gonna be the LUN group for\ndatabase 01.\n\n341\n00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.192\nI'm not creating a LUN,\n\n342\n00:15:59.192 --> 00:16:02.360\nI'm creating a group cuz I wanna\ngroup these guys together.\n\n343\n00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.020\nAnd the reason we wanna group them\ntogether is usually for security purpose.\n\n344\n00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.990\nI can grant access to more than one\ndrive all at the same time by having\n\n345\n00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:11.470\na group in place.\n\n346\n00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:16.570\nAnd now it's offering for me to create or\nmore LUNs in the group, right?\n\n347\n00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:17.730\nAnd here's where I can jump through.\n\n348\n00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.110\nAnd I can pick my storage\npool that I made.\n\n349\n00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.100\nAnd I can tell it my tiering policy,\nif I've got multiple tiers, I don't, so\n\n350\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.370\nthis doesn't matter.\n\n351\n00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.860\nAnd then I can specify the size\nof the LUN I wanna create.\n\n352\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.680\nAnd so\nI might wanna create a 64 GB LUN for\n\n353\n00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.396\nDB01s, I'll just call it DB01-OS, and\n\n354\n00:16:36.396 --> 00:16:41.900\nI'll call this\nthe DB01 Operating System Partition.\n\n355\n00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.340\nRight, that's where I want\nthe operating system to be.\n\n356\n00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.810\nI'm just gonna do 64 gigs.\n\n357\n00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.280\nAnd look at this.\n\n358\n00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.090\nThin provisioning.\n\n359\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.640\nWatch out for that.\n\n360\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.160\nThin provisioning is great in\ntest in dev and whatever, but\n\n361\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.170\nin production,\nI wanna layout the storage right now.\n\n362\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.530\nWe've talked about that in other episodes.\n\n363\n00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.290\nIt's important.\n\n364\n00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.620\nI'm gonna uncheck that.\n\n365\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.340\nI don't want thin provisioning.\n\n366\n00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.910\nAnd then right down here I can see\nthe logical unit number it's gonna assign.\n\n367\n00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.200\nIt's gonna give it a one.\n\n368\n00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.110\nAnd I'm gonna add that in, okay.\n\n369\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.800\nNow that's just one.\n\n370\n00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.390\nI'm gonna continue and add some more.\n\n371\n00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.930\nMaybe I want another 64 gig partition,\n\n372\n00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:16.340\nwhich I'm gonna make Database\n01's transaction log partition.\n\n373\n00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:22.070\nSo I want to store my transaction logs on\na separate partition from the other ones.\n\n374\n00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.420\nThis is a pretty common thing\nwhen you configure data.\n\n375\n00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.720\nShoot.\n[LAUGH] Wasn't paying attention, and\n\n376\n00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.090\nI just added it with an ID of 1.\n\n377\n00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:29.560\nWas it smart enough to fix that for me?\n\n378\n00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.590\nNo, all right, let me remove that.\n\n379\n00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:33.430\nAnd we'll try that again.\n\n380\n00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.530\nSo I'm gonna add it.\n\n381\n00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:36.400\nActually, you know what?\n\n382\n00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.786\nThat's not the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n383\n00:17:37.786 --> 00:17:38.901\nIt's how many I'm adding.\n\n384\n00:17:38.901 --> 00:17:41.030\nAll right, it must dynamically\nassign the LUN numbers.\n\n385\n00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.210\nWell, we'll see the LUN\nnumbers in a minute.\n\n386\n00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:43.670\nI guess I interpreted that wrong.\n\n387\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.700\nI thought that was the LUN number.\n\n388\n00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.920\nBut, so I'll remove that.\n\n389\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.420\nAnd now let me go ahead and\nadd in one more for the database.\n\n390\n00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.010\nAnd how much storage do I\nhave left on this thing?\n\n391\n00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:53.530\nNot a ton.\n\n392\n00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:58.210\nSo maybe I'll do just 250 gigs for\nthe database, and\n\n393\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.981\nI'll just say that this is\nDB01's database partition.\n\n394\n00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.150\nThere we go, and I'll go ahead and\nadd that in there.\n\n395\n00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.870\nSo now, what I've created are three LUNs,\n\n396\n00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.800\nthree logical unit numbers\ninside of this one array.\n\n397\n00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.180\nNow I'm gonna have extra space\navailable inside of there and\n\n398\n00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.750\nthat's a good thing because\na lot of SAN supports snapshots.\n\n399\n00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.540\nAnd if you want to do snapshots you\nhave to have extra room in there to\n\n400\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.020\nuse the snapshots.\n\n401\n00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.830\nWe talked about snapshots in\nan earlier episode as they pertain to\n\n402\n00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.230\nyour hypervisor.\n\n403\n00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.120\nSnapshots in the SAN are a lot different,\n\n404\n00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.150\nbecause they're doing a snapshot\nof the actual raw storage.\n\n405\n00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.540\nThey don't even know what\nthe operating system is.\n\n406\n00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.220\nThey don't care.\n\n407\n00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.440\nIt's 1s and 0s to it.\n\n408\n00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.380\nSo, it's a very different\ntype of snapshot.\n\n409\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.530\nAnd, they're not as flexible as\nthe snapshots that we take with our\n\n410\n00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.600\nvirtual machines.\n\n411\n00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.760\nBecause, with our virtual machines, we can\nmigrate a VM from one server to another,\n\n412\n00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.250\nand the snapshot follows it.\n\n413\n00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.860\nHere the snapshot is tied to this SAN, so\n\n414\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.600\nif I move a VM to another SAN I lose\nthe snapshot, so they're not as flexible.\n\n415\n00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.700\nI don't normally use them but\nthat functionality is there.\n\n416\n00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.920\nSo now I've created a couple\nof LUNs inside of this, and\n\n417\n00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.110\nI'll just move forward.\n\n418\n00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.040\nIt's asking if I want to\nconfigure a snapshot schedule.\n\n419\n00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.120\nThere's the snapshots I mentioned.\n\n420\n00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.400\nI'm not gonna do snapshots on it.\n\n421\n00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.010\nAnd then we'll just head forward.\n\n422\n00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:09.970\nAnd that should be everything.\n\n423\n00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.690\nThis is the important part, right?\n\n424\n00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:18.300\nPermissions, when we create LUNs, we\nlikely wanna restrict who can access them.\n\n425\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.155\nI created a group, which is cool, because\nnow I can set the permissions at the group\n\n426\n00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:23.855\nlevel and\nall of the drives will be affected.\n\n427\n00:19:23.855 --> 00:19:27.645\nI don't have to go to each individual\ndrive to configure permissions.\n\n428\n00:19:27.645 --> 00:19:31.625\nSo what this screen is doing is\nit's showing me the four systems\n\n429\n00:19:31.625 --> 00:19:33.055\nthat are connected to my SAN right now.\n\n430\n00:19:33.055 --> 00:19:36.605\nI've got two ESXI servers,\none Windows 7 machine, and\n\n431\n00:19:36.605 --> 00:19:38.250\none Windows server 2008 machine.\n\n432\n00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:38.930\nAlright.\n\n433\n00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:44.160\nAnd you'll notice that one of my ESS boxes\nare connected via iSCSI and fiber channel.\n\n434\n00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.510\nAnd file sharing which\nreally doesn't count.\n\n435\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.570\nAnd then we've got everything else which\nis just connected with iSCSI right?\n\n436\n00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.330\nSo when I go in and\nconfigure this, I can grant or\n\n437\n00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.760\ntake away their access based on protocol.\n\n438\n00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.750\nSo this ESX server, maybe I wanna allow it\nto connect via fiber channel or iSCSI, and\n\n439\n00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:05.720\nI'll let them connect to the LUN, or the\nsnapshots, or the LUN and the snapshots,\n\n440\n00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.030\ndepending on what I'm trying to achieve.\n\n441\n00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.830\nI'm gonna give it access just to the LUN,\ncuz I'm not using snapshots.\n\n442\n00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.460\nThese other guys,\nthe other ESX box or whatever,\n\n443\n00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.470\nI might not want them to\nhave any access at all.\n\n444\n00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.410\nAnd so I just don't grant it, right?\n\n445\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.060\nAnd so I can come in and specify that.\n\n446\n00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.510\nI'll just leave them at no access.\n\n447\n00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:24.670\nNow just this host is going\nto be able to access it.\n\n448\n00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.500\nNow, how are we identifying that host?\n\n449\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.080\nWell, via IP address, right here.\n\n450\n00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.790\nBut there's a few other ways we can\nidentify a host I wanna show you guys\n\n451\n00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:31.830\nhere in a minute.\n\n452\n00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.980\nBut basically,\nwe're restricting that access.\n\n453\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.620\nAnd that's really important, right?\n\n454\n00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.470\nWe don't necessarily want more than one\nperson accessing the same LUN cuz we can\n\n455\n00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.660\nget data corruption.\n\n456\n00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.130\nNow if it's a cluster, it's okay.\n\n457\n00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.240\nIf I've got two ESX servers in a cluster,\nit's all right for them to see the same\n\n458\n00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.450\nstorage cuz they all handle making sure\nthey don't write at the same time.\n\n459\n00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:50.800\nBut if I take this Windows 7 machine in\nthere, it doesn't check for anything.\n\n460\n00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.070\nIt just writes and your data gets lost.\n\n461\n00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.930\nSo I'm gonna restrict that access\ndoing it right here on the SAN.\n\n462\n00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.340\nWhen I move forward,\nthat should be all it needs.\n\n463\n00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.500\nThere we go.\nI can finish that up, and\n\n464\n00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.430\nnow I've got LUNs.\n\n465\n00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:09.470\nAnd now if I were to go to that EXX box\nthat I gave permission, if I go to in and\n\n466\n00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.600\nI pull up its disk management,\nand I go in and\n\n467\n00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.330\nlook, it'll see these three\nLUNs that I just created.\n\n468\n00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:20.340\nIt's see a 64 gig drive,\nanother 64 gig drive and a 250 gig drive.\n\n469\n00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.660\nAnd if it was the database sever,\nI would just start using those disks.\n\n470\n00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.910\nBut it's a virtual machine host.\n\n471\n00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.961\nSo, for a virtual machine host, what you\nnormally do is create one really big LUN,\n\n472\n00:21:29.961 --> 00:21:32.040\nand you expose it to\nthe virtual machine host.\n\n473\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.900\nAnd you tell it hey,\nstore your virtual hard drives here, and\n\n474\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.000\nthat's where its starts to\nput the virtual hard drives.\n\n475\n00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.690\nSo if you're doing virtualization,\nif you've got EFX or\n\n476\n00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:43.650\nwhatever, you're likely to have one\nbig fat LUN as big as you can make it,\n\n477\n00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.460\nand have your hyper visor\nstill recognize it.\n\n478\n00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.430\nRemember I talked about file systems in\nthe last episode, as big is you can go.\n\n479\n00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:54.110\nBut if you're connecting actual servers,\nlike a database sever to this,\n\n480\n00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:57.630\nthen I would create the individual ones\nlike I just did and get that allocated.\n\n481\n00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.040\nSo it's really about how you would use it.\n\n482\n00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.520\nAnd you can mix and match certainly, based\non the amount of drives that you have.\n\n483\n00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:07.910\nAll right, now everything that I did right\nthere was done on the SAN itself, right?\n\n484\n00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:12.210\nI created the group, I created the drives,\nI set the permissions for that group, so\n\n485\n00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.740\nthat people could access it.\n\n486\n00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.580\nAnd now we turn it loose and\nwe let people into it.\n\n487\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.980\nBut the security side can be\nbetter handled on your switch.\n\n488\n00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.587\nIf you got fiber channel and you plug\nin the systems right into your SAN,\n\n489\n00:22:25.587 --> 00:22:27.813\nremember we saw that\nin the very beginning,\n\n490\n00:22:27.813 --> 00:22:31.682\nI went into my dashboard and showed you\nwhere I had ports on the back of my SAN.\n\n491\n00:22:33.202 --> 00:22:35.870\nWhere I can plug fiber\nright into the back.\n\n492\n00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.880\nIf that's the case, the only way I\ncan restrict access is through those\n\n493\n00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.080\npermissions that you guys just saw.\n\n494\n00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.670\nThat was built into the SAN.\n\n495\n00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:47.345\nBut if I've got a fiber switch,\npretty much everything\n\n496\n00:22:47.345 --> 00:22:51.610\nSAN fiber switch has security features\nbuilt into it that we need to understand.\n\n497\n00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.610\nAnd I want to show you guys those so\nthat you got a good understanding of it.\n\n498\n00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.200\nAnd let me pull up,\nI got a little diagram I wanna show you.\n\n499\n00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.500\nThere's two main\ntechnologies that we have.\n\n500\n00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.980\nI think I mentioned VSANS in another\nepisode where you basically take your\n\n501\n00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.610\nports and you divide them up and\ncreate what are called virtual SANS.\n\n502\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:12.240\nA virtual SAN is where I might have\nmore than one physical SAN plugged into\n\n503\n00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:18.950\nthe switch, but I divide them up\ninto many different virtual SANs.\n\n504\n00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:23.110\nAnd a virtual SAN might contain a LUN from\none array, and a LUN from a completely\n\n505\n00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:27.840\ndifferent SAN, but when my host come to\naccess it, they just see these two drives.\n\n506\n00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.160\nAnd they see it as one SAN.\n\n507\n00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.560\nThey don't even realize there's\nmore than one SAN out there.\n\n508\n00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.059\nIt completely hides the SAN infrastructure\nand that's called a virtual SAN or a VSAN.\n\n509\n00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.460\nA similar technology to that\nis what's called zoning,\n\n510\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.480\nexcept zoning really only\nworks across a single SAN.\n\n511\n00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.355\nWhen you have zoning, what you do on your\nswitch is you take your SAN and you plug\n\n512\n00:23:46.355 --> 00:23:50.380\nit into the fiber switch, and you plug\neach of your hosts into that fiber switch.\n\n513\n00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.528\nAnd these might be virtual\nmachines running on a host,\n\n514\n00:23:52.528 --> 00:23:54.920\ncuz remember virtual machines\nyou can give dedicated HBAs.\n\n515\n00:23:54.920 --> 00:24:01.226\nAnd on the switch You come in and\nyou start to set little designators,\n\n516\n00:24:01.226 --> 00:24:07.660\nlittle indicators as to what you're\ngonna allow to see what, right?\n\n517\n00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.490\nSo let me get a nice flashy color here,\nlike purple, so I can write on this.\n\n518\n00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:17.496\nAnd basically the way this\nis gonna work is when,\n\n519\n00:24:17.496 --> 00:24:22.779\nI'm totally messing this up, aren't I?\n\n520\n00:24:22.779 --> 00:24:23.290\nWhere's my pencil?\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n521\n00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:24.418\n>> I can do a LUN, but\nnot do simple diagrams.\n\n522\n00:24:24.418 --> 00:24:24.970\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know,\n\n523\n00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:26.670\nyou give me a pencil and\nI go crazy, all right.\n\n524\n00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:28.520\nSo, let's say I create a zone.\n\n525\n00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:35.120\nI might create a zone and I say this\nhard drive right here is in a zone.\n\n526\n00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.940\nAnd then I put WEB01 in the same zone.\n\n527\n00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.200\nWhen it plugs in,\nall it sees is that one hard drive.\n\n528\n00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.200\nI'm dictating exactly what it can\nsee by placing it into a zone.\n\n529\n00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.610\nAnd I can start to create\nmore zones based on my needs\n\n530\n00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:53.990\nI might have a database server here,\nthat needs to see two drives.\n\n531\n00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:57.940\nAnd so I put those two drives in a zone,\nthis is getting bad.\n\n532\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.060\nAnd so we start zoning these out.\n\n533\n00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.270\nThe SAN isn't doing the zone,\nthe switch is.\n\n534\n00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.730\nAnd a lot of times the switch\ncan be aware of the SAN and so\n\n535\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.440\nit can take action with that.\n\n536\n00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.280\nBut a VSAN, a virtual SAN,\nis very similar,\n\n537\n00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.270\nlet's us divide up our connections to\nlimit which drives are visible to our\n\n538\n00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:18.140\nhosts based on usually what\nport they're plugged into.\n\n539\n00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.840\nAnd zoning can do the same thing\nby dividing up those ports, but\n\n540\n00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.610\na VSAN can hide more than one SAN\nbehind it, very similar technologies.\n\n541\n00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.280\nThere is one more method we can use,\nwhich is called LUN masking.\n\n542\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.970\nLUN masking can usually\nbe done on the SAN, or\n\n543\n00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.100\nit can be done on the Fiber Switch.\n\n544\n00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.970\nAnd, I just did it on\nthe SAN a minute ago.\n\n545\n00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:39.300\nWhen I created the LUN, I was able\nto pick who was allowed to see it.\n\n546\n00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.020\nIf you're not in that list,\nit'll hide that LUN from you, all right?\n\n547\n00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.420\nSo really easy to do.\n\n548\n00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.560\nAnd you can do it on a switch too.\n\n549\n00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.450\nYou can come in, and you can say these\nLUNs are only visible to these hosts,\n\n550\n00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.290\nyou create access control lists.\n\n551\n00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:54.060\nThe problem with LUN masking\nis it's tied to an ID number.\n\n552\n00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.770\nAnd it used to be tied to\nthe ID number of the HBA, so\n\n553\n00:25:56.770 --> 00:26:00.310\nwhen you have a host bus adapter in\nsomething like this WEB01 server.\n\n554\n00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:03.180\nIf I have a host bus adapter in it,\nit would have an identifier.\n\n555\n00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.480\nAnd the problem was people\ncould spoof the identifier.\n\n556\n00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.160\nYou could have more than one identifier.\n\n557\n00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.060\nI think I talked about that\nin another episode too.\n\n558\n00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.670\nBut people could spoof it.\n\n559\n00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.280\nAnd, so if an attacker broke into WEB01,\nthey could just start trying\n\n560\n00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.490\nrandom numbers until maybe they hit on\none, and started seeing other drives.\n\n561\n00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.450\nAnd, now they could access drives for\nanother system.\n\n562\n00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:20.790\nAnd, that's really bad.\n\n563\n00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.890\nAnd, so LUN masking has kind of gone away,\nwe don't see LUN masking as much any more.\n\n564\n00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.250\nBut, it's supported everywhere,\ncuz it's so easy.\n\n565\n00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:32.100\nNormally, we're gonna see VSANs,\nor zoning and\n\n566\n00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.210\nzoning is the most common,\nthat's what you'll see.\n\n567\n00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.050\nAnd it's normally one or\nthe other, either zoning or VSANS.\n\n568\n00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:40.110\nYou don't normally see both because\nthey kind of do the same thing, right?\n\n569\n00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.750\nIf you have VSANS that's\nthe one you want to use.\n\n570\n00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.230\nVSANS are more powerful.\n\n571\n00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:49.270\nBut if all you have is zoning, don't worry\nit's fine because the way zoning works\n\n572\n00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.690\nis it's not actually paying\nattention to who the host is.\n\n573\n00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:52.500\nIt doesn't care you're WEB01.\n\n574\n00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.130\nIt cares about the port\nyou're plugged into.\n\n575\n00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.590\nIt says,\nwhoever is plugged into this physical port\n\n576\n00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.900\ncan only see these LUNs, right?\n\n577\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.900\nCan only see these LUNs\nthat are in the same zone.\n\n578\n00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.890\nAnd that way,\nif a hacker were to break into WEB01,\n\n579\n00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.930\nit doesn't matter what they spoof.\n\n580\n00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:09.550\nThey would have to physically\nunplug this cable and\n\n581\n00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.150\nmove it to another port in\norder to see other drives.\n\n582\n00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.710\nThey'd have to have physical access.\n\n583\n00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.170\nAnd believe me if they\nhave physical access,\n\n584\n00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.570\nyou've got bigger problems\nthan LUN masking.\n\n585\n00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.920\nThey've got full access at that point.\n\n586\n00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.420\nSo when you VSANs or\nZoning it's tied to the physical port.\n\n587\n00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.300\nAnd there's an important concept you need\nto know here, what's called a world wide\n\n588\n00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.780\nname, because we don't care about the host\nthat's plugged in we need some way to\n\n589\n00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:36.700\nidentify the port the switch the node and\nthe lines, right?\n\n590\n00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.450\nAnd so the switch will assign what\nare called word wide names to these\n\n591\n00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:43.220\nidentifiers and the world wide part is\nthat they're supposed to be unique.\n\n592\n00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.400\nThey aren't necessarily but\nif you have more than one switch,\n\n593\n00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.010\nthere's supposed to be unique\nacross those switches and they are.\n\n594\n00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:53.112\nI've never seen a duplicate and that\nallows us to have more than one switch\n\n595\n00:27:53.112 --> 00:27:55.730\ndaisy chained and\nstill apply these names to it.\n\n596\n00:27:55.730 --> 00:28:00.850\nLet me show you an example, I've got\na fake fiber switch around here somewhere,\n\n597\n00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:06.600\nhere, all right so here's a san topology,\nthat I've got and it's a san switch\n\n598\n00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.100\nthat if I take a look at it, it's got\ntwo line cards in it with 24 ports each.\n\n599\n00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.010\nSo I've got two 24 port\nfiber channel cards in it.\n\n600\n00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.520\nAnd when I set this up,\nI kinda left it in the default.\n\n601\n00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:24.440\nSo all 24 ports on each line card, or all\n48 ports, are in the same logical network.\n\n602\n00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.550\nIf you plug into one you'll see\neverything that's on the others.\n\n603\n00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.550\nIf I plug in a san I'll see everything\nthat's on that san, all the lines.\n\n604\n00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.930\nBut we can go into,\nit's in here I'll show you my zoning.\n\n605\n00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:39.060\nSo in my zoning I've got just one default\nzone, everybody's in the default zone.\n\n606\n00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.100\nAnd over here you'll see\nhow it's tracking it.\n\n607\n00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.530\nSee how I've got host,\nadapter, port, right?\n\n608\n00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.350\nI've got a host machine and\nin the host, is an HPA, an adapter.\n\n609\n00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.770\nAnd in that adapter it's got a port.\n\n610\n00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.760\nAnd that's plugging in to my switch.\n\n611\n00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.329\nMy switch has a worldwide node name and\nthen in in the switch,\n\n612\n00:28:59.329 --> 00:29:04.356\nI've got ports, which are worldwide\nport names, wwnn and wwpn.\n\n613\n00:29:04.356 --> 00:29:11.050\nWwnn, that's the switch itself,\ncuz I might have more than one switch.\n\n614\n00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:16.480\nAnd WWPN, that's the port on that switch,\nand here's how we get our uniqueness.\n\n615\n00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.020\nAs long as I don't have two switches\nwith the same node name, I won't have\n\n616\n00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.380\nduplicates, cuz these two combine to\nform the identifier for that port, and\n\n617\n00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:29.480\nwe can create VSANs over here that\nindicate what is gonna be on that.\n\n618\n00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.350\nSo I can put one of my SANs on VSAN 1 and\na different SAN on VSAN 5.\n\n619\n00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.340\nAnd then, if you're not on VSAN5,\nyou don't see that other sand, or\n\n620\n00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.210\nyou can even divide the LUN level.\n\n621\n00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.110\nAnd really get granular on that stuff.\n\n622\n00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.370\n>> Seems like the same\nbasic concept of VLANs,\n\n623\n00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:47.970\nI'm segregating out the data\nusing ports or whatever.\n\n624\n00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.960\n>> It absolutely is,\nit really is the same.\n\n625\n00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.010\nAnd the configuration is pretty easy.\n\n626\n00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.870\nDifferent switches have different\nuser interfaces, right.\n\n627\n00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:58.790\nBut on this particular one you'll see\nwhere I've got a couple of VSANs to\n\n628\n00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.380\nfind here.\n\n629\n00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.640\nVSANs zero, one, two, three, and four.\n\n630\n00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.270\nAnd I can come over here and\nI can pick a VSAN.\n\n631\n00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.710\nLike if I take my default VSAN here,\nthis guy,\n\n632\n00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:08.750\nactually it's VSAN one,\nten, 20, 30, and 40.\n\n633\n00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.910\nIf I take VSAN 1 that's my default, right?\n\n634\n00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.360\nAnd if I look at my legend down here,\n\n635\n00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.900\nI'll see my ports aren't\nreally configured for this.\n\n636\n00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.480\nIf I jump into the switch, there we go,\n\n637\n00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.930\nnow I see it, all 24 ports\ncurrently belong to this VSAN.\n\n638\n00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:27.930\nSo all of my ports on both line cards,\nso all 48 ports are on VSAN 1.\n\n639\n00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:32.020\nBut I can start to take ports and redesign\nthem and move them to other ones, so\n\n640\n00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:36.390\nlet's say that VSAN 20 here,\nthis is gonna be my DMZ and\n\n641\n00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.850\nI wanna flag a couple of ports for it.\n\n642\n00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:43.080\nSo I can take some ports and\nstart to manipulate that configuration, so\n\n643\n00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.710\nwhat we do is we pick the port we\nwant to reassign, I'll take this one.\n\n644\n00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:50.100\nAnd then we can choose\nto add it to the VSAN.\n\n645\n00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.350\nAnd I'm gonna do that for\neach port that I want to add to VSAN 20,\n\n646\n00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:57.980\nand I'm moving them over to that VSAN.\n\n647\n00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.440\nAnd so then I can plug in one of\nmy physical SAN connectors, and\n\n648\n00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.270\nset some LUNs on it.\n\n649\n00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.670\nAnd then I can plug in my\nhosts into these ports.\n\n650\n00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:10.840\nAnd they will only see the LUNS that\nare attached to that set of links.\n\n651\n00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.490\nAnd so once I've got that in place,\nwhich come in those changes real quick.\n\n652\n00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:20.460\nThere we go, now notice when I look\nat VSAN 1, those four ports are gone.\n\n653\n00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.230\nAnd when I go up and\n\n654\n00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:25.260\nlook at VSAN 20 Those four ports\nare the only thing that's present.\n\n655\n00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:30.350\nI'm dividing up the ports on the switch,\nI don't care what you HBAI identifier is,\n\n656\n00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:33.620\nI care about the port,\nIt's a very physical thing.\n\n657\n00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.480\nWe take the security and\n\n658\n00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.120\nmove it to a physical area and\nthat's the best way to do it.\n\n659\n00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.705\nZoning and VSANs, they work the same way.\n\n660\n00:31:41.705 --> 00:31:45.590\nVSANS can just encompass more\nthan what a zone typically can.\n\n661\n00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:48.090\nAnd I just have that one zone\nbecause we're not using it.\n\n662\n00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.770\nI'm using the VSAN instead.\n\n663\n00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:50.930\nYou can jump in and configure that.\n\n664\n00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.640\nA great way to secure your systems and\nensure that it's very difficult for\n\n665\n00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.760\na hacker to spoof resources like that.\n\n666\n00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.790\n>> Yeah, this is definitely some of\nthe best information in this series yet\n\n667\n00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.800\nbecause this is the practical part, right?\n\n668\n00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.630\nThis is, I have to go in.\n\n669\n00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:03.640\nI have to work with a SAND.\n\n670\n00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.320\nI have to create a storage pool.\n\n671\n00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.407\nI have to create a LUN.\n\n672\n00:32:06.407 --> 00:32:07.760\nI have to secure those things so\n\n673\n00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:12.930\nthat only certain resources can access\ncertain ones for their purposes.\n\n674\n00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:16.450\nThis is the good stuff Don,\nyou're doing a great job of showing us.\n\n675\n00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:20.340\nI know that our viewers out\nthere are probably going, wow,\n\n676\n00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.860\nI can actually work with a SAN, I think.\n\n677\n00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.790\nIt's not that complicated.\n\n678\n00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.800\n>> It's not but, think about it,\n\n679\n00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.100\nif you make a mistake on the SAN,\nit's really hard to fix afterwards.\n\n680\n00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.990\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you got a bunch of virtual machines\n\n681\n00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:34.080\nrunning on there and a ton of data,\nyou gotta move that data off to fix it.\n\n682\n00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.830\nIf you decide, I'm gonna change\nmy RAID model, that's not fun.\n\n683\n00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.500\nThat's not something you wanna do, right.\n\n684\n00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.170\nSo you gotta make\nthe right decisions first.\n\n685\n00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.750\nAnd that's why it took me three\nepisodes before we even got to where we\n\n686\n00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:45.560\nconfigured something, right?\n\n687\n00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.880\nWe were covering all the concepts so\n\n688\n00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.640\nyou could make the right\ndecisions when the time came.\n\n689\n00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.650\nDifferent SANS support different features,\nso you might not see all the things that I\n\n690\n00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.950\nsee, and you might even have\nmore options than I see,\n\n691\n00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.690\nbecause you might have\na better SAN than I do.\n\n692\n00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:00.750\nProbably a given in most scenarios but\n\n693\n00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:03.730\njust be aware that it is a big\ndecision that you have to make.\n\n694\n00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:04.720\n>> What do they say?\n\n695\n00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.670\nProper preparation prevents\npoor performance right?\n\n696\n00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:08.360\nVery good stuff, Don.\n\n697\n00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.375\nIs there anything else that we\nneed to cover in this episode?\n\n698\n00:33:11.375 --> 00:33:12.715\nThese SAN devices.\n\n699\n00:33:12.715 --> 00:33:13.435\n>> That's about it.\n\n700\n00:33:13.435 --> 00:33:16.595\nI think we've covered storage in\npretty big depth at this point.\n\n701\n00:33:16.595 --> 00:33:17.995\nWe're gonna move to networking next.\n\n702\n00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:20.595\nSo we'll probably wrap this one up and\nthen head to the networking world.\n\n703\n00:33:20.595 --> 00:33:22.765\n>> All right, well thanks again for\njoining us and\n\n704\n00:33:22.765 --> 00:33:24.405\nexplaining these concepts to us.\n\n705\n00:33:24.405 --> 00:33:25.395\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n706\n00:33:25.395 --> 00:33:27.355\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n707\n00:33:27.355 --> 00:33:29.135\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n708\n00:33:29.135 --> 00:33:29.785\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n709\n00:33:29.785 --> 00:33:31.031\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n710\n00:33:31.031 --> 00:33:39.690\n[MUSIC].\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.230\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong,\n\n4\n00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.970\nand today we're gonna be taking\na look at the CompTIA Cloud Plus.\n\n5\n00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.510\nSpecifically we're gonna be\naddressing network concepts, and\n\n6\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.110\nwho better to help us than Mr.\nDon Pezet himself.\n\n7\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.740\nDon, what are we taking a look at today?\n\n8\n00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.390\n>> All right, well, we're gonna jump\ninto some general network concepts.\n\n9\n00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.340\nAnd like that name implies,\n\n10\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.330\nwe're not really focusing on\nthings that are only in the cloud.\n\n11\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.380\nThis is just standard networking\ntopics we need to be familiar with.\n\n12\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.547\nNow, some of you may have already\ndone the Network+ certification, and\n\n13\n00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:45.322\nif you have, then you probably\nalready know a lot of this stuff.\n\n14\n00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:48.630\nAnd you won't hurt my feelings if you\nskip the episode, that's just how it is.\n\n15\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.141\nBut, if you're just jumping\nstraight into Cloud Plus,\n\n16\n00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:54.488\nwe do need to have some basic fundamental\nexperience in just simple things,\n\n17\n00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:56.266\nlike IP addressing, and port numbers,\n\n18\n00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:59.809\nso that we know how to handle these\nprotocols in a virtual environment, right.\n\n19\n00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.350\nNow, if you're saying to yourself,\nDon, I don't need to know this stuff.\n\n20\n00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.920\nLet me just show you a quick example,\nright?\n\n21\n00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.365\nSo here on my desktop\nI've got VMware Fusion.\n\n22\n00:01:07.365 --> 00:01:10.288\nAnd so\nthis is my virtual machine library and\n\n23\n00:01:10.288 --> 00:01:13.372\neach virtual machine is\non a virtual network.\n\n24\n00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:15.610\nWe talked about virtual\nnetworks in another episode.\n\n25\n00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.100\nAnd if I go into my VMware Fusion\nsettings, when I jump into here and\n\n26\n00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.190\ninto the networking, here's where I\ncan start to set the configuration.\n\n27\n00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.750\nAnd you can see where I can\nshare system access with my MAC.\n\n28\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.504\nI can bridge a virtual machine to\nbe directly plugged into one of my\n\n29\n00:01:29.504 --> 00:01:33.020\nnetworks like Thunderbolt,\nor WiFi, or whatever.\n\n30\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.170\nBut then right down here, I can start\ncreating these virtual machine networks.\n\n31\n00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.840\nAnd when you do that, you have to\nspecify Subnet IPs and Subnet Masks.\n\n32\n00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.580\nAnd If you don't know\nwhat a subnet mask does,\n\n33\n00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.370\nthere's a lot of mistakes that can be\nmade here that can cause some problems.\n\n34\n00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.390\nAnd some of the new shorthand notation or\n\n35\n00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.450\nside or subnet notation for\nwriting subnets is important to know, too.\n\n36\n00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.675\nAnd this is VMware Fusion, but\n\n37\n00:01:55.675 --> 00:01:58.200\nall the various virtualization\nproducts are this way.\n\n38\n00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.350\nThey have different ways of setting it,\nbut the concept underneath is the same.\n\n39\n00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.076\nSo in this episode, we're gonna talk about\nthose subnet masks, and what they mean,\n\n40\n00:02:06.076 --> 00:02:09.490\nhow they work, how we can use them to\ncreate the virtual networks that we need,\n\n41\n00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.596\nso we make sure that's\nimplemented properly.\n\n42\n00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:13.753\nAnd then we put our virtual\nmachines on top of them.\n\n43\n00:02:13.753 --> 00:02:17.567\n>> All right, so Don, when we start taking\na look at this concept and this idea,\n\n44\n00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:21.032\nwe generally talk about the two\nconcepts of what we call subnetting and\n\n45\n00:02:21.032 --> 00:02:23.600\nmaybe even possibly supernetting as well.\n\n46\n00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.580\nSo that's what we're really gonna try and\naddress, right?\n\n47\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.610\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n48\n00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.400\nAnd let's just start with\nthat concept of subnetting.\n\n49\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.440\nWe'll worry about supernetting\ntowards the end of the episode.\n\n50\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.680\nIt's far less common.\n\n51\n00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.820\nBut with subnetting, basically it's where\nyou take a network and you divide it up.\n\n52\n00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.130\nWhen you bring up your virtual\nmachines and your private cloud,\n\n53\n00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.560\nor even in the public cloud, you've\ngot to set IP address ranges for them.\n\n54\n00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.750\nAnd sometimes that's done for you,\nsometimes you've got to do it yourself.\n\n55\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.100\nIt just kinda depends on what\nyou're planning on doing and\n\n56\n00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.030\nwhat you wanna get set up.\n\n57\n00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.430\nSo let's just start really simple.\n\n58\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.860\nLet's take a look at that network\nthat we just saw a moment ago.\n\n59\n00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.490\nSo if I have a network like 192.168.0.0,\nand\n\n60\n00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.475\nthat's combined with a subnet\nmask like 255.255.255.0.\n\n61\n00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:10.665\nWhen I have something like that,\nright, what does that tell me?\n\n62\n00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:14.616\nAnd it what it's telling me is\nthat these parts right here,\n\n63\n00:03:14.616 --> 00:03:18.019\nthe subnet mask, 255.255.255.0,\n\n64\n00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.685\nthey're telling me where the network\naddress ends and the host address begins.\n\n65\n00:03:23.685 --> 00:03:26.350\nWhen you look at an IP address\nthere's actually two parts of it.\n\n66\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.680\nYou don't see it by itself.\n\n67\n00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.991\nIf I just give you an IP address,\nlike if I give you, I don't know, 109.251.\n\n68\n00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:38.595\nHere, I want to use one of ours,\n209.251.159.179.\n\n69\n00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:40.351\nThere we go,\nthat's the IP address of the studio here.\n\n70\n00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:44.550\nSo if I give you this address,\nit just looks like a single address.\n\n71\n00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.160\nYou see an IP address, and that's it.\n\n72\n00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.250\nBut part of this is my network and\npart of this is my host.\n\n73\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.730\nAnd when you get a subnet mask like\nthis one it's telling you which part.\n\n74\n00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.229\nSo what this subnet mask tells me\nis wherever there's a 255, right,\n\n75\n00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:05.079\n255.255.255, those three, what are called\noctets, those are the network ID.\n\n76\n00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:11.110\nSo in this case, 209.251.159,\nthat would be part of my network ID.\n\n77\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.003\nAnd then where I've got a 0 in that subnet\nmask, that's this last part, that's a 179,\n\n78\n00:04:16.003 --> 00:04:17.337\nthat would be my host ID.\n\n79\n00:04:17.337 --> 00:04:21.450\nAnd if I have two hosts on the same\nnetwork, then they can talk to each other,\n\n80\n00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.622\nno problem, right.\n\n81\n00:04:22.622 --> 00:04:27.509\nSo if I have another host\nthat is 209.251.159.15,\n\n82\n00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.940\nright, these two guys can\ntalk to each other just fine.\n\n83\n00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.460\nBecause the first three octets,\n\n84\n00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.000\nthese guys right here,\nare all the same across the board, right?\n\n85\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.910\nThey both start with 209.251.159.\n\n86\n00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.720\nThat's the network ID, they're on the same\nnetwork they can talk to each other.\n\n87\n00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.310\nEverything that's after that,\nI don't really care about, right?\n\n88\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.821\nAll these guys here, 179 and 15,\nas long as they're just not the same.\n\n89\n00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:56.000\nYou can't have two people\nwith the same address.\n\n90\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.720\nAnd what I equate this to is like\na street address for a home, right?\n\n91\n00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.620\nOur office, our office building here\nis 6933 Northwest 4th Boulevard.\n\n92\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.261\nWell, Northwest 4th Boulevard,\nthat's the street, and\n\n93\n00:05:09.261 --> 00:05:11.550\nthere's many other buildings\nhere on this street.\n\n94\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.570\nAnd their addresses all end\nin Northwest 4th Boulevard.\n\n95\n00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.134\nI can, I don't even have to get in a car,\nbut I can hop in a car and\n\n96\n00:05:17.134 --> 00:05:20.250\ndrive down the same road and\nget to any of those other buildings.\n\n97\n00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.835\nBut I can tell the buildings apart because\nof that first part of their address.\n\n98\n00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:28.480\nSo ours is 6933 NW 4th Blvd.\n\n99\n00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.330\nThis is my street, right?\n\n100\n00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.630\nMany people have that same street name,\nbut we're the only ones that are 6933,\n\n101\n00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.150\nthat's us.\n\n102\n00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.173\nWell, that's how this address works.\n\n103\n00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:42.502\n179, that would be like\nthe building number 6933.\n\n104\n00:05:42.502 --> 00:05:47.000\nAnd then 209.251.159 that's\nthe street name, right?\n\n105\n00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.229\nNW 4th Blvd.\n\n106\n00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.980\nAnd there might be other\npeople here on the street.\n\n107\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.868\nI'm sure there's a 6935.\n\n108\n00:05:53.868 --> 00:05:55.350\nI don't know who it is but\nI'm sure there is one.\n\n109\n00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.150\nThey would be like that, right?\n\n110\n00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.060\nSame street name but\na different building number.\n\n111\n00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.530\nAnd likewise, again I don't know for\ncertain, but there is probably a 6933\n\n112\n00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.806\nNW 5th Blvd, all right?\n\n113\n00:06:10.806 --> 00:06:14.590\nNow, I make the same typo over and\nover again.\n\n114\n00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.900\nNow, notice how they're 6933,\nand I'm 6933.\n\n115\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.990\nWe've got two people that are 6933.\n\n116\n00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.670\nIs that a problem?\n\n117\n00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:22.240\nWell, it can be.\n\n118\n00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.280\nIt certainly can be a problem\nif they're on the same street.\n\n119\n00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.020\nBut these aren't, they're on two different\nstreets and it's okay, all right.\n\n120\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.930\nIt's okay cuz they're on two different\nstreets and that's how IP addresses work.\n\n121\n00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.000\nIt's okay to have two people with the same\nhost ID as long as their network ID\n\n122\n00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.200\nis different.\n\n123\n00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.600\nBut the key thing to remember\nhere is I can't get from NW 4th\n\n124\n00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.990\nBlvd to somewhere on NW 5th Blvd,\nwithout taking two streets, right?\n\n125\n00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.570\nI've gotta go to those two streets\nto get there, maybe even more.\n\n126\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.940\nI've gotta find a route to get there,\nversus if they're on the same street,\n\n127\n00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.870\nI don't need a route.\n\n128\n00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.120\nIt's the same street.\n\n129\n00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.110\nI just turn left or right and\nI'm gonna find that place, right?\n\n130\n00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.680\nWell, that's how networks are.\n\n131\n00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.758\nThat when you've got two\npeople communicating and\n\n132\n00:07:02.758 --> 00:07:04.787\nthey're right next to each\nother like these two,\n\n133\n00:07:04.787 --> 00:07:07.457\nthey can get between each other\njust by passing through a switch.\n\n134\n00:07:07.457 --> 00:07:09.813\nWe don't need a router involved at all.\n\n135\n00:07:09.813 --> 00:07:18.412\nBut if it's 115.71.200.93, right?\n\n136\n00:07:18.412 --> 00:07:20.420\nI'm just making up an address here.\n\n137\n00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.750\nThis one is on a different network.\n\n138\n00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.589\nAnd in order to get to that other network,\nmy first two hosts,\n\n139\n00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:28.150\nthey're gonna have to\npass through a router.\n\n140\n00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.270\nThey're going to have to get\nrouted to get to that destination.\n\n141\n00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.784\nNow I know what you're thinking, well,\n\n142\n00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:33.874\nhow does all this matter in\nthe world of virtualization?\n\n143\n00:07:33.874 --> 00:07:35.543\nWhat do I care about this stuff at all?\n\n144\n00:07:35.543 --> 00:07:40.512\nWell, the reason you care about it is\nbecause in software like VMware and\n\n145\n00:07:40.512 --> 00:07:44.420\nESX where you create virtual switches and\nvirtual box and\n\n146\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.634\nMicrosoft's Hyper-V, when you start\ncreating these virtual networks,\n\n147\n00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:54.700\neach virtual network has to get assigned\nan IP address like this, right.\n\n148\n00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.476\nAnd let me just unlock this real quick so\nI can make changes.\n\n149\n00:07:58.476 --> 00:07:59.358\nThere we go.\n\n150\n00:07:59.358 --> 00:08:03.334\nAnd you can pick what you want that subnet\nmass to be, and what you want those IP's\n\n151\n00:08:03.334 --> 00:08:06.570\nto be and whether you want to issue\nDHCP addresses on the network.\n\n152\n00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.230\nYou can pick that stuff.\n\n153\n00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.950\nAnd the network that you pick\nis going to limit the amount\n\n154\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.130\nof virtual machines you\ncan have on that network,\n\n155\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.070\ncause if you make a network too small you\nmight not have enough IP's available.\n\n156\n00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.370\nIf you make it too big\nyou're just being wasteful.\n\n157\n00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.540\nAnd potentially you could be\noverlapping with networks that exist in\n\n158\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.670\nyour environment.\n\n159\n00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.170\nAnd if that happens, now its like\nhaving two streets with the same name.\n\n160\n00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.780\nHow do you route between that?\n\n161\n00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.630\nIf there's two\nNorthwest Fourth Boulevards,\n\n162\n00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.550\nhow do I know which one an address is on?\n\n163\n00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.070\nYou don't.\nYou start getting this overlap,\n\n164\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.900\nconfusion, really creates some problems.\n\n165\n00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.300\nSo you gotta be able\nto keep this separate.\n\n166\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.110\nAnd that's why its important that we\nunderstand how these addresses work.\n\n167\n00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.110\nAnd the other thing is that when\nyou create one of these networks,\n\n168\n00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:50.230\nyour virtualization platform\nacts like a router.\n\n169\n00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.810\nRight?\n\n170\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.620\nSo, for example, if I take my, let me see\nif I have a client sitting around here\n\n171\n00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.800\nsomewhere, this guy, Win-CLIENT01,\nthis client right here.\n\n172\n00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.050\nIf I take a look at its settings, and I'll\njust drive into it's network card here.\n\n173\n00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.188\nI can see now that it's set\nto bridge networking, but\n\n174\n00:09:07.188 --> 00:09:11.748\nI'm going to move it over to VM network,\nwe'll do VM network three, right?\n\n175\n00:09:11.748 --> 00:09:14.672\nThis network right here, so\nif I look at this network,\n\n176\n00:09:14.672 --> 00:09:19.589\nit's 192.168.0.0 with a subnet\nmask of 255.255.255.0 right?\n\n177\n00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:24.530\nSo it's VM net three and there's what I\ngoing to put that network machine on okay.\n\n178\n00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.750\nAnd then I'm going to boot\nthat machine up, there we go.\n\n179\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.904\nAnd so, this machine's gonna fire up,\nit's just Windows 7, Windows 10,\n\n180\n00:09:32.904 --> 00:09:34.027\nWindows something.\n\n181\n00:09:34.027 --> 00:09:35.088\nWindows 2.1?\n\n182\n00:09:35.088 --> 00:09:37.040\n[LAUGH] And so,\nI'm pretty sure it's Windows 7.\n\n183\n00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.960\nSo while it's booting,\nI just put that on VMnet3, so\n\n184\n00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.570\nlet's take a look at\nthe settings on VMnet3.\n\n185\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.426\nSo I'm gonna jump back here into\nnetworking, and go into VM Network 3.\n\n186\n00:09:45.426 --> 00:09:50.520\nAnd that's 192.168.0.0, 255.255.255.0, so\nthe first three octets 192.168.0 that's\n\n187\n00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.940\nmy network ID and the last octet\nthat's going to be the host ID,\n\n188\n00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:01.720\nright, that's going to be\nthe host that's booting up and\n\n189\n00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.830\nI'm providing addresses\nvia DHCP which means I'll\n\n190\n00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.050\ngive an address to that work station\nwhen it comes up, it will get one.\n\n191\n00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.870\nAnd it will be on this network.\n\n192\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.530\nAll right.\n\n193\n00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.440\nIt's actually going to do a lot more.\n\n194\n00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.890\nThe software here isn't showing.\n\n195\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.350\nWell, I guess you kind of see\nit here with this little note.\n\n196\n00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:22.080\nAllow virtual machine on this network to\nconnect to external networks using NAT.\n\n197\n00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.050\nNow we're going to talk more about network\nadded translation in the next episode.\n\n198\n00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:29.750\nBut what that's doing is basically saying\nI want these clients to be on a network,\n\n199\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.920\non a subnet, but\nI also want them to have internet access.\n\n200\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.270\nI want them to be able to get out to\nother networks that are out there.\n\n201\n00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.760\nWell remember what I said back here.\n\n202\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.570\nIf I want to communicate,\nthat's a pretty zoom isn't it.\n\n203\n00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.310\nIf I want to communicate\nbetween two different networks.\n\n204\n00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.180\nWhat do I need.\n\n205\n00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.090\nWhat's the device that I need?\n\n206\n00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:48.880\n>> A router.\n\n207\n00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.470\n>> I need a router, and so\nin this case VMware fusion or\n\n208\n00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.740\nVM ESX or hyper V or virtual box, KVM,\n\n209\n00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.320\nwhatever virtualization platform you're\nusing it creates a virtual router.\n\n210\n00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.530\nSo there is actually a virtual router\nrunning in your software in the background\n\n211\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.450\nthat's allowing these\nnetworks to be routed and\n\n212\n00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.780\nsometimes performing things\nlike network ad translation,\n\n213\n00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.450\nreally advanced stuff,\nwhich we'll see again later.\n\n214\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.290\nBut basically now my virtualization\nplatform is not only creating hardware for\n\n215\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:22.610\nthese programs to run on but\ncreating virtual network infrastructure.\n\n216\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.440\nWe talked about virtual switches earlier,\nthose are pretty important.\n\n217\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.440\nBut your virtual routers are just as\nimportant if you want to communicate\n\n218\n00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.420\nbetween these subnets, all right.\n\n219\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.190\nLet's go take a look at that\nmachine that's booted up.\n\n220\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.990\nNow the hardest part I\ngotta remember my password.\n\n221\n00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.635\nA smarter me would start\nwriting these things down.\n\n222\n00:11:37.635 --> 00:11:39.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But there we go.\n\n223\n00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.500\nAll right so here's my Windows 7 machine,\nit's booted up and,\n\n224\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.960\nI'm just going to jump into\na command prompt real quick.\n\n225\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.330\nAnd let's take a look at what we've got.\n\n226\n00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:55.390\nIf I do an ipconfig and\nlook at my address.\n\n227\n00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.933\nSure enough, I've got 192.168.0.146,\n\n228\n00:11:58.933 --> 00:12:03.009\nand 255.255.255.0, so\nI'm on that 192.168.0 network.\n\n229\n00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.670\nNotice my default gateway, though.\n\n230\n00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.890\nRight?\nYour default gateway.\n\n231\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.510\nThat's the router you're going to use when\nyou try and get out to the internet or\n\n232\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.490\nreally just any network you're\nnot directly plugged into.\n\n233\n00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.234\nSo mine is 192.168.0.2.\n\n234\n00:12:16.234 --> 00:12:17.600\nWell, who is 192.168.0.2?\n\n235\n00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.620\nI don't know.\n\n236\n00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.570\nRight?\nI don't know who that is.\n\n237\n00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:23.520\nIf I try and ping it.\n\n238\n00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.310\nI'm gonna ping out to it and\nI get some pings back, so\n\n239\n00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.570\nwhoever it is is up and online.\n\n240\n00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.820\nAnd if I do an arp -a, here's 192.168.0.2,\nhere's a MAC address, right.\n\n241\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:40.100\nSo here's a MAC address for\nthat system that I'm getting back.\n\n242\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.529\nWell, let's do a quick\nlookup on that MAC address.\n\n243\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.950\nAnd we'll see.\n\n244\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.350\nWell, actually, I should test to see\ncan I even get out to the internet?\n\n245\n00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:51.080\nAm I able to get out to the internet\ngoing through that host?\n\n246\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.290\nAnd we'll see if we can get to Google or\nsomewhere.\n\n247\n00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.380\nI haven't even tried pinging.\n\n248\n00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.360\nI was able to ping the gateway,\nbut can I ping beyond that?\n\n249\n00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.340\nAnd I can.\n\n250\n00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.330\nYep, I'm pinging out, although it looks\nlike I might not have DNS servers set.\n\n251\n00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.840\nCuz I'm waiting for Google.\n\n252\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.330\nDid my DNS settings occur?\n\n253\n00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.730\nWell, I can always check my ipconfig and\n\n254\n00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.690\nverify that I've got DNS servers,\nand I do.\n\n255\n00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.960\nActually look at my DNS servers.\n\n256\n00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.870\nNotice how I had that\ngateway of 192.168.0.2 But\n\n257\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.070\nnow I've got a DNS server 192.\n\n258\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.190\nThis is that 192.168.0.2.\n\n259\n00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.350\nIt's a router and a DNS server?\n\n260\n00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.270\nWhat the heck's that all about?\n\n261\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.980\nAll right, well, it's certainly possible.\n\n262\n00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.160\nNow if I, there we go, all right.\n\n263\n00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.580\nSo I wanna do a mac oui lookup.\n\n264\n00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.150\nThat's what I wanna do.\n\n265\n00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.190\nAnd it looks like wire\nsearch got a tool for us.\n\n266\n00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.320\nWe'll use theirs.\n\n267\n00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.120\nAnd what I want to do is I want to look up\nthat Mac address to kind of get an idea of\n\n268\n00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.130\nwho that is, right?\n\n269\n00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.240\nWho is that system that I\ndon't know about, 19816802.\n\n270\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:58.490\nI guess I can kind of save us a little\nbit of time in that, its vmr fusion.\n\n271\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:02.910\nIts the virtual router that its\ncreated to service this machine, and\n\n272\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:07.550\nit's going to sit there and do those look\nups for me, apparently very, very slowly.\n\n273\n00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.470\nPlease let me do a look up.\n\n274\n00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.100\nThere we go, we'll use these guys.\n\n275\n00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.050\nSo, I'm gonna do a mac address and\nvendor search and\n\n276\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.850\nI'm just gonna paste in the first part and\n\n277\n00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.860\nsure enough address prefix 00:50:56\nis VM Ware Incorporated, right?\n\n278\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:25.170\nSo, that's VM fusion\ncreating a virtual router.\n\n279\n00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.840\nI can't I can't SSH into it and manage it.\n\n280\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.780\nI can't create access control lists on it.\n\n281\n00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.780\nI can't do any of that crazy stuff\nlike you would on a Cisco router,\n\n282\n00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.980\nbut apparently a certificate.\n\n283\n00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.580\nYou know what, we'll just cancel that.\n\n284\n00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.400\nAll right, so we're not going to\nload cancel certificates today.\n\n285\n00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.030\nSo either way though there's\nthis virtual router and\n\n286\n00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.270\nthat's a part of our virtualization\nplatform that's doing it.\n\n287\n00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.730\nSo that's really important to remember\nthat not only do you have virtual switches\n\n288\n00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.710\nbut you have virtual routers also.\n\n289\n00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.620\nAnd it's all there to provide that\nconnectivity and so if I do something like\n\n290\n00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:02.520\na trace route to see how I can get\nto an external network, right.\n\n291\n00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:08.230\nWhen I do trace route my first hop\nis going to be VMware fusion, right?\n\n292\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.210\nI passing through from\n192 through 168 to 0 2.\n\n293\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.370\nAnd then I'm going over to my laptop and\ngoing where ever from there.\n\n294\n00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.170\nI'll just cancel that.\n\n295\n00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.470\nSo that's kind of the steps\nthat are occurring there,\n\n296\n00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.460\nthat VM pull routers is very key.\n\n297\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.400\nAnd, if we have that mis-configured then\nit doesn't work, then we don't get out.\n\n298\n00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.250\nLike, if we turn off the nat functionality\nthen it's not gonna let us get out and,\n\n299\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.930\nthat router might even disappear,\nthe IP might not even be present,\n\n300\n00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:34.590\nif I'm not serving up DHCP and\na route and all that other stuff, then,\n\n301\n00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.110\nit may just be removed, and now I\ndon't even have a gateway to get out.\n\n302\n00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.540\nSo, all part of the configuration of\nadding, virtual machines to a network.\n\n303\n00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.985\nAll right, now if you are setting\nthis up from scratch,\n\n304\n00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:48.736\none of the first things you need to think\nabout is how do you pick a network number?\n\n305\n00:15:48.736 --> 00:15:51.998\nYou guys have probably\nall seen 192.168.0.0.\n\n306\n00:15:51.998 --> 00:15:53.031\nThat is a pretty common one, right?\n\n307\n00:15:53.031 --> 00:15:54.064\nA lot of people use that.\n\n308\n00:15:54.064 --> 00:15:57.390\nBut there's a few other ranges\nthat you'll see out there, and\n\n309\n00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.850\nlet's just highlight a few of those,\nright?\n\n310\n00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.949\nSo, 192.168.0.0,\nthat's a pretty common one.\n\n311\n00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:07.868\nThere's 172.16.0.0,\n\n312\n00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:14.435\nwhich actually goes all\nthe way to 172.31.0.0.\n\n313\n00:16:14.435 --> 00:16:18.930\nAnd then there's the 10.0.0.0.\n\n314\n00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:22.760\nThose three ranges right there are really,\nreally pretty common.\n\n315\n00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.750\nI'm gonna write this a bit different here,\ntry to make it.\n\n316\n00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.020\nThere we go, basically that whole range.\n\n317\n00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.670\nSo, what are these networks?\n\n318\n00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.070\nWhat is it that's being created here?\n\n319\n00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.990\nWell, the subnet masks are really\nimportant to understand\n\n320\n00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.030\nhow big these networks are, right?\n\n321\n00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.330\nThis first one is what used\nto be called the class C.\n\n322\n00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.820\nIn networks we use to have\nwhat were called classes, and\n\n323\n00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.830\nthere were three classes called,\nClass A, Class B and Class C.\n\n324\n00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.410\nThere are actually a few others but\n\n325\n00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.670\nas far as we're concerned\nthere's only three today.\n\n326\n00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.920\nSo Class A, Class B, and Class C.\n\n327\n00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.576\nAll right, a Class A network,\nI might need your help on this, Ronnie.\n\n328\n00:16:58.576 --> 00:17:01.373\nIt would give us, what was it,\n16.7 million IPs?\n\n329\n00:17:01.373 --> 00:17:03.057\n>> Pretty much.\n\n330\n00:17:03.057 --> 00:17:07.320\n>> So it was around 16.7 million IPs.\n\n331\n00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.691\nI don't wanna figure out\nthe precise number on this one, but\n\n332\n00:17:10.691 --> 00:17:12.670\naround 16.7 million IPs.\n\n333\n00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.060\nThat's a huge network.\n\n334\n00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.800\nClass A network's are really, really big.\n\n335\n00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.510\nClass B networks are a bit smaller.\n\n336\n00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.586\nA Class B network would give\nyou around 65,000 IP's.\n\n337\n00:17:22.586 --> 00:17:26.788\nI think it's actually 65,534.\n\n338\n00:17:26.788 --> 00:17:27.346\nDoes that sound right?\n\n339\n00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:27.892\n>> That is correct.\n\n340\n00:17:27.892 --> 00:17:28.551\n>> Perfect.\n\n341\n00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:30.270\nSo there we go.\n\n342\n00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.280\nAnd then a Class C,\nwell it was the smallest.\n\n343\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.884\nIt will give you 254 IPs.\n\n344\n00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.860\nDepending on how many hosts you needed on\nyour network, you would get a Class A,\n\n345\n00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.000\nClass B, or Class C to meet your needs.\n\n346\n00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.590\nIf you're creating virtual machines,\nodds are Class C's can be big enough.\n\n347\n00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.360\nBut, if you have enough virtual machines,\nmaybe you need to go to Class B.\n\n348\n00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.540\nIt's rare that you need\nto go to a Class A.\n\n349\n00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:56.918\nWell, these classes actually determined\nthe IP address that you're going to use.\n\n350\n00:17:56.918 --> 00:18:03.616\nSo Class As, for example,\nall started with 1 through 126.\n\n351\n00:18:03.616 --> 00:18:08.069\nClass Bs all started with 128 through,\nis it 191?\n\n352\n00:18:08.069 --> 00:18:09.068\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n353\n00:18:09.068 --> 00:18:09.590\n>> 191.\n\n354\n00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.250\nRon has got my back today.\n\n355\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.167\nIt's important.\n\n356\n00:18:13.167 --> 00:18:15.768\nSo 128 through 191.\n\n357\n00:18:15.768 --> 00:18:21.840\nAnd then class Cs all\nstarted with 192 through 223.\n\n358\n00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.647\nSo if I have you an IP address\nlike 209.251.159.179 right?\n\n359\n00:18:28.647 --> 00:18:29.720\nThat's our IP address here in the studio.\n\n360\n00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.880\nIf I gave you that IP,\nyou could figure what it was.\n\n361\n00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.640\nYou could look up here and say, well it's\nstarts with 209 and that's in this range.\n\n362\n00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.915\nIt's a Class C.\n\n363\n00:18:38.915 --> 00:18:40.480\nITProTV must have 254 IPs.\n\n364\n00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:50.430\nOr if I gave you an address of\n17.41.112.98 you could say well,\n\n365\n00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:54.810\n17, that falls in the Class A range,\nit's got 16.7 million IPs.\n\n366\n00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.990\nThat's how it worked in the olden days.\n\n367\n00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.200\nBut the problem here is that there really\njust weren't that many networks if you\n\n368\n00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.300\nthink about it, right?\n\n369\n00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.160\nThere were only 126 Class As.\n\n370\n00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.520\nAnd when they started\nrunning out of those,\n\n371\n00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.790\nwell you kind of end up\nin some problems there.\n\n372\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.030\nThere's also big gaps in-between.\n\n373\n00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:15.175\nLet's say that I had 65,536 computers.\n\n374\n00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:18.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, I'm just a little too big for\n\n375\n00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.410\na Class B so I've gotta step up to\na Class A, and now I've got 16.7 million.\n\n376\n00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:27.200\nI'm wasting 16 million\naddresses because the 700,000\n\n377\n00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.670\nextra right here was more than enough to\ncover what I needed, but is very wasteful.\n\n378\n00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.940\nSo the old class model was very wasteful.\n\n379\n00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.610\nAnd that's where subnet masks came in.\n\n380\n00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:41.660\nSubnet masks eliminated these classes and\nlet us bring in variations.\n\n381\n00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.980\nAnd this is the key concept you\nneed to be aware of for the exam.\n\n382\n00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.510\nA Class A was technically 255.0.0.0.\n\n383\n00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.540\nA Class B was 255.255.0.0.\n\n384\n00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.040\nAnd a Class C, 255.255.255.0.\n\n385\n00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.430\nSo in a Class A, the first octet,\n\n386\n00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:03.460\nthe first number,\nthat was part of your network ID.\n\n387\n00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.620\nEverything else was a host ID.\n\n388\n00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.130\nIn a B it was it was the first two octets.\n\n389\n00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.960\nIn a class C it was\nthe first three octets.\n\n390\n00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:15.050\nSo each one had a slightly different\nlevel of network ID versus host ID.\n\n391\n00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.500\nBut you can do what's called classless.\n\n392\n00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.380\nEnter domain routing or sider.\n\n393\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.416\nRight?\nThere's two kinda key concepts here.\n\n394\n00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:33.280\nThere's classless inter-domain routing,\nwhich is CIDR.\n\n395\n00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:42.360\nAnd there is variable length subnet masks,\nwhich are VLSM.\n\n396\n00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.100\nAnd these two technologies\ncombined allow you to create very,\n\n397\n00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.930\nvery specialized networks.\n\n398\n00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.130\nSo for example, this 209.251.159.179.\n\n399\n00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:56.670\nOn the old classfull model,\nthat would mean that ITProTV has 254 IPs.\n\n400\n00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:01.854\nBasically 209.251.159.1 all\nthe way through 254, right?\n\n401\n00:21:01.854 --> 00:21:02.933\nBut we don't.\n\n402\n00:21:02.933 --> 00:21:04.130\nWe don't have that many IPs.\n\n403\n00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.530\nWe actually only have 16.\n\n404\n00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.160\nWe have 16 IPs, this is just one of them.\n\n405\n00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.990\nWell, which of these\nclasses gives you 16 IPs?\n\n406\n00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.860\n>> None of them.\n\n407\n00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.930\n>> None of them, right?\n\n408\n00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.360\nSo we would have to get 254\nIPs if that's our only option.\n\n409\n00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.780\nNot if we go classless.\n\n410\n00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.780\nAnd with classless,\nyou really break things down,\n\n411\n00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.450\nand you can start to get mixtures,\nmixtures of what's available.\n\n412\n00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.250\nAnd so our network, for example,\nwhat do we have here, Ronnie?\n\n413\n00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.410\nIs it a slash 28?\n\n414\n00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.220\n>> It is a slash 28.\n\n415\n00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.160\n>> We have a slash 28, okay.\n\n416\n00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.470\nSo this is our actual network right here,\n209.252.159.179/28, all right?\n\n417\n00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:42.765\nWhat the heck is that /28 all about.\n\n418\n00:21:42.765 --> 00:21:45.745\nWell, a slash 28 is a subnet mask.\n\n419\n00:21:45.745 --> 00:21:48.525\nIt's the equivalent of one of these.\n\n420\n00:21:48.525 --> 00:21:51.425\nBut instead of identifying something\nthat's human readable like\n\n421\n00:21:51.425 --> 00:21:52.095\nthese guys up here.\n\n422\n00:21:52.095 --> 00:21:52.805\nThat's human readable.\n\n423\n00:21:52.805 --> 00:21:56.025\nIt's really easy to spot what octets\nare part of the network ID and\n\n424\n00:21:56.025 --> 00:21:57.765\nwhat are part of the host ID.\n\n425\n00:21:57.765 --> 00:21:58.345\nRight?\n\n426\n00:21:58.345 --> 00:21:59.845\nBut the slash 28, it isn't.\n\n427\n00:21:59.845 --> 00:22:01.942\nAnd really there's no way around that.\n\n428\n00:22:01.942 --> 00:22:07.420\nYou've gotta convert to binary to be able\nto figure out what that means to us.\n\n429\n00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.570\nAnd what a 28 means in\nbinary is just 28 ones.\n\n430\n00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:16.679\nSo the first 28 bits, and\nI IP address are 32-bit number.\n\n431\n00:22:16.679 --> 00:22:20.920\nAll right, it's 32-bits,\n32 ones and zeroes long.\n\n432\n00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.950\nAnd so if we were to take a number\nlike this and convert it, right?\n\n433\n00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.680\nWhich, let's see, Ronnie,\ndo you have a calculator handy?\n\n434\n00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.250\nLet me see if I can, I don't know if\nthe Mac calculator will actually convert\n\n435\n00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:35.020\nthese, I might just have to pick an easier\none that I can do in my head here, but\n\n436\n00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.910\nif I go programmer style,\nit might convert for me.\n\n437\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:37.580\nIt will, perfect.\n\n438\n00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:42.400\nI'm gonna take this Mac calculator\nhere and just kind of convert these.\n\n439\n00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.230\nSo if I take 209 and write it in binary.\n\n440\n00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:48.170\nIt's kinda showing me down here\nwhat that would look like.\n\n441\n00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:52.220\nAnd an octet, we talk about an octet,\nis eight bits.\n\n442\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.670\nAnd so when I take a number like 209,\noops I'm writing that in hex,\n\n443\n00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.650\nlet me get back to decimal,\nthere we go, 209.\n\n444\n00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.993\nWhen I write 209 in decimal\nwhat we normally write at,\n\n445\n00:23:01.993 --> 00:23:04.093\nin binary it looks very different.\n\n446\n00:23:04.093 --> 00:23:08.109\n209 becomes 11 0 1 0 0 0 1, right?\n\n447\n00:23:08.109 --> 00:23:14.020\nSo I'm gonna rewrite\nthat in binary like that.\n\n448\n00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.710\nSo that's 209.\n\n449\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.980\nAnd then I've got 251.\n\n450\n00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.670\nAnd then I'll have 159 and 179, right?\n\n451\n00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:27.130\nEach one of these is kind\nof part of that address.\n\n452\n00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.980\nAnd we'll have to write\nthat out in binary.\n\n453\n00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:38.917\nSo if I take 251 is 1111011.\n\n454\n00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:42.632\nLittle off on my alignment there.\n\n455\n00:23:42.632 --> 00:23:46.428\nAll right, and then we'll take 159 and\ndo the same thing.\n\n456\n00:23:46.428 --> 00:23:52.463\n1001 And the last one is 179.\n\n457\n00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.886\nWhich is 10110011.\n\n458\n00:23:57.886 --> 00:24:00.920\nThere we go.\nAll right, so that right there is 209.\n\n459\n00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.260\n251.\n179 written in binary.\n\n460\n00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:09.410\nOkay now I got that /28 and\nI need to go back to that.\n\n461\n00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.880\nWell what is the /28?\n\n462\n00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.450\nWell that means I need to write 28 ones,\nso if I come through here and\n\n463\n00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:20.820\nI write these 28 ones and then zeros.\n\n464\n00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:24.690\nInstead of having my subnet mask\nend right at one of the periods,\n\n465\n00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.140\nwhich is how we did it in the class right.\n\n466\n00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:30.430\nClass A, B, and C, the subnet mask always\nended on one of these periods, right.\n\n467\n00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.360\nWhen you do variable length subnet masks,\nyou can end it wherever you want.\n\n468\n00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.250\nAnd so\nmy subnet mask is ending right here.\n\n469\n00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.520\nOkay right here after that\nfourth one in the middle,\n\n470\n00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.580\nsmack in the middle of that octet.\n\n471\n00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:50.067\nAnd if we were to write that in decimal,\nit would look something like this,\n\n472\n00:24:50.067 --> 00:24:55.522\n255.255.255 dot,\n\n473\n00:24:55.522 --> 00:24:58.280\nwhat is that, 240?\n\n474\n00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.170\n>> 240.\n>> I did that one in my head.\n\n475\n00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.290\nSo it would look like 255 dot 255 dot 255\ndot 240 which is not terribly meaningful\n\n476\n00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:05.680\nto us.\n\n477\n00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.440\nWhen you see 240,\nwhere in 179 does that break up?\n\n478\n00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:15.390\nBut when I look at it in binary I\ncan see that division happening\n\n479\n00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:19.890\nright in between these numbers right here,\n\n480\n00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:23.453\nwe can get that divide and\nthat's where that separation occurs.\n\n481\n00:25:23.453 --> 00:25:25.910\nAnd so everything to the left\nis part of the network ID, and\n\n482\n00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.850\neverything to the right\nis part of the host ID.\n\n483\n00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:30.990\nIt's a pretty confusing concept,\nright it's pretty difficult and\n\n484\n00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.240\nif this is the first time that\nyou're learning about this,\n\n485\n00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.660\nI really encourage you to jump\nover to our network plus show.\n\n486\n00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.490\nBecause in network plus, I think we\ndid a series of like eight episodes,\n\n487\n00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.700\nthat just really go into depth on this and\nhow it works,\n\n488\n00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.880\nhow you can break up networks and\ncreate your own.\n\n489\n00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.360\nBut If you already know this, just as\na quick review, what you need to know for\n\n490\n00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.750\nthe exam is that when you\nstart moving these 1s,\n\n491\n00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:58.680\nlike we're doing here, you can make\nyour network smaller or bigger.\n\n492\n00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.160\nYou can subnet or supernet, right?\n\n493\n00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.810\nSubnetting is where you take one network\nand break it up into smaller pieces.\n\n494\n00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.230\nSuper netting is when\nyou take one network and\n\n495\n00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.340\ncombine it with another network\nto make a bigger network.\n\n496\n00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.050\nSo let me run through two examples of that\nreal quick before we wrap this episode up.\n\n497\n00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.820\nI want to show you guys sub netting and\nsuper netting.\n\n498\n00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.840\nSo let's say that I've got\na network like 192.168.0.0.\n\n499\n00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.950\nThat would normally give\nme 254 usable IP's and\n\n500\n00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:28.510\nit would be be 192.168.0.1 through 254,\nright?\n\n501\n00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.760\nThose would be the usable\nIP's in that range.\n\n502\n00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.290\nLet's say I wanted to divide it in half\n\n503\n00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:39.940\nI wanna break that in half to\nget two different networks.\n\n504\n00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.890\nAnd those two different networks are just\ndividing this current one into two pieces.\n\n505\n00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.640\nSo it's basically the first half and\nthe second half of this one network.\n\n506\n00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:54.810\nWell the subnet I would normally use\nis 255.255.255.0 for my one network and\n\n507\n00:26:54.810 --> 00:27:00.730\nif I were to write that in binary\nit would look something like this.\n\n508\n00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:04.070\nI think I might have gotten\nan extra 1 in there somewhere.\n\n509\n00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.130\nNo, actually I did it right.\n\n510\n00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.630\nOkay, so\nthat's what that subnet would look like.\n\n511\n00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:14.680\nWell, if I take one extra zero and\nadd it to the network ID,\n\n512\n00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.190\nthat can have two placeholder\nvalues: zero, or a value of one.\n\n513\n00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:20.520\nEffectively creating\ntwo different networks.\n\n514\n00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.620\nOne that has a zero there,\nand one that has a one there.\n\n515\n00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.300\nAnd that starts to create that\ndivision within my network.\n\n516\n00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.559\nAnd that's what is going to allow\nme to divide this into two pieces.\n\n517\n00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:36.510\nSo I'm just gonna basically borrow, or\nsteal, or however you wanna call it,\n\n518\n00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:40.140\nthis extra bit from the host ID and\ngive it to the network ID.\n\n519\n00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:44.090\nNow, the first one that I wrote,\nthis guy, is a /24.\n\n520\n00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:47.990\nThere's 24 ones and zeros.\n\n521\n00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:52.210\nOr I'm sorry, 24 1's before the zero\nstarts, but this next one that I'm making\n\n522\n00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:58.320\nis a slash 25, I'm giving one more bit to\nthe network ID to create a second network.\n\n523\n00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:05.200\nAnd what I end up with and\nI'll save us the time of doing the whole\n\n524\n00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.350\nbinary conversion is two networks,\n192.168.0.0,\n\n525\n00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:12.790\nall the way through 127 and\n192.168.0.128 through 255, right?\n\n526\n00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:20.430\nThose are the two networks\nthat I just made.\n\n527\n00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.260\nI divided it in half.\n\n528\n00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:28.500\nBy stealing this one bit and attaching it\nto network ID, so I've now sub netted,\n\n529\n00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:33.120\nI've divided a network up into multiple\nsmaller pieces and that's useful.\n\n530\n00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.210\nNot so much on private networks like\nthese, we don't normally bother on private\n\n531\n00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:40.920\nbut on a public network if we have public\nIP's that have been assigned to us,\n\n532\n00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.460\nwe can do this to divide what we've\ngot and use them more efficiently.\n\n533\n00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.160\nRight?\n\n534\n00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.690\nSame thing goes for\nsupernetting where I combine networks.\n\n535\n00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:53.160\nLet's say I've got 300 computers.\n\n536\n00:28:53.160 --> 00:29:00.330\nWell, if I use 192.168.0.0 like we did\nup here, well, that's gonna give me 254.\n\n537\n00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:03.170\nBut I need, I need more, right?\n\n538\n00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:04.360\nI need 300.\n\n539\n00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:10.640\nSo if I need 300, Well what I can\ndo is go the opposite direction.\n\n540\n00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:16.830\nInstead of stealing a host bit\nI could steal a network bit.\n\n541\n00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:21.910\nAnd what that's gonna do is it's\ngonna combine two networks.\n\n542\n00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:27.080\nIt will take the 192.168.0.0 network and\ncombine it with the next one in line.\n\n543\n00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:27.710\nWhich is the 192.\n\n544\n00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:28.380\n168. 1. 0 network.\n\n545\n00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:33.070\nAnd we can combine those two\ntogether to create a network that\n\n546\n00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.190\nhas over 500 usable IPs.\n\n547\n00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:39.060\nAnd again I'll save us\nthe binary conversion but\n\n548\n00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.063\nit basically works out to 192.\n\n549\n00:29:42.063 --> 00:29:44.860\n168. 0. 0 All the way\nthrough 192.168.1.255, right.\n\n550\n00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.970\nThat gives you 512 usable\nIPs in that network.\n\n551\n00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:53.600\nThat's supernetting,\nthat's combining, right.\n\n552\n00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.560\nAnd like I said, on private networks,\nwe don't necessarily worry about that.\n\n553\n00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.240\nAlthough you might have\n\n554\n00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.450\na virtual machine network that you want to\nmake a little bigger, and you can do this.\n\n555\n00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.610\nBut on public networks,\nthat's when this becomes really handy.\n\n556\n00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.770\nI've said private and public a few times,\n\n557\n00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.380\nlet's talk about that just real briefly\ncuz it might turn up on the exam.\n\n558\n00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:13.960\nI mentioned how there were Class As,\nClass Bs and Class Cs way up here.\n\n559\n00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.930\nAnd I mentioned how those first OCTEps\nkinda mattered back in the day, right.\n\n560\n00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.730\nWe'll when it comes to public IPs.\n\n561\n00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.730\nThese numbers are the numbers\nthat we see out there, right.\n\n562\n00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.770\nSo basically 1 through\n223 in that first octet.\n\n563\n00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:31.640\nBut there's certain exceptions and\ngaps that occur, so you may or\n\n564\n00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.160\nmay not actually see all these IPs in use.\n\n565\n00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.939\nFor example, on the Class A,\nyou have 10.0.0.0,\n\n566\n00:30:38.939 --> 00:30:42.140\nright, 10 Is a special one.\n\n567\n00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.230\nThat one's private.\n\n568\n00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.450\nEverything else.\n\n569\n00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:52.550\nSo one through nine and 11 through 126,\nthose are all public Class A addresses.\n\n570\n00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.020\nYou can't just use those.\n\n571\n00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.050\nYou have to go to the IANA and\nregister them.\n\n572\n00:30:56.050 --> 00:31:00.360\nYou've got to basically lease them\nfrom the IANA to be able to use them.\n\n573\n00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.650\nYou really lease them from your ISP but\n\n574\n00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.740\neither way, you gotta get those\naddresses and have them registered.\n\n575\n00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.190\nYou will be the only person\non the planet that has those.\n\n576\n00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.760\nBut the private addresses anybody can\nuse those, right, and most people do.\n\n577\n00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.500\nSo 10., that's the private for\nyour class A.\n\n578\n00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.880\nAnd on the class B it's very similar.\n\n579\n00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:24.880\nYou get 128 through 191 but\n172.16 Through 172.31 are reserved,\n\n580\n00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:29.920\nthose are the private ones, right?\n\n581\n00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.680\nSo those are the private addresses.\n\n582\n00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:39.596\nKeep in mind that 172.16.0,\nthat's a public, right?\n\n583\n00:31:39.596 --> 00:31:43.052\n172.16.32, I'm sorry, 172.32,\nthere we go, I can't get it straight.\n\n584\n00:31:43.052 --> 00:31:43.645\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n585\n00:31:43.645 --> 00:31:47.140\n>> 172.0 there we go, that's a public.\n\n586\n00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.740\n172.32, that's a public.\n\n587\n00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.784\n172.15, that's a public.\n\n588\n00:31:51.784 --> 00:31:53.827\n172.16.\n\n589\n00:31:53.827 --> 00:31:55.415\nThat's a private, right?\n\n590\n00:31:55.415 --> 00:31:57.609\nJust that little range inside of there.\n\n591\n00:31:57.609 --> 00:32:00.240\nI wrote it right, but I said it wrong.\n\n592\n00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.280\nSo anyhow, that's the correct site.\n\n593\n00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.835\nAnd then on the Class C, it's easy here,\n\n594\n00:32:04.835 --> 00:32:08.432\njust anything that starts with 192.168,\nright.\n\n595\n00:32:08.432 --> 00:32:13.265\nNow 192.167, that's a public.\n\n596\n00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:14.700\n192.169 is a public, all right.\n\n597\n00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.473\nThose are public IPs\nthat are really usable.\n\n598\n00:32:16.473 --> 00:32:20.124\n192.168 that's the private, right.\n\n599\n00:32:20.124 --> 00:32:25.020\nSo 192.168 Is the private range.\n\n600\n00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.870\nOkay, so each one is a private range set\naside and those are defined in an RFC.\n\n601\n00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:31.440\nIf you wanna learn more about it,\nRFC 1918, you can look it up.\n\n602\n00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.410\nIt's a terribly boring read but it'll\ntell you how these were set aside for\n\n603\n00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:36.220\nprivate use.\n\n604\n00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.260\nAnd when we're creating\nvirtual machine networks,\n\n605\n00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.450\nwe're normally using\nthese private addresses.\n\n606\n00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.568\nBut you don't have to.\n\n607\n00:32:42.568 --> 00:32:47.192\nIf you look back at my virtual\nmachine configuration.\n\n608\n00:32:47.192 --> 00:32:50.132\nLet me just unlock this again so\nit'll actually be legible.\n\n609\n00:32:50.132 --> 00:32:50.852\nWhoops.\n\n610\n00:32:50.852 --> 00:32:54.392\nIf I figure out my password.\n\n611\n00:32:54.392 --> 00:32:58.393\nNotice how here in vmnet 3,\nI'm using 192.168.0.0.\n\n612\n00:32:58.393 --> 00:32:59.193\nIt's a private address range.\n\n613\n00:32:59.193 --> 00:33:00.872\nI can use that to my heart's content.\n\n614\n00:33:00.872 --> 00:33:04.613\nOr vmnet4, 192.168.1.0.\n\n615\n00:33:04.613 --> 00:33:06.280\n172.16.0.0.\n\n616\n00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.680\nSo I'm using all these private ranges.\n\n617\n00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.886\nBut if you look at my vmnet2,\nwhat is that?\n\n618\n00:33:11.886 --> 00:33:18.198\n209.251.159.176 and\nit's a 255.255.255.240.\n\n619\n00:33:18.198 --> 00:33:20.078\nThat's a public range, right.\n\n620\n00:33:20.078 --> 00:33:23.260\nIt's not just a public range,\nit's the range for our studio here.\n\n621\n00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.040\nWhy do I have that?\n\n622\n00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.410\nWell, I use it for testing.\n\n623\n00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.390\nIf I wanna test something and I don't\nwanna impact my production environment,\n\n624\n00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:32.060\nI might wanna bring up\nsome VMs right here and\n\n625\n00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.230\nI do it in that IP range, the same IP\nrange that I use in the public network.\n\n626\n00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.320\nNow they overlap, so these hosts\ncan't get out to the Internet right.\n\n627\n00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.600\nThey're stuck here and\nnobody will know how to get back to them.\n\n628\n00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.130\nBut for testing a restore of a server or\ntesting some kind of dev change,\n\n629\n00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.730\nyou can do it right here and\nit works out pretty well.\n\n630\n00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:51.970\nSo you can use public IPs in your network\nconfiguration, you just have to be careful\n\n631\n00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:55.940\nwith it because you are overlapping\nreal networks that are out there and,\n\n632\n00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.270\nif it's your own network,\nit's fine, it's great for testing.\n\n633\n00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:59.810\nBut if it's somebody else's network,\n\n634\n00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:01.630\nthen you won't be able to\naccess their services anymore.\n\n635\n00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.110\nAll right.\n\n636\n00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:06.740\nWell, I think that's\na pretty good run down\n\n637\n00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.120\nof the IP address structure and\nsubnetting.\n\n638\n00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.460\nI did it pretty quick, right?\n\n639\n00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.080\nI ran through just some\nreal quick examples.\n\n640\n00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.490\nThis should be stuff you guys\nare already familiar with.\n\n641\n00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:19.020\nIf you're not, like I said,\njump over to Network+.\n\n642\n00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:23.150\nHere we're spending one 30 minute episode\non it, but over on Network+, we spent like\n\n643\n00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:27.060\neight 30 minute episodes, I mean we really\nwent in depth on how all this stuff works,\n\n644\n00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.040\nthe ins and the outs, ran through many,\nmany example problems.\n\n645\n00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.800\nRonnie, you were there too.\n\n646\n00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.720\nSo lots of example problems on those.\n\n647\n00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.030\nDefinitely worth a watch\nif you wanna see it.\n\n648\n00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.030\nOn the exam, they really,\nfor Cloud+, at least,\n\n649\n00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.695\nthey want you to know the difference\nbetween private and public ranges, right,\n\n650\n00:34:41.695 --> 00:34:45.720\ncuz that's important and they want you\nto be able to interpret a subnet mask.\n\n651\n00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.136\nSo know whether an IP is on the same\nnetwork as another IP based on\n\n652\n00:34:49.136 --> 00:34:50.360\nthe subnet mask.\n\n653\n00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.140\nYou need to understand what those are,\nright.\n\n654\n00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.560\nSo don't expect to have\nto do anything too crazy.\n\n655\n00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.370\nI doubt you'll see any subnetting or\n\n656\n00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:00.230\nsupernetting beyond just the basic concept\nof what it is, but it can turn up,\n\n657\n00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.710\nit is an exam objective, so\nwe wanted to make sure that we covered it.\n\n658\n00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.100\n>> All right, Don.\nWell thank you again for\n\n659\n00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.170\nshowing us those demonstrations.\n\n660\n00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.480\nAny last words here?\n\n661\n00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.860\n>> All right,\nwell we covered a lot on subnetting and\n\n662\n00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.920\nsome different concepts there.\n\n663\n00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.190\nI already mentioned the Network+\nshow definitely check it out.\n\n664\n00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.810\nWe are gonna do one more episode\non network concepts though,\n\n665\n00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.470\ncuz I wanna talk about network address\ntranslation and port address translation.\n\n666\n00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.960\nThe NAT option is is always present\ninside of virtualization software so\n\n667\n00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.350\nwe need to understand what NAT is,\n\n668\n00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:27.580\nhow it works, what your virtualization\nplatform is using it for.\n\n669\n00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.700\nSo we'll get a chance to see that,\n\n670\n00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.640\nI want to talk a little bit\nabout network bridging, too.\n\n671\n00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.360\nSo that's all gonna come\nup in our next episode.\n\n672\n00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.020\n>> Well excellent, it's a great reminder\nhow important the networking concepts\n\n673\n00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:40.290\nreally are, not only in our on premises\nnetwork, but in the cloud as well.\n\n674\n00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.530\nGreat place for us to go and\nend this episode.\n\n675\n00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.220\nSigning off for ITPro TV I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n676\n00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:45.890\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n677\n00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.487\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n678\n00:35:48.487 --> 00:35:56.140\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.902\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:21.388\ntoday we're gonna be taking\na look at the CompTIA Cloud+.\n\n5\n00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.950\nWe're specifically gonna be diving into\nthe world of networking concepts and\n\n6\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.100\nthis is a part two, which means we're\ncontinuing on with the previous episode\n\n7\n00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.090\nand we're talking about some more\ndetails that we need to understand.\n\n8\n00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.370\nWho better to help us than Mr.\nDon Pizet, Don how's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.410\n>> It is going great Ronnie,\n\n10\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.410\nready to jump right back into the world\nof Cloud+ and in the last episode,\n\n11\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.010\nwe spent some time talking about some\nreally general network concepts.\n\n12\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.530\nWe talked about sub-netting, and\n\n13\n00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.345\nI know that's not the most\nfun thing in the world.\n\n14\n00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But these are basic network\n\n15\n00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.460\ntechnologies that the company wants you to\nbe familiar with before you take the exam.\n\n16\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.960\nWe're gonna continue on with that with\nsomething that's a little bit more fun.\n\n17\n00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.730\nWe're gonna talk about network address\ntranslation, NAT, and how it's used inside\n\n18\n00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.250\nof a virtual environment and we're gonna\ntalk a little bit about the common ports\n\n19\n00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.440\nand protocols before you take the exam\nbecause they can turn up on the questions.\n\n20\n00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.000\nThat's kinda what we've got lined up for\nthis episode.\n\n21\n00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.900\n>> So Don, I remember one of the very\nfirst questions I had when I started my\n\n22\n00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.420\nnetworking career is the use of public and\nprivate IP addresses and\n\n23\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.940\nhow those end up working together.\n\n24\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.478\nWe're really gonna be diving in a little\nbit, I don't want to say too deep.\n\n25\n00:01:21.478 --> 00:01:26.140\nBut we're gonna be diving into that area\nwhere we can take private IP addresses and\n\n26\n00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.480\nmake sure that they can\nbe used on the Internet.\n\n27\n00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.700\n>> Yeah, so when you're setting\nup a virtual environment,\n\n28\n00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.380\nI know I showed this in the last episode\nwhere I brought up the VMware Fusion where\n\n29\n00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.920\nyou start to create these virtual\nnetworks for your machine to reside on.\n\n30\n00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.605\nWell you're almost always gonna\nuse private networks for those.\n\n31\n00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:46.100\nSo you'll see those networks like 192.168,\nwhatever or\n\n32\n00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.493\n172.16 through 172.31, whatever or\n10, whatever, those IP\n\n33\n00:01:51.493 --> 00:01:57.560\naddresses,those are private IP ranges set\naside by RFC 1918 for your private use.\n\n34\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.850\nAnd you can use them to\nyour heart's content.\n\n35\n00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.710\nYou don't have to register them.\n\n36\n00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.860\nAnd that's why we use them so\n\n37\n00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.630\nmuch in a virtual environment,\ncuz you create a lot of machines.\n\n38\n00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.220\nYou don't necessarily want to\nhave public IPs everywhere.\n\n39\n00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.930\nBut RFC 1918 addresses, private addresses,\nare not routable on the Internet.\n\n40\n00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.420\nYou use an Internet service provider.\n\n41\n00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.050\nThe ISPs are required as\na part of their charter\n\n42\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.170\nto drop any traffic on\nthose private networks.\n\n43\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.070\nThey're not allowed to transmit\nit out to the Internet.\n\n44\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.610\nEven if they did,\nyou wouldn't get very far.\n\n45\n00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.540\nYou might get to your destination, but\nyour destination wouldn't be able to\n\n46\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.400\nget back to you cuz they're\nnot gonna route it back.\n\n47\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.960\nSo they're not using a lot\nthere on the Internet.\n\n48\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.350\nAs a result, if you want your virtual\nmachines to have Internet access, and\n\n49\n00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.830\nthey've got private IPs,\n\n50\n00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.470\nthey're going to have to do network\naddress translation somewhere.\n\n51\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.900\nNow, where that somewhere\nis kind of depends.\n\n52\n00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.120\nThat somewhere might be,\nthat might be on a physical firewall or\n\n53\n00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.815\nrouter on your on your network.\n\n54\n00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:55.165\nYou might have physical equipment on your\nnetwork that takes your private IP's and\n\n55\n00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:58.905\ntranslates them, but\nyou can also do that translation\n\n56\n00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:02.735\nright inside of your virtual machine,\nyour virtualization software.\n\n57\n00:03:02.735 --> 00:03:07.505\nSo if you've got ESX,\nif you've got Hyper V or VMware Fusion or\n\n58\n00:03:07.505 --> 00:03:11.720\nwhatever they all support doing network\naddress translation in the software, too.\n\n59\n00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.230\nAnd that can be pretty handy.\n\n60\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.370\nIt's not all that handy on\nthe type-1 hypervisors,\n\n61\n00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.680\nlike on Hyper-V, on VMware, VSX.\n\n62\n00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.510\nThose environments usually do have\nphysical hardware doing the routing.\n\n63\n00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.960\nSo if you think about,\n\n64\n00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.890\nyou're probably using private IPs\nthroughout your entire environment.\n\n65\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.750\nSo you've probably got private\nIPs assigned to your desktop,\n\n66\n00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.610\nyour network printers, your other devices.\n\n67\n00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.590\nAnd so you've got something in place\nthat's doing network address translation\n\n68\n00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.920\nfor those guys so\nthey can get out to the Internet.\n\n69\n00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.640\nSo in your virtualization structure\nyou just use the same thing.\n\n70\n00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.710\nWhy reinvent the wheel?\n\n71\n00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.630\nWhy have a second layer of\nnet when you don't need it?\n\n72\n00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.420\nAnd you just have your virtual machines\nget translated the same way as your\n\n73\n00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.010\nphysical machines.\n\n74\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.920\nBut if your virtualization platform is\nportable, like mine here on my laptop,\n\n75\n00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.950\nwhen I have a virtual machine\nrunning here at the office and\n\n76\n00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.440\nthen I go home,\nthe virtual machine's IP changes, right.\n\n77\n00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.300\nCuz it's a different network.\n\n78\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.990\nI might want to hide that\nfrom the virtual machine.\n\n79\n00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.110\nI don't want the virtual machine to\nknow that it's on a different network.\n\n80\n00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.530\nAnd this is really handy for\nthings like portable systems.\n\n81\n00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.240\nBut even on non-portable systems,\n\n82\n00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.180\nif you're doing things\nlike testing a recovery.\n\n83\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.970\nLet's say that in my production\nenvironment I've got an email server.\n\n84\n00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.320\nAnd the email server is 209.159.121.179 or\nsomething like that.\n\n85\n00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.068\nThat's a public IP.\n\n86\n00:04:27.068 --> 00:04:28.763\nIt's a real IP.\n\n87\n00:04:28.763 --> 00:04:30.423\nI want to test a restore.\n\n88\n00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:34.550\nSo I want to restore that email\nserver to a virtual machine.\n\n89\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.081\nWell when I restore it,\nit's gonna have the same IP, isn't it?\n\n90\n00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:40.220\nI'm gonna have a duplicate IP on\nthe network and I'll get a failure.\n\n91\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.710\nOr, I could put it on\na virtual network and\n\n92\n00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.010\nI could translate that virtual network,\nI could NAT it to a different address.\n\n93\n00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.750\nAnd now even though that server's got the\nsame IP as something in use somewhere else\n\n94\n00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.440\non the network, it's not a problem\nanymore cuz I'm translating it.\n\n95\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.469\nSo you can use it to hide IPs,\nwhich is great for\n\n96\n00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.509\ntesting restores in\nenvironments like that.\n\n97\n00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.430\nWell, I've mentioned NAT a few times.\n\n98\n00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.190\nLet's talk a little bit about how\nnetwork address translation works and\n\n99\n00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.050\nhow that comes into play.\n\n100\n00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.680\nSo I've got an example topology here.\n\n101\n00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.660\nAnd my example topology\nbreaks down like this.\n\n102\n00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.039\nOn the left side of my network, I've got\na private network range, 192.168.0.0/24.\n\n103\n00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:22.101\nAll right, and that's a private\nrange that I might be using for\n\n104\n00:05:22.101 --> 00:05:24.880\nvirtualization or for anything.\n\n105\n00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.890\nIn the middle,\nI've got a firewall or a router.\n\n106\n00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.014\nAnd then on the outside I've got my public\nIP range, 209.251.159.176/28, right.\n\n107\n00:05:34.014 --> 00:05:37.460\nThat's the studio network here.\n\n108\n00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.070\nSo in this environment these private IPs\nare not allowed to go out to the Internet,\n\n109\n00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.860\nthey're not allowed to go out\nhere because they're private IPs.\n\n110\n00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.480\nSo the device that's in between\nthem has to do the translation.\n\n111\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.400\nOn a normal network this is a router or\na firewall.\n\n112\n00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.650\nBut in a virtualized environment this is\ntypically your virtualization platform, be\n\n113\n00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.920\nit ESX or Amazon Web Services, Microsoft\nAzure, they all do the same basic concept.\n\n114\n00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.150\nYou spin up a machine.\n\n115\n00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.350\nIt gets an address that's private.\n\n116\n00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.150\nAnd then we have to translate\nit to become public.\n\n117\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.100\nSo this can be any number of things.\n\n118\n00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.500\nWell, what it's gonna do,\n\n119\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.130\nis it's going to take a look at our\ntraffic as it exits our network.\n\n120\n00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.120\nSo when we communicate from that\ninternal host to somebody outside,\n\n121\n00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.680\nwe've got to translate it.\n\n122\n00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.380\nSo, for example, here.\n\n123\n00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.250\nIf I've got a host on the inside, and\nlet's say that it is 192.168.0.173.\n\n124\n00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.910\nSo that's a host inside of my network, and\n\n125\n00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.900\nit's gonna be communicating to\nsomebody out there on the internet.\n\n126\n00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.264\nMaybe we're trying to ping\nGoogle's DNS server, so\n\n127\n00:06:43.264 --> 00:06:46.040\nGoogle has a DNS server at 8.8.8.8.\n\n128\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.740\nAll right, nice and easy to remember.\n\n129\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.400\nSo we've got traffic that's\ncoming from 192.168.0.173 and\n\n130\n00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.690\nit's going to 8.8.8.8 all right?\n\n131\n00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.870\nWell as that crosses the network,\n\n132\n00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.990\nif I were to send this out to\nthe Internet, just like this, right?\n\n133\n00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.490\nSo if I were to send it out unchanged\nright out onto the Internet,\n\n134\n00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.330\nthe Internet routers that are out there.\n\n135\n00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.610\nThe ISP are gonna see 192.168.0 and\nthey're gonna throw the traffic away.\n\n136\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.270\nNope, not routable, trash it.\n\n137\n00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.130\nRight, they'll throw it away before it\neven leaves the Internet service provider,\n\n138\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.640\nor at least they should.\n\n139\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.950\nIn the event that they completely screw up\nand don't, it goes out on the Internet.\n\n140\n00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.350\nIt'll get all the way to 8.8.8, and\nthen Google's gonna try and reply and\n\n141\n00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.330\nsay, that's a private network.\n\n142\n00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.280\nIt's right here.\n\n143\n00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.650\nAnd they're gonna throw it away, right?\n\n144\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.550\nSo it's just not gonna\nmake it back to you.\n\n145\n00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.990\nSo it's not routable traffic.\n\n146\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.300\nSo what we have to do is in the middle.\n\n147\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.660\nIn the middle of this whole process,\nwe've got to come in and\n\n148\n00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.067\nbasically change that traffic.\n\n149\n00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:52.016\nWe've gotta change it into something\nthat is able to be routed, and\n\n150\n00:07:52.016 --> 00:07:54.510\nsent along, and able to be moved.\n\n151\n00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.260\nAnd the technology that does that Is nat.\n\n152\n00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.633\nAnd nat runs on the router or\nfirewall in between and\n\n153\n00:08:01.633 --> 00:08:05.558\nif your virtualization platform\nis acting as that router or\n\n154\n00:08:05.558 --> 00:08:11.340\nfirewall then it's your virtualization\nplatform that has to do the translation.\n\n155\n00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.330\nSo it's going to be the one\nthat's performing this role.\n\n156\n00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:20.450\nAnd you might have noticed that in my\nsettings, so this is the emerfusion.\n\n157\n00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.480\nAnd if I go into my settings and\n\n158\n00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.330\nunder Network,\nhere's all my virtual machine networks.\n\n159\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:33.790\nAnd I've got vmnet3 which\nI'm going to unlock here.\n\n160\n00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.630\nSo here's my virtual machine network 3 and\nit's got a subnet IP of 192.168.0.0.\n\n161\n00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.770\nWhen I boot up a virtual machine,\nit's gonna get an address in that network.\n\n162\n00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.720\nBut that's not a routable address.\n\n163\n00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.000\nAnd so it's gives me the option up here.\n\n164\n00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000\nAllow virtual machines on this network\nto connect to external networks,\n\n165\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.060\nusing Network Address Translation.\n\n166\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:59.370\nMy virtualization software will do the\ntranslation to make this a real IP, right.\n\n167\n00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.960\nNow if I've already got hardware\non my network that does it,\n\n168\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.860\nthen what I would is I wouldn't\ndo a virtual network at all.\n\n169\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.090\nI would do bridging.\n\n170\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.980\nBridged network is where I say,\nyou know what,\n\n171\n00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.910\njust put my virtual machines on\nthe real network with my other stuff.\n\n172\n00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.080\nSo my laptop for example is plugged\ninto my Thunderbolt ethernet adapter, or\n\n173\n00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.070\nmaybe I'm on wi-fi or whatever.\n\n174\n00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.810\nSo I can say, you know what, just\nattach my virtual machine to that too.\n\n175\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.510\nAnd it'll get an IP address\nfrom my local network and\n\n176\n00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.880\nit'll get Natted by out\nfirewall here at the building.\n\n177\n00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.610\nRight so it'll get Natted that way and\nget out to the internet.\n\n178\n00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:35.050\nBut if we choose these options down\nhere our software has to Natted.\n\n179\n00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.240\nAnd this is the same in any\nvirtualization platform.\n\n180\n00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.980\nThey've all got this\nfunctionality in there.\n\n181\n00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.440\nYou know the settings might look\ndifferent but what they do is the same.\n\n182\n00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.240\nAnd what we're doing is we're\ntelling the virtualization platform,\n\n183\n00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.300\nhey when that traffic passes\nthrough here We need to change it.\n\n184\n00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.100\nNow what we change it to can depend.\n\n185\n00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.290\nAll right?\n\n186\n00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:58.670\nOur virtualization platform might\nhave a public IP assigned to it let's\n\n187\n00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.404\nsay it's .177 all right 209.251.159.177.\n\n188\n00:10:01.404 --> 00:10:05.120\nSo then what we would do is we would\ntranslate these virtual machines\n\n189\n00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.630\nto that IP.\n\n190\n00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.470\nThat's called Dynamic Mapping, where we\nhave more than one host all mapped behind\n\n191\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.670\na single IP, and\nthat's what my laptop is doing.\n\n192\n00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.510\nWe don't normally want\nthat on the servers.\n\n193\n00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.280\nI'll explain why here in a second.\n\n194\n00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.040\nJust to keep the example simple,\nlet's say that we're doing this.\n\n195\n00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.450\nAs the traffic passes through,\nwhat your firewall, router, or\n\n196\n00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.360\nvirtualization platform is doing,\nis taking that source address and\n\n197\n00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.120\nit's changing it into\na real address like this.\n\n198\n00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.140\nAll right.\n\n199\n00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:39.806\nSo now when the traffic was first created\nit had a source of 192.168.0.173 by\n\n200\n00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:46.000\nvirtual machine and had a destination\nof 8.8.8.8, which was Google.\n\n201\n00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.720\nAs it exited the virtualization software,\nit gets translated, and\n\n202\n00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.800\nit gives it a source of,\nusually the virtualization platform or\n\n203\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.580\nwhatever IP it is that we're using there.\n\n204\n00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.800\nSo in my case 209.251.159.177, and\nthe destination stays the same.\n\n205\n00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.920\nIt's still Google.\n\n206\n00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.510\nBut now I've got a good IP, and\nI can go out on the Internet, and\n\n207\n00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.780\ni can reach out to Google.\n\n208\n00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.440\nAnd Google can reply back to me.\n\n209\n00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.760\nNow, when the reply comes back in,\nour virtualization software, or\n\n210\n00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.350\nfirewall router, has to figure\nout where to send this traffic.\n\n211\n00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.670\nAnd it maintains a table,\n\n212\n00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.380\na translation table that says,\nI'm getting a response back from Google,\n\n213\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.370\nthat was this guy over here,\nthat was this source, or this destination.\n\n214\n00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.980\nThat's where that came from.\n\n215\n00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.770\nIts got to keep track of that.\n\n216\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.960\nAnd the way it keeps track of\nthat is through port numbers.\n\n217\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.310\nThe port numbers are really important.\n\n218\n00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.190\nAny network communication\nuses a port number, right?\n\n219\n00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:47.090\nSo, for example, when I reach out to any\nof these hosts, let's say this is a DNS.\n\n220\n00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:52.400\nRight, if I'm doing a DNS lookup, there's\na source port that's assigned, all right.\n\n221\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.500\nAnd the source port is\ngenerally randomly generated.\n\n222\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:02.440\nAnd so it can be a big number, big enough\nfor me to run out of space apparently.\n\n223\n00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.050\nSo let me make these\nguys a little bit bigger.\n\n224\n00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.750\nSo that'll fit.\n\n225\n00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.680\nThere we go.\n\n226\n00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.590\nAll right, so it'll be something nice and\nbig like that.\n\n227\n00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:14.940\nSo I've got 192.168.0.173:50111, right?\n\n228\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.980\nThat's the port number that I\ngenerated as my source port.\n\n229\n00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.720\nAnd then the destination,\nport 53, all right?\n\n230\n00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.160\nWhat do those numbers mean?\n\n231\n00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.110\nWell the numbers are important for\nthe exam.\n\n232\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.290\nWhen you look at port numbers.\n\n233\n00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.220\nShoot, I thought I had a different slide.\n\n234\n00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.040\nWell, I don't have it.\n\n235\n00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.650\nAll right, well, anyhow, when you\nlook at those port numbers, right,\n\n236\n00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.580\nthis is not the slide that I wanted,\nbut it will work, when you look at\n\n237\n00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.980\nthese port numbers, there's usually going\nto be one number that's really big.\n\n238\n00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.180\nAnd one number that's small, right?\n\n239\n00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.370\nNot always but it's usually like this and\n\n240\n00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:51.410\nwhen you send out your traffic, you have\na source port and a destination port and\n\n241\n00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.635\nwhen somebody on the other end replies,\nthey're flipping those around.\n\n242\n00:12:54.635 --> 00:12:59.365\nAround, so the destination port becomes\nthe source port, because it's a reply.\n\n243\n00:12:59.365 --> 00:13:03.865\nThink about it as if you mail a letter to\nsomebody, you've got a return address and\n\n244\n00:13:03.865 --> 00:13:05.385\na destination address.\n\n245\n00:13:05.385 --> 00:13:07.187\nAnd if they send you a physical mail,\n\n246\n00:13:07.187 --> 00:13:10.377\nmail back,\nthen the return address becomes them.\n\n247\n00:13:10.377 --> 00:13:12.187\nRight, because it's coming from them now.\n\n248\n00:13:12.187 --> 00:13:13.107\nSo they flip it around.\n\n249\n00:13:13.107 --> 00:13:14.577\nAnd that's what's happening.\n\n250\n00:13:14.577 --> 00:13:17.007\nBut the port numbers themselves\nare a little bit special.\n\n251\n00:13:17.007 --> 00:13:19.307\nThere's actually ranges of these ports.\n\n252\n00:13:19.307 --> 00:13:22.718\nSo, for example,\n\n253\n00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:28.910\nif we take our here, port ranges.\n\n254\n00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.610\nWe'll just make this up since\nI don't have a slide for it.\n\n255\n00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.580\nMy port ranges,\nthe basically work like this.\n\n256\n00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.300\nNumber one through 1024.\n\n257\n00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.600\nThose are registered, or actually\nthey're called well-known port numbers.\n\n258\n00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.470\nWe'll just say Well-Known Port Numbers.\n\n259\n00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.570\nAll right, so\nthose are well known port numbers.\n\n260\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.670\nThe IANA which is,\nhelp me out here, what is it?\n\n261\n00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.170\nInternet Authority for\nNumbering and Addressing.\n\n262\n00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.010\n>> Assignment?\nYeah-\n\n263\n00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:55.510\n>> Assignment.\n\n264\n00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.530\nI think you're right, yup.\n\n265\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.610\n>> So, the IANA, they're the guys\nwho assigned these port numbers.\n\n266\n00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.530\nAnd 1 through a 1024, those are pretty\nwell locked in place, right?\n\n267\n00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.870\nThose are the ones that are very commonly\nknown and they're tied to protocols,\n\n268\n00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.940\nthings like HTTP for\nweb traffic or talmed,\n\n269\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.860\nSSH things like, they're well defined and\nthey're in that range and\n\n270\n00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.240\nthat's why our say our destination\nport is usually a small number,\n\n271\n00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.720\ncause it's normally in this range.\n\n272\n00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.820\nThen, we have 1025 through do you\nremember what the cut off is?\n\n273\n00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.320\nIt's\n>> 49151.\n\n274\n00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.020\n>> How you know these things is amazing.\n\n275\n00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.180\nSo 1025 through 49151 those\nare called Registered Ports,\n\n276\n00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.570\nthere we go.\n\n277\n00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.120\nThose ports while technically\nanybody can use them.\n\n278\n00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.710\nIdeally you'll register them with the INA\nto let them know that you are using\n\n279\n00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.320\nthem, right.\n\n280\n00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.190\nSo they try and keep a, kind of\na listing of all these port numbers and\n\n281\n00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.030\nwhen their used.\n\n282\n00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.178\nAnd then lastly,\nwe've got 49152 all the way to the end.\n\n283\n00:14:54.178 --> 00:14:55.360\nWhich is 65,535.\n\n284\n00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.790\nThese are the dynamic ports.\n\n285\n00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:02.670\nThese are the ones that\nanybody can use for anything.\n\n286\n00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.300\nRight?\n\n287\n00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.080\nThey're just wide open.\n\n288\n00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.830\nAnd so when we start talking on\nthe network, let's make this look pretty.\n\n289\n00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:10.500\nThere.\n\n290\n00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.600\nWhen we start talking on the network our\nsource port, the one that we're using\n\n291\n00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.960\nwill normally be in this dynamic range,\nand that's why they're big numbers and\n\n292\n00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.380\nour destination ports will normally\nbe in the well known range,\n\n293\n00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.400\nthat's why they're small numbers.\n\n294\n00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.220\nSo it's normally a big\nnumber to a small number.\n\n295\n00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.172\nBut they don't have to be,\nit could be big numbers to big numbers,\n\n296\n00:15:28.172 --> 00:15:32.195\nit could be all sorts of things,\nbut it's usually like this, and so\n\n297\n00:15:32.195 --> 00:15:37.135\nthat's what I'm trying to convey here in\nthis slide is my source traffic might have\n\n298\n00:15:37.135 --> 00:15:42.741\na source port of 53,914 and a destination\nport of 80, 80 I'm going to a web server.\n\n299\n00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:47.283\nAnd when that webserver responds\nit's responding to me on\n\n300\n00:15:47.283 --> 00:15:51.741\n59,000 53,914 but its source is 480.\n\n301\n00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:53.065\nRight?\nThat's that web traffic.\n\n302\n00:15:53.065 --> 00:15:55.015\nSo these port numbers\nare pretty important.\n\n303\n00:15:55.015 --> 00:15:58.135\nIt's almost like a pun, right, important.\n\n304\n00:15:58.135 --> 00:15:59.644\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:15:59.644 --> 00:16:01.550\n>> I know, it just gets worse.\n\n306\n00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.670\nSo they are pretty important.\n\n307\n00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.570\nThey're also important just\nin your own use, right.\n\n308\n00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:11.101\nSo for example, let's say I fire up\nSafari, right, which I don't normally use,\n\n309\n00:16:11.101 --> 00:16:12.319\nbut I'll fire it up anyway.\n\n310\n00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:17.049\nAnd I'm going to go to, right here,\nI guess we go to ITPro.TV, right?\n\n311\n00:16:17.049 --> 00:16:18.082\nSo I'll go to our website.\n\n312\n00:16:18.082 --> 00:16:19.032\nSo I'm going to go to ITProTV.\n\n313\n00:16:19.032 --> 00:16:20.340\nHere's the ITProTV home page.\n\n314\n00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:26.800\nAnd then I'm going to open another tab and\non this tab I'm gonna go to ITPRO.TV.\n\n315\n00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.950\nSo now I've got ITProTV\nopen in two different tabs.\n\n316\n00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.390\nI browsed from my computer to\ntheir website to our website and\n\n317\n00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.445\nI did it in two different tabs.\n\n318\n00:16:36.445 --> 00:16:38.980\nAnd I'm looking at it two different ways,\nright?\n\n319\n00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.630\nNow if I click a link, so\nlet's say I wanna watch the show live, so\n\n320\n00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.670\nI click on On Air, right.\n\n321\n00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:50.590\nThis tab is going to the live page, but my\nother tab is still showing the home page.\n\n322\n00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.909\nNow how did it know which\ntab to send that to?\n\n323\n00:16:53.909 --> 00:16:57.216\nIt knows because when we\nsent that traffic out,\n\n324\n00:16:57.216 --> 00:17:02.683\nthis tab went out with a source port\nnumber that differs from this tab, right.\n\n325\n00:17:02.683 --> 00:17:04.830\nThey have different source port numbers.\n\n326\n00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:06.740\nAnd it's those port numbers\nthat are letting us tell\n\n327\n00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.678\nthese two connections apart.\n\n328\n00:17:08.678 --> 00:17:13.920\nAnd I don't know if I remember off hand,\nbut in UNIX,\n\n329\n00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:20.610\nI'm pretty sure we just say, netstat-an.\n\n330\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:23.838\nAnd let's see if we can't\nfind that connection.\n\n331\n00:17:23.838 --> 00:17:28.458\nYou know what here,\nlet's see if I can't figure this out.\n\n332\n00:17:28.458 --> 00:17:33.567\nI'll do a quick look up for ITPro.TV.\n\n333\n00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:39.080\nAnd we'll do a net stat and\nwe'll grab that for 192.124.249.2.\n\n334\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.160\nSo what I'm doing is I'm looking for\nthe connections to ITProTV.\n\n335\n00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.100\nAnd I should see that I\nhave two connections.\n\n336\n00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.850\nNow connections don't stay open forever so\neventually it will go away but\n\n337\n00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.962\nthis is gonna search and return them.\n\n338\n00:17:49.962 --> 00:17:54.079\nI forgot the an, so\nnow it's doing the full DNS resolution.\n\n339\n00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:55.120\nLet's cut that out.\n\n340\n00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.810\nAnd there we go.\n\n341\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.681\nAnd so here's all these connections\nthat I've opened to ITProTV and\n\n342\n00:18:00.681 --> 00:18:04.030\nthere's actually a bunch of them,\nright, who knows why.\n\n343\n00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.718\nProbably the various images and all\nthose things that are being loaded, but\n\n344\n00:18:07.718 --> 00:18:10.145\nsee how my source is 10.1.230.195.\n\n345\n00:18:10.145 --> 00:18:17.120\nThat's my laptop, and port 52,\n471, 472, 473, and so on.\n\n346\n00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.815\nBut my destination,\nI know 192 seems like a private IP, right?\n\n347\n00:18:21.815 --> 00:18:22.870\nBut it's not 192.168.\n\n348\n00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:27.794\nIt's 192.124.249.2 on port 443, right.\n\n349\n00:18:27.794 --> 00:18:30.394\n443 is secure HTTP.\n\n350\n00:18:30.394 --> 00:18:33.190\nThese are all my connections that\nI've opened up to that site.\n\n351\n00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.310\nThese might be different tabs,\n\n352\n00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:37.400\nthey might be different elements\non the page that are being loaded.\n\n353\n00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.210\nAll of these are different parts\nof my connection to that server.\n\n354\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.380\nAnd so your workstation has to\nkeep track of this stuff already,\n\n355\n00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.630\njust on its own it's\ngotta keep track of it.\n\n356\n00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:52.010\nBut it's really handy because whatever's\ndoing that on your system, which again,\n\n357\n00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:56.260\nit might be your virtualization software,\nit can use those port numbers too.\n\n358\n00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.760\nSo when we get a reply from the outside,\nwhen Google replies on this IP,\n\n359\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.760\nthe software that's doing the translation\ncan look at that port number and\n\n360\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.550\nsay, I'm getting traffic\nback on port 50111,\n\n361\n00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:12.230\nthat needs to go back to this source,\nright, this particular person.\n\n362\n00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.924\n>> Now, Don, we actually have a question\nin our chat room about where does MAC fit\n\n363\n00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:23.305\ninto the picture of this and is there\na problem with MAC being the issue with\n\n364\n00:19:23.305 --> 00:19:28.553\nthe MAC address, excuse me, being the same\nwith MAC and something that happens there.\n\n365\n00:19:28.553 --> 00:19:31.340\n>> Yeah, so on the MAC address side,\nremember whenever you\n\n366\n00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.595\ncreate a virtual machine it\ndynamically generates a MAC address,\n\n367\n00:19:34.595 --> 00:19:37.665\neven if you bridge it with\nyour network adapter, right?\n\n368\n00:19:37.665 --> 00:19:39.190\nIt's always going to do that.\n\n369\n00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.520\nNow, I'll just show you an example.\n\n370\n00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.220\nSo let me take my laptop here.\n\n371\n00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.122\nAnd on my laptop,\nI am gonna do an IF config.\n\n372\n00:19:47.122 --> 00:19:51.341\nAnd I'm gonna hunt down my\nphysical network adapter,\n\n373\n00:19:51.341 --> 00:19:54.010\nwhich is my Thunderbolt adapter.\n\n374\n00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.910\nI have so many adapters in this thing.\n\n375\n00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:02.650\nLet's see, I guess that's gonna be,\nit's not en 0, en 0 is my wireless.\n\n376\n00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.590\nWhere is my, actually here,\nlet's go a different way.\n\n377\n00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.180\nGo into System Preferences and\nI'm gonna find,\n\n378\n00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.850\nI'm gonna figure out\nwhat my MAC address is.\n\n379\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.180\nThat's gonna be our start and so\n\n380\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:17.590\nwhen I take my Thunderbolt adapter and go\ninto my hardware, there we go, all right.\n\n381\n00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:24.956\nSo my Thunderbolt adapter on my\nlaptop has 38:c9:86:02:8a:85, right?\n\n382\n00:20:24.956 --> 00:20:28.369\nThere's the Mac address of\nmy physical network adapter.\n\n383\n00:20:28.369 --> 00:20:32.390\nBut if I take a virtual machine,\nlike this Windows 7 box, all right?\n\n384\n00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.450\nAnd I'm gonna take this machine, and\nI'm gonna put it so it's bridged.\n\n385\n00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.320\nSo I'm going to bridge it across.\n\n386\n00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.640\nLet me go to my network adapter.\n\n387\n00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.140\nAnd I'm going to do bridging, right.\n\n388\n00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.030\nAnd so when I bridge that one.\n\n389\n00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.410\nActually you know what, let me bridge\nit to the Thunderbolt adapter.\n\n390\n00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:52.000\nI want to make sure I'm actually bridged\nto that Thunderbolt adapter, all right.\n\n391\n00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.654\nSo when I bridge that,\nwhat's gonna happen is,\n\n392\n00:20:54.654 --> 00:20:59.240\nI'm now gonna be plugged into that\nsame physical network as my laptop.\n\n393\n00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.715\nMy laptop has a MAC address and I just\nbridged this virtual machine to that\n\n394\n00:21:02.715 --> 00:21:06.220\nsame physical adapter, so\nthey'll have the same MAC address, right?\n\n395\n00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.420\nActually they won't.\n\n396\n00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.292\nMAC addresses are completely spoofable,\n\n397\n00:21:09.292 --> 00:21:11.230\nthey're really not as\nsecure as they used to be.\n\n398\n00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:15.790\nAnd so your virtual machine generates its\nown MAC address to use on that adapter.\n\n399\n00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.980\nAnd so here inside of Windows 7,\nif I do an IP config,\n\n400\n00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:26.611\nI can see that I have an address,\n10.1.230.111, so I'm on that same network.\n\n401\n00:21:26.611 --> 00:21:33.306\nAnd, if I do an IPconfig /all and I look\nat the MAC address on that interface,\n\n402\n00:21:33.306 --> 00:21:37.426\nRight, so here's the Intel PRO/1000 And\n\n403\n00:21:37.426 --> 00:21:42.170\nthe MAC address is 00-0C-29-BA-CC-71.\n\n404\n00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:46.070\nAnd if I go back to my MAC.\n\n405\n00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.301\nLet's get that out of the way.\n\n406\n00:21:47.301 --> 00:21:48.600\nThere we go.\n\n407\n00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.394\nI can see that MAC address is different.\n\n408\n00:21:50.394 --> 00:21:52.280\nSo the MAC addresses don't match.\n\n409\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.450\nThey're two different addresses and\nthat's how you want it.\n\n410\n00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.750\nNow, let's say we set them to be the same.\n\n411\n00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.570\nI just mentioned that MAC\naddresses are spoofable, right.\n\n412\n00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.680\nI could take that virtual machine and\nchange its MAC address.\n\n413\n00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.360\nIn fact,\nlet me see if I can show you guys that.\n\n414\n00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.610\nI don't know if I remember\nexactly where that is.\n\n415\n00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.520\nBut if I go into my Network Adapter,\nand my Network Adapter settings, and\n\n416\n00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.970\nI go into my Settings\nunder Advanced Options.\n\n417\n00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:14.470\nThere we go.\n\n418\n00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.650\nRight here.\n\n419\n00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:17.980\nSee how I can change my MAC address?\n\n420\n00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.250\nWell, not while the machine's booted up.\n\n421\n00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.610\nIf I shut it down I can change it.\n\n422\n00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:24.320\nIf I gave them the same MAC address,\nthere'd be some big problems here, right.\n\n423\n00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.230\nThere'd be big problems with or\nwithout MAC.\n\n424\n00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.960\nBasically any traffic destined for that\nMAC address would go to both my host and\n\n425\n00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.520\nthe VM so\nyou start having a lot of mess there.\n\n426\n00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.770\nSo it's not so much related to MAC in\ngeneral but just duplicate MAC addresses.\n\n427\n00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.160\nYou need to make sure your\nvirtual machines have a unique\n\n428\n00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.000\nMAC address that's not in use.\n\n429\n00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.846\nAnd since they're generating their\nown MAC, you can get duplicates and\n\n430\n00:22:44.846 --> 00:22:45.737\nthat can be a problem.\n\n431\n00:22:45.737 --> 00:22:52.360\nAll right, so, we're able to use these\nport numbers to tell things apart.\n\n432\n00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.130\nBut building off of this idea\nof there being problems,\n\n433\n00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:58.760\nright, you could have two machines\ngenerate the same traffic.\n\n434\n00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.520\nSo, for example, let's say that I've got\na source computer here of 192.168.0.173\n\n435\n00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.730\nthat's going to Google, right, and\nit generates this port number of 50111,\n\n436\n00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:12.150\njust randomly generates it, and\nit's going over here to Google.\n\n437\n00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.710\nLet me flesh this out a little bit.\n\n438\n00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:15.840\nDid I say 50111?\n\n439\n00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.500\nYeah, all right.\n\n440\n00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.841\nAnd put that back on port 53 and\n\n441\n00:23:19.841 --> 00:23:23.584\nwe'll make this a little bit bigger so\nit all fits.\n\n442\n00:23:26.369 --> 00:23:27.391\nThere we go.\n\n443\n00:23:27.391 --> 00:23:30.559\nAll right, so\nthis is my traffic kind of coming in and\n\n444\n00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:34.170\ncoming out from my source out\nto that destination, right.\n\n445\n00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:38.663\nLet's say that I have another host\nthat starts talking, too, right.\n\n446\n00:23:38.663 --> 00:23:42.874\nSo this was 192.168.0.173.\n\n447\n00:23:42.874 --> 00:23:50.815\nMaybe I've got another virtual\nmachine that's 192.168.0.55, right.\n\n448\n00:23:50.815 --> 00:23:54.523\nAnd through whatever cosmic\ncoincidence we have out\n\n449\n00:23:54.523 --> 00:23:58.996\nthere It just randomly generates\n50111 at the same time.\n\n450\n00:23:58.996 --> 00:24:00.400\nOkay, it certainly can happen.\n\n451\n00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.520\nIt's not even that astronomical, right?\n\n452\n00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.578\nIf you think about\nthe dynamic ports it was.\n\n453\n00:24:04.578 --> 00:24:06.436\nWhat was it around, 49,000?\n\n454\n00:24:06.436 --> 00:24:07.039\n>> 152.\n\n455\n00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:11.651\n>> So 49,152 through 65,535.\n\n456\n00:24:11.651 --> 00:24:15.010\nThat's only 15,000 or so ports, right?\n\n457\n00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.290\nSo you got a 1 in 15,000 chance\nof hitting the same one.\n\n458\n00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.190\nThat's better odds than the lottery, and\nsomebody wins that thing every week.\n\n459\n00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.100\nSo it's very possible.\n\n460\n00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.680\nTwo machines could generate\nthe same port number.\n\n461\n00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.190\nAnd if they're going to different\ndestinations, it's no big deal.\n\n462\n00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.560\nWe don't care.\n\n463\n00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.030\nBut if they generate the same port number,\nlike we see here,\n\n464\n00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:36.810\nand they are going to\nthe same destination,\n\n465\n00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:40.980\nthen when they get translated,\nthey look identical don't they?\n\n466\n00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:41.840\nRight?\nThey are getting\n\n467\n00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.100\ntranslated to the same IP.\n\n468\n00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.690\nAnd when Google responds, our system will\nno longer know which one to send it to.\n\n469\n00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:47.870\nNow we got a problem.\n\n470\n00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.770\nAnd there is two solutions to that.\n\n471\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.770\nSolution one Is you don't\ndo dynamic net like this.\n\n472\n00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.340\nInstead, you do whats\ncalled one to one net,\n\n473\n00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.390\nwhere you map one public\nIP to one private IP.\n\n474\n00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.460\nYou don't share, right?\n\n475\n00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:08.500\nSo then this guy might go out as 177,\nbut this guy might go out as 178.\n\n476\n00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.390\nAnd that's what we normally\ndo on the servers.\n\n477\n00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:15.010\nSo if you've got web servers or\nfile servers, Telnet, SSA, whatever it is,\n\n478\n00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.100\nthe thing you're trying to\nprovide out to the Internet.\n\n479\n00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.810\nThat each one will get\ntheir own public IP.\n\n480\n00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.880\nAnd that way you never have to\nworry about ports overlapping and\n\n481\n00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.980\nuser NAT and that's it.\n\n482\n00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.160\nBut if you've got 20 virtual machines, and\n\n483\n00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.730\nthey're all hidden behind a single IP,\nlike what you do with load balancers and\n\n484\n00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.630\nthings of that nature,\nyou're gonna get duplicates.\n\n485\n00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:35.780\nIt's going to be a problem.\n\n486\n00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.930\nAnd you've only got one IP to work with.\n\n487\n00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.880\nAnd so in that scenario,\nwe have to combine NAT\n\n488\n00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.290\nwith a second technology called PAT,\nport address translation.\n\n489\n00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:49.570\nAnd PAT, it's not advanced,\nevery home router does it.\n\n490\n00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.200\nIf you have one of those Linksys,\nor Belkin, NETGEAR,\n\n491\n00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.500\nwhatever those home routers are,\nthey all do PAT in addition to NAT.\n\n492\n00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.180\nAnd what PAT does,\nis it does port address translation.\n\n493\n00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.980\nIt changes the port number also.\n\n494\n00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.170\nSo when we have two people going\nout of the same port number.\n\n495\n00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.960\nWhen your firewall or router or\nvirtualization platform gets it, it will\n\n496\n00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.350\ntranslate that port number, and what it\nwill normally do is just bump it by one.\n\n497\n00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:19.390\nSo this guy might go out as 50112,\ninstead of 50111.\n\n498\n00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:23.660\nAnd now when we get the reply from\nGoogle we know which one goes where.\n\n499\n00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:28.510\nAnd it can translate it back And sent\nback on 50111 to the right destination.\n\n500\n00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.750\nSo it's having to do all this in the\nbackground, it's actually a lot of work.\n\n501\n00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.330\nIt's a lot of work that your\nvirtualization platform is having to do to\n\n502\n00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:38.290\nensure that you don't get duplicates and\nthat you keep things safe.\n\n503\n00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:42.340\nSo on the exam, you'll definitely\nsee them make mention of NAT, but\n\n504\n00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.310\nunderstand that your software\nis not just doing NAT.\n\n505\n00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:47.220\nThat in addition to network\naddress translation,\n\n506\n00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.160\nit's also doing port address translation.\n\n507\n00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.450\nAnd that's a pretty common process.\n\n508\n00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.800\nAnd so make sure you're\nfamiliar with those two terms.\n\n509\n00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.650\nSo let me write them here on this slide.\n\n510\n00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:03.166\nSo we had NAT, which was network\naddress translation, right?\n\n511\n00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:06.149\nAnd, hold on,\nam I not allowed to increase my font size?\n\n512\n00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:08.090\nThere we go.\n\n513\n00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.480\nTry to make it a little bigger so\nwe can all read it.\n\n514\n00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.470\nSo NAT,\nwhich was Network Address Translation, and\n\n515\n00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:20.380\nthen we've got PAT,\nwhich is Port Address Translation.\n\n516\n00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:25.100\nAnd usually, you don't do PAT without NAT,\nso they're typically used together.\n\n517\n00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.490\nPAT is a complement.\n\n518\n00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:29.170\nIt adds on to Network Address Translation\n\n519\n00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.980\nto achieve our goal of being\nable to share these IPs.\n\n520\n00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.630\nBut those two technologies right there,\nyour software is performing them.\n\n521\n00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:41.410\nIf I go back into my VMware Fusion,\nwherever I parked that, here.\n\n522\n00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.360\nIt just says allow virtual machines\non this network to connect\n\n523\n00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.710\nto external networks using NAT.\n\n524\n00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.690\nIt doesn't mention PAT,\nbut it is doing it.\n\n525\n00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.000\nPoor address translation is apart of that.\n\n526\n00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.810\nAll right, the last thing that I\nwant to mention before we wrap up,\n\n527\n00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.640\nbecause I know I'm running low on time,\nare those port numbers.\n\n528\n00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.750\nI mentioned how, somewhere in here,\nI mentioned that.\n\n529\n00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.660\nWhere did I mention that?\n\n530\n00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.170\nSomewhere, here.\n\n531\n00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.760\nThat we had 1 through 1,024\nare well-known port numbers.\n\n532\n00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.090\nAnd most of our stuff is gonna be there.\n\n533\n00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:10.640\nThere's just a handful of port\nnumbers that CompTIA wants\n\n534\n00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.550\nyou to memorize for the exam.\n\n535\n00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:13.880\nThey're really common ones.\n\n536\n00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.530\nSo I've got those kinda\nwhipped up in a diagram here.\n\n537\n00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.400\nLet's take a look at this.\n\n538\n00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.520\nSo these are some common protocols.\n\n539\n00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.060\nAnd these are the ones that\nCompTIA wants you to know\n\n540\n00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.670\nprior to going into that\nexam booth to take the exam.\n\n541\n00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.270\nFile Transfer Protocol, FTP.\n\n542\n00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:31.870\nThat's what we used to use to\ntransfer files back in the day.\n\n543\n00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:32.980\nIt's a UNIX protocol.\n\n544\n00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.790\nIt's still in use today.\n\n545\n00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.390\nWe use it here for\nmoving video files all the time.\n\n546\n00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.990\nFile Transfer Protocol uses ports 20 and\n21.\n\n547\n00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:41.070\n21 is the primary port.\n\n548\n00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.240\nThat's what it connects on,\nbut it uses 20 also.\n\n549\n00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:48.590\nSSH, secure shell, that's a encrypted\nshell connection between you and\n\n550\n00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.568\nanother system, it uses port 22.\n\n551\n00:28:50.568 --> 00:28:53.600\nThat's important,\ncuz if you're bringing up Linux boxes,\n\n552\n00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.740\nyou might need to SSH into your\nvirtual machine to control it, and so\n\n553\n00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.100\nyou'll need to make sure that's allowed\nthrough firewalls or other services.\n\n554\n00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.570\nNow, SSH isn't the only\nthing that uses port 22.\n\n555\n00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:07.930\nYou can actually take a lot of other\nprotocols and then embed them in SSH.\n\n556\n00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.370\nSo like secure file transfer protocol,\n\n557\n00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:12.850\nSFTP, if you want to do\nthat goes over port 22.\n\n558\n00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:16.910\nAll that is is FTP over an SSH tunnel.\n\n559\n00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.620\nSimple Mail Transport Protocol,\nSMTP, uses port 25.\n\n560\n00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:26.360\nSo anytime you send an email and\nmoves from server to server it's port 25.\n\n561\n00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.590\nDNS, DNS uses port 53.\n\n562\n00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:33.280\nAnd it's a little bit different than the\nother protocols, cuz it uses TCP and UDP.\n\n563\n00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.440\nIf you're not familiar with the transport\nprotocols, you can jump over and\n\n564\n00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.850\ncheck out our Network Plus show,\nwe go in depth on it there.\n\n565\n00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:44.220\nBut what it just means is that\nDNS can run as a stateful,\n\n566\n00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.070\nreliable connection, or\na best effort connection,\n\n567\n00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:50.850\nwhich is designed for networks\nwhere latency is usually a concern.\n\n568\n00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.320\nSo it runs on port 53.\n\n569\n00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.100\nYou got DHCP, Dynamic Host Configuration\nProtocol, it runs on port 68.\n\n570\n00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.280\nWhen you're exchanging those\nrequests to get an address,\n\n571\n00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.290\nwe've gotta make sure those\nare allowed trough our network.\n\n572\n00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:07.670\nHTTP, which is web access, runs on\nport 80, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.\n\n573\n00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.850\nThat's how we browse the web,\n\n574\n00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:13.500\na web server's gonna use port 80, and\nport 443 is the name thing but secure.\n\n575\n00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.330\nHTTP over SSL,\nwe use secure communications.\n\n576\n00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:21.010\nAnd when I pulled up my\nterminal connection earlier and\n\n577\n00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:25.050\nwas looking at all my various\nconnections to ITProTV,\n\n578\n00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:29.250\nyou'll see where all those went out,\non port 443.\n\n579\n00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.419\nThat was me doing a secure web\nconnection to our website.\n\n580\n00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.030\nRight there you see the connection and\nyou're in business.\n\n581\n00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.870\nSo by knowing those port numbers I\nwas able to identify that web traffic\n\n582\n00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:42.230\nvery quickly, and\nthat's why it's important to know these.\n\n583\n00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.295\nIt's really helpful for\ntroubleshooting and other things too.\n\n584\n00:30:45.295 --> 00:30:46.345\nIt's not such a bad list.\n\n585\n00:30:46.345 --> 00:30:49.115\nI know in the Network Plus show I\nhave like two screens of this stuff.\n\n586\n00:30:49.115 --> 00:30:51.175\nIn the Linux Plus show I have\ntwo screens of this stuff.\n\n587\n00:30:51.175 --> 00:30:53.475\nBut here we just have to know these seven.\n\n588\n00:30:53.475 --> 00:30:54.725\nIt's not so bad.\n\n589\n00:30:54.725 --> 00:30:57.325\nBut definitely have these memorized before\ngoing into the exam cuz you'll need to\n\n590\n00:30:57.325 --> 00:30:58.805\nknow them.\n\n591\n00:30:58.805 --> 00:30:59.365\n>> All right, Don.\nWell,\n\n592\n00:30:59.365 --> 00:31:02.375\nthat's a good review of network\naddress translation as well as some of\n\n593\n00:31:02.375 --> 00:31:06.190\nthe port numbers that are very common for\nall of to have to get used to.\n\n594\n00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.280\nAnd remember that going over these network\nconcepts are actually key if you want\n\n595\n00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:15.550\nto make sure that you get where\nyou need to get on your Cloud Plus\n\n596\n00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.920\ncertification as well.\n\n597\n00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.920\nDon, any other last minute hints\nas they get ready for the exam?\n\n598\n00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.900\n>> That's really it.\n\n599\n00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.100\nRemember, it's not a networking exam, but\nthese are basic concepts they expect you\n\n600\n00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.440\nto already know, so\nthat's why it's important to cover them.\n\n601\n00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.830\nIf this went way over your head,\n\n602\n00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:31.290\nif it didn't make sense,\ndefinitely jump over to Network Plus.\n\n603\n00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:33.490\nGreat content over there,\nwe go in-depth on it.\n\n604\n00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.820\nBut if none of this was new to you,\nthen you're well-prepared.\n\n605\n00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.630\nYou got everything you need to know for\nnetworking.\n\n606\n00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.560\nLet's move on to the other technologies\nand get to see it working.\n\n607\n00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.400\nBut those are just some basic concepts\nthat we need to make sure we've got\n\n608\n00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.660\nunder our belt.\n\n609\n00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.280\n>> All right, Don.\n\n610\n00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.310\nThank you again for that great review.\n\n611\n00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.550\nThank you for also joining us too.\n\n612\n00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.160\nSigning off for IT ProTV.\n\n613\n00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.748\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n614\n00:31:53.748 --> 00:31:55.436\n>> And I'm Don Pizet.\n\n615\n00:31:55.436 --> 00:31:57.955\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:16.380\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.900\nin today's episode we're gonna\nbe moving along in Cloud+.\n\n5\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.230\nAnd who do we have with us today?\n\n6\n00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.650\nNone other than Mr. Don Pezet to help\nus get our head out of the clouds, or\n\n7\n00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.290\nin this case, maybe in the clouds.\n\n8\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.320\nHow we doing today, Don?\n\n9\n00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.260\nI am doing great, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.120\nThanks for having me on the show and\nready to dive into the world of advanced\n\n11\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.200\nnetworking inside of\na virtualization cloud.\n\n12\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.830\nAnd remember when we talk about\nthat cloud we're talking about\n\n13\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.710\nhosted solutions out there on\nthe Internet as well as private,\n\n14\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.450\ninternal clouds that we've built\nup with our own infrastructure.\n\n15\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.118\nAnd all of them have certain things that\nwe can tweak with networking to improve\n\n16\n00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:49.741\nperformance, get things\nrunning as best as possible.\n\n17\n00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:53.520\nWe're gonna take a look at some of those\nbells and whistles right in this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.310\nAll right well, what we're gonna do is,\n\n19\n00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.888\nwe're gonna kick off talking about\nvirtual local area networks, or VLANs.\n\n20\n00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:01.170\nI know I've mentioned them\nbriefly in a few other episodes,\n\n21\n00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.650\nI think three different episodes\nwe've mentioned them briefly.\n\n22\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.180\nIn this episode we're gonna actually see\nhow they work and how we can use them.\n\n23\n00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.142\nAnd one of the big challenges that we have\nwhen we're doing virtualization is you\n\n24\n00:01:11.142 --> 00:01:12.957\nhave to have a virtualization host.\n\n25\n00:01:12.957 --> 00:01:17.120\nAnd that host might be VMware ESX,\nit might be Citrix Xenserver or whatever.\n\n26\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.976\nAnd that host, it's a piece of\nhardware and it can only have so\n\n27\n00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:23.220\nmany network adapters in it.\n\n28\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.675\nSo if I have, let's say I've got 15\nvirtual machines running on that host.\n\n29\n00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:31.000\nI got tons of memory, tons of CPU,\nI've got 15 VM's running.\n\n30\n00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.010\nAm I gonna have 15 network cards for\nthose VM's?\n\n31\n00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.590\nPretty doubtful, right?\n\n32\n00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.730\nAlmost every server today comes\nwith two network adapters.\n\n33\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.534\nAnd the intention of those two network\nadapters is that you use one for\n\n34\n00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.210\nmanagement and you use the other for\nactual data flow.\n\n35\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.380\nBut if I have 15 VMs, I don't want\nthem all on one network adapter, do I?\n\n36\n00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.670\nWell, maybe, if it's only a 10 gig\nadapter, if you got tons of bandwidth, or\n\n37\n00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.960\nmaybe it's a low bandwidth application,\n\n38\n00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.380\nlike an Active Directory\ndomain controller.\n\n39\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.080\nDomain controllers don't need a ton of\nbandwidth, they just need to be up and\n\n40\n00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.200\navailable, right?\n\n41\n00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.544\nSo we can have 15 machines sharing\na single adapter if we want.\n\n42\n00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:08.069\nBut the odds are we're gonna want\nsome kind of isolation between those\n\n43\n00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.750\nvirtual machines.\n\n44\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.155\nThat one VM might not be something we\nwant sitting right next to another VM.\n\n45\n00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:18.340\nA great example would be,\nlet's say that we had a DMZ, right.\n\n46\n00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.000\nI've got a web server that I want\nto be publicly internet facing.\n\n47\n00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.630\nI want everybody else in\nthe Internet to see this web server.\n\n48\n00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.270\nBut then I've got an Active Directory\ndomain controller\n\n49\n00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.170\nthat I don't want everybody to see.\n\n50\n00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.550\nI want that to be internal only, right.\n\n51\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.420\nSo I have my LAN resources and my DMZ\nresources and I wanna isolate those out.\n\n52\n00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.985\nWell in the past, you had to get\nseparate physical network adapters.\n\n53\n00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:39.505\nAnd you'd say, all right,\n\n54\n00:02:39.505 --> 00:02:42.525\nwell this physical adapter is\ngonna be tied to the LAN, and\n\n55\n00:02:42.525 --> 00:02:46.335\nthis other physical adapter is gonna\nbe type to the WAN, or DMZ or whatever.\n\n56\n00:02:46.335 --> 00:02:48.865\nAnd so you'd have to have\nmultiple network adapters.\n\n57\n00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:50.305\nBut eventually you run out of slots,\n\n58\n00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:52.755\nyou can only get fit many\nadapters in that server.\n\n59\n00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:53.605\nAnd so what we can do is,\n\n60\n00:02:53.605 --> 00:02:58.030\ninstead of doing physical adapters,\nwe can do virtual local area networks.\n\n61\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.550\nWe can divide that one connector\nup into several smaller networks.\n\n62\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.410\nAnd there's a number of big benefits for\ndoing that, but\n\n63\n00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.920\nbasically it's gonna divide that up and\nallow us to share that resource.\n\n64\n00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.514\n>> Don, one of the questions I have,\nthey call out on Cloud+,\n\n65\n00:03:12.514 --> 00:03:17.440\nthey talk about things like multitenancy\nand network segregation, right?\n\n66\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.585\nAnd if I do have multiple tenants\nfrom a cloud provider's perspective,\n\n67\n00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:24.380\nand we need to enforce things\nlike data security standards,\n\n68\n00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.810\nis this the way that they can do that?\n\n69\n00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.575\nHow they can segregate those networks\nfrom one another inside of the cloud?\n\n70\n00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:32.420\n>> It certainly is, I mean, with VLANs\nwhat you're doing is you're taking\n\n71\n00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.600\na physical switch, and you're dividing\nthe physical switch up into multiple\n\n72\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.480\nvirtual switches, logical switches.\n\n73\n00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.990\nAnd if somebody's plugged into one\nof those virtual switches they\n\n74\n00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.200\nonly see the other devices\non that virtual switch.\n\n75\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.723\nSo if we were hosting VMs for more than\none company, you could do this and\n\n76\n00:03:47.723 --> 00:03:50.550\nisolate them out and\nthey wouldn't see each other.\n\n77\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.870\nRight, now if you're ultra super\ntop secret security, you might opt\n\n78\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.050\nto do separate physical switches,\ncompletely separate infrastructures.\n\n79\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.950\nBecause there are certain\nattacks that people can wage\n\n80\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.410\nto do what's called VLAN hopping, right,\nto try and jump from one VLAN to another.\n\n81\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.984\nSame thing with virtual machines, in\ntheory every virtual machine is isolated,\n\n82\n00:04:07.984 --> 00:04:09.609\nthey're separate from each other.\n\n83\n00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.944\nBut there's certain memory\nattacks that they can try and\n\n84\n00:04:11.944 --> 00:04:14.627\nperform against the host OS to try and\nread memory from other VMs.\n\n85\n00:04:14.627 --> 00:04:18.851\nMost of those don't, they're patched,\nthey don't happen anymore, but\n\n86\n00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:20.180\nit is a potential risk.\n\n87\n00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.293\nAnd so\nsome people don't like to use VLANs.\n\n88\n00:04:22.293 --> 00:04:26.380\nBut for most people, and by most I\nmean 99% of the people out there,\n\n89\n00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.200\nVLANs are a perfect solution.\n\n90\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.700\nThey give you a very high degree of\nsecurity and let you dice up that network,\n\n91\n00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.940\nget a chance kinda see what that does.\n\n92\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.410\nNow understand that when we create VLANs,\nthese are separate, isolated networks.\n\n93\n00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.350\nAnd by default,\nthe VLANs cannot see each other,\n\n94\n00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.490\nthey are completely partitioned off,\nthey're completely separate.\n\n95\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.677\nSo if I create virtual machines and place\nthem in one VLAN and I take other virtual\n\n96\n00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:51.735\nmachines and place them with a different\nVLAN, they cannot see each other.\n\n97\n00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:55.830\nSo I'm still going to need some sort\nof routing infrastructure to be able to\n\n98\n00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.108\ncommunicate traffic between the VLANs.\n\n99\n00:04:58.108 --> 00:05:01.220\nAnd on the exam objectives they call\nout routing and routing tables.\n\n100\n00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.210\nRight, because each VLAN is\ngonna have its own IP subnet.\n\n101\n00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.775\nAnd so when you have a router, its routing\ntable has got to be updated to contain all\n\n102\n00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:12.760\nthe networks that you've created for\nthese VLANs, right, that's important.\n\n103\n00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.390\nAnd so we've gotta designate that,\n\n104\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.760\nwe've gotta create those resources and\nflag them and have it available.\n\n105\n00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.380\nNow you're router,\nit might be a physical router.\n\n106\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.728\nYou might have a Cisco router, or Juniper,\nor somebody like that that's plugged into\n\n107\n00:05:23.728 --> 00:05:26.067\nthese VLANs and\nis able to route between them.\n\n108\n00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:28.555\nOr you might have a software router.\n\n109\n00:05:28.555 --> 00:05:29.965\nPlenty of virtualization\nplatforms have it,\n\n110\n00:05:29.965 --> 00:05:31.575\nI know I've shown that in other episodes.\n\n111\n00:05:31.575 --> 00:05:35.955\nBut there's also things like the pfSense\nfirewall that you can run in a virtual\n\n112\n00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:38.045\nmachine and it can route between\nall the different VLANs.\n\n113\n00:05:38.045 --> 00:05:41.337\nYou can really get kinda powerful with\nthis stuff, it's pretty neat, so.\n\n114\n00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:43.217\nAll right well,\nI've kinda been talking about it here, but\n\n115\n00:05:43.217 --> 00:05:44.877\nlet me show how this works.\n\n116\n00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:48.657\nAnd I'm gonna start,\nlet me jump over to a physical switch.\n\n117\n00:05:48.657 --> 00:05:53.599\nSo here I am on a physical switch and\nbasically what I wanna do is, well first,\n\n118\n00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.412\nlet me make this a little bit bigger so\nI can see everything.\n\n119\n00:05:57.412 --> 00:06:01.410\nAnd [LAUGH] I guess that's\nabout as big as it's gonna get.\n\n120\n00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.158\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n121\n00:06:02.158 --> 00:06:05.260\nwhat I wanna do I just wanna show\non this switch how VLANs work.\n\n122\n00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.180\nNow, when you buy a brand new switch, when\nyou crack open a package and take that\n\n123\n00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.550\nbrand new switch and plug it in, your\nswitch has a bunch of interfaces, right?\n\n124\n00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.159\nSo this switch that I've\ngot here is 24 ports?\n\n125\n00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.943\n48 ports?\n\n126\n00:06:18.943 --> 00:06:20.355\nIt's a 48 port switch.\n\n127\n00:06:20.355 --> 00:06:23.127\nSo here I'm seeing all 48 ports, and\n\n128\n00:06:23.127 --> 00:06:28.020\non a 48 port switch like this,\nevery port is in the same VLAN.\n\n129\n00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.540\nSo if I plug a computer into port 1 and\nI plug a computer into port 48,\n\n130\n00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.530\nthey're gonna see each other.\n\n131\n00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.470\nIt's all the same VLAN.\n\n132\n00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:42.000\nAnd if I do a show VLAN here, I can see\nhow all those ports are listed right here.\n\n133\n00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.788\nPorts 1 through 48, and\nthe gig uplinks too,\n\n134\n00:06:44.788 --> 00:06:47.237\nthey're all right here in VLAN number 1.\n\n135\n00:06:47.237 --> 00:06:51.262\nVLAN number 1 is typically the default,\nthat's not a guarantee.\n\n136\n00:06:51.262 --> 00:06:54.330\nRight, dfferent vendors can do different\nthings, but it is pretty common for\n\n137\n00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.440\nthat to be the default.\n\n138\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.420\nNow, what I can do from here is I\ncan start to divide the switch up.\n\n139\n00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.430\nNow how you do that is gonna\nvary based on the vendor.\n\n140\n00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.500\nI'm on a Cisco switch here,\nit's the most common, and\n\n141\n00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.790\nif CompTIA shows you any examples\nthey almost always show Cisco.\n\n142\n00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.060\nBut you could have Juniper switches or\nHP Procurves or, God forbid, Dell Power,\n\n143\n00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.806\nwhat are the Dell, PowerConnect or\nwhatever, it's terrible, it's-\n\n144\n00:07:17.806 --> 00:07:18.631\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n145\n00:07:18.631 --> 00:07:19.974\n>> So you can have great switches,\n\n146\n00:07:19.974 --> 00:07:22.850\nyou can have bad switches,\na lot of them support VLANs though.\n\n147\n00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.510\nAnd they might have a graphical\nuser interface for assigning this.\n\n148\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.890\nBut on Cisco we just use\na command line like this.\n\n149\n00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.500\nAnd what I can do is I can\njump into my configuration and\n\n150\n00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.440\nI can start to create VLANs.\n\n151\n00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.380\nSo let's run with a typical example.\n\n152\n00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.600\nLet's say that my company\nis gonna have three VLANs.\n\n153\n00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.488\nI'm gonna create them, I'm just\ngonna call them VLAN 10, 20, and 30.\n\n154\n00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:44.693\nSo I'm gonna say vlan 10, and\nI'm gonna give it a name.\n\n155\n00:07:44.693 --> 00:07:47.157\nAnd vlan 10,\nI'm gonna make that my intranet, okay.\n\n156\n00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.940\nNow an intranet, that's usually\nlike our local area network.\n\n157\n00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.121\nThese are servers and\n\n158\n00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:56.934\nresources that I want to be available\nto people inside of my company.\n\n159\n00:07:56.934 --> 00:08:00.871\nI don't want people on the Internet having\naccess to this, this is my internal stuff.\n\n160\n00:08:00.871 --> 00:08:01.543\nIntra, right?\n\n161\n00:08:01.543 --> 00:08:03.109\nInside my network.\n\n162\n00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:09.398\nI'll create a vlan 20, and\nI'll make this one my extranet.\n\n163\n00:08:09.398 --> 00:08:12.387\nOkay, extranet,\nthese are sources that I'm making, or\n\n164\n00:08:12.387 --> 00:08:16.550\nresources that I'm making available\noutside of my organization, right.\n\n165\n00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.860\nSo this might be like my web server,\nmy DMZ.\n\n166\n00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.490\nOr there might be other companies out\nthere that I'm partnered with, and\n\n167\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.590\nthese are the resources that\nI expose to them, right?\n\n168\n00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.200\nIntranet, that's internal only.\n\n169\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.970\nExtranet, we're sharing\nwith outside people.\n\n170\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.610\nAnd then lastly,\nI'll make one for vlan 30,\n\n171\n00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.980\nwhich I'm just gonna call internet,\nall right?\n\n172\n00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.238\nInternet is very similar to extranet,\nright.\n\n173\n00:08:40.238 --> 00:08:42.320\nExtranet resource I'm making\navailable externally.\n\n174\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.590\nBut an extranet might be over private\nlinks, private links just between me and\n\n175\n00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.590\nanother partner.\n\n176\n00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.500\nThe Internet is specifically the Internet.\n\n177\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.770\nAnd if I have a web server\nthat's publicly available,\n\n178\n00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.800\nit's normally going to be on the Internet.\n\n179\n00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.820\nAnd so this could be a DMZ also.\n\n180\n00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.680\nSome people use extranet\na few different ways, but\n\n181\n00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.830\nInternet always means this is connected to\nthe Internet, it's a public connection.\n\n182\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.700\nYou'll hear people refer to this\nas a wide area network or a WAN.\n\n183\n00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.960\nBe careful with that terminology because\njust because it's a WAN doesn't mean it's\n\n184\n00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.330\nconnected to the Internet.\n\n185\n00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.540\nYou can have private WAN links between\nbranch office buildings in your\n\n186\n00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.020\nheadquarters, they're not on the Internet,\nright?\n\n187\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.707\nSo there is a difference there, and\nCompTIA uses this terminology right here,\n\n188\n00:09:18.707 --> 00:09:20.533\nintranet, extranet, and Internet.\n\n189\n00:09:20.533 --> 00:09:21.718\nYou definitely wanna be\nfamiliar with those.\n\n190\n00:09:21.718 --> 00:09:25.411\n>> Now, one of the things I'm thinking,\nDon, here is, when you had all those\n\n191\n00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:29.163\nports, and the switch is looking at all\nthese ports and its got its MAC table,\n\n192\n00:09:29.163 --> 00:09:33.069\nnow it's just gathering the MAC addresses\nand figuring out the destinations.\n\n193\n00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:34.940\nBut it's not that way anymore.\n\n194\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.040\nIt seems like you've kinda\nvirtually sliced and diced it now.\n\n195\n00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.120\nHow does it identify I wanna send\ninformation only to the intranet.\n\n196\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.440\nI wanna send information to the extranet,\nor maybe I just wanna send information in\n\n197\n00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.930\nand through the Internet\nvlan that you just created.\n\n198\n00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:49.960\nHow's it identified?\n\n199\n00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.060\n>> Well,\nnormally we do it by port assignments.\n\n200\n00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.370\nSo if I go back to my show vlan output,\nright, and we start to look at it,\n\n201\n00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.060\nremember how I brought this up earlier.\n\n202\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.670\nAnd all the ports were in VLAN 1.\n\n203\n00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.461\nWell, they still are.\n\n204\n00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:03.120\nThey're all still in VLAN 1.\n\n205\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.290\nAnd here's my nice,\nshiny, new VLANs I made,\n\n206\n00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.930\n10, 20, 30, and\nthey've got no ports assigned to them.\n\n207\n00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.880\nSo normally what you do, is you come\nin and you start assigning ports.\n\n208\n00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:17.870\nAnd so I might say,\ninterface range fa0/1- 8.\n\n209\n00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.560\nLet's just do 1- 4, I'll be lazy.\n\n210\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.427\nAnd we put those onto a vlan.\n\n211\n00:10:23.427 --> 00:10:26.969\nAnd so\nI'm going to stick these guys on vlan 10.\n\n212\n00:10:26.969 --> 00:10:32.639\nAnd then I might go port 5- 8,\n\n213\n00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:37.270\nand put them on vlan 20.\n\n214\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:42.420\nAnd then, maybe we'll do 9- 12,\nand put them on vlan 30, right?\n\n215\n00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:49.491\nSo, once that's done, if I do a show vlan,\ndo show vlan, there we go.\n\n216\n00:10:49.491 --> 00:10:53.073\nI can come in, and\nI can see now vlan 10, 20, and 30,\n\n217\n00:10:53.073 --> 00:10:56.210\nthey've got ports assigned to them right?\n\n218\n00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.852\nAnybody I plug into ports 1\nthrough 4 will be on vlan 10, and\n\n219\n00:10:59.852 --> 00:11:03.350\nthey'll be able to see each other and\ncommunicate.\n\n220\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:08.370\nAnd anybody I plug into port 5 through\n8 will be able to see each other.\n\n221\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.480\nThey're on my extranet.\n\n222\n00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.310\nAnd anybody that I plug into 9 through 12,\nthey'll be able to see each other.\n\n223\n00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.540\nThey'll be on my Internet.\n\n224\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:21.060\nBut somebody on port 1 won't\nbe able to see port 5,\n\n225\n00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.230\nand somebody on port 5 won't\nbe able to see port 9.\n\n226\n00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.059\nThey're isolated between the vlans.\n\n227\n00:11:26.059 --> 00:11:28.985\nSo I've done this with physical ports,\nright.\n\n228\n00:11:28.985 --> 00:11:30.185\nBut what does this mean?\n\n229\n00:11:30.185 --> 00:11:33.605\nThis means that if I have a virtual\nmachine host, right, I've got a VM host.\n\n230\n00:11:33.605 --> 00:11:36.295\nAnd if I wanna have guest VMs that\nare on all three of these networks,\n\n231\n00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:40.345\nI'm gonna need three network adapters\nin each server, really four, right.\n\n232\n00:11:40.345 --> 00:11:44.905\nOne for management, one for intranet,\none for Internet, one for extranet, so I'm\n\n233\n00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:49.700\ngonna have four network adapters in all of\nmy servers, right, in all of my VM hosts.\n\n234\n00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.420\nAnd that way when I take\na virtual machine and\n\n235\n00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.610\nput it on there I can pick\nbetween these networks.\n\n236\n00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.044\nAnd if I have failover, I need that\nVM to jump over to another host.\n\n237\n00:11:57.044 --> 00:12:00.140\nIt'll have all four adapters so it can\npick the one that needs and it can go off.\n\n238\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.840\nThat works great,\nexcept it took me four adapters to do it.\n\n239\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.790\nAnd some of these networks might\nbe really busy, some might not.\n\n240\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.060\nI might not even be using some\nof these on a particular host.\n\n241\n00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:15.575\nI might have a particular VM host\nthat only has intranet VMs on it.\n\n242\n00:12:15.575 --> 00:12:18.210\nAnd so\nnow I'm wasting those other two adapters.\n\n243\n00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.209\nWouldn't it be nice if I could use\nthe bandwidth of those adapters and\n\n244\n00:12:21.209 --> 00:12:23.340\nkind of roll that all together and\nmake use of it?\n\n245\n00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.769\nAnd, you can.\n\n246\n00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:29.370\nRight, we can do that through\nthe use of what are called trunks.\n\n247\n00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.460\nAnd a trunk is where you take one\nphysical port and instead of just sending\n\n248\n00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:39.330\na single vlan on it like I'm doing here,\nright, Fa0/1 is just carrying intranet.\n\n249\n00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:44.310\nI could say that Fa0/1 is gonna carry\nintranet, Internet, and extranet.\n\n250\n00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:48.720\nIt's gonna carry all three of\nthose vlans across that one link.\n\n251\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.100\nAnd now all my physical servers would just\nneed two adaptors, one for management and\n\n252\n00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:58.090\none for this trunk connection\nthat carries all three networks.\n\n253\n00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.356\nAnd now my VMs can jump from network\nto network on what their need is when I\n\n254\n00:13:01.356 --> 00:13:03.432\ncreate them and\nget them kind of put in place.\n\n255\n00:13:03.432 --> 00:13:06.765\n>> Now one of the things I'm thinking Don,\nhere is coming from the A+,\n\n256\n00:13:06.765 --> 00:13:10.676\nthe Network+ background is that any time,\nit seems like you're putting a lot of\n\n257\n00:13:10.676 --> 00:13:14.907\nemphasis on a single port, right, a lot of\ninformation that's going through there.\n\n258\n00:13:14.907 --> 00:13:18.637\nAnd it almost seems like that one port\nif it's not configured correctly,\n\n259\n00:13:18.637 --> 00:13:21.764\ncould be a bottleneck for\nthe entire system as all machines and\n\n260\n00:13:21.764 --> 00:13:25.390\ntraffic are kinda like combined,\nthey're using it together.\n\n261\n00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.990\nIs that a situation that\nwe have to worry about?\n\n262\n00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.571\n>> Yeah, and what I normally hear is,\n\n263\n00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:31.754\nthis is usually the part where people\nstop believing what I'm saying.\n\n264\n00:13:31.754 --> 00:13:34.041\n[LAUGH] And they're like, hey Don,\nthis is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.\n\n265\n00:13:34.041 --> 00:13:36.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Why isolate the network?\n\n266\n00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.268\nWhy create these divisions in the network\nif we're just gonna put them all back\n\n267\n00:13:39.268 --> 00:13:40.342\ntogether again on the same link?\n\n268\n00:13:40.342 --> 00:13:43.030\nIsn't that defeating the whole purpose?\n\n269\n00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.813\nWell, it isn't.\n\n270\n00:13:44.813 --> 00:13:48.645\nAnd the reason it isn't is that your\nswitches have technologies built into them\n\n271\n00:13:48.645 --> 00:13:51.162\nso that when the traffic\ngoes over that single link,\n\n272\n00:13:51.162 --> 00:13:54.390\nit can identify what network\nit's supposed to be on.\n\n273\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.410\nAnd guess what?\n\n274\n00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.670\nYour virtual machine hosts have it, too.\n\n275\n00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:02.670\nIf you're running Citrix Zen server or\nMicrosoft's Hyper-V, VMWare's ESX,\n\n276\n00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.930\nif you're running any of\nthose hardware platforms,\n\n277\n00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:10.512\neven KVM in the open source platforms,\nall of them support VLAN trunking.\n\n278\n00:14:10.512 --> 00:14:14.006\nSo that they know when that traffic comes\nacross that it's in the right VLAN,\n\n279\n00:14:14.006 --> 00:14:15.422\nthat's in the right network.\n\n280\n00:14:15.422 --> 00:14:17.840\nThey were able to segregate that out,\nall right.\n\n281\n00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.927\nLet me show you kinda how\nthat works real quick.\n\n282\n00:14:19.927 --> 00:14:23.865\nIf I take a port, and\nlet's just say I pick a port at random.\n\n283\n00:14:23.865 --> 00:14:24.725\nWho haven't I used?\n\n284\n00:14:24.725 --> 00:14:26.345\nWe'll do lucky number 13.\n\n285\n00:14:26.345 --> 00:14:29.305\nSo I've got ports 1 through 12\nstatically assigned to certain VLANs.\n\n286\n00:14:29.305 --> 00:14:34.718\nI'm going to take interface 13, so\nlet me just jump into that one.\n\n287\n00:14:34.718 --> 00:14:39.486\nAll right, and a normal port is what's\ncalled a traditional switchboard or\n\n288\n00:14:39.486 --> 00:14:43.930\nan access port, that you would\nnormally plug a client into.\n\n289\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:48.810\nBut on this one, I could say something\nlike switchport mode trunk, and\n\n290\n00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.430\nforce it to be a trunk.\n\n291\n00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.521\nWell, it just rejected me, all right.\n\n292\n00:14:52.521 --> 00:14:53.577\nWhy?\nMaybe it doesn't like me.\n\n293\n00:14:53.577 --> 00:14:57.148\nBut the reason it's rejecting me here\nis that when we go to be a trunk,\n\n294\n00:14:57.148 --> 00:15:01.214\nwe're gonna communicate across that\nline in a certain language, that says,\n\n295\n00:15:01.214 --> 00:15:04.940\nthis traffic belongs to this VLAN,\nthat traffic belongs to that VLAN.\n\n296\n00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.440\nAnd whoever's on the other side has\nto speak the same language as us.\n\n297\n00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.530\nBecause if they don't speak the same\nlanguage, they're not going to know.\n\n298\n00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.040\nAnd all of this traffic is going to\nget merged back onto one VLAN, and\n\n299\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.120\nwe've completely lost the point.\n\n300\n00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.803\n>> Do we have some kind of,\nI don't know, traffic control system?\n\n301\n00:15:19.803 --> 00:15:23.205\nDo we have I'm thinking customs\nstamping every packet as it, or\n\n302\n00:15:23.205 --> 00:15:25.490\nframe as it passes through that switch?\n\n303\n00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.520\n>> Yeah,\nthere's two big technologies that do this.\n\n304\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.770\nOne is Cisco's ISL, which is proprietary,\nso you don't see that very much.\n\n305\n00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:36.488\nBut the big one, the one that\nis used pretty much everywhere,\n\n306\n00:15:36.488 --> 00:15:38.867\nis 802.1Q VLAN tagging.\n\n307\n00:15:38.867 --> 00:15:42.420\nAll right, that's the IEEE standard for\nit, 802.1Q VLAN tagging.\n\n308\n00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:46.505\nAnd what that tagging means is every\nframe that passes over this link,\n\n309\n00:15:46.505 --> 00:15:49.910\nit's gonna take the VLAN number,\nand it's gonna tag it.\n\n310\n00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.780\nIt's gonna stick it in, think of like the\nwildlife conservationists where they track\n\n311\n00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.217\nthe lions out on the Serengeti.\n\n312\n00:15:55.217 --> 00:15:56.494\nThey put the little ear tag on them.\n\n313\n00:15:56.494 --> 00:15:57.642\nThat's exactly what this is.\n\n314\n00:15:57.642 --> 00:15:59.175\nWe're gonna tag those frames.\n\n315\n00:15:59.175 --> 00:16:00.614\nAnd send them over the line.\n\n316\n00:16:00.614 --> 00:16:04.690\nAnd who's ever on the other side, can just\nlook at that tag and say you're on VLAN10,\n\n317\n00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.950\nyou're on VLAN20, you're on VLAN30 and\nput you in the right place.\n\n318\n00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.970\nSo, they're gonna do that in\nthe background and take care of it.\n\n319\n00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:15.110\nBut that language is identifying\nhow that tag is gonna work.\n\n320\n00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.592\nSo, what I need to do is say switch\nport trunk encapsulation, and\n\n321\n00:16:19.592 --> 00:16:24.250\nthen I can specify the time, and\nI'm going to set this one to .1q.\n\n322\n00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:28.525\nThat's really important because if you're\nrunning something like Citrix end server,\n\n323\n00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:30.070\nit only supports 802.1q.\n\n324\n00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.270\nIt doesn't support ISO.\n\n325\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.950\nIn fact, I don't know any of them that\ndo because ISO is really just kind of\n\n326\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:34.610\nCisco's thing.\n\n327\n00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.470\nSo we really want to\nhard set that to 802.1q.\n\n328\n00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.993\nAnd once that happens,\nthen we can say switchport mode trunk and\n\n329\n00:16:41.993 --> 00:16:44.690\nnow this interface is going to trunk.\n\n330\n00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:51.240\nIf I do a show interface trunk and,\nshoot, my interface isn't up.\n\n331\n00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.900\nI actually don't have anything\nplugged in to that port, so\n\n332\n00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.960\nit's not gonna come active.\n\n333\n00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.019\nBut if I plug something into that port,\nit's gonna come active, and\n\n334\n00:16:57.019 --> 00:16:59.712\nit'll start carrying that VLAN\ninformation across it, and\n\n335\n00:16:59.712 --> 00:17:02.430\nnow, we'll be able to communicate\nacross all these VLANs.\n\n336\n00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:07.017\nNow, one quick word of caution, if you're\nconfiguring your switch to do this,\n\n337\n00:17:07.017 --> 00:17:09.790\nby default,\nwhen you flag it as a trunk, right.\n\n338\n00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.070\nSo if we look at my config,\nI am flagged as a trunk.\n\n339\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:16.230\nWhen you do that, you're now carrying.\n\n340\n00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.650\nWhy do I keep doing that?\n\n341\n00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:22.470\nYou're now carrying every single\nVLAN across your network, right?\n\n342\n00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:27.690\nI created intranet, internet, extranet,\nbut I might have some other ones, right?\n\n343\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:33.590\nWe might have, for example I might do,\nw ell there's VLAN1, the default VLAN.\n\n344\n00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.845\nI might create a VLAN40 for research and\n\n345\n00:17:36.845 --> 00:17:41.130\ndevelopment, right, or\nthe dev team, or whatever.\n\n346\n00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:48.190\nI might have a VLAN50 for,\nI don't know, out of band management.\n\n347\n00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.292\nWhatever it is that you want, you might\nhave more VLAN's, that don't necessarily\n\n348\n00:17:51.292 --> 00:17:54.230\npertain to your virtual machines but\nare used for other things in your company.\n\n349\n00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.150\nWell, guess what?\n\n350\n00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.810\nYour trunk is carrying those now.\n\n351\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.990\nAnd that's a lot of bandwidth\nthat's being wasted.\n\n352\n00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.772\nIf I had broadcasts that are going\nacross the research network,\n\n353\n00:18:01.772 --> 00:18:05.290\nI don't need to send those to my VMs,\ncuz my VMs aren't in the research network.\n\n354\n00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.850\nSo I'm just wasting\nbandwidth on this link.\n\n355\n00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.658\nAnd so to optimize that link,\nwe'd probably wanna filter out\n\n356\n00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:15.990\nany VLANs that don't specifically\npertain to our virtual machines.\n\n357\n00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:21.456\nAnd so you might wanna say\nswitchport trunk allowed vlan?\n\n358\n00:18:21.456 --> 00:18:23.487\nAnd then you can give, basically,\n\n359\n00:18:23.487 --> 00:18:26.816\na list of the vlans that you\nwant to allow to cross the line.\n\n360\n00:18:26.816 --> 00:18:31.096\nAnd so I might only want VLANS 10,\n20, and 30 and that's it.\n\n361\n00:18:31.096 --> 00:18:34.596\nAnd now the traffic for\nVLAN 1, VLAN 40, VLAN 50, and\n\n362\n00:18:34.596 --> 00:18:38.516\nany VLAN I create in the future Is\nnot gonna be sent over this line and\n\n363\n00:18:38.516 --> 00:18:42.436\nnow my bandwidth will be fully\ndedicated to those three networks.\n\n364\n00:18:42.436 --> 00:18:46.116\nInternet, intranet, extranet,\nnow I've got an optimal configuration.\n\n365\n00:18:46.116 --> 00:18:50.552\n>> You know, looking at that, Don, one of\nthe things that I can see that I notice\n\n366\n00:18:50.552 --> 00:18:54.316\nthat you have all of this information\nfiltering to a single port.\n\n367\n00:18:54.316 --> 00:18:58.508\nYou have, I mean this, looks like this\nport is relying, you're, your intranet,\n\n368\n00:18:58.508 --> 00:19:01.476\nyour extranet,\nyour internet is all relying on this port.\n\n369\n00:19:01.476 --> 00:19:04.016\nAll of the VLANS are relying on this port.\n\n370\n00:19:04.016 --> 00:19:05.696\nI'm thinking performance.\n\n371\n00:19:05.696 --> 00:19:08.256\nWhat happens if that port fails?\n\n372\n00:19:08.256 --> 00:19:09.116\n>> Then you're out of luck.\n\n373\n00:19:09.116 --> 00:19:09.916\n>> Nope.\n\n374\n00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:11.016\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Network's down.\n\n375\n00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:12.971\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so if the link fails,\n\n376\n00:19:12.971 --> 00:19:13.856\nthat's bad, right?\n\n377\n00:19:13.856 --> 00:19:15.636\nBut you can have more than one trunk.\n\n378\n00:19:15.636 --> 00:19:19.336\nSo remember, I said I might need\na server with four interfaces?\n\n379\n00:19:19.336 --> 00:19:24.029\nI could have one interface dedicated for\nmanagement, and I could take the other\n\n380\n00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:28.736\nthree interfaces and create a bonded trunk\nwhere all three of those are bonded.\n\n381\n00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:29.896\nLet’s say they're 1 GB adapters.\n\n382\n00:19:29.896 --> 00:19:32.276\nWell, now I get 3 GB of bandwidth,\nand if one of them fails,\n\n383\n00:19:32.276 --> 00:19:33.840\nthe other two are still up and running.\n\n384\n00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.703\nIf they're 10 GB adapters,\nI get 30 GB of bandwidth, and\n\n385\n00:19:36.703 --> 00:19:38.420\nyou can configure that pretty easy.\n\n386\n00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.848\nWhat you do is,\nyou take your trunk port And\n\n387\n00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:43.760\nyou put it into an aggregated\nport configuration.\n\n388\n00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.802\nAnd, the way an aggregated port works is,\nbasically,\n\n389\n00:19:46.802 --> 00:19:50.120\nI'm in port number 13 right now,\njust by itself, right?\n\n390\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.178\nBut, what I could do, is I could get\ninto more than one port, like here,\n\n391\n00:19:54.178 --> 00:19:56.320\nI'll get into ports 13, and 14.\n\n392\n00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.360\nOr, actually, you know what,\nlet's go a little bigger.\n\n393\n00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.660\nLet's go 13, 14, 15, and 16.\n\n394\n00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.520\nWe'll do four ports.\n\n395\n00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.925\nAll right, so I'm gonna take ports\n13 through 16 on this switch and\n\n396\n00:20:05.925 --> 00:20:08.717\nI can say, port-channel and I can,\n\n397\n00:20:08.717 --> 00:20:13.600\nhow about channel-group that's\nprobably the command I want.\n\n398\n00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.920\nChannel-group, there we go, and\nI can stick them in a channel-group.\n\n399\n00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.924\nAnd for that channel-group,\n\n400\n00:20:19.924 --> 00:20:23.860\nI can set it to a couple if\ndifferent aggregation protocols.\n\n401\n00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.504\nNow Cisco has some proprietary stuff, but\nthe one you want you want to remember for\n\n402\n00:20:26.504 --> 00:20:27.550\nthe exam is this guy right here.\n\n403\n00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.350\nThe link aggregation and\ncontrol protocol, LACP.\n\n404\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:34.850\nWhat LACP does is let you bond interfaces\ntogether, even if they're trunks.\n\n405\n00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.890\nAnd you can bond them together\nto create on single entity.\n\n406\n00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.425\nSo if I come in here and\nput this in active mode,\n\n407\n00:20:40.425 --> 00:20:42.710\nit's going to create that port channel.\n\n408\n00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.630\nAnd if I do a show etherchannel summary.\n\n409\n00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:47.710\nThere we go.\n\n410\n00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.695\nI can see I've got a port channel,\n\n411\n00:20:49.695 --> 00:20:53.270\nport channel one that's now\nbonding all four of these ports.\n\n412\n00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.370\nAnd they're not plugged in so\nall I'm showing is down right now.\n\n413\n00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.070\nBut it's bonding those together.\n\n414\n00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:01.330\nOn your virtualization host,\nit likely supports LACP also.\n\n415\n00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.470\nAnd so you can tell it, hey,\nyou're now bonded like this.\n\n416\n00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:07.448\nAnd now I've got four links all run\nbetween my server and this switch,\n\n417\n00:21:07.448 --> 00:21:08.797\nall bonded together and\n\n418\n00:21:08.797 --> 00:21:12.450\nI get four times the bandwidth and\nredundancy if one link fails.\n\n419\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.890\nAnd it load balances across these, right?\n\n420\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.990\nSo you really get some\nreally big benefits there.\n\n421\n00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.250\nYou probably want to keep your\nmanagement interface out of this, right.\n\n422\n00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.063\nYou don't want to bother your management\ninterface cause you always need your\n\n423\n00:21:23.063 --> 00:21:24.350\nmanagement interface available.\n\n424\n00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.690\nOtherwise, how are you\ngoing to trouble shoot?\n\n425\n00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.190\nBut your other interfaces you\nmight choose to bond like this.\n\n426\n00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.638\nOne negative of bonding like this though,\n\n427\n00:21:30.638 --> 00:21:34.310\nis it only works if all those\nadaptors are run to the same switch.\n\n428\n00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.950\nI would have to plug in all of my\nadapters right here into this one switch.\n\n429\n00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.990\nWhat if I have more than one switch,\nand this switch fails?\n\n430\n00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.450\nWell, then I gotta go unplug some\ncables and move them, right?\n\n431\n00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.350\nSo a lot of virtual user platforms have\nalternatives to this that you can use.\n\n432\n00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:52.073\nSo for example VMware, they've got where\nyou can create these distributed virtual\n\n433\n00:21:52.073 --> 00:21:56.797\nswitches and you can create ports that are\nmaybe on completely separate switches and\n\n434\n00:21:56.797 --> 00:21:58.010\nbond them together.\n\n435\n00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.310\nAnd it uses its own technology that\nthe switches aren't even aware of.\n\n436\n00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:04.550\nIt just uses these MAC address' that\nit pushes out into the switches.\n\n437\n00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.910\nSo it basically teaches\nthe switches what to do.\n\n438\n00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.030\nSo there's a few different\nconfigurations that we can see there.\n\n439\n00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.290\nActually, let me show that.\n\n440\n00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.870\nWe can jump over to a VMware environment.\n\n441\n00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.930\nAll right, so here I am in VMware's\nvSphere, or vCenter, actually.\n\n442\n00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.850\nAnd so I'm in vCenter, and\nI'm just gonna jump into Networking.\n\n443\n00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.921\nAnd inside of Networking, you start to see\nyour server and resource groups over here,\n\n444\n00:22:22.921 --> 00:22:24.890\nand I've got a virtual machine network.\n\n445\n00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:29.370\nBut what I'm gonna create is\na new vSphere distributed switch.\n\n446\n00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.490\nAnd the distributed switch, that's\nthe virtual switch inside of vSphere.\n\n447\n00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.088\nI know we saw virtual switches in another\nepisode, but I'm just going to whip on up\n\n448\n00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:39.130\nand I'll vSphere6 here so\nI can get all the nice bells and whistles.\n\n449\n00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.973\nAnd when I go to create this, it's really\njust going to ask me a few things,\n\n450\n00:22:42.973 --> 00:22:45.791\nlike how many uplinks do I\nintend to add to this switch?\n\n451\n00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:50.070\nAnd you can choose, and notice how\nit's set to have up to four uplinks.\n\n452\n00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.584\nThat means that this one virtual switch\ncan have up to four network adapters\n\n453\n00:22:53.584 --> 00:22:56.670\nattached to it for load balancing and\nlink aggregation, right?\n\n454\n00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.693\nSo they've got that support kind of\nbuilt right in Regardless of whether\n\n455\n00:22:59.693 --> 00:23:00.790\nyour switch supports it.\n\n456\n00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.639\nIf your switch supports it great,\nbut if your switch doesn’t,\n\n457\n00:23:03.639 --> 00:23:06.290\nit uses it's own technology\nto bounce across those links.\n\n458\n00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.348\nAll right, I'm gonna cut mine down\nto two because I only have so\n\n459\n00:23:09.348 --> 00:23:10.570\nmany adaptors so [LAUGH].\n\n460\n00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.090\nSo I'll go ahead and\nchoose that and then I'll hit next.\n\n461\n00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:16.241\nAnd then it's gonna ask me\nwhat physical hosts and\n\n462\n00:23:16.241 --> 00:23:19.330\nadapters are gonna\nparticipate inside of that.\n\n463\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:24.230\nAnd so when I look, I've got this one ESX\nserver right here and I've got VM Nick1,\n\n464\n00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:25.010\n2, and 3.\n\n465\n00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.203\nWell, I'm gonna add VM Nicks 2 and\n3 cuz I'm using 1 for management and\n\n466\n00:23:28.203 --> 00:23:30.430\nI don't wanna lock myself\nout of the server right?\n\n467\n00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.467\nSo I'm gonna add these two network\nadapters to that virtual switch, and\n\n468\n00:23:34.467 --> 00:23:36.330\nthen it's just gonna lay it out.\n\n469\n00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.990\nSo notice, here's my virtual switch, and\nI've got a port group attached to it.\n\n470\n00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.470\nAnd see how it's even identifying\na VLAN ID right here.\n\n471\n00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.830\nNow, there aren't any VLANs to find yet.\n\n472\n00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:45.917\nSo we'll see those in a minute.\n\n473\n00:23:45.917 --> 00:23:48.490\nBut it's got it with no\nvirtual machines attached,\n\n474\n00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.532\nand here's my two physical adapters,\nvmnic2 and vmnic3,\n\n475\n00:23:51.532 --> 00:23:55.643\nthat we're aggregating together, and\nthat we're gonna be load balancing upon.\n\n476\n00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:59.431\nAnd when I finish that I've now\ngot this virtual switch, and\n\n477\n00:23:59.431 --> 00:24:03.738\nas I plug virtual machines into it,\nthey're going to have access and\n\n478\n00:24:03.738 --> 00:24:07.480\nthat's going to be balanced\nacross this port group.\n\n479\n00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.770\nThey'll get that functionality,\n\n480\n00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.390\nthey'll get that access, and\nnow hopefully they'll be up and running.\n\n481\n00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.530\nI can see those links are up and\nthey're happy, and\n\n482\n00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.030\nnow I can start attaching\nvirtual machines to it.\n\n483\n00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:21.040\nNow notice when I go in here and I look at\nthese things, I don't really see much in\n\n484\n00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.180\nhere as far as identifying VLAN,\nand that's because we don't really\n\n485\n00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.790\nconfigure that here on the switch itself,\nwe configure that on our virtual machines.\n\n486\n00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.600\nWhen you spin up your virtual machines\nin your network adapter settings,\n\n487\n00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.160\nyou have the option to\npick what VLAN you want.\n\n488\n00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.170\nI don't think I have any VLANs running\non this one, but if I jump over here,\n\n489\n00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.108\nI actually got a Hyper-V server,\nthis one, perfect.\n\n490\n00:24:40.108 --> 00:24:43.550\nOn this Hyper-V server, see how I've\ngot a couple of servers sitting here,\n\n491\n00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.850\nthese are virtual machines.\n\n492\n00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:45.920\nI've got an Exchange server,\n\n493\n00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.810\nso that's like an email server I'd want\nmy internal people to have access to.\n\n494\n00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:50.830\nI've got a spam filter,\n\n495\n00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.980\nthat's where I'd want to filter\nemail coming in to my organization.\n\n496\n00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.900\nI'd want that to be exposed to my\nextranet or even the Internet, and\n\n497\n00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.350\nthen I've got a Web server, right?\n\n498\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.270\nThe Web server, I might want\nthat to be on the Internet for\n\n499\n00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:05.350\neverybody to see or an extranet for\na third-party vendor to see, right?\n\n500\n00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.830\nWhen I take these virtual machines,\nI can edit them,\n\n501\n00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:13.250\nand when I jump into their settings,\nwe can go into their Network Adapter and\n\n502\n00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.530\nnotice right here in the network adapter,\nVLAN ID.\n\n503\n00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:19.620\nI attach it to a physical adapter, like\nhere, I'll attach it to the ITProTV Studio\n\n504\n00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.830\nnetwork, and then I can give it a VLAN,\nand what server did I pick?\n\n505\n00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.880\nExchange, so this is Exchange, I want it\nto be available to my internal people.\n\n506\n00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:31.530\nI'm gonna put that on VLAN 10,\nand once it's on VLAN 10, now\n\n507\n00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:36.970\nany traffic that I send from this server\nwill get tagged as being on VLAN 10.\n\n508\n00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.465\nWhen my switch receives it,\nit'll see that tag,\n\n509\n00:25:39.465 --> 00:25:43.150\nit'll say, let me put this on VLAN 10,\ndon't let it see any other VLAN.\n\n510\n00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:47.315\nWhen I receive traffic on VLAN 10, I see\nthe tag and I look for all of my virtual\n\n511\n00:25:47.315 --> 00:25:51.293\nmachines that are tagged that way, and\nI set it to those virtual machines,\n\n512\n00:25:51.293 --> 00:25:54.919\nand it all happens right here inside\nof the virtual machine itself.\n\n513\n00:25:54.919 --> 00:25:59.110\nHyper-V, in this case,\nautomatically detects that trunk, right?\n\n514\n00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.670\nNow quick word of caution,\njust to throw in here,\n\n515\n00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:06.500\nnot every network adapter\nsupports VLAN tagging, all right?\n\n516\n00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.040\nNow a lot of them do,\nyour server grade ones do, but\n\n517\n00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.430\nif you're doing this on a desktop, you may\nfind that your VLAN tags don't work, and\n\n518\n00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.960\nlet me just show you, I'm gonna\ngo into my Adapter Settings here.\n\n519\n00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.790\nI've got an Intel 82574L\nGigabit network connection, and\n\n520\n00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.020\nthat particular adapter,\nnot only does it support tagging,\n\n521\n00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:27.460\nbut it's automatically on, so it's on and\nit's watching for those tags already.\n\n522\n00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:32.180\nBut on some adapters,\nif you go into their configuration and\n\n523\n00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.720\nyou dig into their Advanced Settings, some\nwill actually have an advanced setting in\n\n524\n00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.500\nhere where you've gotta\nturn that functionality on.\n\n525\n00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.320\nIf you've installed ESX or\n\n526\n00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.020\nif you've installed Citrix Xenserver,\nthey turn it on automatically, but\n\n527\n00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.800\nin Windows, if you're doing Hyper-V,\nyou may need to come in here.\n\n528\n00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.030\nOn mine it automatically does it, but you\nmay find an option in here where you have\n\n529\n00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.750\nto turn that on to support trunking, so\njust be aware of that on the server side,\n\n530\n00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.670\nand you've gotta make sure you're speaking\nthat same language as your switch.\n\n531\n00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:01.360\nAll right, so I think that pretty\nmuch wraps up VLAN tagging.\n\n532\n00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.830\nWhat else do we have here?\n\n533\n00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.620\nAnother thing worth mentioning, all right?\n\n534\n00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.140\nJust cuz I happen to notice it right here,\n\n535\n00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.360\nso this TCP Checksum Offload for\nIPv4 and IPv6,\n\n536\n00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.750\nthis is another one of those features\nthat not every network adapter has.\n\n537\n00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:21.254\nIf you remember your OSI model, right,\nthe seven layer OSI model, your network\n\n538\n00:27:21.254 --> 00:27:25.759\nadapter is one of those things that skirts\nthe line between layer one and layer two.\n\n539\n00:27:25.759 --> 00:27:29.152\nLayer one, cuz it's got a physical\ninterface, but it's layer two,\n\n540\n00:27:29.152 --> 00:27:33.030\ncuz the MAC address is burned into\nthe network adapter, it's both, right?\n\n541\n00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.520\nWhen you receive electricity\non that network adapter,\n\n542\n00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:41.430\nit gets the layer one electricity, it then\nconverts it into the bits of data and\n\n543\n00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.770\nstarts to look at the data link\ninformation, which is layer two.\n\n544\n00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:47.000\nBut when we get to layer three,\nthat's IP addressing, right?\n\n545\n00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.800\nWhen we get to layer four, that's our\ntransport protocol, usually TCP or UDP, so\n\n546\n00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.190\nthat layer three and layer four stuff,\nthat's usually done in software, right?\n\n547\n00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.040\nIt hands over to our operating system and\nour OS starts to do it.\n\n548\n00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.980\nWell, when you've got a standalone server,\na dedicated server that's performing\n\n549\n00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.420\none task, it's only got so\nmuch traffic to deal with.\n\n550\n00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:11.030\nWhen you're carrying multiple VLANs and\nyou've got 15 VMs that are all\n\n551\n00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.780\ndoing transmissions, that's a lot of\nsoftware decoding that we're having to do.\n\n552\n00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.280\nA lot of software session building and\nsequence number realignment and\n\n553\n00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.600\nall that stuff, it's just a lot of work.\n\n554\n00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.220\nAnd so, in servers a lot of times you'll\nfind where the network adapters support\n\n555\n00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.600\nwhat's called a TCP offload engine,\nor TOE.\n\n556\n00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.920\nHere they're calling it\nTCP Checksum Offload, but\n\n557\n00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.690\non the adapters is normally TOE, right?\n\n558\n00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.140\nOn a dedicated server, we don't\nreally care all that much about it,\n\n559\n00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.050\nmaybe on a file server, but on your normal\nlike DNS or domain controller, whatever,\n\n560\n00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.250\nyou don't really care about it.\n\n561\n00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:45.600\nBut on a virtualization host,\nit really makes a difference.\n\n562\n00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.680\nIt takes that layer four transport\nprotocol and the work that it does,\n\n563\n00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.400\nthe sequence numbers and all that,\nand it does it in hardware, so\n\n564\n00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.040\ninstead of relying on your software,\nyour general purpose CPU,\n\n565\n00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.670\nto do it, it can do it right\nhere in dedicated hardware.\n\n566\n00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.600\nNotice on mine, not only does it\nsupport it, but it's turned on, right?\n\n567\n00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.160\nYou can tweak that and turn it off, or\nset it to receive or transmit only.\n\n568\n00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.490\nYou want it on, right?\n\n569\n00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:09.740\nNot only do you want it on, you want to\nmake sure when you buy your adapters that\n\n570\n00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.740\nthis is something you think about.\n\n571\n00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.930\nWhen I go shopping for an adapter,\nI want it to have a TCP offload engine.\n\n572\n00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.030\nIt's pretty common these days,\nit used to be pretty rare, and\n\n573\n00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.450\nyou had to pay a lot more to get it.\n\n574\n00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:22.820\nThese days it's built into most server\nNICs, but if you're using desktop grade\n\n575\n00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:26.660\nNICs, they're not gonna have this and your\nperformance is gonna suffer as a result.\n\n576\n00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.970\n>> Your virtualization host,\n\n577\n00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.710\nit is important just like we talked about\nin other virtualization episodes that that\n\n578\n00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.030\nphysical network adapter is\nobviously going to be important.\n\n579\n00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:38.650\nWithout the physical network adapter, the\nvirtual network adapters don't work, and\n\n580\n00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:42.150\nas you start adding more VMs,\nyou start adding more trunks,\n\n581\n00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:45.520\nyou're definitely going to have to pay\nattention to this as far as speed and\n\n582\n00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.520\nthe type of network adapters you buy.\n\n583\n00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.990\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n584\n00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:53.060\nYou mentioned speed, when you buy network\nadapters, you can get 100 megabit\n\n585\n00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.650\nadapters, you can get gigabit adapters,\nyou can get 10 gig adapters, right?\n\n586\n00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:00.510\nYou need to make sure that you buy\nthe adapters that are right for\n\n587\n00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.650\nthe amount of traffic you're\ngoing to be handling, right?\n\n588\n00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.350\nYou've got to look at\nthe bandwidth utilization of\n\n589\n00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:07.630\neach of your virtual machines and\nadd it all up and say, hey, at peak time,\n\n590\n00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.970\nwhat is the maximum amount of bandwidth\nI might be pushing out of these VMs?\n\n591\n00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.330\nDo I have the physical\ninfrastructure to handle that?\n\n592\n00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.330\nBecause if you don't,\nyour network performance is gonna suffer.\n\n593\n00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:20.550\nYou might have a file server that normally\nruns just fine on a gig connection, but\n\n594\n00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:23.420\nwhen you virtualize it and\nit's sitting next to a Web server and\n\n595\n00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.990\na database server and a few other things,\nyou might find the network gets saturated.\n\n596\n00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:28.920\nNow the server is slower\nwhen it's virtualized, and\n\n597\n00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.640\nyou start blaming\nthe virtualization platform, but\n\n598\n00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.190\nit's not the platform's fault.\n\n599\n00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:35.197\nIt's that you've got more than one\nresource all sharing that single gig\n\n600\n00:30:35.197 --> 00:30:37.772\nconnection, so\nin those scenarios you've got two choices.\n\n601\n00:30:37.772 --> 00:30:41.732\nChoice number one,\nis to add more network adapters, right?\n\n602\n00:30:41.732 --> 00:30:43.927\nYou could add more network adapters,\nbond them together and\n\n603\n00:30:43.927 --> 00:30:45.490\nyou will get more bandwidth.\n\n604\n00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:48.070\nOr choice number two,\nI guess it's three choices, right?\n\n605\n00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:51.860\nBecause you could buy a faster adapter, if\nyou've got gig, you guys buy ten gig, but\n\n606\n00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:56.020\nif you've got ten gig, there's not really\nanything above that to buy, right?\n\n607\n00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.690\nAt that point, what you may need to do\nis go to dedicated network adapters.\n\n608\n00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:01.610\nJust because these machines\n\n609\n00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:04.120\nare virtualized doesn't mean they\ncan't have a dedicated adapter.\n\n610\n00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.995\nI might buy an extra network adapter card\nto stick in my host and say this one\n\n611\n00:31:07.995 --> 00:31:11.886\nvirtual machine is the only thing\nattached to that one physical adapter.\n\n612\n00:31:11.886 --> 00:31:14.311\nNow it's got a dedicated adapter and\nit gets all the bandwidth it needs.\n\n613\n00:31:14.311 --> 00:31:17.290\nThat may be necessary especially\non a file server, right?\n\n614\n00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.980\nOr a database server that's\ndoing live replication.\n\n615\n00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.440\nYou want to ensure that replication\nis as low latency as possible.\n\n616\n00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.451\nYou want a dedicated link to do that,\nso you get those extra network adapters,\n\n617\n00:31:25.451 --> 00:31:28.080\nyou get them put in there,\nand now you get it going, so\n\n618\n00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.940\nthinking about the quantity of your\nnetwork adapters is important.\n\n619\n00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.510\nWhen I deploy virtual machine hosts,\n\n620\n00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:35.450\nI pretty much always deploy four adapters,\nright?\n\n621\n00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:36.840\nMostly cuz you can't buy three,\n\n622\n00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.420\nyou go from one to two to four usually,\nbut I like to have one adapter for\n\n623\n00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:46.190\nmanagement and then two adapters\nbonded for my virtual machines.\n\n624\n00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:47.800\nThat's kind of what I like to have.\n\n625\n00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.830\nIf I need any other dedicated NICs,\nthen I'll bring those in for VMs.\n\n626\n00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.680\nI might have more, or\nif I wanna do more than two bonded NICs,\n\n627\n00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.310\nthen we may do that too and\nbring those in, but\n\n628\n00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:59.720\nusually I do a minimum of three\nadapters for virtual machine host.\n\n629\n00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.250\nIf you're doing iSCSI or\nany kind of network attached storage,\n\n630\n00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.710\nyou may want to have\ndedicated adapters for\n\n631\n00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:07.860\nthat, and so in those scenarios,\nI'll usually go up to like five adapters.\n\n632\n00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.910\nOne adapter dedicated for management,\ntwo bonded for virtual machine data, and\n\n633\n00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:16.480\ntwo bonded for storage data, so I've got\ndedicated storage network performance.\n\n634\n00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.650\nIt's up to you how many adapters you need.\n\n635\n00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.070\nJust remember, if you're trying\nto set up some kind of a cluster,\n\n636\n00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.752\nwhere VMs can fail over from\none host to another to another.\n\n637\n00:32:23.752 --> 00:32:28.820\nVMware's VMotion, where you can live\nmigrate a VM from one host to another,\n\n638\n00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.930\nyou gotta have a similar\nconfiguration in each.\n\n639\n00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:34.340\nOtherwise, the VM is going to\njump over to another host and\n\n640\n00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.650\nnot have a network connection, and then\nit might as well be turned off, right?\n\n641\n00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.370\nAnd so that's something to think about.\n\n642\n00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.990\n>> All right,\ngreat information there, Don.\n\n643\n00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:42.420\nWe've gone through a lot today,\nwe've talked about VLANs,\n\n644\n00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.980\nthe virtual local area networks.\n\n645\n00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.700\nWe've also showed you some examples of how\nto set them up, we've talked about how\n\n646\n00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.830\nif you need increased performance,\nbecause maybe you have a lot of machines\n\n647\n00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.550\nconnecting to a single point,\nyou can bond them together, right?\n\n648\n00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:57.670\nTake multiple ports, aggregate them,\nand you have a super port, if you will.\n\n649\n00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:01.330\nWe've also talked about the network\nadapters themselves and\n\n650\n00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:04.470\nsome of the criteria,\nsome of the characteristics or\n\n651\n00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:07.780\nspecifications you need to keep in mind\nwhen you are going to support this.\n\n652\n00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.550\nDon, do you have anything else for us?\n\n653\n00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:10.290\n>> I think that's about it.\n\n654\n00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:13.650\nWe are going to do a little bit more\nnetworking in the next episode so\n\n655\n00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:18.250\ncheck that out, but as far VLANs and\nthe quantities reports,\n\n656\n00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:21.720\nthe port aggregation and stuff,\nthat's a pretty good rundown of it.\n\n657\n00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.660\nJust remember that, depending on\nthe solution you guys go with,\n\n658\n00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:27.430\ndepending on the vendors of hardware you\nuse, you may have to apply this a little\n\n659\n00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.720\nbit differently, but\nthe concept is always the same.\n\n660\n00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.630\n>> All right, well, then, bringing this\nepisode to a close, I've been your host,\n\n661\n00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:34.610\nWes Bryan.\n\n662\n00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:35.470\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n663\n00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:39.405\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n664\n00:33:39.405 -->

your host Wes Brian,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.060\nwe're going to be continuing\nalong with cloud plus.\n\n5\n00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.290\nAnd we're going to be looking more\nspecifically at network optimizations day.\n\n6\n00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.560\nAnd we have on hand to help us out with\neverything that is known as the Cloud,\n\n7\n00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.420\nMr Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.670\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.740\n>> I am doing great Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.300\nReady to jump right back into the world of\nnetworking on a virtualization platform.\n\n11\n00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.030\nIn the last episode,\n\n12\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.970\nwe talked about some of the advanced\nnetworking features that are out there.\n\n13\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.790\nAnd in this episode,\n\n14\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.840\nwe're going to be just taking a look\nat ways that we can optimize.\n\n15\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.800\nAnd troubleshoot\nthe networks that we've got.\n\n16\n00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.210\nAnd there's definitely some\nconsiderations we have to have,\n\n17\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.920\nwhen we deploy this\ntype of infrastructure.\n\n18\n00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.480\nAnd that pretty much anybody is\ngoing to to have to deal with.\n\n19\n00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.040\nThe first thing I want to address is,\nthat in the last episode we talked about\n\n20\n00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.350\nthree network divisions,\nthat Comptia makes.\n\n21\n00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.910\nInternet, intranet, and extranet.\n\n22\n00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.750\nAnd those are as they\npertain to our servers and\n\n23\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.090\nwho those servers are available to.\n\n24\n00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.630\nSo I said at the time,\nthat an intranet system,\n\n25\n00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.175\nthat was the server that was\navailable to our internal employees.\n\n26\n00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:12.880\nAn extranet system, was the one that\nwas available to our customers.\n\n27\n00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.456\nOr third party vendors that\nwe were partnered with.\n\n28\n00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:18.390\nAn internet system's were one's\nconnected to the internet.\n\n29\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.820\nThat were public to the whole world,\nanybody connected to the internet.\n\n30\n00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.500\nWell those terms, are really describing\nthe networks and the virtual machines and\n\n31\n00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.110\nwhat their exposure is.\n\n32\n00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.510\nBut there's another set of terms that\nCompTIA wants you to be aware of\n\n33\n00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.370\nfor the exam.\n\n34\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.270\nThat really describe\nthe connection itself, right.\n\n35\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.900\nAnd those are WAN, LAN,\nand MAN, all right.\n\n36\n00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.240\nLets start with WAN,\nWAN is wide area network.\n\n37\n00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.860\nAnd a wide area network, that's usually\nyour connection to the internet.\n\n38\n00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.240\nBut it can also be private\nconnections between you and\n\n39\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.370\nyour branch offices, right.\n\n40\n00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.240\nAnd WANs don't have to\nbe internet connections.\n\n41\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.690\nThey don't have to be public,\nbut they oftentimes are.\n\n42\n00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.610\nSo, with a wide area network,\nthese are not lines that you own.\n\n43\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.200\nThis is not something that you control.\n\n44\n00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.500\nIt's a link that runs,\ntypically from your home office to an ISP.\n\n45\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.170\nThat gives you Internet access, or\nfrom your home office to a branch office.\n\n46\n00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.230\nBut the lines themselves\nare owned by who knows who?\n\n47\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.010\nA level three AT&T cogent, whoever it\nis that you're buying your lines from.\n\n48\n00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.230\nThey're the ones that are providing that\nand you basically lease them, right.\n\n49\n00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.080\nA lot of people call them leased lines,\nbecause you're paying every month for\n\n50\n00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.994\naccess to that line.\n\n51\n00:02:24.994 --> 00:02:27.950\nT-ones would be an example of this.\n\n52\n00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.700\nThere's other technologies like\nframe relay and MPLS circuits and\n\n53\n00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.220\nall sorts of technologies like that.\n\n54\n00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.310\nThose are a part of wide area networks.\n\n55\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.920\nBut also we've got cable modems and\nDSL, right.\n\n56\n00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.750\nthe high speed broadband connections,\nthose fall under wide area networks also.\n\n57\n00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.940\nNow, why do I bring that up here?\n\n58\n00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.445\nBecause we're talking\nabout virtualization,\n\n59\n00:02:47.445 --> 00:02:48.650\nwhat do we care about that?\n\n60\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.050\nWell, the big thing we need\nto be concerned with is,\n\n61\n00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.320\nthat a wide area network.\n\n62\n00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.980\nIs normally the lowest amount of\nbandwidth you have in your communication.\n\n63\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.490\nWhen a customer connects to you or\nyour end users connect.\n\n64\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.920\nIt's usually the wide area network\nthat serves as a bottleneck.\n\n65\n00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.830\nSo, anytime you have virtual machines\nthat are exposed to a wide area network.\n\n66\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.520\nThey need to be efficient.\n\n67\n00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.900\nThey need to be as efficient as\npossible to make use of the bandwidth\n\n68\n00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.090\nthat they have.\n\n69\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.420\nIf we're doing things like live\nmigrating virtual machines.\n\n70\n00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.100\nI have a virtual machine\nthat's running on host one and\n\n71\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.700\nI want to fail it over to host two.\n\n72\n00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.400\nWell, if those two hosts are right next\nto each other on the same network.\n\n73\n00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.090\nYou're going to get the best\nperformance possible.\n\n74\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.840\nYou can fail over, your end users won't\neven notice the system goes offline.\n\n75\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.260\nIt's a smooth and fluid motion, right.\n\n76\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.030\nBut a VM host 01 is in your headquarters.\n\n77\n00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.380\nAnd VM host 02 is in your disaster\nrecovery center, halfway across the state,\n\n78\n00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.290\nor even in another country.\n\n79\n00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.830\nWell, your replication between those two\nsystems is going to have some latency\n\n80\n00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.680\nto it, right.\n\n81\n00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.660\nYour wide area network doesn't\nhave enough bandwidth to be doing\n\n82\n00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.690\nreal time replication.\n\n83\n00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.580\nAnd so, you end up with delays, and\nif you want to do a fail over like that,\n\n84\n00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.720\nyour end users do see it.\n\n85\n00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.540\nThey see that it takes time to make\nit over to the other side, and\n\n86\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.350\nthen that is a bit of a problem, right.\n\n87\n00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.870\nSo, that's something that we\nneed to keep an eye out for\n\n88\n00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.320\nwhen we're building up our topologies.\n\n89\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.960\nThat you want to have\na disaster recovery center.\n\n90\n00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.465\nYou want to have these other locations,\nthat might be out there on a WAN.\n\n91\n00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:11.970\nBut, you don't want to do things like\nvirtual machine replication over them.\n\n92\n00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.420\nIf you're trying to minimize the latency,\nright.\n\n93\n00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.170\nSo, I might need to maintain multiple\nreplicas of the server in my headquarters.\n\n94\n00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.790\nI don't want to have just one VM Host.\n\n95\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.330\nI might want to have five or ten or\neven 100 VM hosts, to host all my guests,\n\n96\n00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.170\nall my virtual machines.\n\n97\n00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.710\nBut at my disaster recovery center,\nI might only have 10 or 15 of them.\n\n98\n00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.500\nAnd just my mission critical servers\nare getting replicated to the other side.\n\n99\n00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.035\nI'm trying to optimize that link.\n\n100\n00:04:36.035 --> 00:04:37.405\nOn the local area network,\non the LAN side,\n\n101\n00:04:37.405 --> 00:04:39.835\nusually that's where we\nhave the most bandwidth.\n\n102\n00:04:39.835 --> 00:04:41.365\nYou have tons of bandwidth internally.\n\n103\n00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:43.995\nAnd so, you can do things\nlike replicating clusters and\n\n104\n00:04:43.995 --> 00:04:45.205\ntake all the bandwidth you want.\n\n105\n00:04:45.205 --> 00:04:46.505\nYou'll have a little latency.\n\n106\n00:04:46.505 --> 00:04:48.695\nThings work great in\nyour local area network.\n\n107\n00:04:48.695 --> 00:04:50.345\nThe problem is,\nif your building is destroyed,\n\n108\n00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:52.055\nyour whole local area\nnetwork is destroyed.\n\n109\n00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:53.865\nYou just lost all that access.\n\n110\n00:04:53.865 --> 00:04:54.695\nThat's why it's so\n\n111\n00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:58.660\nimportant to have a WAN somewhere\nthat you can replicate to, right.\n\n112\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.030\nNow, the third one that\nI mentioned is a MAN.\n\n113\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.920\nAnd that's a Metropolitan Area Network.\n\n114\n00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.740\nAnd this is a great middle\nground between LAN and WAN.\n\n115\n00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.100\nFor example, I used to work for\na bank out in Seattle.\n\n116\n00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.530\nAnd we had our headquarters\nright there in downtown Seattle.\n\n117\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.220\nAnd, we were part of the Metropolitan\nArea Network with Quest Communications,\n\n118\n00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.920\nwhich Quest is now.\n\n119\n00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.690\nWho is Qwest now?\n\n120\n00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.300\nSomebody bought them,\neverybody gets acquired these days.\n\n121\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.010\nSo, Qwest put us on their fiber link.\n\n122\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.240\nAnd they basically had a ring of fiber\nthat ran all around downtown Seattle.\n\n123\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.760\nAnd ran out to Bellevue and even Redmond,\nso this pretty big loop of fiber.\n\n124\n00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.180\nAnd because,\nthey had this really big loop,\n\n125\n00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.460\nwe could put a second data\ncenter anywhere on that loop.\n\n126\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.960\nWe could put a data center in Bellevue.\n\n127\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.870\nWe could put a data center in Redmond,.\n\n128\n00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.590\nAnd we'd have a gig,\nten gigs of connectivity between us and\n\n129\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.690\nthat other location.\n\n130\n00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.870\nSo, you've got a line that's\nkind of like a WAN, right.\n\n131\n00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.010\nKind of like a wide area network,\n\n132\n00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.190\nexcept we don't have the bandwidth\nconstraints like normal.\n\n133\n00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.830\nYou've got a fiber optic\nconnection that's high bandwidth.\n\n134\n00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.910\nNow it doesn't go to far.\n\n135\n00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.010\nOur biggest challenge was that Bellevue,\nRedmond, Seattle.\n\n136\n00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.990\nThey're all on the same tectonic plate.\n\n137\n00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.820\nAnd so, if you have an earthquake or\na volcano erupt or whatever.\n\n138\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.920\nThey're all susceptible\nto the same disaster.\n\n139\n00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.720\nSo, a man isn't a perfect\nsolution in that scenario.\n\n140\n00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.200\nWe needed to have data center\nthat was on a different plate.\n\n141\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.240\nAnd so, we put our disaster\nrecovery center was out in Spokane.\n\n142\n00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.650\nAfter that,\nwe had to have a wide area network.\n\n143\n00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.405\nYou had to have that wide\narea network connectivity.\n\n144\n00:06:23.405 --> 00:06:26.720\nbecause it was just too far away\nto get a metropolitan area.\n\n145\n00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.260\nSo, be aware that there's three\ndifferent types of connections there.\n\n146\n00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.680\nOn a LAN and on a MAN,\nyou typically have tons of bandwidth.\n\n147\n00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.430\nAnd so, you don't have to be as efficient.\n\n148\n00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.750\nBut when you're dealing with\nthe wide area, the WAN.\n\n149\n00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.042\nNetwork efficiency is really important and\n\n150\n00:06:40.042 --> 00:06:42.640\nyou only want the critical\ntraffic going across that.\n\n151\n00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.620\nAnd so, if you're replicating your virtual\nmachines or trying to do migrations.\n\n152\n00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.110\nYou may need dedicated WAN connectivity,\njust for that.\n\n153\n00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.500\nAnd that way your customer data's\non a separate set of links.\n\n154\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.020\n>> When in thinking about these WANs,\nand LANs, and MANs here, if you will.\n\n155\n00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.910\nOne of the things I know that,\nback when I first started studying A+,\n\n156\n00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.630\nI got confused with that.\n\n157\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.540\nThe fact that the Internet, I figured\nthe Internet, that's the WAN, right?\n\n158\n00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.790\nThat's got tp be the WAN, but it's not.\n\n159\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.480\nReally, the classification of a WAN like\nDon said, it's not just the Internet.\n\n160\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.768\nIt's typically multiple networks, but\nseparated by great geographical distances.\n\n161\n00:07:16.768 --> 00:07:19.770\nEhere your LAN is a single\ngeographical location,\n\n162\n00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.670\nyour MAN being shorter\ngeographical locations.\n\n163\n00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.810\nAll right, Don,\nwhen we look at these connections,\n\n164\n00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.940\nwe obviously have to worry about\nthe quality of the connections.\n\n165\n00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.170\nAnd how we can maintain\na certain level performance.\n\n166\n00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.340\nRegardless of which way they face and\nwhich one we choose.\n\n167\n00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.450\nWhat do we have for those?\n\n168\n00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.220\n>> All right.\nWell, it really depends on your platform,\n\n169\n00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.650\nso if you have Citrix N Server, or\nVN Ware V Sphere or Microsoft Hyper V.\n\n170\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.370\nThey all have different\ntechnologies built into them,\n\n171\n00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.960\nwhere you can start to optimize\nyour networking connectivity.\n\n172\n00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.279\nWhere you can take some virtual machines\nand prioritize them over others.\n\n173\n00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:55.780\nYou can do quality of service and\nreserve bandwidth for some machines.\n\n174\n00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.044\nWhile restricting others,\ngiving them kinda ceilings.\n\n175\n00:07:58.044 --> 00:07:59.833\nYou can set thresholds, right?\n\n176\n00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:02.602\nMaximum amounts of bandwidth and\nminimum amounts, you can do the same thing\n\n177\n00:08:02.602 --> 00:08:05.470\nwith RAM and CPU, but\non the network side it's really important.\n\n178\n00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.190\nBut it depends on your platform, right?\n\n179\n00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.320\nFor example, I know in the last\nepisode I whipped up a VMWare vSphere\n\n180\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.520\nvirtual switch, let me pull that back up.\n\n181\n00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.300\nSo in the last episode I created this\nDV switch, and that's just a dynamic\n\n182\n00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.980\nvirtual switch inside of vSphere, and I\nthrew a couple of network adapters on it.\n\n183\n00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.470\nAnd what I didn't do is, I didn't go into\nany of the detailed settings inside of it,\n\n184\n00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.387\nbut if you pull up the settings of\nthat port group, what you'll see.\n\n185\n00:08:31.387 --> 00:08:34.280\nWhoops, [LAUGH] what you'll see\nif I can control my screen,\n\n186\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.060\nis that you've got a bunch of other\nfeatures in there that you can tweak.\n\n187\n00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.610\nIn the last episode I was\nfocused on VLANs, right?\n\n188\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.780\nAnd so in here I can come in and I can\ndesignate whether I'm doing a VLAN trunk\n\n189\n00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.680\nor a regular VLAN, like a single VLAN,\nand I can specify that.\n\n190\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.131\nAnd I was talking about Teaming and\nFailover in that last episode and so\n\n191\n00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:53.523\nyou'll see here where I can set how\nI wanna handle my Load Balancing or\n\n192\n00:08:53.523 --> 00:08:54.123\nFailover.\n\n193\n00:08:54.123 --> 00:09:00.330\nAnd that stuff's great, but it doesn't\ndetermine who gets access to what, right?\n\n194\n00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.030\nAll my virtual machines,\nit's on a first come, first served basis.\n\n195\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.930\nOne VM could completely saturate\nmy network, and it doesn't help.\n\n196\n00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.490\nBut you'll notice over here that I\ndo have some additional options like\n\n197\n00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.020\nTraffic Shaping.\n\n198\n00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.320\nTraffic Shaping is where I can jump in and\n\n199\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.890\nI can start to specify exactly\nhow I want to cap these machines.\n\n200\n00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.220\nNow, some systems have Traffic Shaping and\n\n201\n00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.630\nTraffic Policing,\nsome just have Traffic Policing.\n\n202\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.040\nThis one just has Traffic Shaping,\nall right?\n\n203\n00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.780\nWhat's the difference between shaping and\npolicing?\n\n204\n00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.710\nWell, with shaping,\nI set limits, I set a limit for\n\n205\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.400\nmy virtual machines on this switch.\n\n206\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.310\nAnd I say,\nlet's say I cap it at 2 megabits,\n\n207\n00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.260\nyou cannot communicate more\nthan 2 megabits per second.\n\n208\n00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.220\nWhat happens if I hit 2 megs?\n\n209\n00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:49.130\nWell, anything that's extra gets buffered,\nand then as soon as I dip back down,\n\n210\n00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.810\nthen I send it.\n\n211\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.020\nSo it just creates a little bit\nof latency, it delays me, but\n\n212\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.130\nit keeps me shaped at 2 megabits as\na maximum across the line, right?\n\n213\n00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.827\nThat's what Traffic Shaping is, you don't\nlose data, if you hit your threshold,\n\n214\n00:09:59.827 --> 00:10:02.705\nyou just get slower, and\nthat's normally what we want, right?\n\n215\n00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:05.690\nTraffic Policing is a little different.\n\n216\n00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.840\nIf I hit 2 megs and I start to go over,\n\n217\n00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.470\nit throws that traffic away,\nit just deletes it, and it's gone, right?\n\n218\n00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.550\nTraffic Policing is a lot more strict,\nand it's up to my operating systems,\n\n219\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.780\nmy VMs,\nthey've gotta figure out what happened.\n\n220\n00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.830\nLike, those packets didn't get to their\ndestination, I need to retransmit.\n\n221\n00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.250\nAnd so if you're doing Traffic Policing,\n\n222\n00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.890\nit puts the burden on\nthe virtual machines.\n\n223\n00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:31.230\nIf you're doing Traffic Shaping,\nit puts the burden on the VM host.\n\n224\n00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.478\nNow, because these are virtual,\nif I put the burden on the VM,\n\n225\n00:10:34.478 --> 00:10:38.706\nit's really the VM host that's having to\ndo that work anyway at the end of the day,\n\n226\n00:10:38.706 --> 00:10:40.700\nand so it really makes no difference.\n\n227\n00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.630\nAnd so that's why VMware just does\nTraffic Shaping, why bother with policing?\n\n228\n00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.270\nVersus on a dedicated server where\nyou might actually get benefits\n\n229\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.110\nfrom doing that.\n\n230\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.980\nSo a lot of times you'll\njust see Shaping like this.\n\n231\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.280\nNotice that I can shape traffic on the way\nin and shape traffic on the way out.\n\n232\n00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.080\nOn a physical adapter, you only shape on\nthe way out, because the traffic that's\n\n233\n00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.840\ncoming in is already coming in,\nthere's nothing you can do about it.\n\n234\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.470\nBut on a virtual switch,\nit's a different story.\n\n235\n00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.740\nThe traffic comes into\nthe physical adapter, and\n\n236\n00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.960\nthen logically I might have\nmany of these switches.\n\n237\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.140\nAnd I can shape each one individually and\noptimize them.\n\n238\n00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.020\nSo you actually have Ingress Traffic\nShaping, which is something you don't\n\n239\n00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.890\nnormally have,\nit's a neat benefit of virtualization.\n\n240\n00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.760\nAnd I can come in here and\nI can specify thresholds.\n\n241\n00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.476\nSo for example, if I wanna hold this\nparticular virtual switch to 2 megabit,\n\n242\n00:11:27.476 --> 00:11:31.416\nI might have a 100 megabit adapter, or\na gig, or even a 10 gig adapter, but for\n\n243\n00:11:31.416 --> 00:11:34.110\nwhatever reason I wanna\nhold this to 2 megabit.\n\n244\n00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.228\nMaybe this is a web server, right, or\n\n245\n00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:39.620\nthis virtual switch is my\nInternet virtual switch, right?\n\n246\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.050\nThis is the one that I'm plugging into\nthe Internet that's publicly exposed.\n\n247\n00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.610\nBut my Internet connection is,\nwell, you know what,\n\n248\n00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:49.070\nlet me use a real world example,\nI'm gonna try to keep this realistic.\n\n249\n00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.760\nHere at ITProTV we have\na fiber-optic connection that runs,\n\n250\n00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.158\nit's actually a part of\na metropolitan area network.\n\n251\n00:11:54.158 --> 00:11:56.990\nOur ISP is right here in town with us and\n\n252\n00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.640\nwe have a fiberlink that\nruns right to them, right?\n\n253\n00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.120\nBut we've got 80 megabits of bandwidth,\nwe have 80 megs up and 80 megs down.\n\n254\n00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.835\nNow when I plug that into our router,\nthe router sees it as a gig connection,\n\n255\n00:12:07.835 --> 00:12:10.610\ncuz it's one of those where we can call\nthe service provider and say, hey,\n\n256\n00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.860\nbump us up to 200 megabit, and they'll\ndo it right then, it's no big deal.\n\n257\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.010\nSo we see it as a gig adapter.\n\n258\n00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.630\nBut if I try and send a gig of data\nover that line, it's gonna get policed,\n\n259\n00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.680\nit's gonna get dropped and\nI'm gonna lose it.\n\n260\n00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.520\nSo I can come in here and I can say, for\n\n261\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.460\nmy WAN traffic, let's just hold\nthe virtual switch to 80 megabit.\n\n262\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.370\nSince my WAN connection is\nonly 80 megabit anyway,\n\n263\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.500\nwhy send any more than 80 megs to it?\n\n264\n00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.999\nAnd so now if a virtual machine tries\nto go over that it'll recognize it and\n\n265\n00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:40.074\nfilter it back, and it'll make sure that\nI don't over saturate my WAN link, right?\n\n266\n00:12:40.074 --> 00:12:42.120\nWe're kinda keeping things realistic.\n\n267\n00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.510\nSo I can come in here and specify an\nAverage Bandwidth, a Peak Bandwidth, and\n\n268\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.960\neven a Burst Size, if I want to burst\nover that peak in some scenarios, and\n\n269\n00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.540\nit will hold the traffic to that.\n\n270\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.920\nSo if I say that my Average Bandwidth,\nthis would be like kinda what I reserve or\n\n271\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.740\nset aside for this one.\n\n272\n00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:05.050\nSo I'm gonna say on average, maybe I'm at\n40 megabit, but my peak bandwidth might\n\n273\n00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.290\nbe, maybe I'll hold this to 60, cuz I've\ngot other things going on in my network.\n\n274\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.650\nI don't want to give all of it away,\nbut I'll allow myself to burst\n\n275\n00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.620\nall the way up to a certain size, and\nyou can specify that Burst Size here.\n\n276\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.575\n[COUGH] Notice that my Burst Size\nright now is set to 102 megs.\n\n277\n00:13:22.575 --> 00:13:26.349\nAnd so I can bump that to whatever\nit is that I want it to me,\n\n278\n00:13:26.349 --> 00:13:28.720\nmaybe I just want it to be 80 megs.\n\n279\n00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.690\nSo I could burst up to the full\nsize of my WAN link, and\n\n280\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.430\nthat would be my incoming traffic.\n\n281\n00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.490\nNow, if I'm not worried about incoming,\nI might leave all of these as Disabled and\n\n282\n00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.370\njust do my Egress, my outgoing traffic,\nand start to shape it.\n\n283\n00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.280\nThe other thing to remember is\nthat this is only one VM host,\n\n284\n00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.670\nwhat if I've got ten VM hosts, right?\n\n285\n00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.390\nNow I've gotta shape the traffic\nacross all ten hosts and balance that,\n\n286\n00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.320\nthat becomes really hard.\n\n287\n00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.093\nAnd that's where technologies\nlike VWare really come in handy,\n\n288\n00:13:56.093 --> 00:13:58.845\nbecause this is a distributed\nvirtual switch.\n\n289\n00:13:58.845 --> 00:14:03.440\nThe virtual switch can stretch\nacross more than one host, right?\n\n290\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.200\nWhen I added an adapter back here,\n\n291\n00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.960\nif we look at my virtual switch and\nmy ports, right?\n\n292\n00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.870\nWhat I added was vmic2 and\nvmic3 for plabesx01,\n\n293\n00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:22.020\nbut I could add in adapters from esx02 and\nesx03 and\n\n294\n00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.940\nmy other servers, and now this one virtual\nswitch stretches across all of them.\n\n295\n00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.110\nAnd when I put this\nTraffic Shaping policy in place,\n\n296\n00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.520\nit applies to all of them as a whole.\n\n297\n00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.750\nSo now it makes a lot more sense,\ncuz if I take one server and\n\n298\n00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.060\nhold it to 80 megabit, and I take another\nserver and hold it to 80 megabit,\n\n299\n00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.920\ncombined they could do 160 megabit,\nand now I'm exceeding my bandwidth.\n\n300\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.150\nBut if I have a virtual switch that\nstretched across all those hosts,\n\n301\n00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.250\nnow combined they have 80 megabit,\nand that's a big benefit.\n\n302\n00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.720\n>> Now that burst parameter\nthat you set there, Don,\n\n303\n00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:56.170\nwould that be good in scenarios\nwhere maybe you're expecting not\n\n304\n00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:01.330\na consistent load, for instance,\nmaybe a holiday comes across.\n\n305\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.200\nYou got a web server, and you're expecting\na little bit more traffic than what\n\n306\n00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.320\nwould be there, let's say,\nany other given Monday through Friday.\n\n307\n00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.350\nWould that be almost like a,\nI don't wanna say a cushion, but\n\n308\n00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:13.925\na way that you could optimize for\nthose times?\n\n309\n00:15:13.925 --> 00:15:15.779\n>> Maybe,\nI wouldn't use a holiday as an example,\n\n310\n00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:17.282\ncuz a holiday's a long period of time.\n\n311\n00:15:17.282 --> 00:15:21.027\n[CROSSTALK] If you're a retail outlet,\nyou know that November and\n\n312\n00:15:21.027 --> 00:15:23.899\nDecember are big shopping times for\nyou, right?\n\n313\n00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:25.280\nThat's over months.\n\n314\n00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.320\n>> Okay, sure.\n>> And for that,\n\n315\n00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.920\nyou just need to adjust your thresholds,\nright?\n\n316\n00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.080\nBut every now and\n\n317\n00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.170\nthen you have spontaneous moments\nwhere you need that higher access.\n\n318\n00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:38.430\nMaybe your machine starts doing Windows\nupdates, or something crazy like that, and\n\n319\n00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.130\nit just for\n\n320\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.460\na few seconds needs that extra bandwidth,\nthat's where a burst comes in, right?\n\n321\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.090\nSo what we need to do is we need to set\nour, if I can get back in the screen here\n\n322\n00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.801\ninstead of off in these\ngoofball screens that I'm on.\n\n323\n00:15:49.801 --> 00:15:52.326\nBoy, it does not wanna\nlet me get back in there.\n\n324\n00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:53.326\nSo if we get back in here,\n\n325\n00:15:53.326 --> 00:15:56.830\nyou'll see where we can set those kinda\nthree thresholds and we had that peak.\n\n326\n00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.557\nAnd peak is really what you were\nkind of describing at first.\n\n327\n00:16:00.557 --> 00:16:04.000\nAnd so I'd come in and\ndefine that as that peak.\n\n328\n00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.720\nAnd so that's also why, notice up here,\nwhen I define bandwidth, my average and\n\n329\n00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.430\npeak, it's kilobits per second.\n\n330\n00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.300\nBut notice how the burst\nsize is kilobytes.\n\n331\n00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.910\nThat means I put the wrong\nnumber in earlier.\n\n332\n00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.510\nAnyhow, it's kilobytes,\nit's measured differently.\n\n333\n00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.520\nCuz it's a one time thing.\n\n334\n00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.720\nThere's a one time, here,\nyou need some extra bytes.\n\n335\n00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.600\nWe'll chuck that in and\nhere's what you're gonna get.\n\n336\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.900\nSo definitely be aware\nthere are differences.\n\n337\n00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.130\nProbably the best advice\nI can give you guys for\n\n338\n00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:33.220\noptimizing your network, is read\nthe documentation from your vendor.\n\n339\n00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.740\nVMware vSphere has great documentation\non how to optimize these,\n\n340\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.310\nand what are the optimal settings here?\n\n341\n00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.282\nMicrosoft's Hyper-V, Citrix XenServer,\n\n342\n00:16:40.282 --> 00:16:42.566\nthey've all got documentation\nthat runs over this.\n\n343\n00:16:42.566 --> 00:16:45.180\nSo never forget to check\nthe vendor documentation.\n\n344\n00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.787\nAnd it'll explain all these options,\ncuz they can be misused.\n\n345\n00:16:47.787 --> 00:16:49.113\nAnd if you misconfigure them,\n\n346\n00:16:49.113 --> 00:16:52.420\nit can be worse than just not configure\nthem in the first place, right.\n\n347\n00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.950\nYou can end up where there's bandwidth\nthat you have that you're not using, or\n\n348\n00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.170\nyou can end up where you're constantly\nexceeding the bandwidth you have, and\n\n349\n00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.700\nyou're getting massive\nretransmits on your network.\n\n350\n00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.150\nAnd that can lead to higher\nCPU utilization on your VMs,\n\n351\n00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.060\nwhich means you're wasting resources.\n\n352\n00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.390\nEither way, you're wasting resources.\n\n353\n00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.880\nAll right, so those are some of the things\nwe need to be aware of when it comes\n\n354\n00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.270\nto optimizing our network.\n\n355\n00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.920\nSome of the other options you\nmight see that I didn't see here,\n\n356\n00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.720\nyou might have things like caching.\n\n357\n00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.710\nWhere your server might have some\ndedicated memory set aside to be able to\n\n358\n00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.500\ncache some of the traffic\nthat's passing through.\n\n359\n00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.870\nSo when we're doing traffic shaping or\n\n360\n00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.830\nwhatever, you might see buffering,\nyou might see compression.\n\n361\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.040\nThere's some, especially on Citrix sites,\nCitrix XenServer, they've built\n\n362\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.190\ncompression into a lot of there, so that\nif you're replicating data between centers\n\n363\n00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.320\nit all gets compressed over the network,\nand so it takes less space.\n\n364\n00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.988\nThose are options there,\nyou might even have external\n\n365\n00:17:43.988 --> 00:17:48.166\ndevices like Riverbed SteelHead appliances\nthat will optimize your communications\n\n366\n00:17:48.166 --> 00:17:52.012\nover WAN connectivity by, they look for\nanytime there's a duplicate block.\n\n367\n00:17:52.012 --> 00:17:56.190\nAnd they just transmit it one time and on\nthe other side you have another SteelHead.\n\n368\n00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.320\nAnd it'll see that it should be\nduplicated, and it'll just clone it.\n\n369\n00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.800\nAnd that way you're not actually\ncommunicating it over the line.\n\n370\n00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.160\nThere's all sorts of other solutions that\nare out there like that to optimize your\n\n371\n00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.350\nWAN connections, but\n\n372\n00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.800\nit's almost always the WAN\nconnectivity that we're focused on.\n\n373\n00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.920\nYeah, I don't think I have any\nof the other options in here.\n\n374\n00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.470\nLet's see.\n\n375\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.787\nYeah, yeah, not really anything\ncrazy jumping out at me, but\n\n376\n00:18:15.787 --> 00:18:18.991\nit just depends on your platform\nwhat you may or may not have.\n\n377\n00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:21.520\nAll right, so\nthat's kind of a rundown on that.\n\n378\n00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.740\nNow I showed you guys traffic shaping.\n\n379\n00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.820\nBe aware that that's a part\nof quality of service, QOS.\n\n380\n00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.710\nAnd so on the exam, you may see either\nterm but quality of service is kind of\n\n381\n00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.480\nthat umbrella term that wraps\nup a lot of these technologies.\n\n382\n00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.230\nWe talked about load balancing\nin the last episode.\n\n383\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.960\nAnd then one other thing that CompTIA\nspecifically calls out of the objectives\n\n384\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.110\nis remember,\nyou don't always need this stuff.\n\n385\n00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.390\nIf you want the best\nconnectivity possible,\n\n386\n00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.500\nthe lowest latency possible,\nput all your systems in the same subnet.\n\n387\n00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.250\nPut them where they can communicate to\neach other without going through a router\n\n388\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.490\nor without them going through a firewall.\n\n389\n00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:51.860\nThey're just talking\ndirectly to each other.\n\n390\n00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.300\nAnd then you're gonna get\nthe lowest latency possible.\n\n391\n00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.250\nAnd if you've got replicated clusters, you\ngenerally want them on the same network so\n\n392\n00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:58.870\nthey can talk and\n\n393\n00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.970\nreplicate right between each other, and\nyou get the best connectivity possible.\n\n394\n00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:06.260\n>> Now, you've talked about some of\nthe things that we can use, or I guess we\n\n395\n00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.080\nshould say, some of the techniques\nwe can use to optimize the network.\n\n396\n00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.647\nNow, once we've put these in place,\nsay we've got load balancing,\n\n397\n00:19:12.647 --> 00:19:14.411\nwe've got cluster replication.\n\n398\n00:19:14.411 --> 00:19:18.058\nNow is there, other than some of the third\nparty tools that you've mentioned,\n\n399\n00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:19.920\nis there a way that we can troubleshoot?\n\n400\n00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.430\nShould problems arise,\nshould we have to find out,\n\n401\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.570\nwell maybe the load\nbalancing's not working.\n\n402\n00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.450\nMaybe we do a baseline on one machine and\n\n403\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.740\nwe see that one machine isn't\nreally performing adequately.\n\n404\n00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.880\nAre there some things that\nwe can use inside of,\n\n405\n00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.050\nmaybe our operating systems to\nhelp identify these problems?\n\n406\n00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.010\nYeah, absolutely, remember all\nthese virtualization platforms,\n\n407\n00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.670\nthe, well, type two hypervisors,\nobviously they run on top of a regular OS.\n\n408\n00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:47.280\nSo you've got all your OS tools, but even\ntype one hypervisors still have a host OS.\n\n409\n00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.920\nThe type one hypervisor runs below the\nhost OS, but the host OS is still there.\n\n410\n00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.910\nSo in VMWare, it's Linux under the hood.\n\n411\n00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.968\nIn Citrix XenServer, it's under the hood.\n\n412\n00:19:56.968 --> 00:19:59.510\nIn Microsoft Hyper-V it's\nWindows under the hood, and so\n\n413\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.180\nif you jump into the host OS you got all\nyour traditional trouble shooting tools\n\n414\n00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.970\nand CompTIA wants you to\nbe familiar with those.\n\n415\n00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.550\nIf you've watched our network plus series\nyou're already familiar with them.\n\n416\n00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.920\nBut, let's just do a quick run\nthrough of some of those tools and\n\n417\n00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.610\nget a chance to see what they are.\n\n418\n00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.950\nThe most common tool that\nI make use of is ping.\n\n419\n00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.570\nIf you're not familiar with ping then\nyou've never worked on a network.\n\n420\n00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.710\nIt's just a simple way to see\nif another host is alive.\n\n421\n00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.849\nSo you can say ping followed by and\nIP address and\n\n422\n00:20:22.849 --> 00:20:27.028\nyou can use this to test WAN connectivity,\nyou can use this to lest LAN connectivity.\n\n423\n00:20:27.028 --> 00:20:30.140\nIt's pretty straightforward, but\nthe key thing you want to watch for\n\n424\n00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:36.820\nwhen you're using ping is that you\na time to live and a round trip time.\n\n425\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:41.400\nThe time to live Is a good indicator of\nhow many devices you had to pass through\n\n426\n00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.280\non your way there.\n\n427\n00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.980\nSo for example,\nmy system has a time to live of 64.\n\n428\n00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.842\nBut when I set the pings,\nthey came back with a time to live of 56.\n\n429\n00:20:49.842 --> 00:20:53.846\nSo that tells me that there were eight\ndevices in between me and my destination,\n\n430\n00:20:53.846 --> 00:20:55.910\nso I kind of measure that out.\n\n431\n00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.520\nAnd then my time, I seen that I'm\naveraging 21 to 22 milliseconds.\n\n432\n00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.710\nThat's actually a long time but\nit's cuz I'm going over the Internet.\n\n433\n00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:07.630\nIf I were to pick a local resource like\na switch here on the network, all right.\n\n434\n00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.109\nNotice that my time to live is 64, right?\n\n435\n00:21:11.109 --> 00:21:12.840\nBecause the device is right\nhere on the network with me.\n\n436\n00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.000\nI didn't have to pass through\nany devices to get to it.\n\n437\n00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.140\nAnd then my time, 0.3 milliseconds, right.\n\n438\n00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.770\nSo, not even one millisecond.\n\n439\n00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.910\nThis was a very, very fast,\nvery quick connection.\n\n440\n00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.760\nSo, ping is a great way just to quickly\nmeasure that performance on the network.\n\n441\n00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.910\nAnd see how things are going in\ntest connectivity, all right.\n\n442\n00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.590\nIt's certainly not the only tool for\nthat though, we've got several others.\n\n443\n00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.810\nLet's run through those too.\n\n444\n00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.290\nSo, for example, traceroute, right.\n\n445\n00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.500\nOn Windows it's tracert.\n\n446\n00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:47.360\nOn Linux or UNIX, MacOS, any of the other\nguys, it's traceroute like this.\n\n447\n00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.070\nBut the command works the same.\n\n448\n00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.600\nYou trace your path to get to somewhere.\n\n449\n00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.650\nAnd the neat part about it is, when I did\na traceroute to 4.2.2.1 a minute ago,\n\n450\n00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.210\nI was able to look at the time to live and\n\n451\n00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:59.700\nfigure out how many devices\nI've passed through.\n\n452\n00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.115\nBut when I do a traceroute,\n\n453\n00:22:01.115 --> 00:22:04.660\nit'll actually show me the devices\nthat we've passed through and so\n\n454\n00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.093\nI can start to see them here and\nI kind of expect to see the same A.\n\n455\n00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:11.789\nAnd the cool part here is it shows me\nthe latency on each hop along the way,\n\n456\n00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:13.983\nit looks like I hit\na firewall right there.\n\n457\n00:22:13.983 --> 00:22:19.257\nBut I can see where I had 0.25\nmilliseconds of latency here,\n\n458\n00:22:19.257 --> 00:22:21.991\nor 1.538 right here, and so\n\n459\n00:22:21.991 --> 00:22:27.340\nI can start to identify where my\nbiggest latency is coming from.\n\n460\n00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.620\nRight, again, troubleshooting that\nperformance in the network and\n\n461\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.910\nseeing where things start\nto kinda break down.\n\n462\n00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:33.810\n>> And it looks like you get\na really good map there too.\n\n463\n00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.860\nSo the first couple you can se\nthat that's on our local ISP and\n\n464\n00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.970\nthen by the time it gets down to\nsome of them lower hops there,\n\n465\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.670\nwe're on an Internet backbone provider,\nyou can see Level 3.\n\n466\n00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.140\nSo you can find out at what\npoint along that path,\n\n467\n00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.280\nit's being delayed, I should say.\n\n468\n00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.110\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\n\n469\n00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:54.090\nit's important information to know, find\nout where the weakness is in your network.\n\n470\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:59.290\nWe've got other tools like telnet, telnet\nis for opening up a shell connection\n\n471\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.620\nto a switch or router, your virtualization\nplatform sometimes will support telnet.\n\n472\n00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.917\nIt's not really used anymore,\nbecause it's unsecure.\n\n473\n00:23:07.917 --> 00:23:10.470\nIt transmits everything in plain text,\nso you don't want to send a username and\n\n474\n00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:11.540\npassword over it.\n\n475\n00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.250\nBut if you're setting\nup a virtual machine,\n\n476\n00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.390\nand it's supposed to be sending email,\nand the emails aren't getting through,\n\n477\n00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.260\nit could be that you have a firewall\nin between you and the destination.\n\n478\n00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:25.460\nAnd so you could use telnet to point it\nto a mail server and specify port 25.\n\n479\n00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.980\nAnd now you could connect on\nport 25 to that mail server and\n\n480\n00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.600\nsee whether you’re able to get through.\n\n481\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.680\nSo by being able to specify that other\nport number, we’re not using it for telnet\n\n482\n00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.170\nanymore, but we are using it to be able\nto see if these connections are alive and\n\n483\n00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.970\nout there and\nif there’s a firewall blocking us.\n\n484\n00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.060\nJust kind of a way to check that out.\n\n485\n00:23:41.605 --> 00:23:44.435\nNetstat, I know I used\nnetstat in a show earlier.\n\n486\n00:23:44.435 --> 00:23:48.413\nNetstat is a great way to see what\nconnections are open on my system.\n\n487\n00:23:48.413 --> 00:23:52.450\nIf I'm supposed to be a web server,\nam I listening on my web ports?\n\n488\n00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.284\nWhat connections have I made out there?\n\n489\n00:23:54.284 --> 00:23:56.963\nThe only negative about netstat\nis if you run it by itself,\n\n490\n00:23:56.963 --> 00:23:58.810\nit can give you a lot of information.\n\n491\n00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:02.000\nAnd it's doing these reverse DNS\nlookups that take a little while.\n\n492\n00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.950\nAnd so I normally add a few\nextra commands to netstat.\n\n493\n00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.770\nI normally run netstat -an.\n\n494\n00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:12.160\nAnd dash a is basically telling it\nto give me all of the connections,\n\n495\n00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.260\nbecause by default you only see\nthe active ones, so by saying all you'll\n\n496\n00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.160\neven see the ones that are sleeping,\nthe ones that are kind of in standby.\n\n497\n00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.000\nAnd those are useful to know.\n\n498\n00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.675\nAnd then N is just telling it,\n\n499\n00:24:20.675 --> 00:24:23.345\ndon't bother with the DNS lookup,\njust give me the straight up IPs.\n\n500\n00:24:23.345 --> 00:24:25.795\nAnd when you run that,\nit runs a lot faster.\n\n501\n00:24:25.795 --> 00:24:26.845\nSee how it's already done?\n\n502\n00:24:26.845 --> 00:24:30.175\nCuz it's not doing those name\nlookups in the background, right.\n\n503\n00:24:30.175 --> 00:24:32.035\nIt's just going out and\ngiving you the raw IPs.\n\n504\n00:24:32.035 --> 00:24:37.185\nBut as you can see by me scrolling here,\nit gave me a lot of information.\n\n505\n00:24:37.185 --> 00:24:40.250\nAnd so\nyou almost always have to filter netstat.\n\n506\n00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:44.925\nOn Windows, they don't give you a great\nway to filter it, so you can run netstat\n\n507\n00:24:44.925 --> 00:24:50.320\n-an and you can pipe it into a file, and\nthen you can edit that file and search it.\n\n508\n00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.670\nThat's kinda how I\nusually do it in Windows.\n\n509\n00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.830\nBut on a Unix based system like VMware or\nXenServer, you can just pipe it into\n\n510\n00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:01.200\nthe grep command, and specify whatever\nit is that you're looking for, right?\n\n511\n00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.750\nSo let's say that\n\n512\n00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.830\nI wanna see if I have any connections\nopen to the ITProTV website.\n\n513\n00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:15.060\nI can run netstat -an, and I could grep\nlooking for the IP address of that system.\n\n514\n00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.790\nSo I'm just gonna type it in here,\nout of habit, I'm doing the wrong IP.\n\n515\n00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.180\nAnd so I can punch that IP in, and\n\n516\n00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.568\nnow it's gonna show me if I\nhave any active connections.\n\n517\n00:25:23.568 --> 00:25:28.260\nAnd I could see I do have one right\nhere on port 443, which is SSL.\n\n518\n00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.450\nSo I've got a secure\nweb connection open and\n\n519\n00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.970\nnow I can find exactly\nwhat I'm looking for.\n\n520\n00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.220\nAnd I used that in one of the earlier\nepisodes, I don't remember what I was\n\n521\n00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.220\ndoing, but that's basically\nthe way that command works.\n\n522\n00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.855\nI'm sure it was profound.\n\n523\n00:25:40.855 --> 00:25:42.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n524\n00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:42.800\nDNS, right?\n\n525\n00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.240\nWe may need to check whether DNS is\nworking in Linux and Windows and Mac OS.\n\n526\n00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.510\nThere's a couple of different\ncommands we can use.\n\n527\n00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.850\nThe one that works pretty\nmuch everywhere is nslookup.\n\n528\n00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.500\nNslookup is a name server lookup.\n\n529\n00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.610\nSo am I able to perform DNS lookups?\n\n530\n00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:59.570\nAnd I can look for\nsomething like google.com.\n\n531\n00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:01.550\nAnd there I get my responses for Google.\n\n532\n00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:05.080\nOr I just did it a minute ago for\nitpro.tv right.\n\n533\n00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.620\nNow be careful with one thing.\n\n534\n00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.690\nI know a lot of people out\nthere well I just use ping,\n\n535\n00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:12.700\ncuz if I ping itpro.tv it's\ngonna show me the IP, right.\n\n536\n00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.950\nHere's the thing,\n\n537\n00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:19.030\nmost operating systems have what's called\na hosts' file that let's you override DNS.\n\n538\n00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.331\nIf you use the ping command,\nit'll obey that host file, and\n\n539\n00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:24.478\nthat might be overriding your result.\n\n540\n00:26:24.478 --> 00:26:27.286\nIf you use nslookup,\nit ignores the host file and\n\n541\n00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:30.176\nit does the lookup against\nthe actual DNS server.\n\n542\n00:26:30.176 --> 00:26:32.708\nSo there's a little bit of\na difference between the two,\n\n543\n00:26:32.708 --> 00:26:36.344\nif you use ping, it will honor the host\nfile, if you use nslookup, it won't, and\n\n544\n00:26:36.344 --> 00:26:38.193\nthat's useful in troubleshooting too,\n\n545\n00:26:38.193 --> 00:26:41.312\nin case you think maybe something's\nbeen re-mapped in a host file.\n\n546\n00:26:41.312 --> 00:26:45.990\nNow, Nnslookup works on all the systems.\n\n547\n00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.690\nOn UNIX systems, though, there is\nan older command called dig, and so\n\n548\n00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.810\nI can dig a domain and it gives you\nthe same basic information, but\n\n549\n00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.580\nit does give you a little bit extra.\n\n550\n00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.580\nSo there's my IP right there, but\nit gives me the true A record.\n\n551\n00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.440\nSo I can see things like the time to live,\n\n552\n00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.970\nthat's not on this one, and I can see\nsome other information about that zone.\n\n553\n00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.689\nSo the dig command just gives you\na little bit more information.\n\n554\n00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.800\nAll right, who's next on our list?\n\n555\n00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.570\nOur IP configuration.\n\n556\n00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.820\nIf I've got management ports on\nmy virtualization host or even\n\n557\n00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:22.100\nthe configuration of my virtual machines,\nright, we might have to set ip addresses.\n\n558\n00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.860\nIn the Windows world you\nhave the ip config command,\n\n559\n00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.840\nwhich is not present in the Unix world.\n\n560\n00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.600\nI say it, but then it worked, didn't it?\n\n561\n00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.910\nWell, anyhow,\nlet me jump over to a Windows box and\n\n562\n00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:33.690\nI'll show you here on a Windows machine.\n\n563\n00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.930\nIf I run ipconfig,\nit's gonna show me my network adapters and\n\n564\n00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.470\ntheir default gateway and\ntheir subnet mask.\n\n565\n00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:41.190\nWe talked about that back in\nthe network concepts episode.\n\n566\n00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.762\nBut if you're on a Unix machine,\nyou may not have that.\n\n567\n00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:48.367\nOn a Unix machine, the command that\nwe normally run here is ifconfig, or\n\n568\n00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:52.217\ninterface config,\nkind of like ipconfig but ifconfig, and\n\n569\n00:27:52.217 --> 00:27:55.935\nit'll show you all your adapters and\ntheir IP addresses.\n\n570\n00:27:55.935 --> 00:27:57.793\nYou don't get as much data, though,\n\n571\n00:27:57.793 --> 00:28:00.240\nI don't get the subnet\nmasks that are being used.\n\n572\n00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.570\nSo I might have to dig through\nmy configs to find those, but\n\n573\n00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:05.340\nit's kind of an alternative\nto that command, all right.\n\n574\n00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.470\nOn some newer Linux systems,\nyou might not have IF config.\n\n575\n00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.880\nYou do on VMWare ESX and\nCitrix Zen server, they've got it.\n\n576\n00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.230\nBut if you're building up\nyour own KVM host, and\n\n577\n00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.720\nyou run on the newer versions of CentOS,\nthey don't have ifconfig anymore.\n\n578\n00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.040\nSo you might need to use\nthe ip addr command.\n\n579\n00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.084\nAnd you'll see,\nI don't have it on this system, but\n\n580\n00:28:25.084 --> 00:28:29.501\nthat'll show your IP addressing also,\nit's kind of another way to view it.\n\n581\n00:28:29.501 --> 00:28:30.290\nLet's see, route.\n\n582\n00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:33.207\nI mentioned routing tables in the last\nepisode, if we have VLANs and\n\n583\n00:28:33.207 --> 00:28:36.398\ndifferent networks that are out there,\nwe need to know how to get to them.\n\n584\n00:28:36.398 --> 00:28:38.525\nWell, if you've got a router\nthat takes care of it, but\n\n585\n00:28:38.525 --> 00:28:41.424\nif you don't have a router you can\nactually use your own machine as a router,\n\n586\n00:28:41.424 --> 00:28:44.480\nor you can even put static routes and\nyou do it with the route command.\n\n587\n00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.920\nThe route command is present in Windows,\nas well as Linux and\n\n588\n00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.580\nUnix, so you've got it.\n\n589\n00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:53.690\nAnd basically you can just come in and\nspecify different routes that\n\n590\n00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:58.760\nyou want to put in and, they don't\ngive me any examples here, do they?\n\n591\n00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.600\n>> Kind of like in Windows if you\nwant to see the routing table,\n\n592\n00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.580\nyou can just do a route print command,\nand it just outputs the route command.\n\n593\n00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.220\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or you could do a route print dash\n\n594\n00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.550\nfour, I think, and\nit just shows you the IPv4 information so\n\n595\n00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.620\nyou can filter it even more there.\n\n596\n00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.230\n>> Yeah, absolutely, so you he's talking\nabout the route print command So\n\n597\n00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.050\nyou can see that routing table and\nthe different things that are listed.\n\n598\n00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.750\nAnd so there's all the IPs that we know\nabout and the links that we get to them.\n\n599\n00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.745\nUnix is the same way.\n\n600\n00:29:22.745 --> 00:29:25.728\nIn fact, I think it is what is a route- a.\n\n601\n00:29:25.728 --> 00:29:28.445\nIt's something.\n\n602\n00:29:28.445 --> 00:29:30.861\nYou run route something.\n\n603\n00:29:30.861 --> 00:29:33.760\n[LAUGH] It'll display the routing table,\nso you can add routes and\n\n604\n00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.010\nstuff to it too if you\nneed to manipulate that.\n\n605\n00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.960\n>> Typically, we don't need to\nthough because you actually have\n\n606\n00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.330\nrouters that are doing that job and not\nnecessarily your virtualization platform.\n\n607\n00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.900\nAnother one that I use a lot is arp.\n\n608\n00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.290\nArp is incredibly useful,\nespecially when you have bonded NICs.\n\n609\n00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.730\nIf we've got multiple network adapters\nbonded together like we saw in the last\n\n610\n00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.190\nepisode, well, we need to make sure\nthat they're actually functioning.\n\n611\n00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.250\nAnd a quick arp -a is\na great way to see that.\n\n612\n00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:01.230\nArp -a shows all the IP\naddresses you've learned and\n\n613\n00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.930\ntheir corresponding Mac addresses.\n\n614\n00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.810\nSo what Mac address has\nbeen tied to what IP, and\n\n615\n00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.560\nmore importantly,\nwhat adapter they were learned on.\n\n616\n00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.890\nSee how I've got some learned on en0,\nand some on en4, right?\n\n617\n00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:17.230\nSo some were learned on my Ethernet\nadapter 0, some on Ethernet adapter 4,\n\n618\n00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.870\nthat's how I know both\nadapters are working.\n\n619\n00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:23.130\nIf I think that I'm load balancing\nacross NICs and I check my ARP table and\n\n620\n00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:27.120\nI only see entries on one adapter,\nthen I'm not load balancing.\n\n621\n00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.090\nNow I might be in a active/passive\nfailover type configuration, or\n\n622\n00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.000\nthe other one might just\nnot be working at all and\n\n623\n00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.710\neverything's having to\ndefault to one adapter.\n\n624\n00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:39.060\nJust be careful that you check this\nfrom the host, because in a VM,\n\n625\n00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.110\nit's only gonna see its one adapter, the\nvirtual machine sees its virtual adapter,\n\n626\n00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:45.370\nit only sees that and\nthe ARP data isn't as useful there.\n\n627\n00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:50.580\nBut if your virtual machine is put on a\nVLAN and it's not able to talk to anybody,\n\n628\n00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:56.200\nyou can use ARP just to see if you're even\ngetting Mac addresses back and so forth.\n\n629\n00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.540\nIf you have a firewall in place,\n\n630\n00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.110\neven a firewall's going to allow\nthe ARP broadcast to happen,\n\n631\n00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:03.380\nthat way you can find the host to talk to,\nand then it'll filter you based on that.\n\n632\n00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.198\nSo I might have a ping to\nsomebody that's failing, right?\n\n633\n00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:10.230\nSo I might try and ping 10.1.230.209.\n\n634\n00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.517\nShoot.\nI had to pick one that was\n\n635\n00:31:11.517 --> 00:31:12.710\nactually present.\n\n636\n00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.940\nI was trying to pick an IP that\nwasn't in use on our network.\n\n637\n00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.035\nThere we go.\nSo I'm trying to ping 10.1.230.244.\n\n638\n00:31:20.035 --> 00:31:22.463\nNow, I'm not getting a response back, so\n\n639\n00:31:22.463 --> 00:31:26.000\nthat machine obviously doesn't exist,\nright?\n\n640\n00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.350\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n641\n00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:31.750\nIf it's a modern machine,\na lot of them block pings by default.\n\n642\n00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.237\nI might be getting blocked.\n\n643\n00:31:33.237 --> 00:31:38.939\nBut if I do an arp -a, and\nI look for 10.1.230.244,\n\n644\n00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:42.787\nI might find a Mac address for\nthat machine.\n\n645\n00:31:42.787 --> 00:31:46.733\nAnd if I do, that means there is a machine\nthere, but a firewall blocked me and\n\n646\n00:31:46.733 --> 00:31:48.696\nthat's why I wasn't able to ping it.\n\n647\n00:31:48.696 --> 00:31:51.531\nSo ARP is a great way to find out\nwhether there's a firewall in place, and\n\n648\n00:31:51.531 --> 00:31:53.077\nwhether that's what your problem is.\n\n649\n00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:56.982\nBut in this scenario, I can see I didn't,\nI've got an incomplete here.\n\n650\n00:31:56.982 --> 00:32:00.413\nWhich tells me that I didn't\nget a MAC address and\n\n651\n00:32:00.413 --> 00:32:03.520\nthis machine effectively doesn't exist.\n\n652\n00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.231\nAll right.\n\n653\n00:32:04.231 --> 00:32:05.960\nLast two things that I wanna mention.\n\n654\n00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.290\nThese are ones that CompTIA calls\nout that are pretty important.\n\n655\n00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.350\nIf you're not finding what\nyou want with your commands,\n\n656\n00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:16.640\nif the network just isn't working,\nalways remember to check your system logs.\n\n657\n00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.010\nIn Windows,\nyou have the event viewer, right?\n\n658\n00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.940\nSo in Windows,\nif you go into your server manager and\n\n659\n00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.440\ngo under Tools,\nyou've got a tool called the event viewer.\n\n660\n00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.490\nAnd Hyper-V has its own logs that it\nkeeps, so that you can jump in there and\n\n661\n00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.070\nfind out whether everything's working\nproperly or if things are acting up, or\n\n662\n00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:37.750\nwhatever, so you can jump in and\ncheck your system logs and so on.\n\n663\n00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:42.510\nAnd you can even drill down and find your\nHyper-V logs buried in here somewhere.\n\n664\n00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.470\nLet me find them.\n\n665\n00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.970\nHere we go.\n\n666\n00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.767\nSo you'll see all these different\nHyper-V logs right here.\n\n667\n00:32:46.767 --> 00:32:51.990\nHyper-V -Config, EmulatedNic, Hypervisor,\nIntegration, and you can look\n\n668\n00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:55.360\nat the log files to see if there's any\nerrors or other things entered in there.\n\n669\n00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.090\nDefinitely something that you want to\ncheck out to make sure that all this\n\n670\n00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:00.680\nstuff is working properly, right?\n\n671\n00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.640\nIn the UNIX world, so if you're running\nVMWare ESX or Citrix XenServer KVM,\n\n672\n00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.420\nwhat you're gonna want to\nlook at are your syslogs.\n\n673\n00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:14.430\nAnd those are stored in, well,\nnormally they're in /var/logs.\n\n674\n00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:18.940\nFirst, sorry, no s, /var/log and you'll\nsee a file in there called messages and\n\n675\n00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.390\nthat's normally where it is.\n\n676\n00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:26.230\nI'm on a Mac here so it's not exactly\nthe same, I don't have a messages file but\n\n677\n00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:29.330\nyou see my system logs right there\nthat are kind of popping by and\n\n678\n00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.300\nthat's cause Mac's have their\nown little log monitor.\n\n679\n00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:38.080\nBut on a UNIX machine,\nyou'll normally have /var/log/messages.\n\n680\n00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.260\nAnd you can look in that file and\n\n681\n00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.450\nif there's any errors or things going on,\nthat's a great place to find it.\n\n682\n00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:47.660\nBut probably the best troubleshooting tool\nyou'll have is the vendor documentation.\n\n683\n00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.830\nRemember that there's great\ndocumentation available for\n\n684\n00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.230\nall the various products\nthat are out there.\n\n685\n00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.470\nBut maybe not so much KVM.\n\n686\n00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:55.290\nBut the other ones,\nthere's great documentation for.\n\n687\n00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:57.720\nDefinitely read up on it cuz a lot\nof the stuff that's going wrong,\n\n688\n00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.520\nproblems that you might be having,\nthat may already be answered for\n\n689\n00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.800\nyou in a document and all you had to do\nwas look at it and find that information.\n\n690\n00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.260\n>> A lot of good information on that one,\n\n691\n00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.500\nspeaking of which, and\nwe've talked about a lot of different\n\n692\n00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.430\nconcepts here in this episode\n>> We've talked about the different types\n\n693\n00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:15.820\nof networks and you know,\ntalked about how they, you know,\n\n694\n00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:20.340\na WAN, what WAN means for you,\nthe CAN, not the CAN, the LAN,\n\n695\n00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.540\nthe man,\nCAN will be in another episode, right?\n\n696\n00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.050\nWe've talked about bandwidth,\nthings like clustering and\n\n697\n00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:28.690\nsome of the things you can do\nto help you with compression and\n\n698\n00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.710\ncaching\n>> We've also looked at a bunch of tools,\n\n699\n00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.790\na whole bunch of tools that\nCompTIA calls out on the exam, so\n\n700\n00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:35.800\ndefinitely check them out.\n\n701\n00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.910\nDon, you have anything else for\nus in this episode?\n\n702\n00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.480\n>> That's really about it.\n\n703\n00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.310\nJust be aware,\n\n704\n00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.400\ndifferent platforms have different\nfeatures, but we've seen a lot of it.\n\n705\n00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.040\nWe're gonna see more more troubleshooting\ndown the road as we continue on with\n\n706\n00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:45.715\nCloud+.\n\n707\n00:34:45.715 --> 00:34:47.765\nBut for right now, these are the tools\nthat we need to be familiar with and\n\n708\n00:34:47.765 --> 00:34:49.195\nthe techniques for the exam.\n\n709\n00:34:49.195 --> 00:34:52.465\n>> All right, well, that sounds like\na good place to wrap up this episode.\n\n710\n00:34:52.465 --> 00:34:54.775\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n711\n00:34:54.775 --> 00:34:56.625\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n712\n00:34:56.625 --> 00:34:57.405\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n713\n00:34:57.405 --> 00:35:01.347\n>> And we'll

00:00:15.743\nI'm your host Wes Brian and\n\n4\n00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:18.851\nin today's episode we're gonna\nbe moving along in Cloud Plus.\n\n5\n00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:22.956\nAnd more specifically what we're gonna be\ntalking about Is monitoring resources in\n\n6\n00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:23.544\nthe Cloud.\n\n7\n00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:26.340\nAnd we have on tap for\nyou today Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.700\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.220\n>> I'm doing great Wes, ready to jump\nright back into the world of Cloud plus.\n\n10\n00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.260\nAnd in this episode we're gonna to\ntalk about monitoring resources,\n\n11\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260\nwhich is really important.\n\n12\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.190\nWhen you've got dedicated servers,\n\n13\n00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.010\nyou have one role being\nperformed on one server.\n\n14\n00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.080\nThey have full access to resources.\n\n15\n00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.506\nBut when we start going into\nvirtualized environments,\n\n16\n00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:48.901\nyou might have many virtual machines\nrunning from the same physical hardware.\n\n17\n00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:51.522\nAnd they all start to compete for\nresources.\n\n18\n00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:55.586\nYou have a lot of contention for access.\n\n19\n00:00:55.586 --> 00:00:58.085\nSo we need a way to monitor that,\nto keep an eye on it.\n\n20\n00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:00.074\nAnd make sure our network's running happy,\nhealthy, and\n\n21\n00:01:00.074 --> 00:01:02.310\neverything's running the way\nthat it needs to be.\n\n22\n00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.770\nOr, at a minimum,\nwe know when it's time to upgrade.\n\n23\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.570\nWe know when there's a resource\nthat we're running out of and\n\n24\n00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.070\nwe need to add more to\nkind of compensate for it.\n\n25\n00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.698\nMonitoring is really important\nin a virtualized environment.\n\n26\n00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:14.156\nSo that's what we're gonna be taking\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n27\n00:01:14.156 --> 00:01:16.290\n>> Now, when it comes to monitoring,\n\n28\n00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.930\nthere's different criteria\nthat we need to monitor, Don.\n\n29\n00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.971\nAnd this is wrapped up\ninto a concept of metrics.\n\n30\n00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:26.220\nSo, I believe you have a ton of different\ntypes of metrics and those parameters and\n\n31\n00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.879\ncharacteristics that\nwe're looking to monitor.\n\n32\n00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:30.950\nSo, you tell us a little bit about those?\n\n33\n00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.720\n>> All right, so let's say that you're\nhosting up on Amazon's Web Services,\n\n34\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.380\nAWS, or you're hosting on Microsoft Azure\nor Rack Space, or Google Computer,\n\n35\n00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.640\nwhoever it is that you're using.\n\n36\n00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.880\nWith those guys, we don't normally worry\nso much about CPU and memory and so on.\n\n37\n00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.990\nWhen you spin up a VN, you pick how\nmuch memory you want it to have.\n\n38\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.990\nBut the underlying virtualization host,\nyou never see it, so you don't care.\n\n39\n00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.550\nBecause Google, or Microsoft, or whoever,\n\n40\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.430\nis managing that server under the hood,\nright?\n\n41\n00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.814\nThe only metric we really care about when\nwe're hosting up in the cloud like that,\n\n42\n00:02:01.814 --> 00:02:02.871\nis up time, right?\n\n43\n00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:04.009\nWhat is our up time?\n\n44\n00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.790\nAnd almost all these vendors will have\na service level agreement an SLA,\n\n45\n00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.691\nthat says like Microsoft's is 99.98%,\nactually 99.49%.\n\n46\n00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:16.664\n>> Four nine's, yes.\n\n47\n00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:21.214\n>> It's not five 9s it's a little\nbit lower and what it amounts to is\n\n48\n00:02:21.214 --> 00:02:26.120\nI believe it's something like 40\nminutes of downtime per month.\n\n49\n00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.280\nOr I think it's 20 minutes\nof downtime per month.\n\n50\n00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.620\nSo they're guaranteeing you an uptime of\na certain level and are you getting it?\n\n51\n00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.030\nWell you need to monitor it,\nyou need a way to watch and see.\n\n52\n00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.220\nAre my systems actually up?\n\n53\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.010\nHave they gone down and\nMicrosoft just didn't alert me.\n\n54\n00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.820\nI need to know.\n\n55\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.350\nI'm relying on these other people to\nhost my systems and keep them online and\n\n56\n00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.240\nkeep them healthy.\n\n57\n00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.120\nSo, uptime is a really important metric.\n\n58\n00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.430\nIt's important for\nyour own local network servers, too.\n\n59\n00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.273\nBut when they're out in the Cloud like\nthat it's really the only metric that we\n\n60\n00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:53.973\ntruly care about.\n\n61\n00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:56.994\nYou'll probably monitor performance\ninside of the VMS just to make sure they\n\n62\n00:02:56.994 --> 00:02:58.560\nare performing properly.\n\n63\n00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.110\nI might have spec'd a server,\na VM with 4 gigs of RAM originally.\n\n64\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.520\nAnd now, I'm running out of the 4 gigs,\nI need to bump up to 8 gigs.\n\n65\n00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.670\nI need to watch for that stuff.\n\n66\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.210\nBut the virtual machine host,\nunderneath it, is fine.\n\n67\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.680\nIt's got the resources for\nthat and it's being managed.\n\n68\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.675\nSo, up time is what we care about.\n\n69\n00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:16.240\nFor everything else though, right,\n\n70\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.200\nespecially if you got\na local private cloud.\n\n71\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.480\nIf you built up your own\ncloud infrastructure.\n\n72\n00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.270\nThen you've got the good\nold fashion big four of\n\n73\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.130\nperformance that we need to watch, right?\n\n74\n00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.020\nAnd if you watch any of our shows,\n\n75\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.080\nyou've heard this before but\nCPU, memory, disk, network.\n\n76\n00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.100\nThose are the big four, the four main\nresources that any system can run out of,\n\n77\n00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.490\nand then you resolve the slowness, right.\n\n78\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.130\nSo let's talk about each\none just kinda briefly.\n\n79\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.710\nCPU, on CPU what we're normally\nconcerned about is CPU utilization.\n\n80\n00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.440\nNow, if you're monitoring it from\ninside of a VM, what do you see?\n\n81\n00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.280\nYou see the CPU utilization for\nits virtual CPUs.\n\n82\n00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.660\nAnd that's not really worth anything.\n\n83\n00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.260\nIt really doesn't help you much at all.\n\n84\n00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.870\nIt helps you know if that one VM is\nundersized, but that's about it.\n\n85\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.002\nOn your host though, that's where\nyou can see the CPU utilization for\n\n86\n00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:03.822\nall the VMs that are running on top of it.\n\n87\n00:04:03.822 --> 00:04:05.910\nAnd you can see if you're over saturated.\n\n88\n00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.620\nRemember that on a server,\nyou might have one or more physical CPUs.\n\n89\n00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.640\nIn those CPUs,\nyou might have one or more cores.\n\n90\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.660\nAnd in those cores,\nyou might have hyperthreading,\n\n91\n00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.960\nthat can effectively double their\nperformance in some scenarios, right.\n\n92\n00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.415\nSo, those are all things that need to be\nmonitored to see if we're running out of\n\n93\n00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:24.157\nresources.\n\n94\n00:04:24.157 --> 00:04:27.650\nIs my physical server\nhosting too many VMs?\n\n95\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.221\nIs my physical server perfectly capable of\nhandling it, I can put more VMs on there?\n\n96\n00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:34.970\nI don't know unless I\nmonitor that CPU utilization.\n\n97\n00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.480\nReally, really important\nto keep an eye on that.\n\n98\n00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.401\nAll right, RAM is the next one.\n\n99\n00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:43.040\nCPU and RAM, those are the two that\nnormally affect our performance.\n\n100\n00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.790\nBut RAM, it's memory.\n\n101\n00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.150\nIt's how much memory those\nvirtual machines have, and\n\n102\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.570\nthe host has to have enough memory,\nto contain all the virtual machines on it.\n\n103\n00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.240\nSo if I have ten VMs with two gigs of RAM\neach, that's 20 gigs, 20 gigs of RAM.\n\n104\n00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.850\nDo I have 20 gigs of RAM\nin my underlying host?\n\n105\n00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.750\nIf I do, I'll be okay.\n\n106\n00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.530\nIf I don't, I'm out of memory I'm gonna\nstart swapping to the hard drive and\n\n107\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.200\nthat's bad.\n\n108\n00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.050\nPerformance really suffers at that point.\n\n109\n00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.981\nSo we need to monitor for that.\n\n110\n00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:09.771\n>> Now one of the things when you talk\nabout the file swapping that seems like\n\n111\n00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:11.797\nthat's not only gonna\neffect the virtual machine.\n\n112\n00:05:11.797 --> 00:05:14.670\nBut that's gonna effect one of the other\nfour horsemen there like your hard\n\n113\n00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.650\ndrive, right?\n\n114\n00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.060\nAny kind of utilization you have in\nyour harder drive is going to, if I can\n\n115\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.050\nsay this right, is going to be effected\nby that limitation in memory, right?\n\n116\n00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.630\n>> Absolutely, and\nI love the way you put that,\n\n117\n00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.300\nI never thought of it\nas the four horse men.\n\n118\n00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.380\n>> Yeah.\n>> Kind of is, right?\n\n119\n00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.988\nYeah [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] If we run out we're in trouble.\n\n120\n00:05:29.988 --> 00:05:33.748\nIf you start swapping your RAM to disk,\nthat's disk I/O, right?\n\n121\n00:05:33.748 --> 00:05:37.321\nAnd you're generating excess disk\nI/O's taking away from whatever your\n\n122\n00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:41.020\nresources are and it kinda leads us\nto that next metric, which is disk.\n\n123\n00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.560\nRemember that, of all the parts that we\nhave on a server, the disk is the slowest.\n\n124\n00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.070\nAnd so, while RAM and CPU are really\nimportant, even if they're curved and\n\n125\n00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.390\nrunning in line.\n\n126\n00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.890\nIf your disk I/O is suffering,\nthen you got a real problem,right?\n\n127\n00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.290\nThen we've got some issues, and\n\n128\n00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.210\nthat's where we're really gonna have\nto get in there and start to innovate.\n\n129\n00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.876\nSo, when we're monitoring on disk,\n\n130\n00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:02.124\nthere's a few things that\nwe want to watch out for.\n\n131\n00:06:02.124 --> 00:06:06.590\nThe first one is just our reads and\nwrites per second.\n\n132\n00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.810\nHow much data am I sending to\nthe drive and getting from the drive?\n\n133\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.884\nAnd, there's different terms that\nyou'll see mentioned for this.\n\n134\n00:06:13.884 --> 00:06:17.990\nWe have our disk I/O,\na lot of people say disk I/O, right?\n\n135\n00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.720\nAnd I/O is input output, if you're\nreading, that's output from the disk.\n\n136\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.503\nIf you're writing,\nthat's input to the disk.\n\n137\n00:06:24.503 --> 00:06:27.207\nBut your counters are normally flipping\naround from the perspective of\n\n138\n00:06:27.207 --> 00:06:28.680\nthe operating system, right.\n\n139\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.830\nSo the operating system, when it does\nan output it's writing to the disk.\n\n140\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.590\nWhen it does an input it's\nreading from the disk.\n\n141\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.210\nIt's important to check your documentation\nto see which terminology your system uses.\n\n142\n00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.110\nBut either way, they're reads and\nwrites, right, it's disk I/O.\n\n143\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.280\nAnd when you have\na dedicated disk just for\n\n144\n00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.410\na single server role, it's no big deal,\nright, they have exclusive access.\n\n145\n00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.740\nBut when you have virtualization\ntechnologies, your VMs might be storing\n\n146\n00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.930\ntheir virtual hard drives on the same SAN\nand competing for the same resources.\n\n147\n00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.290\nAnd so, then we really start\nto have problems, okay?\n\n148\n00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.681\n>> I was just gonna say,\nand it's interesting.\n\n149\n00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:03.099\nYou might say, well, what's the,\nwhy do I care about reads and writes,\n\n150\n00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:06.040\ninstead just looking at the overall\nperformance of the drive.\n\n151\n00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.530\nBut, If it's a DHCP server, right?\n\n152\n00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.538\nWhat type of read or\n\n153\n00:07:10.538 --> 00:07:14.705\nwrite is gonna be a lot different than\nlet's say if it's a SQL server, right?\n\n154\n00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:17.040\nIt's gonna be definitely read intensive.\n\n155\n00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.110\nBut write intensive on that could cause\nthings like corruptions in your databases\n\n156\n00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.320\nversus like the traditional DHCP server.\n\n157\n00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.620\nSo reads and writes, you do have\nto pay attention to both, right?\n\n158\n00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.879\n>> Absolute, absolutely, and\nthere is another term I wanna mention,\n\n159\n00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:29.673\nwhich are IOPS.\n\n160\n00:07:29.673 --> 00:07:32.534\nAnd you'll see this from time to time,\nwhich is I-O-P-S,\n\n161\n00:07:32.534 --> 00:07:35.230\nIOPS are input output\noperations per second.\n\n162\n00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.550\nAnd when you set up a cloud service,\nlike with Amazon, you can see these.\n\n163\n00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.350\nLet me just show you real quick,\nI'm logged into AWS here.\n\n164\n00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.740\nAnd if I jump into create\na virtual machine, so\n\n165\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.490\nI'm gonna whip up a new virtual machine.\n\n166\n00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.170\nI'll launch an instance here,\nI'll just do like a Linux machine.\n\n167\n00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.124\nWhen I go to provision this machine,\nI need to pick my tier.\n\n168\n00:07:53.124 --> 00:07:56.595\nAnd here on my pricing tier what\nI'm picking is how many CPUs and\n\n169\n00:07:56.595 --> 00:07:58.441\nhow much memory I want it to have.\n\n170\n00:07:58.441 --> 00:08:00.461\nSo, let's say I go with an M4 Large.\n\n171\n00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:02.388\nI'm gonna do two CPU's.\n\n172\n00:08:02.388 --> 00:08:06.846\nAnd 8 gigs of RAM, right, so\nthis is a moderate machine, a decent size.\n\n173\n00:08:06.846 --> 00:08:08.640\nAnd, as I move through the configuration,\n\n174\n00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.100\neventually I'll get to storage,\nhere we go.\n\n175\n00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.090\nAnd so, when I'm looking at storage,\nhere's the hard drive,\n\n176\n00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.260\nand it's giving me an 8 gig hard drive,\nand it's General Purpose storage.\n\n177\n00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.600\nAnd then right here I've got my IOPS.\n\n178\n00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:26.370\nMy IOPS are my input/output,\nthat's the I, operations per second.\n\n179\n00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.896\nAnd notice how it says 24 of 3000.\n\n180\n00:08:29.896 --> 00:08:31.420\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n181\n00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.610\nWell, Amazon is capping me at 3000 IOPS,\n\n182\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.200\nthat's the most input/output\noperations I can get per second.\n\n183\n00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.865\nBut, I'm actually only getting 24, right.\n\n184\n00:08:40.865 --> 00:08:42.380\nWhy am I only getting 24?\n\n185\n00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.091\nWell, Amazon charges money for those IOPS.\n\n186\n00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:46.768\nBut they don't have a great\nway to bill for that, so\n\n187\n00:08:46.768 --> 00:08:48.458\nwhat they do is they base it\non the size of the drive.\n\n188\n00:08:48.458 --> 00:08:52.934\nIf I do an 8 gig drive,\nthen they do 8 times 4, or 8 times 3,\n\n189\n00:08:52.934 --> 00:08:54.970\n8 times 3, is that right?\n\n190\n00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:55.574\nYes, 8 times 3.\n\n191\n00:08:55.574 --> 00:08:56.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's simple math.\n\n192\n00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.170\nAnd you get that 24 IOPS,\nthat's what I get.\n\n193\n00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.290\nSo if I want more, like here,\nlet me add a new volume.\n\n194\n00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.070\nSo here's another new volume,\nit's 8 gigs, see how it got 24 IOPS also.\n\n195\n00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:10.893\nIf I bump that up, and let's say I do\n100 gigs, see how I just got 300 IOPS?\n\n196\n00:09:10.893 --> 00:09:12.510\nRight, 100 times 3.\n\n197\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:19.010\nOr if I make it a terabyte in size,\nnow I get my true 3000 IOPS.\n\n198\n00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.200\nNow I can have 3000 IOPS.\n\n199\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.040\nI might not have a terabyte of data,\nI might have 100 megs of data, right?\n\n200\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.490\nBut I need to do a terabyte drive\nto get the full IOPS on that, and\n\n201\n00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.390\nthat's important.\n\n202\n00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.822\nYou need to be monitoring the IOPS\nof your storage cuz you might not be\n\n203\n00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:33.471\ngetting enough.\n\n204\n00:09:33.471 --> 00:09:34.665\nAnd in Amazon at least,\n\n205\n00:09:34.665 --> 00:09:38.420\na way to resolve that is to just\nincrease the size of your drive.\n\n206\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.110\nThey also have a special on,\nlet's see do I get it?\n\n207\n00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.020\nYeah, Provisioned IOPS,\nProvisioned IOPS is really cool.\n\n208\n00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.852\nCuz I might not want that terabyte drive.\n\n209\n00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:47.047\nI might, well that was different.\n\n210\n00:09:47.047 --> 00:09:49.000\nI might not want that terabyte drive.\n\n211\n00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.029\nI might just want a 100 meg drive or\n100 or 1 gig or whatever.\n\n212\n00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:56.735\nMy system is going crazy.\n\n213\n00:09:56.735 --> 00:10:00.740\nSo I might wanna gigantic drive, but with\nProvisioned IOPS I can get a guarantee,\n\n214\n00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.539\nand notice that guarantee\nis a lot higher than 3000.\n\n215\n00:10:03.539 --> 00:10:05.059\nIt's at 2,000 by default.\n\n216\n00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:08.070\nI can get 20000 IOPS in this single disk.\n\n217\n00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.830\nI've gotta pick that, first off,\nwhen I set up the disk.\n\n218\n00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.870\nAnd secondly, I've gotta monitor my system\nto make sure I'm operating within those\n\n219\n00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.720\nboundaries, cuz if I'm not,\nthen data's gonna start queuing up.\n\n220\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.250\nAnd that's another metric worth\nmentioning, is the disk queue length.\n\n221\n00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.210\nThat's how many programs are waiting\nin line to write to the disk.\n\n222\n00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.150\nOr not just programs, how many\nread-write operations are waiting.\n\n223\n00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:32.029\nAnd your disk queue length should ideally\nbe 0, but if it ever grows above that,\n\n224\n00:10:32.029 --> 00:10:35.357\nwell there's a tolerance level\nthat you have to determine, right.\n\n225\n00:10:35.357 --> 00:10:37.200\nHow much can you tolerate being in line?\n\n226\n00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.564\nUsually 1 or 2 is not so bad,\nbut if you've got 8 or 10 or 100,\n\n227\n00:10:40.564 --> 00:10:43.570\nthat's a lot of stuff waiting\nto be written to the disk.\n\n228\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.250\nYou've exceeded the IOPS for your disk.\n\n229\n00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.212\nSo reads per second, writes per second,\n\n230\n00:10:49.212 --> 00:10:52.425\nmaximum IOPS, these are all things that\nwe want to monitor on the disk side.\n\n231\n00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:56.100\n>> Now,\nlooking at this interface here Don,\n\n232\n00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.055\none of the things that I'm thinking of\nright away is that you really have to\n\n233\n00:11:00.055 --> 00:11:04.865\nplan your provisioning for\nthese machines appropriately.\n\n234\n00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:08.465\nAnd I can see where the monitoring would\ncome into play cuz I can only imagine if\n\n235\n00:11:08.465 --> 00:11:09.789\nyou have 20000 IOPS now,\n\n236\n00:11:09.789 --> 00:11:13.355\nyour price probably just went through\nthe roof comparative to the first one.\n\n237\n00:11:13.355 --> 00:11:15.925\nSo the monitoring could also help\n\n238\n00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:21.080\nyou to provision additional machines based\non whatever your future requirements are.\n\n239\n00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.150\n>> Yeah, and\nlet me pull up the pricing on this.\n\n240\n00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.860\nAmazon's really good about\npublishing all their pricing, so\n\n241\n00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.040\nthey don't keep that stuff secret.\n\n242\n00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.165\nBut if you look, General Purpose (SSD),\n\n243\n00:11:30.165 --> 00:11:34.840\nthat's what I was messing with in the\nfirst place, is $0.10 per GB per month.\n\n244\n00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.500\nSo if I have 8 gigs of data it's\ngonna cost me $0.80 per month.\n\n245\n00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.280\nSo we're not talking about a lot of money.\n\n246\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.430\nBut then when you start getting into\nProvisioned IOPS it goes from $0.10 per\n\n247\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:50.696\ngig per month to $0.125\nper gig per month and\n\n248\n00:11:50.696 --> 00:11:57.440\n$0.065 per provisioned IOPS month.\n\n249\n00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.570\nSo it really starts to add up and\nit starts to become expensive but\n\n250\n00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.759\nyou're getting that performance out of it.\n\n251\n00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.190\nThe last metric I wanna\nmention is network.\n\n252\n00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:09.670\nAnd on the network side, it's similar to\nstorage, right, you've got bandwidth.\n\n253\n00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.730\nYou've got, instead of reads and writes,\nyou have bytes in and bytes out.\n\n254\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.570\nAnd so you've got to monitor that.\n\n255\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.590\nHow much data are you sending through?\n\n256\n00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:23.100\nAnd I pulled up the EBS pricing here,\nright, but if I do EC2 pricing,\n\n257\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.430\nyou'll see that even with my EC2,\n\n258\n00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.800\nmy server instances when I bring those up,\nthey still charge for bandwidth.\n\n259\n00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.940\nWell that's what it\ncomes with right there.\n\n260\n00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.650\nWhere's the actual pricing for this?\n\n261\n00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:37.020\nSomewhere in here it'll tell me what\nthe actual bandwidth is, and they charge,\n\n262\n00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.560\nAmazon doesn't charge for data going\ninto AWS, they charge for it going out.\n\n263\n00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.010\nSo when your customers visit your\nwebsite and load your webpage,\n\n264\n00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.210\nthat's what you're paying for.\n\n265\n00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:48.480\nAnd so somewhere in here they've got that.\n\n266\n00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.500\nWhoop, did I just, nope,\nI thought I scrolled past it.\n\n267\n00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.195\nBut anyhow, somewhere here on this page\nthey've got the pricing for, holy moly,\n\n268\n00:12:55.195 --> 00:12:56.810\nthat's a big page.\n\n269\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.490\nSo they've got the pricing for\nhow much that bandwidth costs though, and\n\n270\n00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.930\nhow much they charge for it.\n\n271\n00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.570\nAnd it is charged by gigs in and\ngigs out, and what that's gonna be.\n\n272\n00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.680\nHere we go, right here.\n\n273\n00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.730\nSo for the first gigabyte out\nthey're charging nothing.\n\n274\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.580\nYou get the first gig for free, right?\n\n275\n00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.465\nFirst taste is always free,\nthat's how they do it.\n\n276\n00:13:13.465 --> 00:13:13.997\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n277\n00:13:13.997 --> 00:13:17.702\nthen up to 10 terabytes a month at\njust $0.09 per gig for that data, and\n\n278\n00:13:17.702 --> 00:13:19.300\nthen it goes up from there.\n\n279\n00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.120\nSo, you've gotta monitor that bandwidth\ncuz it's gonna cost you money, right?\n\n280\n00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.640\nOn your own private servers,\nyou've gotta monitor bandwidth,\n\n281\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.690\nnot because it costs you money, but\nbecause you might be running out.\n\n282\n00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.720\nYou need to make sure that you're\noperating within the boundaries of what\n\n283\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.130\nyou've got, all right?\n\n284\n00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.490\nNow, I kinda talked about monitoring.\n\n285\n00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.912\nHow do we monitor this stuff?\n\n286\n00:13:36.912 --> 00:13:38.990\nRight, if these are the metrics\nthat we wanna watch,\n\n287\n00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:44.130\nwe know we wanna watch our CPU, our\nmemory, our disk I/O and our network I/O.\n\n288\n00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.460\nThose are things that we want to watch.\n\n289\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.993\nHow do we watch them?\n\n290\n00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.295\nWell, it's up to us.\n\n291\n00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:50.590\nThere's a number of different technologies\nthat are out there that do it.\n\n292\n00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.853\nSo for example, in Windows you've\ngot the Windows Performance Monitor.\n\n293\n00:13:54.853 --> 00:13:58.549\nSo in Windows if I jump under my Tools and\nit's buried in here somewhere,\n\n294\n00:13:58.549 --> 00:14:01.110\nPerformance Monitor, there we go.\n\n295\n00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.180\n>> Then I can jump into\nthe Performance Monitor and\n\n296\n00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.670\nI can start adding in things to watch.\n\n297\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.130\nAnd if hit my little plus sign here\nI can pick from all sorts of things.\n\n298\n00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.460\nAnd if this is a Hyper-V host, what you'll\nsee is that Hyper-V actually has a lot of\n\n299\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.640\nits own metrics that we can get in and\nmonitor and get an idea of\n\n300\n00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.845\nour logical processors, our pages, our\nvirtual processors, partitions, and so on.\n\n301\n00:14:21.845 --> 00:14:24.810\n>> That you can monitor all of these and\nsee how they're doing.\n\n302\n00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.120\nThat works great in Windows if\nyou're monitoring a single system.\n\n303\n00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.138\nIf you've got a bunch of systems though,\nit starts to break down.\n\n304\n00:14:30.138 --> 00:14:32.200\nOr if you've got a mix.\n\n305\n00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.140\nMaybe I have some Hyper-V servers and\n\n306\n00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.325\nsome ESX servers, and\nnow I've got some challenges there.\n\n307\n00:14:37.325 --> 00:14:39.360\nSo the odds are if you're\ngonna monitor this stuff,\n\n308\n00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.660\nyou're gonna bring in a central\nmonitoring system, some kind of software.\n\n309\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.955\nMicrosoft has\nthe Systems Center Operations Manager.\n\n310\n00:14:45.955 --> 00:14:49.320\nVMware has the vCenter that\ncan monitor everything.\n\n311\n00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.970\nOne of the ones that I like to use is the\nSolar Winds Network Performance Monitor.\n\n312\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.950\nThey have a virtualization manager in\nthere that can monitor all this stuff.\n\n313\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.640\nThere's a number of different\nproducts out there that can give you\n\n314\n00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.270\na overarching view of your cloud and\nwhat your performance levels are.\n\n315\n00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:07.304\nAnd identify machines that are suffering\nor that are running out of resources, and\n\n316\n00:15:07.304 --> 00:15:08.871\neven take actions to fix those.\n\n317\n00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:12.590\nSo that's kind of an important\npiece of that that we can leverage.\n\n318\n00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.760\nNow, the way these monitoring\nsoftware packages work\n\n319\n00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.320\nis they leverage one of a handful\nof monitoring protocols.\n\n320\n00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.680\nAnd there's a couple out there.\n\n321\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.250\nOne of the most popular is SNMP, and\n\n322\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.810\nthat's the Simple Network Management\nProtocol, there we go, SNMP.\n\n323\n00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.700\nAnd it's a way that we can\nask servers a question, and\n\n324\n00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.290\nit'll respond back with answers.\n\n325\n00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.690\nSo you can ask it hey,\nwhat's your CPU utilization right now?\n\n326\n00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.140\nHow much RAM you using right now?\n\n327\n00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.060\nHow many virtual machines\nare you running right now?\n\n328\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.720\nAnd it'll answer you.\n\n329\n00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.690\nThe challenge with SNMP is,\n\n330\n00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.130\nyou don't ask it a question\nlike how many CPUs do you have.\n\n331\n00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.900\nYou ask it about what are called\nthese OIDs, these object identifiers.\n\n332\n00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.633\nAnd everything, every performance\ncounter has an object identifier and\n\n333\n00:15:52.633 --> 00:15:53.665\nyou have to know it.\n\n334\n00:15:53.665 --> 00:15:54.369\nSo, for example,\n\n335\n00:15:54.369 --> 00:15:57.101\nI wrote one down before this show cuz\nI don't have any of these memorized.\n\n336\n00:15:57.101 --> 00:16:02.622\nIn VMware if I wanna know what the CPU\nutilization is on the VMware host,\n\n337\n00:16:02.622 --> 00:16:09.630\nI have to send an SNMP request and\nask it for OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.3.\n\n338\n00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.590\n>> I got it.\n\n339\n00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:11.530\n>> Rolls right off the tongue.\n\n340\n00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.110\nI mean this is one of my favorite ones.\n\n341\n00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.320\nIt's almost as good as 3.7,\nwhich I don't know why that is.\n\n342\n00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.800\nBut you have to know all these\nOIDs which none of us know, right.\n\n343\n00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.880\nVMware publishes them, and\nI'm not just singling out VMware.\n\n344\n00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.260\nThis is how SMNP works so\nevery vendor does this.\n\n345\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.360\nSo VMware, for example, has a great\nknowledge base article where they have\n\n346\n00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.630\nthe MIB, or the management information\nbase, for SNMP for their VMware servers.\n\n347\n00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.760\nAnd it's got all their\nOIDs laid out in there and\n\n348\n00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.850\nexactly what you're supposed to\nbe asking and querying it for.\n\n349\n00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.500\nAnd how to get network bandwidth and\nCPU utilization, and\n\n350\n00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.200\ndisk utilization and all that other good\nstuff, it's got it all defined here.\n\n351\n00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.050\nAnd so if I have management software\nthat's gonna be watching my VMware servers\n\n352\n00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.300\nI can load this MIB into them.\n\n353\n00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.400\nThey probably already have it, but\nI can load this in if I need to, and\n\n354\n00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.070\nnow they'll understand how to ask\nthose servers the information, right?\n\n355\n00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.870\nIf you use Spiceworks, for example, a lot\nif times you have to load MIBs in there.\n\n356\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.050\nAnd then it'll start to watch it, and\nit can basically check that out and\n\n357\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.430\nstart to give you that data.\n\n358\n00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.590\nSo SNMP works great.\n\n359\n00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:13.440\nIt does take a little\nwork to get it set up.\n\n360\n00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.190\nBut once it's set up it really works well\nand there's some vendors out there like I\n\n361\n00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:19.060\nmentioned Solar Winds, when they've\nalready set all this stuff up for you.\n\n362\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.200\nIt really saves some time.\n\n363\n00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.520\nI'll show you their product\nhere in a few minutes.\n\n364\n00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:26.400\nAll right, now SNMP is not the only game\nin town although it is the most popular.\n\n365\n00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.320\nIn the Windows world,\n\n366\n00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.670\nMicrosoft has stopped supporting SNMP,\nit's kind of annoying.\n\n367\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.410\nBut what they did is they rolled out\ntheir own technology, called WMI,\n\n368\n00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.035\nthe Windows Management\nInstrumentation Interface.\n\n369\n00:17:37.035 --> 00:17:37.870\n>> Mm-hm, that's it.\n\n370\n00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.740\n>> It's actually, it's WMI, but they have\ntwo I's for some reason, I don't know why.\n\n371\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.490\nBut, it's just an alternative to SNMP,\n\n372\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.980\na way that we can ask\nWindows servers questions.\n\n373\n00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.770\nAnd, you don't have to turn it on, when\nI go into my performance monitor here,\n\n374\n00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.690\nit's actually using the WMI to do it.\n\n375\n00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:54.400\nAnd pull this information, so\nwindows is already using it internally.\n\n376\n00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.520\nIt's already on.\n\n377\n00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.780\nWe just need to query the machines and\nget that data.\n\n378\n00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.702\nSo if I'm running Systems Center\nOperations Manager, It can monitor all\n\n379\n00:18:00.702 --> 00:18:03.483\nthese servers via WMI, and\neven some of the other products, the third\n\n380\n00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:06.760\nparty products out there can do that too,\nso that's just another way to monitor.\n\n381\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.858\n>> And the WMI, if I understand right,\n\n382\n00:18:08.858 --> 00:18:13.461\nit can be just as complex as the OIDs that\nyou see inside of SNMP, which is why these\n\n383\n00:18:13.461 --> 00:18:17.389\nfront end interfaces make it extremely\neasy, or easier if you will,\n\n384\n00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:21.830\nto actually identify what the problem\nmight be that you're monitoring.\n\n385\n00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.120\nYeah WMI has its own query language,\nso it's almost like SQL,\n\n386\n00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.170\nwhere you've got a write a structured\nquery and reach out and grab that data.\n\n387\n00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:32.820\nYou've gotta know the tables and all this\ninformation and it is pretty challenging,\n\n388\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.810\nbut once you get it set\nup it works really well.\n\n389\n00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.030\nThere is a third protocol that's\nout there and it's called IPMI.\n\n390\n00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:42.124\nAnd IPMI's goal was to basically take away\nthe reliance on the software vendors,\n\n391\n00:18:42.124 --> 00:18:45.050\nright, because SNNP is\nadministered through software.\n\n392\n00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.746\nSo it's up to your operating system to\nsupport it, and Microsoft does WMI, so\n\n393\n00:18:48.746 --> 00:18:50.650\nit's dependent on Microsoft Windows.\n\n394\n00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.910\nWith IPMI, it's your hardware.\n\n395\n00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.610\nBasically a couple of\nvendors got together.\n\n396\n00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.587\nIntel, Dell, HP, NEC and\nhandful of others, and\n\n397\n00:18:57.587 --> 00:19:01.760\nthey created IPMI based on the hardware\nresources they were building.\n\n398\n00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.630\nSo they don't care what\noperating system you're running,\n\n399\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.590\nthis can monitor right from the hardware,\nvery cool stuff.\n\n400\n00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:10.640\nIPMI stands for\nIntelligent Platform Management Interface.\n\n401\n00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.130\nAnd it allows you to monitor resources,\nit also does a lot more.\n\n402\n00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.790\nSo for example, our firewall here is\nrunning on a server that has IPMI.\n\n403\n00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.420\nAnd I can use it to view\nthe screen of that system and\n\n404\n00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.190\nI can even mount virtual CDs to it.\n\n405\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.480\nYou can install a whole operating\nsystem through IPMI if you you want.\n\n406\n00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.620\nIt's really cool,\nit does a lot of neat things.\n\n407\n00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.490\nBut it gives you that kind of software\nindependent monitoring functionality,\n\n408\n00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.890\nthat's IPMI.\n\n409\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.710\nI will tell you,\neven though Dell developed it,\n\n410\n00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.390\nmost of their systems don't support IPMI,\nwhich I think is odd.\n\n411\n00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.280\nHP's same way like Dell\nhas their Lights-Out.\n\n412\n00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.920\nNo wait they have, is it the Lights-Out\nboard in Dell or Remote Insight?\n\n413\n00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.570\nI always screw these up.\n\n414\n00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.280\n>> It's Lights-Out in Dell, yup.\n\n415\n00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.860\n>> Okay, so HP has these Insight boards or\nI Low boards.\n\n416\n00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.000\nWhich are the Lights-Out.\n\n417\n00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.870\nDell has some too.\n\n418\n00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:59.880\nDifferent vendors have these different\nboards that they kind of replace what\n\n419\n00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.780\nIPMI does.\n\n420\n00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.290\nBut if you get,\nwhat's that cheap server hardware company?\n\n421\n00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.100\nSuper Micro.\n\n422\n00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.680\nSuper Micro, they always put IPMI\nsupport on their motherboards.\n\n423\n00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.520\nAnd so there's plenty of people\nout there that do support it but\n\n424\n00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.230\nit is just a third one that's out there.\n\n425\n00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.170\nNow, what all these protocols do,\nSNMP, WMI, IPMI,\n\n426\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:19.680\nthey all give you basically\ndata on a server, right.\n\n427\n00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.660\nWhat you do with that data is up to you.\n\n428\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.841\nAnd so we'll typically combine\nthis with alerting, right.\n\n429\n00:20:23.841 --> 00:20:27.410\nWe wanna get alerts, information about\nwhat's going on in these systems,\n\n430\n00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.700\nbecause then we can create\nautomated responses.\n\n431\n00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.380\nFor example, if one server is\nrunning out of memory, and\n\n432\n00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.640\nwe get an alert that says this server's\nlow on RAM, we could automatically move\n\n433\n00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.440\nsome virtual machines off of that host and\nmove them to another host, right.\n\n434\n00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.820\nThrough resource balancing.\n\n435\n00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.830\nCitrix, they have a great product for\n\n436\n00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.230\ntheirs that does resource based load\nbalancing across their systems.\n\n437\n00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.420\nAnd it's moving VMs, and it's really neat.\n\n438\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.260\nI've worked in environments\nthat used it before.\n\n439\n00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.610\nIt was cool cuz you could come\nin in the morning and you'd say,\n\n440\n00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.410\nI need to work on the web server,\nwhere is that?\n\n441\n00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.310\nYou needed to figure out where the web\nserver was cuz it could be moved around\n\n442\n00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.520\nfrom hardware to give the best\nperformance possible, really cool stuff.\n\n443\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.240\nVMware has some technology like that.\n\n444\n00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.330\nMicrosoft will do that if you have a full\nsystem center deployment on top of it.\n\n445\n00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.320\nIt won't do it by itself.\n\n446\n00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.350\nSo you've got different options\nthroughout there for that, too.\n\n447\n00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:17.130\nBut on the alerting side, a lot of these\nsystems can kick out emails, right.\n\n448\n00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.430\nSo they can send an SMTP email to you.\n\n449\n00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.830\nThey can send you a text message,\nlike an SMS.\n\n450\n00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.280\nThey can do that to basically\nlet you know there's an alert,\n\n451\n00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.850\nor problem going on in the network.\n\n452\n00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.640\nThey can do SNMP, right?\n\n453\n00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.610\nSNMP, we can use it for queries to\nask servers about their information.\n\n454\n00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.090\nBut SNMP can also do traps.\n\n455\n00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:36.380\nIt can send alerts out and\nyou can take action on that.\n\n456\n00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:40.700\nYou've got web services\nlike HTTP POST messages,\n\n457\n00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.140\nyou can have these web URL\nhooks built into your system.\n\n458\n00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.370\nThey can take all sorts of actions.\n\n459\n00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.620\nIt can call a PHP script and\ndo all sorts of stuff.\n\n460\n00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.520\nAnd then just good old syslog, the system\nlog that's built into every Unix system.\n\n461\n00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.360\nWe can have it generate syslog events and\nthen track those and\n\n462\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.800\nthen kinda see where it's going.\n\n463\n00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.110\nSo really a lot of power from\nthese monitoring systems.\n\n464\n00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.000\nIt all comes down to the one\nthat you choose, though.\n\n465\n00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.140\nAnd I've talked for\n20 minutes now about monitoring.\n\n466\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.000\nLet's see an example.\n\n467\n00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.710\nWe'll see one of these in action and\nI mentioned SolarWinds,\n\n468\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.090\nthey have a great product.\n\n469\n00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.553\nI wanna show you their product and\nkind how it works, and\n\n470\n00:22:13.553 --> 00:22:15.820\ngive you an idea of what\nyou can do with monitoring.\n\n471\n00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.943\nSo their product is called\nthe Network Performance Monitor, and\n\n472\n00:22:18.943 --> 00:22:21.838\nI like it because it's really\nvendor independent, right,\n\n473\n00:22:21.838 --> 00:22:24.980\nthey don't care if you're running\nHyper-V or ESX or whatever.\n\n474\n00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.260\nThey can monitor it and\nshow you what's going on.\n\n475\n00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.544\nAnd so they've got a little online\ndemo here that I've pulled up, and\n\n476\n00:22:30.544 --> 00:22:35.050\nyou'll see where they're monitoring some\nVMware servers and some Hyper-V servers.\n\n477\n00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:38.260\nAnd right off the bat, I can see\nthis Hyper-V server's got a problem.\n\n478\n00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.110\nAnd if I float my mouse over it,\n\n479\n00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:46.160\nI can see that that server is at\n96% CPU load and 93% memory load.\n\n480\n00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.170\nIt's pretty low on resources, right?\n\n481\n00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.050\nNotice it's got network\nutilization there also.\n\n482\n00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:53.580\nIt's at 1%, and\nit's running eight virtual machines, and\n\n483\n00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.520\nits response time is zero milliseconds.\n\n484\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.870\nIt looks like on the network\nside this guys fine, right,\n\n485\n00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:59.950\nit's just out of CPU and RAM.\n\n486\n00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.720\nNow, how can I fix that?\n\n487\n00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.930\nWell it's got eight VMs on it.\n\n488\n00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.410\nI bet I can take one of those VMs and\nmove it somewhere else and\n\n489\n00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.410\nrelease the pressure on this machine.\n\n490\n00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.447\nWhen I start looking at my other\nsystems like this other Hyper-V server,\n\n491\n00:23:11.447 --> 00:23:13.480\nit's at 5% CPU and 52% memory.\n\n492\n00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.460\nIt's got room.\n\n493\n00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.680\nSo I could move a VM over here,\nstart to balance things, right?\n\n494\n00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.500\nSo really neat that you\ncan be able to see that,\n\n495\n00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.220\nhave that visibility inside of a system.\n\n496\n00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.070\nLooking at some of these other guys,\n\n497\n00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.710\nit looks like we've got various\nproblems all across the board.\n\n498\n00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.620\nSo there's several different ones\nhere that are exhibiting issues.\n\n499\n00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.510\nBut you can also drill down and get a lot\nmore detailed data on these systems.\n\n500\n00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.870\nSo if I take a look at this\none Hyper-V Server here.\n\n501\n00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.560\nLet me click on that.\n\n502\n00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.560\nAnd when you drill into it,\n\n503\n00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:45.540\nwhat you'll find is things like,\nhow long has it been down for?\n\n504\n00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.840\nMaybe this is just a fluke, this is a one\ntime peak thing and I can ignore it.\n\n505\n00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.930\nOr maybe this has been going on for\na long time.\n\n506\n00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.720\nIn fact, if I look at it now, I can see\nthat average CPU load and memory use,\n\n507\n00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.070\nthey're both in the red, right.\n\n508\n00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.961\nThat's a problem.\n\n509\n00:23:57.961 --> 00:24:00.387\nBut how long has it been like that?\n\n510\n00:24:00.387 --> 00:24:04.242\nSo maybe I take my CPU load and\nI'll drill into that.\n\n511\n00:24:04.242 --> 00:24:06.900\nAnd start to get laid out for\nme over time, right?\n\n512\n00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.350\nWhat is my trend, what is my load?\n\n513\n00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.330\nAnd as I start to look at it here, well,\n\n514\n00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.400\nmaybe my time is not\nright here on this one.\n\n515\n00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.950\nBut it looks like it's kinda flat lined,\nit's actually not busy at all right now.\n\n516\n00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.230\nSo what the heck's that all about?\n\n517\n00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.546\nWell, I can come down here and\nI can tell it what to monitor.\n\n518\n00:24:22.546 --> 00:24:24.450\nDo I want to watch the last 24 hours?\n\n519\n00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:26.280\nOr do I want to watch today, or whatever.\n\n520\n00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.979\nSo maybe I'll go to the last 24 hours.\n\n521\n00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.900\nAnd we'll refresh that, and\nsee what it's been like,\n\n522\n00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.650\nand I do see some, you know, a little\nextra traffic way back here at midnight.\n\n523\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.790\nBut for the most part,\nthis server is not busy.\n\n524\n00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:43.170\nSo, whatever alert that I triggered\nthat it was showing high CPU,\n\n525\n00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.520\nit's apparently resolved itself and\nit's gone away, right?\n\n526\n00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.140\nSo now, I need to start thinking about,\nwhat about longer periods of time,\n\n527\n00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:54.700\nwhat if I want like the last month of\ndata, and so we go in and refresh that.\n\n528\n00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.050\nIt could also be that my sample\nintervals not close enough.\n\n529\n00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:01.450\nBut looking at my month of data,\nthis server is really not very busy.\n\n530\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.140\nSo I'm more than likely\nlooking at a fluke.\n\n531\n00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.580\nIt just happened to spike and\n\n532\n00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.610\nhit those high numbers, I don't\nnecessarily need to take an action.\n\n533\n00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.810\nAnd that's what monitoring\nsoftware like this can do for us.\n\n534\n00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:15.120\nIt's very powerful in letting you see what\nall's going on inside of your environment.\n\n535\n00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.446\nAnd it's even cooler when you're able\nto monitor multiple types of systems.\n\n536\n00:25:18.446 --> 00:25:22.200\nI can monitor my VMware servers,\nmy Hyper-V servers, my Storage, right?\n\n537\n00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.786\nSo if I've got a SAN in place, and\n\n538\n00:25:23.786 --> 00:25:26.300\nyou can even view additional\ndata on these systems.\n\n539\n00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.620\nSo, for example,\nif I'm doing syslogging, right?\n\n540\n00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.583\nSo, maybe I drive into\none of these systems,\n\n541\n00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:33.870\nand I'll pull up this VCenter server here.\n\n542\n00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.140\nWhen I go into the VCenter server and\nstart looking at its data,\n\n543\n00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.900\nyou can collect the syslog data and\nhave it posted right here inside of it.\n\n544\n00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.570\nAnd let's see, have they done that for us?\n\n545\n00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:45.830\nAnd, it doesn't look like it.\n\n546\n00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.785\nWe've got other statistics and\nperformance metrics.\n\n547\n00:25:48.785 --> 00:25:51.597\nYou got a lot in here,\nbased on storage, network, and so on.\n\n548\n00:25:51.597 --> 00:25:54.916\nIt's all being collected\nin easy to read format,\n\n549\n00:25:54.916 --> 00:25:59.668\none that we can kinda take a look at and\nexplore, but they also support.\n\n550\n00:25:59.668 --> 00:26:01.737\nApparently, they haven't set it up, but\n\n551\n00:26:01.737 --> 00:26:05.469\nthey do also support where you can bring\nin the syslogs for these systems and,\n\n552\n00:26:05.469 --> 00:26:08.190\nlet me jump over and\nsee if I can find the syslog server.\n\n553\n00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:09.200\nHere it is.\n\n554\n00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.840\nAnd I'll show you an example\nof the syslogs that come in.\n\n555\n00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.590\nHere we go.\n\n556\n00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:15.160\nSo here's syslog messages that\nare coming in from different systems.\n\n557\n00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.520\nAnd you'll see where\nit's just reporting in.\n\n558\n00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.840\nA lot of these are just informational\nmessages that we ignore.\n\n559\n00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.940\nSome are really critical though,\n\n560\n00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.790\nand there are actions that\nwe need to take if it's red.\n\n561\n00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.500\nAnd you can filter by time.\n\n562\n00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.786\nSo if somebody calls and says, hey, the\nsystem was really slow yesterday at 2 PM,\n\n563\n00:26:28.786 --> 00:26:31.433\nokay, well,\nwhat was going on yesterday at 2 PM?\n\n564\n00:26:31.433 --> 00:26:35.581\nYou can come up here and set a time\nperiod, and we can customize that.\n\n565\n00:26:35.581 --> 00:26:40.856\nAnd we can come in and\nspecify that I wanna begin yesterday at,\n\n566\n00:26:40.856 --> 00:26:48.175\nyou know, maybe I look at 1 PM, and I'll\nend it yesterday at 2 PM, or 3 PM, right?\n\n567\n00:26:48.175 --> 00:26:52.763\nSo I'm gonna get the time around\nthat failure, that issue, right?\n\n568\n00:26:52.763 --> 00:26:55.744\nSo I'm specifying that time interval\nto get basically before and\n\n569\n00:26:55.744 --> 00:26:57.500\nafter that failure issue.\n\n570\n00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.196\nAnd so then I can refresh it, and now I'm\ngonna see my syslog messages that were\n\n571\n00:27:01.196 --> 00:27:04.846\noccurring during that time and, well,\nhere's something big red, right?\n\n572\n00:27:04.846 --> 00:27:05.926\nI've got some kind of problem.\n\n573\n00:27:05.926 --> 00:27:06.681\nI kind of lucked out on that one.\n\n574\n00:27:06.681 --> 00:27:10.079\n[LAUGH] So I can look in here and well,\nit's just not very exciting here.\n\n575\n00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:11.797\nUnknown user name or bad password.\n\n576\n00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:13.434\nSomebody tried to login and\nit didn't work.\n\n577\n00:27:13.434 --> 00:27:14.640\nAll right, well, that's not exciting.\n\n578\n00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.750\nBut, if I have performance\nthresholds that are being broken or\n\n579\n00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.530\nwhatever I can see those here, and\nyou can set up automated responses and\n\n580\n00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:24.070\nactions to take when a failure occurs,\nit can notify you and so on.\n\n581\n00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.740\nThis is what management software does, and\nhaving a centralized management platform\n\n582\n00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.010\nlike this, be it SolarWinds or\nbe it any of the other ones, right?\n\n583\n00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:36.664\nSystem Center Operations Manager,\nIBM's Tivoli, VM, what's the other one?\n\n584\n00:27:36.664 --> 00:27:40.970\nCloud, Cloudtastic, something crazy,\nCloudify, Cloudify, those platforms,\n\n585\n00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:44.377\nthey can monitor your private and\npublic clouds and give you great,\n\n586\n00:27:44.377 --> 00:27:48.443\neasy to read metric data and information\nthat helps you make decisions on whether\n\n587\n00:27:48.443 --> 00:27:52.720\nyou've got the right hardware or enough\nhardware, to support your environments.\n\n588\n00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.070\nIt's very powerful stuff.\n\n589\n00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.990\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n590\n00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.520\nAll right.\n\n591\n00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.460\nSo, we've looked at a lot of good\ninformation within this episode.\n\n592\n00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.470\nWe talked about some of\nthe metrics that you can see.\n\n593\n00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:03.190\nWhat is it that we're gonna be monitoring.\n\n594\n00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.430\nWe talked about, for instance,\nsome of the resources.\n\n595\n00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.550\nRemember the four horsemen.\n\n596\n00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.580\nWe've got RAM, CPU, hard drive, and\n\n597\n00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.640\nnetwork utilization, anyone of these\nfails, it brings everything to a halt.\n\n598\n00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.659\nWe've also looked at things like, for\ninstance, alerts, being able to send out\n\n599\n00:28:17.659 --> 00:28:23.057\nalerts through things like SMS messages,\nemail, syslog, HTP, or HTTP, excuse me.\n\n600\n00:28:23.057 --> 00:28:26.534\nWe've also talked about the Windows\nManagement Interface, IPMI, and\n\n601\n00:28:26.534 --> 00:28:29.850\na bunch of other methods that you\ncan use to monitor these resources.\n\n602\n00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:31.890\nA lot of good information in this episode.\n\n603\n00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.510\nDon, do you have anything else for us?\n\n604\n00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.350\n>> I think that's about it.\n\n605\n00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.350\nJust remember, there's plenty\nof products out there, right?\n\n606\n00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.770\nSo pick the one that works for you.\n\n607\n00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.540\nBut the key thing is,\nyou've got to monitor for performance.\n\n608\n00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.600\nYou've got to know when\nyour system is suffering.\n\n609\n00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.940\nBecause if you don't know about it,\nyour end users certainly do, right?\n\n610\n00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.231\nSo that's definitely part of the problem,\nyou've gotta keep your,\n\n611\n00:28:47.231 --> 00:28:49.760\nkind of,\nyour thumb on the pulse of your network.\n\n612\n00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.210\nAnd monitoring solutions\nis how we do that.\n\n613\n00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.840\n>> Very good, Don, and as always,\nit's a pleasure having you here, and\n\n614\n00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.050\nthank you for that information,\nbut we're gonna go ahead and\n\n615\n00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:59.580\nsign off here at ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n616\n00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.338\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n617\n00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:01.929\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:16.470\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\n\n4\n00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.270\nand in today's episode, we're gonna be\nmoving along in our cloud plus series.\n\n5\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.620\nNow in some of the past episodes,\nwe've been talking about,\n\n6\n00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.950\nwell the resources that we have for\nour systems, right.\n\n7\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.810\nWe've talked about what type of resources,\nhow to optimize those resources.\n\n8\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.100\nNow, today we're going to talk about how\nyou actually allocate those resources.\n\n9\n00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.960\nAnd that's what this episode's going\nto be all about, allocating resources.\n\n10\n00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.760\nWe have none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet here to help us out.\n\n11\n00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.950\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.720\n>> I'm doing great Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.020\nGlad to be back on the show and\n\n14\n00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.690\nready to jump back into\nthe world of cloud computing.\n\n15\n00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.480\nAnd just like Wes sad, we're going to be\ntalking about allocating resources and\n\n16\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.140\nI I know what you're thinking.\n\n17\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.070\nIn a previous episode, I showed you\nguys how to spin out virtual machines,\n\n18\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.150\nand we saw how to assign resources to VMs,\nso we kind of already understand\n\n19\n00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.800\nhow to do it,\nwhat the heck's this episode all about?\n\n20\n00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.415\nWell what we wanna do here is take\na look at not how to attach a network\n\n21\n00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:08.190\nadapter to a VM or how to assign four\ngigs of RAM versus six gigs of RAM.\n\n22\n00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.990\nBut the best practices behind assigning\nthose resources, the things we always need\n\n23\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.070\nto keep in the back of our mind\nwhenever we assign that RAM.\n\n24\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.460\nAnd Wes and I were having a bit of\na conversation about this before the show.\n\n25\n00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.750\nIt's so easy to add resources to\na VM that it puts you at risk.\n\n26\n00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.450\nThere's a lot of mistakes that can happen,\n\n27\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.150\na lot of different kind\nof pitfalls that happen.\n\n28\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.560\nAnd these didn't happen in\nthe physical server days.\n\n29\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.620\nWhen you had physical servers that you\ndeployed, if I had eight gigs of RAM in\n\n30\n00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.520\nthere and I decided I wanted to go to 16,\nit wasn't a matter of flipping a switch.\n\n31\n00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.230\nI had to get a purchase order and quotes.\n\n32\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.710\nI had to buy the memory,\nget it shipped in.\n\n33\n00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.700\nThere was a lot that had to happen.\n\n34\n00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.570\nAnd so we had to really, really want that.\n\n35\n00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.860\nAnd there was a dollar sign attached\nto it that was an immediate thing.\n\n36\n00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.700\nWe had to pay to get it.\n\n37\n00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.850\nAnd that acted as a gateway.\n\n38\n00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.000\nIt acted as a safety net for\nassigning resources.\n\n39\n00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.210\nIn a virtual world, it's not like that.\n\n40\n00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.770\nIn a virtual world, you likely have a pool\nof resources already available just\n\n41\n00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.850\nsitting there waiting to be grabbed.\n\n42\n00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.080\nAnd the temptation to just reach out and\ngrab that memory is really easy.\n\n43\n00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.150\nAnd it's challenging.\n\n44\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.230\nSo we gotta be careful with that.\n\n45\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.990\nIt doesn't mean you can't,\n\n46\n00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.020\nthe stuff is there you might as well\nuse it, but we've gotta be careful.\n\n47\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.690\nAnd we have to be careful not just\nwithin the virtual machines, but\n\n48\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.150\non our physical hosts also.\n\n49\n00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.740\nSo we're gonna talk about those\nresources from both perspectives today,\n\n50\n00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.560\nthe physical host as well as the logical,\nthe VMs.\n\n51\n00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.190\nAnd just see the things\nwe need to be aware of\n\n52\n00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.000\nas we start assigning out these\nresources and the various pitfalls.\n\n53\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.940\nWe're just gonna take a look at\nthat from kind of a higher level.\n\n54\n00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.260\n>> So you mentioned 64 gigs of RAM,\nDon, and you're gonna allocate to one\n\n55\n00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.340\nof these virtual machines,\nyou're gonna allocate eight gigs.\n\n56\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.210\nThat means, in theory, right,\nI should be able to have what?\n\n57\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.550\nEight virtual machines with\neight gigs of ram of piece.\n\n58\n00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.470\n>> You'd think that, it is nice\nif you slice out the eight gigs,\n\n59\n00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.380\nwe give it to the VM and it's got it, and\nif we have eight VMs with eight gigs each,\n\n60\n00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.920\nthat's 64 gigs.\n\n61\n00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.270\nBut you've always gotta remember,\nyou've got your underlying host.\n\n62\n00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.910\nAnd the underlying host, they need\nmemory too, or they don't function.\n\n63\n00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.680\nAnd I know We showed that\ndiagram in another episode of\n\n64\n00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.380\na type one hypervisor and\nhow the host is technically a VM itself,\n\n65\n00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.100\nrunning on top of the hypervisor, but we\ndon't really see that when we look at it.\n\n66\n00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.730\nAnd when you run VMware ESX,\nit's actually a little Linux box\n\n67\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.280\nthat's running on there, and it's running\ndirectly on top of the hypervisor.\n\n68\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.780\nIf you're running Citrix XenServer, it's\na Linux box running on the hypervisor.\n\n69\n00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.430\nIf you're running Windows, but\n\n70\n00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.360\nlike Hyper-V, it's actually a Microsoft\nWindows operating system that's running.\n\n71\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.400\nAnd each of those OS's have\ndifferent requirements, right.\n\n72\n00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.450\nSo for example, Windows,\n\n73\n00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.320\nthe minimum amount of memory\nit can have is one gig of RAM.\n\n74\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.952\nAnd ideally, they want you to have\ntwo gigs or more on 64-bit system.\n\n75\n00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:41.450\nSo I need to set that memory aside too.\n\n76\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.560\nYou don't allocate that in Hyper-V because\nit's not technically a part of Hyper-V.\n\n77\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.700\nIt's a part of the host OS.\n\n78\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.640\nSo you need to check your vendor\ndocumentation before you start doling out\n\n79\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.895\nyour memory, because there is some memory\nthat needs to be set aside for that host.\n\n80\n00:03:54.895 --> 00:03:56.875\nThat's really important.\n\n81\n00:03:56.875 --> 00:04:02.095\nAnd on ESX and on ZenServer, it's actually\nnot a whole heck of a lot of memory.\n\n82\n00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:05.415\nIf I remember, on ZenServer, it's\nsomething weird like 684 megs of memory,\n\n83\n00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:07.280\nsomething bizarre like that.\n\n84\n00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.570\nOn VMware ESX, I'm pretty sure it's a gig.\n\n85\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.540\nI'll have to check\nthe documentation on that.\n\n86\n00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.070\nOn Windows, I know a gig is\nthe minimum you can get away with, but\n\n87\n00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.810\nthey recommend two gigs for that host OS.\n\n88\n00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.930\nSo I start to lose some of that memory.\n\n89\n00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.280\nThe other thing is,\n\n90\n00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.820\nwhen you deploy your virtual machines,\nIt's expecting you to do servers.\n\n91\n00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.560\nBut some people do work stations like VDI,\nvirtual desktop infrastructure.\n\n92\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.430\nAnd if you're doing desktop OSs when\nyou deploy them inside of a VM,\n\n93\n00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.390\nyou might choose to turn\non 3D acceleration.\n\n94\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.210\nThis is an option inside of a lot\nof virtualization software.\n\n95\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.210\nAnd when you do that it asks for\na video card memory and\n\n96\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.160\nthat video card memory is\nimportant because it adds up fast.\n\n97\n00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.770\nIf I'm doing virtual desktops and\n\n98\n00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.690\nI decide that each desktop is gonna\nhave two gigs of RAM, all right?\n\n99\n00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.520\nWell, I've got 64 gigs of RAM on my host.\n\n100\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.350\nI've got plenty of room.\n\n101\n00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.620\nI can create 30 desktops pretty easy,\nright?\n\n102\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.760\nWell, if each one of them gets 256 mgs of\nvideo memory And I've got 30 other things.\n\n103\n00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.600\nI just picked something\nwith hard math didn't I?\n\n104\n00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.350\nAnyhow it's like seven and\n\n105\n00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.800\na half gigs of memory that's tied up\nin this virtual video cards right?\n\n106\n00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.440\nAnd that's another thing I\nhave to take into account.\n\n107\n00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.590\nSo remember when you\nallocate memory like that\n\n108\n00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.430\nyour physical host needs\nenough memory to support this.\n\n109\n00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.280\nAnd then your VMs,\nthey each are slicing out that memory and\n\n110\n00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.050\nthey're having to slice\naway video card memory too,\n\n111\n00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.510\ndefinitely things that\nyou kinda factored in.\n\n112\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.720\nNow, static assignments work great,\n\n113\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.360\nbecause you know when you\nassign the memory, it's got it.\n\n114\n00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.370\nIf I give a virtual\nmachine eight gigs of RAM.\n\n115\n00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.000\nIt always has eight gigs of RAM, It\nstarts consuming it right at that moment.\n\n116\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.310\nInside a virtual machine it might not\nbe using all eight gigs, though, right?\n\n117\n00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.910\nIt might only be using two\ngigs of that memory, and\n\n118\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.900\nthe rest of it's sitting there empty,\nbut the memory is reserved.\n\n119\n00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.370\nAnd that's the default function\nof most virtualization software.\n\n120\n00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.240\nI'm gonna say most.\n\n121\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.760\nIt's the default function for every\nvirtualization software that I use, but\n\n122\n00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.470\nI'm sure that it could be something out\nthere that defaults something different.\n\n123\n00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.100\nBut they almost all have\noptions these days to\n\n124\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.420\nflip away from that behavior of\nstatic assignments and to go dynamic.\n\n125\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.310\nAnd what is dynamic?\n\n126\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.640\nWell, dynamic is where we say, hey instead\nof saying I'm gonna give you eight gigs\n\n127\n00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.340\nright here whether you use it or not, I'm\ngonna give you a certain amount of memory.\n\n128\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.440\nAnd if you're not using it I'll loan\nit out to other servers, other VMs.\n\n129\n00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.900\nRight, we can have memory sharing,\nthis is dynamic memory allocation.\n\n130\n00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.230\nAnd there's a few different\nnames you'll hear for it.\n\n131\n00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.390\nMicrosoft calls it dynamic\nmemory allocation,\n\n132\n00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.760\nVMware calls it transparent\npage sharing TPS?\n\n133\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.460\nShoot, well actually that's\na slightly different one.\n\n134\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.750\nYou'll hear different terminology,\n\n135\n00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.470\nthin provisioning is another\nterm that's out there.\n\n136\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.440\nAnd whatever, CompTIA likes to\ncall it memory ballooning, right.\n\n137\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.000\nAnd memory ballooning is probably\none of the best names for it,\n\n138\n00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.890\njust kinda the most standard generic name.\n\n139\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.980\nBut you don't see a lot\nof the vendors use it.\n\n140\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.920\nAnd it's just that idea of like a balloon,\nright, memory grows and\n\n141\n00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.960\nshrinks based on your usage.\n\n142\n00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.960\nThe challenge here is\nWith memory ballooning\n\n143\n00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.450\nI can assign more memory than I have,\nright.\n\n144\n00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.220\nYou know, Wes gave the example of if\nI've got 64 gigs of physical memory,\n\n145\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.235\nI could have eight VMs with\neight gigs each, that's 64 gigs.\n\n146\n00:07:09.235 --> 00:07:11.205\nBut I didn't account for my host, right?\n\n147\n00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:12.855\nI didn't account for the video cards.\n\n148\n00:07:12.855 --> 00:07:16.635\nBut that's okay, because those eight VMs\nlikely aren't using all eight gigs of that\n\n149\n00:07:16.635 --> 00:07:17.275\nmemory, right?\n\n150\n00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:20.145\nThey might only be using two or\nthree or even four gigs, and so\n\n151\n00:07:20.145 --> 00:07:23.925\nthe extra memory can be reclaimed,\nand made available to other hosts, so\n\n152\n00:07:23.925 --> 00:07:27.370\nI can actually allocate\nmore memory than I have.\n\n153\n00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.950\nNow as a best practice,\n\n154\n00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.570\nyou don't wanna do that in production\nunless you know you can rely on it.\n\n155\n00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.380\nCuz it creates the illusion of having\nmemory that isn't necessarily there.\n\n156\n00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.190\nWhen you're monitoring\nperformance in the VMs,\n\n157\n00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.270\nthey'll show as having\neight gigs of memory,\n\n158\n00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.030\neven though the eight gigs might not\nreally be available because of other VMs.\n\n159\n00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.650\nAnd so\nwe have to do constant monitoring of that.\n\n160\n00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.950\nWe've gotta monitor the VMs.\n\n161\n00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.760\nWe've gotta monitor the host.\n\n162\n00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.434\nCuz the host is what's gonna give us that\nreal vision of what's actually going on.\n\n163\n00:07:54.434 --> 00:07:57.187\n>> Now Don, with something like\nthat one of the concerns, and\n\n164\n00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:58.949\ncorrect me if I'm wrong here on that,\n\n165\n00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:02.090\nis if I've got a series of virtual\nmachines and I'm doing the memory\n\n166\n00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.921\nballooning technique that you're talking\nabout These are production servers.\n\n167\n00:08:05.921 --> 00:08:10.292\nIt seems like there'd be a situation that\nyou might run into where maybe you're\n\n168\n00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:14.010\nexpecting one VM to have a certain\namount of RAM, in order to support\n\n169\n00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.010\na functionality, and it's been\nallocated to other virtual machines.\n\n170\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.340\nIs that a situation where you might\nactually decrease your performance?\n\n171\n00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.160\n>> Yeah, absolutely,\n\n172\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.380\ncuz what's gonna happen when it goes to\nrequest that memory that's not there?\n\n173\n00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.130\nIt's gonna page to disk,\nand when it pages to disk,\n\n174\n00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.870\nyou take a real big performance hit.\n\n175\n00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.500\nAnd I'm gonna talk a little bit more about\npaging to disk when we get to storage,\n\n176\n00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.190\nbut when we swap to disk,\ndisk speeds are way slower than memory.\n\n177\n00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.560\nThat's why it's so\nimportant to allocate out RAM properly.\n\n178\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.760\nAll right,\nnow dynamic memory I'm not a big fan of.\n\n179\n00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.930\nI'm not a big fan of it in production.\n\n180\n00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.310\nIn test environments, lab environments\nI use it all the time, but\n\n181\n00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.910\nin production environment\nI'm not a fan of it.\n\n182\n00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.900\nIf I give a VM eight gigs of RAM I want\nit to have that eight gigs of RAM and\n\n183\n00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:52.940\nknow that it's there.\n\n184\n00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.220\nAnd then I can measure performance\ninside a VM as well as on the host and\n\n185\n00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.310\nknow that I'm always\ngetting a true picture.\n\n186\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.240\nVersus when you use dynamic memory,\nif you monitor on the guest,\n\n187\n00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.480\nthose numbers aren't necessarily accurate.\n\n188\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.230\nAnd you've gotta monitor on the host,\nwhere things start to get aggregated, and\n\n189\n00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.260\nso it's just a little\nbit more challenging.\n\n190\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.080\nBut there are some technologies\nthat are really good.\n\n191\n00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.410\nVMWare, I mentioned\ntransparent page sharing.\n\n192\n00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.430\nI shouldn't have said that one, cuz\nit's not the same as memory ballooning.\n\n193\n00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.300\nWhat transparent page sharing does,\nis it does what's called deduplication.\n\n194\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.270\nAnd it says I might have\nfive Linux VMs fired up, and\n\n195\n00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.230\nif they're all running Cent OS 7.2, right?\n\n196\n00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.910\nThey're all running the exact same OS,\nthey're all running the same kernel.\n\n197\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.150\nThey might be running different software,\none might be running Apache,\n\n198\n00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.760\nanother one might be running MySQL.\n\n199\n00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.540\nOr heck,\nmaybe they are running the software.\n\n200\n00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.920\nMaybe we've got five web servers\nthat are all running Apache,\n\n201\n00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.280\nthey're all serving up the same Web pages,\nright?\n\n202\n00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.760\nIf I look at the memory footprint of\neach of those VMs, there's gonna be\n\n203\n00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.070\nunique stuff in there, but there's gonna\nbe a lot of common stuff in there too.\n\n204\n00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.990\nThere's gonna be a lot of things\nlike the Linux kernel itself\n\n205\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.860\nthat gets cached into RAM and is\nidentical between all five of those VMs,\n\n206\n00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.660\ncuz they're all running the same kernel.\n\n207\n00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.710\nAnd so what transparent page\nsharing does is it says, hey,\n\n208\n00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.420\ninstead of storing five copies of\nthis kernel, It's all the same.\n\n209\n00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.600\nLet's just combine that into one and give\neach of the VMs access to that same one.\n\n210\n00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.440\nNow on a positive side, that means\nthey're gonna consume less memory, and\n\n211\n00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.770\nit's still accessing it\nat regular memory speeds.\n\n212\n00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:17.500\nThat doesn't change.\n\n213\n00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.900\nIt just does one copy\ninstead of five copies.\n\n214\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.865\nOn a negative side, you sort of increase\nyour attack surface a little bit.\n\n215\n00:10:24.865 --> 00:10:28.280\nIn that one virtual machine technically\nhas the access to some memory that's\n\n216\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.910\navailable to another virtual machine.\n\n217\n00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.190\nNow the instant one VM tries to change it,\nthen it stops deduplicating and\n\n218\n00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.230\nit splits off into its own.\n\n219\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.630\nSo it's not really a security risk,\nbut there is that potential,\n\n220\n00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.450\nthat possibility, that very slim chance,\nand some people really don't like that.\n\n221\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.260\nBut it would be next to\nimpossible to exploit that.\n\n222\n00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.840\nSo, transparent page sharing is\nvery similar to dynamic memory\n\n223\n00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.280\nin that we can't count on\nit always working, right?\n\n224\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.530\nYou don't always know that you're\ngonna be able to deduplicate.\n\n225\n00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.630\nMaybe today I can, and\nthen I start doing updates.\n\n226\n00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.830\nAnd some of my VMs get updated,\nand some don't.\n\n227\n00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.340\nNow they've got different kernels,\nand they're not deduping anymore.\n\n228\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.790\nAnd now it's all split out and they've\nall got their own independent ones.\n\n229\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.490\nOr some other change occurs that makes\nthem unique enough where's they're no\n\n230\n00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.440\nlonger able to deduplicate and I lose it.\n\n231\n00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:14.020\nSo much like dynamic sharing, I can't\ncount on TPS to always do its work.\n\n232\n00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.360\nBut when it's on I get\na little more freedom, and\n\n233\n00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.660\nat a minimum I'm freeing up memory for\nthe host OS to breath right.\n\n234\n00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.060\nSo I may have given the host OS\nthe minimum amount of memory possible, but\n\n235\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.540\nnow I has a little bit of extra\nroom that I can take advantage of.\n\n236\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.340\nAnd we can always monitor it and\nsee what our actual gains are.\n\n237\n00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.586\nIt's very difficult for somebody to\ngive you a best practice on this right,\n\n238\n00:11:31.586 --> 00:11:35.150\nbecause we don't know, I don't know what\nsoftware you're gonna run on your VMs.\n\n239\n00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.980\nI don't know if you're\ngonna keep up to date.\n\n240\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.040\nI don't know what OS's\nyou're gonna run right?\n\n241\n00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.460\nAnd so it's hard for me to say whether\nTPS is gonna be successful for you.\n\n242\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.660\nBut you can always turn it on,\nmonitor it, check and see.\n\n243\n00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.510\nIf you get good gainss out of it,\nyou can leave it on.\n\n244\n00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.360\nIf you don't get good games out of it,\nturn it off.\n\n245\n00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.610\nAnd it's as simple as that.\n\n246\n00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.150\nYou can flip these things on and\noff on the VMs.\n\n247\n00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.430\nSo just be aware that the memory\nallocation in the VMs\n\n248\n00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.200\ncan be very different from the memory\nallocation on the physical host.\n\n249\n00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.970\nAnd on the physical host, it usually is\na matter of the more memory the better.\n\n250\n00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.360\nBut there's limits, right.\n\n251\n00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.290\nTo get a server today with 64 gigs of RAM\nis pretty easy and not that expensive.\n\n252\n00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.870\nTo get a server today with 128 gigs of\nRAM, you're gonna have to break out\n\n253\n00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.400\nthe pocketbook,\nthat one's gonna be a lot of money.\n\n254\n00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.660\nWell, instead of getting one\nserver with 128 gigs of RAM,\n\n255\n00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.710\nI could get two servers\nwith 64 gigs of RAM each.\n\n256\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.050\nI still get that amount of RAM, but\n\n257\n00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.950\nit's less expensive cuz I'm breaking\nit up into these individual servers.\n\n258\n00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.350\nAnd I actually get a little bit\nmore resiliency, redundancy,\n\n259\n00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.470\nyou get these more hosts, you end up\nbetter off usually, going that route.\n\n260\n00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.600\nBut now your management stuff\nbecomes a bit of a hassle.\n\n261\n00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.030\nAnd remember, with your virtualization\nplatform you're likely having to\n\n262\n00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.940\npay for it, right?\n\n263\n00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.030\nIf you're running KVN on top of Cent OS,\nthen you're not paying licensing fees for\n\n264\n00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.020\nthe host OS.\n\n265\n00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.410\nBut if you're running Windows server for\nHyperV,\n\n266\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.760\nthen you've got to have a Windows\nlicense for each physical machine.\n\n267\n00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.512\nAnd if you're running KVM on redhat,\n\n268\n00:12:55.512 --> 00:12:57.340\nyou've gotta have to have\nyour redhat licenses.\n\n269\n00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.664\nIf you're running VMWare ESX you\ngotta license each host based on\n\n270\n00:13:00.664 --> 00:13:02.070\nthe processors in it.\n\n271\n00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.700\nSo it does start to add\nup financially too.\n\n272\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.730\nYou've always got to be aware of that too.\n\n273\n00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.870\n>> Keep in mind that in the cloud we\nalso need computational power, right.\n\n274\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.610\nWe need to be able to\nprocess information and, Don,\n\n275\n00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.220\nI believe that takes us\nto our next component.\n\n276\n00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:14.820\nThe CPU, right?\n\n277\n00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.230\nThe brains of the operation.\n\n278\n00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.540\n>> Yeah, CPU is one that really\ngets overlooked, you know?\n\n279\n00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.790\nWith memory it's easy.\n\n280\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.660\nWe say I'm about to get eight gigs of RAM,\nI've got 64 gigs,\n\n281\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.480\nI just subtract it out and\nthat's what's left and there we go.\n\n282\n00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.735\nYou've got these numbers\nthat are easy to work with.\n\n283\n00:13:27.735 --> 00:13:29.375\nBut CPUs people forget about.\n\n284\n00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:34.375\nWith CPUs, there's three real\ncomponents that we have to worry about.\n\n285\n00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:37.125\nThere's the socket, so\nwhen you crack open that server and\n\n286\n00:13:37.125 --> 00:13:40.115\nyou look at the motherboard and\nyou look to find that CPU,\n\n287\n00:13:40.115 --> 00:13:44.125\neach physical CPU is\ninserted into a socket.\n\n288\n00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:46.020\nSo that's why they refer\nto them as sockets.\n\n289\n00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.270\nMost servers these days\nactually only have one socket.\n\n290\n00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.760\nYou can get them with two, four,\n\n291\n00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.850\neven eight, but\none has kind of become the standard.\n\n292\n00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.720\nAnd then inside of that CPU,\n\n293\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.800\nif you were to crack it open,\nthere's cores inside of it.\n\n294\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.290\nAnd you'd be hard pressed to find\na single core processor these days.\n\n295\n00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:06.720\nI haven't seen one in years.\n\n296\n00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.370\nThey're normally gonna to have two,\nfour, six, or even eight cores in it.\n\n297\n00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.860\nI know 12 core processors are just\nnow starting to hit the market.\n\n298\n00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.390\nSo a lot of cores inside of that CPU.\n\n299\n00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.840\nAnd each core can function\nindependently of the others.\n\n300\n00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.190\nAnd that's why we don't need\nmore sockets any more, right?\n\n301\n00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.770\nInstead of having two\nsockets in my system,\n\n302\n00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.740\nI can have one socket with\na dual core processor.\n\n303\n00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.560\nOr, I can have two processors\nthat are quad core each,\n\n304\n00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.950\nand now I get eight cores all together,\nright?\n\n305\n00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.350\nSo, I've got my physical CPU,\nand then the cores, and\n\n306\n00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.640\nthen on top of that,\nI might have hyper threading.\n\n307\n00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.450\nAnd if you have hyperthreading, that's\nwhere we say inside of a single core I\n\n308\n00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.030\nmight be able to carry on\ntwo operations at once.\n\n309\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:52.070\nAnd so in some circumstances,\none core can actually do double work.\n\n310\n00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.480\nSo if I have a quad core CPU,\n\n311\n00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.400\nI might actually get eight cores\nworth of functionality out of it.\n\n312\n00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.790\nAnd that, it's a big challenge.\n\n313\n00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.320\nWhen we start to go out and\nbuy our physical servers,\n\n314\n00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.380\nit's easy to look at it and say, I've\ngot eight cores, when in reality you've\n\n315\n00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.110\nonly got four and then you've got\nhyperthreading that's sometimes available.\n\n316\n00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.150\nJust like dynamic memory,\nit's really the same principle.\n\n317\n00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.570\nIt's dynamic memory.\n\n318\n00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.570\nIn a lab environment,\nI use that all the time.\n\n319\n00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.090\nIn a production environment, I don't like\nto take hyper threading into account.\n\n320\n00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.490\nAnd so, you've really got two options\nthere, and I really couldn't stress these\n\n321\n00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.330\nmore, is that in a production environment,\nyou wanna do one of two things.\n\n322\n00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.900\nEither one, turn off hyper threading.\n\n323\n00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.720\nJust turn off.\n\n324\n00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.990\nJust don't even have it and\nthat way all of your numbers are accurate.\n\n325\n00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.910\nYou don't have to worry about it.\n\n326\n00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.650\nEverything is as expected to be.\n\n327\n00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.550\nIf I have one core,\nI know it can do one task and that's it.\n\n328\n00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.870\nBut it is kind of a shame\nto waste that resource.\n\n329\n00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.584\nSometimes I could get that extra boost.\n\n330\n00:15:50.584 --> 00:15:54.665\nSo another option is,\nleave hyper threading on, leave it on so\n\n331\n00:15:54.665 --> 00:15:56.590\nyou've got eight cores, but\n\n332\n00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:01.756\nwhen you run your performance reports\nTreated as only having four cores right.\n\n333\n00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:03.015\nJust ignore those other four.\n\n334\n00:16:03.015 --> 00:16:05.900\nIgnore the other virtual\ncores that are there.\n\n335\n00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.540\nHey if they're there and\navailable at one time, great.\n\n336\n00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.180\nI'm okay with that, but\nI know I've got these other four.\n\n337\n00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.170\nI know I've always got them.\n\n338\n00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.610\nLet me just bank on that and\nI'll pretend the other ones aren't there.\n\n339\n00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.780\nRight.\nThat's a great way to ensure that you've\n\n340\n00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.620\nalways got the resources because otherwise\nyou might have a VM that goes to expect\n\n341\n00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:27.070\nthat hyper-threaded core to be active,\nand it goes, and whatever reason,\n\n342\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.700\nit's math that it's doing overlaps with\nthe math that's already on that core, and\n\n343\n00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.950\nit can't run on both at the same time.\n\n344\n00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.230\nAnd you're waiting in line as if\nyou'd only had one core, right.\n\n345\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.090\nSo that's kind of a challenge that\nwe bump into with hyper-threading.\n\n346\n00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.650\nThe other thing is when we start\nto dole out virtual machines,\n\n347\n00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.900\nit's not like memory,\nlet me show you an example here.\n\n348\n00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.680\nLet me fire up a HyperV server.\n\n349\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.760\nSo I've got a HyperV server here and\n\n350\n00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.210\nactually I have no idea how many\nprocessors are even in this thing.\n\n351\n00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.000\nLet's see.\n\n352\n00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.210\nSo if I jump in here and\ntake a look at my CPUs, so\n\n353\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:58.250\nthis HyperV server has one socket,\ntwo cores, four logical processors.\n\n354\n00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.500\nRight, so I've actually got two\ncores that I can count on and\n\n355\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.410\ntwo more that I'm getting\nthrough hyper threading.\n\n356\n00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.880\nSo that's what I've got, so\n\n357\n00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.380\nmy system shows as having\nthese different processors.\n\n358\n00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.900\nNow when I start to dole out virtual\nmachines, so if I jump in here, and\n\n359\n00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.650\nI whip up a new VM, so I'm just gonna\ncreate a new virtual machine, and\n\n360\n00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.770\nI'll just,\nI'm just gonna do some defaults here.\n\n361\n00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.740\nMaybe this will be like IT Pro TV, Web 01.\n\n362\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:26.270\nSo I'm gonna create a web server, and\nI'm just gonna, 512 megs of memory.\n\n363\n00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.670\nGreat, here you can see if I want to turn\non that dynamic memory, which I don't.\n\n364\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:35.290\nAnd if I wanted to do networking and disk,\nwhich I'll just cruise right through and\n\n365\n00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.180\nI'll finish that one up.\n\n366\n00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.250\nAll right, so\nI just whipped up a quick virtual machine.\n\n367\n00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:43.140\nNow if I pull up the settings for\nthat virtual machine, and\n\n368\n00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.830\nI take a look at what it got.\n\n369\n00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:50.400\nSo if I come down here to processor, it's\nassigned one virtual processor, all right?\n\n370\n00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.280\nIn the virtualization world\nwe have PCPUs and VCPUs.\n\n371\n00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.520\nPCPUs are your physical CPUs, and it's\nactually referring to your cores, right?\n\n372\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.330\nBut if I have hyper threading on, those\ncount too, so your PCPU could be counting\n\n373\n00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.370\nyour hyper-threaded cores,\nor just your regular cores.\n\n374\n00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.810\nIt gets really confusing.\n\n375\n00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:07.970\nBut your VCPUs,\n\n376\n00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.960\nyour virtual CPUs, these are just ones\nthat are created in your virtual platform.\n\n377\n00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.560\nAnd you may have more VCPUs than\nphysical CPUs, it'll let you do it.\n\n378\n00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.840\nIt created this with one VCPU, all right?\n\n379\n00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.810\nNow if I look in the background here, I've\ngot, how many VMs do I have now, eight?\n\n380\n00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.190\nSo I've got seven.\n\n381\n00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.490\nSeven VMs.\n\n382\n00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:32.690\nAssuming each one has one VCPU,\nI now have seven VCPUs.\n\n383\n00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:38.380\nAnd under the hood, I've only got\nfour PCPUs, four physical CPUs.\n\n384\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.000\nRight?\n\n385\n00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.200\nAnd of those, two are real.\n\n386\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.190\nTwo are hyperthreaded.\n\n387\n00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.740\nSo I really only have two CPUs.\n\n388\n00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.590\nBut I've got to seven defined right here,\nand I likely have more.\n\n389\n00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.760\nNow, is that a bad thing?\n\n390\n00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.200\nWith memory, that would be a bad thing.\n\n391\n00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.580\nI've over allocated.\n\n392\n00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.880\nI've assigned more processors\nthan I actually have.\n\n393\n00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.100\nBut with CPUs it's okay because when\nyou look at most virtual machines, and\n\n394\n00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.360\nmost physical machines for that matter,\nyou'll find a lot of them average\n\n395\n00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.480\nfive to 15% or so CPU utilization,\nit's really not a lot, right?\n\n396\n00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.030\nIt's very common to go out and\n\n397\n00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:14.200\nfind a production machine just sitting\nthere doing next to nothing, right?\n\n398\n00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.310\nIf I were to fire up one of\nthese domain controllers here,\n\n399\n00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:21.620\nlet me start this one, when it boots I\nexpect to see a spike in CPU, right?\n\n400\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.250\nSo it's booting up and that CPU\nutilization is gonna start climbing.\n\n401\n00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.810\nAnd [LAUGH] apparently I'm lying.\n\n402\n00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.760\nIt's 11%, right?\n\n403\n00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.660\nBut it'll climb as it boots up cuz\nit's actually having to do work.\n\n404\n00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.250\nBut once that domain controller is booted\nup and sitting there just handling\n\n405\n00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.000\nauthentication requests, you'll find\nthat CPU utilization start to drop.\n\n406\n00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.280\nRAM's a different story, right?\n\n407\n00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.040\nWe might consume RAM and\nreally be eating it up.\n\n408\n00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.430\nDisk I/O is another one.\n\n409\n00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:49.180\nBut CPU, unless you're running\nmathematical operations on that system,\n\n410\n00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.270\nthen it's usually not that high.\n\n411\n00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:55.580\nAnd so I don't want to do a one to\none mapping for these processors.\n\n412\n00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.580\nI don't want to say hey,\nI've got four cores,\n\n413\n00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.740\nso I'm only gonna create four VCPUs,\nand that's it.\n\n414\n00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.200\nBecause most of the time\nthese VCPUs are idled.\n\n415\n00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.600\nAnd if I'm constantly seeing 1%, or 5%, or\neven 10%, I can go ahead and overallocate.\n\n416\n00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.270\nAnd it'll be all right\ncuz I've got that room.\n\n417\n00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.000\nRight.\n\n418\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.560\nAnd you'll find different people give\nyou different best practices on this.\n\n419\n00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.300\nAnd the reason is there's\nno one size fits all.\n\n420\n00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.240\nCuz again, we don't know what\nsoftware you're running.\n\n421\n00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.300\nIf you're doing video encoding,\n\n422\n00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.080\nthe instant you start a video encoder,\nyou're CPU goes to a 100%.\n\n423\n00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.500\nVideo encoders will use all of\nthe CPU power available to them.\n\n424\n00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.360\nThat's how they work.\n\n425\n00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.540\nRight.\nCuz they wanna encode as fast as possible.\n\n426\n00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.910\nThe more CPU power they have,\nthe faster they get done.\n\n427\n00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.430\nThe less CPU power they have,\nthe longer they take to get done.\n\n428\n00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.190\nSo they just take 100%, and they use it.\n\n429\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.930\nSo if you're doing that,\nyou're gonna have a far lower\n\n430\n00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:47.080\nVCPU to PCPU mapping rate, or ratio.\n\n431\n00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.530\nBut if you're doing domain controllers\nin DNS servers, you might be 25 to one.\n\n432\n00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:56.010\nYou might have 25 VCPUs mapped\nto one physical CPU, right?\n\n433\n00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.968\nOr a 25 to one ratio, right?\n\n434\n00:20:57.968 --> 00:20:59.300\nSo it's up to you to figure that out.\n\n435\n00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.740\nThere are maybe times where\nyou need to go one to one.\n\n436\n00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.070\nAnd soft software will let you do that.\n\n437\n00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.690\nIt's called processor affinity,\nwhere I can take one VM and\n\n438\n00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.090\nI can say this VM is\ntied to this one core.\n\n439\n00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:13.870\nAll right, so if I want ITPROTV-WEB01\nto be tied to a particular core, well,\n\n440\n00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:14.775\nI got a bad example here.\n\n441\n00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:16.688\nHyperV won't let me do it, VMware will.\n\n442\n00:21:16.688 --> 00:21:21.450\nBut in HyperV, if I go back into\nprocessor, I can't come in and\n\n443\n00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.050\nmap it to a particular core.\n\n444\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.640\nI can assign it VCPUs and\n\n445\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.440\nthen I can set resource control\nwhere I can do reservations.\n\n446\n00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:37.460\nAnd so if I give it one CPU and\na 100% reservation, right?\n\n447\n00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:43.040\nNow, there will be a physical core\nreserved for this machine at all times.\n\n448\n00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:43.900\nOkay.\n\n449\n00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.950\nIt might not be the same core, it might be\ncore one right now and core two later and\n\n450\n00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.940\ncore three another time, but\nthere will always be one core reserved for\n\n451\n00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.900\nthis machine.\n\n452\n00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.510\nAnd that way,\n\n453\n00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:56.110\nif I fire up a video encoder, it'll\nspike to 100% it'll peg out that core.\n\n454\n00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.950\nIf I wanna do more than one core,\n\n455\n00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:04.690\nthough, it's not gonna happen unless\nI add more virtual processors.\n\n456\n00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:09.760\nIf I add another virtual processor,\nnow see how that virtual machine reserve?\n\n457\n00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.890\nI had it set to 100%, right?\n\n458\n00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.740\nWhen I was at one CPU it showed that\nthat was 25% of my system resources.\n\n459\n00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.070\nWhen I bump it up to two,\nnow it's 50% of my resources.\n\n460\n00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.735\nIf I bump it up to three or even four,\n\n461\n00:22:20.735 --> 00:22:26.500\nthat's 100% of the CPU of my\nhost is now tied to this one VM.\n\n462\n00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.810\nNo other VM is gonna be able to function.\n\n463\n00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.060\nJust this one VM, so\nI've gotta be careful there.\n\n464\n00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:37.760\nI've gotta balance my virtual processors\nand my physical processors, right?\n\n465\n00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.890\nAnd if I'm doing video encoding,\nI might actually be better off doing\n\n466\n00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.310\nphysical servers than\ndoing something like this,\n\n467\n00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.850\ncuz you can get a hardware encoder\nboards that accelerate things.\n\n468\n00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.260\nYou can't have that in a VM,\n\n469\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.780\nthat might be better off there\noutside of a virtualization.\n\n470\n00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:54.280\nBut if I've got a domain controller, I\nmight choose to give it two VCPUs just so\n\n471\n00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.830\nit can take advantage\nof more than one core.\n\n472\n00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.290\nRight, so\nit can do multi threaded applications and\n\n473\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.020\nspread them across those cores.\n\n474\n00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:05.150\nBut I might not want to set\na reserve at all, right.\n\n475\n00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.400\nI might want to do a virtual\nmachine reserve of zero.\n\n476\n00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.810\nAnd just say look, if there\nhappens to be two cores available,\n\n477\n00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.000\nyou can use as much as there.\n\n478\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.200\nBut if there isn't,\nyou just grab what you can get, right?\n\n479\n00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.360\nI don't necessarily want\nto set a reservation here.\n\n480\n00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.260\nBecause a reservation is hard.\n\n481\n00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:21.960\nIt sets it aside.\n\n482\n00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.155\nNobody else can use it.\n\n483\n00:23:23.155 --> 00:23:27.485\nIf I reserve, two CPUs,\n50% of my processing resources, and\n\n484\n00:23:27.485 --> 00:23:30.966\nthen I don't use it,\nnobody else can use it either.\n\n485\n00:23:30.966 --> 00:23:31.900\nI've got it.\n\n486\n00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.360\nIt's reserved for me.\n\n487\n00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.600\nBe careful with reservations.\n\n488\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.680\nIf it's just a spike type event, then in\nthose scenarios you don't want to set\n\n489\n00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.940\na reservation cuz you'll\nbe able to spike already.\n\n490\n00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.790\nAnd instead you'll want to set a weight.\n\n491\n00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:50.030\nA weight is like a priority that says,\nhey, I need to spike.\n\n492\n00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.275\nAnd when I spike, I'm more important\nthan somebody else, and so\n\n493\n00:23:53.275 --> 00:23:55.345\nI get access to the CPU over them, right?\n\n494\n00:23:55.345 --> 00:23:58.246\nAnd with the weight, it's normally the\nhigher number is the one that's preferred.\n\n495\n00:23:58.246 --> 00:24:01.669\nBut check your vendor documentation,\ncuz it can be different for some vendors.\n\n496\n00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:03.275\nBut it's normally a higher number wins.\n\n497\n00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:07.175\nSo if I've got a weight of 100 and\nsomebody else has a weight of 50,\n\n498\n00:24:07.175 --> 00:24:11.344\nwhen I ask for CPU, I'm gonna get it,\nand they're gonna have to wait on me.\n\n499\n00:24:11.344 --> 00:24:13.886\nAnd when they ask for CPU,\nif there's nobody with a higher weight,\n\n500\n00:24:13.886 --> 00:24:14.564\nthey'll get it.\n\n501\n00:24:14.564 --> 00:24:15.504\nAnd they can take advantage of that.\n\n502\n00:24:15.504 --> 00:24:20.493\nSo user reservation, when you want to hard\nallocate these resources, they are tied\n\n503\n00:24:20.493 --> 00:24:25.294\nto this VM, and that's it, use a weight\nwhen you want it to be a little more soft.\n\n504\n00:24:25.294 --> 00:24:27.904\nThat we get priority, but\nwe're not reserving it all the time.\n\n505\n00:24:27.904 --> 00:24:29.997\nOther people can use those resources.\n\n506\n00:24:29.997 --> 00:24:32.317\nAnd you can throttle other machines too.\n\n507\n00:24:32.317 --> 00:24:35.624\nYou got these virtual machine limits where\nI might say, I've got a file server, and\n\n508\n00:24:35.624 --> 00:24:37.734\nI want it to be able to spike and\nstuff when it needs it.\n\n509\n00:24:37.734 --> 00:24:41.054\nBut I'm gonna cap it at\n80% of my resources.\n\n510\n00:24:41.054 --> 00:24:44.922\nI always wanna leave a little bit extra\navailable to make sure my host OS\n\n511\n00:24:44.922 --> 00:24:48.084\ncan operate, and\nmy other VMs can get a word in edgewise.\n\n512\n00:24:48.084 --> 00:24:50.718\nVersus if this guy was\nhaving that full access, so\n\n513\n00:24:50.718 --> 00:24:53.440\nyou can set these limits in place.\n\n514\n00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.696\nI have seen some virtualization software\nwhere it'll actually show your cores and\n\n515\n00:24:56.696 --> 00:24:59.670\nyou can check them off, and say these\nare the cores this VM is allowed to use,\n\n516\n00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.223\nyou can get really specific like that.\n\n517\n00:25:01.223 --> 00:25:02.103\nBut it creates two challenges.\n\n518\n00:25:02.103 --> 00:25:04.623\nOne, you run out of\nresources a lot faster.\n\n519\n00:25:04.623 --> 00:25:08.229\nAnd two, if you have a virtual machine\nthat can fail over from host to host to\n\n520\n00:25:08.229 --> 00:25:11.836\nhost, if you've got a clustered\nenvironment, well, you've gotta have\n\n521\n00:25:11.836 --> 00:25:15.353\na similar processor configuration on\neach of the hosts that you jump to.\n\n522\n00:25:15.353 --> 00:25:17.990\nSo that it can make sure that\nit does that same reservation or\n\n523\n00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.486\nthe same waiting when it jumps\nover to a different host.\n\n524\n00:25:20.486 --> 00:25:22.646\nAll stuff to keep in mind.\n\n525\n00:25:22.646 --> 00:25:23.366\n>> Very good.\n\n526\n00:25:23.366 --> 00:25:24.886\nSo we've looked at memory.\n\n527\n00:25:24.886 --> 00:25:27.006\nWe've got to have memory,\nwe gotta have CPU resources.\n\n528\n00:25:27.006 --> 00:25:32.366\nNow, one of the things that we also\nhave here is the storage aspect.\n\n529\n00:25:32.366 --> 00:25:34.566\nWe have data that needs to be stored and\nneeds to be retrieved.\n\n530\n00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:35.846\nNow, Don, I'm looking at the time here.\n\n531\n00:25:35.846 --> 00:25:37.455\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm not sure,\n\n532\n00:25:37.455 --> 00:25:39.486\nis that something you wanna save for\na part two?\n\n533\n00:25:39.486 --> 00:25:42.453\n>> Yeah, let's take storage, and\nwe haven't talked about network yet.\n\n534\n00:25:42.453 --> 00:25:44.953\nLet's take storage and network and\nmove them off to a part two.\n\n535\n00:25:44.953 --> 00:25:47.978\nAnd let me wrap this one\nup by saying memory and\n\n536\n00:25:47.978 --> 00:25:51.173\nCPU are the two that you\nreally have to focus on.\n\n537\n00:25:51.173 --> 00:25:53.413\nNetwork and\nstorage are easy to fix after the fact.\n\n538\n00:25:53.413 --> 00:25:55.403\nMemory and\nCPU are hard to fix after the fact.\n\n539\n00:25:55.403 --> 00:25:59.003\nThey're easy to fix on the VM,\nbut on the physical host,\n\n540\n00:25:59.003 --> 00:26:03.803\nif you wanna add CPUs to a physical host,\nit's really, really difficult.\n\n541\n00:26:03.803 --> 00:26:07.193\nYou really have to order it with\nthose CPUs or buy an all new host.\n\n542\n00:26:07.193 --> 00:26:10.136\nIf you have an empty socket in\nyour system, which is pretty rare,\n\n543\n00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:12.343\nbuying a compatible CPU\nis really challenging.\n\n544\n00:26:12.343 --> 00:26:13.723\nIt's hard to fix after the fact.\n\n545\n00:26:13.723 --> 00:26:15.083\nMemory's the same way.\n\n546\n00:26:15.083 --> 00:26:16.523\nI have to go and buy more memory.\n\n547\n00:26:16.523 --> 00:26:19.710\nAnd it might be that 'I've filled\nall the memory banks in my system.\n\n548\n00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:24.523\nSo maybe, let's say I've got eight.\n\n549\n00:26:24.523 --> 00:26:25.663\nI should pick easier math for\nthese things.\n\n550\n00:26:25.663 --> 00:26:29.132\nLet's say I have 8 2 gig sticks of RAM,\nso I've got 16 gigs,\n\n551\n00:26:29.132 --> 00:26:30.950\nand I wanna go to 32 gigs of RAM.\n\n552\n00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.976\nWell, I need to take those eight sticks\nand throw them in the trash, and\n\n553\n00:26:33.976 --> 00:26:36.253\nget eight four gig sticks of RAM and\nput them in there.\n\n554\n00:26:36.253 --> 00:26:38.753\nSo I just wasted memory to upgrade.\n\n555\n00:26:38.753 --> 00:26:40.893\nIt's hard to change these after the fact.\n\n556\n00:26:40.893 --> 00:26:44.303\nSo you wanna make sure you plan ahead for\nthat.\n\n557\n00:26:44.303 --> 00:26:50.023\nDeploy the hosts that have the resources\nyou need and then constant monitoring.\n\n558\n00:26:50.023 --> 00:26:54.932\nYou've got to monitor your servers\nbecause you might have specced everything\n\n559\n00:26:54.932 --> 00:26:59.182\nout perfect on day 1, but\non day 100, your needs have changed.\n\n560\n00:26:59.182 --> 00:27:02.470\nOn day 1,000,\nyour needs have changed even more, and so\n\n561\n00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.393\nnow you need different\nresources that are available.\n\n562\n00:27:05.393 --> 00:27:08.156\nBut just as far as our best practices go,\nin production environments,\n\n563\n00:27:08.156 --> 00:27:09.500\nyou wanna do static assignments.\n\n564\n00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:14.424\nStatic assignments of memory, static\nassignments of your virtual CPU resources\n\n565\n00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:17.933\nto make sure you can count on\nthose resources being there.\n\n566\n00:27:17.933 --> 00:27:21.181\nAnd then in lab environments, you can take\nadvantage of all the bells and whistles,\n\n567\n00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:23.213\nthe dynamic memory, TPS,\nall those other things.\n\n568\n00:27:23.213 --> 00:27:24.942\nThey are great when they\nwork in production, but\n\n569\n00:27:24.942 --> 00:27:26.343\nit is not something you wanna count on.\n\n570\n00:27:26.343 --> 00:27:27.183\nYou don't wanna rely on it.\n\n571\n00:27:27.183 --> 00:27:30.538\nYou wanna make sure that your host has\nthe resources to match the VMs, and\n\n572\n00:27:30.538 --> 00:27:32.083\nit's able to support your load.\n\n573\n00:27:32.083 --> 00:27:33.363\n>> Very good, and thank you for that, Don.\n\n574\n00:27:33.363 --> 00:27:36.595\nAnd pay attention now out there cuz when\nit comes down to is with the elasticity\n\n575\n00:27:36.595 --> 00:27:38.584\nand the on-demand nature\nof cloud computing,\n\n576\n00:27:38.584 --> 00:27:40.572\nvery easy to spin up some\nvirtual machines, but\n\n577\n00:27:40.572 --> 00:27:43.523\nit's also easy to break the bank too,\nand do some misconfiguration.\n\n578\n00:27:43.523 --> 00:27:44.903\nDon, got anything else for us on this one?\n\n579\n00:27:44.903 --> 00:27:45.883\n>> I think that's it.\n\n580\n00:27:45.883 --> 00:27:49.235\nDavid did actually mention something\nin the chatroom that's worthwhile,\n\n581\n00:27:49.235 --> 00:27:51.340\nnot that all his comments\naren't worthwhile.\n\n582\n00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.226\nBut that when you get your CPUs, it's not\njust about core count that we also have\n\n583\n00:27:55.226 --> 00:27:58.310\ncache inside, the L1, L2,\nL3 cache that are part of CPUs.\n\n584\n00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.690\nAnd the more of that cache you have,\n\n585\n00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.670\nthe better performance you\nget out of those cores.\n\n586\n00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:05.487\nSo not all cores are created equal,\nnot all CPUs are created equal, and as you\n\n587\n00:28:05.487 --> 00:28:09.453\nbounce from host to host, you can get\nvarious performance profiles there too.\n\n588\n00:28:09.453 --> 00:28:11.933\nSo it's just more stuff that we\nneed to monitor in those systems.\n\n589\n00:28:11.933 --> 00:28:12.813\n>> All right, very good.\n\n590\n00:28:12.813 --> 00:28:16.143\nAnd it looks like we've come to the end of\nanother exciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n591\n00:28:16.143 --> 00:28:18.003\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign out here.\n\n592\n00:28:18.003 --> 00:28:19.263\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n593\n00:28:19.263 --> 00:28:20.163\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n594\n00:28:20.163 --> 00:28:24.428\n>> And we'll

00:00:17.360\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.050\nwe're gonna be moving along\nin our Cloud Plus series,\n\n5\n00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.110\nand we're actually coming back with\na part two of allocating resources.\n\n6\n00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.150\nThat's right, in the first part,\nwe talked way too much, or\n\n7\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.490\nat least enough to fill up\nthe part two of this side.\n\n8\n00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.460\nAnd, we got Don Pezet to help us out.\n\n9\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.760\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.040\n>> I'm doing great, Wes,\nready to wrap this turkey up, right?\n\n11\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.660\nSo, we've talked about allocating\nresources in the first episode.\n\n12\n00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.730\nWe tackled CPU, we tackled RAM.\n\n13\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.620\nWe still have a storage network\nto talk about, right, so\n\n14\n00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.070\nadditional resources there.\n\n15\n00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.400\nAnd we'll find that there's a common\ntheme that runs through this,\n\n16\n00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.310\nthat we have a dynamic type of allocation\nand a static type of allocation.\n\n17\n00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.960\nAnd we just have to remember all\nthe different pieces that add up that then\n\n18\n00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.500\nconsume our full set of resources.\n\n19\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.930\nSo we're just gonna continue on with that,\nrun through those.\n\n20\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.030\nAnd then at the end of the episode,\nhopefully I won't ramble on too long cuz I\n\n21\n00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.840\nwanna talk a little about self\nservice portals, and some of the other\n\n22\n00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.070\nlittle issues that we can bump into when\nwe let non-admins into our accounts.\n\n23\n00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.220\nI know it sounds crazy,\nbut it does happen.\n\n24\n00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.400\nSo we'll talk about that\na little later in the episode.\n\n25\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.615\nWell, Well,\nlet's kick things off with storage.\n\n26\n00:01:17.615 --> 00:01:18.155\nRight?\n\n27\n00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:22.165\nStorage at first glance storage seems\nlike a really easy thing to meter out.\n\n28\n00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:24.525\nYou're like,\nwell I've got a bunch of VM's.\n\n29\n00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:27.095\nHere's the hard drive sizes they've got I\njust need to make sure I have that much\n\n30\n00:01:27.095 --> 00:01:28.135\nstorage and I'm done.\n\n31\n00:01:28.135 --> 00:01:30.185\nAnd a lot of people think that way and\n\n32\n00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:34.505\nyou kind of end up being in an area\nwhere Disk IO becomes your bottleneck.\n\n33\n00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:36.395\nDisk IO is always your bottleneck anyway,\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:39.400\nBecause it's the slowest\ncomponent in your computer.\n\n35\n00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.840\nIf you've got spinning disks, there is\nnothing else slower in your computer.\n\n36\n00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.780\nIf you have SSD, it's a heck of a lot\nbetter, but it's still slower than RAM and\n\n37\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.670\nCPU.\n\n38\n00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.790\nIt may well be faster than your network,\ndepending on the type of\n\n39\n00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.220\nnetwork that you have, some network\nbecomes you bottleneck, right?\n\n40\n00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.920\nBut storage almost always is an area\nwhere we have bottlenecks, and\n\n41\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.750\njust because I have a one terabyte drive\n\n42\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.790\ndoesn't mean that I can fire up ten\nVM's with 100 GB of storage each, right?\n\n43\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.310\nBecause if all ten VM's,\n\n44\n00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.420\nyeah they'll be able to store their\ndata there's enough room for it, but\n\n45\n00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.080\nif all ten VM's try and access their\ndata at the same time what happens?\n\n46\n00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.800\nThat one disk can only\ndo one thing at a time.\n\n47\n00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.650\nEven in SSD well it might be\na multi-channel SSD I guess,\n\n48\n00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.270\nsome of them can do as many as four\nthings at a time, but that's your limit.\n\n49\n00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.250\nIf I got ten VMs all trying\nto do something at once.\n\n50\n00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.340\nI hit that limit and\nmy queue starts to build up.\n\n51\n00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.360\nAnd in the performance monitoring episodes\nI'll show you guys how to monitor that\n\n52\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.120\nqueue and see when that's happening.\n\n53\n00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.820\nAnd the simplest solution\nis to add more storage.\n\n54\n00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.550\nRight, add more drives.\n\n55\n00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.326\nIf I need 10 TB of storage I could do,\nno wait, that's a bad one.\n\n56\n00:02:43.326 --> 00:02:44.870\n[LAUGH] Let's pick works better.\n\n57\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.180\nIf I need 8 TB of storage,\nI can get two 4 TB drives and\n\n58\n00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.160\nstripe them, and there we go.\n\n59\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.700\n4 TB drives, they're on the market,\n\n60\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.280\nyou can buy them pretty easy,\nthere's my 8 TB of storage.\n\n61\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.370\nBut I've only got two\ndrives doing the work.\n\n62\n00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.730\nI could get eight, one TB drives,\n\n63\n00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.220\nand now I've got eight drives doing\nthe work, I can do eight things at once,\n\n64\n00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.320\nversus two four terrabyte drives\nI can only do two things at once.\n\n65\n00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.700\nSo those are the things that we\nneed to take into consideration.\n\n66\n00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.520\nIt's not just about the storage size,\nit's also about redundancy,\n\n67\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.970\nresiliency and throughput.\n\n68\n00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.600\nHow much can we do at any given time?\n\n69\n00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.670\nThose really key principles that\nwe need to be familiar with.\n\n70\n00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.610\nWe start to allocate storage to our VM's\nand we attach that storage to our hosts.\n\n71\n00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.800\n>> I was sitting here thinking this was\nstarting to become, in this episode,\n\n72\n00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.990\nwhat's Don's mathematical challenge for\ntoday?\n\n73\n00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.620\nYou know, and I know that when we're\ntalking about production side we're all,\n\n74\n00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.190\nlet me tell you a little\nbit about what happened on\n\n75\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.030\nthe client's side virtualization and\nlabs for me, Don.\n\n76\n00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.960\nYou know I have a machine at the house and\nI did exactly what you said.\n\n77\n00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.690\nI took all of my virtual machines and,\nagain, remember it's a type 2 hypervisor,\n\n78\n00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.020\nso little bit different than\na production environment, but\n\n79\n00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.700\nyou could see how the production\nenvironment would be even worse.\n\n80\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.300\nTook all of my virtual machines, put them\non a one TB drive and I tell you what,\n\n81\n00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.500\ngo to launch I don't know five or\nsix of these virtual machines up.\n\n82\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.780\nI've got plenty of memory, so\nI'm not worried about memory.\n\n83\n00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.190\nAnd man, every one of those machines\nwould just come to a crawl.\n\n84\n00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.210\nSo what I ended up having to do, and I\nthought it was better, I could go out and\n\n85\n00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.625\nget two cheaper solid state drives.\n\n86\n00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:15.530\nNot a lot of space on them,\nonly eight giggers or so.\n\n87\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.080\nBut then I would allocate\nthe hard drives for\n\n88\n00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.000\none virtual machine to one\n80 GB solid state drive.\n\n89\n00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.100\nAnd then I'd allocate to another\n80 GB solid state drive.\n\n90\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.060\nAnd now, every time the virtual machines\nspin up, I've got two different disks\n\n91\n00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.570\nthat are running, so, I started to\nsee a little bit better performance.\n\n92\n00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.840\nNow, I can only imagine, Don,\nin a production environment, where you're\n\n93\n00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.180\nreally working these machines,\nyou're gonna need something like that.\n\n94\n00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.320\n>> Absolutely, and so\nwe've gotta think about it.\n\n95\n00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.520\nWe've gotta think about disk group.\n\n96\n00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.990\nWhen you buy a new disk, written\nright on the front, it will say like,\n\n97\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.400\nthis is a SATA 3 disk that\nhas 6 GB of throughput.\n\n98\n00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.810\nGreat, I can move 6 GB of\ndata through that thing.\n\n99\n00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.000\nThat starts to set the bar of what I can\nmeasure to see how I can move, right?\n\n100\n00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.610\nSame thing with SAS drives.\n\n101\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.410\nSAS drives you can get\nup to 12 GB right now.\n\n102\n00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.330\nYou get those fiber channel SAS\ndrives that are they're pretty sweet.\n\n103\n00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.450\nBut, the drives aren't\nthe only consideration.\n\n104\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.630\nLet me show you a little diagram\nthat I used in another episode.\n\n105\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.840\nThis is a very simplistic view of a SAN,\n\n106\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.480\nbut it gets my point across that\nwe might have physical hosts.\n\n107\n00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.440\nLet's say that this is VMHOST1 and\nthen I've got VMHOST2 and\n\n108\n00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.350\nwho knows, maybe I've got some\nphysical servers attached to this SAN.\n\n109\n00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.980\nSo each one has a connection to the SAN,\nand not necessarily directly to the SAN.\n\n110\n00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.650\nWe normally go through\na fiber switch like this one.\n\n111\n00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.870\nLet's think about all the components\nthat are involved in this communication.\n\n112\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.930\nI'm talking about disks and disk speed.\n\n113\n00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.090\nSo down here, when I get these disks,\nI've gotta think about their speed.\n\n114\n00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.870\nIf I've got 12 GB SAS drives in here.\n\n115\n00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.930\nThey're nice and fast.\n\n116\n00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.430\nBut at the end of the day, this virtual\nmachine host, they might have ten VMs on\n\n117\n00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.480\nit, that all need to access that storage,\nand it's not directly accessing the drive.\n\n118\n00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.260\nSo, it's great that drive is 12 GB,\nthat's wonderful.\n\n119\n00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.510\nBut, what about the switch\nthat's in between it?\n\n120\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.610\nWhat about the HBA that's on the SAN\nthat this network cable is plugged into?\n\n121\n00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.130\nWhat about the HBA that's in my virtual\nmachine host that it's plugged into?\n\n122\n00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:19.020\nThis HBA right here plugged into VMHOST1,\nthat thing might only be 12 GB.\n\n123\n00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.310\nIf it's set up for\n\n124\n00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.360\na 12 GB SAN, then it's gonna have 12\nGB of throughput on that one HBA.\n\n125\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.870\nThat means that any one VM\ncould hit 12 GB of speed.\n\n126\n00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.560\nBut if I've got five VMs,\nthey're all sharing that link.\n\n127\n00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.645\nAnd so, if there's even two hosts\ntalking or two VMs talking at once.\n\n128\n00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:42.735\nThey're gonna divide that up, and\nthey're not gonna get 12 GB, right?\n\n129\n00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:47.755\nSo all of my virtual machines are having\nto share that HBA, or if it's an iSCSI\n\n130\n00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:52.620\nSAN, they're having to share that iSCSI\nconnection to get to the storage, right?\n\n131\n00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.930\nAnd so that becomes a bottleneck for\n\n132\n00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.260\nthis one host, not even considering\nall the other hosts, right, Wes?\n\n133\n00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.840\n>> Yeah, this reminds me coming\nout of A+ and NET+, Donn.\n\n134\n00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.900\nAnd help me out with this one.\n\n135\n00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.030\nThis looks like the same thing when we\nsay contention-based media access, right?\n\n136\n00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.940\nWe've got a struggle going on here.\n\n137\n00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.470\nMaybe not a struggle, but\nwe're definitely dividing that.\n\n138\n00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.090\nOr when you talk about, for instance, an\nISP and shared bandwidth with your cable\n\n139\n00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.050\nproviders, you only get your\nlittle piece of the pie.\n\n140\n00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.920\nAnd now it could cause\nperformance degradation?\n\n141\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.220\n>> Yeah, and it's not quite the same\nas media access contingent.\n\n142\n00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.120\n>> Right.\n>> Where, like in an ethernet network,\n\n143\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.940\nwhere only one person can talk a link\nat a time or you get collisions.\n\n144\n00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.870\nIt's not like that here\ncuz we have the LUNs and\n\n145\n00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.890\nyou get parallel type communications.\n\n146\n00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.880\nBut you do have that competition for\nbandwidth.\n\n147\n00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.070\nThere's only so much bandwidth that\ncan go on one of these links, and\n\n148\n00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.700\nyou can exceed it.\n\n149\n00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.370\nAnd it's easy to plan for\nthat on the hosts.\n\n150\n00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.720\nIt's harder on the SAN.\n\n151\n00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.410\nThis SAN has two connections.\n\n152\n00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.420\nLet's say they're 12 GB each.\n\n153\n00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.480\nSo there's 24 GB of bandwidth on the SAN.\n\n154\n00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.463\nWell, if I have each of these hosts\nwith a 12 GB adapter, that's a lot more,\n\n155\n00:07:56.463 --> 00:07:57.228\nisn't it?\n\n156\n00:07:57.228 --> 00:08:00.083\nThat's 24 GB, no, it's 48 GB.\n\n157\n00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:00.606\nThere it is.\n\n158\n00:08:00.606 --> 00:08:01.663\nDon's math is challenged today.\n\n159\n00:08:01.663 --> 00:08:04.959\n>> I told you.\n>> So, I got 48 GB potential.\n\n160\n00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:07.613\nOf traffic that's gonna\nbe crossing those lines,\n\n161\n00:08:07.613 --> 00:08:11.370\nverses the 24 that I've got down here,\nbecause of these links.\n\n162\n00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.370\nAnd when you buy a SAN,\nthe two gig stuff is pretty old,\n\n163\n00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.650\nyou don't see that anymore so much.\n\n164\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.180\nBut the four gig is still\non sale quite a bit.\n\n165\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.670\nThe eight gig is out there,\nthat's usually the best price point.\n\n166\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.260\nAnd the 12 gig, is the fast stuff.\n\n167\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.610\nSo you can get that, but\nyou may need more than one connection or\n\n168\n00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.570\nyou may need more than one SAN if you know\nyou're going to be exceeding those values.\n\n169\n00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.670\nNow what are your values gonna be?\n\n170\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.880\nUnfortunately, I don't know.\n\n171\n00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.410\nIf you have a database server,\nthese values could be really high.\n\n172\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.140\nDatabases can push a lot of reads and\nwrites.\n\n173\n00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.870\nBut you might have a web server\nthat caches the web page and\n\n174\n00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.320\nit rarely ever touches these\ndisks on the back end.\n\n175\n00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.210\nIn fact then,\nthe disks only really get used for\n\n176\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.070\ncluster fail over which you\nmight not even be doing.\n\n177\n00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:51.030\nYou might be load balancing across VMs and\nyour disk IO is negligible.\n\n178\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.160\nIn those cases,\nyou may have plenty of bandwidth here.\n\n179\n00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.460\nYou've got to measure\nthe bandwidth of your host.\n\n180\n00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.198\nHow much storage bandwidth that they need?\n\n181\n00:08:58.198 --> 00:09:01.090\nHow many reads and\nwrites per second are they performing?\n\n182\n00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.500\nAnd you've gotta add that up for\neach of the VMs and\n\n183\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.410\neach of the hosts to see if you exceed\nit anywhere along the lines, right?\n\n184\n00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:14.320\nThere's the physical drives,\nthere's the storage controller in the SAN,\n\n185\n00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.150\nThere's the HBAs in the SAN that\nconnect to the fiber switch.\n\n186\n00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.880\nThere's the fiber switch itself,\n\n187\n00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.130\nwhich has a back plane that has\na certain performance point.\n\n188\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.660\nThen you've got the links to the hosts and\nthe HBAs in the hosts.\n\n189\n00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.820\nAll of those points could be\npotential bottle necks and\n\n190\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.620\nI've got to add up my storage all along\nthose links to figure out what I've got.\n\n191\n00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.840\nNow we can over allocate, you are going\nto over allocate, that happens.\n\n192\n00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.710\nVery few people have\na true non blocking SAN\n\n193\n00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.150\nwhere everybody has full\naccess to the resources.\n\n194\n00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.220\nYou normally have over allocation.\n\n195\n00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.120\nAnd that's okay as long as your systems\naren't butting up against each other.\n\n196\n00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.160\nIt goes back to that constant monitoring\nI keep saying over and over again.\n\n197\n00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.490\nThat you've gotta monitor your system and\nevaluate that.\n\n198\n00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:55.450\nAnd you might find that hey,\n\n199\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.590\nI've got a database server that just\nneeds a lot of reads and writes.\n\n200\n00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.890\nMaybe I'll move that off to its own SAN,\nor maybe I'll de-virtualize it.\n\n201\n00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.580\nI'll put it back to physical and give\nit its own direct attached storage, and\n\n202\n00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.360\nnow it doesn't interfere\nwith all these other guys.\n\n203\n00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.980\nSome hosts are not a good\nfit to be virtualized.\n\n204\n00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.700\nSometimes you just need to\nleave them as a host, but\n\n205\n00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.970\ninstead of converting them to a VM guest,\nright.\n\n206\n00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.340\nSo we've gotta make sure we evaluate that,\nbut that is a big issue.\n\n207\n00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.220\nAnd things like multipathing\ncan help with that.\n\n208\n00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.160\nIf I have more than one\npath to get to the SAN,\n\n209\n00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.640\nI could have two separate switches,\nI could have two HBAs in each of my hosts.\n\n210\n00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.420\nAnd now when Node 1 wants to go to\nthe SAN it's got two different ways\n\n211\n00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.170\nthat it can go there.\n\n212\n00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.410\nOver the orange network or\nover the red network, and\n\n213\n00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.690\nif it load balances, that's great.\n\n214\n00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:40.480\nWe get double the traffic, but if every\nnode is load balancing like that, if every\n\n215\n00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.410\nnode is doubling their bandwidth, how much\nbandwidth do I have up here on the SAN?\n\n216\n00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.350\nI might not have enough connections\nto be able to support that,\n\n217\n00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.800\nand I exceed the throughput of the SAN.\n\n218\n00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.105\nSo on storage, it's not just\nabout the size of the storage.\n\n219\n00:10:54.105 --> 00:10:57.430\n[LAUGH] It's not the size that matters,\nI guess.\n\n220\n00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:01.370\nBut the throughput, the amount of\ndata that we can get back and forth.\n\n221\n00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.327\nThis episode's gonna go\ndownhill if I let it, but\n\n222\n00:11:03.327 --> 00:11:06.507\nthe amount of throughput to go to that\nSAN, we've gotta keep that into account.\n\n223\n00:11:06.507 --> 00:11:09.821\nSame thing with direct attached storage,\nsame thing with ISCSI, really,\n\n224\n00:11:09.821 --> 00:11:11.170\nit's all the same.\n\n225\n00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.880\nYou have to think of all the different\ncomponents in your path, right, before you\n\n226\n00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.040\nget out there and allocate that stuff, so\ndefinitely things we need to think about.\n\n227\n00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.690\nThe transfer rates, the seek times,\n\n228\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.680\nthe read/write speed, the buffers on\nthe drives as they start to queue up.\n\n229\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.120\nThose buffers are only so large.\n\n230\n00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.104\nWe've gotta remember all those elements\nwhen we start planning out that storage.\n\n231\n00:11:29.104 --> 00:11:32.276\nAll right, the other thing I wanna\nmention is, there's some special\n\n232\n00:11:32.276 --> 00:11:36.030\ntechnologies that you might bump into\nwhen you deal with virtualization.\n\n233\n00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.300\nFor example, thin provisioning.\n\n234\n00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.720\nJust because I give a virtual machine an\n80 GB hard drive doesn't mean it's gonna\n\n235\n00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.150\nuse all 80 GB, and so, just like with RAM.\n\n236\n00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.340\nWe can thin provision, and\n\n237\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.480\nwe can give them the very small\ndrive that can grow as they need it.\n\n238\n00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.350\nI talked about that in the storage\nepisode, so I won't harp on it here.\n\n239\n00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.340\nIt's fine in test and labs.\n\n240\n00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.520\nIt's not fine in production because every\ntime it grows it's a performance hit.\n\n241\n00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.970\nSo you don't wanna use that in production.\n\n242\n00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.070\nThat's kind of a best practice on that.\n\n243\n00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.680\nAnd then another thing is if you\nhave a database server, for example,\n\n244\n00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.290\nthat needs extensive reads and writes.\n\n245\n00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.620\ninstead of giving them\nvirtual hard drives,\n\n246\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.010\nyou can map physical hard drives to a VM,\nit is possible.\n\n247\n00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.240\nNot every software does it but\nmany of them will.\n\n248\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.170\nFor example, let me take this\nhyper view server for example.\n\n249\n00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.660\nI have this web server that I whipped\nup in part one really quick, and\n\n250\n00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.140\nI just accepted all the defaults and\nwhipped through it,\n\n251\n00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.628\nsee how it has a hard drive here.\n\n252\n00:12:27.628 --> 00:12:30.110\nAnd it's ITPROTV-WEB01.vhdx, right.\n\n253\n00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.580\nIt's a virtual hard drive.\n\n254\n00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.140\nThat vhdx is stored on\na hard drive somewhere,\n\n255\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.450\nhopefully on a SAN, and\nthat's where it's stored.\n\n256\n00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.350\nSo I've really got two hard drives,\n\n257\n00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.260\nthe virtual hard drive and\nthe physical drive that it sits on.\n\n258\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.720\nBut if I know I'm gonna have\nextensive reads and writes,\n\n259\n00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.380\nI might want to give it\nexclusive access to a drive.\n\n260\n00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.920\nSo when I go to add hardware, and\nadd a drive, well, I can go under SCSI,\n\n261\n00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.650\nI can choose to add a hard drive and\nI need to add and when I go to add it,\n\n262\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.510\nthe default is to add a virtual disk but\nlook at this option right here.\n\n263\n00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.040\nA physical disk.\n\n264\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.380\nI could have a physical disk in this\nhost and I could map it to the VM.\n\n265\n00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.360\nNow it gets exclusive read and\nwrite throughput to that disk,\n\n266\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.660\nno one else can touch it.\n\n267\n00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.930\nSo on a positive side we\nget great performance.\n\n268\n00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.360\nOn a negative side there's\nlittle bit of a problem, right.\n\n269\n00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.170\nLet's talk about clusters.\n\n270\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.620\nIf these are clustered hypervisors and I\nwant my virtual machine to be able to fail\n\n271\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.190\nover from Node 1 to Node 2\nto Node 3 to Node 4, right.\n\n272\n00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.490\nJust failed over or\nmove it around as needed.\n\n273\n00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:33.500\nIf my SQL server is bound to a physical\ndrive on Node 4, can it move?\n\n274\n00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.700\nNo, it's stuck.\n\n275\n00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.940\nIt's stuck right there.\n\n276\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.710\nWe've always gotta be aware when it\ncomes to binding physical hardware.\n\n277\n00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.340\nAnd so that's why you'll find\nwhere aside from storage,\n\n278\n00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.400\nmost type one hypervisers don't\nsupport any other type of hardware.\n\n279\n00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.710\nStorage is the only thing that\nyou can physically map to the VM,\n\n280\n00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.190\nand it's because of\nthese performance needs.\n\n281\n00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.180\nIf you start dealing with type two\nhypervisors like desktop stuff.\n\n282\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.925\nIn fact I'm running, where is it?\n\n283\n00:13:57.925 --> 00:13:59.350\nVMware Fusion here.\n\n284\n00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.770\nSo VMware fusion is\na type two hypervisor and\n\n285\n00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.190\nwhen I create a VM in this thing\nI can take one of my servers.\n\n286\n00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.093\nMaybe not that one,\nlet me take this server.\n\n287\n00:14:07.093 --> 00:14:12.130\nAnd when I go into the server settings\nnot only can I map physical drives right.\n\n288\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:16.350\nIf I go to add a disk and I choose\na hard disk, when I go to add that disk,\n\n289\n00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.830\nit'll give me the option\nto map a physical one.\n\n290\n00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.950\nActually, it might not give it to me\ncuz I don't have any extra physical\n\n291\n00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.120\ndisks lying around, so it's, yeah,\nit's not gonna let me map one of those.\n\n292\n00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.500\nBut it also lets me map other things,\nlike serial ports, and\n\n293\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.890\nparallel ports, and\nstuff like that, right?\n\n294\n00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.660\nSo if I go back here and\nI take a look at like, USB and\n\n295\n00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.750\nBluetooth I can map USB devices\ninto this virtual machine.\n\n296\n00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:44.120\nSo I might have a USB hard drive or\na network adapter, a dongle, a mouse or\n\n297\n00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.640\nwhatever and\nI could physically map it to this VM.\n\n298\n00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.760\nThat's great here in a type 2\nhypervisor just on my laptop.\n\n299\n00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.850\nBut in a cluster, it goes right back\nto the point I just made a moment ago.\n\n300\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:15:00.620\nIf I map a USB port on Node 1 to my VM,\nmy VM is now tied to Node 1.\n\n301\n00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.285\nAnd if node one fails,\nI can't jump to another node,\n\n302\n00:15:03.285 --> 00:15:05.370\ncuz that USB device is not there, right?\n\n303\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.210\nIt's missing, it's just not present.\n\n304\n00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.040\nAnd so that is a concern.\n\n305\n00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.900\nOn the exam, you might see them\nmention USB ports, that's one.\n\n306\n00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.330\nSerial ports and parallel ports,\nlike, for printers.\n\n307\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.420\nThose are other ones.\n\n308\n00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.220\nI don't know,\ndoes VMWare Fusion give me those?\n\n309\n00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.220\nLet's see.\n\n310\n00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.610\nJust a quick scan.\n\n311\n00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:21.770\nI'm not seeing serial ports.\n\n312\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:22.870\nLet me see if I can add one.\n\n313\n00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.950\nThere it is, yeah.\n\n314\n00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.020\nSo I can add a serial port.\n\n315\n00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:29.000\nMaybe I have an external modem I want to\nattach to a VM, or a parallel port for\n\n316\n00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.730\na printer of some sort.\n\n317\n00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.550\nThose types of things bind me to physical\nhardware, and they limit my mobility.\n\n318\n00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.530\nSo the same thing goes for storage,\nwhich is why I bring it up here.\n\n319\n00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:41.410\nIf I bind a physical drive to a VM,\nI lose my mobility.\n\n320\n00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.390\nI lose my portability for that VM, and\ndefinitely something to be aware of there.\n\n321\n00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.180\nAll right,\nI think that's all there is for storage.\n\n322\n00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.390\nI don't want to ramble on too long,\nit actually went on longer than I wanted.\n\n323\n00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.641\nNetwork is the other one.\n\n324\n00:15:52.641 --> 00:15:56.182\nNetwork is probably the easiest, because\nwe can always fix it after the fact.\n\n325\n00:15:56.182 --> 00:15:58.783\nIf you're running on a network bandwidth,\nwhat do you do?\n\n326\n00:15:58.783 --> 00:16:01.523\nYou either get a fast adapter or\nyou add more adapters.\n\n327\n00:16:01.523 --> 00:16:03.078\nIt's easy to add more adapters.\n\n328\n00:16:03.078 --> 00:16:04.844\nAnd in the networking episodes,\n\n329\n00:16:04.844 --> 00:16:07.880\nwe talked a little bit about\nbonding adapters together.\n\n330\n00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.960\nSo, if I have two adapters that are 1\nGB each, I can bond them together.\n\n331\n00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.680\nNow I've got 2 GB.\n\n332\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.230\nAnd if I can add a third and a fourth and\nso on, and bond them together,\n\n333\n00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.350\nand start getting bigger and bigger\nadapters, bigger and bigger connections.\n\n334\n00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.500\nI might need to do dedicated connections.\n\n335\n00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.010\nIf I have a file server, for example,\n\n336\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.200\nI know a file server's gonna\nuse a ton of bandwidth.\n\n337\n00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.520\nAnd so I might physically map one adapter\nstraight to that virtual machine.\n\n338\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.650\nIt gets a dedicated adapter,\nit's got all the bandwidth it needs.\n\n339\n00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.078\nAnd it won't interfere\nwith everybody else.\n\n340\n00:16:34.078 --> 00:16:38.540\nBut for non-bandwidth intensive things\nlike DNS servers, domain controllers,\n\n341\n00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.850\nDHCP, those guys I might just have\nthem all share the same link.\n\n342\n00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.670\nThey can share a link, it's fine, because\nthey're not using a ton of bandwidth.\n\n343\n00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.290\nBut we've got to monitor the bandwidth\nconsumption of each node, each virtual\n\n344\n00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:54.080\nmachine, to make sure that we're not over\nallocating the resources that we've got.\n\n345\n00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.830\nThat if all of my VMs\nare trying to transfer data and\n\n346\n00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.780\nthey're competing against each other,\nit's gonna create a network bottleneck.\n\n347\n00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.520\nAnd so on networking it's\nvery similar to storage.\n\n348\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.000\nYou've got your network adapter,\nyou're got your switch,\n\n349\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.640\nyou've got the services on\nthe other end of that connection.\n\n350\n00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.240\nThose are all things that\nimpact your bandwidth.\n\n351\n00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.680\nBut the highest risk for bandwidth\non a virtualized server are VLANs.\n\n352\n00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.550\nThat when I start doing a trunked\nconnection to a virtual switch,\n\n353\n00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.290\nand I'm carrying more than one VLAN,\nthat can really cause some problems.\n\n354\n00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.210\nAnd so in the networking episode, I showed\nyou guys that when you setup a trunk,\n\n355\n00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.040\nyou can throttle which trunks or\nwhich VLANs cross that trunk.\n\n356\n00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.390\nAnd then you can assign\nvirtual machines to them.\n\n357\n00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.150\nIf you haven't already watched those\nepisodes, definitely check them out.\n\n358\n00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.100\nBut those are things that need\nto be a part of our plan.\n\n359\n00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.800\nThe best practice here is measure\nthe bandwidth that each of your virtual\n\n360\n00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.530\nmachine needs, and\nthen take that into calculation.\n\n361\n00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.830\nWhen you build up your\nvirtual machine host,\n\n362\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.210\nyou need to make sure you're able\nto support that level of bandwidth.\n\n363\n00:17:51.752 --> 00:17:54.090\nAll right so\ndid I miss anything on network.\n\n364\n00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.510\nI feel like I am missing something.\n\n365\n00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.280\nWe talked about the components,\nwe talked about dedicated nix,\n\n366\n00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.640\nI guess that's about it.\n\n367\n00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.030\nSo we just need to make sure we've\ngot that sufficient bandwidth.\n\n368\n00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.000\nSo storage and networking, I say that it's\nthe easiest to fix is after the fact,\n\n369\n00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.190\nbecause I can always add more hard drives,\nI can always add more network adapters.\n\n370\n00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.850\nAnd they're not even that expensive.\n\n371\n00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.430\nAdding more RAM,\nadding more CPUs, that's tough.\n\n372\n00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:13.360\nNo that's hard.\n\n373\n00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.730\nBut these two guys are pretty\neasy to fix after the fact.\n\n374\n00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.570\n>> Now Don,\nwhen it comes to the virtual machines, and\n\n375\n00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.370\nwhen you are allocating resources to them.\n\n376\n00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:25.733\nIs there a way that you can lock them\ndown to a specific set of resources or\n\n377\n00:18:25.733 --> 00:18:27.207\nmaybe even limit them?\n\n378\n00:18:27.207 --> 00:18:29.923\nSo maybe you don't have\nto worry about like for\n\n379\n00:18:29.923 --> 00:18:32.160\ninstance I would say dynamic memory.\n\n380\n00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.940\nI know you said don't use\nit in production, but\n\n381\n00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.260\nit could cause a problem because\nI could rely on a need to rely on\n\n382\n00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.090\nthat amount of RAM that's not\nthere when I really needed it.\n\n383\n00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.570\nSo do we have any techniques or\n\n384\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.840\ntechnologies that we can help to\ntry to at least limit that problem?\n\n385\n00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.210\n>> Absolutely.\nSo I can give you a true story right here.\n\n386\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.780\nI used to work for\nan organization where we had a dev team.\n\n387\n00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.980\nAnd the dev team needed to spin up\nsandbox servers all the time, right.\n\n388\n00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.640\nSo we had our production environment and\nthey'd wanna test something.\n\n389\n00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.670\nSo they'd spin up a sandbox server\nthat was a clone of production.\n\n390\n00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.220\nThey test something out,\nand see how it worked, and\n\n391\n00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.040\nthen when they were done with it\nthey would just throw it away,\n\n392\n00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.980\nand then they would provision\na new one when they needed it.\n\n393\n00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.420\nSo this happened all the time.\n\n394\n00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.150\nAnd the way that it used to work, was\nthey had to open up a help desk ticker.\n\n395\n00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.040\nSo whenever a developer needed a sandbox,\nthey'd do a support ticket and\n\n396\n00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.650\none of us would get the ticket and\nthen provision out their new environment.\n\n397\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.610\nWell our CIO said come on,\nthere's gotta be a way to automate that.\n\n398\n00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.210\nAnd so what we did is we put\nin a self-service portal.\n\n399\n00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:28.210\nA portal where those developers could\njust browse through the web page, and\n\n400\n00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.920\nsay create me a sandbox.\n\n401\n00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.110\nAnd it would whip them up a sandbox\nright then, dynamically, provision it.\n\n402\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.740\nAnd then they'd have access to it.\n\n403\n00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.180\nWell, what happened?\n\n404\n00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.540\nWithin the first week we started\nrunning out of resources.\n\n405\n00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.340\nAnd what was happening was,\n\n406\n00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.560\nthose developers would provision\nan environment and then leave it.\n\n407\n00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.380\nAnd then provision another one and\nleave it.\n\n408\n00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.380\nAnd provision another,\nthey'd start provisioning a bunch.\n\n409\n00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.190\nOr they'd say, boy,\nmy app is really running slow.\n\n410\n00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.280\nWhat if I add four more CPUs and\n8 GB more RAM?\n\n411\n00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.060\nNow it's running great!\n\n412\n00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.010\nThat's the SharePoint\nstyle of optimization,\n\n413\n00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.290\njust throw more resources at it.\n\n414\n00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.280\nBut the problem was the developers\ndidn't know the underlying hardware.\n\n415\n00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.660\nThey just saw the virtual hardware.\n\n416\n00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:06.910\nAnd so they just added, added, added until\nit ran us out of resources underneath.\n\n417\n00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.180\nAnd so, what we had to do was put\nin a few different technologies.\n\n418\n00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.640\nOne technology is templating.\n\n419\n00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.710\nWhen you have an application environment\nlike that, you can create a template so\n\n420\n00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.440\nthat when you deploy, it's not just,\nhere's a Window server, have at it.\n\n421\n00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.220\nYou can say, this is exactly what you get.\n\n422\n00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.580\nThis server has four GB of RAM,\nit has these two network cards,\n\n423\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.950\nthey're attached to these two networks.\n\n424\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.850\nAnd you can't change that,\nit's provisioned this way.\n\n425\n00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.630\nThe System Center Virtual Machine Manager\nfrom Microsoft\n\n426\n00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.650\nhas a self-service\nportal that can do this.\n\n427\n00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:36.340\nVMWare vSphere has a self-service\nportal that can do this.\n\n428\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:41.310\nAll the big Internet cloud providers,\nMicrosoft Azure, Amazon Web Services,\n\n429\n00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.700\nGoogle Compute, they've all got services\nlike this where you create templates,\n\n430\n00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.680\nand they can be deployed.\n\n431\n00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.750\nAnd you can give people permission\nas to whether they're allowed to\n\n432\n00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.130\nchange those templates or\nnot, and you probably don't.\n\n433\n00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:56.060\nBut the really cool part is where\nyou can set thresholds for them.\n\n434\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:01.000\nYou can set reserve resources like\na reservation, or you can set limits,\n\n435\n00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.980\nquotas.\n\n436\n00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:05.240\nAnd this is what we did,\nin the true story I was telling earlier.\n\n437\n00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.030\nWe used the System Center Virtual\nMachine Manager from Microsoft.\n\n438\n00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.030\nAnd we created a quota and basically\nwhat we did was we told the developers,\n\n439\n00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:14.140\nright you all get four credits, and\n\n440\n00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.530\nwhen you deploy a sandbox\nthe sandbox costs you four credits.\n\n441\n00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.020\nSo they would deploy a sandbox,\nand there went their credits.\n\n442\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.420\nAnd then if they tried to deploy another\none they were out of credits, and\n\n443\n00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.340\nthey couldn't do it.\n\n444\n00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.890\nThey had to delete their previous one\nbefore they could create a new one.\n\n445\n00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.210\nAnd by having that credit system in place,\n\n446\n00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.330\nthat stopped them from taking\nmore resources than they needed.\n\n447\n00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.320\nWe put in deployment templates that\nsaid when you deploy a sandbox,\n\n448\n00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.310\nhere's the resources it gets.\n\n449\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.680\nYou can't change that, right?\n\n450\n00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.120\nCuz they didn't need to change that.\n\n451\n00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.160\nIf their application's running\nslow they need to find out why and\n\n452\n00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.575\nnot just add more memory.\n\n453\n00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:46.205\nAnd then once they deployed it,\n\n454\n00:21:46.205 --> 00:21:49.025\nthe credits kept them in check as far\nas spinning up too many environments.\n\n455\n00:21:49.025 --> 00:21:52.525\nSo those two things,\ndeployment templates and credits,\n\n456\n00:21:52.525 --> 00:21:57.755\nthose created a great environment there,\nan enforceable quota that made those\n\n457\n00:21:57.755 --> 00:22:00.910\nusers operate within our specification,\nwith the resources that we had.\n\n458\n00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.190\nSystem center virtual machine\nmanager has all that built into it,\n\n459\n00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.160\nV sphere, V center has it all built into\nit also, you just have to set it up.\n\n460\n00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.040\nIt's not turned on by default, you've\ngot to get in there and configure that.\n\n461\n00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.700\nso if you want to learn more,\nthe SCVM website's kind of sparse but\n\n462\n00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.600\nif you search for the self service portal,\nthe SSP, the have a big write up on it.\n\n463\n00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.490\nIt's actually pretty slick, a webpage you\ngo to and you just point and click and\n\n464\n00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:23.970\nall of the sudden you've\ngot an environment.\n\n465\n00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.620\nIt's neat stuff.\n\n466\n00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.980\nYou'll see things like that all the time.\n\n467\n00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.300\nFor example, let me bring up Azure.\n\n468\n00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.260\nIn Microsoft Azure, I signed up for\na demo account in here.\n\n469\n00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.560\nNow, I'm just a demo user, so\n\n470\n00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.740\nI'm mostly getting free service\non a demo account right?\n\n471\n00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.960\nIf you go and sign up for\na demo account with Azure,\n\n472\n00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.890\nyou get 30 days of free service.\n\n473\n00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:48.310\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nspin up 100 instances with as much CPU\n\n474\n00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.890\npower as possible and\nstart bit coin mining for 30 days.\n\n475\n00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.140\nHow many bit coins could\nI generate in 30 days?\n\n476\n00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:53.680\nProbably one.\n\n477\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.530\nBut still I could do it and I would be\nconsuming a lot of Microsoft resources for\n\n478\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.030\na month and\nthey wouldn't be making any money right?\n\n479\n00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:00.820\nSo what do they do?\n\n480\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.180\nThey put limits on the account.\n\n481\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.880\nI've got quotas.\nThis is a self service portal.\n\n482\n00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.470\nI can come in here and\ndeploy as many VM's as I want.\n\n483\n00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:09.770\nAnd I don't have to open up support\ntickets with Microsoft to do it.\n\n484\n00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.280\nI can just come in here and do it.\n\n485\n00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.480\nBut they put a limit.\n\n486\n00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.650\nThey put a limit that says I\ncan't spin out more than 20 VMs.\n\n487\n00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.550\nAll right, so I've got that limit.\n\n488\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.500\nIf I want to do more than 20,\nI've got to contact tech support and\n\n489\n00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.760\nget them to lift that quota, right.\n\n490\n00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.660\nSo they've got that quota in place.\n\n491\n00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.250\nBut I've also have what's\ncalled an entitlement.\n\n492\n00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.930\nAll right, now what's an entitlement?\n\n493\n00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.130\nIf I go to my subscription here and\nhere's my subscription,\n\n494\n00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.360\nyou could see ITProTV Demo,\nright I've got a demo subscription and\n\n495\n00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.630\nwhen I go into that, right over here\nI could start to see my entitlement.\n\n496\n00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:42.230\nI'm entitled to certain resources and\nmy entitlement works out to,\n\n497\n00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:47.790\nI think it's a $150 a month, let's see\nif I can find that real quick, it is.\n\n498\n00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.760\nSo I can see my entitlement right here.\n\n499\n00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.521\nI have a starting credit of\n$150 US dollars per month.\n\n500\n00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:56.701\nSo if I start spinning up resources,\nI can do that.\n\n501\n00:23:56.701 --> 00:24:00.114\nI can spin up 20 VMs with\nas much CPU as I want.\n\n502\n00:24:00.114 --> 00:24:03.224\nBut I'll burn up that\n$150 credit pretty fast.\n\n503\n00:24:03.224 --> 00:24:06.340\nAnd once that happens,\nI've gotta start paying.\n\n504\n00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.870\nIf I have a credit card on file,\nit'll bill to the credit card.\n\n505\n00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.240\nIf I don't have a credit card on file\nit won't let me spin up the resources.\n\n506\n00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.839\nYou can see right here,\nI've got $125 left on my credit.\n\n507\n00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:22.510\nI've burned $24, and you know,\nwhatever, 16 cents, right?\n\n508\n00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:23.990\nSo, that's what I've\nburned up on my account so\n\n509\n00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.410\nfar and this is keeping me in check.\n\n510\n00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.970\nThis is called an entitlement or\nMicrosoft calls it a subscription, but\n\n511\n00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.380\nit's really an entitlement.\n\n512\n00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.250\nSo this is very similar to quota,\n\n513\n00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.890\nthey don't actually care how much\nmemory I have or how many CPUs I have.\n\n514\n00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:38.330\nThey don't care if I have ten servers or\none server, they don't care about that.\n\n515\n00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.330\nThey just care about how much\nmoney I'm consuming, right?\n\n516\n00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.520\nBecause I might only be doing databases.\n\n517\n00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.480\nI might not be doing virtual\nservers at all, right?\n\n518\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.770\nI might just be doing active directory\nservices and rights management,\n\n519\n00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:50.610\nand I burned up that $150.\n\n520\n00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.240\nI never spun up a single VM.\n\n521\n00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.100\nSo this gives us a lot more freedom.\n\n522\n00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.930\nEntitlements to subscriptions\nare all about freedom,\n\n523\n00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:59.480\nyou just have this kind of\nmain quota you draw from.\n\n524\n00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.540\nVersus deployment templates and credits.\n\n525\n00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.250\nThat's where we're dealing with\nvery structured deployment.\n\n526\n00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:07.200\nThis is exactly what you're going to get.\n\n527\n00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.080\nTwo different ways to\nachieve the same goal.\n\n528\n00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.040\n>> Now, with quotas, Don, I believe they\ndo come in a couple different flavors,\n\n529\n00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:13.780\nright.\n\n530\n00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.350\nWhen we say quotas that's not\nthe end of the story right?\n\n531\n00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.020\n>> Yeah, so you've got hard quotas and\nsoft quotas, right.\n\n532\n00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.490\nIf I have a credit card on\nfile this is a soft quota.\n\n533\n00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.490\nWhen I hit a $150 they\njust start billing me.\n\n534\n00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.690\nI never actually stop getting the service.\n\n535\n00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.790\nYou'll see this with like email accounts\nwhere you have too much in your\n\n536\n00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:31.570\nemail account, and\n\n537\n00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.940\nthey don't actually stop you from using\nit they just start giving you warnings.\n\n538\n00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.630\nThat's like a soft quota.\n\n539\n00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.880\nBut a hard quota is where I say,\n\n540\n00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.690\nyou hit $150 you're cut off you\ncan't spit up anything more.\n\n541\n00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.120\nIf you've got VM's running right now\nwe're going to shut them all down.\n\n542\n00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.780\nIf you got storage that's being used,\nwe're gonna delete it all.\n\n543\n00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:46.570\nThat's a hard quota.\n\n544\n00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:47.400\nThat's where it's enforced.\n\n545\n00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.020\nYou cannot cross that line.\n\n546\n00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:50.550\nThere's your limit.\n\n547\n00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.410\nSo when we configure these,\nif you're setting it up for\n\n548\n00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:57.390\nyour own private cloud,\nyou need to choose how you wanna do that.\n\n549\n00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.200\nAnd oftentimes you'll find that\ncompanies don't like hard quotas.\n\n550\n00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.590\nThat if it's your own infrastructure and\n\n551\n00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.810\nyour own employees that are going over\nthose limits, you wanna do a soft quota.\n\n552\n00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.490\nYou wanna be aware,\nyou wanna notify them but\n\n553\n00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.980\nyou don't want to stop them from\nbeing able to do their work.\n\n554\n00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.630\nSo you gotta find that balance\nbetween a hard quota and\n\n555\n00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.270\na soft quota in your environment.\n\n556\n00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:17.480\nIt's definitely one of those\nmore bureaucracy type things.\n\n557\n00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.570\nYou know you gotta get management\ninvolved to figure out what\n\n558\n00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.130\nyou want those limits to be.\n\n559\n00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:23.570\nSo just a couple of neat\nlittle concepts there.\n\n560\n00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:29.420\nThe other thing is to remember that\nwhen we set this stuff up that\n\n561\n00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.920\nthere's a lot of resources\nwe don't think about.\n\n562\n00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.050\nWe think about CPU, memory,\nnetwork, disk, right?\n\n563\n00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:36.460\nWe think about that stuff.\n\n564\n00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.510\nBut we don't think about things\nlike money sometimes, right?\n\n565\n00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.330\nJust our raw dollar sign value,\nlike those entitlements allow us to set.\n\n566\n00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.870\nSo we need to make sure that we get\nthat defined, we get that figured out.\n\n567\n00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.840\nThat is a resource, although it's not\nnecessarily a technology resource.\n\n568\n00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.030\nIt's a financial resource.\n\n569\n00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.750\nIt's still equally important.\n\n570\n00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:56.170\nThe other thing that can run\nthese costs up are licenses.\n\n571\n00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.870\nAnd I know I mentioned licenses in the\nlast episode when I was talking about our\n\n572\n00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:03.540\nhosts, that if you have VMware ESX,\nevery physical host costs you money.\n\n573\n00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.910\nIf you have hyper-V,\nyou're deploying Windows, and\n\n574\n00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.440\nso every physical host costs you money.\n\n575\n00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.560\nIf you're deploying CentOS it's free.\n\n576\n00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.590\nYour hosts don't cost\nyou money at that point.\n\n577\n00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:18.120\nRight, so it's easy to look at those and\nsay, I want to go CentOS,\n\n578\n00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.350\nbecause that's going to be free,\nwhy not do that one?\n\n579\n00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.190\nI can do KVM on CentOS,\nget a great solution.\n\n580\n00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.560\nVersus KVM on Red Hat,\nwhere I've got to pay per server.\n\n581\n00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.710\nRemember that it's not just\nabout the host licensing.\n\n582\n00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:33.480\nYou also have the guest\nlicensing involved.\n\n583\n00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.650\nThose guest operating systems cost money.\n\n584\n00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:41.860\nWhen you have a Windows VM or a Red Hat\nVM, somebody's gotta pay for that, right?\n\n585\n00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.040\nIt's a virtual machine, sure,\nbut somebody's gotta pay.\n\n586\n00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:49.650\nAnd so you might find that you choose to\ngo CentOS as your base operating system,\n\n587\n00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:54.170\nyour host OS, and put KVM on it, and\nthen you spin up ten Windows VMs.\n\n588\n00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.110\nEach of those Windows VMs costs money.\n\n589\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.870\nNow, if you do CentOS VMs on top\nof CentOS, it's completely free.\n\n590\n00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.600\nBut those Windows VMs cost money.\n\n591\n00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.020\nWe've gotta remember that each guest\nwe spin up, even if it's in a test or\n\n592\n00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.850\na lab,\nyou've got a license you've gotta pay for.\n\n593\n00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.760\nAnd there's exceptions to that.\n\n594\n00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.200\nIf you get Windows Server 2012\nR2 Datacenter Edition, god,\n\n595\n00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.600\nthat is a long name.\n\n596\n00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.690\nBut if you get the Datacenter Edition,\nit actually comes with licenses,\n\n597\n00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.520\nyou can setup as many VMs as you want,\nyou don't have to pay for the VMs.\n\n598\n00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.870\nNow the Datacenter Edition\ncosts a lot more money, right,\n\n599\n00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:29.540\nI think it's like ten grand for\nlike two cores or something.\n\n600\n00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.480\nSo it's a lot of money,\nbut your VM's are free.\n\n601\n00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.960\nVersus if I had done\nZen server underneath.\n\n602\n00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.990\nZen server might only cost $1,000, but\nthen I got to pay for each guest VM.\n\n603\n00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:43.830\nSo your money doesn't necessarily add\nup to what you think it might be.\n\n604\n00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.470\nSometimes running a free OS\ncan be kind of expensive.\n\n605\n00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:48.830\nAnd sometimes running a licensed\nOS isn't any better, so\n\n606\n00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.770\nyou've gotta take that into account, and\nnowhere is that more visible than AWS.\n\n607\n00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.150\nHere, let me show you guys, in AWS.\n\n608\n00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.810\nIf I jump into EC2, and\nI go to spin up an instance, right?\n\n609\n00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:00.110\nActually, I don't even need\nto spin the instance up.\n\n610\n00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.910\nLet me just bring up the EC2 pricing.\n\n611\n00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:06.700\nSo, if I take a look at\nEC2's pricing schedule.\n\n612\n00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.380\nAnd look at at what things cost.\n\n613\n00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.390\nAmazon is really transparent about\ntheir pricing on this stuff.\n\n614\n00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:14.420\nWhen I go through and\nlook at the instance pricing.\n\n615\n00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.110\nAnd I jump in.\n\n616\n00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.490\nAnd here,\nI'll just do an on demand instance price.\n\n617\n00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:18.520\nSo if I'm going to spin up a server.\n\n618\n00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:20.670\nWhen you look at it,\n\n619\n00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:24.260\nnotice how I have different tabs\nbased on whether I want Linux.\n\n620\n00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.650\nOr Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\nwhich is Linux but\n\n621\n00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:28.680\nit's a commercial version of Linux.\n\n622\n00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:34.160\nOr SuSE Linux SLES, that's another\ncommercial entity, Windows and so on.\n\n623\n00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.660\nIf I just do Linux,\n\n624\n00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.490\nthat's the Amazon Linux AMI that\nis based on CentOS and it's free.\n\n625\n00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:43.167\nAnd so\nif I look at a let's take a m4.large.\n\n626\n00:29:43.167 --> 00:29:47.872\nSo an m4.large with\nAmazon's Linux Is $0.12 per hour,\n\n627\n00:29:47.872 --> 00:29:51.740\nokay, $0.12 per hour for\njust regular old Linux.\n\n628\n00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:57.000\nIf I go Red Hat, that m4.large becomes\n$0.18 an hour, right, $0.06 an hour more.\n\n629\n00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.260\nAnd it's cuz it's gotta cover\nthe operating system license,\n\n630\n00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.570\nit's gotta pay for\nthat license that you're using.\n\n631\n00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:05.350\nYou're renting a license during that time.\n\n632\n00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.082\nAnd if we go Windows,\nlet's jump up to Windows,\n\n633\n00:30:08.082 --> 00:30:11.030\nthat m4.large becomes $0.246 per minute.\n\n634\n00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:16.630\nSo we were at $0.12 for regular Linux,\n\n635\n00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:22.110\nwe're at $0.18 for Red Hat Linux and\nnow were at almost $0.25 for Windows.\n\n636\n00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.180\nIt's that license.\n\n637\n00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.890\nThe license of the operating\nsystem factors in,\n\n638\n00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:29.250\nso don't just think about your\nhardware when you think about costs.\n\n639\n00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.050\nRemember your software licensing.\n\n640\n00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.430\nThe more these VMs I spin up\nthe more I'm gonna have to pay,\n\n641\n00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:37.190\nand this is where that scale up\nversus scale out decision comes in.\n\n642\n00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:41.710\nCuz if I have one VM with eight\nGB of RAM that's one VM license.\n\n643\n00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:46.160\nBut if I have two VMs with 4 GB of RAM, I\nmight get better performance if I pay for\n\n644\n00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.110\ntwo host licenses.\n\n645\n00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:50.200\nSo always remember your licensing\nas part of metering this out.\n\n646\n00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.790\nAnd if you've only bought 20 licenses,\nyou can't spin up more than 20 VMs,\n\n647\n00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.070\nyou've got that limit.\n\n648\n00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:59.960\nAnd that's another resource we've\ngot to monitor, meter, and allocate.\n\n649\n00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.850\nAll right so\nwe've talked about a lot of stuff.\n\n650\n00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.370\nThe only other thing I have on my notes\nto cover here is resource pooling.\n\n651\n00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:12.150\nAnd I covered resource pooling in another\nepisode when we were talking about\n\n652\n00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.220\nhow we can share resources\nbetween systems.\n\n653\n00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:17.180\nAnd I specifically did it in\nstorage talking about IOPs.\n\n654\n00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.430\nWhen you have resources\nthat are available,\n\n655\n00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:23.550\nsometimes you can pool them together to\nget the most effective use out of it.\n\n656\n00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:29.180\nAnd that's called the resource pool, and\nit maybe shared storage, it maybe disk IO,\n\n657\n00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.220\nit might be CPU cycles where you share\nthem amongst the pool of machines.\n\n658\n00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.100\nIt's really just dynamic allocation,\nright?\n\n659\n00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.210\nIt's like what we talked\nabout with dynamic CPU's and\n\n660\n00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:39.820\nthin provisioning of storage and so on.\n\n661\n00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.990\nIt's the same concept.\n\n662\n00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.490\nSo resource pooling is just one big name\n\n663\n00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:47.130\nthat encompasses all those smaller\nelements that we talked about earlier.\n\n664\n00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.830\nSo just be aware that you might\nsee that term on the exam.\n\n665\n00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.580\nIf you're not familiar with it, check out\nour storage episode cuz I show a great\n\n666\n00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:58.600\nexample of setting up an IOPs pool inside\nof Microsoft Azure for some SQL servers.\n\n667\n00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.950\nAnd it's just pretty easy to do and\nit creates that shared resource.\n\n668\n00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:05.610\nBut as with any dynamic technology,\nyou've gotta monitor it.\n\n669\n00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:07.980\nYou've gotta keep track of it\nto know if you're going over,\n\n670\n00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.640\nto know if you're getting contention.\n\n671\n00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.180\nBecause then you need to either\nincrease the size of your pool or\n\n672\n00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.440\nstart adding some dedicated resources.\n\n673\n00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.940\n>> In this episode, we have looked at,\nwell, networking right, and\n\n674\n00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:22.040\nwhat we do and the best practices for\nallocating network resources.\n\n675\n00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.700\nWe've also looked at some\nof the best practices for\n\n676\n00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.640\nallocating storage resources and\nthen finished it up with quotas.\n\n677\n00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.860\nNow, in the first part of the episode,\ngo back and watch that.\n\n678\n00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:33.750\nRemember we looked at CPU and\nwe looked at some other concepts as well,\n\n679\n00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.560\nif we're catching you off guard.\n\n680\n00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.910\nBut looks like we've come to\nthe end of another episode.\n\n681\n00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.950\nDon do you have anything else for\nus on this one?\n\n682\n00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.380\n>> I think I've rambled on long enough.\n\n683\n00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.500\nI do have a little more I wanna\ntalk about with some other topics,\n\n684\n00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.000\nwhich we'll get into in other episodes.\n\n685\n00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.360\nBut as far as resource allocation,\nwe've covered a lot of things.\n\n686\n00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.810\nThat's a pretty good point for\nus to stop right there.\n\n687\n00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.360\n>> A lot of good information on this one,\nDon.\n\n688\n00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.350\nThank you for that.\n\n689\n00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:54.780\nGot anything else for us in this episode?\n\n690\n00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.070\n>> I think that's probably about it.\n\n691\n00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:57.950\nI've rambled on enough, so\nwe'll go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n692\n00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:58.500\nStay tuned,\n\n693\n00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.370\nwe've got a lot more Cloud+ coverage\nthat's gonna be coming down the pipe.\n\n694\n00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:02.770\n>> All right,\nI look forward to seeing that, and\n\n695\n00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:04.390\nwe look forward to seeing you guys there,\nbut\n\n696\n00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.230\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n697\n00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:11.990\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n698\n00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.990\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n699\n00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.232\n>> And we'll see you

00:00:16.664\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:19.820\nin today's episode we're going to be\nmoving along in our Cloud+ training.\n\n5\n00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.250\nAnd today we're gonna be looking at\nmore specifically, remote access, and\n\n6\n00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.130\nhow do we gain access to the cloud-based\nservices when we need to.\n\n7\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.794\nAnd we got Don Pezet here to help us out.\n\n8\n00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:29.800\nDon, how you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.949\nAnd welcome back.\n\n10\n00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.380\n>> [LAUGH] Well thanks for\nhaving me back on the show, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.250\nIt's kinda a neat topic to jump into,\nthe remote access side of things.\n\n12\n00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.310\nCuz we spend a lot of time talking\nabout creating the virtual machines,\n\n13\n00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.350\nand creating this, creating that,\nputting it in place.\n\n14\n00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.725\nAnd we don't really see getting in and\nusing the resources that we make, and so\n\n15\n00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:47.810\nthat's what we're gonna look at here.\n\n16\n00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.067\nI wanna talk about remote access\nto connect to the hosts, right,\n\n17\n00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:52.728\nthe virtualization platforms,\n\n18\n00:00:52.728 --> 00:00:55.944\nas well as remote access to connect\nto the guests that we create.\n\n19\n00:00:55.944 --> 00:00:59.228\nAnd it's actually very similar between the\ntwo, the different ways that we use it,\n\n20\n00:00:59.228 --> 00:01:01.414\nbut we're just gonna kind of\nrun through some of those.\n\n21\n00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:03.991\nWe won't spend a ton of time on it,\nbecause for most platforms,\n\n22\n00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:06.838\nwhen you deploy it, you can kinda\nrely on your vendor documentation.\n\n23\n00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:10.430\nBut I wanna show you the most common\nones and just give you a few scenarios.\n\n24\n00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.650\nAll right, so let's kick it off, and\n\n25\n00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.230\nI wanna start by talking\nabout the platform, right.\n\n26\n00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.850\nWhen you deploy a cloud, if it's a public\ncloud, it might be Amazon Web Services or\n\n27\n00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.348\nMicrosoft Azure, for those guys,\nthey've got a nice web UI.\n\n28\n00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.368\nYou just go to the webpage, you log in and\n\n29\n00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:26.514\nyou can spin up all\nthe instances you want.\n\n30\n00:01:26.514 --> 00:01:30.712\nI know I've brought it up in a few of our\nshows, so we've kinda seen it before,\n\n31\n00:01:30.712 --> 00:01:33.595\nbut that web interface is\nhow we manage the platform.\n\n32\n00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:36.821\nAnd a lot of them have APIs for\ncommand line type access also,\n\n33\n00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:40.270\nMicrosoft lets you send with\nthe Azure PowerShell commandlet.\n\n34\n00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.420\nSo you can send PowerShell commands up\nto create virtual machines and stuff.\n\n35\n00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.430\nWith Amazon, they have their own API,\nyou can do the same thing and\n\n36\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.730\nthe AWS CLI, so those are different\nways we can access those public clouds.\n\n37\n00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.840\nBut for a private cloud, when you\ndeploy it, when you create the whole\n\n38\n00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.220\ninfrastructure yourself, you are the one\nwho has to create that environment, right?\n\n39\n00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.380\nAnd how do you manage that system?\n\n40\n00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.235\nWell, it's somewhat up to you, right?\n\n41\n00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:05.771\nLet's start with the one that\nyou're always gonna have, and\n\n42\n00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:07.380\nthat's console access.\n\n43\n00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.120\nWhen you bring up a hypervisor, at a\nminimum, you can hook a keyboard, a mouse,\n\n44\n00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.920\nand a monitor up to that physical\nserver and you will see something.\n\n45\n00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.620\nIt might not be the most useful thing on\nthe planet, but you will see something.\n\n46\n00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.650\nLet me just show you some examples here.\n\n47\n00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.640\nSo, if I had installed ESX on\na physical box, and I hook a monitor,\n\n48\n00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.980\nand a keyboard, and a mouse,\nI'm gonna see this screen right here.\n\n49\n00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.990\nAnd this is actually its little sleep\nmode, so it's kind of dimmed out a little\n\n50\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.410\nbit, but if I hit a button,\nthere we go, it wakes up.\n\n51\n00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.290\nAnd, all we're seeing is a really simple\nsplash page which, at first glance,\n\n52\n00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.120\nlooks like we can't do anything, right?\n\n53\n00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.470\nIf you kind of look at some of\nthe stuff that it's giving me,\n\n54\n00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.540\nit tells me information about my system.\n\n55\n00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.188\nSo this one's running ESXi version 6.0,\nI've got two processors, or two cores.\n\n56\n00:02:54.188 --> 00:02:56.710\nI've got four gigs of memory\nattached to this system,\n\n57\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.260\nwhich is not a whole heck of a lot.\n\n58\n00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.465\nAnd then right down here it says,\ndownload tools to manage this host from,\n\n59\n00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:07.800\n10.1.230.20, that's the IP address that\nwas assigned to this host when it came up.\n\n60\n00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.580\nAnd what they're basically trying to tell\nme here is hey, buddy you're in the wrong\n\n61\n00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.790\nplace, you don't manage the server from\nhere, you need to go and use our software\n\n62\n00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.720\nand connect up, use this IP, get connected\nand you can manage the system, right.\n\n63\n00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.610\nBut I can see this, and there is actually\na little bit that I can do from here.\n\n64\n00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.760\nWhat you'll see is way down\nat the bottom of the screen,\n\n65\n00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.980\nand let me see if I can zoom in on that,\nthere we go,\n\n66\n00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.300\nwe've got this press F12 to Shut Down or\nRestart, right?\n\n67\n00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.558\nWell, that's not very exciting [LAUGH]\nI can shut it down and restart it.\n\n68\n00:03:39.558 --> 00:03:42.969\nSo we do have that, and\nthen on the other side,\n\n69\n00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.000\nI've got press F2 to Customize System and\nView Logs.\n\n70\n00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.450\nNow that's a little more exciting for\nme right there, right?\n\n71\n00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.630\nIf I want to start to actually work\nwith this system, I could press F2,\n\n72\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.360\nand it's gonna make me log\nin with whatever password\n\n73\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.490\nwe assigned when we created the system.\n\n74\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.070\nBut then it's gonna give me\na limited management interface to\n\n75\n00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.970\nbegin working with this system.\n\n76\n00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.925\nAnd so\nhere I am in that limited interface.\n\n77\n00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:08.020\nAnd you'll see the choices it gives me.\n\n78\n00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.983\nI can configure my password, I can\nconfigure lockdown mode, that only works\n\n79\n00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:13.825\nwhen you're connected to vCenter so\nthat's why it's grayed out for me.\n\n80\n00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:16.020\nI can configure the management network.\n\n81\n00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.150\nIf you ever screw up and lock yourself\nout of the management network interface,\n\n82\n00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.860\nI can recover that right here.\n\n83\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.710\nI can do a network restore and\n\n84\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.180\nput my entire network\nconfiguration back in place.\n\n85\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.690\nI can configure my keyboard,\nI can view the system logs, and\n\n86\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.730\nI can reset the configuration.\n\n87\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.820\nCan I create virtual machines?\n\n88\n00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.600\nNo.\n\n89\n00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.870\nCan I start and stop virtual machines?\n\n90\n00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:36.650\nNo.\n\n91\n00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.030\nCan I create virtual networks?\n\n92\n00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.870\nNo.\n\n93\n00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.210\nIt's a very, very limited interface.\n\n94\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.330\nThe console is really\njust an emergency level,\n\n95\n00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.102\nlike you've gotten yourself locked out,\nhere's how we get back in, right?\n\n96\n00:04:49.102 --> 00:04:52.730\nReally base-level stuff, not intended\nto be used for any regular management.\n\n97\n00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.050\nSo most people just pretend this\nconsole doesn't even exist.\n\n98\n00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.950\nNow that's VMware,\nnot everybody's like that.\n\n99\n00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.130\nCitrix XenServer, for example, I've got\none of those in the background here.\n\n100\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.800\nWhen you plug a monitor, a keyboard, or\na mouse into a Citrix XenServer you'll see\n\n101\n00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.000\na screen like this, which is black,\nright, it's just gone to sleep, right?\n\n102\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.890\nAnd if we wake that up,\n\n103\n00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.830\nyou actually see a screen that's a bit\nmore useful than what we saw with VMware.\n\n104\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.500\nWhat they give us is the ability\nto do all sorts of things.\n\n105\n00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.240\nWe've got the network and management\ninterface like we saw with VMware.\n\n106\n00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.940\nBut we can actually view\nthe virtual machines we have.\n\n107\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.585\nAnd you can't create virtual machines,\nbut you can start and stop them.\n\n108\n00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:32.990\nAnd you can even migrate them from one\nhost to another if we're in a cluster.\n\n109\n00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.360\nWe can see our disk and\nstorage repositories, and\n\n110\n00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.580\nactually do some basic\nconfiguration there.\n\n111\n00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.600\nSo with XenServer,\n\n112\n00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.250\nwe can actually do a little bit from\nthe console, not a ton, but a little bit.\n\n113\n00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.520\nAnd what it really wants us to do,\nis not to work from here, but\n\n114\n00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.430\njust like with ESX, to install a software\nto remotely manage the system.\n\n115\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.930\nAnd in fact, if I were to get out of this,\n\n116\n00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.760\nwhich, let's see if I can\nremember how to even do that.\n\n117\n00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.880\nBut anyway, after a while,\nthe machine will time out, and\n\n118\n00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.980\nit'll display a little pop up saying\nbrowse to this page to manage the server,\n\n119\n00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.440\nand it'll give the IP just like\nwe saw with the VMWare box.\n\n120\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.227\nThe only real exception to this is\nMicrosoft's Hyper-V because on Hyper-V\n\n121\n00:06:14.227 --> 00:06:15.480\nwhen you log in to it,\n\n122\n00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.750\nit's a full Windows desktop, right,\nunless you do a core services install.\n\n123\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.350\nOn a regular install you have\na graphical user interface.\n\n124\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.880\nAnd you can launch your Hyper-V\nmanager and you can work with it and\n\n125\n00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.320\nyou can do everything\nright from the console.\n\n126\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.420\nBut the trade off there is, that means\nwe need a lot more resources tied to\n\n127\n00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.340\nour host machine to keep it running than\nVMWare and Citrix do, cuz on those guys,\n\n128\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.240\nyou just need a small amount of memory and\nCPU available to power that host.\n\n129\n00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.580\n>> You know, Don, those first two screens,\n\n130\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.362\nthey bear a striking resemblance to\nthe basic screens we see in BIOS.\n\n131\n00:06:47.362 --> 00:06:51.315\nAnd I wanna be careful with that, because\nwe did see in XenCenter there that, or\n\n132\n00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:54.690\nthe XenServer, that you do have\na location that says view the BIOS.\n\n133\n00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.710\nSo it's not BIOS, but boy,\nit really looks like BIOS.\n\n134\n00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.440\n>> Yeah, it's supposed to be super\nsimple and it's supposed to work on\n\n135\n00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.050\nevery monitor, that's why it's\nlike super low resolution and all,\n\n136\n00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.110\nit's just not designed to be fancy and\nflashy.\n\n137\n00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.120\nInstead, what they're expecting you to do\nis to run full-blown management clients.\n\n138\n00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.680\nSo Hyper-V here that I'm showing you\nguys is a full-blown management client.\n\n139\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.080\nAnd if I have more than one Hyper-V\nhost I can just come up here and\n\n140\n00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.230\nadd them to my Hyper-V manager by\nchoosing this Connect to Server.\n\n141\n00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.890\nAnd I can connect to as many other servers\nas I've got, so I might have other ones,\n\n142\n00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.980\nI can punch in their data here and\nget connected.\n\n143\n00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.550\nAnd then I can start to manage\nthem from this panel, and\n\n144\n00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.640\nI can create VMs,\nturn them on, turn them off.\n\n145\n00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.810\nDo all that other great stuff.\n\n146\n00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:41.120\nWell, for Citrix and for VMWare,\nwe have those clients too, right?\n\n147\n00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.500\nIt's just,\nthey don't make an operating system for\n\n148\n00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.490\nyou to run on your desktop\nlike Microsoft does.\n\n149\n00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.130\nSo Microsoft gives it to us right\nhere as part of the operating system.\n\n150\n00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.556\nBut with Xen and\nwith ESX we've gotta install it ourselves.\n\n151\n00:07:51.556 --> 00:07:54.431\nAnd the way you normally do that\nis by firing up a web browser and\n\n152\n00:07:54.431 --> 00:07:56.712\njust pointing it to the IP\naddress of the server.\n\n153\n00:07:56.712 --> 00:08:01.356\nSo, for example, if I browse to\nthe IP address of my ESX server,\n\n154\n00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:06.946\nI get this web page right here, and\nit's telling me I'm on a VMware ESXi box,\n\n155\n00:08:06.946 --> 00:08:10.930\nand I can download the vSphere client for\nWindows.\n\n156\n00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.400\nThat's the management client for\nmanaging ESX, right?\n\n157\n00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.460\nvSphere client,\nwe use to manage individual ESX boxes, and\n\n158\n00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.580\nthen there's vCenter,\nwhich is a full blown server install that\n\n159\n00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.670\nwe can use to manage\ntons of VMware systems.\n\n160\n00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.680\nAnd so it even gives me links\nto VMware vCenter right here.\n\n161\n00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.820\nIf I just want to manage this one I can\nget the vSphere client for windows and\n\n162\n00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.080\nknock it out.\n\n163\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.520\nI get the same thing if I browse to my Zen\nserver tech tree, even more stripped down.\n\n164\n00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.580\nIf I browse to my Zen server\nI get this amazing webpage.\n\n165\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.570\nTons of theming and\ncolors implemented here.\n\n166\n00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.710\nRight?\nIt's just two links.\n\n167\n00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.660\nI can get the XenCenter CD image as\nan ISO or the XenCenter installer.\n\n168\n00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.250\nI can install XenCenter.\n\n169\n00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.590\nThe management software for\nCitrix Xen right here on the system.\n\n170\n00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.120\nJust by clicking that link and\ninstalling it.\n\n171\n00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.950\nAll right.\n\n172\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.500\nOnce I have that software,\nthat's my real work can get done.\n\n173\n00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.020\nRight?\n\n174\n00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.320\nSo for example,\nthis is the VMware Vsphere client and\n\n175\n00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.040\nI've pointed it as my vSpear server,\nmy ESX server, and\n\n176\n00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.340\nif I had more than one ESX server I\ncould just add them all in here and\n\n177\n00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.360\nstart to manage them and\nlooking in the center box,\n\n178\n00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.730\nhere's where I can get the summary for\nthe system, and I can see my CPU usage,\n\n179\n00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:27.850\nmy memory usage, my storage, my network\nI can get into my Virtual Machines, and\n\n180\n00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.690\nI can start creating VMs, starting,\nstopping, all that functionality.\n\n181\n00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.230\nI can jump into my Configuration,\nand I can go into Networking.\n\n182\n00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.480\nAnd here's where I can\nfigure my network adaptors,\n\n183\n00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.450\nmy virtual switches and all of that.\n\n184\n00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:44.510\nI now have full configuration capabilities\nrunning from this client instead\n\n185\n00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.279\nof trying to make use of that console\nthat's right there directly on the system.\n\n186\n00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.360\nZen Center, same way.\n\n187\n00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.220\nSo this is Zen Center, what we use for\nmanaging those Citrix Zen boxes, and\n\n188\n00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.230\nagain, I just add in the servers\nthat I wanna manage, and\n\n189\n00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.930\nonce I'm connected to them,\nI can see all their properties and\n\n190\n00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.200\ndetails, I can look at the memory\nallocation and how that's running, I can\n\n191\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.310\nconfigure my storage and what's available\nfor VMs, I can configure my networking.\n\n192\n00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.020\nRight?\nWhich virtual networks I have as well as\n\n193\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.530\nwhich physical adapters I have and\nhow they're configured.\n\n194\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.150\nYou can go through and\n\n195\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.730\nconfigure all of these settings in a fully\nfunctional graphical user interface.\n\n196\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:19.800\nThese are very powerful.\n\n197\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.023\nThey work really well.\n\n198\n00:10:21.023 --> 00:10:25.930\nWe just have to know that they exist and\ninstall them and make use of them.\n\n199\n00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:30.580\nNow, one thing to be aware of, where you\nrun this software makes a difference.\n\n200\n00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.760\nIf you're on the same\nnetwork as that host,\n\n201\n00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.860\nyou may be able to launch this software\nand connect right up to, it's no big deal.\n\n202\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.110\nBut if I'm on one network, and\nthe host is on a different network,\n\n203\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.770\nI might have to pass through routers,\nfire walls, other things.\n\n204\n00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.610\nAnd that can cause this\nsoftware not to work.\n\n205\n00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.560\nSo look up the documentation\nfrom your vender and\n\n206\n00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.530\nsee what fire wall reports,\nwhat needs to bee open and\n\n207\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.480\nallowed to get this software to be\nable to connect to the servers.\n\n208\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.150\nSo for example, Microsoft's Hyper-V\nManager uses TCP port 137 to connect.\n\n209\n00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.890\nAnd so if that's being blocked by\na firewall, you're not gonna get through.\n\n210\n00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.720\nVCenter and the vSphere client,\nthey use ports 902 and 903.\n\n211\n00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.030\nIf I remember right it's 902 for\nunsecured and 903 for secured,\n\n212\n00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.130\nI could be wrong on that.\n\n213\n00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.180\nBut you've gotta make sure\nyou open those ports up or\n\n214\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.570\nyou're not gonna be able to connect.\n\n215\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.290\nZen client, the Zen center.\n\n216\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.140\nI think it actually runs everything\nover 443 if I remember right.\n\n217\n00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.870\nSo they have different needs, different\nthings that you may have to open.\n\n218\n00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.410\nBut you just gotta research that and\nfind out and make sure that gets opened.\n\n219\n00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.350\nBut these client, they're where\nwe're gonna spend most of our time.\n\n220\n00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.080\nThis is how we're gonna manage this host.\n\n221\n00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.140\nWhen you go with AWS or Microsoft Azure,\n\n222\n00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.760\nthey hide the underlying infrastructure\nfrom you, so we don't need these clients.\n\n223\n00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.300\nWe don't need that management\ninterface because we can't see and\n\n224\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.850\nmanage those components anyway.\n\n225\n00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.260\nWe just work with VMs.\n\n226\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.530\nAnd that's why they give you that web\nbased user interface where you just see\n\n227\n00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.630\nthe VMs and you don't get\nthe underlying infrastructure.\n\n228\n00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.340\nSo like Don said pay attention\nto the vendor documentation\n\n229\n00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.820\nto ensure that you can connect\nto the VM host itself.\n\n230\n00:11:54.820 --> 00:12:00.010\nNow, that's the host we also have some\nVM's running inside of the host and\n\n231\n00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.480\noccasionally we need to\nconnect to them as well.\n\n232\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.720\nSo it's gonna be a little bit\ndifferent for those right Don?\n\n233\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.480\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n234\n00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.630\nSo once you start spinning\nup guests right the guest\n\n235\n00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.550\nVM's you're gonna want\nto connect to them too.\n\n236\n00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.920\nWell all three software packages I\njust showed you, the hyper-V manager,\n\n237\n00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:18.480\nthe Zen center, and\nthe vSphere client, all three\n\n238\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.360\nof those will let you connect to what's\ncalled the consul of the virtual machine.\n\n239\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.240\nIt's the equivalent of plugging a monitor,\nkeyboard, and\n\n240\n00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.420\nmouse into the virtual machine,\nseeing the local consul of that system.\n\n241\n00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:33.160\nSo if I've got these server management\nsoftware I can connect to the clients.\n\n242\n00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.700\nAnd let me just show you real quick.\n\n243\n00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.750\nSo here I am in the Hyper-V manager and\nI've got this domain controller that's\n\n244\n00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.650\nsitting here running, I can just right\nclick on that and choose connect.\n\n245\n00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:46.220\nAnd when I choose to connect, it's\ngonna pop out a window, any moment now.\n\n246\n00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.280\n[LAUGH] And it's gonna pop out a window,\nnot necessarily fast, but\n\n247\n00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.110\nit is gonna pop out a window and\nI will then see that desktop and\n\n248\n00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.060\nI'll be able to login as\nif I was plugged into it.\n\n249\n00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.270\n>> I'll take a guess that it's not\na pop-up, it's a pop-up under.\n\n250\n00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.200\n>> There we go.\nApparently I didn't click with enough\n\n251\n00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.260\nconviction.\n\n252\n00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.170\nSo there we go.\n\n253\n00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.140\nSo now I've clicked with force.\n\n254\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.500\nAnd so I'm seeing that desktop.\n\n255\n00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.230\nAnd if I full-screen it, now there it is,\n\n256\n00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.990\nI've got this Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete\nto login, which I can attempt to do.\n\n257\n00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.590\nPressing control alt delete to log in.\n\n258\n00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:17.700\nHow would we normally do that?\n\n259\n00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.310\nYou'd probably press control\nAlt delete to log in but\n\n260\n00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.210\nI'm now remoted into this system.\n\n261\n00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.020\nAnd so when I press control Alt delete,\n\n262\n00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.720\nthat signal may get\nintercepted by my host, right?\n\n263\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.310\nBy the host machine, and not the guest.\n\n264\n00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.190\nSo that's what's happening to me.\n\n265\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.950\nI'm pressing Control+Alt+Delete,\nand nothing is happening.\n\n266\n00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.200\nAnd I'm just kind of stuck, right?\n\n267\n00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.140\nSo if that happens to you, most of these\nsoftware programs will have a shortcut\n\n268\n00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:47.360\nkey or command or something to be able to\nsend that signal over to the other side.\n\n269\n00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.350\nAnd in this case, since I'm.\n\n270\n00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.410\nI dropped into a window,\nlet me put that back here.\n\n271\n00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.490\nIf I'm taken out of full screen\nmode I've got this nice little\n\n272\n00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.530\nbutton right here that says\nsend control alt delete.\n\n273\n00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.450\nSo I need to use that button because\nI'm not able to send control alt delete\n\n274\n00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.380\notherwise and\nthen I can go back to full screen mode and\n\n275\n00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.490\nI can function like I was\nassuming I know my password.\n\n276\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.690\nSo now I can get logged in and\nI'm logged into that guest.\n\n277\n00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.590\nSo the first way that we\ncan access our guests\n\n278\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.140\nis by using the management software.\n\n279\n00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.400\nSo vCenter, vSphere Client, ZenCenter, and\n\n280\n00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.550\nthe Hyper V Manager all provide ways\nto get connected up to those clients.\n\n281\n00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.540\nBut what if I want to give\nsomebody else access?\n\n282\n00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:38.280\nMaybe I run a private cloud and Wes comes\nto me and says Don I need a web server.\n\n283\n00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.010\nAnd I say okay,\nWes I'm gonna spin up a Linux box and\n\n284\n00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.960\nI'm gonna give you access to it.\n\n285\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.520\nI want Wes to have access to that guest, I\ndon't want him to have access to the host.\n\n286\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.720\nI don't want to have him install\nthe vSphere client and see all the VMs.\n\n287\n00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.240\nI just want him to have access\nto that one individual VM.\n\n288\n00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.640\nAnd so\nto provide access to the guest itself,\n\n289\n00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.950\nI can go this route where I give out the\nconsole, but if I don't wanna go that way,\n\n290\n00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:09.150\nI can rely on whatever remote connectivity\nis built into the guest operating systems.\n\n291\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.870\nAnd different guest operating\nsystems have different resources.\n\n292\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:16.240\nSo for example, Windows,\nright, so if we use Windows,\n\n293\n00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.690\nlet me get out of all this mess.\n\n294\n00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.530\nI'm getting several levels deep\nhere in my virtualization topology.\n\n295\n00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.970\nSo I'm gonna get out of this box here.\n\n296\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:28.230\nAnd let's say that I spin\nup a virtual machine.\n\n297\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.900\nFor example,\ndo I have one fired up right now?\n\n298\n00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.580\nOkay, see how much junk\nI've got running here.\n\n299\n00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.590\nLet me power up this sever.\n\n300\n00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.560\nSo I'm gonna power up a server,\nand this is a virtual system,\n\n301\n00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.770\nyou see it's booting in VMware,\nso I'm booting this up.\n\n302\n00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.623\nNow, I can access this through VMware,\nthat's how I'm doing it right now,\n\n303\n00:15:45.623 --> 00:15:49.477\nI'm doing it through the management\nconsole, but if I wanna give less access\n\n304\n00:15:49.477 --> 00:15:52.557\nto it, all I need to do is go into\nthe guest operating system and\n\n305\n00:15:52.557 --> 00:15:54.484\nconfigure remote access from there.\n\n306\n00:15:54.484 --> 00:16:00.057\nAnd so I can do that,\nagain assuming I can remember my password.\n\n307\n00:16:00.057 --> 00:16:01.914\nAnd that's gonna be my\nbig challenge of the day.\n\n308\n00:16:01.914 --> 00:16:05.379\nI can do that through whatever software\nit is that I have, in Windows,\n\n309\n00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:09.110\nyou have a product called Remote Desktop\nthat's built into it by default.\n\n310\n00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.960\nWe just need to flip a switch\nto turn it on, and so\n\n311\n00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.970\nwhen this system comes up I'm gonna get\nsome local data on my server right here.\n\n312\n00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.210\nAnd I can see what the remote\ndesktop is turned on or not.\n\n313\n00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:24.300\nAnd so looking at it here, I've got\nremote management is set to enabled,\n\n314\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.640\nand remote desktop is set to disable.\n\n315\n00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.900\nSo remote desktop they can't get into it,\nbut remote management is on,\n\n316\n00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.200\nwhat the heck is that?\n\n317\n00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.410\nWell that's talking about PowerShell\nremoting, or Win RM, that\n\n318\n00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:40.350\nyou can fire up PowerShell, and connect\nto a session with that technology and\n\n319\n00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.190\nstart to send commands\nvia the command line.\n\n320\n00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.630\nAnd that works great on servers that\nare core installs, but if you got a GUI,\n\n321\n00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.830\nthe remote desktop functionality\ncan be a little more convenient,\n\n322\n00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.140\nbecause you just see the desktop.\n\n323\n00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.640\nSo I can come in and I can turn that on,\nand get that set up for me, right?\n\n324\n00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.570\nSo I can come in and I can say,\nturn on remote desktop, and, so\n\n325\n00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.010\nright here I can choose.\n\n326\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.840\nBoy, that is getting really\nblurry on my screen.\n\n327\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.880\nMy resolution is so high that it's\ngetting blurry when I zoom in, so\n\n328\n00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.000\nI apologize for that.\n\n329\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.670\nBut I can say allow that remote desktop\nconnectivity, and then select users.\n\n330\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.330\nI can pick the user accounts that I want\nto allow to connect in, and then I can\n\n331\n00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.530\ntell Wes, hey if you wanna connect to that\nmachine I just brought it up for you.\n\n332\n00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.330\nHere's the IP address of the machine, and\n\n333\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.900\njust use remote desktop\nto connect up to it.\n\n334\n00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.460\nHere's your user name and password.\n\n335\n00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.820\nAnd now he can connect\nright into the guest and\n\n336\n00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.420\nhe doesn't have to worry\nabout the host underneath it.\n\n337\n00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.820\nHe doesn't even know about the host,\nnecessarily.\n\n338\n00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.020\nHe doesn't know if it's on VMWare or\nHyper-V or whatever.\n\n339\n00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.110\nHe just knows he remotes in and\nhe gets a Windows machine.\n\n340\n00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.670\nNow there's three main protocols out\nthere for remotely managing guests.\n\n341\n00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.570\nI've already mentioned one,\nwhich is remote desktop.\n\n342\n00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:44.680\nNow remote desktop on the exam may\nbe called out by its abbreviation,\n\n343\n00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.830\nwhich is RDP, Remote Desktop Protocol.\n\n344\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.310\nAn RDP uses TCP port 3389, and so\n\n345\n00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.790\nwe gotta have that open on the firewall,\nWes has to be able to use port 3389 to get\n\n346\n00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:58.320\nto this system to be able to pull up\nthat desktop and that's important.\n\n347\n00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.960\nBut that's just Windows,\nwhat if I have Linux boxes?\n\n348\n00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.880\nLinux boxes don't support RDP.\n\n349\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.110\nSo on Linux we've got two\nmain protocols that we use,\n\n350\n00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.860\nthese are the other two\nI wanted to mention.\n\n351\n00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.410\nSSH is the most common.\n\n352\n00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.500\nSSH is secured shell.\n\n353\n00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.010\nAnd I know I talked about SSH in\nanother episode because we had spun up\n\n354\n00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.180\na Amazon Web Services machine.\n\n355\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.410\nIt was the hardening episode,\n\n356\n00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.950\nwhere we talked about taking\nan operating system and hardening it.\n\n357\n00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:28.570\nI took a remote machine that was\nrunning Linux and I SSHed into it.\n\n358\n00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.540\nI wanted to get a shell\nconnection to that system so\n\n359\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.670\nthat I could login and\nmanage it, that's SSH, right.\n\n360\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.890\nIt's a great way to manage\nsystems that don't have a GUI.\n\n361\n00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:41.464\nBut if I install Linux and\nI install it with a GUI,\n\n362\n00:18:41.464 --> 00:18:45.550\nmaybe I want to see that, maybe I want\nto see the graphical user interface.\n\n363\n00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.070\nWell, there's a few options there.\n\n364\n00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.030\nOne of the most common ways to do it\nis to use a technology called VNC.\n\n365\n00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.460\nVNC is virtual network computing.\n\n366\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.040\nIt's kind of weird.\n\n367\n00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.820\nIt's free, but not free.\n\n368\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.070\nThere's paid versions of it.\n\n369\n00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.060\nThere's free versions of it.\n\n370\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.690\nIt's all weird licensing.\n\n371\n00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.780\nBut it came out of AT&T's Bell\nlabs forever ago, and\n\n372\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.120\nthey kinda released it out to the world,\nso a lot of people support VNC.\n\n373\n00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.890\nWhere you can remotely view the screen\n\n374\n00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.950\njust like Remote Desktop\ndoes with Microsoft.\n\n375\n00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.320\nNow, Remote Desktop with Microsoft\nworks really well and goes really fast.\n\n376\n00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.190\nVNC is definitely slow, but\nyou do see your screen.\n\n377\n00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.920\nSo if I were to spin up a Linux box and\n\n378\n00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.150\nit had a graphical user interface,\nI might choose to use VNC.\n\n379\n00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.955\nAnd just for your own reference,\nSSH uses TCP port 22,\n\n380\n00:19:27.955 --> 00:19:31.580\nVNC uses TCP port 5900 by default 5900.\n\n381\n00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:37.160\nSo again we've gotta make sure\nthat we've got that connectivity.\n\n382\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.480\nWhen I launch an instance here in Amazon,\nlike if I whip up one of these Linux\n\n383\n00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.199\nservers like I did in the other episode, I\ncan come through and specify what I want.\n\n384\n00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:50.150\nAnd as I get this thing configured and add\nstorage to it, and all that good stuff.\n\n385\n00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:55.130\nEventually, it's going to\nask me about my firewall.\n\n386\n00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.180\nAnd so I'm just going to go through and\nconfigure this.\n\n387\n00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.030\nAnd here is my firewall.\n\n388\n00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.720\nAnd see how it's allowing SSH by default.\n\n389\n00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.670\nSo there's that secure shell,\nTCP port 22, and\n\n390\n00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.010\nit's gonna allow me to be able\nto connect from anywhere.\n\n391\n00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.730\nI might need to change that and say, well,\nWes is working from home, Wes tells me\n\n392\n00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.710\nwhat his IP address is, and I add that, so\nthat it's just him that's being approved.\n\n393\n00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.290\nBut we need to make sure\nwe keep that under control,\n\n394\n00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:22.722\ncuz we don't want just any old person\nbeing able to connect up to this system.\n\n395\n00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:26.150\nAll right so I'm gonna go ahead and\nlet that one launch.\n\n396\n00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.640\nAnd then it's enabling certificate\nauthentication for me, so\n\n397\n00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.110\nit's just asking me to\npick my certificate.\n\n398\n00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.840\nI'll pick one that I've already got.\n\n399\n00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.190\nAll right so that's a Linux box there.\n\n400\n00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.650\nIf I do Windows it's kind\nof the same thing, right?\n\n401\n00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.880\nSo if I go back to my instances and\nI'll spin up a Windows instance this time.\n\n402\n00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.270\nSo I'm gonna go in here and\nI'll find Windows.\n\n403\n00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:45.010\nAnd I'll select that.\n\n404\n00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.220\nAnd I'll do the,\nbasically the same machine, right?\n\n405\n00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.990\nSame size, and\nthe other one was itprotvweb01,\n\n406\n00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.920\nI'll just make this on itprotvweb02.\n\n407\n00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.410\nAnd in the security group, see my default?\n\n408\n00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:05.210\nRDP, port 3389, that's what it's\nallowing through that firewall, right?\n\n409\n00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:08.960\nThat's gonna allow RDP traffic but\nif I want PowerShell,\n\n410\n00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.160\nwell I might need to add a rule and come\nin here and provide that functionality.\n\n411\n00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.040\nAnd they don't give me a default entry,\nso I would have to add it by hand, but\n\n412\n00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.060\nwe can put that in, and\nauthorize that connectivity to get in.\n\n413\n00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.550\nAnd like I said I think it's TCP port 137,\nif I remember right.\n\n414\n00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.040\nSo you can get that set up, and\nagain you'd wanna limit it so\n\n415\n00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.550\nthat only you had access.\n\n416\n00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.939\nBut we can go ahead and\ncreate that security group.\n\n417\n00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.600\nAnd so I'll create that.\n\n418\n00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.720\nAnd then we can deploy this machine.\n\n419\n00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.490\nLet me get rid of that junk rule and\nthat one's done.\n\n420\n00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.550\nAll right so\nonce I've got these machines created.\n\n421\n00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:46.550\nNow I wanna be able to connect in and\nwork with them.\n\n422\n00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.810\nAnd I think I've stalled long enough that\nthe Linux machine is probably ready.\n\n423\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:54.710\nRight so on my Linux machine here I\nprobably want to connect to it with SSH.\n\n424\n00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:58.290\nNow if you're on a Linux box yourself,\nor if you're on a Mac or\n\n425\n00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.529\nany kind of BSD system,\nyou've got SSH built in, it's there.\n\n426\n00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:04.570\nBut if you're on a Windows machine,\nSSH is not built into Windows.\n\n427\n00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.030\nFor whatever reason,\nMicrosoft hasn't added a client yet.\n\n428\n00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.250\nSo you're gonna need a third party client.\n\n429\n00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.850\nAnd there's plenty of good\nones that are out there.\n\n430\n00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.130\nThere's a great free one called PUTTY.\n\n431\n00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:14.340\nP-U-T-T-Y.\n\n432\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.840\nIt's free, you can download it,\ninstall it and it works great.\n\n433\n00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.960\nIt'll connect up to all sorts of systems.\n\n434\n00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.800\nIt's a useful tool, I usually install\nit just as part of my default install.\n\n435\n00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.860\nBut if I want to connect\nto this Linux box,\n\n436\n00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.610\nI just need an SSH client from somewhere.\n\n437\n00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:31.300\nNow I've already got one, so what I need\nto do is I need to copy its IP address,\n\n438\n00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.990\nso way down here at the bottom.\n\n439\n00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.110\nI'm gonna grab the IP\naddress of that machine.\n\n440\n00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.850\nAnd then I'm going to\ndrop into a terminal now.\n\n441\n00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:44.240\nI need the certificate to\nauthenticate with right?\n\n442\n00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.810\nAnd so I've got that kind of\nburied away in one of my folders,\n\n443\n00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.430\nwhich I just need to find real quick.\n\n444\n00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.260\nWhere did I park that?\n\n445\n00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.640\nThat would be in the,\n[LAUGH] 20 folders deep.\n\n446\n00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.470\nThere it is.\n\n447\n00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.730\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna do a quick SSH, and\n\n448\n00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.500\nwhat I'm doing is I need to\nprovide this certificate.\n\n449\n00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.190\nThis is the certificate that they're\nexpecting me to have to authenticate.\n\n450\n00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.020\nAnd so I'm gonna come in here and\n\n451\n00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.900\nI'll say ssh -i and\nI'm gonna provide that certificate.\n\n452\n00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.670\nAnd then I'm going to login with\nthe default user it created.\n\n453\n00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.820\nNow if I made the guest myself\nI'd pick who that user was.\n\n454\n00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.850\nBut in my case I used Amazon's template,\nand\n\n455\n00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.590\nAmazon's template uses this\nec2 user account by default.\n\n456\n00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.970\nAnd so I'm just gonna paste that in and\n\n457\n00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.650\nthe IP address of the server\nI'm connecting to.\n\n458\n00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.740\nAnd when I run that, it's going to\nreach out and try to connect to it.\n\n459\n00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.070\nHere, it shows that fingerprint for\nthe certificate, and\n\n460\n00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:41.320\nthen, now I'm connected,\nand I'm in that system.\n\n461\n00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.750\nSo, I'm on a Mac here,\nmy desktop is a Mac, but\n\n462\n00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.870\nnow in this shell, I'm on a Linux box.\n\n463\n00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.210\nRight?\nI'm remoted into it protv web 02.\n\n464\n00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.246\nThat's the server that I'm remoted into,\nand now I can start to work with it, and\n\n465\n00:23:53.246 --> 00:23:54.525\ndo all the things that I need to do.\n\n466\n00:23:54.525 --> 00:23:56.807\nMaybe I want to apply some updates, and\n\n467\n00:23:56.807 --> 00:24:01.036\nthere's a couple updates that\nare available, so I'll install those.\n\n468\n00:24:01.036 --> 00:24:03.633\nThen maybe I wanna make it a web server,\nand\n\n469\n00:24:03.633 --> 00:24:05.952\nall the other things that I want to do.\n\n470\n00:24:05.952 --> 00:24:08.855\nWe just start to do, right.\n\n471\n00:24:08.855 --> 00:24:13.090\nSo I'm gonna add a web server and\nPHP support.\n\n472\n00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.760\nRight, so it's gonna whip that up and\nnow I'm just working with a guest.\n\n473\n00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.170\nAt this point it doesn't\nmatter if this is physical or\n\n474\n00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.100\nvirtual, if it's local or remote.\n\n475\n00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.540\nI'm logged in and\nI'm working on the system.\n\n476\n00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.078\nRight, that's what SSH lets us do,\nget that shell and work with the computer.\n\n477\n00:24:26.078 --> 00:24:29.411\n>> Now, Don, we know that in\nthe Cloud+ you've taught and\n\n478\n00:24:29.411 --> 00:24:32.190\nspoken about hybrid scenarios, right?\n\n479\n00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:36.580\nAnd you just showed us how, when you\nhad to get into the Windows machine,\n\n480\n00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.950\nyou had to enable RDP.\n\n481\n00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:42.520\nNow, is the SSH daemon in Linux machine,\nis that turned on now?\n\n482\n00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.950\nI know you went through the Amazon way so\nthey're taking care of that.\n\n483\n00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:47.080\nI can only assume they're taking\ncare of it on the back end for you.\n\n484\n00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.580\nBut do you actually have to turn\nthat service on, or is it there and\n\n485\n00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.920\nready to go by default?\n\n486\n00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.830\n>> Almost every single Linux distro\nhas it turned on by default.\n\n487\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.540\nNot all, you can get some of those super\nhigh security ones where it might be\n\n488\n00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.040\nturned off, but\nmost of them have it turned on by default.\n\n489\n00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.410\nIf not, you may need to turn it on,\nright, part of that configuration.\n\n490\n00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.500\nLike I mentioned with\nthe Remote Desktop in Windows,\n\n491\n00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.510\nwhere I had to turn it on there\ncuz it's not on by default.\n\n492\n00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:11.370\nHere, it just was on by default, so\nyou've gotta understand your guest OS.\n\n493\n00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:15.510\nAnd speaking of Remote Desktop,\nthat Windows machine I spun up.\n\n494\n00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:16.210\nThe Windows machine,\n\n495\n00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.950\nif I wanna Remote Desktop into it,\nI got a little bit of a problem.\n\n496\n00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:24.100\nIf I create the VM myself,\nI can specify a username and a password.\n\n497\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.394\nAnd I can remote into it and access\nthat desktop and have that username and\n\n498\n00:25:27.394 --> 00:25:27.942\npassword.\n\n499\n00:25:27.942 --> 00:25:29.997\nBut I didn't create this one, Amazon did.\n\n500\n00:25:29.997 --> 00:25:31.913\nI don't know what the user name and\npassword is.\n\n501\n00:25:31.913 --> 00:25:35.453\nWell, in Windows you have a default user\nname of Administrator, so there's that.\n\n502\n00:25:35.453 --> 00:25:37.531\nBut I don't know what the password is and\nI need to find it out.\n\n503\n00:25:37.531 --> 00:25:41.250\nSo here in the web portal if I\ngo up to Actions and Connect,\n\n504\n00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:45.130\nit's got where it'll tell\nme what that password is.\n\n505\n00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.420\nAnd so here's the IP address to the\nsystem, my user name is Administrator and\n\n506\n00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.400\nI need Get that Password.\n\n507\n00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.000\nAnd when I get it, they need a way to\nauthenticate that I am who I say I am.\n\n508\n00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.260\nAnd so, the way we do that is\nby providing the key, right,\n\n509\n00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.310\nthe certificate key that we've got for\nour system.\n\n510\n00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:06.930\nAnd so, that certificate,\nI have parked in my show notes.\n\n511\n00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:11.390\nSo let me get to my show notes real\nquick and we'll bring that in.\n\n512\n00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.660\nAnd so I'm gonna find that\ncertificate right there.\n\n513\n00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.690\nAnd now it's gonna take that certificate,\nand it's gonna decrypt the password.\n\n514\n00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.700\nAnd here's my Administrator password,\nall right?\n\n515\n00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.570\nAnd once I've got that,\nnow I can go into Remote Desktop and\n\n516\n00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.420\nI'll be able to remote in and\nconnect to that system.\n\n517\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.400\nIn fact, it's even offering to give\nme a Remote Desktop file that's\n\n518\n00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.620\nalready configured for what I need.\n\n519\n00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:35.052\nAnd so I can just click on that,\nand it should launch for me.\n\n520\n00:26:35.052 --> 00:26:38.178\nI'm gonna use that operative word of\nshould because apparently it didn't.\n\n521\n00:26:41.893 --> 00:26:43.770\nAll right, well we'll do it\nthe old fashioned way then.\n\n522\n00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.050\nLet me jump over to\nMicrosoft's Remote Desktop protocol, and\n\n523\n00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.920\nI'll just add it in here by hand, right.\n\n524\n00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.010\nAnd so when I add in this entry,\n\n525\n00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:51.790\nI'm gonna say that I'm gonna\nlog in as administrator.\n\n526\n00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.750\nAnd I'm gonna paste in that\npassword that I just got.\n\n527\n00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.315\nNow I need to know the PC name,\nwhich I already don't remember.\n\n528\n00:26:58.315 --> 00:27:01.750\nBut they give it to me right here,\nso I can copy and paste that too.\n\n529\n00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.870\nAll the information I needed\nprovided right here, and\n\n530\n00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.280\nthis is what I can hand off\nto one of my end users.\n\n531\n00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.030\nThey could remote into this system and\n\n532\n00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:13.040\nthey wouldn't have to know\nanything at all about Amazon.\n\n533\n00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.010\nThey would just need to know that if\nthey want to connect to itprotv-web02,\n\n534\n00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.320\nhere's the DNS alias for it,\nhere's the user name, here's the password.\n\n535\n00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:25.338\nAnd once they've got it,\nnow they can take itprotv-web02,\n\n536\n00:27:25.338 --> 00:27:29.330\nclick on it, and\nit's gonna reach out and connect.\n\n537\n00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:34.670\nAnd once it connects, I'll be looking\nat the Windows desktop of that guest,\n\n538\n00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.340\nand not even have to worry\nabout Amazon being in the mix.\n\n539\n00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.660\nNow, it's taking a minute cuz of\nthe first time that I've logged in.\n\n540\n00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.160\nIn Windows, the first time you log in\nit's gotta create your profile and\n\n541\n00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.900\nall that stuff, so\nit's kinda doing that in the background.\n\n542\n00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.661\nSo I'm gonna see a black screen here for\na few moments.\n\n543\n00:27:46.661 --> 00:27:49.610\nBut as soon as it kinda gets right\n[LAUGH] it's gonna log me in and\n\n544\n00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:53.071\nI'll see where Amazon's even set\nthe wallpaper to have the host name and\n\n545\n00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:56.157\nstuff on there so I can see what it is and\nknow what that system is.\n\n546\n00:27:56.157 --> 00:27:59.750\nBut now I just start working\nwith it like normal, right?\n\n547\n00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:02.440\nThere we go, it's waiting for\nthat user profile service to start.\n\n548\n00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.560\nSo I'm gonna get into the system,\nand then I'll be working with it.\n\n549\n00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:10.400\nSo remote access in a Windows environment,\nif I have Hyper-V as the host and\n\n550\n00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.810\nI've got Windows guests, you can use\nRDP for everything across the board.\n\n551\n00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:18.875\nBut if you've got a Linux host or\na Linux guest, you'll want to use SSH for\n\n552\n00:28:18.875 --> 00:28:19.735\nthe most part.\n\n553\n00:28:19.735 --> 00:28:22.846\nThen even VMware and Citrix Xenserver,\n\n554\n00:28:22.846 --> 00:28:28.710\nyou can usually SSH into those hosts\nalso to get command line access to them.\n\n555\n00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:31.187\nBut they recommend you\nuse the graphical tools,\n\n556\n00:28:31.187 --> 00:28:34.108\nthose are what they really develop for.\n\n557\n00:28:34.108 --> 00:28:38.140\nSo, eventually this'll get me logged\nin and we'll get a chance to see it.\n\n558\n00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.770\nBut that's basically\nthe remote management side.\n\n559\n00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.610\nRemember, the biggest enemy to\nremote access are firewalls.\n\n560\n00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.360\nAnd I shouldn't say it's an enemy,\nit's a necessary thing,\n\n561\n00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.391\nyou've gotta have your firewalls.\n\n562\n00:28:47.391 --> 00:28:51.549\nBut you've got to make sure you open the\nappropriate access to let you remote in\n\n563\n00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:53.200\nand connect to these systems.\n\n564\n00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.410\nOtherwise, you can't use them, right,\nyou need a way to be able manage and\n\n565\n00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.600\ncontrol that.\n\n566\n00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.283\nAnd these are some of\nthe technologies that do that.\n\n567\n00:29:00.283 --> 00:29:03.667\nYeah, so now I'm logged into this Windows\nServer and my wallpaper hasn't updated,\n\n568\n00:29:03.667 --> 00:29:06.390\nthe fancy wallpaper, but\nmaybe that'll happen later.\n\n569\n00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.650\nBut if I go an pull up the properties\nof this system, here we go.\n\n570\n00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:16.880\nI can see I'm up in AWS, and I've got 8\ngigs of RAM, I've got a Xeon processor.\n\n571\n00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.290\nI can see that Windows is activated,\nthey took care of the licensing for me.\n\n572\n00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.740\nI've got this kinda generic\ncomputer name I might wanna change.\n\n573\n00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.950\nBut otherwise, I'm in here and\nI'm ready to make use of this system,\n\n574\n00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.285\nnot even having to worry about\nwhat the platform is underneath.\n\n575\n00:29:29.285 --> 00:29:31.900\n>> Very good, so see that there are,\nyou can definitely see that there\n\n576\n00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.830\nare different ways that we have to\nconnect to the hosts themselves.\n\n577\n00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:38.230\nSo pay attention to the vendor document\ncuz it's not a one size fits all here.\n\n578\n00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:39.950\nAnd you've also seen the same\nthing with a guest, right?\n\n579\n00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.800\nDifferent protocols are gonna be used,\ndifferent port numbers,\n\n580\n00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.900\npay attention to your firewalls.\n\n581\n00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.850\nAll great information, Don,\ngot anything else for us on this one?\n\n582\n00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:50.540\n>> The only other thing is, there are\nother management protocols that are out\n\n583\n00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:55.082\nthere that some people, some of you\nwatching right now might be like\n\n584\n00:29:55.082 --> 00:29:59.351\nI don't use that, I use,\nI don't know NX or Bomgar, or whatever.\n\n585\n00:29:59.351 --> 00:30:00.826\nAnd those are all great too,\nyou can use them.\n\n586\n00:30:00.826 --> 00:30:03.258\nI just wanted to focus on the ones\nthat are built into the system,\n\n587\n00:30:03.258 --> 00:30:04.622\nthe ones that are available there.\n\n588\n00:30:04.622 --> 00:30:08.311\nBut just be aware that when it comes to\nremote access to connecting these systems,\n\n589\n00:30:08.311 --> 00:30:10.503\nyou've just gotta look\nat what's supported and\n\n590\n00:30:10.503 --> 00:30:12.550\nlook at what those\nconfiguration needs are.\n\n591\n00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.150\n>> Very good, well,\n\n592\n00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.890\nit looks like we've come to the end of\nanother exciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n593\n00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.785\nThank you for watching,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n594\n00:30:18.785 --> 00:30:20.049\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n595\n00:30:20.049 --> 00:30:21.048\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n596\n00:30:21.048 --> 00:30:22.267\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n597\n00:30:22.267 --> 00:30:28.431\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.350\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\n\n4\n00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.660\nand we're going to be moving\nalong in our Cloud Plus series.\n\n5\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.445\nAnd specifically, we're gonna be\nlooking at security concepts today.\n\n6\n00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:25.254\nbBecause it is important that if\nyou got your data in the cloud,\n\n7\n00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:28.116\nwhether it be on-premise,\nwhether it be a hybrid of some sort,\n\n8\n00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:30.245\nyou need to make sure that\nthat data stays safe.\n\n9\n00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:32.730\nAnd we got Don Pezet here\nto help us out with that.\n\n10\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.910\nDon, how you doing today sir?\n\n11\n00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.710\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.850\nThanks for having me back on the show.\n\n13\n00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.390\nAnd yeah, just like Wes said,\nwe're gonna jump into security.\n\n14\n00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.430\nAnd this is where we kinda start to\ncross the streams between Cloud Plus and\n\n15\n00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.740\nsecurity plus.\n\n16\n00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.910\nWe know securing our local\ninfrastructure's important.\n\n17\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.750\nBut when you have a cloud infrastructure\nit's even more important.\n\n18\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.650\nEspecially if it's out there\nin Amazon Web Services where\n\n19\n00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.620\nyou don't control\nthe infrastructure underneath it.\n\n20\n00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.680\nSomebody else does.\n\n21\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.760\nAnd so there's security concerns we have.\n\n22\n00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.700\nThere's bad people out there.\n\n23\n00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.900\nThere's people that are going\nto try to get into your systems.\n\n24\n00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.070\nAnd even if there weren't,\n\n25\n00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.930\neven if everybody out there was just good\nnatured you've got other security issues.\n\n26\n00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.330\nLike failed hard drives, and things of\nthose nature that we have to worry about,\n\n27\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.130\nto make sure that our\nsystems stay online and\n\n28\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.110\navailable to our users when\nthey reach out to them.\n\n29\n00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.410\nSo what we've got in this episode and\nprobably in the next two episodes,\n\n30\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.800\nare really just a laundry\nlist of security concepts and\n\n31\n00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.490\nconcerns that we need to be aware of.\n\n32\n00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.210\nIf you're already Security+ certified I'm\nprobably not gonna shock you with anything\n\n33\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.440\nnew here, but I am going to show you\nsome cloud implementations that might be\n\n34\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.670\na little bit new for\nyou and it's good to see.\n\n35\n00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.989\nBut if you're not Security+ certified,\nthen this is really valuable cuz these\n\n36\n00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:40.003\nare concepts that CompTIA wants you to\nbe aware of prior to taking the exam.\n\n37\n00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:41.820\nNow the first one that I wanna talk about,\n\n38\n00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.610\nthe first topic that I wanna jump into\nare virtual private networks or VPNs.\n\n39\n00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.060\nIf you've got local servers and\nall of your end users are right there in\n\n40\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.100\nthe facility with your servers,\nthen VPNs mean nothing to you.\n\n41\n00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.020\nYou don't care about them,\nthey don't help you, and it's not useful.\n\n42\n00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.774\nBut if you're deploying cloud\ninfrastructure in the cloud,\n\n43\n00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:04.120\nif you're deploying servers in\nAmazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure,\n\n44\n00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.130\nGoogle Compute, Rackspace,\nany of the various places like that.\n\n45\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.762\nThen your end users are not likely in the\nfacility with the servers, because, well,\n\n46\n00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:14.150\nAmazon won't let you\nin their data centers.\n\n47\n00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.660\nSo, if we wanna get connectivity,\nwe've gotta connect via the Internet, and\n\n48\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.830\nthe Internet is not safe.\n\n49\n00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.100\nIt's not a secure network by default,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.330\nThe Internet is open, and\nthere's tons of people out there, and\n\n51\n00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.770\nyou have no idea who else is crossing\nthe network at the same time as you.\n\n52\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.830\nAnd so we need to secure our information.\n\n53\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.040\nNow most of you are probably familiar\nwith VPNs from use in other areas.\n\n54\n00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.450\nI've got a diagram here.\n\n55\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.200\nA lot of us use VPNs if\nwe have remote users, and\n\n56\n00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.730\nwe want them to connect via the Internet\nto something like our headquarters, right?\n\n57\n00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.210\nIt could be a branch office too, but\n\n58\n00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.410\nusually it's just remote users, somebody's\non a laptop, they're at a hotel and\n\n59\n00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.690\nthey wanna connect back to the office and\naccess resources, right.\n\n60\n00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.510\nSo what do they do?\n\n61\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.430\nThey build a VPN tunnel.\n\n62\n00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.280\nA VPN tunnel between their laptop and\nmaybe it's a firewall at your location.\n\n63\n00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.200\nMaybe it's a remote access\nserver like this one,\n\n64\n00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.550\nsomething that's specifically designed for\nVPNs.\n\n65\n00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.150\nIt just depends on your implementation\nhow that's going to work.\n\n66\n00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.600\nBut you build a secure tunnel across\nthe Internet so that your data in\n\n67\n00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.740\nencrypted and protected as it travels\nacross this non-secure network.\n\n68\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.540\nIt's a very valuable thing.\n\n69\n00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.640\nIf you're running a private cloud, and\n\n70\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.870\nyou're wanting to provide\nservices to your end users,\n\n71\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.650\nyou'll want them to VPN in to your\nlocation, so they can get secure access.\n\n72\n00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.330\nNow if it's something like a web server,\nyou can use technologies like SSL, and\n\n73\n00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.530\nwe'll talk about that later,\nto encrypt your web traffic.\n\n74\n00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.730\nBut if it's email traffic,\nfile servers, technologies like that\n\n75\n00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.980\nthat don't necessarily use web protocols,\nthey become a lot harder to secure.\n\n76\n00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.200\nThe good part about a VPN\nis it encrypts everything.\n\n77\n00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.720\nEverything that passes between you and\nthe other network.\n\n78\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.530\nAnd that's really valuable, cuz now we\ndon't have to worry about individual\n\n79\n00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.680\nports and protocols,\nwe can just send everything across it.\n\n80\n00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.790\nNow I know what you're thinking.\n\n81\n00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.510\nDon, this is great, we love VPNs, but\nhow does this apply to cloud computing?\n\n82\n00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.610\nWell, let's say that I decide I'm\ngonna move my company into the cloud.\n\n83\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.330\nSo we start putting out servers\nup in Microsoft Azure or\n\n84\n00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.490\nAmazon Web Services or Google Compute,\nor wherever we choose to put it, right?\n\n85\n00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.170\nWell, that's out on the Internet.\n\n86\n00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.190\nSo now everybody at my headquarters\nis gonna have to cross\n\n87\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.560\nthe Internet to get there.\n\n88\n00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.107\nAnd my branch offices and my customers,\n\n89\n00:04:19.107 --> 00:04:21.440\neverybody's gonna have to cross\nthe Internet to get there.\n\n90\n00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.678\nWell all of the big cloud providers,\nMicrosoft and Azure,\n\n91\n00:04:25.678 --> 00:04:30.240\nMicrosoft and Amazon,\nthere we go, the other company.\n\n92\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.196\nThey all provide VPN service where you\ncan have a firewall or a router or\n\n93\n00:04:35.196 --> 00:04:39.984\neven a server at your headquarters\nthat builds a VPN tunnel up to your\n\n94\n00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:43.520\nAzure environment or\nup to your AWS environment.\n\n95\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.145\nAnd when that tunnel is built up,\n\n96\n00:04:45.145 --> 00:04:48.745\nnow when anybody in your headquarters\nwants to get to a server up in Azure,\n\n97\n00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:52.868\nthey can cross that encrypted tunnel and\nthat's really important cuz you might have\n\n98\n00:04:52.868 --> 00:04:57.290\nsomething like an Active Directory domain\ncontroller, like this guy right here.\n\n99\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.230\nAnd if I have a domain controller,\nthat's sensitive data.\n\n100\n00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.000\nI've got usernames and passwords and\nall sorts of good information right there.\n\n101\n00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.370\nThat's an attacker's dream.\n\n102\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.190\nThey wanna get into that server.\n\n103\n00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.228\nIf I have a domain controller\nup here in Azure also, well,\n\n104\n00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:12.134\nI need to be able to synchronize between\nthe domain controller and Azure and\n\n105\n00:05:12.134 --> 00:05:15.111\nthe domain controller that's\nhere in my headquarters.\n\n106\n00:05:15.111 --> 00:05:18.311\nAnd to do that,\nI gotta cross the Internet.\n\n107\n00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:23.091\nSo now I've got sensitive data, data that\nI know is sensitive crossing the Internet.\n\n108\n00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:27.394\nIf I can build a VPN tunnel between\nmyself and Azure, now I've got a secure\n\n109\n00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:31.431\nconnection between me and\nthe Azure environment or AWS or wherever.\n\n110\n00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:34.964\nAnd when we build that up,\nnow all my traffic can flow across it and\n\n111\n00:05:34.964 --> 00:05:36.840\nI get security and benefits.\n\n112\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.240\nSo VPNs are important for\ncloud infrastructure,\n\n113\n00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.480\njust as much as they are for accessing\nlocal resources in your environment.\n\n114\n00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.420\n>> So Don, let me ask you a question here.\n\n115\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.530\nKinda going back to the Security+ idea.\n\n116\n00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.110\nWe have that CIA triad, right?\n\n117\n00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.370\nConfidentiality, integrity and\navailability.\n\n118\n00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.580\nAnd integrity,\nmaking sure that the data is not modified.\n\n119\n00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.523\nAvailability, obviously we want our\nusers to be able to access our data or\n\n120\n00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.620\nall productivity is lost.\n\n121\n00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.400\nBut in the confidentiality part,\nthis gives us the encryption,\n\n122\n00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.740\nthat secure in transit from our on\npremise location to the cloud location.\n\n123\n00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.530\nIs that correct?\n\n124\n00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.880\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\nit's really in totality, right?\n\n125\n00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.390\nAny of your data that's in\nmotion between those locations\n\n126\n00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.580\nis being encrypted and secured.\n\n127\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.160\nNow, you get to pick the encryption.\n\n128\n00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.930\nWe're gonna talk about that later on.\n\n129\n00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.430\nSo you could pick weak encryption and\n\n130\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.470\nthen you're kinda shooting\nyourself in the foot.\n\n131\n00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.540\nBut you could pick very strong encryption,\ntoo,\n\n132\n00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.180\nand now you've got a very reliable and\nsecure connection.\n\n133\n00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.541\nIt's definitely something to think about.\n\n134\n00:06:27.541 --> 00:06:31.385\nAnd I know just coincidentally,\nthey're filming an Active Directory and\n\n135\n00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:35.420\nAzure show over in the other studio\nright now, if you're watching this live.\n\n136\n00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.360\nBut if you're not watching it live it's\nalready available on the set, I'm sure.\n\n137\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.320\nAnd they're actually showing how to build\nup that VPN and set that up for Azure, but\n\n138\n00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.890\nthe same thing applies to other services\nlike AWS and they make it really easy.\n\n139\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.440\nIn fact, Amazon has some neat stuff.\n\n140\n00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.500\nLet me go to Amazon's website.\n\n141\n00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.510\n>> And while you do that, I do have one\nother question that I was thinking about.\n\n142\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.700\nWhen we talk about hybrid,\n\n143\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.690\nas you've talked about it on other\nepisodes here in Cloud Plus.\n\n144\n00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.240\nWe talked about that hybrid deployment\nwhere we need the on premise but\n\n145\n00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.890\nwe also maybe need to put some of\nthat information in the cloud.\n\n146\n00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.790\nWill this still qualify as some of the\nvarious security standards are out there\n\n147\n00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.240\nfor information protection and stuff?\n\n148\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.200\nWill this still give us that kind\nof compliance if we need it to?\n\n149\n00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.200\n>> It certainly can.\n\n150\n00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.718\nAnd so, what Wes is talking about is you\nmight have government regulations you have\n\n151\n00:07:14.718 --> 00:07:15.230\nto follow.\n\n152\n00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.490\nIf you have medical records,\nyou have HIPAA compliance to follow.\n\n153\n00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.130\nAnd they mandate a certain\nlevel of encryption.\n\n154\n00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.280\nJust having a VPN tunnel is not enough.\n\n155\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.200\nBut having a VPN tunnel that's\nconfigured properly, right,\n\n156\n00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.400\nthat's configured to use the right\nlevel of encryption, that's enough.\n\n157\n00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.620\nAnd that can provide that level.\n\n158\n00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.550\nSo it's one piece of that puzzle\nthat you've gotta have for\n\n159\n00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.620\nthe total confidentiality.\n\n160\n00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.990\n>> Very good.\n\n161\n00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.510\n>> All right,\nwell I'm logged into my AWS console here.\n\n162\n00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.960\nAnd when you go into AWS,\nwe can jump into EC2 and\n\n163\n00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.450\nwe can start spinning up instances.\n\n164\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.030\nI can spin up servers\nto my heart's content.\n\n165\n00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.640\nAnd if I want my local\nservers to connect to these,\n\n166\n00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.170\nthey're going to have to connect\nvia the Internet, right?\n\n167\n00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:57.085\nSo what I can do is I can create what's\ncalled a virtual private network,\n\n168\n00:07:57.085 --> 00:08:00.720\nlike a VPN, and\na virtual private connection or a VPC.\n\n169\n00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.160\nI'm sorry, virtual private cloud, VPC.\n\n170\n00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.904\nAnd so if I scroll down here,\nI can find those VPCs right here,\n\n171\n00:08:05.904 --> 00:08:07.713\nthe virtual private clouds.\n\n172\n00:08:07.713 --> 00:08:13.720\nAnd I can create a private cloud and I can\nestablish a VPN connection with it, right?\n\n173\n00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.480\nSo if I come in here and I'll just run\nthe start a VPN Wizard, and I'm going to\n\n174\n00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.160\ncreate one, and it's going to ask me and\nwhat IP range I want to use in this block.\n\n175\n00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.860\nWell, here at ITPRO.TV like in our studio,\n\n176\n00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.530\nwe've got 10.1.230.0 is our\nkind of network, as /24.\n\n177\n00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:37.357\nSo maybe I want to do 10.1.240.0/24,\nright?\n\n178\n00:08:37.357 --> 00:08:40.060\nSo I'm going to pick a different range,\n\n179\n00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.110\nand why is it,\nI'm outside of my public subnet.\n\n180\n00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.860\nWell, I just need to change that.\n\n181\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:52.500\nSo basically I'm just going to adjust this\na little bit, and what am I doing, sorry.\n\n182\n00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.980\nMy cider block, that's the whole network,\n\n183\n00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.780\nit's asked me what of that cider block\nI want to make available publicly.\n\n184\n00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.540\nRight?\nWhat do I want to make available to DNS?\n\n185\n00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.660\nIf this is a truly private one, I might\nnot want to make any of it available.\n\n186\n00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.120\nI might want to make the whole\nthing available publicly.\n\n187\n00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.495\nIt's kind of up to me\nhow I want to do that.\n\n188\n00:09:09.495 --> 00:09:12.050\nYou can flag them all,\nas being publicly available,\n\n189\n00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.925\nbecause then you got a firewall that will\nsee you in a minute that you configure\n\n190\n00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:17.395\nthat dictates who is actually available.\n\n191\n00:09:17.395 --> 00:09:19.885\nSo I'm just going to settle this all\nof them even though I'm going to gate\n\n192\n00:09:19.885 --> 00:09:21.185\nthat a little bit later.\n\n193\n00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:24.065\nAnd so I might call this my ITProTV-vpc,\n\n194\n00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:27.195\nthat's my virtual private\ncloud that I'm creating.\n\n195\n00:09:27.195 --> 00:09:30.205\nAnd we can give that subnet\na name if we have more than one,\n\n196\n00:09:30.205 --> 00:09:31.375\nlike this might be my DMC.\n\n197\n00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:35.190\nMaybe this is just\na fraction of that network.\n\n198\n00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.590\nSo maybe I create a /26 and\nI'll start this at maybe 192,\n\n199\n00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.450\nis that where that would start?\n\n200\n00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.350\nYes, so if I do a small\npiece of that network and so\n\n201\n00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.760\nI'm saying let me take just\nthe last 25% of that IP range and\n\n202\n00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.370\nI'll make that publicly available and\nI'll call that my DMZ.\n\n203\n00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.921\nBut the rest of it is just\ngoing to be the itprotc-vpc,\n\n204\n00:09:55.921 --> 00:10:00.270\nnow I'm going to rename that to be\na little more meaningful to me, all right.\n\n205\n00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.910\nOnce I got that, we can specify\nother information if we need it.\n\n206\n00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.300\nI really don't need any\nof the other things, so\n\n207\n00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.650\nwhy don't you go ahead and create it.\n\n208\n00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:11.660\nAnd I'm creating a virtual\nnetwork up in AWS, right?\n\n209\n00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.140\nFor public IPs,\nI can get to those via the internet, but\n\n210\n00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.290\nwhat about the ones that I\nmade that weren't public?\n\n211\n00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:17.850\nThey're not public.\n\n212\n00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:18.820\nHow do I get to them?\n\n213\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.370\nThe short answer is you can't.\n\n214\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.160\nThey're up in Amazon, they're not public,\n\n215\n00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.640\nyou can't get to them until\nyou create a VPN tunnel.\n\n216\n00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.405\nSo if I look over here at my VPC\ndashboard, way down on the bottom,\n\n217\n00:10:30.405 --> 00:10:32.935\nyou'll see VPN connections.\n\n218\n00:10:32.935 --> 00:10:35.715\nThere's actually a couple\nof different ways to do it.\n\n219\n00:10:35.715 --> 00:10:39.435\nThere's customer gateways, virtual\nprivate gateways, and VPN connections.\n\n220\n00:10:39.435 --> 00:10:42.615\nAnd VPN connections,\nthat's what most of us are going to use.\n\n221\n00:10:42.615 --> 00:10:48.296\nIf you go into VPN connections, you'll see\nwhere you can create a VPN connection.\n\n222\n00:10:48.296 --> 00:10:51.120\nAnd it's going to ask you a little bit\nabout the equipment that you have on your\n\n223\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.250\nend, I haven't set up a gateway yet,\nshoot.\n\n224\n00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.570\nBut it'll ask you a little bit about\nthe equipment you've got on your end,\n\n225\n00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.520\nif you've got a Cisco router or firewall,\nif you've got this device or that device.\n\n226\n00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.220\nAnd it'll provide you with\nthe configuration you need\n\n227\n00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.990\nto put on that device\nto build up the tunnel.\n\n228\n00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.510\nIf I come in and\nwhip up a gateway here, so\n\n229\n00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:13.570\nyou know I call this ITProTV gateway,\nall right.\n\n230\n00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.420\nSo we'll just whip that gateway up.\n\n231\n00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.540\nThere we go.\nSo I've got a gateway in place and\n\n232\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.550\nI can attach that to my VPC.\n\n233\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.860\nSo I will attach that to my VPC.\n\n234\n00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.480\nAnd then I can build\na VPN connection to it.\n\n235\n00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.960\nVPN into the virtual private cloud right.\n\n236\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.460\nSo there it goes attaching, and\n\n237\n00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.880\nI should be able to create my\nconnections while it's attaching.\n\n238\n00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.380\nWe'll see.\nYep, there we go.\n\n239\n00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.250\nAlright, so now I can come in and\nI can create that gateway.\n\n240\n00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.840\nAnd that's pretty neat because once I\nbuild on that VPN connection on my side I\n\n241\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.450\ncan connect and now my local systems can\nsee these servers that are hosted up in\n\n242\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.630\nthe cloud even though they\ndon't have public IPs,\n\n243\n00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.510\neven though they aren't\npublicly available.\n\n244\n00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.850\nRight.\nI made 25% of the Ips available publicly,\n\n245\n00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.600\nbut the other 75% will only be\nable to see via this VPN tunnel.\n\n246\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.680\nSo I call this my ITproTV-VPN.\n\n247\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.140\nAnd I'll attach it to that gateway.\n\n248\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.610\nThis is a new gateway, and I need to\nspecify the IP address of my end.\n\n249\n00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.956\nSo like here at the studio,\nthat's our building IP.\n\n250\n00:12:11.956 --> 00:12:14.720\nAnd it's going to use border gateway\nprotocol which, let me tell you,\n\n251\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.200\ndefinitely makes this difficult to set up.\n\n252\n00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.070\nI like Azure's way of setting up better,\nbut in AWS they use BGP,\n\n253\n00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.280\nwhich is annoying so\nI'll leave it at that one.\n\n254\n00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.820\nAnd we'll go ahead and create that.\n\n255\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.540\nAnd when it's done, it's going to build\nit up and then I'll be able to view\n\n256\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.740\nthe configuration settings to be able to\napply that on my own side to get that.\n\n257\n00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.180\nSee how it's got this nice big download\nconfiguration button, right, and as soon\n\n258\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.850\nas that goes from pending to complete,\nwhich can take a little while sometimes.\n\n259\n00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.030\nIt's actually spinning up a little micro\ninstance on the back end to drive this and\n\n260\n00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.630\nthat takes a few minutes to come up.\n\n261\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.870\nBut when it's done,\nactually it's letting me do it already,\n\n262\n00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:48.950\nI can download a configuration.\n\n263\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.960\nSee how it's asking me what\nvendor of equipment do I have.\n\n264\n00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.320\nDo I have Cisco, Fortinet, Generic,\nJuniper, Palo Alto, whatever it is.\n\n265\n00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.630\nAll right.\nSo maybe I've got Cisco.\n\n266\n00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.710\nAnd what platform do I have?\n\n267\n00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.210\nWell, they only split their routers\nin the IOS version that I've got and\n\n268\n00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.850\nonce I specify that,\nthen I can download it, and\n\n269\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:11.170\nwhen I download it, it's going to\ngive me everything I need for that.\n\n270\n00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.770\nLet's fire this file up so\nwe can kind of see it.\n\n271\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.720\nAnd there we go.\n\n272\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.800\nAnd so what they're doing is\nthey're giving us a configuration.\n\n273\n00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.070\nThis is a Cisco router configuration,\nbasically the list of commands necessary\n\n274\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.030\nto set up the VPN tunnel and\nyou'll see it's fully documented.\n\n275\n00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.460\nSo I can read through this,\ndetermine what settings I need to change,\n\n276\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.770\nget them put in place,\nand once they're in place,\n\n277\n00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.830\nnow I'll be able to connect my\nlocal environment up to there.\n\n278\n00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.520\nAnd, I mean, you guys probably saw as I\nscrolled through, there's a lot in here.\n\n279\n00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.520\nYou've got to read through it.\n\n280\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.298\nThis is not a cut and paste job by itself.\n\n281\n00:13:45.298 --> 00:13:47.910\nYou've got to read through, because\nthere's multiple things you'll have more\n\n282\n00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.870\nthan one example, you have to pick the\nexample that's right and paste that in.\n\n283\n00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.920\nBut they do help you to find that and\nget it set up.\n\n284\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.900\nAnd that builds that tunnel so\n\n285\n00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:01.850\nwe end up with an environment like this,\nwhere you've got your headquarters and\n\n286\n00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.930\nthen it can connect via VPN and\nup into the cloud environment.\n\n287\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.570\nAnd now you've got a secure\nconnection between you and them.\n\n288\n00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.630\nNow VPNs are great if you can\nconfigure them and get them set up.\n\n289\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.150\nBut your traffic is still\ncrossing the Internet and\n\n290\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.910\nthat means your data is still at risk\nif you use a weak encryption protocol.\n\n291\n00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.730\nIn theory, someone could compromise\nthat and start decrypting your data, or\n\n292\n00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.310\nif they get a hold of your keys.\n\n293\n00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.380\nSo if you're really hardcore, right?\n\n294\n00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.186\nLet's say security is the utmost\nconcern in your organization,\n\n295\n00:14:28.186 --> 00:14:30.750\nyou might want to even do this.\n\n296\n00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.050\nAnd so some of the providers\noffer an alternative.\n\n297\n00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.220\nLet me go back out to my main AWS console.\n\n298\n00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.570\nI just went into VPCs,\nthat's that Virtual Private Cloud.\n\n299\n00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.310\nBut you've also got Direct Connect.\n\n300\n00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.580\nWith Direct Connect,\nwhat you can do Is you can go out and\n\n301\n00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.570\nyou can buy a landline, right?\n\n302\n00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.400\nUsually an MPLS circuit or\na fiber optic connection of some sort\n\n303\n00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.720\ndirectly from your building\nto an AWS data center.\n\n304\n00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.920\nYou can actually have a private\nnon-internet connection, a point\n\n305\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.670\nto point private leased line between\nyour building and Amazon Web services.\n\n306\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.740\nObviously, it's going\nto cost you some money.\n\n307\n00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.320\nYou got to pay it from the line on\nyour end and the you have to pay for\n\n308\n00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.320\nit on the line on Amazon's end.\n\n309\n00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.650\nThey have only have a couple\nof approved vendors.\n\n310\n00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.360\nSo when you go in to create\none of these connections,\n\n311\n00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.150\nif I go to create a connection, I have\nto pick where I'm going to connect and\n\n312\n00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.800\nif you look,\nyou'll see where I'm being limited.\n\n313\n00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.680\nRight now I'm tied to\nthe North Virginia region.\n\n314\n00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.830\nRight, which is the US east data center.\n\n315\n00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.340\nAnd so they're saying in US East,\nif I want to connect to them\n\n316\n00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.850\nI've got two choice, I guess three\nchoices, but two of them are Equinix.\n\n317\n00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.630\nSo I can use Equinix through Ashburn,\nVirginia or\n\n318\n00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.110\nTexas, or I can use Core Site\nthrough New York and that's it.\n\n319\n00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.420\nThose are my two choices.\n\n320\n00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.660\nSo I would have to buy a MPLS circuit or\n\n321\n00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.420\nwhatever point to point kind of line I\nwanted to use from one of those vendors if\n\n322\n00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.930\nI wanted to get connected and that\nwould be the vendor on the Amazon side.\n\n323\n00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.660\nOn my side, I might be able to use other\nvendors or I might have to use them.\n\n324\n00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.980\nIt just depends.\n\n325\n00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.898\nIf you switch regions, so like if I jump\nover to US West, let's go to California.\n\n326\n00:16:06.898 --> 00:16:09.599\nIf I switch over to California,\nit might not even be offered over there,\n\n327\n00:16:09.599 --> 00:16:10.608\nI'm not sure.\n\n328\n00:16:10.608 --> 00:16:11.479\nIt is offered.\n\n329\n00:16:11.479 --> 00:16:14.487\nSo it is offered, there but\nyou'll see that now it's Equinix and\n\n330\n00:16:14.487 --> 00:16:17.958\nCoreSite in San Jose, California and\nLos Angeles, California, right?\n\n331\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:23.330\nI've got to buy those lines, but I can\nget a gig or 10 gig line between me and\n\n332\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.290\nthem, and now not only do I have\na dedicated connection, but security\n\n333\n00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.540\nbecomes far less of a concern, because\nthis isn't costing the Internet anymore.\n\n334\n00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.190\nSo, that's always an option too.\n\n335\n00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.220\nRemember, that when your\ndata is in the cloud,\n\n336\n00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.980\nyou can have really sensitive information,\n\n337\n00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.910\nlike domain controllers replicating across\nthat line, and VPN tunnels are great, but\n\n338\n00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.880\nyou just can't beat a dedicated line,\nassuming you've got the budget for it.\n\n339\n00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.510\n>> Very good.\nSo, once our information is in\n\n340\n00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.120\nthat tunnel, and it's crossing\nthe Internet, we can provide it.\n\n341\n00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.220\nWe've got it set up, right?\n\n342\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.640\nWe've used the right encryption protocols\nwe can be fairly confident that it is\n\n343\n00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.730\nsecure, but we still have data that's\nflowing in and out of our networks and\n\n344\n00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.280\nthat's going to be something that we need\nto screen and make sure that that traffic\n\n345\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.970\nis approved, regardless of whether\nit's encrypted or not, right?\n\n346\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:03.700\n>> Absolutely.\n\n347\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.660\nAnd that's where our other network\ninfrastructure only comes in.\n\n348\n00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.530\nWhen you have a local network, think\nabout the devices that you normally have.\n\n349\n00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:13.740\nYou have firewalls, IDS, and\nIPS boxes and that kind of stuff, right?\n\n350\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.030\nWell, in a virtual environment,\nyou still have those same elements.\n\n351\n00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.410\nIn most cases,\nit's still the same exact hardware.\n\n352\n00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.890\nSo let's talk a little\nbit about each of those.\n\n353\n00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.240\nAll right, let's start with firewalls.\n\n354\n00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.198\nFirewalls are essential.\n\n355\n00:17:23.198 --> 00:17:27.945\nYou've got to have a firewall between you\nand the outside world, because the server\n\n356\n00:17:27.945 --> 00:17:33.100\nvendors no matter how hard they try,\nthey always got more stuff turned on\n\n357\n00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:38.120\nthen you actually need, because when\nMicrosoft creates a window install or\n\n358\n00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.160\nred hat creates a Linux install or\napple creates a MAC OS install or\n\n359\n00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.600\nwhatever, they try to create\na install that's good for\n\n360\n00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:49.170\nthe most common denominator for most\npeople, but your needs maybe different.\n\n361\n00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:49.980\nAnd so\n\n362\n00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.740\nwith a firewall we can stick it in between\nyour server in the real world and and we\n\n363\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.600\ncan restrict to the communications they're\nallowed to what just we need, right?\n\n364\n00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.472\nSo for example let's say I\ninstall a debian server,\n\n365\n00:18:03.472 --> 00:18:06.120\ndebian's pretty secure, right?\n\n366\n00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.300\nWith its default install, it doesn't\nhave a lot of fluff added to it.\n\n367\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.730\nIt's not like Ubuntu that\nhas a ton of fluff on it.\n\n368\n00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:16.740\nBut Debian's a little bit better,\nCentOS and Redhat, they're even better.\n\n369\n00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.710\nBut all of them accept\nincoming SSH connections.\n\n370\n00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.240\nThey all allow you to SSH into them\ncoming from any IP as a source.\n\n371\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.710\nSo that means if I bring one\nof these up on the internet,\n\n372\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.690\nanybody in the entire world can try and\nopen up a SSH connection.\n\n373\n00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.640\nThey might not have a username and\npassword, but they can try and connect,\n\n374\n00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.020\nand they can try and\nbrute force it, right?\n\n375\n00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.430\nSo what we need is a firewall\nin place that says yeah,\n\n376\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.630\nwe're going to let SSH come in,\nbut only from these source IPs.\n\n377\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.670\nAnd you can put the IP addresses of your\noffice or the building that you work from\n\n378\n00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.720\nor whatever,\nyou can limit it down to just that.\n\n379\n00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.450\nAnd so that's a important piece.\n\n380\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.760\nWe can have a hardware firewall or\na software firewall.\n\n381\n00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.650\nI know in my saddle little diagram here,\nlet me show you one.\n\n382\n00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.390\nI usually show a hardware\nfirewall like this, right?\n\n383\n00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.845\nSo I've got the Internet out there.\n\n384\n00:19:01.845 --> 00:19:03.710\nI\\ve got a local area network and DMZ.\n\n385\n00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.810\nAnd I've got this hardware\nfirewall in place and\n\n386\n00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.520\nthat works great when\nit's right here with you.\n\n387\n00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.030\nBut what if it's up in AWS?\n\n388\n00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.750\nRight?\nAre you going to call up Amazon and say,\n\n389\n00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.190\nhey, can you stick this\nfirewall in there for me?\n\n390\n00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.270\nNo, you really can't do that.\n\n391\n00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.380\nAnd so,\nwhat you're left with are two options.\n\n392\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.565\nYou're left with firewall\nservices through the vendor,\n\n393\n00:19:21.565 --> 00:19:26.870\nOo you're left with firewall services\nas software on top of your server.\n\n394\n00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.890\nEvery server these days has\na software firewall built into it.\n\n395\n00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.450\nSo for example if you're on\na Windows server like this one.\n\n396\n00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.110\nWhoops, [LAUGH] which I just blocked.\n\n397\n00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.590\nIf you're on a Windows server, it's got\nthe Windows firewall built into it.\n\n398\n00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.610\nAnd so you can launch this crazy thing and\n\n399\n00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.110\ngo into Windows Firewall Advanced\nSecurity, and you can see all these\n\n400\n00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:50.360\nrules for inbound traffic and outbound\ntraffic and what's allowed in and out.\n\n401\n00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.560\nAll right?\n\n402\n00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.920\nIn a Linux system, you'd have IP tables.\n\n403\n00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.180\nAnd IP tables would be up and running,\nand filtering traffic coming in and\n\n404\n00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.590\nout of the system.\n\n405\n00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.940\nSoftware firewalls are great,\nthey're effective, right?\n\n406\n00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.500\nBut there's a problem\nwith software firewalls.\n\n407\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.080\nThe attacker has already made it to\nyour server at that point, right?\n\n408\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.680\nSo the attacker is passed from\nthe Internet to your server and\n\n409\n00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.810\nthey're being blocked at the server, so\nif there's any weakness at the server,\n\n410\n00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.350\nthey're already there.\n\n411\n00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:23.040\nIf we can stop them before they get\nto the server, that's even better.\n\n412\n00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.070\nAnd so what are some of\nthe ways that we can do that?\n\n413\n00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:29.180\nWell, usually hardware firewalls or\nfirewall services through a vendor.\n\n414\n00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.890\nSo if I take Amazon Web Services,\nfor example.\n\n415\n00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:38.725\nSo if I jump back here into AWS and\nget the world smallest font.\n\n416\n00:20:38.725 --> 00:20:40.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n417\n00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.000\nAnd I jump into EC2 and\nI start spinning up an instance, right.\n\n418\n00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.240\nAnd so let me just jump in here and\nI'll whip up a Linux box.\n\n419\n00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:53.400\nSo I'm going to launch an instance and\nlet me pick a particular instance.\n\n420\n00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.500\nLet's see.\n\n421\n00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.970\nAll right, so I'm going to search for\na particular image here.\n\n422\n00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.870\nLet me just bring up one of\nthe Amazon Linux images and\n\n423\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:04.850\nwe'll get one of these fired up.\n\n424\n00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.720\nAnd I'm just going to accept\nthe defaults on this.\n\n425\n00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.590\nI'm not really going to change anything.\n\n426\n00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.060\nSo as I move forward,\nit's going to ask a bunch of questions.\n\n427\n00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.150\nI'm just going to keep\nhitting next on this thing.\n\n428\n00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.790\nAnd the only I am going to change is the\nname so I can remember what it is, right?\n\n429\n00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.870\nSo I'll just call this itprotv-web01.\n\n430\n00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.960\nSo this would be a web server for\nmy system, right?\n\n431\n00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.480\nAnd as I go to configure it,\nhere I get to the security group.\n\n432\n00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.100\nNow what's a security group?\n\n433\n00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.580\nIn AWS, a security group is a software\nfirewall, but it's a firewall that doesn't\n\n434\n00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:37.870\nrun on the VM itself, it's a firewall\nthat runs on Amazon's infrastructure\n\n435\n00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.550\nthat they let me filter that traffic\nbefore it gets to the instance.\n\n436\n00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.780\nBut the default is that SSH is\nallowing traffic from anywhere.\n\n437\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.960\nSo what we want to do is we want\nto take that and restrict it back.\n\n438\n00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.600\nI want SSH into this box to manage it.\n\n439\n00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.770\nBut just from my office,\njust from right here.\n\n440\n00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.740\nNot from the whole world, right?\n\n441\n00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.740\nSo we need to know to restrict that.\n\n442\n00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.290\nAnd I can do IP tables right in\nthe VM itself, that's great.\n\n443\n00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.450\nOr I can use the security\ngroup right here and so\n\n444\n00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:07.050\nthat's what I'm going to do is here, if I\ntake that where it says SSH TCP port 22,\n\n445\n00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:10.570\nway over here the source\nis set to anywhere.\n\n446\n00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.550\nI can drop that down and\nI can choose my IP and\n\n447\n00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.560\nit will figure out what my\npublic IP is right now.\n\n448\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.210\nAnd so there it is.\n\n449\n00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.120\nThat's our studio IP address.\n\n450\n00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.610\nOr I can even do a range, right.\n\n451\n00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.570\nWe actually have more IPs than that.\n\n452\n00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.450\nIf I wanted it to be the whole studio,\n\n453\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:31.280\nI would actually need to say\nsomething like 209.251.159.176/28.\n\n454\n00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.570\nI believe is what we have.\n\n455\n00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:37.620\nThere and so now it would be\nthe whole studio, all of our IPs and\n\n456\n00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.900\nwe'd be kind of covered and\nbe able to SSH into this box.\n\n457\n00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.550\nAt the same time, I want people to\nbe able to browse through this thing\n\n458\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.330\nvia the web and so\nI need to add another rule.\n\n459\n00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.012\nIt's going to be web server, right?\n\n460\n00:22:48.012 --> 00:22:54.090\nSo I'm going to come in here and\nadd http traffic on port 80 from anywhere,\n\n461\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:58.570\nthis is a firewall, I'm dictating what\ntraffic is going to be allowed to get to\n\n462\n00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:03.630\nthis machine, but its fairly limited\nhere its just giving me these inbound\n\n463\n00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:08.100\nrules I'm just going to name that firewall\nand we'll review and launch it and\n\n464\n00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.220\nI'll go ahead and launch that and\nI'll tie my certificates to it and\n\n465\n00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.360\nthere we go so now its going to get\nlaunched and it's up and running.\n\n466\n00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.390\nNow, that instance has its own firewall,\nand\n\n467\n00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:24.050\nI can manage that if I go over\nhere into my security groups.\n\n468\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:27.960\nI'll find a security group that's called\nitprotv-web01, that's what I named it.\n\n469\n00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:33.070\nAnd when I click on it, not only do I\nsee inbound, but I also have outbound.\n\n470\n00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.670\nSo now I've got full firewall\nfunctionality right here, where I can go\n\n471\n00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.170\nin and I can edit what protocols are\nallowed to get to it, and what protocols\n\n472\n00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.460\nit's allowed to talk with and that's\ndone independent of the VM behind it.\n\n473\n00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.480\nThis could be a Windows machine,\na Linux machine, whatever.\n\n474\n00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.230\nThis firewall's a part of\nAmazon's infrastructure.\n\n475\n00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.770\nEven on the VPCs, I talked about\nthe virtual private cloud earlier.\n\n476\n00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.320\nVirtual private clouds have\na security group also.\n\n477\n00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.920\nSo I can have a firewall on the network\nitself and then a firewall in\n\n478\n00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.170\nbetween the network and the VM, and then a\nsoftware firewall in the VM, if you really\n\n479\n00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:06.330\nwant to go crazy and just pull your hair\nout any time you have to troubleshoot.\n\n480\n00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.016\nBut there's multiple tiers, right?\n\n481\n00:24:08.016 --> 00:24:10.840\nDefense in depth,\nwe're securing at multiple levels.\n\n482\n00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.438\nFirewalls are really useful for that.\n\n483\n00:24:13.438 --> 00:24:15.703\nThe other thing I mentioned, though,\nwas a little bit of harder and\n\n484\n00:24:15.703 --> 00:24:17.380\nthat's intrusion detection.\n\n485\n00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.680\nA lot of people who started implementing\nintrusion detection systems, IDS and\n\n486\n00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.180\nIPS, all right.\n\n487\n00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.350\nSo let's talk briefly about those.\n\n488\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:29.015\nIf you have a private cloud, if you've\ngot servers that are deploying your own\n\n489\n00:24:29.015 --> 00:24:32.100\ninfrastructure, IPS and\nIDS is a great technology.\n\n490\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.960\nAnd the way it works is like this.\n\n491\n00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.080\nYou take a network, right?\n\n492\n00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.840\nBasically the same network\nthat we have here.\n\n493\n00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:43.220\nI've got a firewall, a LAN behind it, and\na DMZ behind it, and I add some devices.\n\n494\n00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.130\nI add these devices right here,\nin between the firewall and\n\n495\n00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:48.260\nthe network that it's protecting.\n\n496\n00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.690\nAnd what that device does is,\nit takes traffic in one port and sends it\n\n497\n00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:56.260\nout the other port, and while it's in\nthe device it inspects the traffic.\n\n498\n00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.900\nIt looks at it, and\nit looks for known attacks.\n\n499\n00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.400\nIt looks for\ntraffic that's behaving irregularly.\n\n500\n00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:08.070\nIt's looking for sequence injection\nattacks or malformed URLs.\n\n501\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:12.070\nIt's looking for pings that exceed\nthe maximum ping size count.\n\n502\n00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.190\nIt's looking for\nany kind of malicious traffic.\n\n503\n00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:19.500\nAnd if it sees it, it trims it out, but\nthen good traffic it allows through.\n\n504\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.630\nIt's intrusion prevention.\n\n505\n00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.145\nIt looks for an intrusion attempt and\nit prevents it.\n\n506\n00:25:24.145 --> 00:25:26.860\nIt filters it out and\nstops it from getting through.\n\n507\n00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.970\nIPS boxes are great on\nyour own physical network.\n\n508\n00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:33.660\nThey're next to impossible to\ndeploy in AWS, or areas like that.\n\n509\n00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.740\nIn fact, Amazon has their own IPS they're\nusing that you benefit from with every\n\n510\n00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.860\nVM you create, but\nif you want to create something like this,\n\n511\n00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.760\nwhat you end up having to do is create a\nvirtual machine with an IPS running on it\n\n512\n00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.000\nand flow the traffic\nthrough the VM in AWBS.\n\n513\n00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.140\nSo, you have to control that yourself.\n\n514\n00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.350\nAnd if you go to the AWS marketplace,\nthere's a few of them out there.\n\n515\n00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:56.690\nWhen I spun up that instance earlier,\nI went into instances, and\n\n516\n00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.010\nI launched an instance.\n\n517\n00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:02.860\nYou can go into the AWS marketplace,\nand if you should do a search for\n\n518\n00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:07.400\nIPS, there's the Sophos threat manager,\nwhich is a really good one.\n\n519\n00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.050\nF5's BIG-IP, they're probably the most\nwell-known one that's out there.\n\n520\n00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.070\nSome of these other ones,\nTrend Micro I'm kind of a fan of.\n\n521\n00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.550\nBut there's several other ones.\n\n522\n00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.660\nFortinet, paloalto, they've all got them.\n\n523\n00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.820\nAnd you can deploy these as a Firewall/IPS\nin your virtual environment.\n\n524\n00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.780\nSo it's a virtual firewall, a virtual IPS.\n\n525\n00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.780\nBut do remember the one problem with IPSs.\n\n526\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.680\nThe one problem with IPSs is performance.\n\n527\n00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:35.380\nWhen your traffic is passing into\nthat IPS, it gets inspected and\n\n528\n00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.300\ncomes out, and that slows it down.\n\n529\n00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.220\nSo, if you're doing things like voice\nover IP, that creates line jitter,\n\n530\n00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.050\nit creates a poor call quality, right?\n\n531\n00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:48.580\nThere may be times where you have\ntraffic where speed is of the essence,\n\n532\n00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.020\nand an IPS defeats that.\n\n533\n00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:52.550\nThere's another way that\nwe can deploy these.\n\n534\n00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.720\nIt's actually the same technology,\nso same hardware or\n\n535\n00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.700\nsoftware that you use for an IPS.\n\n536\n00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.370\nIf you deploy is out of band, like this,\n\n537\n00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:04.770\nit becomes an IDS,\nan intrusion detection system.\n\n538\n00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.500\nWhat you do is,\nas the traffic enters your network\n\n539\n00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.780\nyou set your switch up to do\nwhat's called port mirroring.\n\n540\n00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.950\nSo any traffic I'm going\nsend to this server,\n\n541\n00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.330\nsend a copy of it to this guy over here,\nand now it can be inspected.\n\n542\n00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.310\nAnd it's inspected out of band.\n\n543\n00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:22.530\nSo this traffic makes it to the server\nin real time, nice and fast.\n\n544\n00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.380\nBut a copy is sent over here, and\n\n545\n00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.270\nif there's a intrusion we'll see it,\nthe negative.\n\n546\n00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.590\nWe can't do anything about it.\n\n547\n00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.280\nThe intrusion has already made it to\nthe server, it's already passed us.\n\n548\n00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.210\nBut at least we see it and\nwe know it happened.\n\n549\n00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.280\nSo IDS is not as effective, but\n\n550\n00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.620\nit's really useful when\nperformance is of a concern.\n\n551\n00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.785\nAnd where I normally use these\nis voice over IP networks,\n\n552\n00:27:41.785 --> 00:27:45.740\nwhere that's a big issue,\nand storage networks.\n\n553\n00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.000\nA lot of people forget to\nsecure their storage network.\n\n554\n00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.614\nYou might have a IP based fiber channel\nscan, or iscuzzie, or whatever, or\n\n555\n00:27:52.614 --> 00:27:55.070\na dedicated network for that.\n\n556\n00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:57.990\nJust because it's only used for storage\ndoesn't mean attacks can't happen there.\n\n557\n00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.500\nBut you don't want to do an IPS because\nit will slow down your storage calls and\n\n558\n00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.860\nthat's really bad.\n\n559\n00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.300\nSo we can deploy an IDS, and that way we\nare at least aware the attack occurred,\n\n560\n00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.760\nversus an attack occurring now and\nwe don't even know it.\n\n561\n00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.105\nSo, we can certainly use that.\n\n562\n00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:12.175\n>> So those intrusion detection systems,\nbecause any time you have,\n\n563\n00:28:12.175 --> 00:28:15.775\nmore in context,\nlike a public facing voice over IP system,\n\n564\n00:28:15.775 --> 00:28:18.565\nyou're constantly facing\nthose SIP attacks, right?\n\n565\n00:28:18.565 --> 00:28:22.035\nAnd where we need real time delivery,\nbut we're also facing attacks,\n\n566\n00:28:22.035 --> 00:28:25.015\nwe certainly don't need to go in\nthrough the prevention system.\n\n567\n00:28:25.015 --> 00:28:27.895\nSo we get down with the computational\npower that it takes to inspect that\n\n568\n00:28:27.895 --> 00:28:28.425\ninformation.\n\n569\n00:28:28.425 --> 00:28:31.545\nAnd one of the great things, too,\nabout the intrusion prevention systems is\n\n570\n00:28:31.545 --> 00:28:35.560\nfirewalls is, what happens if an attack\nlooks like legitimate traffic?\n\n571\n00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.470\nWell a firewall has to have a certain\ntype of traffic rules set in\n\n572\n00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.550\nplace to either allow or block it.\n\n573\n00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.890\nWell, you know hackers are crafty.\n\n574\n00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.290\nThey're very intelligent.\n\n575\n00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.700\nWhat happens if you have some\nkind of traffic, for instance,\n\n576\n00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.220\nlike a sequel attack?\n\n577\n00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.350\nIt's legitimate traffic, so\nthe firewall might let that go through,\n\n578\n00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.610\nwhere the intrusion prevention system\nmight actually pick up on that.\n\n579\n00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:59.800\nAgain, the difference between active\nsecurity and passive security,\n\n580\n00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.140\nthe IDS is going to monitor.\n\n581\n00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.500\nIt's going to send out an alert, but\n\n582\n00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.360\nit's not going to do anything in\nreal time to help us protect that.\n\n583\n00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.960\n>> Yeah.\nI know we're low on time, Wes, but\n\n584\n00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.500\nthere's two things that I want to\nmention before we wrap this one up.\n\n585\n00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.470\nI want to mention DMZs.\n\n586\n00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:17.970\nIt's a good idea that, if you have public\nfacing servers and internal only servers,\n\n587\n00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.030\nthat you separate them out.\n\n588\n00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.490\nAnd that's what I've done in\nall of my diagrams you've seen,\n\n589\n00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.755\nwhere I have a local area network and\na DMZ.\n\n590\n00:29:23.755 --> 00:29:28.070\nBu,t when I created that\nAmazon VPC earlier,\n\n591\n00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.200\nI made a part of it public and\nthe rest of it private.\n\n592\n00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.810\nThat's not a DMZ, because if somebody\nbreaks into one of those public servers,\n\n593\n00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.530\nthey have access to all\nthe private ones that are in it.\n\n594\n00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.150\nThey're all in the same VPC.\n\n595\n00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.118\nSo even in a cloud,\nyou'll want to create more than one VPC.\n\n596\n00:29:41.118 --> 00:29:45.210\nYou'll want to have some VPCs that\nare public, and some that are private, and\n\n597\n00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.630\nyou can set up communication between them.\n\n598\n00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:51.190\nUsing Amazon as an example, they have the\nfirewall that sits in between the VPCs,\n\n599\n00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.070\nand you can dictate what traffic's\nallowed and what traffic isn't.\n\n600\n00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.880\nBut a DMZ, a demilitarized zone,\nthat's where you have that\n\n601\n00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.930\nisolated group of servers that don't have\naccess to your private systems and do have\n\n602\n00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.920\naccess to the internet, so the internet\npeople can connect to them and view them.\n\n603\n00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.570\nThey have really strict controls there.\n\n604\n00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:08.070\nYou've got to keep an eye on those.\n\n605\n00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.790\n>> Very good.\nSo a lot of good information.\n\n606\n00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:14.600\nBut Don, I know that you do have one\nother thing that you have to mention, and\n\n607\n00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.530\nthat's audit logs.\n\n608\n00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.180\n>> Audit logs.\n\n609\n00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.510\n>> All of this stuff is great.\n\n610\n00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.480\nIt's great when you can stop an attack,\nbut\n\n611\n00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.080\nthere's going to be a time sooner or\nlater where you don't stop the attack,\n\n612\n00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.520\nwhere the attack does\nmake it to your server.\n\n613\n00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.280\nAnd when that happens,\n\n614\n00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.170\nyou're going to rely on your audit\nlogs to find out what happened.\n\n615\n00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:29.860\nYour virtualization platforms like,\n\n616\n00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.630\nVM ware, a lot of times they\ncan report back audit logs.\n\n617\n00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.870\nIf you're running HyperV,\nyou've got your Windows logs.\n\n618\n00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.740\nLet me just show you real quick.\n\n619\n00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:41.460\nLike here in this Windows system, if I\njump into my Event Viewer here in Windows.\n\n620\n00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.020\nI'm just going to jump into\nthat Event Viewer real quick.\n\n621\n00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.500\nInside of the Event Viewer,\nyou've got your Windows logs, and\n\n622\n00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.350\nright inside of there,\nyou've got your security logs.\n\n623\n00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.010\nThose are security audit logs.\n\n624\n00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.330\nAnd these can be set to\ntrack all sorts of things.\n\n625\n00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.820\nBy default, they track log on,\nlog off, and special permission usage.\n\n626\n00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:01.660\nWe can see what was going on in our\nserver at a particular time and\n\n627\n00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.360\nwhat kind of activity was going on.\n\n628\n00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.510\nThat's really useful when\nyou're troubleshooting and\n\n629\n00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.600\ntrying to track down events.\n\n630\n00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.430\nYou need to have your audit logs set up,\nand\n\n631\n00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.880\nyou need to be reviewing them to look for\nexceptions that are in there.\n\n632\n00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.550\nSo even with our other virtualization\nplatforms where you don't see\n\n633\n00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.130\nthe operating system, in Windows\nyou see the OS, very visible, but\n\n634\n00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:21.670\nin VM Ware ESX for example,\nyou never log in to the host.\n\n635\n00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.450\nYou're always in V center or wherever.\n\n636\n00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.410\nWe still have audit logs there\nthat we've got to monitor.\n\n637\n00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.030\nLet me just show you real quick.\n\n638\n00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:31.670\nSo here I am in V Sphere, and\nin my vCenter client, you've got all\n\n639\n00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:35.450\nthe different things you can configure,\nbut you've got a log browser right there.\n\n640\n00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:39.200\nAnd you can jump into your logs, and\nyou can start to monitor that activity.\n\n641\n00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:43.640\nAnd, you may have a lot of stuff that's\ngoing on on a particular instance or\n\n642\n00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.350\na particular host that you can see.\n\n643\n00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:46.720\nAnd I didn't show it earlier.\n\n644\n00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.780\nWe talked about firewalls.\n\n645\n00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.710\nVMware has a firewall built into\ntheir system that runs independent of\n\n646\n00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.095\nthe operating system under the hood.\n\n647\n00:31:53.095 --> 00:31:55.580\nFor example, if I go to host and\nclusters, and\n\n648\n00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.580\nlet me just pick a host here at random.\n\n649\n00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.740\nI'll take like my,\nI'll pick a host at random.\n\n650\n00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.032\nI only have one, so it's not too random.\n\n651\n00:32:03.032 --> 00:32:06.588\n[LAUGH] But when I pick one of these\nhosts, like this ES Xbox itself,\n\n652\n00:32:06.588 --> 00:32:11.030\nI can go up here to, Manage, and Settings,\nand see if I can remember where this is,\n\n653\n00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.830\nSecurity profile, there we go.\n\n654\n00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.990\nAnd we start looking at the security\nprofile, and this going to look familiar.\n\n655\n00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.445\nIt's a lot like what we had with AWS.\n\n656\n00:32:18.445 --> 00:32:19.761\nYou can come in here and\n\n657\n00:32:19.761 --> 00:32:24.570\nspecify what incoming connections\nare allowed to get to the host itself.\n\n658\n00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.700\nBecause if an attacker can break into VM,\nthat's one thing.\n\n659\n00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.580\nBut if they can break in to the host\nthat's where they can really\n\n660\n00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.500\ndo some damage.\n\n661\n00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.920\nAnd here's where it's\napproving all of that traffic.\n\n662\n00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.210\nThere's a lot to pass in and out of\nthis system from management purposes and\n\n663\n00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.820\nother things You'll see SSH right here.\n\n664\n00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.550\nSSH connectivity is allowed\nfrom everywhere all.\n\n665\n00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.310\nAnd so I could edit this and\nstart to change those rules and\n\n666\n00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:50.670\nrestrict who's able to manage this system\nand really protect that and secure it.\n\n667\n00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:54.950\nAnd then my audit logs what were tracking\nover in that logging screen that I was at\n\n668\n00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.430\njust a moment ago,\nthat's where we'll be able to see.\n\n669\n00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:02.670\nAny kind of security incidents or\nother activities that are going on, I\n\n670\n00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.600\nwould need to, you know, select an object,\nand all that good stuff, to find out.\n\n671\n00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.510\nAnd so I'll just pick plabesx01 and\nsay OK.\n\n672\n00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:12.115\nAnd now we're gonna start getting\nthe logging information Information, and\n\n673\n00:33:12.115 --> 00:33:15.445\napparently I've got to retrieve my logs.\n\n674\n00:33:15.445 --> 00:33:18.015\nWhen you have V Center it periodically\nreaches out to the servers and\n\n675\n00:33:18.015 --> 00:33:20.595\nharvests the logs, and so\napparently mine hasn't done that so\n\n676\n00:33:20.595 --> 00:33:21.335\nit's gonna reach out and do it.\n\n677\n00:33:21.335 --> 00:33:22.695\nI don't know how long that's gonna take,\n\n678\n00:33:22.695 --> 00:33:24.525\ndepends on how long\nthe server's been running.\n\n679\n00:33:24.525 --> 00:33:26.605\nBut, it's gonna gather that data and\nwe can start to monitor it.\n\n680\n00:33:26.605 --> 00:33:29.820\nSo remember, you gotta watch\nyour logs in your guest OS.\n\n681\n00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:33.360\nYou've gotta watch the logs in your\nvirtualization platform and if it's in\n\n682\n00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:37.450\nthe third party cloud like Amazon,\nyou gotta monitor your logs there too.\n\n683\n00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:41.100\nAudit logs are really important to keep\ntract of who's performed, what actions.\n\n684\n00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:45.470\nStarting up and shutting down BMS,\nspinning up new BMS to leading BMS,\n\n685\n00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:49.120\nlogging into the virtual machines in\nthe activities that take inside are all\n\n686\n00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.090\nimportant parts of maintaining\nsecurity in your network.\n\n687\n00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.710\n>> Great information Don as always and\nwe thank you guys for joining us.\n\n688\n00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:56.880\nKeep in mind in this episode,\n\n689\n00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.850\nwe've talked about some of the security\nconcepts to keep that information secure.\n\n690\n00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.710\nAnd also to make sure that the information\nthat's flowing into your network and\n\n691\n00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.810\nout of your network stay secure too.\n\n692\n00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:07.740\nBecause data security, very important.\n\n693\n00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.580\nAnd especially when you're\ngoing over private networks.\n\n694\n00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.380\nKeep in mind, we've talked about\nthe virtual private network.\n\n695\n00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.150\nIt's definitely a good\nconcept to understand.\n\n696\n00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.630\nYou're gonna need to know it for the exam.\n\n697\n00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:18.410\nWe've talked about firewalls as well.\n\n698\n00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:21.950\nThe difference between the software based\nfirewall and the hardware based firewall.\n\n699\n00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:25.050\nWe've also talked about, well,\nhere comes acronym city, right?\n\n700\n00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:25.750\nIDS, IPS.\n\n701\n00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:27.260\nRemember, passive detection,\n\n702\n00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.060\nversus something that can implement\ncounter measures, the IPS, right?\n\n703\n00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.870\nWe've talked about demilitarized zones,\nDMZ's If you come across other terminology\n\n704\n00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:39.810\nlike perimeter network, screen subnets,\nknow that that's all the same thing and\n\n705\n00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.100\nthat we've also talked\nabout audit logs as well.\n\n706\n00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.800\nDon, you've got anything else for\nus today?\n\n707\n00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.630\n>> Well I think that's quite\na fire hose of information.\n\n708\n00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.530\nI've got a tonne more\nto talk about security.\n\n709\n00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:49.810\nWe're gonna do some more parts to this,\n\n710\n00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.380\na couple other concepts we\nneed to be aware of, but\n\n711\n00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.120\njust remember all the security practices\nyou have in your local environment,\n\n712\n00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.350\napply to your cloud environment also,\nyou've got to be vigilant.\n\n713\n00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:01.630\n>> All right, well stick around because\nwe have got a lot more security concepts\n\n714\n00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:05.460\ncoming your way but we're going to\ngo ahead and end this episode now so\n\n715\n00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.920\nI've been your host here\nat ITProTV Wes Brian.\n\n716\n00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.890\n>> And I'm Don.\n\n717\n00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:11.029\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n718\n00:35:11.029 --> 00:35:19.050\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.187\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:18.187 --> 00:00:20.610\nwe're gonna be moving along In Cloud Plus.\n\n5\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.827\nAnd we're gonna be looking at a part\ntwo of security concepts, and\n\n6\n00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:27.120\nwe have mister Don Pizet on hand to\nhelp us out with these concepts.\n\n7\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.190\nDon, how are you doing sir?\n\n8\n00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.360\n>> I am doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.440\nIn the last episode, I had I had\nabout four pages of notes sitting\n\n10\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.270\nbeside me of topics I wanted to cover.\n\n11\n00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.210\nWe got maybe halfway\nthrough the first page, so\n\n12\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.360\nI really just had a lot\nmore to talk about.\n\n13\n00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.210\nSo we're doing a part two on this,\nand gonna be able to jump in and\n\n14\n00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.230\ncover some of those other topics.\n\n15\n00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.440\nWe'll have to film some more episodes,\ntoo.\n\n16\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.710\n>> I like what the pre-show\nconversation was.\n\n17\n00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.660\nVPNs, that takes about 15 minutes.\n\n18\n00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.935\nFour hours later.\n\n19\n00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:50.738\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:52.260\n[LAUGH] All right, so\n\n21\n00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.610\nwe do definitely have some other\ntopics we need to be familiar with.\n\n22\n00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.330\nCompTIA wants to make sure\nyou understand the security\n\n23\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.950\nimplications of being in the cloud,\nand we want to cover those right here.\n\n24\n00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.150\nSo the first thing I wanna talk about are\nthe types of attacks that are out there.\n\n25\n00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.957\nEspecially distributed denial\nservice attacks, DDOS.\n\n26\n00:01:09.957 --> 00:01:13.950\nCompTIA calls it out on the objectives\nyou can't go a day in the tech\n\n27\n00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.490\nnews world without hearing about\nDDOS being administered to somebody.\n\n28\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.640\nThey're very, very common.\n\n29\n00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.810\nAnd so for most people this is the key\nattack you're gonna watch out for.\n\n30\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.980\nThere's always the risk that somebody\ncould have a very specialized attack that\n\n31\n00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.550\nallows them to compromise one of\nyour servers and get at your data.\n\n32\n00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.300\nBut it's extremely easy to perform\na denial of service attack.\n\n33\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.460\nSo let's talk about that.\n\n34\n00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.920\nNow what is denial of service?\n\n35\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.890\nYou have a service.\n\n36\n00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.720\nLet's say Our website, ITProTV.\n\n37\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.830\nWe got a website, and\nyou can come to our website and\n\n38\n00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.950\nyou can watch our videos and\nit works great.\n\n39\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.475\nBut we have bandwidth.\n\n40\n00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:49.080\nWe have bandwidth that we pay for every\nmonth, and we have a certain amount of it.\n\n41\n00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.700\nAnd if we ever hit the limit of that\nbandwidth, our site stops responding.\n\n42\n00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.860\nPeople can't get to our site.\n\n43\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.630\nOur service is no longer available.\n\n44\n00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.540\nNow, we monitor how much bandwidth we use\nevery month and we pay the right amount to\n\n45\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.420\npay for that, and so we've always\ngot the right amount of bandwidth.\n\n46\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.100\nBut if an attacker wanted,\nthey could start flooding our lines,\n\n47\n00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.530\nflooding our bandwidth, saturating all\nthat bandwidth, and then we run out,\n\n48\n00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.810\nand then our legitimate customers are no\nlonger able to get to the website.\n\n49\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.150\nThat's a very real thing, it happens,\nand it's incredibly easy to do.\n\n50\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.720\nIt used to be super\neasy back in the 1990s,\n\n51\n00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.640\ncuz people didn't have a lot of bandwidth.\n\n52\n00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.570\nIt's actually a little bit harder\nnow because people have large\n\n53\n00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.790\nquantities of bandwidth.\n\n54\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.340\nHere at the studio we got\n80 megabits of bandwidth.\n\n55\n00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.500\nSo if somebody wants to perform\na denial service against our system\n\n56\n00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.680\nthey have to send 80 megabits of traffic.\n\n57\n00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.560\nWell let's say I'm sitting at home and\nI'm on my computer.\n\n58\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.300\nI'm like I hate those ITProTV guys,\nthat Dons voice really\n\n59\n00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.580\nannoys the heck out of me I'm gonna flood\ntheir line, and shut them down, okay?\n\n60\n00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.170\nSitting from my computer at home, I have\na cable modem, high speed, broadband,\n\n61\n00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.250\nwhatever, it's all bs.\n\n62\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.290\nSo, I have 20 megabytes, is,\nmaybe, what I get on a good day.\n\n63\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.410\nSo, I can generate 20 megabits of traffic,\nand throw it at ITProTV, but,\n\n64\n00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.880\nwe've got 80 megabits of bandwidth here,\nI can't saturate the line, right?\n\n65\n00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.330\nDoing a straight up denial of service\nstack is not really possible.\n\n66\n00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.460\nThere's some protocols\nthat can be exploited,\n\n67\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.370\nand it's not always about bandwidth.\n\n68\n00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.580\nIt might be about throughput,\nthat if I send enough packets,\n\n69\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.260\nlike TCP buffer saturation.\n\n70\n00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.610\nIf I open up enough TCP sessions\nI might not be flowing in a true\n\n71\n00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.750\npayload across it.\n\n72\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.855\nSo very small packages\nopening up TCP sessions.\n\n73\n00:03:26.855 --> 00:03:31.000\nWell, a server can only have so many TCP\nports open before it runs out of RAM and\n\n74\n00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.320\nso we can flood that opening up by just\ndoing a bunch of TCP send requests and\n\n75\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.550\nthe server will open up all these\nports waiting for acknowledgements and\n\n76\n00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.400\nthey'll just sit there open and we can\nrun the server out of resources, right?\n\n77\n00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.930\nSo we can do that even with low bandwidth,\nbut it's easy to spot that.\n\n78\n00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.810\nIt's easy to see why does this one person\nhave 10 million TCP SYNs open right now?\n\n79\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.850\nWhat the heck's going on there, right?\n\n80\n00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.590\nAnd you can spot it and\nstop it and modern firewalls do,\n\n81\n00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.370\nthey see that traffic and stop it.\n\n82\n00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.630\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n83\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.020\nSame thing with a giant flood of\ntraffic coming from one system.\n\n84\n00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.340\nSo what attackers have to do is they have\nto get a little more sophisticated, and\n\n85\n00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.400\nthat's where the old denial of\nservice that no longer works\n\n86\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.590\ngets replaced by the distributed\ndenial of service.\n\n87\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.835\nSo let's talk a little bit about how\ndistributed denial service works.\n\n88\n00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:17.335\nAnd understand why it's so difficult for\nus to protect from that, all right?\n\n89\n00:04:17.335 --> 00:04:19.575\nWell I've got a diagram\nkinda whipped up here but\n\n90\n00:04:19.575 --> 00:04:20.945\nwith typical corporate network, right?\n\n91\n00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:23.945\nYou've got the Internet and you might\nhave the DMZ with some servers and\n\n92\n00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:25.205\nthat what's normally gonna get attacked.\n\n93\n00:04:25.205 --> 00:04:26.935\nThat's your public facing side.\n\n94\n00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:27.675\nYou got a website.\n\n95\n00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:30.805\nIf somebody wants to bring it down,\nthey're gonna start sending a flood of\n\n96\n00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:34.070\ntraffic in to hit that web server or\nwhatever, right?\n\n97\n00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.750\nWhen they do that, if they can exceed your\nbandwidth that's one way to shut you down,\n\n98\n00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.310\nor if they can exceed the amount of\nconnections allow that can shut you down,\n\n99\n00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.230\nthere's several different\nways they can go about it.\n\n100\n00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.240\nThat's what they're attacking, all right?\n\n101\n00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.020\nBut I just said like one host is\nnot enough, and it really isn't.\n\n102\n00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.830\nSo today if you wanna do a denial\nof service attack on somebody,\n\n103\n00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.910\nyou don't need one host.\n\n104\n00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.560\nYou don't need ten.\n\n105\n00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.520\nYou don't need a hundred.\n\n106\n00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.690\nYou need thousands, tens of thousands or\n\n107\n00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.540\neven hundreds of thousands of\nhosts to perform that attack.\n\n108\n00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.850\nWell, who has that?\n\n109\n00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.570\nWho has a hundred thousand machines\nsitting there ready to do an attack?\n\n110\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.380\nThe answer is nobody.\n\n111\n00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.320\nNobody's got that many machines\nsitting around just for an attack.\n\n112\n00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.600\nSo, what an attacker has to do\nis compromise other systems.\n\n113\n00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.410\nA distributed denial of service\nattack involves multiple pieces.\n\n114\n00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.490\nThere's you, you and your servers,\nright, that's what's being targeted,\n\n115\n00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.300\nthat's what they're after.\n\n116\n00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.330\nThen there's the attacker, and\nthe attacker might be just one\n\n117\n00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.340\nlittle laptop sitting in\na coffee shop in Czechoslovakia.\n\n118\n00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.960\nHe could be anywhere, right,\nhe could be right in the same city as you.\n\n119\n00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.780\nThey're just sitting there\nin a coffee shop, right.\n\n120\n00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.750\nAnd they want to attack you.\n\n121\n00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.010\nSo what do they do?\n\n122\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.990\nWell first they write some kind of virus,\n\n123\n00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.660\nsome kind of malware, a worm,\nthat spreads across the Internet.\n\n124\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.730\nAnd as it's spread across the Internet\nit's infecting machines, right.\n\n125\n00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:50.510\nThese machines,\n\n126\n00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.560\nwhich are gonna be our infected systems,\nthey're sometimes called bots, or zombies.\n\n127\n00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.870\nThese are machines that are just regular\nold people that are out there that don't\n\n128\n00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.020\nknow how to run decent antivirus, right?\n\n129\n00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.530\nAnd it's your mom and dad,\nit's your aunt and uncle,\n\n130\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.560\nit's your coworkers at the office,\nit's people who are not IT people that\n\n131\n00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.010\nare just browsing the Internet and\nthey get their system infected.\n\n132\n00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.740\nAnd when that happens, they start\nphoning home, not to the attacker.\n\n133\n00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.400\nBecause, if they were\nphoning home to the attacker,\n\n134\n00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.930\nthe authorities could find that and\nshut them off real fast.\n\n135\n00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.320\nBut instead, they're reporting back\nto what are called Command and\n\n136\n00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.850\nControl Servers, C&C Servers, right?\n\n137\n00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.585\nThese servers are normally running\nsomething like in net relay chat, so\n\n138\n00:06:30.585 --> 00:06:32.010\nrunning little chat rooms.\n\n139\n00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.010\nAnd the server, these infected\nsystems reach back to the servers, and\n\n140\n00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.510\nthey listen for commands.\n\n141\n00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.920\nAnd all the attacker has to do is send\na command to one of those C&C servers.\n\n142\n00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.010\nIt'll be a chat room.\n\n143\n00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.860\nSo they send a message in the chat room\nthat says, target this IP address.\n\n144\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.340\nAnd then all of the infected systems.\n\n145\n00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.850\nAnd there might be hundreds\nof thousands of these things.\n\n146\n00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.430\nThese infected systems\nall around the world,\n\n147\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.470\nthey all start sending very small\namounts of traffic at your server.\n\n148\n00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.938\nThey're checking in with the C&C boxes,\nthey get their instructions, and\n\n149\n00:07:03.938 --> 00:07:05.167\nthen they start to attack.\n\n150\n00:07:05.167 --> 00:07:08.620\nAnd the way the attack works\nis it looks like this.\n\n151\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.760\nThe attacker sends\ninstructions to the C&C.\n\n152\n00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.720\nThe infected systems all get\nthe instructions from the C&C servers.\n\n153\n00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.990\nAnd there might be more than one\nC&C server or it might only be one.\n\n154\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.760\nBut they start to get their\ninstructions and then they all,\n\n155\n00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.380\nat a predetermined time, simultaneously\nstart sending traffic at your system.\n\n156\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.090\nAnd now you're getting what\nlooks like legitimate traffic.\n\n157\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.520\nThese guys, they might not be malformed\nTCP SYNs or anything like that.\n\n158\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.950\nIt might just be they asked for\na copy of your home page,\n\n159\n00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.970\njust like anybody on the Internet\nbrowsing your home page would do.\n\n160\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.090\nSo, can we recognize that\nas malicious traffic?\n\n161\n00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.130\nNo, it's really hard to identify this,\n\n162\n00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.180\ncuz what we're getting is\nhundreds of thousands of\n\n163\n00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.030\nconnections every single second from\npeople just asking to get our homepage.\n\n164\n00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.758\nAnd it exceeds the resources of our\nservers and our servers go offline.\n\n165\n00:07:55.758 --> 00:07:59.086\nServers are up and running, they just\ndon't have the bandwidth or the CPU or\n\n166\n00:07:59.086 --> 00:08:00.751\nthe RAM to be able to handle that load.\n\n167\n00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:01.447\nRight?\n\n168\n00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:03.049\nThat's a distributed\ndenial of service attack.\n\n169\n00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:06.610\nIt's very difficult to\nprevent this type of attack.\n\n170\n00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.230\n>> Now Don one of the things\nthat this looks like, and\n\n171\n00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.980\ncorrect me if I'm wrong here.\n\n172\n00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.620\nThis looks like,\nwhat would be known as a reflected attack.\n\n173\n00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.320\nWhere it's being bounced\noff a third party.\n\n174\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.840\nIt's not actually coming\nfrom the attacker,\n\n175\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.660\nlike you said, you mentioned yourself.\n\n176\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.960\nSo, is this kind of like\na reflected attack,\n\n177\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.080\nthe fact that it's being reflected\noff of that Internet relay chatroom?\n\n178\n00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.490\n>> Well, it's not a true reflection.\n\n179\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:28.440\n>> It's not a true reflection.\n\n180\n00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.290\n>> Right, so a true reflection is where\nI send the attack traffic, right.\n\n181\n00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.980\nSo, malformed sim requests.\n\n182\n00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.070\nAnd I bounce those through a proxy, so\n\n183\n00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.150\nit looks like the attack's\ncoming from that proxy.\n\n184\n00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.820\nWell here, whoever the attacker is,\n\n185\n00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.120\nisn't necessarily sending\nan attack at all, right.\n\n186\n00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.620\nThey're just sending\na command to the CNC and\n\n187\n00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.600\nthat command is normally saying\ntarget this IP and that's it.\n\n188\n00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.950\nIt's not an attack.\n\n189\n00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.070\nAnd the cnc servers aren't\ngiving an attack either.\n\n190\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.080\nIt's the malware that's installed\nin these infected machines.\n\n191\n00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.480\nThat's what's generating the attack,\nso it's not a true reflection.\n\n192\n00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.500\nThe attack is originating from the\ninfected hosts and that's a key principle.\n\n193\n00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.900\nBecause, if the attack actually\noriginated from the attacker's laptop.\n\n194\n00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.130\nThe instant they shut their laptop\noff the attack would stop, right.\n\n195\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.100\nBut with a DDOS, once they start that\nattack, they can shut their laptop off.\n\n196\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.180\nThey can turn the CNC servers off.\n\n197\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.170\nAnd the infected machines will\ncontinue to attack the target,\n\n198\n00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.620\nuntil they're told to stop.\n\n199\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.750\nAnd if the CNC boxes go off,\nthey never get told to stop.\n\n200\n00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.900\nAnd they'll continue to attack,\nuntil somebody removes the malware, right.\n\n201\n00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.570\nAnd so, that's why when the FBI or\norganizations like that,\n\n202\n00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.750\nwhen they seize these CNC boxes.\n\n203\n00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.980\nOne of the first things they have to do,\nis send out a stop command.\n\n204\n00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.600\nAnd tell people,\nhey stop attacking the servers, and\n\n205\n00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.130\nthen they have to let that\nstop command sit there.\n\n206\n00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.710\nBecause the infected machines\nare just checking in every so often.\n\n207\n00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.060\nSome of them only check\nin once every 24 hours.\n\n208\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.280\nAnd so, it can take an entire day\nbefore they're able to stop the attack.\n\n209\n00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.460\n>> So,\nvery good anti-virus software essentially,\n\n210\n00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.030\nwill stop the spread of the zombie.\n\n211\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.070\nSo, basically good anti-virus software\nwill stop a zombie apocalypse.\n\n212\n00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.400\n>> Yeah, yeah,\nbasically it's just like walking dead.\n\n213\n00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.230\nThe problem here,\nhere's the challenge, right.\n\n214\n00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.470\nSo you, as the IT administrator,\nwhere do you fit in this mix?\n\n215\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.780\nWhen I look at this topology,\n\n216\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.850\nall these systems that are involved,\nI fit in over here.\n\n217\n00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.290\nOkay, so can I go out to the world and\ninstall good antivirus and\n\n218\n00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.040\npractices on everybody's\ncomputer in the entire planet?\n\n219\n00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.280\nNo, it's not a realistic goal.\n\n220\n00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.300\nI don't have control of these systems,\nthe infected systems.\n\n221\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.130\nAnd that's where the weakness is,\nand we have no control.\n\n222\n00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.340\nSo what can we do about it?\n\n223\n00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.340\nWell, you can detect\nthe denial of service attack.\n\n224\n00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.270\nSo, if I go back to my standard topology.\n\n225\n00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:34.370\nWe could have our firewall set, to look\nfor excess traffic and trim it off, right.\n\n226\n00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.990\nThen if I see a bunch of traffic coming\nfrom one host, I can just filter that off.\n\n227\n00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.480\nAnd now it doesn't happen, right.\n\n228\n00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.960\nBut that doesn't necessarily solve my\nproblem, because this is my WAN link.\n\n229\n00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.090\nAnd the bandwidth is\nalready getting saturated.\n\n230\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.880\nThe firewall might trim it off, so\nmy server's responsive on the back end.\n\n231\n00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.700\nbut on the front end it's dead.\n\n232\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.480\nSo, it actually has to be\nstopped before it gets to us.\n\n233\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.020\nIt has to be stopped here.\n\n234\n00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.630\nAnd that means you're going\nto have to go to your ISP.\n\n235\n00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.316\nYou're going to have to go to your\nservice provider and say hey,\n\n236\n00:10:59.316 --> 00:11:01.616\ncan you stop that denial service attack?\n\n237\n00:11:01.616 --> 00:11:05.140\nIf you got a cloud platform,\nlike Amazon web services or\n\n238\n00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.330\nMicrosoft Azure,\nthey're doing this for you.\n\n239\n00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:08.810\nRight, or\nthey should be doing this for you.\n\n240\n00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.940\nAnd stopping that attack and\ngetting things cleaned up for you.\n\n241\n00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.310\nIf you don't have that or\n\n242\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.360\nif the cloud provider you're using\ndoesn't provide that service.\n\n243\n00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.130\nThen I usually recommend a third party.\n\n244\n00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.730\nAnd I know that's what we do with ITProTV,\nwe have a third party that provides that.\n\n245\n00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.610\nThere's companies like Cloud Flare and\nSecurie.\n\n246\n00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.940\nAnd you can use those guys where\nyour traffic goes to them first, and\n\n247\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.360\nthen comes to you.\n\n248\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.040\nAnd if they see\na denial-of-service attack,\n\n249\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.850\nthey've got way more\nbandwidth than you do.\n\n250\n00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.488\nAnd so, they can stop that attack,\n\n251\n00:11:35.488 --> 00:11:39.340\nmaybe even move your IP\naddresses to change your IPs.\n\n252\n00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.250\nAnd now the attacks are pointing\nto the wrong IPs,right.\n\n253\n00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.240\nYou can do things like that,\nto protect and insulate your system, and\n\n254\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.520\nthat's important.\n\n255\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.340\nBecause you need that, you need that for\nyour systems to stay online.\n\n256\n00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.640\nSo, it's important to understand these.\n\n257\n00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.500\nNow ,the actual attack can\ntake a few different forms,\n\n258\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.560\nCompT doesn't call it a tunnel.\n\n259\n00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.130\nIf you want to learn about all\nthe different types of attacks.\n\n260\n00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.030\nDefinitely check out\nour security plus show.\n\n261\n00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.390\nWe cover a lot of them in there.\n\n262\n00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:06.010\nBut they specifically call out a ping\nof death and a ping flood, right.\n\n263\n00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.770\nPing is a really easy protocol to exploit.\n\n264\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.000\nBecause when these attacks come in, these\ninfected systems need to send traffic.\n\n265\n00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.780\nAnd ping traffic is sessionless.\n\n266\n00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:16.960\nYou can just throw it on the network and\n\n267\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.250\nyou can throw another\none right afterwards.\n\n268\n00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.560\nSystems expect to see\na lot of ping traffic.\n\n269\n00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.800\nAnd so, you can get a ton of it coming in.\n\n270\n00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.810\nJust a raw ping flood can\neat up your bandwidth or\n\n271\n00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.570\nconsume your server resources.\n\n272\n00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.160\nBut ping floods are pretty easy to detect.\n\n273\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.320\nYou just see a ton of pings,\nso you filter them out.\n\n274\n00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.630\nBut a ping of death,\nis a little bit different.\n\n275\n00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:38.120\nA ping normally contains about,\nlet's say, 58 bytes of traffic.\n\n276\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.290\nIt can be less, it can be more.\n\n277\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.630\nBut it's usually around 58 bytes of\ntraffic, when it goes across the network.\n\n278\n00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:47.990\nA ping of death, is where you put\na lot more data into that ping.\n\n279\n00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.070\nIf you run a protocol sniffer and\nyou intercept a ping.\n\n280\n00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.860\nThe traffic that's inside of it,\nis normally just the alphabet repeated.\n\n281\n00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.540\nRight, so A, B, C,\n\n282\n00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.390\nD all the way through Z and\nthen A through Z again and A through Z.\n\n283\n00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.690\nThat's what's normally inside a ping,\nit's not much.\n\n284\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.970\nAnd, if we increase the size of that ping,\nit's just the alphabet repeating more,\n\n285\n00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.040\nand more, and more.\n\n286\n00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.860\nWell, a packet when it crosses\nthe network, can only be so big.\n\n287\n00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.591\nMost systems limit it to 1,500 bytes.\n\n288\n00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:15.920\nAnd if we build a ping and\nwe push it above that 1,500 bytes,\n\n289\n00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.908\nthen it's going to get segmented, right.\n\n290\n00:13:18.908 --> 00:13:22.140\nIt's going to get broken into fragments,\nto be able to be sent on the network.\n\n291\n00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.230\nAnd on the other end,\nthey've got to reassemble that.\n\n292\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.610\nAnd if we go even bigger, like if\nwe cross the 65,535 byte threshold.\n\n293\n00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:33.900\nIf we get over that, the side of\nthe other end is receiving these frames.\n\n294\n00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.360\nAnd they're holding them in a buffer\non the network card, a memory buffer.\n\n295\n00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.502\nAnd they're reassembling them.\n\n296\n00:13:38.502 --> 00:13:42.519\nAnd so,\nif I'm sending over 65 bytes of data.\n\n297\n00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:46.310\nAnd it's having to build,\nactually it would be 65 kilobytes of data.\n\n298\n00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.060\nIt's going to hold that\nwhile it reassembles it and\n\n299\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.750\nif I can keep sending more of these pings.\n\n300\n00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.430\nIt's holding those and re-assembling them,\nI can run the network heart out of memory.\n\n301\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.520\nAnd that's a really easy\nattack to pull off.\n\n302\n00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.910\nNow, if you've got a firewall, every\nmodern firewall checks this and stops it.\n\n303\n00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.810\nThey stop it from getting to your\nserver and the payloads not that big,\n\n304\n00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.140\nthat you're not gonna\nrun a lot of bandwidth.\n\n305\n00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.030\nAnd so, you're fine and you're insulated.\n\n306\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.540\nHaving a good firewall is essential.\n\n307\n00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.490\nBlocking pings is even better.\n\n308\n00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.675\nWhen you configure Amazon Web Services or\nMicrosoft Azure or whatever.\n\n309\n00:14:14.675 --> 00:14:15.270\nIn their firewalls,\n\n310\n00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.490\nyou can block pings and\nthen you don't have to worry about that.\n\n311\n00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.450\nBut there's other protocols\nthat can be exploited.\n\n312\n00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.449\nThere's a lot of other things\nthat can be attacked, so\n\n313\n00:14:22.449 --> 00:14:24.390\ndon't assume that just\nblocking pings is enough.\n\n314\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.164\nYou want to have a good\nfirewall in place and\n\n315\n00:14:26.164 --> 00:14:28.710\nyou want to only allow\ntraffic that's legitimate.\n\n316\n00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.570\nAnd you really need somebody\nmonitoring that connection.\n\n317\n00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.730\nIt can be a cloud provider or\na third party service.\n\n318\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.350\n>> So if somebody does have information\ninside of that storage region and\n\n319\n00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.290\nit could be executable code, right.\n\n320\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:44.090\nAnd it fills up that memory and it spills\nover into unchecked portions of memory.\n\n321\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.170\nThey could potentially execute that and\nperform some kind of action now,\n\n322\n00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:47.940\ncouldn't they?\n\n323\n00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.130\n>> Yeah and that's kind of the key\npiece of a buffer over flow.\n\n324\n00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.670\nWhen they run you out of memory.\n\n325\n00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.410\nThe extra data you send, where does it go?\n\n326\n00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.800\nHopefully it gets thrown away,\nthat's what supposed to happen.\n\n327\n00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.352\nBut sometimes, it can make it\ninto the other memory buffers and\n\n328\n00:14:58.352 --> 00:14:59.856\nnow they can remotely execute code.\n\n329\n00:14:59.856 --> 00:15:02.028\nAnd that's really the worst kind\nof compromise, right there.\n\n330\n00:15:02.028 --> 00:15:04.100\nThat's where you're\ngoing to be in trouble.\n\n331\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.980\nSo, having a good firewall, having some\nkind of monitoring, some IDS or IPS.\n\n332\n00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.390\nThey'll detect that and\nsee it and allow you to stop it.\n\n333\n00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:11.357\nDefinitely something to plan for.\n\n334\n00:15:11.357 --> 00:15:14.390\nAll right, now there's other\nthings that we can implement.\n\n335\n00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.460\nThat we need to be aware of,\nas far as security goes.\n\n336\n00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.740\nThose are just some examples of attacks\nthat CompT wanted you to be familiar with.\n\n337\n00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.790\nThe next thing I want to talk\nabout are access controls, right.\n\n338\n00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.000\nLimiting who's able to\naccess your resources.\n\n339\n00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.730\nBecause, it might be legitimate traffic,\nlike somebody SSHing in.\n\n340\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.050\nSSH is not bad by itself,\nif it's an approved employee.\n\n341\n00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.936\nAnd an employee who's\nsupposed to be in the system.\n\n342\n00:15:34.936 --> 00:15:36.256\nThey're approved, right.\n\n343\n00:15:36.256 --> 00:15:40.020\nBut if they're unapproved person,\nwe don't want them connecting in.\n\n344\n00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.660\nAnd so we need good access\ncontrols on our system.\n\n345\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:47.178\nAnd you'll find where a lot of cloud\nplatforms support role-based access\n\n346\n00:15:47.178 --> 00:15:47.744\ncontrol.\n\n347\n00:15:47.744 --> 00:15:53.018\nHyper-V does, VMware vSphere does,\nAmazon's Web Services, Microsoft Azure.\n\n348\n00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:55.711\nThey all support role\nbased access control.\n\n349\n00:15:55.711 --> 00:15:58.384\nAnd that's where,\nyou don't just create users and\n\n350\n00:15:58.384 --> 00:16:00.518\ngive them permissions you create roles.\n\n351\n00:16:00.518 --> 00:16:03.226\nAnd now, as you create more users,\nyou assign a role to them, and\n\n352\n00:16:03.226 --> 00:16:06.090\nthey get whatever\npermissions that role has.\n\n353\n00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.020\nRoles help us to be consistent.\n\n354\n00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.940\nSo, if I have five employees\nwith the same job title,\n\n355\n00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.390\nthey all have the same permissions, right?\n\n356\n00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.510\nBecause I'm using a role instead of\npermissions on the individual users.\n\n357\n00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:18.610\nThe other advantage is that we have\na lot more granular control and\n\n358\n00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.215\nreusability on these things.\n\n359\n00:16:20.215 --> 00:16:25.740\nRole-based access control lets us fall\ninto that principle of least privilege.\n\n360\n00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.610\nYou never wanna give somebody more\naccess than they absolutely need.\n\n361\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.490\nSo you can create a role that has\nthe bare minimum access needed.\n\n362\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.710\nAnd then you put people in that role and\n\n363\n00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.740\nthey get the access and they're able\nto kind of watch on from there.\n\n364\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.250\nSo I want to kinda show you\nguys a demonstration of that.\n\n365\n00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:44.170\n>> And now if I understand also too\nlike for instance inside of Intune and\n\n366\n00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.970\nstuff you might not have to\ncreate some of the roles.\n\n367\n00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.070\nSome of the roles might be pre-created,\nright.\n\n368\n00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.140\nSo for\ninstance like your billing administrator,\n\n369\n00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.000\nyour service administrator,\npassword administrator,\n\n370\n00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.260\nand this would still be a form of\nrole-based access control, right?\n\n371\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.190\nBecause even though it's\na pre-created role,\n\n372\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.830\nyou do attach a user to that as well,\nright?\n\n373\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.160\n>> Yeah.\nAnd often\n\n374\n00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.820\nthe pre-created roles meet all our needs.\n\n375\n00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.210\nLike in Hyper-V,\nI rarely have to create an extra ones.\n\n376\n00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.730\nIf you actually have\nthe System Center Virtual Machine Manager,\n\n377\n00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.728\nthe roles that they've got\npre-built are pretty good.\n\n378\n00:17:14.728 --> 00:17:18.350\nYou've got read-only admins,\nadmins that have full control,\n\n379\n00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:21.730\nyou've got people that are allowed to\npower on and power off virtual machines,\n\n380\n00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.090\nit might be a Help Desk role.\n\n381\n00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:25.610\nBut you might need to create your\nown roles, that you might have\n\n382\n00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:29.550\na purchasing agent, that you need to be\nable to see your billing information.\n\n383\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.870\nYou don't want them to\nmanage your servers, but\n\n384\n00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.250\nyou want them to see\nthe billing information, so\n\n385\n00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.520\nyou might have to create roles.\n\n386\n00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.420\nLet me show you some examples\nof how these roles work.\n\n387\n00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.490\nI'm here in VMWare vSphere, and\n\n388\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:43.450\nin VMWare you actually have role-based\nadministration right in here.\n\n389\n00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.970\nSo, when I'm on my homepage here, I go\ndown to administration, and this is just\n\n390\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:53.300\nthe VCenter web client, and I can see\nright here at the top, access control and\n\n391\n00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.750\nroles, and here's some of those built-in\nroles that Wes was talking about.\n\n392\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:57.748\nI didn't make any of these.\n\n393\n00:17:57.748 --> 00:18:01.370\nRight?\nAdministrator, Read-only, No access,\n\n394\n00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:07.850\nResource Pool Administrator,\nand oops, Virtual machine user,\n\n395\n00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:12.960\nTagging Admin, VMware Consolidated Backup\nuser, all these different roles.\n\n396\n00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.350\nAnd some of them are just samples that\nwe might need to tweak, Datastore or\n\n397\n00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.440\nwhatever I can use these roles.\n\n398\n00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.080\nI can just use these roles\nright here if I want, or\n\n399\n00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:26.160\nI can take these roles and\ncopy them and tweak them to my needs.\n\n400\n00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.720\nRight?\n\n401\n00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.790\nSo when we go to add a new role, if I\nwant to create something from scratch,\n\n402\n00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.420\nI don't have to do it from scratch.\n\n403\n00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:37.690\nI can duplicate an existing role, see I\ncan clone a role action I can take a role\n\n404\n00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.440\nthat already exists and just clone it,\nand then customize that to meet my needs.\n\n405\n00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.030\nI might want somebody to be\nan administrator, but only for\n\n406\n00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:48.370\na certain set of VMware hosts, right?\n\n407\n00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:49.960\nNot all of them, but a particular group.\n\n408\n00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.270\nAnd so I can create that and define it.\n\n409\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.010\nAnd over here, I can see where\nthese permissions are used, and\n\n410\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.820\nwhat privileges I'm granting out.\n\n411\n00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.930\nWhat access are they getting?\n\n412\n00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.770\nAn administrator, you'd expect\nthem to have quite a bit of stuff.\n\n413\n00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:04.710\nBut if you go into a tagging admin, well\nsee how most of those check marks just\n\n414\n00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:09.420\ndisappeared, a tagging admin only gets\na subset of those permissions and\n\n415\n00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.350\nthey don't have that full access\nlike an administrator does.\n\n416\n00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:16.280\nSo creating these roles is\na really important task.\n\n417\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.030\nI need to make sure that I've got this\nset they way that I need it to be.\n\n418\n00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.890\nAnd looking in here I don't have anybody\nlike a purchasing agent or whatever, so\n\n419\n00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.010\nI might want to create a customer role for\nthat.\n\n420\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.040\nAnd when you create these roles, what it's\ngonna do, is it's basically gonna ask you\n\n421\n00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.650\nto specify what that name is gonna be, and\nthen what access you want them to have.\n\n422\n00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.650\nSo maybe I wanna create a help desk role.\n\n423\n00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.840\nAnd this is gonna be for\nmy help desk employees.\n\n424\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.700\nAnd I might want them to be\nable to see a lot of stuff, but\n\n425\n00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.510\nnot change a lot of stuff, right?\n\n426\n00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.260\nI might want them to be able\nto acknowledge an alarm.\n\n427\n00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.800\nSo if an alarm goes off in the system,\nthey can acknowledge that they've seen it\n\n428\n00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.540\nand they're taking action and I might want\nthem to be able to set an alarm status to\n\n429\n00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.700\nturn alarm on if they've detected\nsomething or turn it off, but\n\n430\n00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.370\nI might not want them to be able to\ncreate, disable, or modify the alarms.\n\n431\n00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.790\nSo now I can specify that access so\nwhen they connect to the system,\n\n432\n00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.470\nthat's all they're going to\nhave is that permission, right,\n\n433\n00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.980\ngiving them just the minimum they need.\n\n434\n00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.990\nIf I made them a full administrator\nthey could do what they needed and\n\n435\n00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.690\nthey could do a lot more, and\nI don't want that, right?\n\n436\n00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.610\nSo it's important that we use that\nprinciple of least privilege,\n\n437\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:25.210\nright, just give them the bare minimum\naccess necessary, apparently the window's\n\n438\n00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.210\ngonna fall on me, the bare minimum\naccess necessary to do their job.\n\n439\n00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.280\nThat's a critical concept.\n\n440\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.190\nAll right, so role based access control,\nreally easy to do.\n\n441\n00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.270\nIt's basically groups, right?\n\n442\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.020\nExcept it's based around that job title,\nand\n\n443\n00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.810\nthen we just put the users in the role.\n\n444\n00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.710\nI showed it to you here in VMware.\n\n445\n00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:44.810\nBut even AWS and other products like that,\nthey have the same thing, right?\n\n446\n00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.010\nSo here I am in the AWS console.\n\n447\n00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:51.034\nAnd if I go into their Identity &\nAccess Management which is right here,\n\n448\n00:20:51.034 --> 00:20:53.490\nyou'll see where I can create users.\n\n449\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.370\nRight, and so I've got users created for\na lot of the show hosts here.\n\n450\n00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.910\nBut i know the roles, and\nI can start to create roles for people.\n\n451\n00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.530\nWhat I want them to do, like do i want\nthem next as ops works, cloud watch and so\n\n452\n00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:05.240\non, you know?\n\n453\n00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.470\nWhat permissions do I want\nto grant up to those people,\n\n454\n00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.780\nthen I just assign people to those roles.\n\n455\n00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.500\nYou're gonna achieve the same\nthing with groups, but\n\n456\n00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.350\nsometimes groups have different\nconnotations, the roles.\n\n457\n00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.890\nA group for example is normally built\naround just users that are hearing your\n\n458\n00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:21.550\naccount, versus a role that can\nhandle people from your account and\n\n459\n00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.950\npeople from external accounts, right?\n\n460\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.630\nAnd I'm gonna talk about external\naccounts here in a minute but for\n\n461\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.860\nright now let's just\nkind of leave it at that.\n\n462\n00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.710\nWe can create these roles and\ngroups, assign permissions, then and\n\n463\n00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:32.730\nput people in those groups.\n\n464\n00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:33.870\nReal, real important concept.\n\n465\n00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:34.390\n>> That's great.\n\n466\n00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.580\nNow one that's coming up that we have\nto talk about, if I understand right,\n\n467\n00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.890\nis a very expensive implementation.\n\n468\n00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.725\nAnd one of the common\nplaces that we see this,\n\n469\n00:21:41.725 --> 00:21:45.025\nsomething known as\nmandatory access control.\n\n470\n00:21:45.025 --> 00:21:46.795\nOne of the things that I think of is, for\n\n471\n00:21:46.795 --> 00:21:50.705\ninstance Military, document classification\nversus whatever the security\n\n472\n00:21:50.705 --> 00:21:54.265\nclassification is on the person that\nmight be accessing that resource.\n\n473\n00:21:54.265 --> 00:21:57.065\n>> Yeah so when we do access control\nlike this, you set up a roll and\n\n474\n00:21:57.065 --> 00:21:58.605\nstart giving it permissions.\n\n475\n00:21:58.605 --> 00:22:02.520\nThe way those permissions are managed\nfalls into two main categories.\n\n476\n00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.790\nThere's actually a ton of\ncategories out there, but\n\n477\n00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.280\nthe two that CompTIA cares about\nare mandatory access controls and\n\n478\n00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.540\ndiscretionary access controls.\n\n479\n00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:13.590\nMandatory access controls are ones that\nare administered by the administrator.\n\n480\n00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.710\nI guess I kinda got redundant there,\nbut as the administrator for\n\n481\n00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.850\nyour IT infrastructure, you control\nthe permissions the end users don't.\n\n482\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.650\nSo you grant somebody permissions, and\nthey've now got them, but they have no\n\n483\n00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.150\ncontrol over those permissions at all,\nthey just got it and that's it.\n\n484\n00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:29.770\nEvery time they create a virtual machine,\n\n485\n00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.010\nevery time they create a VPC,\nevery time they create a resource\n\n486\n00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:37.260\nthey've got to come to you to get those\npermissions set to be put in place.\n\n487\n00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.180\nThey are mandatory the end users\nhave absolutely no say in that\n\n488\n00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.320\nit's being assigned.\n\n489\n00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.970\nThe technical definition or\nthe template for\n\n490\n00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:48.180\napplying mandatory access controls is\nthat it's actually made up of two pieces.\n\n491\n00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.500\nYou've got a classification and\na category.\n\n492\n00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.290\nThe classification is really designed for\nmilitary use like Wes was talking about.\n\n493\n00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:59.660\nYou know, where something might be\ntop secret or just plain old secret.\n\n494\n00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.460\nIt might be sensitive, but unclassified.\n\n495\n00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.790\nIt might be unclassified, right?\n\n496\n00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.020\nJust public information.\n\n497\n00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:10.155\nAnd so that's gonna determine how\nmuch security we need to apply to it.\n\n498\n00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:12.805\nI know we got the category which could\nbe kinda what this data falls into and\n\n499\n00:23:12.805 --> 00:23:14.855\nwhere we actually assign\nthe permissions to it.\n\n500\n00:23:14.855 --> 00:23:17.325\nBut when we apply in a virtualization\nenvironment we don't normally think\n\n501\n00:23:17.325 --> 00:23:17.995\nabout those things.\n\n502\n00:23:17.995 --> 00:23:20.975\nI don't think like this VM is top secret.\n\n503\n00:23:20.975 --> 00:23:22.725\nThis VM is sensitive but unclassified.\n\n504\n00:23:22.725 --> 00:23:23.635\nI don't think that.\n\n505\n00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:26.770\nI think this virtual machine is in a DMZ.\n\n506\n00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.800\nThis virtual machine is on\nmy local area network and\n\n507\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.960\nI've got different security principles.\n\n508\n00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.680\nI want a virtual machine on my local\narea network to be far more secure\n\n509\n00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.430\nas far as Internet\ntraffic than my DMZ one.\n\n510\n00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:42.620\nI know what you're thinking, like, don't\nyou want your DMZ service to be secure?\n\n511\n00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.650\nWell, if I have a web server in my DMZ I\n\n512\n00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.000\nwant the whole world to be able\nto get to that web server, right.\n\n513\n00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.460\nIf I have a web server on\nmy local area network.\n\n514\n00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.750\nI don't want anybody\ngetting to that web server.\n\n515\n00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:58.572\nSo you see where a local server is far\nmore secure, far more restricted access.\n\n516\n00:23:58.572 --> 00:24:00.822\nAnd those mandatory access\ncontrols that we define,\n\n517\n00:24:00.822 --> 00:24:04.028\nthe administrator defines though and\nthey are fixed and they're in place.\n\n518\n00:24:04.028 --> 00:24:07.838\n>> One of the things that I think is\ninteresting about the mandatory access\n\n519\n00:24:07.838 --> 00:24:12.411\ncontrol is, like you were talking about,\nrole based access control, you don't get\n\n520\n00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:16.473\naccess if you're not in that role, and\nsomebody has to put you in that rule,\n\n521\n00:24:16.473 --> 00:24:20.984\nwhere mandatory access control, there's\ntwo things being calculated here to find\n\n522\n00:24:20.984 --> 00:24:23.430\nout if you have access\nto a certain resource.\n\n523\n00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.940\nWhatever the classification\nof the documentation is and\n\n524\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.000\nsensitivity level of the information\nof the resource itself.\n\n525\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:34.670\n>> And on the discretionary side,\ndiscretionary access control, this is\n\n526\n00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:38.080\nwhere as the administrator you probably\ndo still set up the provisions right?\n\n527\n00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.880\nBut once somebody's been granted access,\nthey can then either\n\n528\n00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.650\nchange that access or even grant\nthe access to other people, right?\n\n529\n00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.970\nSo if I had a virtual machine, and I give\nWes full administrative control of that\n\n530\n00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:55.320\nvirtual machine, Wes could log into\nthe VM and start creating accounts for\n\n531\n00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.890\nother people, and give other people\naccess to that virtual machine.\n\n532\n00:24:58.890 --> 00:24:59.710\nI didn't do that.\n\n533\n00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.060\nAs the administrator, I give him access.\n\n534\n00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.070\nBut I allowed him to be able to\nprovide access to other people.\n\n535\n00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.630\nAnd that may or may not be what I want.\n\n536\n00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.780\nIf I want to give him a VM, and\nyeah, he's going to run it.\n\n537\n00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.290\nI'll let him do whatever he want's.\n\n538\n00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.460\nAnd that's fine.\n\n539\n00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.720\nBut if I didn't want that,\nthen I've kind of deviated.\n\n540\n00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.880\nAnd now I need to get back to\nthe mandatory side of things.\n\n541\n00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.450\nBut discretionary access control is\nwhere whoever receives that access\n\n542\n00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.480\ncan in turn modify the access or\nshare it with other people.\n\n543\n00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.330\nAnd that can be a whole can of worms.\n\n544\n00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.420\nIf you're trying to certify\ndata integrity, right?\n\n545\n00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.160\nIf you've got to meet regulatory\ncompliance, or chain of custody, or\n\n546\n00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.320\nwhatever, then discretionary access\ncontrol is not your friend, right.\n\n547\n00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.453\nBecause you just don't,\nyou lose that control.\n\n548\n00:25:34.453 --> 00:25:35.135\nAnd mandatory is all you want.\n\n549\n00:25:36.555 --> 00:25:38.765\nAll right, so those are some of\nthe access control features.\n\n550\n00:25:38.765 --> 00:25:42.826\nAnd I know I talked about an AWS,\nI talked about a V sphere, a VMware, but\n\n551\n00:25:42.826 --> 00:25:45.975\nthe same thing applies to hyper V,\ncircuit zen server.\n\n552\n00:25:45.975 --> 00:25:50.465\nAnd they all got access controls, like\nthat, it just depends on the platform.\n\n553\n00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.970\nThe last thing that I want to talk\nabout are the user accounts themselves.\n\n554\n00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.130\nWhen you log in to your\nvirtualization platform,\n\n555\n00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.070\nwhere does your account come from?\n\n556\n00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.180\nWho is it that is this account?\n\n557\n00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.790\nAnd it depends.\n\n558\n00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:08.290\nA lot of times it comes from\nthe account right here in the system.\n\n559\n00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.710\nIn my VMware VSphere environment, I'm\nactually logging in with an administrator\n\n560\n00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:18.130\naccount that is right here in this system,\nthat is a part of this vSphere install.\n\n561\n00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:22.160\nSo if I go to another vSphere system,\nI'm not going to have this account,\n\n562\n00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:22.780\nit's just here.\n\n563\n00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.030\nAnd my Amazon Web Services stuff,\n\n564\n00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.670\nI'm logging in with an account that's\nright there in Amazon Web Services,\n\n565\n00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.920\nand that means that I've got a username\nand password here on the ITProTV network,\n\n566\n00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.540\nI've got a username and\npassword up in Amazon Web Services, and\n\n567\n00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.230\nI've got a username and\npassword here in this vSphere environment.\n\n568\n00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:42.150\nI've got several usernames and passwords,\nseveral identities that I have to manage.\n\n569\n00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:45.070\nA lot of people don't like that and\nit is frustrating and annoying to do.\n\n570\n00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:49.590\nSo many of your virtualization platforms\nwill offer this guy right here,\n\n571\n00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.550\nsingle sign on.\n\n572\n00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:55.290\nAnd what Single Sign On allows you\nto do is to provide access to user\n\n573\n00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.330\naccounts that don't exist here\nin your local environment, but\n\n574\n00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:01.050\nexist in some other\ndirectories somewhere else.\n\n575\n00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:04.110\nSo maybe your company has a full\nActive Directory Deployment, right?\n\n576\n00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.980\nYou have Microsoft Active Directory,\neverybody's got a username and password.\n\n577\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.970\nWouldn't it be nice if they could log\ninto the vCenter management screen\n\n578\n00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.590\nusing that same username and password?\n\n579\n00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.590\nWouldn't it be nice if they could log\ninto AWS, or Office 365, Microsoft Azure,\n\n580\n00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.140\nwhatever and use that same account.\n\n581\n00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:24.280\nAnd that way if they have to reset their\npassword, it's reset across the board.\n\n582\n00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.540\nThat's what single sign\non allows you to do.\n\n583\n00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.130\nWhat you're creating is what's\ncalled a Federated Service.\n\n584\n00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.020\nA Federated Service is where you\nhave one security infrastructure,\n\n585\n00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.300\nsome kind of directory and\nyou create a federation of link\n\n586\n00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.430\nbetween your directory and\nsomebody else's directory, and so\n\n587\n00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:45.040\nwhen I come here in the VMware Vsphere,\nand I go into single sign on and users and\n\n588\n00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.300\ngroups, I'm seeing the users and\ngroups from everything I'm federated with.\n\n589\n00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.900\nAnd right now I'm only\nfederated with myself.\n\n590\n00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.390\nI've got this logo, my accounts\nhave to exist here in V sphere.\n\n591\n00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.930\nBut if I go down to\nconfiguration I can come in and\n\n592\n00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:02.170\nI can start to create identity sources.\n\n593\n00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.720\nIdentity sources are other places\nwhere we can get credentials from.\n\n594\n00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.820\nAnd you'll notice I've got vsphere.local,\nthat's the V sphere deployment, and\n\n595\n00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.480\nI've got my virtual machine's\nlocal operating system accounts.\n\n596\n00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.140\nThis particular v center\nserver is running on I\n\n597\n00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.200\nthink I'm running on Windows Server 2008.\n\n598\n00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.000\nAnd so I have local accounts\nthere that I could use.\n\n599\n00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.600\nBut what if I had an active directory?\n\n600\n00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.280\nWell I can hit this little\nplus sign right here and\n\n601\n00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.690\nI can connect to Active Directory,\nintegrated with Windows authentication.\n\n602\n00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.290\nI can do Active Directory just\nas a generic LDAP server.\n\n603\n00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:36.740\nI can do an open LDAP server or my local\nOS which I'm already connected to.\n\n604\n00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.480\nOpen LDAP, that'll let me connect to all\nsorts of things like a Nobel e-directory,\n\n605\n00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.850\nthere's still plenty of people who use\nthat, an Apple open directory, open LDAP,\n\n606\n00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:49.000\nif you're just running yourself or\neven third party providers,\n\n607\n00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.690\nyou might have chivolith running in your\nnetwork, and you can connect to that using\n\n608\n00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:56.220\nOpen LDAP and start to authenticate\nagainst darn near anything.\n\n609\n00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.590\nAnd now people have that one\naccount they log in with.\n\n610\n00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:04.380\nBut the roles would still\nexist right here in vSphere.\n\n611\n00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.280\nSo in vSphere I'd have to create\nthe roles, but the identities that I\n\n612\n00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.090\nput in it might be coming from\nActive Directory or somewhere else.\n\n613\n00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:13.560\nAnd if I choose Active Directory, I would\nneed to come in and specify a domain name\n\n614\n00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.440\nand a user account to connect to it, and\nthen it'll establish that connection, and\n\n615\n00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.730\nonce it's attached, now I have\naccess to the whole user data base.\n\n616\n00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:24.230\nAll right, so that single sign on and\nfederated services,\n\n617\n00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.040\ndifferent people have different\nkind of names for it, but\n\n618\n00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.090\nthose are the two main names\nthat your going to see on there.\n\n619\n00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:33.310\n>> Now that does look like it presents\nwell, it's a ease of use, any time we say\n\n620\n00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:37.230\nease of use, we also sometimes talk about\nreduce with a little bit of security, Don.\n\n621\n00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:38.290\nIf I've got a single sign on,\n\n622\n00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:42.680\nI only need a single password, and if that\nsingle password is compromised, then,\n\n623\n00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.080\nwell they can, pretty much,\naccess any service they want?\n\n624\n00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.415\n>> Well, so\nthere's two sides of this argument, right?\n\n625\n00:29:48.415 --> 00:29:49.705\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That's one side.\n\n626\n00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:51.150\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If Wes has one account that he\n\n627\n00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.040\nuses on 10 different systems,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n628\n00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.580\n>> And that one account gets compromised,\nall 10 systems are compromised, right?\n\n629\n00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.825\nSo, it sounds like security's weakened.\n\n630\n00:29:56.825 --> 00:29:57.900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n631\n00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.940\nBut you could also argue\nthat security's increased.\n\n632\n00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:01.720\nLet me give you an example.\n\n633\n00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.880\nSo Wes, for a brief moment I\nbrought up the AWS screen and\n\n634\n00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.770\nI showed users that had administrative\naccess and then your name is in that list.\n\n635\n00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:13.030\n>> All right.\n>> So, I have granted you access to AWS.\n\n636\n00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.170\nDid you know that?\n\n637\n00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:14.732\n>> No.\nI do now.\n\n638\n00:30:14.732 --> 00:30:18.960\n>> [LAUGH] So, I created an account for\nyou and I gave you access.\n\n639\n00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.980\nNow, I've created that account for you\na long time ago, November 17th of 2015,\n\n640\n00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:29.243\nso that's what, three,\nfour months ago, right?\n\n641\n00:30:29.243 --> 00:30:32.880\nNow, I've created that account, it's\nactually four months, three months ago.\n\n642\n00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.680\nAll right, so three months ago\nI created that account for you.\n\n643\n00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.490\nI never told you.\n\n644\n00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:36.440\nAnd so it's got a password.\n\n645\n00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.570\n>> That's probably a good thing.\n\n646\n00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:39.670\n>> And that password has\nnever been changed because\n\n647\n00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:41.000\nyou didn't know about the account.\n\n648\n00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.320\nBut even if I told the account,\n\n649\n00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.340\nthe odds are you wouldn't have changed\nthe password unless it expired.\n\n650\n00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.490\nRight?\nThat's how people are.\n\n651\n00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:48.810\nAnd in AWS, you actually can set\na password expiration policy now, but\n\n652\n00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:49.590\nyou used to not be able to.\n\n653\n00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:52.630\nAnd so they could have this password for\na long time.\n\n654\n00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.680\nSo if that password never expires,\nand Wesley uses the same password for\n\n655\n00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.180\na long period of time,\nthat makes it vulnerable.\n\n656\n00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.620\nBut if I link this to\nthe Active Directory,\n\n657\n00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.930\nlike we use Office 365 here at ITPro TV.\n\n658\n00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.930\nAnd Wes, how often does your\nOffice 365 password expire.\n\n659\n00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.820\n>> I think it's once every thirty days.\n\n660\n00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.090\nI don't know,\nI think that's about what it is.\n\n661\n00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.010\n>> It's frequently enough\nto be super annoying to me.\n\n662\n00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.970\n>> It is.\n>> It really ticks me off.\n\n663\n00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:14.530\n>> Thanks Don.\n\n664\n00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:15.830\n>> But it is, it's like every 30 days.\n\n665\n00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.860\nSo every 30 days you have\nto change that password.\n\n666\n00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.230\nAnd you do it because your forced to,\nright.\n\n667\n00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:24.420\nIf this was a single sign on environment,\nwhen you change that Office 365 password\n\n668\n00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:28.220\nevery 30 days, you'd effectively\nbe changing this password too.\n\n669\n00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.590\nAnd so now I can enforce minimum\npassword requirements and password age\n\n670\n00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:37.260\nrequirements, complexity and so on because\nactive directory gives me all that power.\n\n671\n00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.520\nWhereas AWS might not.\n\n672\n00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.560\nSo I'm actually improving my\nsecurity by doing that and\n\n673\n00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.872\nthe other thing is if I disable your\naccount like if I disable Wes's account\n\n674\n00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:51.290\noffice 365, he just loss access to AWS as\nwell as the active directory as well as\n\n675\n00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.500\nthe other recourses here,\none place to go to disable him.\n\n676\n00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.380\nVersus if you had all these separate\naccounts which give you the illusion of\n\n677\n00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.000\nsecurity, now when we fire Wes.\n\n678\n00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.695\nNot if, but when.\n\n679\n00:32:00.695 --> 00:32:02.242\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When we fire Wes, [LAUGH],\n\n680\n00:32:02.242 --> 00:32:04.761\nit'll be a matter of all right\nwhat accounts did he have?\n\n681\n00:32:04.761 --> 00:32:05.435\nLet me go check this system.\n\n682\n00:32:05.435 --> 00:32:06.131\nYep he's got one there.\n\n683\n00:32:06.131 --> 00:32:06.712\nLet me disable that.\n\n684\n00:32:06.712 --> 00:32:08.378\nLet me go over here and\nAnd you gotta hunt and\n\n685\n00:32:08.378 --> 00:32:10.473\nfind all these things versus\none account to disable.\n\n686\n00:32:10.473 --> 00:32:11.910\nSo single sign-on and\n\n687\n00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:17.210\nfederated services definitely can improve\nyour security not increase your risk.\n\n688\n00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:18.980\nBe careful with how you look at that.\n\n689\n00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.830\nBut also be careful with the fact that if\nI'm gonna link AWS to my active directory,\n\n690\n00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:26.185\nit goes way back to something we talked\nabout in the last episode which was\n\n691\n00:32:26.185 --> 00:32:27.241\nVPN tunnels, right.\n\n692\n00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:32.395\nIf I'm gonna link them like Azure to\nmy Active Directory which is internal,\n\n693\n00:32:32.395 --> 00:32:36.190\nI really wanna have that VPN\ntunnel between me and them.\n\n694\n00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.870\nI don't want them sending unencrypted\nauthentication communications\n\n695\n00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:40.050\nacross the Internet.\n\n696\n00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.460\nThat'd be pretty bad, right?\n\n697\n00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.760\nSo that's kinda the flip\nside of that coin, but\n\n698\n00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.530\nthat is single sign-on\nin federated services.\n\n699\n00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.135\nIt's really complex to get it set up,\nit's actually kinda hard to get it set up.\n\n700\n00:32:48.135 --> 00:32:51.671\nBut once it's in place it works great and\nyou get that reliable communications and\n\n701\n00:32:51.671 --> 00:32:54.439\nyour users will appreciate it cuz\nthey have just one user name and\n\n702\n00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:56.400\npassword they apparently have to remember.\n\n703\n00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.620\n>> All right, very good information.\n\n704\n00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.540\nLot of good information in this episode.\n\n705\n00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.460\nWe have talked about some of the types\nof attacks that you can see.\n\n706\n00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.940\nRemember distributed\ndenial of service attack?\n\n707\n00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.380\nWe've also talked about some of\nthe different access control methods and\n\n708\n00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.580\nthere are a bunch of them.\n\n709\n00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.680\nI've taken quite a few\nof these CompTIA exams.\n\n710\n00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.980\nYou can expect a scenario or\ntwo that's gonna test your knowledge\n\n711\n00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.500\non whether you know what kind\nof method they're using.\n\n712\n00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.710\nWe've also talked about single sign-on and\nfederated services.\n\n713\n00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:21.920\nSo a lot of good information.\n\n714\n00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.490\nDon, you got anything else for us?\n\n715\n00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:24.490\n>> I forgot to mention one thing.\n\n716\n00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:25.830\nLet me just throw it in\nright here at the end.\n\n717\n00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.110\nI know we're low on time.\n\n718\n00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.580\nMFA, multi-factor authentication.\n\n719\n00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.390\nMost of us are used to authenticating\nwith just a username and a password.\n\n720\n00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:34.100\nIt's really common, it's out there.\n\n721\n00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.740\nBut your virtualization\ninfrastructure is really sensitive.\n\n722\n00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.980\nIf somebody gets in there,\nthey could shut off all your servers or\n\n723\n00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.600\nrun you broke by spinning up fake servers.\n\n724\n00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.590\nIt's definitely something\nyou wanna protect from.\n\n725\n00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:46.370\nSo multi-factor authentication, where\nyou log in with not just a username and\n\n726\n00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:50.150\na password but something else,\ntypically a code.\n\n727\n00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:53.060\nGenerated by software running\non your cellphone or a token,\n\n728\n00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.280\na hardware token that you plug in,\nsome secondary form.\n\n729\n00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.630\nAnd most providers support it.\n\n730\n00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:59.640\nLet me show you here in AWS real quick.\n\n731\n00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.910\nSo I'm logged into AWS, and\n\n732\n00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:05.550\nif I go into my account settings I'm\ngonna jump into my security credentials.\n\n733\n00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.372\nAnd when I look at my\nsecurity credentials,\n\n734\n00:34:08.372 --> 00:34:12.130\nsee how I've got a password set and\nso I can change my password.\n\n735\n00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:14.877\nBut right after that I've got\nmuilti-factor authentication.\n\n736\n00:34:14.877 --> 00:34:17.000\nI can activate MFA.\n\n737\n00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.980\nAnd now whenever I go to log in it's not\njust gonna ask me for a username and\n\n738\n00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:25.210\npassword, but it's gonna ask me for a code\nalso and I use the heck out of this stuff.\n\n739\n00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.240\nLet me, where's my cell phone?\n\n740\n00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.700\nI use this for\na number of different services and\n\n741\n00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:33.960\nit's really cool because when you wanna\ngo log into a system you're gonna log in.\n\n742\n00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.470\nAnd I don't know if we can show this.\n\n743\n00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:38.380\nMaybe if we go full screen on me or\nsomething.\n\n744\n00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:41.850\nBut basically when you go to log in you\npunch in your username and password and\n\n745\n00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.380\nthen on your device you'll have a code.\n\n746\n00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.930\nAnd yeah,\nI guess it doesn't really show up, but\n\n747\n00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:50.030\nthat code is constantly changing\nevery 30 seconds or every 60 seconds.\n\n748\n00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:52.415\nAnd so for\nsomebody to know your username and\n\n749\n00:34:52.415 --> 00:34:55.070\npassword they would have\nto know this code also.\n\n750\n00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.590\nAnd if they don't have that, they're\nnot gonna be able to log in as you.\n\n751\n00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:01.350\nSo MFA, multi-factor authentication,\ndefinitely something to look into for\n\n752\n00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.790\nyour virtualization environment,\nand really look into it for\n\n753\n00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:07.070\nanywhere, but definitely for your VM\ninfrastructure, cuz it's so sensitive.\n\n754\n00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.270\nIf somebody gets in there,\nimagine somebody logging in and\n\n755\n00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.140\nshutting down all your\nservers at the same time.\n\n756\n00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.390\nJust, you immediately have\na company-wide outage, right?\n\n757\n00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:15.420\nThat's the type of thing\nthat could happen.\n\n758\n00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.030\n>> Great information,\nDon, thanks for that.\n\n759\n00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:20.180\nWe've got a wealth of information\nthat we discussed in this episode,\n\n760\n00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.150\nbut we've got more coming up\nin our security concepts.\n\n761\n00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:25.525\nBut we're gonna have to save that for\nanother episode.\n\n762\n00:35:25.525 --> 00:35:27.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I guess we talked too much on this one.\n\n763\n00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.050\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n764\n00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.740\nI've been your host here at ITProTV,\nWes Bryan.\n\n765\n00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.550\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n766\n00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.083\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n767\n00:35:34.083 --> 00:35:42.510\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.340\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.360\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna be moving along in Cloud Plus.\n\n5\n00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.640\nAnd we're actually into a part\nthree of security concepts.\n\n6\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.600\nThat's right, we've got so\n\n7\n00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.380\nmuch amazing content we couldn't\nfit it in just two episodes.\n\n8\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.740\nSo we're now going into a part three.\n\n9\n00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.710\nWe've got Mr.\nDon Pezet here to help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.870\nDon, how you doing today, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.720\nI'm doing great, Wes, thanks for having\nme back on, and giving me the chance to\n\n12\n00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.980\nkind of wrap up some of the thoughts\nthat we didn't quite get to in part two.\n\n13\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.040\nIn this episode we wanna take\na little bit of time to focus on\n\n14\n00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.790\ndata encryption, right.\n\n15\n00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.782\nWe've mentioned VPN tunnels and\nother things that use encryption.\n\n16\n00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:48.350\nWe wanna talk a little bit\nabout how encryption works and\n\n17\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.810\nthe different types of encryption\nprotocols that are out there.\n\n18\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.060\nThese are all things you'll encounter\nas you set up your private cloud.\n\n19\n00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.870\nYou'll have to choose what\nencryption type you're gonna use.\n\n20\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.940\nAnd believe me,\nthey're not all created equally,\n\n21\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.450\nsome types are better than others.\n\n22\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.440\nSo you have to have a good understanding\nof that and just some basic history to it.\n\n23\n00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.590\nCompTIA specifically calls out\na number of encryption protocols\n\n24\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.280\nright there in the exam objectives.\n\n25\n00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.370\nSo we're just gonna run through those and\n\n26\n00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.580\nmake sure you're familiar with\nthe ones that you need to know.\n\n27\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.145\nNow obviously if you wanna learn a lot\nmore about these, you can jump over to our\n\n28\n00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:18.200\nSecurity+ Training,\nyou'll see all of it in-depth over there.\n\n29\n00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.750\nBut here, we're gonna take a look\nat really what's important from\n\n30\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.420\na practical sense.\n\n31\n00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.620\nWhat you're gonna be applying\nout there in the real world.\n\n32\n00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.310\nAll right, very good.\n\n33\n00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.110\nSo some of the things that we gotta\ntalk about is obviously encryption.\n\n34\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.730\nAnd there's multiple forms of encryption.\n\n35\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.400\nWhich one you choose really\ndepends on what are you doing?\n\n36\n00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.600\nYou might say,\nwell some are better than others.\n\n37\n00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.010\nBut well it really depends on how much\ncomputational power you have on hand or\n\n38\n00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.200\nmaybe the lack thereof.\n\n39\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.810\nSo where do we start here, sir?\n\n40\n00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.610\nWell, so we've got a few options here.\n\n41\n00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.940\nLet's try and just talk about\njust how encryption works, right?\n\n42\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.410\nWe'll start off real high-level.\n\n43\n00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.150\nSo when I'm talking about.\n\n44\n00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.850\nWait, let's go all\nthe way back to part one.\n\n45\n00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.460\nIn part one we started\ntalking about VPNs right?\n\n46\n00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.360\nSo I've got this diagram fired,\nthis is the same diagram I used before.\n\n47\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.070\nWhere I showed that we\nmight have our headquarters\n\n48\n00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.120\nconnected up to a cloud\nprovider like Microsoft Azure.\n\n49\n00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.580\nAnd if we do that, and we have\nsensitive data transiting the network.\n\n50\n00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.250\nWe might want to build a VPN tunnel\nbetween us and them, all right.\n\n51\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.310\nHow does that work?\n\n52\n00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.800\nHow does a VPN tunnel encrypt and\nsecure our data passing across the links?\n\n53\n00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.100\nIt might not even be this complex.\n\n54\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.600\nIt might be something simple like just\na customer browses to our website and\n\n55\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.740\nthey wanna use SSL or TLS, right?\n\n56\n00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.840\nThey wanna get an encrypted connection for\nviewing the web page.\n\n57\n00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.070\nSo now you're not securing all of your\ntraffic, you're just securing web traffic.\n\n58\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.110\nAt the end of the day they all work\noff of very similar principles.\n\n59\n00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.360\nBasically, one end of this tunnel has\nto have what's called a private key.\n\n60\n00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.210\nAnd that private key is\nreally just a string.\n\n61\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.560\nA series of letters and numbers,\n\n62\n00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.190\nmaybe even special characters that we\ncan use to encrypt and decrypt data.\n\n63\n00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.200\nA private key is very powerful.\n\n64\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.040\nIt's like a secret code\nword that you have to have.\n\n65\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.500\nIf I take my data and\nI encrypt it using that secret code word.\n\n66\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.680\nAnd then I send the data to Wes, and\nWes has the same secret code word.\n\n67\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.500\nHe can decrypt that data, right?\n\n68\n00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.950\nHe can decrypt it and\nsee it and understand it.\n\n69\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.790\nBut if you get the data without the key,\nit's useless to you, right?\n\n70\n00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.540\nYou can't decrypt it,\nyou can't read it, you can't see it.\n\n71\n00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.210\nAnd there's where you have your security,\nyou have your confidentiality.\n\n72\n00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.340\nIs what Wes pointed out in the other\nepisodes is the perfect term\n\n73\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.965\nfor that, right?\n\n74\n00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:22.730\nConfidentiality.\n\n75\n00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.650\nThe data can only be read by\nthe people we intend to read it,\n\n76\n00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.930\nthe people we've shared that key with.\n\n77\n00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.420\nSo, one of the first key principles that\nwe have to understand in encryption is,\n\n78\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.750\nwell they key, right,\nthat's a pretty key principle.\n\n79\n00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.690\nI'm gonna break into sad puns again.\n\n80\n00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.730\nSo there's the key, and\nalso the key exchange.\n\n81\n00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.780\nHow do we share that key?\n\n82\n00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.640\nI said if Wes has a copy of\nmy key he can read my data.\n\n83\n00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.790\nHow do we get the key to\nhim in the first place?\n\n84\n00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.360\nSo when you decide to encrypt data,\nthere's the process of creating and\n\n85\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.020\nusing the key.\n\n86\n00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.180\nAnd then there's the process of\nsharing the key with other people.\n\n87\n00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.240\nAnd there might be more than one key.\n\n88\n00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.720\nThe most common types of encryption\nwill use a public key, and\n\n89\n00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.230\na private key, right?\n\n90\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.680\nNow what is the difference between\na public key and a private key?\n\n91\n00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.320\nWell, I said a private key can be\nused to encrypt and decrypt data.\n\n92\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.800\nIt's the perfect solution, it can do both.\n\n93\n00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.700\nAnd I usually equate the private key to,\n\n94\n00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.860\nlike the old cereal box encryption\nrings that you'd get, right?\n\n95\n00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.050\nThe.\n\n96\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.718\nCap'n Crunch.\n\n97\n00:04:25.718 --> 00:04:29.000\nYeah, the Cap'n Crunch, or\nOrphan Annie, or whatever, you know,\n\n98\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.560\nyou get these little rings\n>> And\n\n99\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.230\nwhat it would have is the alphabet,\nA through Z.\n\n100\n00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.070\nAnd then each letter would\nhave a corresponding number.\n\n101\n00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.134\nSo A might be 52, and\nB might be 17, and C might be 31.\n\n102\n00:04:42.134 --> 00:04:46.400\nAnd then I could write a letter,\nwrite it out as just letters.\n\n103\n00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.060\nAnd take the ring and\nuse the ring and say, all right,\n\n104\n00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.100\nI'm gonna write the letter C.\n\n105\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.272\nI turn the ring to C and\nI see that it's number 17, and so\n\n106\n00:04:52.272 --> 00:04:54.460\nI write down 17 on a piece of paper.\n\n107\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.120\nAnd I go like that writing out the whole\nletter with numbers instead of my letters.\n\n108\n00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.390\nAnd when I send it to Wes,\nas long as Wes has that same ring as me?\n\n109\n00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.410\nHe can then do the same process\nto reverse the encryption.\n\n110\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.830\nThis is a terrible,\nit's just a substitution cypher.\n\n111\n00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.230\nIt's one of the weakest forms of\nencryption, cuz somebody can guess it.\n\n112\n00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.070\nBut the ring is acting\nas that private key.\n\n113\n00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.230\nThat's the piece that's\nencrypting that data.\n\n114\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.380\nNow that works great if Wes eats\nCap'n Crunch, and I eat Cap'n Crunch.\n\n115\n00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.170\nWe both have the same ring and off we go.\n\n116\n00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.370\nBut when you're dealing with the internet,\nright?\n\n117\n00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.020\nWhen I'm reaching out to a website for\n\n118\n00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.230\nthe first time,\nI've never talked to that website before.\n\n119\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.090\nHow do I get a secure communication with\nthat website I've never communicated\n\n120\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.250\nwith before?\n\n121\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.660\nWell, I need to share a private key.\n\n122\n00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.930\nBut I don't wanna send my\nprivate key over the internet.\n\n123\n00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.990\nCuz if somebody's monitoring that traffic,\n\n124\n00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.440\nthey can just intercept\nthe private key when I send it.\n\n125\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.290\nAnd so if that private key were\nto cross the internet from\n\n126\n00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.600\nmy client to a server or whatever.\n\n127\n00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.410\nAnybody in the middle of this\ncommunication could intercept\n\n128\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.770\nthat communication.\n\n129\n00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.020\nAnd now they've got the private key and\n\n130\n00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.030\nsure everything else I'm\nsending is encrypted.\n\n131\n00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.860\nBut they can decrypt it cuz\nthey've got the private key.\n\n132\n00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.410\nNow, when we're setting up\na virtualization environment,\n\n133\n00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:11.190\nwhere we control the servers or we sign\nup for Amazon AWS or Azure or whatever.\n\n134\n00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.350\nWe can securely transmit our\nprivate key up there and\n\n135\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.800\nwe can use the private key for everything.\n\n136\n00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.000\nBut if it's a one-time connection,\nthat private key kind of breaks down.\n\n137\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.080\nAnd so, what we end up having to do,\n\n138\n00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.320\nis use the private key in\ncombination with the public key.\n\n139\n00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.850\nA public key is derived\nfrom the private key.\n\n140\n00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.750\nYou use the private key\nto generate a public key.\n\n141\n00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:40.950\nAnd the public key allows people to\nencrypt data, but not decrypt data.\n\n142\n00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.320\nThey can only encrypt information, right?\n\n143\n00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.970\nSo I can send that public key across\nthe network, over to a client, right.\n\n144\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.850\nI lost it's name, there we go.\n\n145\n00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:52.825\nWell that was effective.\n\n146\n00:06:52.825 --> 00:06:59.200\n[LAUGH] So anyhow, so, I can send\nthat across and have that over here.\n\n147\n00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.570\nAnd now when the client\nis ready to send data,\n\n148\n00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.620\nit can encrypt data using the public\nkey and send the data to me.\n\n149\n00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.410\nAnd I've got the private key so\nI can decrypt it and I can read it, right?\n\n150\n00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.000\nIf somebody's watching this\ntraffic in the middle,\n\n151\n00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.930\nthey could intercept that public\nkey when it crosses the network.\n\n152\n00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.482\nAnd if they do, they can now\nencrypt data and send it to me.\n\n153\n00:07:19.482 --> 00:07:22.570\nBig deal,\nthey can encrypt data and send it.\n\n154\n00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.890\nThey can't decrypt data\nthat's being transmitted.\n\n155\n00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.410\nThey can't see the communication I'm\nhaving with this client over here, right?\n\n156\n00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.630\nThey can just send me data.\n\n157\n00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.300\nWell, the reality is, they can send me\ndata anyway, you don't have to encrypt it.\n\n158\n00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.240\nThey just send it play and text.\n\n159\n00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.840\nThey can send me all the data they want.\n\n160\n00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.490\nSo I don't really care about that, if they\nintercept the public, I'm fine with that.\n\n161\n00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.670\nBecause they can't do anything with them,\nright?\n\n162\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.400\nThat's the advantage of\nhaving that public key.\n\n163\n00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.262\nBut the real challenge there is,\nnow the client can encrypt data and\n\n164\n00:07:47.262 --> 00:07:48.697\nsend it to me encrypted.\n\n165\n00:07:48.697 --> 00:07:52.646\nBut I can't send data back to the client\nbecause the client doesn't have\n\n166\n00:07:52.646 --> 00:07:54.534\na way to decrypt the data, right?\n\n167\n00:07:54.534 --> 00:07:59.941\nSo this type of key exchange Is\nnot terribly effective by itself.\n\n168\n00:07:59.941 --> 00:08:03.641\nIt's usually got to be combined with\nsome other kind of key exchange so\n\n169\n00:08:03.641 --> 00:08:06.730\nthat we can get two-way communications,\nright?\n\n170\n00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.760\nFor example, the other side might\ngenerate its own private key and\n\n171\n00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.540\nthen generate a public based on that and\nhand it to me.\n\n172\n00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:18.660\nAnd so now we've got two different private\nkeys and two different public keys,\n\n173\n00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.870\nbut that generates a lot of processor\noverhead, a lot of extra work.\n\n174\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.450\nAnd when you're just talking about one\nperson browsing to a website that's\n\n175\n00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:25.480\nnot a big deal.\n\n176\n00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.900\nBut when you're talking about\nsomething an Azure VPN here,\n\n177\n00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.890\nwhere I might have tons\nof replication data,\n\n178\n00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.240\ndatabase information syncing across,\nI might authentication traffic.\n\n179\n00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.800\nI want this to happen as fast as possible.\n\n180\n00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.510\nAnd I wanna be able to push as much\ntraffic over that link as I can and\n\n181\n00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.130\nnot get bogged down by\nencryption/decryption activities.\n\n182\n00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:52.120\nAnd so encryption and decryption using\ntwo different keys is more of a burden,\n\n183\n00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.100\nmore of a processor overhead than\nencryption/decryption with one key.\n\n184\n00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.870\nAnd so what we'll typically find is\nthat you use a combination of the two.\n\n185\n00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.050\nAll right, encryption and\n\n186\n00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.380\ndecryption with two keys,\nthat's called asymmetric encryption.\n\n187\n00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.780\nAsymmetric encryption is where you have\na private key and you generate a public\n\n188\n00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.950\nkey based on it, and people are encrypting\nand sending you data using that.\n\n189\n00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.330\nAnd then you can decrypt\nit using your private key.\n\n190\n00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.540\nYou might also have a second private key\nthat comes into the mix that becomes\n\n191\n00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.390\na hybrid environment, but let's put\nthat out of our mind for a second and\n\n192\n00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:29.780\njust look at it from the idea of, whoops.\n\n193\n00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:35.680\nI do not have a good mastery of my [LAUGH]\ntext today, what the heck am I doing?\n\n194\n00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.870\nSo anyhow,\napparently I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n195\n00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.250\nSo basically it looks like this.\n\n196\n00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.780\nWe have that private key.\n\n197\n00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.150\nWe generate a public key and\ntransmit it across the network.\n\n198\n00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.600\nOver here they can encrypt the data,\nsend to us and we can decrypt the data.\n\n199\n00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.950\nTwo different keys in the mix,\nthat's asymmetric.\n\n200\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.120\nIf I do symmetric it looks like this.\n\n201\n00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.090\nI've got a private key on both sides,\nthey're the same private key.\n\n202\n00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.940\nNow, I know Wes,\nhe's standing right here beside me.\n\n203\n00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.230\nI can give him my private\nkey on a USB key.\n\n204\n00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.280\nI can just put it on USB drive and\ngive it to him.\n\n205\n00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.870\nHere you go, Wes, here's my private key.\n\n206\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.900\nNow Wes can go anywhere in the world and\nhe can encrypt data and send it to me and\n\n207\n00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.630\nI can decrypt it and\nI can encrypt data and send it to him and\n\n208\n00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.030\nhe can decrypt because we\nboth have the private key and\n\n209\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.939\nI didn't send the private\nkey over the Internet.\n\n210\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:27.820\nSo if I sign up with Microsoft for\nAzure or I sign up with Amazon for\n\n211\n00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:33.300\nAWS or I sign up with Google Compute or\nRackspace or whoever, I could physically\n\n212\n00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.200\nput a private key on just some kind of\nphysical media and send it to them.\n\n213\n00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.840\nAnd they could load on their system,\n\n214\n00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.667\nthat private key didn't\nhave to cross the Internet.\n\n215\n00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:44.600\nAnd with a paid service you could do that,\nthey'll allow you to do it.\n\n216\n00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.620\nBut, if it's something like you're\nbrowsing the Amazon website and\n\n217\n00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.800\nyou wanna checkout securely, if a customer\ngoes to Amazon's website to buy soap,\n\n218\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.880\nthey want to soap right away.\n\n219\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.310\nThey don't wanna say, let me mail Amazon\nthis thumb drive that has my certificate.\n\n220\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.960\nIn a few days from now, they'll get it and\nload it in and then I can buy that soap.\n\n221\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.440\nThey need it to be instantaneous, right?\n\n222\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:12.970\nSo in that scenario, we don't have time to\nphysically and securely transmit that key.\n\n223\n00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.010\nSo instead we need to send\nthe key over the Internet,\n\n224\n00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:19.680\nbut we don't wanna do that in\na non-secure manner, right?\n\n225\n00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.250\nSo we've gotta come up with\nsome kind of better solution.\n\n226\n00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.400\nAnd what you normally have\nis a hybrid between these.\n\n227\n00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.500\nSo, when I have a public and private key,\nthat's called asymmetric encryption,\n\n228\n00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.590\none key to encrypt, one key to decrypt,\ntwo different keys.\n\n229\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:40.250\nWhen we talk about symmetric it's just one\nkey, one key used to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n230\n00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.460\nThis one gives us the best performance,\nright?\n\n231\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.930\nYou've only got one key to mess with.\n\n232\n00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.820\nThe math is a lot simpler for\nthe encryption algorithm and so\n\n233\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.780\nwe can push more data and\nget better performance.\n\n234\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.300\nThe trade-off is that we've got\nto transmit that private key.\n\n235\n00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:58.896\nIf we combine the two, which is what\nI had, whoops, that's different.\n\n236\n00:11:58.896 --> 00:12:03.430\nSo if we combine the two like this though,\nwe can get the best of both worlds, right?\n\n237\n00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:07.970\nWhen I generate a private key here\non my server, I can then generate\n\n238\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:12.500\na public key based on that, and I can\ntransmit the public key to the other side.\n\n239\n00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.660\nAnd at that point, the client and\nI can build up a secure tunnel,\n\n240\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.130\na tunnel between us that\nis encrypting data.\n\n241\n00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.240\nNot very efficient, cuz I got two\ndifferent keys, one encrypting,\n\n242\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.840\none decrypting, but the tunnel's in place.\n\n243\n00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:33.100\nOnce the tunnel's in place, then I can\ngenerate a session based private key,\n\n244\n00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.770\na private key just for this connection.\n\n245\n00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:40.675\nAnd I can send it over\nthe the tunnel that we just built.\n\n246\n00:12:40.675 --> 00:12:42.965\nI've got a secure tunnel between me and\nthem.\n\n247\n00:12:42.965 --> 00:12:47.385\nSo now I can send that private\nkey securely over the Internet.\n\n248\n00:12:47.385 --> 00:12:48.925\nIf somebody's intercepting traffic,\n\n249\n00:12:48.925 --> 00:12:51.230\nthe only thing they could have intercepted\nwas the public key that I sent.\n\n250\n00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.377\nThey're not gonna see anything else.\n\n251\n00:12:54.377 --> 00:12:57.797\nThey just see the encrypted data that\nthey can't decrypt with that public key.\n\n252\n00:12:57.797 --> 00:13:00.637\nAnd we then transmit that\nprivate key securely across it.\n\n253\n00:13:00.637 --> 00:13:03.507\n>> Now that would be something like I\nalways think of two keys on the lock box.\n\n254\n00:13:03.507 --> 00:13:05.367\nTwo, they say two keys on the launch pad.\n\n255\n00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:08.710\nWell, from the client's side, coming back\nto the server, that would almost be like\n\n256\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:14.100\nthem taking that second symmetric key,\nputting it in the lock box, closing it,\n\n257\n00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.290\ntaking your public key, and locking it,\nand then sending it back to you.\n\n258\n00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.940\nAnybody can intercept the public key, but\nthe only thing it can do is lock the box.\n\n259\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.410\nYou are the only one that has\nthe associated key that can actually\n\n260\n00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.260\nunlock the box.\n\n261\n00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.820\n>> Yep, and\nthat's exactly what's happening here.\n\n262\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.940\nSo we unlock it,\n\n263\n00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:33.860\nand now we've got a private key on both\nends that was securely transmitted.\n\n264\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.780\nAnd it was done instantaneously.\n\n265\n00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.870\nI didn't have to mail a USB key to them or\na CD drive, or whatever.\n\n266\n00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.990\nI didn't have to worry about that\nCD getting lost, or left behind,\n\n267\n00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.040\nthrown in the trash.\n\n268\n00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.420\nThis was securely transmitted and\nit can be time based.\n\n269\n00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.010\nAs soon as this session is over that key\ngets deleted and is no good anymore.\n\n270\n00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.350\nSo, I could be using new keys very,\nvery, very often.\n\n271\n00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:56.020\nIn fact, a lot of VPN tunnels will\nre-key themselves every 24 hours so\n\n272\n00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.040\nif they generate a key they'll use it for\na day and then they'll change the key.\n\n273\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.890\nImagine changing the passwords\nto your account every 24 hours.\n\n274\n00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.600\nIt'd be annoying as heck, it'd drive\nyou nuts, but you'd be very secure.\n\n275\n00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.510\nIf somebody intercepted your key it would\nonly be for a 24-hour period, right?\n\n276\n00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.050\nWell, VPN tunnels can do that,\nsecure connections can do that.\n\n277\n00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.870\nAnd so we're using a hybrid here.\n\n278\n00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:18.360\nWe're starting asymmetric\nto build a connection and\n\n279\n00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.180\nthen we're switching to symmetric\nto have the full communications.\n\n280\n00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:27.462\nAnd, at that point, I get the security of\nasymmetric for the initial tunnel, but\n\n281\n00:14:27.462 --> 00:14:31.324\nI get the performance of symmetric\nwhen I start transmitting my raw data.\n\n282\n00:14:31.324 --> 00:14:33.960\nAnd this is how a lot of\nVPN tunnels function.\n\n283\n00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.140\nThe challenge here is getting\nall this stuff to communicate.\n\n284\n00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.410\nHow does all this stuff work together and\nplay nice?\n\n285\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.590\nAnd there's two different systems we need\nto be familiar with to understand how\n\n286\n00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.610\nthat works.\n\n287\n00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.830\nThe first is what's called a PKI,\na public key infrastructure, and\n\n288\n00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.260\nthis is a terrible diagram.\n\n289\n00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.950\nI apologize for it, but it does\ncommunicate what I want to communicate\n\n290\n00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.550\nwhich is when we talk\nabout these certificates,\n\n291\n00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.140\nthese public keys,\nhow do I get a public key from somebody?\n\n292\n00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.980\nAnd how do I know that I can trust it?\n\n293\n00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.600\nHow doe that happen, right?\n\n294\n00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.690\nAnd there's gotta be a private key\ngenerated somewhere that the public key's\n\n295\n00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:05.900\ngenerated from.\n\n296\n00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.220\nHow does that work?\n\n297\n00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:12.060\nWell, a PKI is what does it, and\nPKI stands for public key infrastructure.\n\n298\n00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.510\nSo this the infrastructure,\n\n299\n00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.500\nthe systems that are required to get this\ntype of communication up and working.\n\n300\n00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.120\nAll right?\n\n301\n00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:24.115\nIt starts with what's called a CA,\na certificate authority.\n\n302\n00:15:24.115 --> 00:15:27.811\nA certificate authority is\na server that is going to act as\n\n303\n00:15:27.811 --> 00:15:30.700\nthat person that you trust, all right?\n\n304\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.100\nNow, who do you trust?\n\n305\n00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.132\nTrust no one, right, that's that saying.\n\n306\n00:15:34.132 --> 00:15:35.764\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But this whole thing breaks down if you\n\n307\n00:15:35.764 --> 00:15:36.600\ndon't trust somebody.\n\n308\n00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.050\nSo you've gotta trust somebody.\n\n309\n00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:43.340\nAnd that person is gonna be the person\nwho says yes, that public key is okay, or\n\n310\n00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.561\nno that public key is a fake, all right?\n\n311\n00:15:45.561 --> 00:15:47.823\nAnd this person you trust,\nit could be yourself.\n\n312\n00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:49.193\nMaybe you bring up your own CA.\n\n313\n00:15:49.193 --> 00:15:51.261\nYou can trust yourself, sometimes.\n\n314\n00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:54.606\nOr, maybe it's a public one, or\nmaybe it's a business partner,\n\n315\n00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:57.377\nsomebody that you do business with and\nyou trust them.\n\n316\n00:15:57.377 --> 00:16:00.510\nBut you gotta trust somebody.\n\n317\n00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.360\n>> Looking at this layout here,\nI think of, for instance,\n\n318\n00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.950\nmy driver's license, right?\n\n319\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.920\nIf I present my driver's license to a bank\nand I wanna get access to my resource,\n\n320\n00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.350\nwhich is my money,\nwell why is it the bank trusts my ID?\n\n321\n00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.300\nBecause they trust the authority\nthat issued the ID, right?\n\n322\n00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.080\nI'm sure we've got some military veterans\nout there or people in the military.\n\n323\n00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.400\nThe common access card, right?\n\n324\n00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.535\nWhen you present the common access card\nto let's say MP or you swipe it within\n\n325\n00:16:25.535 --> 00:16:30.485\na military base, why is it that the\nauthenticating device trusts the AC card?\n\n326\n00:16:30.485 --> 00:16:33.365\nBecause beforehand it trusts\nthe authority that issued that card\n\n327\n00:16:33.365 --> 00:16:34.945\njust like our driver's license, right?\n\n328\n00:16:34.945 --> 00:16:36.015\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n329\n00:16:36.015 --> 00:16:38.801\nAnd so, if I wanna use this, I've gotta\nstart with that person that I trust.\n\n330\n00:16:38.801 --> 00:16:41.245\nAnd let's just say it's third party.\n\n331\n00:16:41.245 --> 00:16:42.665\nLet's say we use DigiCert.\n\n332\n00:16:42.665 --> 00:16:43.415\nI like those guys.\n\n333\n00:16:43.415 --> 00:16:45.130\nSo we're gonna use DigiCert.\n\n334\n00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.895\nAnd so\nwhat I do is I would be the client here.\n\n335\n00:16:47.895 --> 00:16:51.180\nEven though this might be a server,\nI need to get a certificate.\n\n336\n00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.480\nSo we would generate\na certificate signing request.\n\n337\n00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.070\nWhat happens here is I actually\ngenerate my private key.\n\n338\n00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.280\nI make a private key.\n\n339\n00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.440\nAnd then I generate a signing request.\n\n340\n00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:07.590\nI need whoever is being trusted to sign\nmy certificate and say it's okay, right?\n\n341\n00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:08.970\nI have a private key.\n\n342\n00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:14.440\nAnd then I build a public key off\nof that with a signing request and\n\n343\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.750\nI send it up to the CA.\n\n344\n00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.810\nNow it might go to the primary CA,\nbut normally those are disconnected,\n\n345\n00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.450\nseparate from the network and secure.\n\n346\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.320\nSo normally you're submitting to\nwhat's called subordinate CA, right,\n\n347\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.660\njust kind of a secondary\ncertificate authority.\n\n348\n00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.920\nAnd they take that certificate\nsigning request, and\n\n349\n00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.550\nthey verify that I am who I say I am.\n\n350\n00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.480\nMaybe they give me a phone call,\nmake you submit some banking documents,\n\n351\n00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.200\nyou have to prove your identity.\n\n352\n00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.330\nAnd once you've proven it, they sign it.\n\n353\n00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.500\nAnd then they send you\na signed certificate.\n\n354\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.570\nAnd the signed certificate is actually\nyour public certificate that's signed,\n\n355\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:43.600\nyour public key.\n\n356\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.760\nAnd so now we can load that on our server,\n\n357\n00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.300\nand when people connect to us,\nwe give them the public certificate.\n\n358\n00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.000\nAnd they say how do I know this\npublic certificate is good?\n\n359\n00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.680\nThey can go and check with whoever\nissued it, whoever the CA is.\n\n360\n00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.250\nIf they trust that CA also they\ncan check it, and the certificate\n\n361\n00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.330\nrevocation list they can look at to see\nis the certificate good or is it bad.\n\n362\n00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.220\nIs it expired?\n\n363\n00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.250\nHas it been revoked?\n\n364\n00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.250\nWhat's going on?\n\n365\n00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.680\nBut if it's good, they can now\nencrypt data and send it to me.\n\n366\n00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.260\nI've got the private key to decrypt it.\n\n367\n00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.010\nThe private key never crosses the network.\n\n368\n00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.040\nAll these pieces fall into place.\n\n369\n00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.130\nIf we use a public authority like\nDigiCert, they provide the primary CA,\n\n370\n00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.730\nthey provide the subordinate CAs and they\nprovide the certificate ratification list.\n\n371\n00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.870\nIf you decide to build this yourself,\nthese are all components you need.\n\n372\n00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:27.860\nYou're gonna have to build these.\n\n373\n00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.100\nYou're gonna have to have server\ninfrastructure to support it.\n\n374\n00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.460\nAnd you're going to have to\ntrust your infrastructure.\n\n375\n00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.753\nAnd whoever your customers are,\n\n376\n00:18:33.753 --> 00:18:35.886\nare going to have to support\nthat infrastructure too.\n\n377\n00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:38.870\nThey're going to have to trust your CA,\nwhich they may not.\n\n378\n00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:42.503\nSo, if I'm trying to build up\na VPN tunnel to Microsoft,\n\n379\n00:18:42.503 --> 00:18:47.368\nyou know that Microsoft is not going to\ntrust your CA, if you build your own.\n\n380\n00:18:47.368 --> 00:18:49.560\nYou're going to have to use a public one.\n\n381\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.170\nOr you're going to have\nto use private keys,\n\n382\n00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.630\nwhere you manually place\nthe private key on both sides.\n\n383\n00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.590\nAnd you can do that when you build up\na VPN and you put that private key in and\n\n384\n00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.270\nit doesn't make them trust at that point.\n\n385\n00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.360\nIt just you got the same key\non both sides and off it goes.\n\n386\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.328\nYou'll find a lot of people instead of\nusing a certificate will use what's called\n\n387\n00:19:09.328 --> 00:19:11.128\nthe PSK, a pre-shared key.\n\n388\n00:19:11.128 --> 00:19:13.682\nAnd a pre-shared key is\nreally just a password,\n\n389\n00:19:13.682 --> 00:19:17.555\na password you put in on both sides,\nso you can avoid having the whole PKI.\n\n390\n00:19:17.555 --> 00:19:21.150\nOkay, you can avoid having all this extra\ninfrastructure, you just have a password.\n\n391\n00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.614\nBut if you do a password,\nthey're hard to revoke.\n\n392\n00:19:23.614 --> 00:19:26.630\nYou've got to go in and manually change\nit on both systems to change it.\n\n393\n00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.490\nWhereas a certificate, I could revoke\ninstantly by adding it to the CRL, right.\n\n394\n00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.050\nSo certificates give you a lot\nmore granularity control.\n\n395\n00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.785\n>> Don, you mentioned that\npre-shared key concept there.\n\n396\n00:19:35.785 --> 00:19:39.352\nNow when you were pointing out symmetric\nkey encryption you had mentioned that for\n\n397\n00:19:39.352 --> 00:19:42.244\ninstance, me as an example,\nthat you could put that key on a USB and\n\n398\n00:19:42.244 --> 00:19:43.690\nyou could hand it to me.\n\n399\n00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.440\nOr if we needed it a little bit\n\n400\n00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.760\nmore instantaneous we could do this on\nthe cloud through the provider itself.\n\n401\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.370\nWould that be an example of\na pre-shared key as well?\n\n402\n00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:53.867\n>> Yeah, I mean, it can be.\n\n403\n00:19:53.867 --> 00:19:57.120\nIf it's done dynamically in that instance,\nit's not pre-shared.\n\n404\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.404\nYou're sharing it right at that moment and\nso that's almost always certificate based.\n\n405\n00:20:00.404 --> 00:20:03.652\nCuz if you're just sharing the password\nright there in that moment,\n\n406\n00:20:03.652 --> 00:20:06.790\nthen technically anybody could\nconnect up and get a password and-\n\n407\n00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.741\n>> Gotcha, not quite the same.\n\n408\n00:20:08.741 --> 00:20:09.995\n>> Yep, yep.\n\n409\n00:20:09.995 --> 00:20:12.260\nAll right now, but\nyou mentioned that handoff, right?\n\n410\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.407\nWhen we connect up, like when you\nbuild one of these Azure VPNs or\n\n411\n00:20:15.407 --> 00:20:18.613\na VPN to Amazon web servers,\na VPN to anywhere really, when those\n\n412\n00:20:18.613 --> 00:20:22.521\ntwo firewalls connect, when those two\nrouters or whatever they are, when they\n\n413\n00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:26.767\nconnect to build up that tunnel, they have\nto negotiate on what they're going to do.\n\n414\n00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:28.357\nWhat type of encryption\nthey're going to do,\n\n415\n00:20:28.357 --> 00:20:31.151\nhow they're going to hand off the keys,\nall of this stuff has to get negotiated.\n\n416\n00:20:31.151 --> 00:20:36.372\nAnd one of the best ways to do that is\nthrough using the IPSec Framework, rigght.\n\n417\n00:20:36.372 --> 00:20:40.843\nThe IPsec or Internet Protocol Security\nFramework is a standard that darn\n\n418\n00:20:40.843 --> 00:20:44.030\nnear every system out there\non the planet supports.\n\n419\n00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.260\nYou can use it for VPN tunnels or\n\n420\n00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.740\neven just secure communications\nbetween clients.\n\n421\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:52.330\nIt's natively built into IPv6 but\non IPv4, we can snap it right on and\n\n422\n00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.200\nyou can secure your communications.\n\n423\n00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.070\nAnd what IPSec does is it provides\nconfidentiality, integrity,\n\n424\n00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.120\nauthentication and\na key exchange mechanism.\n\n425\n00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.520\nSo when two hosts connect to each other,\nor\n\n426\n00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.620\na client and host connect, they can say,\nhey I'm running IPSec, are you?\n\n427\n00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.720\nYou are, great.\n\n428\n00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.600\nLet's negotiate out these four things.\n\n429\n00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.300\nWe'll start with confidentiality.\n\n430\n00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.450\nI need to make sure data I send\nto you is only readable by you.\n\n431\n00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.110\nSo do how do we want to encrypt the data?\n\n432\n00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.660\nDo I wanna do DES,\ntriple DES, or AES, right?\n\n433\n00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.950\nOr maybe I don't wanna\nencrypt the data at all.\n\n434\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:30.830\nYou'll see up here for IPSec, you actually\nhave a few different forms of processing.\n\n435\n00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.772\nYou have what's called Or\nauthentication hatter.\n\n436\n00:21:33.772 --> 00:21:35.978\nSays that we digitally\nsign each packet and\n\n437\n00:21:35.978 --> 00:21:40.340\nthat way when the other side receives the\npacket, it can see if it's been tampered.\n\n438\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.711\nIf it's been tampered with,\nthe signature fails and so\n\n439\n00:21:42.711 --> 00:21:44.180\nwe know it's been tampered with.\n\n440\n00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.690\nIf we just wanna make sure our\ndata doesn't get tampered with,\n\n441\n00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.550\nwe just need We don't need\nto encrypt at all, right?\n\n442\n00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.690\nYou're just creating digital\nsignatures based on integrity,\n\n443\n00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:53.960\nbased on hashing algorithm.\n\n444\n00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:59.560\nAnd MD5, message digest 5, or S-H-A, SHA,\nwhich is the secure hashing algorithm,\n\n445\n00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.910\nthose are the two most\ncommon forms of integrity.\n\n446\n00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.670\nJust uses integrity.\n\n447\n00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.540\nThen you got ESP, which is\nthe encapsulating security payload.\n\n448\n00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.980\nAnd what it does is says\nwe're gonna encrypt the data,\n\n449\n00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.610\nwe don't want anybody to read it.\n\n450\n00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.740\nWith People can still read your data,\nthey just can't tamper with it.\n\n451\n00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.280\nWith ESP it's encrypted.\n\n452\n00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.370\nAnd for that,\nthat's where we get our confidentiality.\n\n453\n00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.360\nAnd you'll see DES, triple DES, AES,\n\n454\n00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.650\nprotocols like that in there, right,\nbut most of the time we do both.\n\n455\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.440\nESP plus.\n\n456\n00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.350\nWe do encryption, and\nauthentication enter.\n\n457\n00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.310\nWe want to encrypt and digitally sign so\n\n458\n00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.740\nwe make sure we have confidentiality and\nintegrity.\n\n459\n00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.490\nBut when you do that,\nyou've got to pick between your protocols.\n\n460\n00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.789\nYou've got to pick between your hashing\nalgorithms and your encryption algorithms\n\n461\n00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:45.449\nand there's a bunch of different\nones that are available, right.\n\n462\n00:22:45.449 --> 00:22:48.070\nAnd I'll show you some\nhere in just a moment.\n\n463\n00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.850\nAfter that, you've gotta pick how\nyou want to authenticate, right?\n\n464\n00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.140\nIf we're using certificates,\nyou're using RSA for authentication.\n\n465\n00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:58.730\nIf you're using a pre-shared key, you're\nusing PSK, right, a password instead.\n\n466\n00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.590\nSo here's where we're determining\nwhether we're gonna do that,\n\n467\n00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:02.050\ncertificate or password.\n\n468\n00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.150\nAnd then after that,\nhow do we do our key exchange?\n\n469\n00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.220\nAnd there's really only one commonly\nsupported key exchange right now,\n\n470\n00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.036\nwhich is the Diffie-Hellman process,\nthat Wes mentioned a moment ago.\n\n471\n00:23:11.036 --> 00:23:16.620\nAnd there's Diffie-Hellman 1, 2,\n5, then I think it jumps to 14 and\n\n472\n00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.970\n28, it goes higher from there.\n\n473\n00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:24.200\nBut these are basically different levels\nof key exchange, and you just have to\n\n474\n00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.230\ndetermine what level you're gonna run at\nwhen you communicate to that other side.\n\n475\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:31.150\nSo all of these are things that have to\nbe decided when that tunnel comes up.\n\n476\n00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.310\nYou can manually set all these and\nthen you don't need IPSec.\n\n477\n00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.124\nBut what IPSec does is it lets\ntwo nodes connect and negotiate.\n\n478\n00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:39.744\nBecause I might support more than\none encryption algorithm and\n\n479\n00:23:39.744 --> 00:23:42.190\nI might support more than\none hashing algorithm.\n\n480\n00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:43.500\nThe two sides can negotiate out and\n\n481\n00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.970\npick the strongest one that both\nof them support if you want.\n\n482\n00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:47.140\nIPSec allows that.\n\n483\n00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.661\nIt creates a lot of flexibility.\n\n484\n00:23:48.661 --> 00:23:54.149\n>> One of the things I like about the\nDiffie-Hellman algorithm there is the fact\n\n485\n00:23:54.149 --> 00:24:00.145\nthat two computers that have never talked\nbefore Can share information publicly and\n\n486\n00:24:00.145 --> 00:24:05.128\narrive at a secret that, you never\nsay impossible but is improbable,\n\n487\n00:24:05.128 --> 00:24:10.380\nthat the secret can be recreated and\nit's all over a public wire.\n\n488\n00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.710\n>> Yeah, absolutely and\nit's all very trustworthy.\n\n489\n00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.400\nIt is a neat system.\n\n490\n00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.510\nMost of the stuff was\ndeveloped back in the 70s.\n\n491\n00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.210\nIn fact, let me bring up this other,\nI've got an Excel spreadsheet, I know,\n\n492\n00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.670\nit's Excel in a tech show,\nI'm breaking some kind of tech rule here.\n\n493\n00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.392\n[LAUGH] But we made this spreadsheet for\nour CISSP show,\n\n494\n00:24:25.392 --> 00:24:29.239\nwhere it's just basically all the\ndifferent algorithms that are out there,\n\n495\n00:24:29.239 --> 00:24:32.874\nnot all of them, but the popular ones,\nand kind of what they do, right.\n\n496\n00:24:32.874 --> 00:24:36.500\nAre they used for asymmetric or symmetric?\n\n497\n00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.013\nAre they hashing algorithms, right?\n\n498\n00:24:38.013 --> 00:24:41.288\nYou have asymmetric and symmetric,\nwe're talking about encryption there, but\n\n499\n00:24:41.288 --> 00:24:45.120\nhashing, we're just talking about data\nintegrity, right, digital signatures.\n\n500\n00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.810\nSo I've kinda got that flagged over here.\n\n501\n00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.960\nSome of them you'll see can be used for\nencryption as well as digital signatures.\n\n502\n00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.160\nIt can be used for both.\n\n503\n00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.700\nSome are just used for\nhashing, some can be used for\n\n504\n00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.680\nkey distribution, so like on the key\nexchanges, it can run on top of them.\n\n505\n00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.590\nThere's a lot of flexibility out there.\n\n506\n00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:04.860\nAnd so when you set up a tunnel or\nany kind of encryption on your system,\n\n507\n00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.380\nyou'll have to choose between these,\nright?\n\n508\n00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:11.471\nAnd some of them are really,\nreally common, like 3DES.\n\n509\n00:25:11.471 --> 00:25:15.977\n3DES is used all over the place,\nversus other ones like TwoFish,\n\n510\n00:25:15.977 --> 00:25:18.080\nwhich is not used as commonly.\n\n511\n00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.873\nIn fact, a lot of people might not\nhave even heard of it, right, but\n\n512\n00:25:20.873 --> 00:25:21.700\nit is out there.\n\n513\n00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.980\nSAFER is another one that's\njust not terribly popular yet.\n\n514\n00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.060\nAnd the reason is,\nwhen a new encryption algorithm comes out,\n\n515\n00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.940\npeople don't flock to it right away.\n\n516\n00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.710\nThey usually let it cook for a few years\n\n517\n00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.390\nwhile they give security researchers time\nto see if they can find holes in it.\n\n518\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:40.960\nIt takes a long time for the security\nindustry to trust a new protocol.\n\n519\n00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.400\n>> The security concept of using proven\ntechnology, not just jumping in.\n\n520\n00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.914\nI know you've probably talked\nabout this in other Linux shows.\n\n521\n00:25:47.914 --> 00:25:51.641\nThat's one of the things that separates\nRedhat from some of the other distros that\n\n522\n00:25:51.641 --> 00:25:53.760\nare out there,\nbecause it's tried and true.\n\n523\n00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.720\nIt's been used before, right?\n\n524\n00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.450\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n525\n00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:00.510\nAnd when you look at some of\nthese like AES, AES is probably\n\n526\n00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:06.065\nthe most common trusted encryption\nalgorithm that's still out there today.\n\n527\n00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:08.946\nIt was originally created in 1998.\n\n528\n00:26:08.946 --> 00:26:12.057\nSo, 1998, I mean we're talking about,\nwhat, 18 years ago?\n\n529\n00:26:12.057 --> 00:26:12.614\n>> Wow.\n\n530\n00:26:12.614 --> 00:26:13.589\n>> Is my math good there?\n\n531\n00:26:13.589 --> 00:26:14.448\nYeah, 18 years ago.\n\n532\n00:26:14.448 --> 00:26:15.818\n>> That's scary.\n>> It's very old.\n\n533\n00:26:15.818 --> 00:26:18.300\nAnd so I know what you're thinking,\nit's old.\n\n534\n00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.430\nWhy am I still using old encryption?\n\n535\n00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.760\nWell, it's very good and\nit hasn't been broken.\n\n536\n00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.720\nAnd it's not to say that it's\nrunning today the same way that it\n\n537\n00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.090\ndid 18 years ago, right.\n\n538\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:32.720\nSo originally, AES might have only\nbeen using 64 bit encryption, right,\n\n539\n00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.440\na 64 bit key, but now it's very\ncommon to use it with a 256 bit key.\n\n540\n00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.900\nAnd back in the day we didn't have\nthe processing power to do that, but\n\n541\n00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.000\ntoday we do.\n\n542\n00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.420\nAnd so they keep increasing\nthe bit strength of the protocol.\n\n543\n00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.170\nAnd it's still secure and\nit can't be broken.\n\n544\n00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:48.310\nSome of them have been broken.\n\n545\n00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:51.266\nRC4 has been broken,\nyou shouldn't be using RC4 anywhere.\n\n546\n00:26:51.266 --> 00:26:56.950\nBut RC5 is still considered safe,\nas long as your key is 64 bits or longer.\n\n547\n00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:00.090\nIf your key is under 64 bits,\nit's been compromised.\n\n548\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.405\nSo that happens,\nas CPU power increases in computers,\n\n549\n00:27:03.405 --> 00:27:08.230\nthe ability to break into this stuff\nbecomes a lot more possible, right.\n\n550\n00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:13.560\nSo we need to understand that when we pick\nthese, that I know 3DES is really popular.\n\n551\n00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.410\nIt's really common out there.\n\n552\n00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.430\nDES was originally developed\nback in the 70s and\n\n553\n00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.310\n3DES is just taking DES, what is DES?\n\n554\n00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.011\nDigital encryption-\n>> Data encryption standard.\n\n555\n00:27:23.011 --> 00:27:25.900\n>> Data encryption standard,\nthere we go, thank you.\n\n556\n00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.330\nWhat you do is DES is old and broken.\n\n557\n00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.550\nAnd they said, what if we just take data,\nand we encrypt it once with DES, and then\n\n558\n00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.520\nwe encrypt it a second time with DES, and\nthen we encrypt it a third time with DES?\n\n559\n00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.158\nSo you're doing three\nlevels of encryption,\n\n560\n00:27:37.158 --> 00:27:41.433\nwhich effectively takes what was a,\nit was like a 54 bit key originally?\n\n561\n00:27:41.433 --> 00:27:42.222\n>> Yes, I believe that's right.\n\n562\n00:27:42.222 --> 00:27:46.490\n>> And each time you run it, it increases\nwhat the effective key size would be.\n\n563\n00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.640\nAnd you end up something,\ndid I put that in the notes?\n\n564\n00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.760\nI can never remember this one.\n\n565\n00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.165\nYou end up with 168 bit key size on\nit by running it three times, and\n\n566\n00:27:53.165 --> 00:27:56.893\nthat was great for a long time, but\neven that's got some weaknesses in it.\n\n567\n00:27:56.893 --> 00:28:01.950\nAnd we're starting to see with modern CPU\npowers become realistic to break 3DES.\n\n568\n00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.955\nSo it's not as secure as it used to be,\nall right.\n\n569\n00:28:04.955 --> 00:28:07.845\nNow, you need to know a handful\nof these in the exam, and\n\n570\n00:28:07.845 --> 00:28:09.405\nI've got them in the Show Notes for you.\n\n571\n00:28:09.405 --> 00:28:12.635\nAnd just to put a little\nof history to each one,\n\n572\n00:28:12.635 --> 00:28:14.215\nas far as the date they came out.\n\n573\n00:28:14.215 --> 00:28:17.632\nSo you can get an idea of which ones\nare older, and which ones are newer.\n\n574\n00:28:17.632 --> 00:28:18.922\nAnd the key strength on them.\n\n575\n00:28:18.922 --> 00:28:20.012\nCuz what you really need to know for\n\n576\n00:28:20.012 --> 00:28:23.332\nthe exam is which ones\nare stronger than the others.\n\n577\n00:28:23.332 --> 00:28:25.522\nAnd they don't call all\nthese out here on the slide.\n\n578\n00:28:25.522 --> 00:28:28.142\nIn the show notes I put just\nthe ones that you need to know.\n\n579\n00:28:28.142 --> 00:28:30.526\nSo let's just run through\nthem really quickly.\n\n580\n00:28:30.526 --> 00:28:33.606\nThere's AES,\nwhich I kinda see from that a moment ago.\n\n581\n00:28:33.606 --> 00:28:37.274\nAES, it just stands for\nAdvanced Encryption Standard.\n\n582\n00:28:37.274 --> 00:28:39.014\nIt came out in 1998.\n\n583\n00:28:39.014 --> 00:28:41.323\nIt's got up to a 256-bit key strength and\n\n584\n00:28:41.323 --> 00:28:44.866\nit's really one of the most common\nones that we're gonna use today.\n\n585\n00:28:44.866 --> 00:28:47.891\nWe've got 3DES, it came out also in 1998.\n\n586\n00:28:47.891 --> 00:28:52.567\nThere was an encryption contest in 1998\nto create a protocol called AES, and\n\n587\n00:28:52.567 --> 00:28:56.074\nthe one that is called AES was\noriginally called Rijndael but\n\n588\n00:28:56.074 --> 00:29:00.025\nit's the one that won the contest and\nso it's now called AES.\n\n589\n00:29:00.025 --> 00:29:03.160\n3DES was submitted, it didn't win,\nbut it still got released.\n\n590\n00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.693\n>> Couple other ones you've got on\nthe slide up there, Blowfish and\n\n591\n00:29:05.693 --> 00:29:08.656\nTwoFish by Bruce Schneier were also\nin that competition, and they failed.\n\n592\n00:29:08.656 --> 00:29:10.580\n>> Failed.\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n593\n00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.680\n>> We shouldn't say they failed.\n\n594\n00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.960\n>> Well, they didn't fail cuz they're\nstill used, you still use them.\n\n595\n00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.349\n>> Yeah and they're good protocols,\n\n596\n00:29:15.349 --> 00:29:18.370\nthey just weren't accepted as that one\nthat was going to be the one promoted.\n\n597\n00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.830\nSo that's why you'll see so\nmany of these that came out in 1998.\n\n598\n00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.538\nBut there's ones like RSA,\nwhich I've got on here somewhere,\n\n599\n00:29:24.538 --> 00:29:26.560\nway up here at the top, right.\n\n600\n00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.485\nRSA, which is named after three people.\n\n601\n00:29:28.485 --> 00:29:29.669\nWes, you always remember the people.\n\n602\n00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:34.661\n>> Ron Rivest, Shamir and Adleman.\n\n603\n00:29:34.661 --> 00:29:38.417\nI don't know how to say Shamir,\nbut I probably murdered his name,\n\n604\n00:29:38.417 --> 00:29:39.435\nsorry out there.\n\n605\n00:29:39.435 --> 00:29:41.855\n>> So yeah, those are the three\npeople that came up with that one.\n\n606\n00:29:41.855 --> 00:29:43.779\nIt was two security researchers,\nand one mathematician.\n\n607\n00:29:43.779 --> 00:29:48.004\nAnd they created this great\nprotocol back in 1977.\n\n608\n00:29:48.004 --> 00:29:49.680\n>> Same year that Marty Helman and\n\n609\n00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.230\nWhitfield Diffie came out with\nthe Diffie-Hellman Algorithm.\n\n610\n00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.312\nIt was later in that same year, 1977.\n\n611\n00:29:55.312 --> 00:29:57.580\n>> Yeah, so\na lot of this stuff's been around awhile.\n\n612\n00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.600\nRC4, I mentioned, which had been\ncompromised, that one came out in 1987,\n\n613\n00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.310\nand, again, shouldn't be used anywhere,\n\n614\n00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:09.140\nreplaced by RC5 in 1994 and\nRC5 is still used today.\n\n615\n00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.416\nIf you go to a web site\nthat's using SSL encryption,\n\n616\n00:30:11.416 --> 00:30:13.553\nthe odds are it's using\nsome variation of RC5.\n\n617\n00:30:13.553 --> 00:30:16.343\nYou'll still see that very commonly and\n\n618\n00:30:16.343 --> 00:30:20.150\npeople are starting to move\naway from that over to AES.\n\n619\n00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:24.520\n>> And some of the flaws of the RC4 was\nthe fact that it was a relatively weak\n\n620\n00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.540\nstream cipher.\n\n621\n00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:30.220\nAnd it formed even the basis in WEP,\nthe wired equivalent privacy as well.\n\n622\n00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:36.840\nRC5 is a variable block cipher,\nso a little bit stronger, right.\n\n623\n00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.980\n>> Now,\na key principle that I wanna mention,\n\n624\n00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.070\nthat's really all I wanna run through\nas far as the algorithms themselves.\n\n625\n00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.660\nAgain, I put them in the show notes for\nyou guys.\n\n626\n00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.529\nYou can study over them, you just need to\nknow which ones are stronger than other\n\n627\n00:30:47.529 --> 00:30:51.543\nones, and kind of that, what's newer and\nbetter, what's older and outdated.\n\n628\n00:30:51.543 --> 00:30:55.138\nThe other thing to remember is\nwhere we apply these things, right.\n\n629\n00:30:55.138 --> 00:30:57.560\nI keep using the example of a VPN,\nwhere's my VPN diagram?\n\n630\n00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.020\nSo I keep talking about a VPN.\n\n631\n00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.220\nThat's what called data in motion right?\n\n632\n00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.850\nData in motion is when data\nis transiting your network,\n\n633\n00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:09.300\ndata moving from one server to another.\n\n634\n00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.070\nNow that's normally what\nwe're worried about.\n\n635\n00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:16.010\nI worry about data in motion because\neverybody is out there on the Internet,\n\n636\n00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:17.430\ngood guys and bad guys.\n\n637\n00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:18.733\nI can't control the Internet.\n\n638\n00:31:18.733 --> 00:31:22.840\nSo when I have data crossing the Internet,\nI worry about it, data in motion.\n\n639\n00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.752\nAnd so\na lot of these encryption algorithms,\n\n640\n00:31:24.752 --> 00:31:27.390\nthat's where we're applying them,\nlike with VPN tunnels.\n\n641\n00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.660\nBut you also have data at rest.\n\n642\n00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.750\nData at rest is, once the data crosses\nthe network, it get to a server and\n\n643\n00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:35.780\nit sits there.\n\n644\n00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.990\nSo if my data is sitting up here in Azure,\nand it's crossed the VPN tunnel,\n\n645\n00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:44.290\nit comes up and now it's up here on\nthe hard drive in this server, right?\n\n646\n00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:48.110\nWhat happens if a hacker\nbreaks into this server?\n\n647\n00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:51.600\nWell the data was encrypted while it was\nin motion coming over the VPN tunnel, but\n\n648\n00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.820\nthat doesn't help me one single\nbit on the server itself.\n\n649\n00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:00.010\nAnd so once the data makes it to its\ndestination, or even at its origin,\n\n650\n00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:03.170\nwhere the data is coming from,\nthe data is on a hard drive.\n\n651\n00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:04.780\nAnd that's called data at rest.\n\n652\n00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.090\nIt's just data sitting there.\n\n653\n00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.330\nAnd we need to secure it there too.\n\n654\n00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:13.520\nAnd so oftentimes we use VPN tunnels to\nencrypt data in motion across the network.\n\n655\n00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.780\nAnd then we'll use storage\nsecurity technologies to\n\n656\n00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.040\nsecure the data right there.\n\n657\n00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.980\nAnd I know we're low on time this episode,\nso we're gonna have an episode just on\n\n658\n00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.377\nstorage security to kinda cover\nsome of the ways that that works.\n\n659\n00:32:24.377 --> 00:32:28.624\nBut always remember that you've got to\nencrypt your data, you've gotta secure\n\n660\n00:32:28.624 --> 00:32:32.754\nyour data and treat it sensitively when\nit's in motion and when it's at rest.\n\n661\n00:32:32.754 --> 00:32:34.064\nAnd I'm not just making those words up.\n\n662\n00:32:34.064 --> 00:32:35.930\nThose are official security terms.\n\n663\n00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.910\nData in motion, data at rest,\nyou'll see them on the exam.\n\n664\n00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.873\n>> And I noticed that there's two\nsides of the tunnel there, so\n\n665\n00:32:41.873 --> 00:32:45.651\nthe way we secure it in our network\non-premise could be completely different\n\n666\n00:32:45.651 --> 00:32:48.806\naccording to some SLA on how they\nstore it securely in the cloud.\n\n667\n00:32:48.806 --> 00:32:53.084\nSo you'll have to pay attention to VSLAs\nand really research how they're doing,\n\n668\n00:32:53.084 --> 00:32:57.780\nto make sure if you've got any compliance\nlegalities that, well, you follow them.\n\n669\n00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.083\n>> Absolutely, yep, it's all a part of it,\nand then not just on your servers, but\n\n670\n00:33:01.083 --> 00:33:02.310\nin your infrastructure too.\n\n671\n00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.814\nIf I've got a SAN behind all this,\na storage area network, and\n\n672\n00:33:04.814 --> 00:33:07.280\nwe've got security technologies\nto implement there, too.\n\n673\n00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.783\nBecause a hacker, if they had physical\naccess to your server room, right,\n\n674\n00:33:10.783 --> 00:33:14.505\nif it was an insider job, they might just\nskip right past your servers and go right\n\n675\n00:33:14.505 --> 00:33:17.980\nto the SAN and plug in there and start\nto attack on the storage area network.\n\n676\n00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.348\nNow they bypassed all that great\nstuff you did on the servers.\n\n677\n00:33:20.348 --> 00:33:22.337\nSo we've gotta make sure\nthat data's protected,\n\n678\n00:33:22.337 --> 00:33:24.800\nand we'll see there's various\ntechnologies for doing that.\n\n679\n00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.950\n>> Great information, Don.\n\n680\n00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.890\nAnd I'll tell you what,\nthis has been a fun episode.\n\n681\n00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:31.314\nWhen you talk security, you talk\nencryption, we wanna see how can we\n\n682\n00:33:31.314 --> 00:33:34.930\nstop the bad guys or at least try to\nmitigate some of the risk behind that?\n\n683\n00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:36.350\nSo, great information.\n\n684\n00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.250\nRemember we talked about encryption.\n\n685\n00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:42.278\nWe talked about some of the different\ntypes of encryptions you can see,\n\n686\n00:33:42.278 --> 00:33:44.110\nasymmetric versus symmetric.\n\n687\n00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.240\nDo we have two keys?\n\n688\n00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.570\nDo we have a single key?\n\n689\n00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:47.560\nSo all good information.\n\n690\n00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.240\nThank you for that Don.\n\n691\n00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.530\nDon, you got anything else for us?\n\n692\n00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:50.960\n>> I think that's about it for this one.\n\n693\n00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.209\nDo remember if you're watching this\non a Roku or iOS device or whatever,\n\n694\n00:33:54.209 --> 00:33:56.993\nyou might not see them, but\ndefinitely swing by our website.\n\n695\n00:33:56.993 --> 00:34:00.339\nBecause the show notes for this episode\nwill have each of the protocols you need\n\n696\n00:34:00.339 --> 00:34:03.176\nto know for the exam, and just two or\nthree little bullet points for\n\n697\n00:34:03.176 --> 00:34:06.031\neach one that you'll wanna remember\nto be able to tell them apart.\n\n698\n00:34:06.031 --> 00:34:08.353\n>> All right, very good and\ngreat information, Don.\n\n699\n00:34:08.353 --> 00:34:10.630\nThanks for that.\nYou guys check those notes out.\n\n700\n00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:15.320\nLooks like we've come to the end of\nanother exciting episode here at ITProTV,\n\n701\n00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.740\nso we're gonna go ahead and sign off here.\n\n702\n00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.251\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n703\n00:34:18.251 --> 00:34:19.064\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n704\n00:34:19.064 --> 00:34:21.502\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n705\n00:34:21.502 --> 00:34:26.915\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.728\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.728 --> 00:00:20.130\ntoday's episode we're gonna be\nmoving along in our Cloud+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.795\nSpecifically, what we're gonna be\nlooking at today is Storage security.\n\n6\n00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:28.785\nWe've been talking a lot about how when\nthe data's moving across the public\n\n7\n00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:31.120\nnetwork, pretty much the Internet.\n\n8\n00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.870\nHow we can encrypt that information, and\nmake sure that the eavesdroppers out there\n\n9\n00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.730\nthat are trying to look at our data,\ndon't have access.\n\n10\n00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.270\nBut what happens to that data\nonce it reaches those end points?\n\n11\n00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.569\nWell, that's what we're gonna be\ndiscussing here in this episode.\n\n12\n00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:45.774\nWell, we got none other then\nDon Pezet here to help us out.\n\n13\n00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:46.680\nDon, how are you doing?\n\n14\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.782\n>> I am doing great, Wes.\n\n15\n00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:50.337\nReady to jump right back into\nvirtualization security.\n\n16\n00:00:50.337 --> 00:00:54.308\nIn the last episode we got a chance to\ntalk a little bit about data encryption,\n\n17\n00:00:54.308 --> 00:00:57.013\nand how we can secure our data and\nstore it securely.\n\n18\n00:00:57.013 --> 00:01:01.300\nAnd we talked about data in motion,\nand data at rest.\n\n19\n00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.560\nAnd in this episode,\nit's all about data at rest.\n\n20\n00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.260\nWhen you have your data\nstored on a hard drive or\n\n21\n00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.690\non a SAN, we've gotta secure that.\n\n22\n00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.880\nNow, your attackers,\nyour people coming in over the Internet,\n\n23\n00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.118\nthey're not really effected by data at\nrest or the way you encrypt that data.\n\n24\n00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:22.190\nWhat data at rest is really concerned\nwith is somebody with physical access.\n\n25\n00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.010\nSomebody internal,\n\n26\n00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.450\nsomebody inside your organization\nthat's trying to get at this data.\n\n27\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.942\nThere was a big thing a long time ago now.\n\n28\n00:01:28.942 --> 00:01:34.021\nProbably 15 years ago at the, was it the\nLos Alamos Nuclear Research Facility or\n\n29\n00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:38.100\nwhatever, where they had a very\nsecure facility in place.\n\n30\n00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.800\nAnd somebody actually just stole\nthe hard drives right out of a computer.\n\n31\n00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.000\nI don't care about a password,\nthe log in, or whatever.\n\n32\n00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.110\nLet's just deal with hard drives.\n\n33\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.970\nAnd the drives might not even\nbe encrypted at that point.\n\n34\n00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.670\nBut when you take those hard drives,\nand you leave the building and\n\n35\n00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.660\nyou have them, you can now take\nall the time in the world.\n\n36\n00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.613\nYou want to try and decrypt that data,\nand interpret what's on there.\n\n37\n00:01:56.613 --> 00:01:59.863\nAnd we've gotta do whatever we\ncan to make it not possible.\n\n38\n00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:02.311\nSo that if somebody does steal\nthose physical hard drives and\n\n39\n00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:04.430\nrun out of your building\nthat you can just kick back.\n\n40\n00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.808\nAnd say, all right, well,\nI'll just buy some new hard drives, and\n\n41\n00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:09.380\nnot be worried about your data cuz\nyou know it's safe and secure.\n\n42\n00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.559\nSo, securing our data at rest is a couple\nof different pieces of that puzzle that we\n\n43\n00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.430\nneed to look at, and we're gonna look\nat them right here on this episode.\n\n44\n00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.940\n>> Same thing happened a few\nyears back to an external CA,\n\n45\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.873\ncertificate authority called DigiNotar,\nwhere somebody made there way through all\n\n46\n00:02:21.873 --> 00:02:24.460\nthe different layered\nsecurity that they had.\n\n47\n00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.440\nWas able to get into their hard drives,\nsteal their private key, and\n\n48\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.510\nissue a whole bunch of bogus\ncertificates to themselves, and well,\n\n49\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.660\nthat business is no longer in business.\n\n50\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.920\nSo, it's definitely something that will\nbring your business continuity to a stop,\n\n51\n00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.300\nso you definitely have\nto worry about that.\n\n52\n00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.430\n>> So, let's talk a little bit now,\nif you've been watching the whole series,\n\n53\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.120\nwe've actually already talked about\na little bit of storage security,\n\n54\n00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.500\nback when we were talking\nabout setting up storage for\n\n55\n00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.170\nyou virtualization platform cuz\nit's just kind of hand in hand.\n\n56\n00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.860\nYou set up security at the same time\nas you set up the infrastructure.\n\n57\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.730\nBut let's just recap some of those\ntechnologies real quick in case\n\n58\n00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.720\nwe've forgotten.\n\n59\n00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.830\nOne of the first things\nthat we talked about.\n\n60\n00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.470\nI've got a little diagram here.\n\n61\n00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.000\nWe talked about how on a SAN,\nwe've got many different hard drives.\n\n62\n00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.006\nAnd those hard drives maybe run\ninto a fiber switch like this one.\n\n63\n00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:11.700\nAnd then on top of that you've\ngot all of your servers and\n\n64\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.400\nstuff that are connected in from there.\n\n65\n00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.650\nSo I might have a web server,\na database server, and a mail server.\n\n66\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.920\nWell, the challenge with having\na storage area network is if somebody\n\n67\n00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.280\nhacks into the first web server right\nhere, they get into this web server.\n\n68\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.280\nAnd now, they could start spoofing\nworldwide names or HPA identifiers,\n\n69\n00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.070\nor whatever to try and access drives\nother than the one assigned to them.\n\n70\n00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.221\nOn a SAN by default when you connect\na physical host up to a SAN,\n\n71\n00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:45.978\nit sees all of the drives,\nit sees every single drive on that system.\n\n72\n00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:49.678\nAnd then we tell it, you're the web server\nso you just connect to this one drive, so\n\n73\n00:03:49.678 --> 00:03:53.278\nmy web server's green, it's gonna connect\nto this green hard drive and that's it,\n\n74\n00:03:53.278 --> 00:03:55.690\nwe tell it to do that\nwhen we configure it.\n\n75\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.960\nBut if a hacker gets in there,\nthey can say, all right, well, yeah,\n\n76\n00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.610\nyou can connect to the green drive, that's\ngreat, but let's connect to the purple\n\n77\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.650\ndrive also, and these red drives and these\nblue drives, let's connect to all of them.\n\n78\n00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.230\nAnd now, from this one compromised\nweb server, they can access data for\n\n79\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.900\nthe database server and\ndata for the mail server\n\n80\n00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.640\nwithout logging in cuz they're not\ngoing to your software anymore.\n\n81\n00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.900\nThis is hardware access.\n\n82\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.010\nThey're physically accessing those drives,\nand bypassing all of your security.\n\n83\n00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.520\nSo, we have a challenge.\n\n84\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.420\nAnd how do we fix that?\n\n85\n00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.950\nHow do we prevent that?\n\n86\n00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.470\nWell, I talked about three technologies\nin another episode that addressed this,\n\n87\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.990\none of which was what's\ncalled LUN masking.\n\n88\n00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.118\nLUN masking is where we say, all right,\nwhen I create this hard drive on the SAN,\n\n89\n00:04:36.118 --> 00:04:37.781\nso I create my green hard drive.\n\n90\n00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:41.670\nWhen we make that green drive, it has to\nget a logical unit number, a LUN number.\n\n91\n00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.160\nSo, maybe this one's LUN number five.\n\n92\n00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.500\nAnd I can create an access control list,\nan ACL that says,\n\n93\n00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.040\nonly this host, only WEB01 is allowed\nto access this LUN and that's it.\n\n94\n00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.080\nI don't want anyone else to access it,\njust this one.\n\n95\n00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.364\nAnd then on this purple drive, maybe it's\nLUN number seven, and so I tell it, hey,\n\n96\n00:05:05.364 --> 00:05:08.510\nthe only person who can\naccess this is web server 02.\n\n97\n00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.284\nAnd so now if I go to web server 01, and\nI fire up my disk management utility or\n\n98\n00:05:13.284 --> 00:05:17.020\nwhatever, LVM,\nwhatever is that I'm running.\n\n99\n00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.750\nIt can scan the SAN, and\nit'll only see one LUN and\n\n100\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.840\nthat's it,\nit'll just see the LUN attached to it.\n\n101\n00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.360\nThat's called LUN masking, and\n\n102\n00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.580\nit works by mapping the LUN numbers to\nthe hosts that are allowed to connect.\n\n103\n00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.670\nThis database server here,\nit has two hard drives.\n\n104\n00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.690\nSo there'd be two LUNs, and\n\n105\n00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.210\nboth of them would be allowed to\nbe seen by that database server.\n\n106\n00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.288\nSo that it would see two LUNs, but\nit wouldn't see anybody else's stuff.\n\n107\n00:05:41.288 --> 00:05:44.500\nNow, it's easy thing to apply.\n\n108\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.010\nWhen you create a LUN\nyou just set that list,\n\n109\n00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.470\nit's no big deal, but\nit's also an easy thing to defeat.\n\n110\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.419\nIf a hacker breaks into\none of your systems,\n\n111\n00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.257\nall they have to do is start\nspoofing the HPA identifier.\n\n112\n00:05:56.257 --> 00:06:00.677\nAnd as they do that, they can hope to\neventually hit the right identifier to be\n\n113\n00:06:00.677 --> 00:06:03.300\nable to see other discs on the network.\n\n114\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.040\nAnd your HPA identifiers\nare normally 48-bit or 64-bit.\n\n115\n00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.357\nAnd so when you've got a 64-bit number,\n\n116\n00:06:10.357 --> 00:06:14.220\nhow many possible combinations\nof that are there?\n\n117\n00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.660\nWell, there's billions.\n\n118\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.970\nActually, there's quadrillions of numbers,\nbut for a computer to sit there and\n\n119\n00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.010\nrifle through them, it can be doing\nthis in the background running for\n\n120\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.690\ndays before it starts to hit\nsome of the other numbers.\n\n121\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:26.703\nAnd they'll get it eventually.\n\n122\n00:06:26.703 --> 00:06:30.890\nYou've got better odds than the lottery,\nI think on some of these things.\n\n123\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.190\nSo, they can hit it eventually,\nand that's a problem.\n\n124\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.840\nSo LUN masking is one option,\nbut there's better options, and\n\n125\n00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.790\nsome of the better options I talked about\nwere VSANs and Zoning, there we go.\n\n126\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.253\n[LAUGH] Had a little brain freeze there.\n\n127\n00:06:45.253 --> 00:06:46.230\nVSANs and Zoning.\n\n128\n00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.990\nI always have a hard time remembering\nZoning cuz I don't really use Zoning\n\n129\n00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.490\nanymore, VSAN is kind of replaced it, and\nso VSANs are what we'll typically go with.\n\n130\n00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.060\nAnd they work on the same principle.\n\n131\n00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.717\nWhat they do is they say, look when we\ndo the security through LUN masking,\n\n132\n00:06:58.717 --> 00:07:00.823\nit can be spoofed, and that's a problem.\n\n133\n00:07:00.823 --> 00:07:03.112\nI don't want somebody spoofing\nthe data and defeating my security,\n\n134\n00:07:03.112 --> 00:07:05.020\nI need something that's a little tighter.\n\n135\n00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.725\nAnd so what a VSAN does is it says is,\ninstead of applying security on the SAN,\n\n136\n00:07:08.725 --> 00:07:10.723\nlet's apply the security on the switch.\n\n137\n00:07:10.723 --> 00:07:15.038\nAnd on the switch,\nwhat you can do is you can say,\n\n138\n00:07:15.038 --> 00:07:22.003\nthis physical port right here, this port\nis allowed to see this LUN down here.\n\n139\n00:07:22.003 --> 00:07:25.105\nAnd the way it does it,\nis it sees these LUNs come in, and\n\n140\n00:07:25.105 --> 00:07:28.385\nit sees these hosts come in,\nand it uses worldwide names.\n\n141\n00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:31.110\nWorldwide names that are associated\nwith the physical ports, and\n\n142\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.130\nit says,\nthis port is allowed to access this LUN.\n\n143\n00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.460\nNow, it doesn't care who's\nplugged into that port.\n\n144\n00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.490\nWhoever does plug in to the portal\nwill only be able to see that one LUN.\n\n145\n00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.035\nSo if a hacker breaks in, and\nthey break into this web server, and\n\n146\n00:07:44.035 --> 00:07:48.225\nthey start spoofing the ID, it doesn't\nmatter cuz that ID is not being used,\n\n147\n00:07:48.225 --> 00:07:50.628\nit's the identifier of the physical port.\n\n148\n00:07:50.628 --> 00:07:54.867\nNow, the only way they'd be able to see\nthose LUNs would be if they were to\n\n149\n00:07:54.867 --> 00:07:59.732\ncome in, and say, they unplugged to the\ndatabase server, I'll just yank that And\n\n150\n00:07:59.732 --> 00:08:03.235\nthen took the web server and\nplugged it in over here, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:03.235 --> 00:08:06.010\nNow, are you gonna notice\nthat that happened?\n\n152\n00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.670\nI sure hope so, right, because first off,\nyour database server went offline.\n\n153\n00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:15.070\nAnd secondly, they had to physically be in\nyour building to move that cable, right?\n\n154\n00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:19.820\nSo now we've stopped somebody from being\nable to get into our data at rest,\n\n155\n00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.340\nthe data that's on the SAN remotely.\n\n156\n00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.070\nThey would have to physically be in\nthe building and able to move that.\n\n157\n00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.700\nAnd you now how you defeat that?\n\n158\n00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.680\nA locked door.\n\n159\n00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.960\nIt's not hard, right?\n\n160\n00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.360\nYou have a locked door\ninto your server room,\n\n161\n00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.500\nyou don't allow unauthorized personnel\nin there, and you've defeated this.\n\n162\n00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.260\nExcept, if it's one of the administrators,\nor even you.\n\n163\n00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.270\nMaybe you're that disgruntled employee,\nand you're like, screw it,\n\n164\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.090\nI'm getting at this data.\n\n165\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.460\nI wanna find out how much money\nthe CEO makes, and you go and\n\n166\n00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.360\nyou move that cable and\nyou start looking at it, right.\n\n167\n00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.950\nThat attack is still very real.\n\n168\n00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.690\nIt's difficult to prevent from\nevery possibility, right.\n\n169\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:56.140\nSo there's a lot of different things\nthat could creep up, but doing VSANs or\n\n170\n00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.460\ndoing zoning will take care of that.\n\n171\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.980\nNow with the zoning,\nI divide up my ports and my LUNs and\n\n172\n00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.740\nI just kinda slice it up and that's that.\n\n173\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.940\nZoning is very much like setting up\na VLAN, VSANs are basically the same way,\n\n174\n00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.820\nexcept VSANs can span multiple switches.\n\n175\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.249\nAnd so when you implement a VSAN, you\ncould actually have more than one physical\n\n176\n00:09:15.249 --> 00:09:17.466\nSAN behind it and\nyou can have more than one switch.\n\n177\n00:09:17.466 --> 00:09:22.860\nAnd so I could say, like maybe Node 1 and\nNode 2 here, these guys are in a cluster.\n\n178\n00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.061\nThey're clustered together.\n\n179\n00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:28.546\nAnd so I want them both to see these two\nhard drives and so I can create a VSAN.\n\n180\n00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:31.725\nAnd when they connect it up, they would\nthink they were looking at one SAN, but\n\n181\n00:09:31.725 --> 00:09:34.560\nthey're actually seeing LUNs from\ntwo different physical SAN's.\n\n182\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.350\nYou can have a lot of really cool\nstuff masked behind a VSAN, so\n\n183\n00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.380\nit's a more powerful form of zoning.\n\n184\n00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.420\nZoning is just done on the switch and\nwe start to break that up, creating\n\n185\n00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.090\nthese zones of ports, and we would say\nnode 1 and node 2 are in the same zone.\n\n186\n00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.520\nAnd these two LUNs are in that zone,\nand as a result, those nodes and\n\n187\n00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.300\nthose LUNs are all visible to each other.\n\n188\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.190\nBut with a VSAN,\nwe can really start to get bigger.\n\n189\n00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.760\nIt's some cool stuff you can do with that,\nbut the technologies work the same.\n\n190\n00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.480\nAnd so we talked about all\nof these in another episode.\n\n191\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.450\nWe talked about LUN masking, VSANs,\nand zoning, and I kinda showed how to\n\n192\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.960\nconfigure that on a VLAN switch and\non a SAN, so we got a chance to see those.\n\n193\n00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.650\nBut just to recap,\nthose were some principles right there.\n\n194\n00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.210\nThey've all got their benefits,\nthey've all got their weaknesses, right?\n\n195\n00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.500\nThere's nothing that's a perfect solution,\nso\n\n196\n00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.100\noftentimes we'll use\ncombinations of these.\n\n197\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.960\nYou might use LUN masking in combination\nwith VSANs to achieve your goal and\n\n198\n00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.220\nyou certainly can do that.\n\n199\n00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:27.950\n>> And at that,\n\n200\n00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.620\nthey talk about the ten immutable\nlaws of security at Microsoft, right?\n\n201\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.640\nIf I can touch your computer,\nwell it's really no longer your computer.\n\n202\n00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.660\nI'm sure that'd be that\nsame thing with a SAN.\n\n203\n00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.480\nIf you got a malicious insider,\nwe do all we want.\n\n204\n00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.706\nWe can do zoning, we can do LUN masking.\n\n205\n00:10:42.706 --> 00:10:44.710\nBut if somebody's got physical\naccess to that device,\n\n206\n00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.710\nwell you've got bigger\nproblems to worry about.\n\n207\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.030\n>> Absolutely, yup.\n\n208\n00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.040\nAnd even on top of that, we probably\ndon't want to stop there, right?\n\n209\n00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.876\nSo you set up your LUN masking, you set up\nyour VSANs, whatever it is that you set up\n\n210\n00:10:53.876 --> 00:10:56.990\nand you get it all put in place,\nyou probably don't wanna stop there.\n\n211\n00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.730\nBecause if somebody can\ngain physical access,\n\n212\n00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.950\nthey can just rip the hard drives out and\nwalk away.\n\n213\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.130\nAnd at that point,\ndo the LUN masks even matter?\n\n214\n00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.654\nDo the VSANs even matter, does the ID?\n\n215\n00:11:06.654 --> 00:11:07.910\nNone of that matters anymore.\n\n216\n00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.170\nThey rip the hard drives out,\nthey got your data.\n\n217\n00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.440\nAnd so we're normally gonna combine\nthese technologies with data encryption.\n\n218\n00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.310\nWe're gonna encrypt the data at rest.\n\n219\n00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.156\nNow, if your storage area network is in\na secure facility, locked in a server room\n\n220\n00:11:21.156 --> 00:11:24.859\nthat you have full control over, you\nmay choose not to do encryption, right.\n\n221\n00:11:24.859 --> 00:11:27.900\nAnd there's plenty of good reasons,\nI know some of you out there are like,\n\n222\n00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.941\nthat's crazy talk,\nwhy wouldn't I encrypt it?\n\n223\n00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:33.760\nWell, encryption hurts performance,\nit's a fact, right.\n\n224\n00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.280\nIf I write unencrypted data to a hard\ndrive, it happens very quickly,\n\n225\n00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.190\nif I need to encrypt it first,\nI gonna slow down for a second.\n\n226\n00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.420\nEven if I have hardware accelerators,\nthere's still a little bit of a slow down.\n\n227\n00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.120\nSo we take a performance\nhit when we encrypt data.\n\n228\n00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.311\nIf your SAN is secured and no unauthorized\npersonnel has physical access to it,\n\n229\n00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:55.040\nthen you're not really needed\nto do encryption on that.\n\n230\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.030\nYour data's safe, right.\n\n231\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.590\nYou've got it, but a lot of times, we're\ndeploying these virtual machine hosts in\n\n232\n00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.400\nenvironments we don't necessarily control.\n\n233\n00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.700\nLike, maybe you work for\na school board and\n\n234\n00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.820\nso you work at the main IT center for\nyour county or state.\n\n235\n00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.310\nAnd then in each city, in each school,\nyou've got a server deployed.\n\n236\n00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.010\nAnd you know it's there, you deployed it,\n\n237\n00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.710\nbut you don't know who has access\nto that room the server is in.\n\n238\n00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.080\nYou're not at that school every day,\nand who knows,\n\n239\n00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.080\nmaybe the janitor leaves the door unlocked\nand a student gets in there, right?\n\n240\n00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.260\nSo now I can't trust it.\n\n241\n00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.610\nAnd so it's worth it to take\nthe performance hit to encrypt that data.\n\n242\n00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.900\nWhen we encrypt that data now it's safe,\nit's a hair bit slower, but\n\n243\n00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.490\nI'm okay with that because\nat least my data is safe.\n\n244\n00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.310\nWhere it's even more\nimportant is in the cloud.\n\n245\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.820\nIf we're deploying these\nsystems up into a cloud system,\n\n246\n00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.550\nlike Amazon Web Services, right?\n\n247\n00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:48.190\nI use the heck out of Amazon Web Services,\nI use their systems every single day.\n\n248\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.430\nIn fact if you're watching this show,\npieces of this show are coming to you\n\n249\n00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.990\nfrom Amazon Web Services, so it's\ndefinitely a very commonly used thing.\n\n250\n00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.180\nThat being said,\n\n251\n00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:03.650\nI can't name a single employee that works\nin a data center at Amazon Web Services.\n\n252\n00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.045\nI don't know.\nI know executives,\n\n253\n00:13:05.045 --> 00:13:06.322\npeople that are higher up.\n\n254\n00:13:06.322 --> 00:13:10.020\nBut I don't know anybody that's\nactually in the data center doing work.\n\n255\n00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:10.720\nNot a single person.\n\n256\n00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.430\nAnd I'm suppose to trust them.\n\n257\n00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.790\nI'm suppose to trust them with that data.\n\n258\n00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.000\nAnd that trust is hard to get,\nhere's one example.\n\n259\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.430\nIf I deploy a virtual\nmachine on AWS right now, and\n\n260\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.330\nlet's say I give it a 64 gig hard drive.\n\n261\n00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.647\nRight, so the virtual hard drive\nis created for me that's 64 gigs.\n\n262\n00:13:27.647 --> 00:13:31.511\nAnd I put really sensitive data in there,\nright, just stuff that's really sensitive,\n\n263\n00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:33.260\ncustomer data, credit card data.\n\n264\n00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.070\nRight, I go crazy, lose my mind,\nput credit card data in there.\n\n265\n00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.180\nAnd then I'm done with whatever\nit is that I'm done doing,\n\n266\n00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.080\nwhich probably wasn't a good\nthing to do in the first place.\n\n267\n00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.470\nBut I get done doing whatever that is,\nand when I'm done,\n\n268\n00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.200\nI delete my virtual machine, okay?\n\n269\n00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.380\nWell I delete it.\n\n270\n00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.400\nThat 64 gig hard drive goes away.\n\n271\n00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.460\nWell, what happens to\nthat 64 gigs of storage?\n\n272\n00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.270\nAmazon looks at it and they say,\nall right, well you're done with it.\n\n273\n00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.140\nSomebody else can use it now.\n\n274\n00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.700\nLet's go ahead and\nprovision it to somebody else.\n\n275\n00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.030\nSo somebody else spins\nup a virtual machine.\n\n276\n00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.060\nAnd they get assigned that 64 gigs of\nstorage, or you know, bigger or smaller.\n\n277\n00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.000\nThey get a piece of it, whatever, they\nget some of that same physical storage.\n\n278\n00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.835\nWhat's to stop that customer from\ninstalling forensic software on there and\n\n279\n00:14:08.835 --> 00:14:11.140\nscanning the hard drives?\n\n280\n00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.170\nWhat's to stop them?\n\n281\n00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.813\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\n282\n00:14:12.813 --> 00:14:13.700\nYou can do it.\n\n283\n00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.400\nGive it a shot one day.\n\n284\n00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.620\nIf you deploy a virtual machine in Azure,\na virtual machine in AWS, you can install\n\n285\n00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.440\nforensic software on it and start scanning\nthe hard drives and potentially find data.\n\n286\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.750\nI say potentially,\nbecause they know about that too.\n\n287\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.950\nAnd so, with Amazon,\nwhen you delete that virtual machine,\n\n288\n00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.970\nthey don't just immediately reprovision\nyour hard drive to somebody else.\n\n289\n00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.070\nThey sanitize it.\n\n290\n00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.840\nIt actually runs through a DOD sweep.\n\n291\n00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.250\nI think they do like\na seven pass erase on it\n\n292\n00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.180\nbefore they issue it to another customer.\n\n293\n00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.250\nSo by the time it gets issued to another\ncustomer, it has been sanitized, right?\n\n294\n00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.030\nThat's what they tell us.\n\n295\n00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.560\nAt that point,\n\n296\n00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.940\nthe data's out of my control,\nI don't have access to it anymore.\n\n297\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.150\nI can't verify they actually\ndo the seven passes,\n\n298\n00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.080\nI can't verify the data's clean, and\nI can't verify that if I were to run\n\n299\n00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.890\nforensic software on there that\nI couldn't recover my own data.\n\n300\n00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.430\nWe have to trust, right?\n\n301\n00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.840\nWell, you don't have to trust.\n\n302\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.290\nYou could encrypt your data.\n\n303\n00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.530\nIf you encrypt the data,\nthen you don't have to worry about it.\n\n304\n00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.880\nIf Amazon gives that data to somebody\nelse, and they don't do the seven passes,\n\n305\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.380\nyou're safe,\ncuz if they run forensic software,\n\n306\n00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.370\nthey're just gonna see encrypted versions\nof your data, and it's safe, right?\n\n307\n00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.570\nSo, when you're deploying in the cloud,\nor, really anywhere where it's not\n\n308\n00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.784\ntrustworthy, it's a good\nidea to encrypt that data.\n\n309\n00:15:19.784 --> 00:15:24.070\nBecause that way you can guarantee control\nand safety of your information even after\n\n310\n00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.290\nit leaves your hands, and\nthat's really important.\n\n311\n00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.420\n>> Now we talked about this a little\nbit before we started the episode, Don.\n\n312\n00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.310\nDo you really have to pay attention to who\nis holding those keys because if I've got,\n\n313\n00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.050\nin another episode we talked about\nasymmetric key encryption, and\n\n314\n00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:39.740\nthe private key is very, very important.\n\n315\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.446\nAnd typically, if I'm sending you\nencrypted data, I've got your public key,\n\n316\n00:15:43.446 --> 00:15:45.095\nbut I don't have your private key.\n\n317\n00:15:45.095 --> 00:15:48.847\nSo, key management would also be something\nthat'd come into play there, right?\n\n318\n00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:50.950\n>> Absolutely, and\nyou've got to be careful with that.\n\n319\n00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.422\nSo what Wes is talking about is,\n\n320\n00:15:52.422 --> 00:15:55.377\nif I encrypt the data There's\na private key somewhere, right?\n\n321\n00:15:55.377 --> 00:15:57.199\nWe talked about it in\nthe encryption episode.\n\n322\n00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:00.440\nSo whoever has that private\nkey can decrypt my data.\n\n323\n00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.220\nA lot of these vendors, like Amazon,\noffer encryption services.\n\n324\n00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.050\nLet me show you here.\n\n325\n00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.410\nI've got that parked\naround here somewhere.\n\n326\n00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.020\nHere, all right.\n\n327\n00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.220\nSo I'm in AWS, and you know what,\nI'm singling out Amazon.\n\n328\n00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.580\nPlease remember this applies to everybody,\nnot just Amazon,\n\n329\n00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.630\nI just happen to like Amazon, so\nthat's why I kind of use them more.\n\n330\n00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.220\nBut if I go into AWS and I go to spin up\na virtual machine, so I'm gonna jump in\n\n331\n00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.720\nhere, I'm gonna go to my instances, and\nI'm gonna whip up a new server, right?\n\n332\n00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.750\nSo I wanna launch some kind of instance.\n\n333\n00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.940\nAnd when I do that, I'm picking\nan instance that I wanna run and\n\n334\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.210\nI'm picking a size and all that.\n\n335\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:37.350\nAnd when I get to the Storage page, right,\nas soon as I get there, here, okay?\n\n336\n00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:38.940\nI've got a root volume, and\n\n337\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.990\nthe root volume is being provisioned\nfrom a snapshot that they made.\n\n338\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.939\nThey made this operating system, okay, and\n\n339\n00:16:43.939 --> 00:16:46.159\nsince they made it that\nsnapshot is not encrypted.\n\n340\n00:16:46.159 --> 00:16:49.843\nAnd so when you get over here I can see\nit's got this Encrypted column, and\n\n341\n00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:51.900\nit says data's not encrypted, right.\n\n342\n00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.217\nIt's not encrypted because\nthey made the image.\n\n343\n00:16:54.217 --> 00:16:57.450\nThey made it, so obviously they can read\nit, they know all the data that's on it.\n\n344\n00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.190\nIt's not encrypted.\n\n345\n00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.090\nBut if I'm gonna put data up here, I don't\nwanna put data on this drive anyway,\n\n346\n00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.480\nbecause that's part of what they\ncall their ephemeral storage and\n\n347\n00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.260\nit can get erased when you have failover.\n\n348\n00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.910\nSo when you're storing data up\non a virtual machine like this,\n\n349\n00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.697\nyou always wanna add your own storage,\nright.\n\n350\n00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.660\nAlways, that's the key word there.\n\n351\n00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.820\nYou always wanna add a second drive for\nyour own storage.\n\n352\n00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.870\nThat's where your data's gonna go,\ndata you wanna keep.\n\n353\n00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.420\nAnd when you provision that,\nit's up to you to put data on there.\n\n354\n00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.872\nAnd it's empty by default.\n\n355\n00:17:25.872 --> 00:17:27.780\nThere is no snapshot that\nit's building off of.\n\n356\n00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.780\nAnd Amazon gives me this nice\nlittle check mark right here.\n\n357\n00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.017\nI can encrypt the data.\n\n358\n00:17:32.017 --> 00:17:36.520\nAnd if I check that,\nnow they'll encrypt the data for me.\n\n359\n00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.520\nOkay now, if they're encrypting\nthe data for me, how do they do that?\n\n360\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.840\nThey've gotta have the private key.\n\n361\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.100\nThey gotta have the key\nto encrypt the data, and\n\n362\n00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.370\nthe key might be stored in my account.\n\n363\n00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.730\nIt might be my key that\nonly I have access to, but\n\n364\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.660\nthey've got access to my account which\nmeans they have access to the key.\n\n365\n00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.013\nSo now the data's encrypted.\n\n366\n00:17:52.013 --> 00:17:56.208\nIf another customer gets this system,\nthey'll be able to read the operating\n\n367\n00:17:56.208 --> 00:18:00.160\nsystem drive because, well that was\njust based off an Amazon snapshot.\n\n368\n00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.510\nThere's nothing secret there.\n\n369\n00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.820\nThat's Amazon's image anyway.\n\n370\n00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.130\nBut my drive that had\nthe data would be encrypted.\n\n371\n00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.770\nThey wouldn't be able to get at it.\n\n372\n00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.600\nBut Amazon's got the key,\nAmazon could get at it.\n\n373\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.320\nSo if Amazon gets subpoenaed or whatever,\n\n374\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.500\nthey would have to turn over that key to\nthe authorities and get access to it.\n\n375\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.170\nNow, if you're not doing anything illegal,\nthat's no big deal, but\n\n376\n00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:24.380\nit is still kind of giving up that right,\nright, that privacy.\n\n377\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.860\nAnd so even though it might not be\na big deal you still don't necessarily\n\n378\n00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.780\nwant that to happen.\n\n379\n00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.880\nIf you're doing something illegal you\ndefinitely don't want to tap in, right?\n\n380\n00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.020\nBut even if you're doing legal things,\n\n381\n00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.730\nit's still kind of\noverstepping the bounds.\n\n382\n00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:37.640\nSo with this,\nyou're still trusting Amazon and if you're\n\n383\n00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.070\nalready trusting them to wipe the data\nthen you might as well not encrypt and\n\n384\n00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:42.130\nget a performance benefit out of it,\nright?\n\n385\n00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.950\nBut if you want to be a little\nmore shrewd you can check this.\n\n386\n00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.701\nInstead you can do what Wes\nwas alluding to which was,\n\n387\n00:18:47.701 --> 00:18:49.979\nI'm not going to use\nthe encryption at all.\n\n388\n00:18:49.979 --> 00:18:54.595\nIf this is a Linux machine, I can use\nthe EXT file system to format this, and\n\n389\n00:18:54.595 --> 00:18:58.000\nI can encrypt it in EXT, and\nthen only I have the key.\n\n390\n00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.630\nAmazon doesn't have the key, I made it.\n\n391\n00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.140\nI put it in there, I encrypted it.\n\n392\n00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.100\nIf I'm doing Windows, I can use\nBitLocker to encrypt that drive, and\n\n393\n00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.200\nnow I only have the key.\n\n394\n00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.260\nOr I could even do some\nkind of virtual format.\n\n395\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.339\nYou could use Truecrypt or Vericrypt or\nwhatever name they're going by these days,\n\n396\n00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:16.510\nand, you can create an encrypted\nvolume stored on this storage.\n\n397\n00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.944\nAnd so, the storage isn't encrypted, but\nthere's one big file on there that's\n\n398\n00:19:19.944 --> 00:19:23.470\na blob, that's got all of my encrypted\ndata in it, and I control the keys, right.\n\n399\n00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:27.270\nSo, just because the storage\nprovider gives you a way to encrypt,\n\n400\n00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.900\ndoesn't necessarily mean\nyou want to use it.\n\n401\n00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.160\nYou might still choose to use your\nown encryption inside of the guest\n\n402\n00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.770\noperating system itself,\nyou're certainly welcome to do that.\n\n403\n00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:36.610\nAll right, so\n\n404\n00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:40.890\nencryption can be provided by the host,\nby your type one hypervisor and\n\n405\n00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:45.750\nthe host, or it can be provided inside of\nthe guest that's running on top of this.\n\n406\n00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.600\nAnd when it's inside of the guest,\nyou have exclusive control of the keys.\n\n407\n00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.930\nAll right,\nnow few other things I want to mention.\n\n408\n00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.440\nOn the exam, for whatever reason\nthey call it obfuscation and\n\n409\n00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.060\nI'm not entirely sure what\nCompTIA was reaching for\n\n410\n00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.280\nwhen they threw obfuscation on here,\nbut I want to mention it.\n\n411\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.460\nWhen you encrypt data, the encrypted data\n\n412\n00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.890\nhas no resemblance to\nthe original data itself.\n\n413\n00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.310\nSo I might just be encrypting\nthe word the, T-H-E, three letters.\n\n414\n00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.350\nWhen I encrypt it, I'm not necessarily\ngonna have three characters.\n\n415\n00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.736\nI might have 100 characters that\nrepresent just the word the.\n\n416\n00:20:20.736 --> 00:20:23.600\nOr I might even have just one character\nthat represents the word the.\n\n417\n00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.900\nRight, it bears no resemblance.\n\n418\n00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.330\nBut you can secure data\nthrough obfuscation.\n\n419\n00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:33.130\nIn obfuscation, the data you create\nactually does resemble the original data.\n\n420\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.370\nAnd it's not very good\nbecause it's reversible.\n\n421\n00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.960\nMost encryption you can't\nreverse without having the key.\n\n422\n00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.150\nObfuscated data you can.\n\n423\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.680\nYou can figure it out.\n\n424\n00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.790\nAnd I'll just show you\nan example here real quick.\n\n425\n00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.950\nSo let's say I wanted to\nsend Wes my password.\n\n426\n00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:53.160\nSo I say, my password is password123.\n\n427\n00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.000\nSo I wanna send this to Wes, but\nI want it to be safe, right?\n\n428\n00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.650\nSo what I can do is I\ncan obfuscate this data.\n\n429\n00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:05.610\nAnd you obfuscate it by entering\nin seemingly random data into it.\n\n430\n00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.435\nAnd so I might interject three\n\n431\n00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:15.620\ncharacters after every single letter,\nright?\n\n432\n00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:19.358\nSo, I'm just coming in and well,\nyou see how random the human hand can be.\n\n433\n00:21:19.358 --> 00:21:24.640\nI'm starting to get a little\nlost in here but, so basically,\n\n434\n00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.883\nwhat I'm doing is just interjecting three\ncharacters in between each letter or\n\n435\n00:21:28.883 --> 00:21:31.780\nsymbol, I can even do symbols yet,\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n436\n00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:38.310\nSo, I just kinda punch in this in and\nI'm obfuscating the data, all right?\n\n437\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.824\nNow, when you look at this,\nat first glance,\n\n438\n00:21:40.824 --> 00:21:44.832\nright you know I'm kinda getting bored,\nso we'll cut off the end there.\n\n439\n00:21:44.832 --> 00:21:48.780\nSo at first glance this looks\nlike random garbage, right?\n\n440\n00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.990\nWhen you look at that,\nit looks like a random encrypted string.\n\n441\n00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.080\nBut it's actually not,\nit's just obfuscated.\n\n442\n00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.930\nAnd if you can figure out the secret,\nthen you can interpret this and\n\n443\n00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.380\nyou don't need a key, you just need\nto understand the random data.\n\n444\n00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.900\nSo if I look at this and I say okay,\nwell all I did was interject three extra\n\n445\n00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:13.200\ncompletely random characters in-between\neach real character, I could tell Wes,\n\n446\n00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.330\nhey, here's my password, and by the way,\nonly look at every third letter.\n\n447\n00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.660\n>> Right,\nsomething like maybe first minus three.\n\n448\n00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.520\nLook at that first character and\nthen everything else minus three and\n\n449\n00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.050\nthose will be your characters\nsequentially following it.\n\n450\n00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.160\n>> Yeah, or I guess here it\nwould be every fourth character.\n\n451\n00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.430\n>> Fourth character sure.\n\n452\n00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:31.050\n>> So if we go through here and just start\ndeleting out those extra characters that I\n\n453\n00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:37.290\nadded after each one,\nyou see it starts to reassemble itself.\n\n454\n00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.780\nAnd now we very easily get at this data,\nokay?\n\n455\n00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.950\nNow, shoot, I deleted the prompt.\n\n456\n00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:49.970\n[LAUGH] So apparently I've defeated myself\nwith this encryption, but here we go.\n\n457\n00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.850\nSo we don't necessarily have\nto bore ourself with all this.\n\n458\n00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:54.958\n>> So secret you don't even\nknow what you're doing.\n\n459\n00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:56.166\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know.\n\n460\n00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:58.950\n[LAUGH] That's not really\nsaying much these days, is it?\n\n461\n00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.320\nBut we go through,\nwe start clearing this out,\n\n462\n00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.870\nnow I've reassembled that password\nfrom those RAM characters.\n\n463\n00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.820\nNow, obfuscation's reversible,\nit's not very secure.\n\n464\n00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.250\nIt also kills performance because\nif you think about it, for\n\n465\n00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.120\nevery character I'm writing,\nI actually have to write four characters,\n\n466\n00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.920\nthe original character and\nthree random ones.\n\n467\n00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.170\nAnd I've gotta do a random generator\nto get those random characters in for\n\n468\n00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.320\nthose extra three.\n\n469\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.730\nSo there's a little bit of work.\n\n470\n00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.200\nIt's really the same as\nif I had encrypted it.\n\n471\n00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.060\nI might as well have\njust encrypted the data.\n\n472\n00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.200\nSo obfuscation,\nit is a way of hiding data.\n\n473\n00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.130\nIt's kind of hiding it in plain sight.\n\n474\n00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:32.660\nAnd it makes it look good, looks kind of\ncool but it's really not very strong.\n\n475\n00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.908\nSo some storage may offer to do that,\nto just obfuscate your data or\n\n476\n00:23:35.908 --> 00:23:39.272\nyou may to choose to obfuscate your\nown data, so you're writing text\n\n477\n00:23:39.272 --> 00:23:42.709\nfiles into non-encrypted data,\ninto storage and you obfuscate it.\n\n478\n00:23:42.709 --> 00:23:46.005\nJust be familiar, it's not an encryption\nalgorithm, it's not a formula or\n\n479\n00:23:46.005 --> 00:23:47.434\nprotocol or anything like that.\n\n480\n00:23:47.434 --> 00:23:50.195\nThat's why we didn't cover it\nin the encryption episode.\n\n481\n00:23:50.195 --> 00:23:52.285\nBut it is on the objective, so\nI just wanted to point that out.\n\n482\n00:23:52.285 --> 00:23:54.549\n>> What if we have users\nthat are authorized?\n\n483\n00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:58.111\nWe talk about, and we have mentioned,\nconfidentiality, integrity, and\n\n484\n00:23:58.111 --> 00:24:00.310\navailability in our security chapters.\n\n485\n00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.110\nWe mentioned it a little\nbit here with encryption.\n\n486\n00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:05.440\nWe make it so where eavesdroppers\ncan't get into that data, but\n\n487\n00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.560\navailability is a very,\nvery important thing, and\n\n488\n00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.610\nwe have authorized users that\nneed access to the information.\n\n489\n00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.660\nIs there a way of controlling\nthe authorized users,\n\n490\n00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.970\nthe people that we want to\nhave access to this data?\n\n491\n00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.290\nCan we restrict them in a way?\n\n492\n00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.360\n>> Absolutely, absolutely, yeah.\n\n493\n00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.430\nSo I mentioned access control lists,\nand ACLs are very common.\n\n494\n00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.790\nI think we even looked at those back\nin the other security episodes.\n\n495\n00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.720\nBut, just to recap that,\nif I take a server,\n\n496\n00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.190\nlike I'll take this one,\nif I know my password.\n\n497\n00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:32.650\nThis is a Windows server.\n\n498\n00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:36.930\nI like security in most systems, but\nin Windows they make it very visual and\n\n499\n00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:41.060\neasy to see, that when you have files and\nfolders, or even entire drives,\n\n500\n00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.840\nI might have a storage drive somewhere, or\nwhatever, that I can take those files and\n\n501\n00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.310\nfolders, and if I jump into their\npermissions and their security,\n\n502\n00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:54.680\nyou can define access control\nlists that say an administrator\n\n503\n00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.390\nhas full access to everything, but\nusers are only able to read and execute.\n\n504\n00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.150\nYou can create these ACLs.\n\n505\n00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:04.840\nAnd when you're setting up a virtual\nmachine platform, like Hyper-V,\n\n506\n00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.990\nwell your virtual machines have to get\nstored somewhere, and so you'll see here\n\n507\n00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:14.020\nif I go into my cluster storage that\nI've got a virtual machine here.\n\n508\n00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.170\nAnd here's the virtual hard drive for\nthe VN.\n\n509\n00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.930\nNow I want my servers to be\nable to get to this drive.\n\n510\n00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:25.140\nI don't want some random IT admin or\nhelp desk personnel to get it,\n\n511\n00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.990\nbecause they could just copy that VHD.\n\n512\n00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:30.020\nIf they're just reading a VHD,\nI might not even notice that.\n\n513\n00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.070\nThey could just copy that, and\nnow they can take it home and\n\n514\n00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.190\nbring it up on their own Hyper-V\nserver and get at all the data.\n\n515\n00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:36.850\nThey can take their time and\nbreak into it.\n\n516\n00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.777\nBut I might want to secure that, and\n\n517\n00:25:38.777 --> 00:25:41.990\nyou can certainly do that by\npulling up the properties, and\n\n518\n00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.863\ngoing into the security, and\ngranting your physical servers access.\n\n519\n00:25:45.863 --> 00:25:52.320\nSo I can come in here and add server\n01 and server 02, adding a system.\n\n520\n00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.820\nNow by default,\nit's not going to like that,\n\n521\n00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.630\nbecause by default it's looking for users,\n\n522\n00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:01.160\ngroups, or built-in security principles,\nso I need to add computers to that list.\n\n523\n00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.960\nAnd so now,\nit's going to accept computer names also.\n\n524\n00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:10.070\nAnd so I can grant SERVER01 and\nSERVER02 full control of that file.\n\n525\n00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.640\nThey need to boot that virtual machine.\n\n526\n00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.310\nThey need access to that VHD.\n\n527\n00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.740\nBut I can take users out.\n\n528\n00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.490\nLike, hey,\nI don't want users to have access.\n\n529\n00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.780\nI can deny them, or whatever, and\ntake them out and start to restrict it.\n\n530\n00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.220\nSo ACLs are one way to do that.\n\n531\n00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.800\nAnd then there's other ways.\n\n532\n00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.800\nIf you're setting up shared storage.\n\n533\n00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.801\nSo I've got an iSCSI SAN set up,\nlet's see, here.\n\n534\n00:26:29.801 --> 00:26:31.101\nI think it's on this server.\n\n535\n00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:34.693\n>> You know while you're logging in, one\nof the things I was thinking Don is that\n\n536\n00:26:34.693 --> 00:26:37.250\nthe authorization,\nthat's after the fact, right?\n\n537\n00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:41.500\nWe know that it's an authorized user,\nbut we do need some kind of mechanism or\n\n538\n00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.280\nway to even figure out,\nare they authorized?\n\n539\n00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.770\n>> Yeah, yeah, and for that we can use all\nsorts of authentication, usernames and\n\n540\n00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:49.000\npasswords and so on.\n\n541\n00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.420\nThat access control list I showed you,\nwe have to validate this user somehow.\n\n542\n00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.930\nAnd so Windows uses like MTML,\nthe old MT LAN manager,\n\n543\n00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.430\nor they use Kerberos to\ndo the authentication.\n\n544\n00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.270\nThere's different systems like that.\n\n545\n00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:05.060\nHere on this iSCSI SAN, and\neven on a traditional SAN, you can set\n\n546\n00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:09.400\nthings like validating their identifier,\ntheir ID, like we said with LUN masking.\n\n547\n00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.410\nYou can require a CHAP username and\npassword.\n\n548\n00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:17.315\nSo here's those virtual hard drives\nthat are mounted on my iSCSI server,\n\n549\n00:27:17.315 --> 00:27:19.291\nand when you work with those,\n\n550\n00:27:19.291 --> 00:27:23.588\nyou don't have a whole lot of\noptions here on the device itself.\n\n551\n00:27:23.588 --> 00:27:28.220\nBut in iSCSI, you create what\nare called iSCSI targets, and\n\n552\n00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:32.570\nmy targets are down here, and that's\nwhat your clients actually connect to.\n\n553\n00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:37.830\nAnd when you define the target,\nyou can specify what LUNs,\n\n554\n00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.940\nwhat hard drives, are available on it and\nwho is allowed to connect.\n\n555\n00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.300\nAnd so you'll notice here,\nI can go under security, and\n\n556\n00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.020\nI can turn on CHAP, challenge handshake.\n\n557\n00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.750\nIf somebody wants to connect and access\nthis storage, they are going to have to\n\n558\n00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.816\nprovide a user name and password just\nto even connect and see the storage.\n\n559\n00:27:54.816 --> 00:27:57.430\nBecause iSCSI is available on\ntheir regular TCICP network,\n\n560\n00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:00.390\nI might not want just any old person\nto try and connect to these drives.\n\n561\n00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.830\nI can authenticate them.\n\n562\n00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.860\nBut on top of that,\nI can go to Initiators, and\n\n563\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:09.660\nhere I can specify the iSCSI\nidentifiers or the IP addresses of\n\n564\n00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.980\nthe systems that are allowed to connect,\nand now only those people will connect.\n\n565\n00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.170\nBut somebody could spoof an IP,\ncouldn't they?\n\n566\n00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:21.030\nSo if I combine these, if I do the IP\nfilter and I do a CHAP user name and\n\n567\n00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.766\npassword, now I get\nthe best of both worlds.\n\n568\n00:28:23.766 --> 00:28:25.760\nNow they've got to have an IP,\nor identifier,\n\n569\n00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.950\nthat's the right name, and\nthey have to have a user name and\n\n570\n00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.968\npassword, and\nnow they're allowed to access it.\n\n571\n00:28:29.968 --> 00:28:32.740\nIt's basically multi-factor\nauthentication at that point, and\n\n572\n00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.070\nthey're able to get in and\naccess those disks.\n\n573\n00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:39.140\nOn a traditional SAN, these might be your\nHBA identifiers, but you also might have\n\n574\n00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.120\nCHAP to be able to do that challenge\nhandshake and authenticate the systems.\n\n575\n00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.040\n>> I noticed that you're in Hyper-V here,\n\n576\n00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.280\nand I'm going to throw\nyou a curve ball here.\n\n577\n00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.330\nYou talk about CHAP.\n\n578\n00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.930\nIs it limited to just CHAP?\n\n579\n00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:52.100\nBecause in the cloud today,\nlike you've shown us with Amazon,\n\n580\n00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:56.520\nyou can spin up a Linux server,\nyou can spin up a Windows-based server.\n\n581\n00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.440\nAnd I've really just been in\nthe Windows environment, and\n\n582\n00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.948\nI know you're not really stuck or\nmarried to any operating system.\n\n583\n00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:03.248\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n584\n00:29:03.248 --> 00:29:06.750\nwould MS Chat versus the non-Windows\nCHAP come into play here?\n\n585\n00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.590\nAre they pretty supportive across?\n\n586\n00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.520\n>> This is the official standard CHAP,\nnot the MS CHAP.\n\n587\n00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.710\nEven Microsoft's doing the official one,\nbecause this is not Hyper-V doing it.\n\n588\n00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:15.900\nThis is the iSCSI target.\n\n589\n00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.699\n>> Gotcha.\n>> Because it's got to\n\n590\n00:29:16.699 --> 00:29:18.820\nbe iSCSI compatible, and\nthat's where that comes from.\n\n591\n00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.940\nSo if this were a Linux, or\nWindows, or even Mac OS for\n\n592\n00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.410\nthat matter,\nthey all handle iSCSI the same way.\n\n593\n00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.680\nAnd CHAP's not the strongest\nthing in the world.\n\n594\n00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.660\nThere are certain attacks that\nseem to be waged against CHAP, but\n\n595\n00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.030\nyou should have a dedicated\nstorage network anyway.\n\n596\n00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.650\nSo somebody would have to have physical\naccess to your network to be able to\n\n597\n00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.840\nintercept this stuff and\ntry and break it, right?\n\n598\n00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.490\nAnd if they've already got physical\naccess to your network, believe me,\n\n599\n00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:42.370\nthey can get past the CHAP.\n\n600\n00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.320\nAll they've got to do is just\nrip your hard drives out and go.\n\n601\n00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.090\nSo physical security is always\nsomething we need to be concerned with.\n\n602\n00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:52.140\nCHAP here is just the standard Challenge\nHandshake Authentication Protocol.\n\n603\n00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:56.340\n>> Now if we want to do something like\nmaybe confirm that this is set up,\n\n604\n00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.730\nwe want to find out who is gaining access,\nwhat they're gaining access to,\n\n605\n00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.240\nwe basically want to track\nthese system wide activities.\n\n606\n00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.590\nWe want to know what's\nhappening in our systems.\n\n607\n00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.110\nDo we have a way we can do that as well?\n\n608\n00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.800\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n609\n00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.410\nHold on, I'm on the wrong server.\n\n610\n00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.391\nThat's why I'm not seeing it.\n\n611\n00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:13.666\n[LAUGH] So I showed you earlier here\non this server, there's the virtual\n\n612\n00:30:13.666 --> 00:30:17.010\nhard drive for one of my VMs, or\nthe configuration files are right here.\n\n613\n00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.420\nSo here's the configuration file for\nthat VM.\n\n614\n00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.440\nIf I want to know when somebody\nchanges it, and get notifications and\n\n615\n00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.010\nstuff, we can turn on file auditing.\n\n616\n00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:28.990\nWe talked about auditing and\nCISLogs during the monitoring episode.\n\n617\n00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.700\nWe talked about that already from\nthe standpoint of watching when a server\n\n618\n00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.140\nfailure happens, but\nyou might want to audit things just for\n\n619\n00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.480\na security prospective.\n\n620\n00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.600\nIt's not that the server went down,\nbut that somebody modified it, and\n\n621\n00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.730\nI want to know about it.\n\n622\n00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:44.580\nAnd so at the file level,\nwe can turn on auditing.\n\n623\n00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.840\nIf you take a file and go into security,\n\n624\n00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.920\nnormally we're talking about permissions\nhere, but if I go into advanced,\n\n625\n00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.280\nunder the advanced side you'll see where\nwe can start to configure auditing.\n\n626\n00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.210\nAnd here I can specify hey, I want to\naudit this, and I'm going to add in\n\n627\n00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:03.880\neveryone because I want to know\nwhen anybody touches this file.\n\n628\n00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.830\nI'm not messing around.\n\n629\n00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.140\nI want to know.\n\n630\n00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.680\nI'm going to add in everyone, and\nI'm going to add for modifies and writes.\n\n631\n00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.810\nI might not care about reads.\n\n632\n00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.000\nI might just want to\nknow about the writes.\n\n633\n00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.790\nI want to know when somebody\nchanges this document, or whatever.\n\n634\n00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.970\nAnd when you do modify, they have\nto do the read to do the modify so\n\n635\n00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:21.460\nit gets factored in.\n\n636\n00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.130\nAnd I might just want\nto monitor successes.\n\n637\n00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:23.910\nBe careful with this.\n\n638\n00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.020\nThis can be a trick question\non the exam sometimes.\n\n639\n00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.110\nA lot of people just audit for failures.\n\n640\n00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.750\nRight?\n\n641\n00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.850\nAnd I'll tell you, auditing for failures,\nfor the most part, is a waste of time.\n\n642\n00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.580\nAuditing for successes is what you want.\n\n643\n00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.700\nAnd I know it's counter-intuitive.\n\n644\n00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.610\nA lot of people say, well,\nif somebody tries to get at that data that\n\n645\n00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:40.050\nthey're not supposed to get there,\nI want to know about that.\n\n646\n00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:43.720\nBut when a failure happens,\nthat means your system is working right.\n\n647\n00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.550\nSomebody tried to modify that file,\nand they weren't allowed to, and\n\n648\n00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:47.660\nthey were stopped.\n\n649\n00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.380\nThat's what a failure means,\nand that's good.\n\n650\n00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.850\nThey were stopped.\n\n651\n00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.480\nWhere you need to be worried is if\nsomebody tries to modify data they are not\n\n652\n00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.750\nsupposed to, and they succeed.\n\n653\n00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.940\nThat's a problem.\n\n654\n00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.370\nThat's what we need to know about.\n\n655\n00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:00.789\nSo you always want to monitor successes.\n\n656\n00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.310\nOr you might choose to do both,\nsuccesses and failures.\n\n657\n00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:05.750\nBut you never just want\nto monitor failure.\n\n658\n00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:08.600\nThe only thing you'll learn there is if\nsomebody's trying to brute force you.\n\n659\n00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.390\nSo if you have a massive brute force\nattack, but you don't need to monitor\n\n660\n00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:13.370\nfailures for that, you can just\nsee the extra network activity.\n\n661\n00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.560\nSo really monitoring failure\nis kind of a waste of time.\n\n662\n00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.650\nSo all or successes.\n\n663\n00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.010\nI normally just do successes.\n\n664\n00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.400\nI just want to see when somebody\ntries to modify and it works.\n\n665\n00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.660\nAnd now, when I go to my system logs,\nI'm going to see\n\n666\n00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.900\nanytime somebody successfully modifies,\nor reads, or writes.\n\n667\n00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.600\nNow, reads on a VHD can\nbe pretty excessive, so\n\n668\n00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.790\nI'm going to have to start using filters\nand pay attention to my log sizes.\n\n669\n00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.840\nBut the modifies are what's\nreally important.\n\n670\n00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.590\nAnd if I'm using a monitoring system like\nSolarWinds Network Performance Monitor, or\n\n671\n00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:43.040\nsomething like that,\nthen I can have it set to alert me.\n\n672\n00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.120\nAny time a modify happens\nsend me an alert.\n\n673\n00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.480\nIf it's a read don't bother, but\nif it's a modify, send me an alert,\n\n674\n00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.740\nsend me an email, let me know, and\nI can go and find out what happened.\n\n675\n00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.970\nI want to know who did it.\n>> Definitely and\n\n676\n00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.250\nyou said successes and failures.\n\n677\n00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.860\nI can think of,for instance,\nthe brute force right?\n\n678\n00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.635\nFail, fail, fail, success.\n\n679\n00:32:59.635 --> 00:33:03.470\nI definitely want to monitor that time,\nget some kind of trending analysis,\n\n680\n00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:04.850\nor when it's happening.\n\n681\n00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.200\nIt might help you out find out\nwhat's going on in your systems.\n\n682\n00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.000\nAll right Don, great information.\n\n683\n00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.410\nA lot on storage security.\n\n684\n00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:12.940\nWe touched a little bit,\n\n685\n00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.220\ntouched base on some of the stuff that we\nhad talked about in the previous episodes,\n\n686\n00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.770\nso if any of that's confusing to you,\ngo back and watch those episodes.\n\n687\n00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.770\nBut as for this, Don,\nyou have anything else for us on this one?\n\n688\n00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.210\n>> That's about it on storage security.\n\n689\n00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.610\nDo remember, we have covered pieces\nof this in other episodes, so\n\n690\n00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:27.960\nwe kind of tried to sum it up here.\n\n691\n00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.170\nObviously, it's a big topic.\n\n692\n00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.040\nThere's a lot of stuff you need to know.\n\n693\n00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.630\nJust remember, don't overlook that data\nat rest, and just because a vendor says\n\n694\n00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.970\nthey'll encrypt the data for you,\ndoesn't mean you should trust it, right?\n\n695\n00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.500\nThat's the two lessons from this\nepisodes that are really important.\n\n696\n00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.690\n>> All right, great information here, and\n\n697\n00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.330\nit looks like we've come to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n698\n00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.400\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nwrap it up here at ITProTV.\n\n699\n00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.980\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n700\n00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.090\n>> And I'm Don Pizet.\n\n701\n00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:52.200\n>> And we'll see you

00:00:16.720\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.710\nin today's episode,\nwe're gonna be moving along in Cloud+.\n\n5\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.290\nAnd so far, we've been talking\na lot about securing your data.\n\n6\n00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.930\nWhen it's on the move, and\nwhen it is stationary, right?\n\n7\n00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.760\nWhen it's been parked on our harddrives.\n\n8\n00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.440\nBut now we've got to talk a little bit\nmore about the devices themselves, and\n\n9\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.770\nhow we keep them secure.\n\n10\n00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.290\nSo in this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at system hardening.\n\n11\n00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.220\nAnd we've got out resident professional,\nnone other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.070\nHow you doing, Don?\n\n13\n00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.112\n>> I am doing great, Wes.\n\n14\n00:00:42.112 --> 00:00:43.320\nThank you for having me back on the show.\n\n15\n00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.410\nAnd yeah, in this episode we're gonna\nreally get to that topic that a lot of you\n\n16\n00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.670\nhave been wanting to see.\n\n17\n00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.660\nWhen we deploy a hypervisor as a host and\nvirtual machines as our guests,\n\n18\n00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.030\nthey're rarely deployed in a very\nsecure fashion by default.\n\n19\n00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.120\nWe've got to take steps to make\nsure that we follow proper security\n\n20\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.820\npractices on them.\n\n21\n00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.710\nAnd some vendors are better than others,\nbut\n\n22\n00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.440\nthey all have their faults and weaknesses.\n\n23\n00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.260\nAnd we've got to make sure we take the\nsteps to make sure those systems run as\n\n24\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.410\nsecurely as possible.\n\n25\n00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.220\nAnd they call that\nprocess system hardening.\n\n26\n00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.850\nYou do a default install.\n\n27\n00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.640\nAnd then you perform certain actions to\nincrease the security of those devices.\n\n28\n00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.940\nAnd once that's done, you've got a nice\nsecure system that's up and running.\n\n29\n00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.080\nYou're still at risk, right?\n\n30\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.780\nThere's always that attacker on\nthe outside trying to come in, but\n\n31\n00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.630\nyou've taken the steps to\neliminate all the common threats.\n\n32\n00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.440\nAnd so, now it would take a very\nsophisticated attacker to break\n\n33\n00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.930\ninto your system.\n\n34\n00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.460\nAll right, well, let's just start with\nsome kind of general things that apply to\n\n35\n00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.480\nevery system.\n\n36\n00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.620\nUnderstand that when I talk about\nsystem hardening I'm talking about our\n\n37\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.690\nvirtual machine hosts.\n\n38\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.270\nAnd our guests.\n\n39\n00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.980\nSo on the host side,\nwe might be talking about VMware ESX or\n\n40\n00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.360\nMicrosoft's Hyper-V\nrunning on top of Windows.\n\n41\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.310\nWe might be talking about\nKVM running on top of Linux.\n\n42\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.550\nOr even Citrix XenServer\nrunning on top of Linux also.\n\n43\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.840\nI guess even VMware's Hyper-V\nruns on top of Linux, too.\n\n44\n00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.590\nSo you've got these underlying OSes\n\n45\n00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.980\nthat are involved in running\nthese hypervisor platforms.\n\n46\n00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.790\nAnd those have to be secured.\n\n47\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.400\nAnd then you've got your virtual machines,\n\n48\n00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.150\nwhich are running whatever\nguests you install.\n\n49\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.400\nMaybe Windows, Linux, whatever.\n\n50\n00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.290\nAnd those have to be secured.\n\n51\n00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.000\nAnd when you do the default install,\n\n52\n00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.680\nyou do a default install of Windows for\nexample,\n\n53\n00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.820\nit probably installs extra things that you\ndon't need just to be a Hyper-V server.\n\n54\n00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.630\nOr if you install KVM on top of\na Linux distro like Ubuntu, Ubuntu\n\n55\n00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.760\ninstalls a ton of stuff that you don't\nneed, and we need to get rid of that.\n\n56\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.760\nSo, our basic steps, the generic steps you\nwould apply in any system are first off,\n\n57\n00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.760\nto evaluate exactly what you need.\n\n58\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.290\nWhat do you need to perform this function?\n\n59\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.020\nWhat's the bare minimum resources\nnecessary to be a Hyper-V server, right?\n\n60\n00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.250\nDo I need a graphical user\ninterface on the server?\n\n61\n00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.020\nNo, you can do a core services install of\nWindows, and that eliminates the GUI, and\n\n62\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.250\nInternet Explorer, and\nall that other stuff.\n\n63\n00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.660\nDo you need Notepad on\nyour Hyper-V server?\n\n64\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.190\nNo.\nDo you need Internet Explorer?\n\n65\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.770\nNo.\n\n66\n00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.650\nDo you need a stinking recycle bin?\n\n67\n00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.680\nYou don't need any of that\nstuff on Hyper-V Server.\n\n68\n00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.460\n>> One of the things that I've heard, and\n\n69\n00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.740\nyou've been in this business a very long\ntime, is that 80% of a lot of the updates\n\n70\n00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.385\nthat happen within server\nare related specifically to the GUI.\n\n71\n00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:17.225\n>> Yeah, and Internet Explorer especially.\n\n72\n00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:19.645\nAnd if you're not even gonna use it\nthen just get that thing off of there.\n\n73\n00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:23.395\nIf it's a Hyper V server,\nyou're not downloading software onto it.\n\n74\n00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:26.155\nYou might do that on your desktop, and so\non your desktop you have that stuff, but\n\n75\n00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:27.387\non the server you don't.\n\n76\n00:03:27.387 --> 00:03:31.627\nOn a Linux box, when I'm running KVM, do I\nneed a graphical user interface for that?\n\n77\n00:03:31.627 --> 00:03:35.367\nNo, just do a command line,\ncut out X Windows, cut out Unity,\n\n78\n00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:38.267\nany of that other stuff that you\nmight be running on top of it.\n\n79\n00:03:38.267 --> 00:03:40.675\nYou don't need that junk,\njust get it out of there.\n\n80\n00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:42.927\nSo, we've gotta identify\nsoftware we don't need and\n\n81\n00:03:42.927 --> 00:03:46.230\nremove it, or don't install it in\nthe first place is preferable.\n\n82\n00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.940\nWe also need to identify any services and\nports that we're not using, all right?\n\n83\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.720\nIf I'm a Hyper V server, do I need a web\nserver up and running on my system?\n\n84\n00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.850\nNo, get rid of it,\njust get it off of there.\n\n85\n00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.360\nRight?\n\n86\n00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.780\nYou don't need extra software running on\nthese machines, so you can identify it.\n\n87\n00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.400\nIf you can't remove it,\n\n88\n00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.930\nsometimes there's software that\nyou just can't remove, right?\n\n89\n00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.980\nSo for example, I might have a Citrix\nzen server that it has SSH up and\n\n90\n00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.140\nrunning, and that's it.\n\n91\n00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.790\nIt's just there.\nI can't do anything about it.\n\n92\n00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.200\nIt's gonna run SSH on the host,\nbut I don't want that.\n\n93\n00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.600\nI can still secure it.\n\n94\n00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.750\nI can use a firewall and restrict what\nIPs are allowed to connect to it.\n\n95\n00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.320\nIf I don't wanna use it,\nI can just say no IPs can connect to it.\n\n96\n00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.340\nAnd now I don't have to worry\nabout somebody attacking SSH.\n\n97\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.200\nI wasn't gonna use it anyway.\n\n98\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.880\nIt has to run.\n\n99\n00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.470\nI can't stop it, but\nI can use a firewall to block it.\n\n100\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.910\nAll right, and we can stop that access.\n\n101\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.030\nOne common thing that I like to do,\n\n102\n00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.670\nthere's actually a really\nsimple thing that I like to do.\n\n103\n00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.530\nOn my virtual machine hosts,\n\n104\n00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.740\nwhen I configure the network cards\nI don't set a default gateway.\n\n105\n00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.440\nWhy have a default gateway on\nyour virtual machine host?\n\n106\n00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.550\nIf you have a default gateway so\nyou can access other networks, right?\n\n107\n00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.990\nYour virtual machines might need that.\n\n108\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.640\nYour virtual machines,\nyour other networks need to see.\n\n109\n00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.040\nBut your virtual machine host,\ndoes it need to get out there?\n\n110\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.640\nNo.\nJust don't put a default gateway on there.\n\n111\n00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.670\nNow it can't get out.\n\n112\n00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.610\nOr put it on a dedicated network.\n\n113\n00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.020\nI know I've mentioned\nthis on other episodes,\n\n114\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.890\nthat we can have a network interface\nthat's just for management.\n\n115\n00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.830\nAnd that can be on an out of band,\na separate network, just for management.\n\n116\n00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.580\nAnd now an attacker might be\nable to break into a VM, but\n\n117\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.340\nthey won't be able to\nbreak into that host.\n\n118\n00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.200\nIf they can get into the host, that's when\nthey can reek all sorts of havoc, right?\n\n119\n00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.240\nSo, taking that extra step of just\nisolating the host, does help,\n\n120\n00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.220\nit helps a lot, right?\n\n121\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.530\nSome of the other things we wanna look\nfor, default user names and passwords.\n\n122\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.650\nAll of the systems have default\nusernames and passwords.\n\n123\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.400\nIn Citrix Zen server it's root.\n\n124\n00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.680\nIn Microsoft Windows it's administrator.\n\n125\n00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.080\nThese are default accounts that\nare created when you install the system.\n\n126\n00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.030\nAnd attackers know that.\n\n127\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.600\nThey know the name,\nnow they just have to get the password.\n\n128\n00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.460\nAnd so they can start to guess it,\nright, so get rid of that account.\n\n129\n00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.890\nIf you can get rid of it, do it.\n\n130\n00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.890\nIf you can't,\neither disable the account or rename it.\n\n131\n00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.020\nIn Windows they really don't like you\ndeleting that administrator account.\n\n132\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.790\nBut you can disable it or\nyou can rename it, and\n\n133\n00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.210\nnow an attacker won't know that name.\n\n134\n00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.360\nThey would have to guess that and\n\n135\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.880\nfigure it out, and that's an extra level\nof effort they'd have to go through,\n\n136\n00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.201\nso definitely an action\nyou want to take there.\n\n137\n00:05:59.201 --> 00:06:03.970\nHost-based firewalls,\nWindows has a firewall built into it.\n\n138\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.360\nVMWare DSX has a firewall built into it,\nCitrix XenServer, not so much.\n\n139\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.930\nIt actually does have IP\ntables under the hood but\n\n140\n00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.720\nyou're not allowed to mess with it,\nso it really doesn't have one.\n\n141\n00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.340\nSo you might choose to\ninstall one yourself, or\n\n142\n00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.250\nuse a physical firewall in between\nthat device and the network.\n\n143\n00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.190\nUse a firewall.\n\n144\n00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.270\nFor any services and\nports you can't turn off yourself,\n\n145\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.700\nyou can at least restrict access to them.\n\n146\n00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.320\nAll right.\n\n147\n00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.310\nAnother step,\ninstalling anti-virus if necessary.\n\n148\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.900\nNot everybody needs that but\nif you've got Linux or\n\n149\n00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.990\nWindows servers, they are targets,\nthere is malicious software out there and\n\n150\n00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.860\nso you wanna do scans,\nroutine scans of your system.\n\n151\n00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.020\nWhen we say antivirus it's not\njust traditional signature based\n\n152\n00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.330\nantivirus anymore.\n\n153\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.400\nNow we want host based intrusion\nprevention software, or HIPS, right?\n\n154\n00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.270\nAnd what HIPS can do is it can do\nheuristics and it can look for\n\n155\n00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.540\nattack behaviors and\nstop those before they happen.\n\n156\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.790\nA SQL injection attack is not a virus,\nso antivirus software won't find it.\n\n157\n00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.600\nBut a HIPS software package will\nsee that SQL injection attack and\n\n158\n00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.600\nrecognize it for\nwhat it is and stop it, right.\n\n159\n00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.650\nSo having good software\nin place that does that.\n\n160\n00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.850\nLots of vendors make it, it's usually\nthe traditional antivirus makers\n\n161\n00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.190\nthat make it still, like TrendMicro.\n\n162\n00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.910\nAnd it just does a lot more\nthan virus signature scanning.\n\n163\n00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.500\nPatching the system,\nthis one's really important.\n\n164\n00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.890\nWhen you deploy a virtual machine,\ndon't assume that it's fully up to date.\n\n165\n00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.910\nIf it's Windows you're installing from\na DVD and that DVD might have been printed\n\n166\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.610\nmonths or even years ago, so your system\nis out dated the moment you install it.\n\n167\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.256\nEven when you deploy an image\nin a cloud service like if I go\n\n168\n00:07:32.256 --> 00:07:37.130\ninto Amazon web services and I deploy an\nimage, even that image gets out of date.\n\n169\n00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.850\nLike the current Amazon Linux image,\n\n170\n00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.750\nif I deploy it right now, was actually\nreleased in September of 2015.\n\n171\n00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.480\nIt's about five months old, right?\n\n172\n00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.483\nAnd that means,\nthey usually do one every six months, so\n\n173\n00:07:48.483 --> 00:07:50.291\nthey're about to release\nanother one next month.\n\n174\n00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:52.430\nBut until then,\nwhenever I deploy their image,\n\n175\n00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.419\nthe first thing I need to is patch and\nupdate.\n\n176\n00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:56.230\nAnd not just once.\n\n177\n00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.316\nIt's up to me to continue patching and\nupdating that system and\n\n178\n00:07:59.316 --> 00:08:02.460\nkeeping it updated,\nit's part of hardening that server.\n\n179\n00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.881\nIf I let it get out of date,\nI'm letting vulnerability stay, and\n\n180\n00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:05.944\nthat's a problem, right?\n\n181\n00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:08.451\nAnd then the last general\nstep that I kind of have is\n\n182\n00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:10.440\njust deactivating default accounts.\n\n183\n00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.780\nRemember I mentioned like renaming or\nremoving?\n\n184\n00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.750\nSometimes you can just disable or\ndeactivate, right?\n\n185\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.190\nSo we can kind of cut those out.\n\n186\n00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.500\nAnd then that stops us from functioning.\n\n187\n00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.010\nThe challenge here is,\n\n188\n00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.000\nall those things that I just said\nthey're well and good, right?\n\n189\n00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.310\nThey're great things.\n\n190\n00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.360\nBut, the way you do it is different\non each operating system.\n\n191\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.090\nAnd so, you really need to rely on\nyour operating system vendors to\n\n192\n00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.200\ndo this, right?\n\n193\n00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.581\nSome of them make it really easy.\nSome of them make it kind of hard.\n\n194\n00:08:31.581 --> 00:08:34.310\nLet me just give you some examples.\n\n195\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:37.770\nThe VMware, for example.\n\n196\n00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.790\nIf you have VMware ESX\ndeployed in your environment,\n\n197\n00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.880\nthey have\na VMware Security Hardening Guide.\n\n198\n00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.930\nYou can go right to VMware's website,\nI'll put the link in the show notes, but\n\n199\n00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.750\nit's just\nwww.vmware.com/security/hardening-guides.\n\n200\n00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.733\nAnd they put out hardening guides for\nall of their platforms, vSphere 6.0, 5.5,\n\n201\n00:08:56.733 --> 00:08:57.337\nand back.\n\n202\n00:08:57.337 --> 00:09:01.757\nAnd so I can come in here and I can take\nthe vSphere 6.0 Hardening Guide, and\n\n203\n00:09:01.757 --> 00:09:05.830\nI can jump right in there and\nit's just a PDF that I'll download.\n\n204\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.400\nAnd I can fire that up and\n\n205\n00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.720\nthey will give me the steps and\nadvice to securing this system.\n\n206\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.020\nAnd, you know, I thought it was a PDF,\nthis is actually an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n207\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.925\nAnd so right here it's giving me patches,\naudit exception users,\n\n208\n00:09:20.925 --> 00:09:23.590\nNTP configuration, persistent logs.\n\n209\n00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.670\nIt's telling me things to look for\nin a very very small font.\n\n210\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.260\nAnd then over here it's telling me how\nto detect if there's vulnerabilities for\n\n211\n00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.860\nit, if it's a configuration parameter\nI need to change and so on.\n\n212\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.873\nHow I assess to see if\nthis has been secured?\n\n213\n00:09:35.873 --> 00:09:40.660\nIt's all right here in a guide\nprovided by them, right.\n\n214\n00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.480\nSo they tell me the steps to take for ESX.\n\n215\n00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.720\nMost of the other vendors\ndo the same thing.\n\n216\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.630\nMicrosoft, they have their security guide\nfor Hyper-V in Windows Server 2012, and\n\n217\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.200\nso they go through it.\n\n218\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.436\nYou'll see right here, Chapter 2:\nHardening the Hyper-V host, right?\n\n219\n00:09:54.436 --> 00:09:56.990\nRoles & Delegation,\nProtecting Virtual Machines,\n\n220\n00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.560\nthese are the steps that I would take for\nHyper-V specifically.\n\n221\n00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.180\nHere's what I need to do.\n\n222\n00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.360\nDo a server core install,\nnot a GUI, right?\n\n223\n00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.680\nAnd then it will go in here and\n\n224\n00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.670\ntell you other things like anti-malware\nsoftware in the operating system.\n\n225\n00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.163\nVirtual machine authentication for\nlive migration securing that traffic,\n\n226\n00:10:14.163 --> 00:10:16.212\nsecuring storage and\nthey give you the tips.\n\n227\n00:10:16.212 --> 00:10:20.304\nWMyEncrytpion for management data,\nHyper-V replicas, all the steps I\n\n228\n00:10:20.304 --> 00:10:24.745\nneed to take to secure that system and\nmake sure that it's safe and sound.\n\n229\n00:10:24.745 --> 00:10:26.850\nThe default install doesn't do this stuff.\n\n230\n00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.220\nThe features are there,\nwe have to use them, and\n\n231\n00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.710\nthese guides are how we find that out,\nright?\n\n232\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.470\nSo definitely an important one.\n\n233\n00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.110\nAnother example, Red Hat.\n\n234\n00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.000\nLet's say I deploy Red Hat with KVM on it.\n\n235\n00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.610\nI want that to be my\nvirtualization platform.\n\n236\n00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.290\nVery, very popular, right?\n\n237\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.470\nWhen I do that, they've got their\nvirtualization security guide.\n\n238\n00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.782\nAnd so I can go right on their website,\nand we can read everything they've got,\n\n239\n00:10:47.782 --> 00:10:50.254\nit's written like a stinking novel here,\nand it's free,\n\n240\n00:10:50.254 --> 00:10:51.900\nyou just go to their website and get it.\n\n241\n00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.327\nSo it talks about host security and guest\nsecurity, and they explain the steps for\n\n242\n00:10:56.327 --> 00:10:59.935\nrecommended practices,\nwhat are the best practices for Red Hat?\n\n243\n00:10:59.935 --> 00:11:03.243\nAnd special considerations for\npublic cloud providers.\n\n244\n00:11:03.243 --> 00:11:08.235\nIf I'm deploying Red Hat on AWS,\nthose are the steps that they're taking to\n\n245\n00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:12.920\nsecure that system, but for me I can\nclick on this and jump to that page.\n\n246\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.540\nAnd now we start to get the practices for\nthem right?\n\n247\n00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.180\nEnsure auditing is enabled.\n\n248\n00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.610\nEnsure SELinux is configured properly,\nright?\n\n249\n00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.060\nThat security infrastructure,\nyou've gotta have that.\n\n250\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.360\nEnsure remote management\ntools are restricted.\n\n251\n00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.530\nDon't allow just anybody to get into SSH.\n\n252\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.800\nEnsure the firewall's configured.\n\n253\n00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.550\nRefrain from granting direct access\nto disks or blocked devices.\n\n254\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:37.250\nThey give you the information here,\nyou just have to act on it.\n\n255\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.750\nAnd they go far beyond that.\n\n256\n00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.030\nThey actually do the step-by-step.\n\n257\n00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.863\nHere's how you configure it,\n\n258\n00:11:40.863 --> 00:11:42.440\nyou've just gotta read through\nthe documents to find it.\n\n259\n00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.240\nSo these guys are really essential.\n\n260\n00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.650\nAnd there is one other source.\n\n261\n00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.310\nI know it's a lot less popular these days,\nbut the NSA,\n\n262\n00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.130\nthe National Security Agency,\nthey're spying on you.\n\n263\n00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:57.340\nBut in return for that they also give\nyou a lot of great information for\n\n264\n00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.650\nsecuring your system.\n\n265\n00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.830\nBecause, while they are getting\na bit of a bad rap right now,\n\n266\n00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:06.650\ntheir job is right here, defending our\nnation, securing the future, right.\n\n267\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.800\nThat's what they're trying to do.\n\n268\n00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.640\nAnd helping you defend your servers\nis a part of their mission, right.\n\n269\n00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.170\nAnd so they put out guides that are,\nwhether you like the NSA or\n\n270\n00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.320\nnot, they are really good guides, where\nthey go through and give you information.\n\n271\n00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.331\nThe only problem is they write the guides\nbased on the operating systems the US\n\n272\n00:12:24.331 --> 00:12:26.428\ngovernment uses, and\nthe US government is not fast.\n\n273\n00:12:26.428 --> 00:12:28.675\nSo when Server 2012 came out,\n\n274\n00:12:28.675 --> 00:12:33.610\nit took a few years before the NSA's\nhardening guides came out for it.\n\n275\n00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.610\nBut you'll see like\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux,\n\n276\n00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.120\nthe current version is seven,\ntheir guide is still for version five and\n\n277\n00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.860\nthat's because the US Government\nisn't using the newer versions yet.\n\n278\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.580\nAnd you'll see the same thing for\nother operating systems like Windows,\n\n279\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.430\nwhere they have Windows 7 and Server 2003.\n\n280\n00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.986\nWhere's Server 2008?\nWhere's Server 2012?\n\n281\n00:12:48.986 --> 00:12:50.706\nEventually they'll come out, but\n\n282\n00:12:50.706 --> 00:12:54.030\nagain it's just the government\nis a little bit slow on that.\n\n283\n00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.180\nBut if you're using these,\nwe can jump into like\n\n284\n00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.700\nthe Window Server 2003\nSecurity Guide Addendum, it's an addendum.\n\n285\n00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.960\nThey're saying follow Microsoft\nsecurity guide and then here's some\n\n286\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.300\nextra stuff that we recommend that\nyou might want to look into, right.\n\n287\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.212\nAnd so they lay it out here some\nadditional registry permissions or\n\n288\n00:13:12.212 --> 00:13:13.950\nwhatever they're specifying.\n\n289\n00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.760\nSo, just another good\nresource to reach out to.\n\n290\n00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.870\nJust not necessarily up to date.\n\n291\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.180\nDefinitely go to the vendor first.\n\n292\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.350\nThat's where I normally go.\n\n293\n00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.000\n>> I got a couple questions here Don,\nwhen it comes to system hardening.\n\n294\n00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.620\nAnd the first one I'll let you\nanswer before I ask the second one.\n\n295\n00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.880\nThe first one is related to these guides.\n\n296\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.390\nThere are a ton of settings, and man,\njust seeing you scroll down through there,\n\n297\n00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.460\nthey are a ton of settings.\n\n298\n00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.590\nNot every setting's gonna be\nrelevant to your environment,\n\n299\n00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.020\nso you'll have to look, right?\n\n300\n00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:37.850\n>> Absolutely, yeah,\n\n301\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.682\nbecause sometimes you can break\nfunctionality if you're not careful.\n\n302\n00:13:40.682 --> 00:13:44.100\nYou know there maybe something\nlike SSH that you don't use but\n\n303\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.300\nother people do use.\n\n304\n00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.920\nAnd so that's a different requirement.\n\n305\n00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.620\nYou've got to apply all these against\nwhat you're trying to achieve.\n\n306\n00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.217\n>> I give the example where I\ndid exactly that same thing.\n\n307\n00:13:51.217 --> 00:13:54.490\nI was on the Windows Server 2008\nmachine and I was practicing\n\n308\n00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.652\nthe security configuration wizard and\nI was remoted into it.\n\n309\n00:13:57.652 --> 00:14:01.007\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, I didn't check\noff remote desktop to keep it open.\n\n310\n00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:04.567\nAnd sure enough when it goes through\nits process, it shut me down and\n\n311\n00:14:04.567 --> 00:14:07.250\nthen we had to rely on\ngood old sneakernet.\n\n312\n00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.000\nThe other question that I have,\nis it seems like that you could get,\n\n313\n00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.800\nwith having many different systems or\n\n314\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.730\nmaybe even the same systems all require\nmaybe slightly different configurations,\n\n315\n00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.770\nwhere maybe a security baseline or\na template might come into play for\n\n316\n00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.880\nthis for various roles or\nvarious server configurations.\n\n317\n00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.460\n>> Absolutely,\nyou can build your own server image.\n\n318\n00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.790\nAnd that way when you\nroll out a new server,\n\n319\n00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.060\nit's already configured the way you want.\n\n320\n00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.777\nThe problem with baselines and\ntemplates and\n\n321\n00:14:29.777 --> 00:14:31.414\nimages is they get out\nof date really fast.\n\n322\n00:14:31.414 --> 00:14:33.370\nSo you've gotta maintain them.\n\n323\n00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.438\nAnd then the other thing is is you\nhave a baseline, template, image,\n\n324\n00:14:36.438 --> 00:14:39.988\nthey all work the same, they make sure\nthat you're secure and proper on day one.\n\n325\n00:14:39.988 --> 00:14:43.710\nBut what about day two, day five, day 500?\n\n326\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.500\nWell, maybe one day somebody's in\nthere troubleshooting a problem,\n\n327\n00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.790\nthey turn off the firewall.\n\n328\n00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:48.730\nWell, problem fixed.\n\n329\n00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.790\nThen they walk away and they forget\nto turn the firewall back on or\n\n330\n00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:51.900\nsomething like that?\n\n331\n00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.060\nNow you've deviated from your baseline.\n\n332\n00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.299\nAnd so, we've gotta combine hardening\nthe system on day one with compliance,\n\n333\n00:14:58.299 --> 00:15:02.682\nmonitoring the system to ensure that it\nstays in line with our hardening, right.\n\n334\n00:15:02.682 --> 00:15:04.969\nThat's really critical with\nthese systems we employ them.\n\n335\n00:15:04.969 --> 00:15:09.138\nAll right, so that's kind of some of\nthe basics that you need and the thing\n\n336\n00:15:09.138 --> 00:15:13.930\nthat CompTIA is stressing the most is you\ndefinitely want to check with the vendors.\n\n337\n00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.272\nCheck with the vendors because they give\nyou hardening guides that are, I mean,\n\n338\n00:15:16.272 --> 00:15:17.553\nwho knows their software better than them?\n\n339\n00:15:17.553 --> 00:15:20.660\nAnd then you need to interpret that and\napply it in your environment.\n\n340\n00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.200\nI do want to show you kind of\na real world example though.\n\n341\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.170\nLet's say I'm deploying\nan instance here in Amazon.\n\n342\n00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.468\nSo when I go to launch an instance,\nI'm gonna launch a VM.\n\n343\n00:15:28.468 --> 00:15:31.590\nNow I'm not worrying about the host\nOS here, Amazon takes care of that.\n\n344\n00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:32.990\nI'm worried about my guest.\n\n345\n00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.700\nI'm gonna deploy an Amazon Linux\nvirtual machine, right.\n\n346\n00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.120\nAnd when I look at it,\nyou can see the date on this AMI.\n\n347\n00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.502\nSee how it's dated 2015.09.2, right.\n\n348\n00:15:41.502 --> 00:15:42.950\nSo this is dated from September.\n\n349\n00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.075\nAnd they normally do\nthem every six months.\n\n350\n00:15:44.075 --> 00:15:48.439\nSo there's gonna be a 3 2016\ncoming out soon, right.\n\n351\n00:15:48.439 --> 00:15:49.461\nWe're in February, so\nit'll be coming out soon.\n\n352\n00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:51.734\nBut until then I've\ngotta deploy this image.\n\n353\n00:15:51.734 --> 00:15:54.877\nAnd this image is slowly\ngetting out of date, and\n\n354\n00:15:54.877 --> 00:15:59.026\nAmazon does do updates on it\nperiodically but not often enough.\n\n355\n00:15:59.026 --> 00:16:04.580\nAnd so when we deploy that it\nmay already be out of date.\n\n356\n00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.220\nOkay.\nSo\n\n357\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.980\nthat's the first thing I need to remember.\n\n358\n00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.110\nThen when I start to deploy it,\nas I configure my instance,\n\n359\n00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.780\nI'm specifying things like my network and\n\n360\n00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.120\nmy subnet which can help to isolate\nthis machine or to make it public.\n\n361\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.180\nI have to choose whether\nI want to do that.\n\n362\n00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.120\nMaybe I don't want it to have a public IP,\nso I can disable that option.\n\n363\n00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.230\nI need to keep that in mind when I'm\ndeploying these systems, all right?\n\n364\n00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.580\nMy storage, when I deploy the storage, by\ndefault, Amazon's gonna create storage and\n\n365\n00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.080\nit's not encrypted.\n\n366\n00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.290\nSo I might choose to encrypt that storage\nto add an extra level of security.\n\n367\n00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:38.830\nWe talked about that back on\nthe storage encryption side, episode.\n\n368\n00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.800\nI'll give it a name.\n\n369\n00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.440\nName is not really based on security.\n\n370\n00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.995\nI guess it helps you not screw up and\npick the wrong server, so\n\n371\n00:16:43.995 --> 00:16:46.840\nwe'll call security from that perspective.\n\n372\n00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.930\nThen my security group,\nthis is important, right?\n\n373\n00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.210\nThis is the firewall.\n\n374\n00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.290\nAnd Amazon gives me a very\nrestricted firewall by default.\n\n375\n00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:59.470\nThey're basically saying, for this system,\nwhich is going to be ITProTV-wb02,\n\n376\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.770\nthat they're just going to\nallow SSH from anywhere and\n\n377\n00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.500\nI don't necessarily want\nit from anywhere right?\n\n378\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.440\nI want it from me.\n\n379\n00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.360\nI'm the one that's managing this thing,\nso I might want to change that and\n\n380\n00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.520\nsay it's just my IP, only I can get to it\nvia SSH, but if it's going to be a web\n\n381\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.740\nserver, I'll probably want to add HTTP for\neverybody else.\n\n382\n00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.330\nI want to let the rest of\nthe world to get to it and\n\n383\n00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.250\nI'll probably need to do HTTPS also.\n\n384\n00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.220\nIf we're doing secure\ncommunications right?\n\n385\n00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.690\nSo I'm now choosing the traffic\nthat's allowed to get to it.\n\n386\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.710\nNow this is just inbound traffic.\n\n387\n00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.880\nThere's outbound traffic also, and\nthe Wizard won't let me fix that.\n\n388\n00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.320\nIf I wanna set outbound filters,\n\n389\n00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.650\nI've gotta finish this Wizard, deploy the\nmachine and then edit the security group.\n\n390\n00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.270\nThat just shows you that while Amazon is\ndoing good security practices here in\n\n391\n00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.880\nthe wizard, there may be more that we\nneed to do that goes beyond the wizard.\n\n392\n00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.840\nSo don't assume this wizard is gonna\ngive you a perfectly secure machine\n\n393\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.190\nright from day one,\nyou may have to do more, right?\n\n394\n00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.740\nSo I'll go to review and launch and\nwe'll launch that machine up.\n\n395\n00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.300\nNow here's the best part.\n\n396\n00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.150\nOn a Linux machine, you typically have\na username and a password, right?\n\n397\n00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.050\nand when you log in, you log in\nwith a username and a password, but\n\n398\n00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.970\ncertificates are more secure.\n\n399\n00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.360\nA lot of people don't use them\nbecause they're hard to set up,\n\n400\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.890\nAmazon's setting it up for me.\n\n401\n00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:11.030\nSo right here, they're gonna give me\na certificate authentication, and\n\n402\n00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.310\nI've already got a certificate I'm\nusing here, itprotv-admin, but\n\n403\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.266\nyou could generate a brand new one.\n\n404\n00:18:16.266 --> 00:18:20.180\nIf you wanted to have a unique certificate\njust for logging in to this system and\n\n405\n00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.470\nthey'll set it up for you.\n\n406\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.430\nThat takes away a lot of that burden.\n\n407\n00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.770\nI'm gonna go ahead and let them do that.\n\n408\n00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.004\nAnd I'll launch the Instance.\n\n409\n00:18:27.004 --> 00:18:30.945\n>> And this if I understand right, so\nyou're saying they're gonna give you,\n\n410\n00:18:30.945 --> 00:18:35.530\nbasically the benefits of a PKI and you\ndon't have to manage the infrastructure.\n\n411\n00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:36.880\n>> That's right.\n>> That's really beneficial.\n\n412\n00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.230\n>> Yeah, cuz that's the main reason\npeople don't deploy the stuff.\n\n413\n00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:40.790\nThey're like I don't wanna set\nup a whole infrastructure.\n\n414\n00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:41.420\nIt's a pain in the butt.\n\n415\n00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.070\nLet me just do username and\npassword, right.\n\n416\n00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.730\nThey're trying to take that away, so\nAmazon's really helping you here.\n\n417\n00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:46.780\nYour environment may not do that.\n\n418\n00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.640\nIf you're responsible for the VM itself,\nyou may need to get in there and\n\n419\n00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.980\nadd certificates and set it up.\n\n420\n00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.380\nAnd you don't need a CA to do this.\n\n421\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.770\nYou can do self-sign certs.\n\n422\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.640\nBut it still takes a lot of work.\n\n423\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.950\nNow if I do Windows,\nWindows doesn't support certificates for\n\n424\n00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.250\nauthentication, so it is going\nto use a username and password.\n\n425\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:06.410\nSo when I deploy that Windows VM and\nI start running through this Wizard.\n\n426\n00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:07.620\nLet me make that one a little bit bigger,\n\n427\n00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.560\ncuz Windows doesn't like to\nrun on the small instances.\n\n428\n00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.140\nSo when I start to go through and deploy\nthis, I can come in and add storage,\n\n429\n00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:14.960\nwhatever it is that I need.\n\n430\n00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.960\nI can still choose encryption,\njust like before.\n\n431\n00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.058\nI can give it a name.\n\n432\n00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:21.790\nI'll do itprotv-web03,\nit's gonna be another web server.\n\n433\n00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.390\nI can give it a security group.\n\n434\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.580\nAnd on this one, since it's Windows,\nthey don't bother with SSH.\n\n435\n00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.320\nInstead they allow\nRemote Desktop Protocol.\n\n436\n00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.990\nSo you RDP into manage this one.\n\n437\n00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.700\nAnd I'll go ahead and launch that.\n\n438\n00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.640\nNow when I launch it,\nit's asking me for a key pair.\n\n439\n00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.670\nBut Windows doesn't support keys, do they?\n\n440\n00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:44.740\nSo what the heck is this?\n\n441\n00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.340\nHow does this work?\n\n442\n00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.480\nWell what they're gonna do is they're\ngonna generate an administrator password\n\n443\n00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.120\nfor me and they're gonna encrypt it.\n\n444\n00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.820\nAnd the only way I can view that\npassword is if I have this key, right?\n\n445\n00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.730\nIt's kind of a false\nsense of security though,\n\n446\n00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.470\nbecause there is still a default\nuser with a password on the system.\n\n447\n00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.530\nThey're just encrypting it for\nme to get it.\n\n448\n00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.030\nOther people could still\nbrute force it and guess it.\n\n449\n00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.390\nIt's almost impossible to\nbrute force a certificate, but\n\n450\n00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.450\na password can be brute force.\n\n451\n00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.450\nSo this is a bit of\na false level of security.\n\n452\n00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:14.090\nSo again, we have to understand\nthe implications of what's being done.\n\n453\n00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.670\nAll right.\n\n454\n00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.230\nThat Window's machine gonna\nlaunch in the background and\n\n455\n00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.720\nso if I go to my instances and\ntake that one\n\n456\n00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.160\nI can't log into it right now cuz I\ndon't know the administrator password.\n\n457\n00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.370\nBut if I go up to actions and,\nwait it's not actions.\n\n458\n00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.280\nI have to wait for\nthe connect button to light up.\n\n459\n00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.203\nOnce it boots up,\nI can hit that connect button and\n\n460\n00:20:31.203 --> 00:20:35.420\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna say\nprovide me a copy of that certificate and\n\n461\n00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.100\nI'll show you what the password is.\n\n462\n00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.810\nAnd if I give it my certificate,\nit'll show me the password and\n\n463\n00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.280\nthen I can log in.\n\n464\n00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.570\nBut I need to change that\npassword as soon as I can.\n\n465\n00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.140\nAnd even better, that administrator\naccount, I need to disable or\n\n466\n00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.660\nrename it as soon as I can, right?\n\n467\n00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.360\nAnd I'm not gonna wait on these machines.\n\n468\n00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.180\nI've got another one sitting here\nthat I'm gonna remote into and\n\n469\n00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.700\nkinda show you that process.\n\n470\n00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.790\nSo this is a Linux machine that I\nspun up and I'm gonna connect to it.\n\n471\n00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.750\nNow they've already set it up for\nme to use a certificate to get into it, so\n\n472\n00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.540\nthat's great, right?\n\n473\n00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.280\nIt's something that would otherwise\nbe difficult, they've made easy for\n\n474\n00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:06.790\nme, right?\n\n475\n00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:11.220\nSo if I wanna jump in and\nsee that, you know,\n\n476\n00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.610\nmy prompt is insanely long in this system,\nso I'm halfway across the screen.\n\n477\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.720\nLet me, how do you change\nyour prompt on this thing?\n\n478\n00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.680\nIt's [LAUGH] here,\nwe'll just say, it's my prompt.\n\n479\n00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:24.096\nThere we go.\n\n480\n00:21:24.096 --> 00:21:25.044\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n481\n00:21:25.044 --> 00:21:25.610\n>> All right,\n\n482\n00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:29.420\nso I want us all to be able to,\nkinda, read what I'm doing here.\n\n483\n00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:34.260\nSo, basically I've got that\ncertificate right here, and\n\n484\n00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:39.550\nI'm gonna SSH into that server\nwith that certificate, all right.\n\n485\n00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.450\nAnd when I log in, even though they've\ndone a certificate, there still has to be\n\n486\n00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:48.030\na user name and Amazon uses\na default username of ec2-user.\n\n487\n00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.218\nAnd so when somebody spins\nup a Linux box in Amazon,\n\n488\n00:21:51.218 --> 00:21:55.240\nyou can expect there to be a user\naccount called the ec2-user.\n\n489\n00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.321\nIf somebody spins up\na server that's Windows,\n\n490\n00:21:57.321 --> 00:22:00.330\nyou can expect there to\nan account called administrator.\n\n491\n00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.080\nIf somebody spins up Linux, you can assume\nthere's gonna be an account called root.\n\n492\n00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.760\nThose are things that we can assume and\nthe attackers know it too.\n\n493\n00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.450\nAnd that's something that\nwe might want to change.\n\n494\n00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.820\nNow, I'm remoting in and it's asking me to\nverify my fingerprint for that certificate\n\n495\n00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.030\nand so, it's my certificate so I know it's\ntrustworthy, but you could verify this\n\n496\n00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.910\nfingerprint against your actual\ncertificate to make sure it's right.\n\n497\n00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.840\nAnd then, you're in.\n\n498\n00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.800\nSo now I'm into that box,\nright, here I am.\n\n499\n00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.370\nIt's warning me that there's\nalready an update available.\n\n500\n00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.430\nThey're telling me, hey Don,\nyou really need a new update.\n\n501\n00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:36.300\nThere's actually 102 updates,\n24 of which are security related.\n\n502\n00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.850\nI need to do my updates!\n\n503\n00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:45.210\nSo right here on day one, the first\nthing I need to do is an update, right?\n\n504\n00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.320\nAnd it's gonna check for\nupdates, and there they all go.\n\n505\n00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.200\nAnd now I can apply my updates, all right?\n\n506\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.020\nAnd that'll protect me for day one.\n\n507\n00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.940\nI'm gonna stop it cuz I don't wanna\nwaste a ton of time doing updates.\n\n508\n00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.230\nBut, I shouldn't say wasting time.\n\n509\n00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.130\nIt's definitely not a waste.\n\n510\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:05.570\nBut I can do those updates, and once\nthe updates are done, I'm safe for a day.\n\n511\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.090\nMore updates come out tomorrow or\nthe next day or the next week.\n\n512\n00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.970\nI need to continually do those updates.\n\n513\n00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:11.270\nThat's an ongoing thing.\n\n514\n00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.520\nBut as part of hardening,\nit's definitely a part of that process.\n\n515\n00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:19.290\nThe next thing I need to do is disable\nany services that I don't need, right?\n\n516\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.140\nThere's a lot of services\nthat run on a Linux box.\n\n517\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:27.590\nIf I run a services-status-all,\n\n518\n00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.120\nyou can see all these different things\nthat are running in the background.\n\n519\n00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.990\nAnd some of these I really need,\nsome of them I don't.\n\n520\n00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.890\nNotice I have the NFS demon.\n\n521\n00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:35.620\nLook, it's stopped.\n\n522\n00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.820\nI guess there's at least that.\n\n523\n00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.820\nI'm not going to use NFS on this server,\nso I don't need it.\n\n524\n00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.160\nAnd here it is.\n\n525\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.620\nIt at least stops so\nI don't have to worry about.\n\n526\n00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.680\nBut if I saw it was running,\nI might want to stop it.\n\n527\n00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.550\nHey, I don't need it.\n\n528\n00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:45.550\nLet me just stop that service.\n\n529\n00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.570\nNo sense in running it.\n\n530\n00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:49.280\nI might even choose to\nuninstall it entirely.\n\n531\n00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.647\nOr I might just leave it there stopped,\nand make sure I don't allow NFS traffic on\n\n532\n00:23:52.647 --> 00:23:55.286\nmy firewall, which is exactly\nhow I'm configured right now.\n\n533\n00:23:55.286 --> 00:23:58.140\nSo you may need some of this,\nyou may not need some of this.\n\n534\n00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.875\nThis one is actually really streamlined.\n\n535\n00:23:59.875 --> 00:24:02.635\nIf you look at that service list,\nthat is a small service list.\n\n536\n00:24:02.635 --> 00:24:07.262\nSo I'm actually good with the bulk of\nthis, well actually pretty much all of it.\n\n537\n00:24:07.262 --> 00:24:08.762\nSo there's not much to tweak.\n\n538\n00:24:08.762 --> 00:24:11.009\nWhen you deploy a full install of Ubuntu,\nthough,\n\n539\n00:24:11.009 --> 00:24:14.161\nyou might have a hundred services here,\nhalf of which you don't need.\n\n540\n00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:17.202\nAnd you can go through and\ndisable those all right?\n\n541\n00:24:17.202 --> 00:24:18.804\nSo I'm pretty good there.\n\n542\n00:24:18.804 --> 00:24:21.254\nThe user account.\n\n543\n00:24:21.254 --> 00:24:22.763\nI guess the user account's the next thing.\n\n544\n00:24:22.763 --> 00:24:26.342\nIf I want to get rid of this ec2-user or\nrename the ec2-user or\n\n545\n00:24:26.342 --> 00:24:30.144\nwhatever it is that I wanna do,\nI can go through and do that, right?\n\n546\n00:24:30.144 --> 00:24:33.678\nI'm gonna throw in a lot of administrator\ncommands, so I'm gonna cheat a little bit.\n\n547\n00:24:33.678 --> 00:24:36.230\nNormally, when you run the administrator\ncommand, you say sudo and\n\n548\n00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.374\nthen whatever the command is.\n\n549\n00:24:37.374 --> 00:24:40.368\nBut I don't wanna type sudo over and\nover and over again.\n\n550\n00:24:40.368 --> 00:24:43.356\nSo I'm gonna cheat and\nget me a root shell.\n\n551\n00:24:43.356 --> 00:24:47.426\nSo I'm just gonna say sudo/bin/bash and\nthere we go.\n\n552\n00:24:47.426 --> 00:24:50.760\nNow if I do a who am I,\nsee how I'm logged in as root?\n\n553\n00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.810\nThere's a root user on this system.\n\n554\n00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.726\nI didn't create the root user, it's there\nby default and the attackers know that.\n\n555\n00:24:55.726 --> 00:25:00.071\nNow by default, root is not allowed to\nSSHN so they can't remotely use it.\n\n556\n00:25:00.071 --> 00:25:01.430\nThey would have to do what I did.\n\n557\n00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:05.254\nLogin with a regular user, and\nthen promote yourself to root.\n\n558\n00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:07.644\nBut they know there's\nan ec2-user account also.\n\n559\n00:25:07.644 --> 00:25:09.286\nSo they already know a regular user.\n\n560\n00:25:09.286 --> 00:25:10.888\nThey just have to figure out its password.\n\n561\n00:25:10.888 --> 00:25:12.297\nWell ec2-user,\nhere's a neat little secret.\n\n562\n00:25:12.297 --> 00:25:13.786\nIt doesn't have a password.\n\n563\n00:25:13.786 --> 00:25:14.610\nIt's got no password!\n\n564\n00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:21.360\nIf we look inside of etc/password, and\nwe find ec2-user, I've got a little x for\n\n565\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.982\nthe password which is what tells me\nthat it's an encrypted password.\n\n566\n00:25:26.982 --> 00:25:31.644\nIf we look inside of the shadow file and\nwe go in here and we find ec2-user,\n\n567\n00:25:31.644 --> 00:25:35.790\nit's gonna have an encrypted password,\nexcept for it doesn't.\n\n568\n00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.893\nIt just has these exclamation points.\n\n569\n00:25:37.893 --> 00:25:39.495\nI keep scrolling my window,\nbut here it is.\n\n570\n00:25:39.495 --> 00:25:43.290\nThese exclamation points that tells me\nit really just doesn't have a password.\n\n571\n00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.543\nHow does it not know the password?\n\n572\n00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:47.870\nBecause it's got certificate\nauthentication turned on.\n\n573\n00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.592\nIt's authenticating with\na certificate not a password.\n\n574\n00:25:50.592 --> 00:25:52.129\nIf you don't have the cert,\nyou can't connect.\n\n575\n00:25:52.129 --> 00:25:56.273\nAnd brute forcing a cert is\nfeasibly impossible, today.\n\n576\n00:25:56.273 --> 00:25:58.166\nIt'll be feasibly impossible\n50 years from now.\n\n577\n00:25:58.166 --> 00:26:00.047\nBut eventually it'll become realistic.\n\n578\n00:26:00.047 --> 00:26:03.862\nBut somebody compromising\nthe certificate is more realistic.\n\n579\n00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:05.250\nAll right, so I'm pretty safe.\n\n580\n00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:08.751\nI could leave it the way that it is but\nif I want to rename that ec2-user.\n\n581\n00:26:08.751 --> 00:26:11.255\nThere’s not really a good way to\nrename it cuz I'm logged in as it.\n\n582\n00:26:11.255 --> 00:26:12.590\nIt's the only user account I've got.\n\n583\n00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:15.886\nYou can't rename an account if\nyou're logged in as that account.\n\n584\n00:26:15.886 --> 00:26:18.845\nSo instead I need to create\na new account for me, right?\n\n585\n00:26:18.845 --> 00:26:22.720\nSo I'm gonna add a user called dpezet.\n\n586\n00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.456\nSo I'm gonna create a user account for me.\n\n587\n00:26:24.456 --> 00:26:26.630\nAnd I need to set a password for\nthat user.\n\n588\n00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:28.681\nWell, if I'm gonna use\npassword authentication,\n\n589\n00:26:28.681 --> 00:26:31.256\nmaybe I don't wanna use password\nauthentication for me either.\n\n590\n00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:34.291\nI'm gonna use certificate authentication.\n\n591\n00:26:34.291 --> 00:26:38.800\nThat ec2-user, it's using my certificate,\nmy IT pro admin certificate, right?\n\n592\n00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.550\nI had to pick that during the install.\n\n593\n00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.219\nSo I can just copy that certificate\nfrom ec2-user over to me.\n\n594\n00:26:43.219 --> 00:26:45.494\nAnd then I can get rid of the ec2 user.\n\n595\n00:26:45.494 --> 00:26:48.435\nAnd now I'm still authenticated\nwith my admin certificate, and\n\n596\n00:26:48.435 --> 00:26:49.834\nit's my own account, right?\n\n597\n00:26:49.834 --> 00:26:51.041\nSo let me do that.\n\n598\n00:26:51.041 --> 00:26:55.960\nIf I, let's see I probably need to create.\n\n599\n00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.624\nInside of every user's home directory,\nyou store your ssh certificates, and\n\n600\n00:27:00.624 --> 00:27:03.278\nyou store it in a little\nfolder called .ssh.\n\n601\n00:27:03.278 --> 00:27:05.534\nAnd if the users never login with ssh,\nthey're not gonna have that.\n\n602\n00:27:05.534 --> 00:27:07.890\nSo, I'm just gonna make\nthat directory real quick.\n\n603\n00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.559\nAnd then what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna copy\n\n604\n00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:17.826\nthe ec2-user certificate\nwhich is stored in the,\n\n605\n00:27:17.826 --> 00:27:21.775\nmy head is gonna cover this up a bit, but\n\n606\n00:27:21.775 --> 00:27:25.621\nit's /home/ec2-user/.ssh.\n\n607\n00:27:25.621 --> 00:27:26.618\nThat's the folder.\n\n608\n00:27:26.618 --> 00:27:29.176\nAnd then /authorized_keys right?\n\n609\n00:27:29.176 --> 00:27:32.498\nSo, there's that authorized key, and\n\n610\n00:27:32.498 --> 00:27:36.603\nI'm gonna copy that file\ninto my home directory,\n\n611\n00:27:36.603 --> 00:27:40.720\ninto dpezet and\nwhy is my word-wrap not working?\n\n612\n00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.780\nOkay, we'll just kind of fenagle this.\n\n613\n00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.335\nI will get this on the screen somehow.\n\n614\n00:27:45.335 --> 00:27:48.805\nSo I'm going to copy that into,\nI just can't win.\n\n615\n00:27:48.805 --> 00:27:50.825\nIt’s just killing me here guys.\n\n616\n00:27:50.825 --> 00:27:55.220\nJust let me,\nI see it's my font size is all jacked up.\n\n617\n00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.153\nAll right, there we go.\n\n618\n00:27:56.153 --> 00:28:00.113\nSo I'm gonna copy it into the dpezet\nhome directory, into .ssh,\n\n619\n00:28:00.113 --> 00:28:04.427\nand what that's going to do is it's\ngoing to copy the authorized keys for\n\n620\n00:28:04.427 --> 00:28:06.207\nthe ec2-user into dpezet.\n\n621\n00:28:06.207 --> 00:28:07.113\nThat's my key.\n\n622\n00:28:07.113 --> 00:28:10.759\nThat’s my certificate, so\nI'm just copying it over so I'll have it.\n\n623\n00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:13.603\nThen I need to make sure that my\nuser will be able to access that.\n\n624\n00:28:13.603 --> 00:28:15.860\nSo I need to reset some\npermissions real quick.\n\n625\n00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:22.050\nI'm gonna do some change ownership of\nmy home directory to put that back.\n\n626\n00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:26.550\nSo this is gonna change ownership of\nthe directory for not just me, but\n\n627\n00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.830\nall the subfolders under me and really\nthe only one I messed with was .ssh.\n\n628\n00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.240\nSo I can get that one and\n\n629\n00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.580\nchange it's ownership, and then I just\nneed to change some permissions on it.\n\n630\n00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.806\nSo I'm gonna change some\npermissions on the .ssh folder so\n\n631\n00:28:38.806 --> 00:28:41.350\nthat again I'll have access to it.\n\n632\n00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.200\nWhoops, there we go.\n\n633\n00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.900\nAnd I need to change permissions\non the certificate, itself.\n\n634\n00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.245\nNow, if you're wondering how I\nhave all these commands memorized,\n\n635\n00:28:49.245 --> 00:28:50.628\nI have actually done them a lot of times.\n\n636\n00:28:50.628 --> 00:28:52.780\nAnd so most of them I do have memorized.\n\n637\n00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.952\nBut typically, you create a hardening\nguide, and you write these steps down so\n\n638\n00:28:55.952 --> 00:28:58.744\nthat every time you deploy a new server,\nyou can follow these steps and\n\n639\n00:28:58.744 --> 00:29:00.142\nget it set up the way that you want.\n\n640\n00:29:00.142 --> 00:29:01.141\nAnd it's consistent, right.\n\n641\n00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:04.487\nThis is part of your hardening policy,\nand so you want to make sure you do that.\n\n642\n00:29:04.487 --> 00:29:07.000\nAnd I do actually have my steps\nwritten down so that I don't forget.\n\n643\n00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.752\nSo I'm gonna write this one out, looking\nat the actual authorized keys file.\n\n644\n00:29:12.752 --> 00:29:14.820\nI'm just kind of changing\nthe permissions of it.\n\n645\n00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.037\nAnd again, my pad is big.\n\n646\n00:29:17.037 --> 00:29:17.815\nSo there we go.\n\n647\n00:29:17.815 --> 00:29:19.858\n[LAUGH] So I'm gonna change that,\nand now I've got that authorized.\n\n648\n00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:21.239\nI've got those permissions set.\n\n649\n00:29:21.239 --> 00:29:24.466\nThe only other thing I need\nto do is when dpezet logs in,\n\n650\n00:29:24.466 --> 00:29:26.440\nthat's just a regular old user.\n\n651\n00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.890\nI need it to have permission\nto use the sudo command.\n\n652\n00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.181\nAnd so I'm gonna run visudo.\n\n653\n00:29:32.181 --> 00:29:38.080\nAnd in here we can find where we can\nauthorize people to run the sudo command.\n\n654\n00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.358\nAnd so I'm gonna come in and\n\n655\n00:29:39.358 --> 00:29:42.260\nfind that little section in here\nwhere we have user accounts.\n\n656\n00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.511\nIt is buried right there.\n\n657\n00:29:44.511 --> 00:29:47.068\nAnd here we can see where the root\nuser has permission you sudo.\n\n658\n00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:50.623\nI'm gonna just insert my own account, and\n\n659\n00:29:50.623 --> 00:29:55.671\nI'm gonna give myself access\nto all commands from any host.\n\n660\n00:29:55.671 --> 00:29:57.705\nSo when I remote in,\nit doesn't matter what client I'm on.\n\n661\n00:29:57.705 --> 00:29:59.190\nI'll be able to run these.\n\n662\n00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:02.200\nAnd if I just leave it like this.\n\n663\n00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.582\nI can use the sudo command.\n\n664\n00:30:03.582 --> 00:30:06.347\nBut when you run sudo,\nit's gonna prompt you for a password.\n\n665\n00:30:06.347 --> 00:30:07.370\nWhat's my password?\n\n666\n00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:08.844\nI don't have one.\n\n667\n00:30:08.844 --> 00:30:10.666\nI'm using certificate authentication.\n\n668\n00:30:10.666 --> 00:30:12.364\nSo if you're using\ncertificate authentication,\n\n669\n00:30:12.364 --> 00:30:14.068\nyou can't provide a password,\nand that's good.\n\n670\n00:30:14.068 --> 00:30:15.786\nThat means somebody can't\nguess your password.\n\n671\n00:30:15.786 --> 00:30:19.165\nBut it also means that I need to\nadd one little extra entry here.\n\n672\n00:30:19.165 --> 00:30:25.492\nInstead of just saying ALL,\nI need to say NOPASSWD:ALL.\n\n673\n00:30:25.492 --> 00:30:29.020\nAnd that means I can run all commands\nwithout providing a password because I\n\n674\n00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.425\nhave a certificate instead.\n\n675\n00:30:30.425 --> 00:30:32.155\nAnd I know some people\nare looking at us like, ooh,\n\n676\n00:30:32.155 --> 00:30:34.581\nsomebody could log in as you and\nthey could start to run these commands!\n\n677\n00:30:34.581 --> 00:30:37.031\nWell, I got a certificate anyway.\n\n678\n00:30:37.031 --> 00:30:39.284\nAnd so if they've logged in as me,\nthey've already got my certificate.\n\n679\n00:30:39.284 --> 00:30:42.649\nSo it doesn't really matter if I prompt or\nnot, they've already got my certificate.\n\n680\n00:30:42.649 --> 00:30:46.225\nIf they're able to get in, so\nthis is perfectly safe for this account.\n\n681\n00:30:46.225 --> 00:30:51.376\nOnce all that is done okay, I can get out.\n\n682\n00:30:51.376 --> 00:30:52.734\nI'm gonna get out of this system.\n\n683\n00:30:52.734 --> 00:30:55.376\nAll right, so\nI'm completely closed out of the system.\n\n684\n00:30:55.376 --> 00:30:59.180\nAnd now, assuming I did it right, [LAUGH]\nthere's always that chance I did it wrong.\n\n685\n00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.177\nI should be able to\nremote in by myself okay?\n\n686\n00:31:02.177 --> 00:31:05.707\nAnd you know I purposely picked Linux\nhere, cuz it’s harder in Linux.\n\n687\n00:31:05.707 --> 00:31:07.721\nAnd in windows, you just create\na new account for yourself,\n\n688\n00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:09.828\nlogin as yourself and\ndelete the old one, and then that’s it.\n\n689\n00:31:09.828 --> 00:31:10.548\nIt's super easy.\n\n690\n00:31:10.548 --> 00:31:12.509\nBut in Linux, this is a lot of work.\n\n691\n00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:16.154\nBut now I should be able to\nremote in as me, and here we go.\n\n692\n00:31:16.154 --> 00:31:18.674\nAnd if I do a whoami,\nI'm logged in as dpezet.\n\n693\n00:31:18.674 --> 00:31:25.930\nAnd more importantly, I can do a sudo and\nrun a command, I'm able to do it.\n\n694\n00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.832\nAnd so\nI now have root access to this system.\n\n695\n00:31:28.832 --> 00:31:30.248\nI can administer it.\n\n696\n00:31:30.248 --> 00:31:33.972\nAnd now if I want,\nI could rename the ec2-user account,\n\n697\n00:31:33.972 --> 00:31:38.767\nif I wanted to keep it around or I'm\ngonna get rid of the darn thing, right?\n\n698\n00:31:38.767 --> 00:31:44.632\nSo I can do a sudo, useerdel-r to get\nrid of it's home directory and stuff.\n\n699\n00:31:44.632 --> 00:31:46.025\nAnd I'll just say ec2- user.\n\n700\n00:31:46.025 --> 00:31:47.489\nIt's gone.\n\n701\n00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:48.928\nNow there's no ec2-user.\n\n702\n00:31:48.928 --> 00:31:53.147\nSo hackers know that the default Amazon\nimage has an account called ec2-user.\n\n703\n00:31:53.147 --> 00:31:54.727\nMine is gone, right.\n\n704\n00:31:54.727 --> 00:31:58.953\nThis can interfere with Amazon's\nability to manage your machine.\n\n705\n00:31:58.953 --> 00:32:00.472\nBut that could be a good thing, right.\n\n706\n00:32:00.472 --> 00:32:03.445\nAmazon has visibility inside\nof your VM by default.\n\n707\n00:32:03.445 --> 00:32:07.427\nBy removing the ec2-user, you also remove\ntheir ability to get into it right?\n\n708\n00:32:07.427 --> 00:32:09.910\nSo as a result, you might not want that.\n\n709\n00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.871\nYou might wanna make it where\nthis ec2- user can't SSH in.\n\n710\n00:32:12.871 --> 00:32:15.959\nAnd that way Amazon still has visibility\nthrough their hardware drivers, but they\n\n711\n00:32:15.959 --> 00:32:19.105\nwouldn't be able to SSH in, and that stops\nattackers from being able to exploit it.\n\n712\n00:32:19.105 --> 00:32:20.905\nSo there's a few other options\nthat you can go through there.\n\n713\n00:32:20.905 --> 00:32:24.585\nBut here I've just killed it off, and\nI'm okay with that, cuz I'm logged in now.\n\n714\n00:32:24.585 --> 00:32:28.166\nAnd so I can start to do my updates and\nall that, and\n\n715\n00:32:28.166 --> 00:32:31.163\nI don't need that user account anymore.\n\n716\n00:32:31.163 --> 00:32:31.872\nSo there we go.\n\n717\n00:32:31.872 --> 00:32:33.264\nNow I'm applying my updates and\nI can start to manage the system.\n\n718\n00:32:33.264 --> 00:32:36.240\nSo every system is a little bit different.\n\n719\n00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.992\nThis is an example right here\nof hardening one system.\n\n720\n00:32:38.992 --> 00:32:40.107\nYour's is definitely\ngoing to be different.\n\n721\n00:32:40.107 --> 00:32:41.128\nDefinitely read the guides.\n\n722\n00:32:41.128 --> 00:32:42.753\nTake advantage of\nthe information's that's out there.\n\n723\n00:32:42.753 --> 00:32:44.030\n>> Great information Don.\n\n724\n00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:48.115\nAnd if you're in a certification endeavor,\nyou definitely need to know this for\n\n725\n00:32:48.115 --> 00:32:48.663\nthe exam.\n\n726\n00:32:48.663 --> 00:32:50.490\nBut if your not in\na certification endeavor,\n\n727\n00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:52.853\nyou need to be doing this on\nyour systems to keep them safe.\n\n728\n00:32:52.853 --> 00:32:53.990\nAll great information.\n\n729\n00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.569\nDon, got anything else for us on this one?\n\n730\n00:32:55.569 --> 00:32:59.290\n>> You know James in the chat room\nmentioned he was mentioning something else\n\n731\n00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:02.361\nbut it kind of reminded me how\nhe changes his SSH port number.\n\n732\n00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:04.404\nEverybody knows SSH uses port 22.\n\n733\n00:33:04.404 --> 00:33:07.560\nYou could actually go and change your\nport number and be something different.\n\n734\n00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.059\nNow that's not the truest.\n\n735\n00:33:09.059 --> 00:33:11.533\nIt’s more like security obfuscation,\nright.\n\n736\n00:33:11.533 --> 00:33:12.798\nIt's security through obscurity.\n\n737\n00:33:12.798 --> 00:33:15.551\nYou're kind of hiding SSH by moving\nit to a different port number, but\n\n738\n00:33:15.551 --> 00:33:17.150\nit does help to increase that security.\n\n739\n00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:18.301\nSo those are all different things.\n\n740\n00:33:18.301 --> 00:33:20.576\nJust remember, there's a ton of\ndifferent options out there.\n\n741\n00:33:20.576 --> 00:33:23.350\nJust come up with something consistent and\nmake sure you follow it all the time.\n\n742\n00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.232\n>> Very good.\n\n743\n00:33:24.232 --> 00:33:26.733\nWell it looks like we've\ncome to another or\n\n744\n00:33:26.733 --> 00:33:30.559\nthe end I should say of another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n745\n00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:32.358\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this one.\n\n746\n00:33:32.358 --> 00:33:33.798\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n747\n00:33:33.798 --> 00:33:34.738\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n748\n00:33:34.738 --> 00:33:35.876\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n749\n00:33:35.876 --> 00:33:45.310\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.260\nI'm your host, Wes Bryant, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.430\nin today's episode we're going to be\nmoving along in our Cloud + episodes and\n\n5\n00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.970\nwe're going to be taking a look at,\nwell a little bit of the paperwork and\n\n6\n00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.880\nstuff you need to know from the business\nperspective and that's policies and\n\n7\n00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.200\nprocedures, and we have none other\nthan Mr. Don Pezet to help us out.\n\n8\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.310\nDon, how you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.410\n>> I'm doing great Wes,\nready to jump back into Cloud world and\n\n10\n00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.250\nlittle less Cloud world, we keep talking\nabout all these virtual technologies but\n\n11\n00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.510\ntoday we are doing exactly what you said,\ntalking about paperwork and bureaucracy.\n\n12\n00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.420\nAnd don't cringe, right?\n\n13\n00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.410\nThere is a lot of infrastructure\nwhen we deploy a cloud.\n\n14\n00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.170\nWhen it's a private cloud, especially,\nthere's a ton of infrastructure.\n\n15\n00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.970\nBut even when it's a public\ncloud out there on the internet,\n\n16\n00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.460\nthere's still infrastructure\nthat we have to manage.\n\n17\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.380\nWe might not have to deal with\nthe underlying hardware of hard\n\n18\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.000\ndrives and all that.\n\n19\n00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.640\nBut you still have bills to pay, you still\nhave virtual machines to manage, you still\n\n20\n00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.170\nhave IP address, and all that other good\nstuff that we've gotta keep track of.\n\n21\n00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.760\nAnd so what Comptea recommends is that you\napply ITIL practices in your workplace.\n\n22\n00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.960\nAnd that's what we're gonna be taking\na look at here in this episode,\n\n23\n00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.880\nare some of the different ITIL practices.\n\n24\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.280\nIf you're not familiar with ITIL,\ndon't worry about it.\n\n25\n00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.380\nThat we'll learn about\nright here in this episode.\n\n26\n00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.150\nSomething we can apply to make sure that\neverything we do is done consistently,\n\n27\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.370\nefficiently, and most importantly,\nreproducibly, right?\n\n28\n00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.490\nIt's done the same way every time.\n\n29\n00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.670\nNice and consistent.\n\n30\n00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.440\nThat we ensure that we\nare doing things the right way.\n\n31\n00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.120\nThat's really what this bureaucracy\nkind of piece is all about.\n\n32\n00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.000\n>> Now, Don when we look at things\nlike enterprise level environments,\n\n33\n00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.980\nwe can have.\n\n34\n00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.790\nYou know 500 computers,\nthousands of computers.\n\n35\n00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.350\nWe can have different software,\nwe can have servers.\n\n36\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.220\nWe looked at storage networks, right.\n\n37\n00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.470\nSo there's a lot of components that well,\n\n38\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.120\nare under the hood of a major\nenterprise environment.\n\n39\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.772\nDon, how is it that we track\nthis type of complexity.\n\n40\n00:01:59.772 --> 00:02:03.157\n>> All right, so in the olden days\nwe tracked it with paperwork.\n\n41\n00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:08.596\nYou had Excel spreadsheets or just paper\non your desk that you would track it with.\n\n42\n00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:11.182\nAnd in the olden days even today\nwhen you have a private cloud,\n\n43\n00:02:11.182 --> 00:02:14.517\nwhen you manage your own infrastructure,\nthere's kind of this nice piece that\n\n44\n00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:18.300\nforces us to keep track of things and\nthat's the accounting department.\n\n45\n00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.880\nIf I want to add a new server, I can't\njust call HP and say hey send me a server.\n\n46\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.650\nBecause what's HP gonna say?\n\n47\n00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.320\nShow me the money.\n\n48\n00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.030\nWe need some money or we're not gonna\ngive you the server, so we've gotta go to\n\n49\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.990\nthe accounting department,\nwe've gotta get them to cut a PO,\n\n50\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.810\nsend that to HP, they send us the server,\nHP sends a bill, accounting pays the bill.\n\n51\n00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.650\nWe kind of have a good handle\non how many servers we have and\n\n52\n00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.720\nhow much other hardware and\nhow much our software licensing is,\n\n53\n00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.920\nbecause the accounting department\nis staying on top of it.\n\n54\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.710\nAll right?\n\n55\n00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.780\nBut when you deploy a public cloud.\n\n56\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.570\nIf I go into Amazon AWS or\nMicrosoft Azure and\n\n57\n00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.180\nI start whipping up VMs, all that\nstuff doesn't happen anymore, right?\n\n58\n00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.720\nIt's all just done.\n\n59\n00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.876\nAnd in a matter of a couple of clicks,\nI can have new servers deployed and\n\n60\n00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:00.856\nmy bill goes up.\n\n61\n00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:04.477\nBut I don't notice right away because it's\nall just being billed to a credit card.\n\n62\n00:03:04.477 --> 00:03:06.591\nWe have a credit card on file.\n\n63\n00:03:06.591 --> 00:03:08.942\nAnd as I spit out more\nservers the credit card bill,\n\n64\n00:03:08.942 --> 00:03:10.701\nmaybe 30 days later will be higher.\n\n65\n00:03:10.701 --> 00:03:12.884\nAnd the accounting department\nwill find out eventually.\n\n66\n00:03:12.884 --> 00:03:15.870\nAnd they'll look at it and they'll say,\nwhy is the bill higher this month?\n\n67\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.460\nAnd when they look at that bill\nthey won't necessarily know.\n\n68\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.700\nIs it higher because\nwe added more servers?\n\n69\n00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.850\nIs it higher because we\nused more bandwidth?\n\n70\n00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.800\nIs it higher because\nwe're using more storage?\n\n71\n00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.630\nAll of those things are stuff that impacts\nour bill, and it makes the bill go higher.\n\n72\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.410\nSo the accounting department no\nlonger has visibility into that.\n\n73\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.600\nAnd if we're not tracking it,\nthen nobody has visibility.\n\n74\n00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.640\nAnd for all you know, somebody\ncould have hacked your account and\n\n75\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.030\nstarted spinning up\ninstances as Bitcoin miners.\n\n76\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.170\nThis is what happens, if somebody\ncompromises one of your cloud accounts,\n\n77\n00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.650\nthey'll usually spin up VMs\nto create Bitcoin miners.\n\n78\n00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.080\nThat way they can turn\nit into easily laundered\n\n79\n00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.320\nuntraceable money that's\nkinda the goal there.\n\n80\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.550\nOr they go after your database right?\n\n81\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.603\nThat's kinda the other side, but\n\n82\n00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:56.808\nthe Bitcoin mining is a little\nmore lucrative for these guys.\n\n83\n00:03:56.808 --> 00:03:58.627\nSo they'll start generating\nthat revenue and\n\n84\n00:03:58.627 --> 00:04:01.528\nyou won't notice until you're bill\ncomes in and you see it higher right?\n\n85\n00:04:01.528 --> 00:04:05.556\nSo we've got to keep a good handle on\nthe resources we have deployed and\n\n86\n00:04:05.556 --> 00:04:10.060\nnot just from a what's my bill gonna be\nkinda standpoint, but because you more\n\n87\n00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.590\nthan likely have regulatory compliance and\nother things you've got to meet.\n\n88\n00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.222\nAt a minimum you pay taxes on\na lot of this stuff and so\n\n89\n00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:20.834\nat the end of the year you might be\nable to depreciate the value of some of\n\n90\n00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:23.730\nthis equipment to defray your tax burden.\n\n91\n00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.410\nRight?\nI know\n\n92\n00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.540\nI'm starting to use accounting terms I\nneed to stop that, this is an IT show.\n\n93\n00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.280\nBut it's a real issue.\n\n94\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.080\nIt's something that your accounting\ndepartment has to deal with.\n\n95\n00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.200\nAnd so, it's really blending what the IT\npeople do, getting servers up and\n\n96\n00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.030\nrunning, and what the accountants\ndo to keep your company up and\n\n97\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.240\nrunning and financially viable.\n\n98\n00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.760\nEvery company needs to make money or\nthey're not gonna be around very long.\n\n99\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.652\nSo we gotta combine these two worlds, and\nthat's where stuff gets really tricky.\n\n100\n00:04:48.652 --> 00:04:50.567\nAnd that's where ITIL comes in.\n\n101\n00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:53.676\nSo, the British government or\nthe UK government recognized,\n\n102\n00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:57.835\nthis is many years ago, probably 15,\n20 years ago, they recognized that IT was\n\n103\n00:04:57.835 --> 00:05:01.527\nbecoming a growing thing and there\nwere a lot of companies, contractors,\n\n104\n00:05:01.527 --> 00:05:05.660\nthat were coming to deploy IT related\ntechnologies for the government.\n\n105\n00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.940\nAnd some of them went great and\nit was wonderful and\n\n106\n00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.000\nthe technology was deployed and\nit was a beautiful thing.\n\n107\n00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.980\nBut many of them would come in and\nmismanage their budget,\n\n108\n00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.150\nmismanage their schedule, mismanage\nthe documentation of their product.\n\n109\n00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.430\nAnd by the time it rolled out,\nthey'd be way over budget, or\n\n110\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.413\ntheir product wouldn't work as it was\noriginally pitched to the government.\n\n111\n00:05:24.413 --> 00:05:26.247\nAnd they were having these projects fail.\n\n112\n00:05:26.247 --> 00:05:30.646\nAnd so the British government recognized\nthat early on that this was gonna be\n\n113\n00:05:30.646 --> 00:05:34.216\na problem, and so they set out\nto create a governance system,\n\n114\n00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:37.100\na way to be able to better\nmonitor these projects,\n\n115\n00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.841\nto better monitor these IT companies to\nmake sure they were running properly, and\n\n116\n00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:46.512\nthat governance then started to evolve\ninto a framework of, hey, if you wanna do\n\n117\n00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:51.370\nbusiness with the UK government, here's\nhow you need to structure your company.\n\n118\n00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.470\nIt's like a set of instructions,\n\n119\n00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.150\na framework of how you should\nmanage your department.\n\n120\n00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.830\nAnd what started out as just a way to\nprotect the government over there from\n\n121\n00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.580\nfailed projects,\nbecame a really great thing.\n\n122\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.580\nAnd now across the world,\neven here in the US,\n\n123\n00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.360\ncompanies are willingly adopting\nITIL to structure their environment.\n\n124\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.400\nAnd it's because they know this can help\nto guarantee the success of our projects,\n\n125\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.070\nto make our company more stable,\nmore dependable.\n\n126\n00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.595\nAnd when we start to advertise as\na product to a customer, the customer can\n\n127\n00:06:22.595 --> 00:06:26.145\ncount on us doing a better job, cuz they\nknow we're following these practices.\n\n128\n00:06:26.145 --> 00:06:27.415\nAnd that's what ITIL does.\n\n129\n00:06:27.415 --> 00:06:32.345\nAnd if you want to learn a bunch about\nITIL, we actually had a whole show\n\n130\n00:06:32.345 --> 00:06:34.905\ncalled ITIL foundations, where,\nI think it was Ronnie and I.\n\n131\n00:06:34.905 --> 00:06:38.868\nWe went through and covered all\nthe different topics and what ITIL is and\n\n132\n00:06:38.868 --> 00:06:40.395\nall the different pieces.\n\n133\n00:06:40.395 --> 00:06:41.857\nCompTIA doesn't want you to know all that.\n\n134\n00:06:41.857 --> 00:06:46.440\nCompTIA wants you to know the stuff\nthat impacts a regular worker.\n\n135\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.340\nSo if you're an IT administrator,\n\n136\n00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.320\nif you're the person running this cloud,\nwhat do you need to know.\n\n137\n00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.760\nAnd there's a couple of pieces.\n\n138\n00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.210\nYou don't need to know how to\ncut a check to pay for a bill.\n\n139\n00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.090\nBecause the accounting department's\ngonna take care of that.\n\n140\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.620\nBut there's operations that\nyou are responsible for and so\n\n141\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.690\nI wanna run through those.\n\n142\n00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.510\n>> So in the CompTIA world, we always talk\nabout that kinda setting the stage and\n\n143\n00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.180\nyou learn a lot of introductory terms.\n\n144\n00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.930\nWe hit you with a bunch of acronyms.\n\n145\n00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.460\nRight?\n\n146\n00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.550\nWe commonly talk about things like\nstandardization and some of you guys have\n\n147\n00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.860\nprobably seen, we've talked about\nstandardization of cables, protocols.\n\n148\n00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.550\nAnd what does that do?\n\n149\n00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.060\nit gives you a consistency and\n\n150\n00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.900\nan interoperability between many different\nmoving components inside of networking.\n\n151\n00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.670\nWell Don is the ITILl pretty much the same\nthing, but for a lot of the stuff then can\n\n152\n00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.710\nget lost in the wash proverbially,\nlike in paperwork and stuff like that?\n\n153\n00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:37.210\n>> Absolutely, yeah it's a bureaucracy,\ndon't get me wrong, it is extra work that\n\n154\n00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.230\nyou're gonna have to do, but it's going to\nensure that all the moving pieces in your\n\n155\n00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.430\ndepartment are properly being tracked,\nand so let's kind of break that down.\n\n156\n00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.557\nFirst off, I've said ITIL a few times,\nI don't think I've said what it stood for.\n\n157\n00:07:47.557 --> 00:07:51.708\nIt's the information technology,\nIT, industry, not industry,\n\n158\n00:07:51.708 --> 00:07:53.861\ninfrastructure library, right?\n\n159\n00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:55.668\nAnd what it is is a library,\n\n160\n00:07:55.668 --> 00:08:00.631\na collection of recommended processes\nthat you can take or leave, right?\n\n161\n00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:02.630\nIf you take them, you use them.\n\n162\n00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.410\nYou integrate them into your system and\nit explains how to do stuff.\n\n163\n00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.390\nAnd so some of the things in there center\naround really important concepts like\n\n164\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.040\nchange management.\n\n165\n00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.010\nWe'll talk about that later.\n\n166\n00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.230\nReally critical key.\n\n167\n00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.210\nIf you use nothing else from ITIL,\n\n168\n00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.440\nchange management is definitely\na piece you'll want to use.\n\n169\n00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.350\nBut asset management is another big piece.\n\n170\n00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.100\nWhen we're deploying physical servers\nin our environment, we've already got\n\n171\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.340\nasset management cuz the accounting\ndepartment acts as a gatekeeper.\n\n172\n00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.455\nBut in the virtual world,\n\n173\n00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:30.300\nyou've gotta track you assets, your\nassets are not physical assets anymore.\n\n174\n00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.080\nSo I might have one virtual server or\n20 virtual servers.\n\n175\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.960\nBut when I walk up to my\noffice in the morning,\n\n176\n00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.360\nit doesn't look any different, right?\n\n177\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.160\nBecause these servers are virtual,\nthey're out there on the cloud,\n\n178\n00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.170\nI don't actually see it.\n\n179\n00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:43.050\nBut I'm paying that bill and\nI've gotta keep track of that.\n\n180\n00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.080\nAnd every server has characteristics.\n\n181\n00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.550\nIt has a name, it has an IP address,\nit has an amount of RAM,\n\n182\n00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.690\nit has certain applications running on it.\n\n183\n00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.950\nI need to keep track of that,\ntoo, so I can say, hm,\n\n184\n00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:59.600\nI just noticed there's an exploit out for\nWindows 2012, all right?\n\n185\n00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.176\nHow many servers do I have\nthat are running Windows 2012?\n\n186\n00:09:01.176 --> 00:09:03.208\nI don't know, right?\n\n187\n00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:07.180\nHow do I know I've patched them all,\nif I don't know how many I have?\n\n188\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.240\nOr it's a Linux exploit.\n\n189\n00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.400\nHow many do I have that are running Linux?\n\n190\n00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.970\nOr a particular version,\na particular distro?\n\n191\n00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.640\nWe need to have inventories\nthat tell us that.\n\n192\n00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.190\nSo that we can go in and\nrapidly find out, how vulnerable am I?\n\n193\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.920\nThere's been several OpenSSL\nexploits recently, and\n\n194\n00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.100\nthey always hit the news\nbecause it is a big deal.\n\n195\n00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.420\nSo if I know that a particular\nversion of OpenSSL has an exploit,\n\n196\n00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.780\ndo I have a way to quickly\nlook at all of my servers and\n\n197\n00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.250\nfind out how many of them\nare running that version of OpenSSL?\n\n198\n00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.960\nWell you'd be surprised at how many\ncompanies don't have a way to do that,\n\n199\n00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.860\nand there's plenty of ways\nthat they could do it, right?\n\n200\n00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.870\nGood asset management is really important.\n\n201\n00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.300\nPhysical assets we need to track for\ntax purposes, right?\n\n202\n00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.090\nBut also for warranty purposes.\n\n203\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.350\nWhen a warranty runs out,\nyou need to re-up the warranty so\n\n204\n00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.900\nthat's covered if you have a failure.\n\n205\n00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.340\nWe need to track serial numbers that\nwe know something goes missing, right?\n\n206\n00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.050\nIf I have a branch office and there's 20\nworkstations there, and I go around one\n\n207\n00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.580\nday and there's only 18 workstations,\nwhat happened to the other two?\n\n208\n00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.340\nThey got stolen, they're gone, right?\n\n209\n00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.920\nAnd we need to take those serial numbers\nand turn them into the authorities.\n\n210\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.450\nAnd that way the police can go and check\nthe pawn shops and stuff in your area.\n\n211\n00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.918\nAnd they'll usually turn up right there,\nor they'll be sold on eBay, but\n\n212\n00:10:10.918 --> 00:10:12.990\nwe need to have that serial number.\n\n213\n00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.100\nIf the unit's already been stolen,\n\n214\n00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.880\nand I don't have the serial number\ndocumented anywhere I'm out of luck.\n\n215\n00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.820\nHow can I report that machine and\neven hope for it to be found?\n\n216\n00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:20.830\nIt's not gonna happen.\n\n217\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.670\n>> It sounds like this would also run hand\nin hand with something like a business\n\n218\n00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.410\ncontinuity plan, asset management.\n\n219\n00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.340\nYou've got to figure out what are my most\ncritical systems that I have to get back\n\n220\n00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.270\nonline in case of DRP,\ndisaster recovery planning?\n\n221\n00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.980\nSo it looks like this asset management\ncan help you all across the board in many\n\n222\n00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.100\ndifferent scenarios, specifically\nthinking of a continuity plan.\n\n223\n00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.832\n>> Yeah, and that kinda falls in\nline with asset accountability.\n\n224\n00:10:42.832 --> 00:10:43.354\n>> Okay, yeah.\n\n225\n00:10:43.354 --> 00:10:46.910\n>> So when you track an asset\nyou need to know what it is.\n\n226\n00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.950\nWhat kind of server it is, what kind\nof router, what kind of firewall.\n\n227\n00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.560\nWhat's it's serial\nnumber if it's physical?\n\n228\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.460\nIf it's virtual obviously you\ndon't have a serial number.\n\n229\n00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.910\nYou need to know characteristics,\nhow much memory is assigned to it,\n\n230\n00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.610\nhow much storage is assigned to it?\n\n231\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.630\nAnd that way if I ever have to rebuild it,\nright,\n\n232\n00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.800\nwhat am I gonna need to rebuild it,\nalso whether it's critical.\n\n233\n00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.260\nWes mentioned the classification.\n\n234\n00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.437\nIf I have a true disaster today,\nwhat gets restored first?\n\n235\n00:11:07.437 --> 00:11:11.512\nWhat gets restored second,\nwhat gets restored third?\n\n236\n00:11:11.512 --> 00:11:15.026\nWhat's a critical service, a non-critical\nservice, and an optional service, right,\n\n237\n00:11:15.026 --> 00:11:15.993\nthese different tiers.\n\n238\n00:11:15.993 --> 00:11:17.351\nAnd you can name them whatever you want,\nright?\n\n239\n00:11:17.351 --> 00:11:19.009\nYou create the tiers\nthat are appropriate for\n\n240\n00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:20.717\nyour company, and\nkind of catalog those out.\n\n241\n00:11:20.717 --> 00:11:27.018\nAnd that's all a critical process,\na key piece of asset management.\n\n242\n00:11:27.018 --> 00:11:31.260\nAnd it's a little bit hard to\ntrack on paper like we used to.\n\n243\n00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.292\nIt used to be that you could have\na little book and you could track it.\n\n244\n00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:35.354\nBut these days we need\nthis stuff to be dynamic,\n\n245\n00:11:35.354 --> 00:11:38.900\nespecially if you're dynamically\nprovisioning servers in the cloud, right?\n\n246\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.240\nSo we're gonna need\nthird-party software and\n\n247\n00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.780\nthere's plenty of companies out\nthere that make asset management.\n\n248\n00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.850\nI've got an example here to pull up on my\nlaptop which is SolarWinds, a software and\n\n249\n00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.140\nhardware asset inventory management,\nright?\n\n250\n00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.820\nIt's an application that you can run,\nit's web-based, right?\n\n251\n00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.160\nSo you can run it on a web server, and\n\n252\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160\nthen anybody in your\ncompany can log into it.\n\n253\n00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.880\nAnd it will track your physical assets.\n\n254\n00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.440\nSo see here how like it's got\na physical server pulled up?\n\n255\n00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.090\nHere's the IP address of the server,\nwhether the IP is dynamic or\n\n256\n00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:06.990\nstatic, right?\n\n257\n00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.019\nThis one says no for dynamic, so\nthis has a static IP assigned to it.\n\n258\n00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:14.930\nWe can see the model of the server and\nits service tag and its warranty status.\n\n259\n00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.140\nThis one's out of warranty,\nI need to re-up the warranty.\n\n260\n00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.600\nThis is HP, so I can call HP and I can\ngive them this service tag and I can say,\n\n261\n00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.280\nhey, I've got this server that's out\nof warranty, can I re-up that warranty?\n\n262\n00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.650\nIt's all right here.\n\n263\n00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.954\nOr if there's a problem,\nwhen I call HP, I'm like hey,\n\n264\n00:12:28.954 --> 00:12:32.266\nI've got a failed hard drive in the server\nand they say, what's the service tag?\n\n265\n00:12:32.266 --> 00:12:35.002\nAnd I say, let me put you down while\nI run into the server room and\n\n266\n00:12:35.002 --> 00:12:36.410\ngo look at the back of that server.\n\n267\n00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.260\nNow I don't have to do that,\nit's right here.\n\n268\n00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.880\nI can see it, right?\n\n269\n00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.970\nAnd I can see the operating system\nthat it's running and the version.\n\n270\n00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:48.737\nYou can normally pull up what system\nupdates it's had and other things.\n\n271\n00:12:48.737 --> 00:12:53.210\nWe can see the hard drives on it, all\nthis information about the system, okay?\n\n272\n00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:57.370\nNow, when you choose software\nlike this to do asset management,\n\n273\n00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.250\nthere's two different levels of it, right?\n\n274\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.260\nThere's usually cheap and\nfree stuff that is static.\n\n275\n00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.510\nAnd then there's expensive\nstuff that's dynamic.\n\n276\n00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.610\nThe static stuff is really\nlike a spreadsheet.\n\n277\n00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.020\nWhen you buy a new server,\nyou've gotta put in all the data yourself.\n\n278\n00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.970\nAnd when you apply Windows updates,\n\n279\n00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.200\nyou've gotta update all the versions\nin the spreadsheet yourself.\n\n280\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.410\nAnd that becomes a real burden and\nso people don't do it.\n\n281\n00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.030\nYou might track the hardware and\nthe serial number but\n\n282\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.730\nthey're not gonna track the version\nnumber of each DLL on the system.\n\n283\n00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.520\nSo now if I want to know which servers are\nrunning OpenSSL with a certain version,\n\n284\n00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.260\nI can't find that.\n\n285\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.330\nCuz it was too hard to\ngather that information.\n\n286\n00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.620\nBut the dynamic software, the software\nthat's expensive, it goes out and\n\n287\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.480\nit harvests that data for you.\n\n288\n00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.690\nOnce an hour, once every 24 hours, however\noften, it goes out and does inventory.\n\n289\n00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:39.680\nAnd it gather it so\n\n290\n00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.670\nif somebody changes a harddrive out\nin a server, it'll know about it.\n\n291\n00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.090\nIf a software update gets applied,\nit'll know about it.\n\n292\n00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.980\nAnd that's really important,\n\n293\n00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.340\nespecially when we talk about\nchange management later on.\n\n294\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.330\nIf somebody makes an unauthorized change,\n\n295\n00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.950\nlike swapping out a hard drive,\nwe'll know about it.\n\n296\n00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.652\nBecause we've got that inventory and\nwe've been tracking it, right?\n\n297\n00:13:57.652 --> 00:14:00.325\nSo that's a key thing, asset inventory.\n\n298\n00:14:00.325 --> 00:14:04.295\nEven simple concepts like IP addresses\nbecome really, really challenging, right?\n\n299\n00:14:04.295 --> 00:14:06.325\nLet me show you an example with AWS,\nright?\n\n300\n00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:10.675\nSo if I go into AWS, here's Amazon Web\nServices, and I've got an instance that I\n\n301\n00:14:10.675 --> 00:14:14.135\nfired up here, itprotv-web01,\nit's just a web server, right?\n\n302\n00:14:14.135 --> 00:14:19.650\nWhen you spin up an instance in Amazon's\nWeb Services, it gets a dynamic IP,\n\n303\n00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.400\nwhich doesn't show up here apparently.\n\n304\n00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.160\nIt must be down here, and there it is.\n\n305\n00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.380\nIt gets a dynamic IP.\n\n306\n00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.818\nMine got 54.152.69.11, right?\n\n307\n00:14:28.818 --> 00:14:31.250\nThat's the IP that was assigned to it.\n\n308\n00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:35.140\nBut if I shut this system down,\nright, so if I take the instance and\n\n309\n00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.810\nI stop it, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nstop this, and its gonna shut down.\n\n310\n00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.110\nAll right, when it shuts down,\nthat wasn't dynamic IP.\n\n311\n00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.504\nIt was just a big pool of\navailable to any customer,\n\n312\n00:14:43.504 --> 00:14:46.863\nI just happened to be the person that\ncame along and grabbed it, right?\n\n313\n00:14:46.863 --> 00:14:50.961\nAnd so that one was 154,\nI should write this down,\n\n314\n00:14:50.961 --> 00:14:56.190\n154.152.69.11 was the IP that it had,\nright?\n\n315\n00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.650\nSo as soon as it stops,\nI can start it again.\n\n316\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.680\nBut since the IP was dynamic,\nthe IP address may change.\n\n317\n00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.139\nIt's a dynamic, the IP changes.\n\n318\n00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:06.610\nI need to keep track of that.\n\n319\n00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:11.500\nBut, if I want that system to have\nalways have the same IP no matter what,\n\n320\n00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.230\nI need to do a static IP assignment.\n\n321\n00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.150\nAnd if I start doing\nstatic IP assignments,\n\n322\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:20.140\nthere's a chance that I could use\nthe same IP in more than one place.\n\n323\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.390\nNow I get a duplicate IP and\nthe server doesn't work.\n\n324\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.250\nSo I need a way to track\nthe static IPs that I assign.\n\n325\n00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.290\nAnd to be able to monitor and\nmake sure they're actually in use.\n\n326\n00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.310\nAnd if they change, that we see that that\nsystem's no longer showing as online so\n\n327\n00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:32.260\nwe can recognize it.\n\n328\n00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.790\nThis is really important with private IPs.\n\n329\n00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:37.630\nIf you're doing your own private cloud and\nyou're bringing up VM's left and right and\n\n330\n00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:41.100\nyou're giving them static IPs,\nyou've gotta have a way to track that.\n\n331\n00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.240\nIf you're using DHCP it's nice,\nyou won't get duplicate IPs.\n\n332\n00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.008\nBut every time your server reboots\nyou're at risk of the IP changing.\n\n333\n00:15:47.008 --> 00:15:50.216\nIf you build your software service\naround host names and not IPs,\n\n334\n00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:53.554\nthen you're actually okay with\nthe IP changing, what do you care?\n\n335\n00:15:53.554 --> 00:15:56.835\nBut if it's something like a network\nprinter You want the network printer to\n\n336\n00:15:56.835 --> 00:15:59.922\nalways have the same IP address,\nand so you've gotta assign statics.\n\n337\n00:15:59.922 --> 00:16:02.180\nAnd the statics become that problem,\nright?\n\n338\n00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.240\nSo now if I come in here and\nstart this instance back up, so\n\n339\n00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.610\nit shut down I'm gonna start it back up.\n\n340\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.230\nIt will more than likely\nget a different IP.\n\n341\n00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.680\nIt could potentially get the same IP but\n\n342\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.220\nthere are tons of customers spinning\nup servers in Amazon all the time.\n\n343\n00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.350\nAnd so the odds are my IP has already\nbeen provisioned out to somebody else.\n\n344\n00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.630\nAnd so when I come up,\nI'll get a different IP.\n\n345\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.980\nSo we'll give that a second\nwhile it spins up.\n\n346\n00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.395\nIf I wanna static IP,\nI've gotten go over here to elastic IP's.\n\n347\n00:16:30.395 --> 00:16:34.530\nElastic IP's are static IP's that we\ncreate inside of AWS and we can assign\n\n348\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:39.530\nthose to machines But we assign them, and\nI can move it from one machine to another.\n\n349\n00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.430\nSo how do I track who that's assigned to?\n\n350\n00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.538\nI need some kind of\nsoftware to do that and\n\n351\n00:16:43.538 --> 00:16:46.143\nthat's called IP Address Management,\nor IPAM.\n\n352\n00:16:46.143 --> 00:16:49.007\nThere's a lot of companies out there that\nmake IPAM tracking software there's a lot\n\n353\n00:16:49.007 --> 00:16:51.420\nof companies out there that\nmake IPAM tracking software.\n\n354\n00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.600\nIn the show, anytime in this episode rush,\nthere's a lot of companies that do this,\n\n355\n00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.210\nI'll put at least two or three examples\nof each one in this show notes for\n\n356\n00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.660\nyou just so you can and\nsee some real products.\n\n357\n00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.897\nBut one example of software\nthat tracks these IP's.\n\n358\n00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:04.953\nLet's see, have I gotten a new IP yet?\n\n359\n00:17:04.953 --> 00:17:05.916\nI'm getting impatient.\n\n360\n00:17:05.916 --> 00:17:06.995\nThere we go.\n\n361\n00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:12.414\nSo my instance came up and\nI got a new IP, it's 54.152.188.140,\n\n362\n00:17:12.414 --> 00:17:17.670\nearlier I was 54.152.188.69.11,\nmy IP changed.\n\n363\n00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.790\nAnd that was just me stopping and\nstarting the instance.\n\n364\n00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.000\nNow we've got a new IP.\n\n365\n00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.430\nThere's where my challenge\nstarts to kick in.\n\n366\n00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.930\nWhat IP do I have this day?\n\n367\n00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:25.830\nI don't know.\n\n368\n00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:30.880\nI can go down here to the elastic IP's,\nI can allocate a new address, and\n\n369\n00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.600\nnow I'm gonna get this\naddress 52.73.55.99.\n\n370\n00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.950\nThat's now attached to my account It's\nattached to me and I'll always have it.\n\n371\n00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.840\n>> Now, some of you might be thinking,\nwell, that's done.\n\n372\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.480\nHow hard is that to keep track of?\n\n373\n00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.840\nYou've got a server there.\n\n374\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.580\nYou mentioned a network printer earlier.\n\n375\n00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.000\nWell, how hard is a network printer\nkeep track of its IP address?\n\n376\n00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.530\nWell, what if you have 400, 500 servers?\n\n377\n00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.280\nOr if you have 100s of printers,\n\n378\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.510\nand they're dispersed\ngeographically all over the place?\n\n379\n00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.750\nWe're not just talking about one, we're\ntalking about multitudes and many of them,\n\n380\n00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.440\nand you can see where something like this\nwould become an administrative complexity,\n\n381\n00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.620\nif not an administrative nightmare, if you\ndidn't have one of these technologies.\n\n382\n00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.500\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n383\n00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.310\nAnd so you can see here where I just\nassigned that Elastic IP to this instance,\n\n384\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.890\nand so now it's got a Static IP\nthat I can count on.\n\n385\n00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.030\nBut I need to keep track of that,\nI need to keep a record.\n\n386\n00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:25.320\nSo there's a number of products out there,\nthis is a free one called Rack Tables.\n\n387\n00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.620\nIt not the most advanced software\nin the world, but it's free,\n\n388\n00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.740\nso the price is certainly right\nif you're small or medium.\n\n389\n00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:35.600\nIf you're a larger organization, Microsoft\nWindows has IPAM built into it now,\n\n390\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.420\nWindows Server 2012.\n\n391\n00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.640\nI'll tell you, it's like the hardest\nthing on the planet to get working.\n\n392\n00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.750\nI hate the product, really Microsoft\ntook what's a simple idea and\n\n393\n00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.530\nmade it as hard as possible.\n\n394\n00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.330\nBut it is built in to Windows Server 2012.\n\n395\n00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.740\nIf you wanna try it.\n\n396\n00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.350\nSolarWinds has an IP\naddress management suite.\n\n397\n00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.410\nWho else?\nWhatsUp Gold has an IPAM.\n\n398\n00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.640\nI know they're pretty popular.\n\n399\n00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.490\nManageEngine OpUtils has\nIPAM as well as a number of\n\n400\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.140\nother things that are built into it.\n\n401\n00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.910\nAnd I think I already said solar winds,\nthey have IPAM but RackTables is free, so\n\n402\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.760\nyou can download their software and load\nit and the way that it works is it will\n\n403\n00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.340\nscan your environment and\nidentify servers.\n\n404\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.880\nAnd so it's kind of dynamic\nin the way that it works,\n\n405\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.860\nin that it will scan your system And\nbuild an IPv4 or IPv6 address space.\n\n406\n00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.850\nAnd it'll track the objects that you\nhave and allow you to build reports and\n\n407\n00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.530\nall of that as well logs and\nother things to keep track of.\n\n408\n00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.940\nAnd so if I go into the IPv4\nspace here in their demo,\n\n409\n00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.320\nI can start to see the subnets\nthat they're tracking.\n\n410\n00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.010\nSo there's many different subnets in\ntheir company that they're tracking.\n\n411\n00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.600\nHere's the Tokyo Server Farm.\n\n412\n00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.970\nLet's go take a look at that one.\n\n413\n00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.480\nIf I go look at the the Tokyo server farm,\n\n414\n00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.030\nI can get a list of IP addresses\nover here, it's 10.200.3.64.\n\n415\n00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:50.970\nIt must be like a slash, it's a slash 26.\n\n416\n00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:55.650\nIt starts at 64, and\nit goes all the way through to 127, and\n\n417\n00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.860\nwe can see the IPs they've assigned.\n\n418\n00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:02.470\nThey've assigned 10.200.3.126, and\nthey've assigned that to the Tokyo router.\n\n419\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.120\nAnd so now they've got a record\n\n420\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.560\nof it like hey I know that IP is\nbeing used by the Tokyo router.\n\n421\n00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.330\nAnd here some other ones that\nare Tokyo server 1 ,2 and 3.\n\n422\n00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:15.200\nIf I'm about to bring up Tokyo server\nnumber 4, and I wanna assign an IP,\n\n423\n00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.910\nI can look in here like these guys are all\navailable and I can pick one of those.\n\n424\n00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.700\nAnd now I don't have a duplicate ID And\n\n425\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.720\nI can keep track of who it\nis that has that system.\n\n426\n00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.020\nThis is a little more advanced\nthan just a spreadsheet.\n\n427\n00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.610\nI can do the same thing in Excel.\n\n428\n00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:28.970\nLord only knows I've done it,\nWes, you know.\n\n429\n00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.910\nWe've got an IP address sheet for\nthe studio here.\n\n430\n00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.920\n>> Yeah.\n>> But this will dynamically track it.\n\n431\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.800\nIt'll see if an IP is in use and so\nevery couple of hours it can ping across\n\n432\n00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.630\nthe network, and assuming we're allowing\nthe pings through our firewalls.\n\n433\n00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.720\nThen it'll hit those systems and\nit'll detect that they're in use.\n\n434\n00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.800\nSo even if I forget to put somebody in.\n\n435\n00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.460\nIt'll show an unknown host or\nit'll do a reverse DNS lookup to\n\n436\n00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.930\nput something in here to\nshow the IP is in use.\n\n437\n00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.450\nSo pretty cool that it can do that and\ndefinitely a good way to manage that.\n\n438\n00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.200\nAnd when I go under my objects here's\nwhere I can start to see all the different\n\n439\n00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.470\nsystems that I've got and see how\nlike longer server 4 here is in red.\n\n440\n00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.350\nIt's in my database.\n\n441\n00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:07.350\nWe had it assigned to an IP,\nbut it's either turned off or\n\n442\n00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.580\nit's IP has changed, and so now it's read.\n\n443\n00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.320\nAnd so now this one's offline.\n\n444\n00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.040\nIt's tracking that.\n\n445\n00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.810\nWe get a dynamic update.\n\n446\n00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.830\nThe dynamic stuff is really where\nyou wanna be when it comes to IPAM.\n\n447\n00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.470\nAnd so we can jump in and pull that server\nup, and we see it's got some problems.\n\n448\n00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.000\nProbably the fact that it's a Sun Fire\nserver, so it's really old.\n\n449\n00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.880\nBut [LAUGH] that's one problem but\nif I look down here I can see where\n\n450\n00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.230\nit's part of a network, but apparently\nit's not answering on that IP address.\n\n451\n00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.540\nSo either the IP is changed,\nor there's a firewall.\n\n452\n00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.600\nIt looks like the IP has changed.\n\n453\n00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.860\nIt used to be .60 and now it's .68.\n\n454\n00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.280\nSo, it's not the same, right?\n\n455\n00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.860\nNow I get that change manager.\n\n456\n00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.990\n>> Now, you mentioned also that term,\n\n457\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:48.330\nmore in context you were talking\nabout AWS and the elastic IP.\n\n458\n00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:53.620\nSo, that term elasticity,\nwe can scale out if we need servers.\n\n459\n00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.830\nIf we need 50 servers on demand,\nwe can put them into place.\n\n460\n00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.400\nNow Don if you've got a team that\nis responsible for let's say\n\n461\n00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.350\nthrowing 50 servers there when you need\nit, is there a way or a process to make\n\n462\n00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.690\nsure that you have that availability and\nthat your company can handle it?\n\n463\n00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:13.020\n>> Absolutely, so asset management is all\nabout just tracking what we have, right?\n\n464\n00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.520\nBut then, we have another concept\nwhich is capacity management.\n\n465\n00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.898\nAnd capacity management is basically\nsaying, here's what we have,\n\n466\n00:22:19.898 --> 00:22:20.650\nwhat can it do?\n\n467\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.820\nWhat are the capabilities?\n\n468\n00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:28.070\nIf I buy a server with eight processor\n\n469\n00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:32.900\ncores in it and 64 gigs of RAM and\nmaybe a terabyte of hard drive space or\n\n470\n00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.740\nwhatever, how many virtual machines\ncan I bring up on that system?\n\n471\n00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.410\nIt depends.\n\n472\n00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.470\nIt depends on what you need.\n\n473\n00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.310\nI might have already provisioned\nfive machine son there.\n\n474\n00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.330\nWell is it full?\n\n475\n00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.180\nDoes it have any available resources left?\n\n476\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.750\nIf somebody from one of the other\ndepartments comes in and says hey we need\n\n477\n00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:52.260\nanother web server and we need it now, do\nI have room on the hardware that I've got?\n\n478\n00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.470\nI don't know.\n\n479\n00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:54.930\nAsset management isn't enough.\n\n480\n00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.110\nAsset management will tell me\nthe physical resources I have,\n\n481\n00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:00.080\nit won't tell me how much of them are\nused, how much capacity I still have left.\n\n482\n00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.220\nIt won't help you plan for\nupgrades in the future.\n\n483\n00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.800\nSo normally asset management is\ncombined with capacity management.\n\n484\n00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.450\nAnd again, there's plenty of third-party\nsoftware out there that will help you\n\n485\n00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.770\nmanage capacity If your in a Microsoft\nenvironment, your systems center operation\n\n486\n00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.640\nmanager can do it, especially if you have\na system center virtual machine manager.\n\n487\n00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.900\nThey do a great job.\n\n488\n00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.030\nIn a VM ware environment,\nyou've got the V center.\n\n489\n00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:24.280\nV center ill monitor all of your hosts and\nshow you how much capacity,\n\n490\n00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.850\nhow much room you have left,\nyou can see it right there.\n\n491\n00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:29.850\nbut when you start mixing your\nenvironments where I've got\n\n492\n00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:34.090\nphysical servers, virtual hosts,\nI've got Zen server,\n\n493\n00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.400\nand KVM, and Hyper-V or whatever\nthose products start to break down.\n\n494\n00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.830\nAnd so there's plenty of third party stuff\nthat's sort of vendor agnostic that'll let\n\n495\n00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.820\nyou manage the whole things and you can\nsee your capacities across the board.\n\n496\n00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.583\nSome of them are better than others like\nMicrosoft System Center Virtual Machine\n\n497\n00:23:47.583 --> 00:23:51.028\nManager We'll manage Hyper V,\nas well as VMware, as well as Zen Server.\n\n498\n00:23:51.028 --> 00:23:53.323\nZen Server,\njust in case you have to go through this,\n\n499\n00:23:53.323 --> 00:23:56.844\nis not in the default install, you have to\ndownload it as an add on from Microsoft,\n\n500\n00:23:56.844 --> 00:23:58.341\nand then it'll support that too.\n\n501\n00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:02.067\nSo it's got that capability whatever\nproduct you pick though you just need to\n\n502\n00:24:02.067 --> 00:24:05.490\nbe able to see what extra\nresources you have in your system.\n\n503\n00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.790\nAnd solarwinds actually has\na really good product for this.\n\n504\n00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.750\nI'm in the solarwinds network\nperformance monitor here and\n\n505\n00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.470\nthey've got there virtualization monitor.\n\n506\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.420\nAnd If I go into there I can start\nto see my virtualization assets\n\n507\n00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.920\nlike a couple of VMware servers here and\na Hyper-V server down here and\n\n508\n00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.410\nI'll just take one of these\nVMware server I'll take this guy.\n\n509\n00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.290\nAnd if I float over it.\n\n510\n00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:27.490\nWell, I guess I've gone beyond that now.\n\n511\n00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.150\nBut if you float over it,\nyou'll see your available resources.\n\n512\n00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.400\nAnd when I look at this one I can\nsee that when I look at its CPU and\n\n513\n00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.716\nmemory load, this guy is floating at 0.\n\n514\n00:24:37.716 --> 00:24:39.680\n0% CPU and 0% memory.\n\n515\n00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.810\nSo either I can't contact the server,\nor it's completely empty.\n\n516\n00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.640\nIt's not doing anything.\n\n517\n00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.710\nAnd so if I continue to look.\n\n518\n00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.020\nI can kind of pull up my node details,\nmy management, and we can get and\n\n519\n00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.920\nidea if there's any virtual\nmachines running on this system.\n\n520\n00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.330\nAnd as I look at it, I'm really just\nnot seeing anything reporting here,\n\n521\n00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.240\nthis looks like an empty system.\n\n522\n00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.430\nAnd since it's empty that means I've\ngot available resources to be able to\n\n523\n00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:05.600\nprovision out.\n\n524\n00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.120\nI've got RAM, CPU, I've got those\nresources here that are available for\n\n525\n00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.380\nme to issue out, right?\n\n526\n00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.310\nAnd I can jump into storage and so on.\n\n527\n00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:18.480\nIf I go back to my home screen for\nthe virtualization side, when I go back\n\n528\n00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.710\nI can look at one of the other servers,\nand it may not have as many resources.\n\n529\n00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.630\nAnd so when somebody from accounting calls\ndown and says, hey, we need a new server\n\n530\n00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.670\nspun up for whatever product they're\nrunning that day, I can just come in here\n\n531\n00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:33.990\nand look, and kinda float over each one\nof these and see, hey this one is empty.\n\n532\n00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.570\nIt's got no resources in use right now.\n\n533\n00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.270\nBut when I look at these other ones,\nactually are all these empty?\n\n534\n00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.120\nHere's one, this guy right here.\n\n535\n00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.951\nMemory used, 95%, right.\n\n536\n00:25:43.951 --> 00:25:48.430\nCPU, 15%, it's got plenty extra CPU,\nbut memory, it's out.\n\n537\n00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.300\nWe've allocated all the RAM on\nthis system that we can allocate,\n\n538\n00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.590\nI can't fit anymore\nvirtual machines on it.\n\n539\n00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.200\nAnd if I look at some of these other ones,\nI may have that room.\n\n540\n00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.855\nThis one, memory used 0%.\n\n541\n00:25:57.855 --> 00:25:58.462\nRight.\n\n542\n00:25:58.462 --> 00:25:59.650\nApp Health is not healthy.\n\n543\n00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.700\nWe have to look at what that's talking\nabout but the server itself has room.\n\n544\n00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.130\nThis is capacity management.\n\n545\n00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.500\nHow much can we handle?\n\n546\n00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.330\nAnd you can track this over time.\n\n547\n00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.960\nThis vCenter right here is showing as 95%\nmemory used well is that just a spike?\n\n548\n00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.980\nIs that just happening right now?\n\n549\n00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.530\nMaybe later it'll have\nplenty of room on it.\n\n550\n00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:18.060\nRight?\n\n551\n00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.980\nSo we can use this to build trends.\n\n552\n00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.980\nWe can watch it over time.\n\n553\n00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.040\nIn fact, if I click on that server\nlet's go look at it over time.\n\n554\n00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:31.590\nSo if I jump in here and pull up that\nCPU utilization Where the CPU load or\n\n555\n00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:34.090\nmemory, sorry, I was talking about memory,\nthat was at 95%.\n\n556\n00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.520\nHow long has it been at 95%?\n\n557\n00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.020\nWell, I can drill into here and find out.\n\n558\n00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.190\nAnd remember, it's pulling the server,\nit's been like that for at least a day.\n\n559\n00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.470\nAnd let's change this chart to be for\nthe last month, right?\n\n560\n00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:48.060\nSo I can say for, not just this month,\nI want the last 30 days.\n\n561\n00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.320\nThere we go.\n\n562\n00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.340\nSometimes you do, like, this month and\nit only gives you two weeks of data and,\n\n563\n00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.950\nthere we go, so\n\n564\n00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:59.060\nI can see as of Saturday, apparently\nthis survey hasn't been up very long.\n\n565\n00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.900\nBut, so as of Saturday this things\nbeen in 95% CPU the whole time.\n\n566\n00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.940\nSo the trend here is that we're pretty\nmuch always at 95% I keep saying CPU,\n\n567\n00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.530\nthis is memory, 95% memory utilization.\n\n568\n00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.810\nIt's just tapped out, that's how it is.\n\n569\n00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.290\nBut what you might see is a steady\nincline, a steady growth,\n\n570\n00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:21.380\nand that's showing that we're using\nmore and more and more memory over time.\n\n571\n00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.790\nAnd if you see that kind of a trend you\ncan move it into the future, too, and\n\n572\n00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:29.740\nsay hey, if I've been growing by\ntwo gigs of utilization every week,\n\n573\n00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.570\nthen in eight weeks,\nI'm gonna run out of RAM.\n\n574\n00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.750\nAnd so I need to do an upgrade now, or\nI need to move some VMs from this host\n\n575\n00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:39.590\nto another host to balance things out,\nand we can start taking that action.\n\n576\n00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.940\nAnd by doing capacity management,\nwe can do this ahead of time.\n\n577\n00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.960\nWe can be proactive instead of reactive.\n\n578\n00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.940\nWe can stop the problem before it occurs.\n\n579\n00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:48.930\nAnd that's really important,\n\n580\n00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.640\ncuz if you run out of resources\nyou might have to buy hardware.\n\n581\n00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.770\nAnd if you have to buy hardware\nis that instantaneous?\n\n582\n00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.440\nNot if you manage the servers,\n\n583\n00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.280\nif you have a private cloud\nyou gotta order the hardware,\n\n584\n00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.740\nit'll be at least a day before you\ncan get the equipment, usually more.\n\n585\n00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.300\nIf you're hosting in AWS it's a different\nstory, because in AWS you pay for\n\n586\n00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.160\nwhat you use.\n\n587\n00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.060\nSo if I take this virtual machine and\n\n588\n00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.310\nsomeone says hey I need another web\nserver Amazon's got tons of resources.\n\n589\n00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.950\nI just provision another when I'm done.\n\n590\n00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.220\nThat's the advantage of using\na public cloud via KWS.\n\n591\n00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.700\n>> You know, I've noticed that you're\nusing a lot of different platforms,\n\n592\n00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:26.580\nwe've got different servers out there,\nwe've got different settings, right?\n\n593\n00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.140\nAnd I can see that if you're\nonly managing a single server,\n\n594\n00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.060\nyou might be able to maintain\nsome consistency, but\n\n595\n00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.710\nwhat happens if you have,\nagain, hundreds, thousands?\n\n596\n00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.050\nThen you couple in software, right?\n\n597\n00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.220\nSoftware needs to have certain parameters,\n\n598\n00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.020\nDon I can see where it starts\nto be administrative complexity\n\n599\n00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:48.590\ntrying to manage some kind of consistency\nacross your entire enterprise environment,\n\n600\n00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.510\ndo you have something for\nus that maybe can help with that?\n\n601\n00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.350\n>> Yeah, especially if you're\nrapidly deploying assets, right?\n\n602\n00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:57.450\nAnd they could be physical,\nnot just virtual right?\n\n603\n00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:02.240\nLet's say that, let's say Wes I come\nto you and I say look, you manage\n\n604\n00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.620\n100 branch offices, and we need to put a\ndatabase server in every branch office and\n\n605\n00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.470\nit needs to be a physical server,\nwe need dedicated resources.\n\n606\n00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:12.880\nSo now Wes has to deploy a hundred\ndatabase servers across these branches.\n\n607\n00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.090\nWell, they're not virtual, they're\nphysical servers, they gotta configure it.\n\n608\n00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.030\nYou gotta install an operating system,\nyou gotta install the database server,\n\n609\n00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.480\nyou gotta put the data on there,\nyou gotta secure patch and update.\n\n610\n00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.310\nRemember the episode we did on hardening\nsystems, you gotta do that stuff, right?\n\n611\n00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.270\nSo, Does he do it on all 100?\n\n612\n00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.750\nDoes he do it exactly the same on all 100?\n\n613\n00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.780\nAnd then when he deploys them,\nonce they're out in the field,\n\n614\n00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.040\ndid they stay configured that way, or\ndoes somebody get at the machine and\n\n615\n00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.500\nweaken its security somehow?\n\n616\n00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.220\nOr do updates not get applied?\n\n617\n00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.140\nThat's the challenge we\nhave with physical servers.\n\n618\n00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.160\nIt's even worse with virtual servers,\ncuz it's so\n\n619\n00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.920\neasy to rapidly deploy virtual servers.\n\n620\n00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.800\nAnd I showed you in that episode\nwhere you're hardening a system that\n\n621\n00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.560\nwhen you deploy a new image that server's\nup and running in a matter of seconds.\n\n622\n00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.850\nBut it might need updates.\n\n623\n00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:58.300\nThe image that it's based\nupon might be out of date.\n\n624\n00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.680\nAnd if you remember to do\nthe updates that's great.\n\n625\n00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.070\nIf you forget to do the updates though\nyou just deployed an unpatched server\n\n626\n00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.420\nright into production\nin a matter of seconds.\n\n627\n00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.170\nAnd that's a double-edged sword, right?\n\n628\n00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:13.260\nOn a positive side, you could react to\nperformance issues instantaneously.\n\n629\n00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.680\nBut on a negative side, you could\nbe deploying non-secured systems,\n\n630\n00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.610\nyour systems that haven't\nbeen prepared properly.\n\n631\n00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:22.150\nSo one of the cool things\nthat you'll wanna do,\n\n632\n00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.960\nand I say cool,\nit's governance and compliance.\n\n633\n00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.040\nAnd these are two words\nthat never talk Never\n\n634\n00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.255\nuse the word cool unless\nit's preceded by not.\n\n635\n00:30:30.255 --> 00:30:32.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, governance and compliance.\n\n636\n00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.380\nThat's where you've got to\nmonitor your systems and\n\n637\n00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.130\nmake sure they're in compliance\nwith what your security policy is.\n\n638\n00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:42.960\nSo if I have a security policy that\nsays all critical security updates\n\n639\n00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.400\nmust be applied within 24 hours, right,\nif it's a security update, 24 hours.\n\n640\n00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.350\nThat's the longest I'll let\na system run with that.\n\n641\n00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:54.280\nIf it's a feature update or an optional,\nmaybe we do three weeks on that.\n\n642\n00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.620\nBut a security update's gotta be 24 hours.\n\n643\n00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:01.950\nAnd if say that a software firewall has\nto be enabled on every server virtual and\n\n644\n00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.600\nphysical, you've gotta have\na software firewall enabled.\n\n645\n00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.140\nAnd it's got to block certain ports.\n\n646\n00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.690\nIt only has to allow SSH to\nconnect from these source IPs.\n\n647\n00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:14.830\nThese are security policies that\nwe create in our companies.\n\n648\n00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.700\nAnd it's easy to say,\nI'm about to deploy the server,\n\n649\n00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.740\nlet me make sure it matches\nthe security policy.\n\n650\n00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.870\nBut then over time, we start to deviate.\n\n651\n00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:25.220\nAnd so in addition to inventory\nmanagement, asset management,\n\n652\n00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:30.420\nin addition to that stuff,\nwe also wanna do compliance management.\n\n653\n00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.210\nWe want to make sure that our systems are\nconfigured and properly adhering to our\n\n654\n00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:38.550\npolicies, and so that's called\nconfiguration standardization.\n\n655\n00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:41.590\nWe want to make sure that all our systems\nhave a standard configuration and\n\n656\n00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.320\nthat they meet our policies.\n\n657\n00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.040\nAnd you can do it by hand you can\nhave a checklist if you want.\n\n658\n00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.170\nI've worked in that kind of environment\nwhere hey I'm deploying a new\n\n659\n00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:49.170\nserver here's my checklist.\n\n660\n00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:50.470\nLet me just run down the list.\n\n661\n00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.244\nI did this, I did this, I did this.\n\n662\n00:31:52.244 --> 00:31:55.873\nBy having a checklist it makes sure\nyou don't miss any steps, right.\n\n663\n00:31:55.873 --> 00:31:57.382\nThere might be 100 steps to do.\n\n664\n00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:59.957\nAnd if you're an expert,\nif you've done it 1000 times,\n\n665\n00:31:59.957 --> 00:32:01.748\nyou could still forget one of those steps.\n\n666\n00:32:01.748 --> 00:32:04.800\nAnd just forgetting one thing could\nlead to a security breech, and\n\n667\n00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.290\nyou definitely don't want that.\n\n668\n00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.830\nBut if you're like me,\nyou just don't trust that,\n\n669\n00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:12.330\nyou just don't trust that people\nare gonna do what they say they do.\n\n670\n00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.190\nAnd you know for sure that once it's\ndeployed, the system gets out of your\n\n671\n00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.300\nhands and other people get in it, and\nthen who knows what happen, right?\n\n672\n00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.120\nIt could be unauthorized\npeople that hack into the box.\n\n673\n00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.230\nIt could be internal employees\nsupporting the server and\n\n674\n00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.880\nthey just do something dumb and\nnow the server is vulnerable.\n\n675\n00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.790\nSo, we usually leverage some\nthird party software to monitor\n\n676\n00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:29.330\nthese dynamically, too.\n\n677\n00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:33.730\nI always call it,\nit's like have a security officer,\n\n678\n00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:37.270\nan IT security officer\nthat's working 24/7.\n\n679\n00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:41.670\nIf I were to hire somebody, so\nput yourself in this position.\n\n680\n00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.872\nIf I were to hire you as a security\nofficer for my company and\n\n681\n00:32:44.872 --> 00:32:46.430\nI said I want you to\nmonitor the servers and\n\n682\n00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:51.070\nmake sure they're compliant, okay, and\nI want you to do it 24 hours a day.\n\n683\n00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.610\nHow long could you keep that up?\n\n684\n00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:54.160\nTwo, three days,\nyou've gotta sleep sooner or later.\n\n685\n00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.770\nYou can only drink so much coffee.\n\n686\n00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.150\nIt's hard for somebody to do that.\n\n687\n00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.625\nSo if I were to hire you,\nI could get, let's say,\n\n688\n00:32:59.625 --> 00:33:02.790\neight to ten hours of work out of\nyou any given day, and only so\n\n689\n00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:05.670\nmuch in a given week, and\nyou monitor those systems.\n\n690\n00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.020\nOne by one you go to each server,\nrunning through your checklist, and\n\n691\n00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.600\nthen when you're done you just\ngo back to the first one again.\n\n692\n00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.460\nIf you had 1000 servers,\n\n693\n00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.500\nyou could probably only get to\neach server every couple of days.\n\n694\n00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.600\nAnd so,\nit would be a few days in-between checks.\n\n695\n00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:24.196\nAnd I'd probably have to pay you a lot of\nmoney, let's say $100,000 a year, right?\n\n696\n00:33:24.196 --> 00:33:29.137\nOr, for $100,000 I could buy some of\nthe best compliance software that was out\n\n697\n00:33:29.137 --> 00:33:32.653\nthere and it could run 24 hours a day,\nseven days a week, and\n\n698\n00:33:32.653 --> 00:33:37.185\nit could be scanning every single server\non my network every couple of minutes,\n\n699\n00:33:37.185 --> 00:33:39.050\nand ensuring that compliance.\n\n700\n00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:41.229\nAnd if somebody went and\ndisabled the software firewall,\n\n701\n00:33:41.229 --> 00:33:43.511\nI would immediately get a warning and\nknow about it, right?\n\n702\n00:33:43.511 --> 00:33:46.750\nNow I can be ensure that people\nare adhering to my policy.\n\n703\n00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.880\nAnd one example of that software is,\nI'll pull it up here,\n\n704\n00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.520\nthe McAfee Policy Auditor.\n\n705\n00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.460\nNow I'm not a big fan of McAfee products,\nthis one is technically not McAfee.\n\n706\n00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.950\nRemember that Intel bought McAfee.\n\n707\n00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:00.610\nAnd so now they just brand all\nthe security stuff that way.\n\n708\n00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.310\nSo it's really the Intel policy auditor.\n\n709\n00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:07.480\nAnd it's built on top of another product,\nwhich is the e-policy orchestrator.\n\n710\n00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.320\nAnd it's great technology.\n\n711\n00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.250\nYou can run it.\n\n712\n00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.110\nYou can tell it what\nyour security policy is.\n\n713\n00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.120\nYou tell it the things.\n\n714\n00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:17.500\nLike, the administrator's group\nshould only contain these people.\n\n715\n00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.070\nIf the administrator's group\never contains somebody else?\n\n716\n00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:20.570\nRed flag.\n\n717\n00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.353\nRoot users should not\nbe allowed to SSH in.\n\n718\n00:34:24.353 --> 00:34:25.560\nAnd if that ever happens?\n\n719\n00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.920\nRed flag.\n\n720\n00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.802\nThese IP addresses are the only ones that\nshould be approved to connect in via SSH.\n\n721\n00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:31.941\nIf that ever changes?\n\n722\n00:34:31.941 --> 00:34:32.810\nRed flag.\n\n723\n00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:35.540\nYou get a notification right away.\n\n724\n00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.670\nAnd now when somebody deploys a server,\n\n725\n00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.250\nthey might still have\na checklist they follow.\n\n726\n00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.290\nBut if they miss anything,\nyou'll know right away.\n\n727\n00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:46.580\nSo software like this, it scans your\nsystem, it monitors what's going on,\n\n728\n00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.880\nit checks out what's happening.\n\n729\n00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.040\nAnd that there's ever a deviation,\nit tells you.\n\n730\n00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.400\nAnd it can monitor, also,\nthis one does Windows, Linux, Mac OS, AIX,\n\n731\n00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.990\nit'll monitor all your different systems,\nyou just tell it what your policy is and\n\n732\n00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:03.080\nit monitors it 24 hours a day,\n7 days a week.\n\n733\n00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.478\nI've used this product,\nI've also used Bind View CC,\n\n734\n00:35:05.478 --> 00:35:08.337\nwhich has changed ownership a few times,\nowned by Semantic now and\n\n735\n00:35:08.337 --> 00:35:11.110\nI always make the joke,\nSymantec is where software goes to die.\n\n736\n00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.780\nAnd so in a way,\nthat's what Bind View CC has done.\n\n737\n00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.770\nBut there's plenty of other\nproducts that are out there.\n\n738\n00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:19.640\nThere used to be one that I used called\nScriptLogic that I really liked and\n\n739\n00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.770\nit changed hands a few times.\n\n740\n00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:25.000\nDell owns it now and I think they call\nit the Dell System Administrator or\n\n741\n00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.704\nsomething crazy like that.\n\n742\n00:35:26.704 --> 00:35:27.850\nIt's got a different name.\n\n743\n00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:29.710\nI'll look it up and\nput it in the show notes for you guys.\n\n744\n00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:33.400\nBut it's a good product too and\nI don't think Dell makes it free.\n\n745\n00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.820\nI think they do make you pay for it.\n\n746\n00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.910\nBut just a way to check compliance.\n\n747\n00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.190\nAre all these systems\nfollowing my security policy?\n\n748\n00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:44.110\nSo, we gotta have that in place, because\nyou just can't count on your system\n\n749\n00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:46.740\nstaying compliant and\nyou need to know when that changes.\n\n750\n00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.780\n>> Great information,\nkeep in mind, policies and\n\n751\n00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.580\nprocedures, something that you're\ngonna see in the real world as well\n\n752\n00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.290\nas the Cloud Plus exam so\nyou need to know this stuff.\n\n753\n00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.810\nRemember, asset management,\ncapacity management, and\n\n754\n00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.980\na standardization in your configurations.\n\n755\n00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.220\nGreat information Don,\ndo you have anything else for us?\n\n756\n00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:01.930\n>> That's about it.\n\n757\n00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.680\nWe do have more to talk about,\nsome more ITIL related concepts.\n\n758\n00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.050\nChange configuration management,\nwhich are really important.\n\n759\n00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.320\nWe'll do those in part two.\n\n760\n00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.050\nSo there is a little more to this.\n\n761\n00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.390\nBut these are kind of the key\nconcepts that we've covered today.\n\n762\n00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:13.790\n>> Very good.\nWell stick around,\n\n763\n00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:14.800\nbecause we've got more to come.\n\n764\n00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.600\nBut that's gonna be saved for a part two.\n\n765\n00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.936\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n766\n00:36:18.936 --> 00:36:20.142\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n767\n00:36:20.142 --> 00:36:20.921\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n768\n00:36:20.921 --> 00:36:22.314\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n769\n00:36:22.314 --> 00:36:30.488\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:18.665\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode we're gonna be moving along in our\n\n4\n00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:23.060\nCloud+ training and we're coming back\nat you with a part two of policies and\n\n5\n00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.890\nprocedures and we have Mr.\nDon Pezet here to help us out with that.\n\n6\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.100\nDon, how ya doing today sir?\n\n7\n00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.430\n>> I'm doing just swell Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.480\nAnd I'm glad to be back on the show.\n\n9\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.560\nFor those of you that\nwatched the last one,\n\n10\n00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.380\nyou know that I do have a tendency\nto ramble on a little bit.\n\n11\n00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.460\nSo we talked a quite a bit about asset\nmanagement and a few other things.\n\n12\n00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.690\nAnd one of the concepts that I brought up,\nI had just mentioned it really briefly,\n\n13\n00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.360\nwas change management.\n\n14\n00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.300\nIn this episode we're gonna talk\na little about change management and\n\n15\n00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.620\nconfiguration management and why they're\nso important and how we need to keep\n\n16\n00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.540\ntrack of all the stuff that's going on in\nour network after things are deployed,\n\n17\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.510\nit is a critical thing to track.\n\n18\n00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.290\n>> Now, Don, I'm looking at some of\nthe topics that we have to cover here and\n\n19\n00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.970\nthe first thing that comes to mind is,\nwell change management,\n\n20\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.600\nconfiguration management,\nthey look like they're the same thing.\n\n21\n00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.370\nCan you help us out?\n\n22\n00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.980\nIs there a difference between them?\n\n23\n00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.846\nAll right, I'll tell you guys,\nif you're a network administrator or\n\n24\n00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:11.145\nif you're a systems administrator or\neven if you're a security administrator,\n\n25\n00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:13.421\na lot of times people use\nthese terms interchangeably.\n\n26\n00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:14.796\nChange management,\nconfiguration management.\n\n27\n00:01:14.796 --> 00:01:15.940\nWho cares?\nThey both start with a C.\n\n28\n00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.340\nWe'll just call them the same thing,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.280\nBut they actually are two different things\nand when they're used the way they were\n\n30\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.180\noriginally intended to be used, it's very\nobvious that they're different, right?\n\n31\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.270\nBut the thing is that a lot of\nus use them in ways that they're\n\n32\n00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.870\nnot intended to be used.\n\n33\n00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.740\nThat's not a bad thing.\n\n34\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.900\nIt's because they're so flexible and\nthey're a good concept, but\n\n35\n00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.460\nthere is a difference.\n\n36\n00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.900\nConfiguration management.\n\n37\n00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.430\nBoth of these actually kind of\nstem from project management so\n\n38\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.290\nin a project environment they\nhave very well-defined meanings.\n\n39\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.480\nWhen you kick off a project, a project\nhas this triad of requirements, something\n\n40\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.170\nthat determines how, they call them your\nconstraints, your project constraints.\n\n41\n00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.290\nAnd so\nyour triple constraints are your budget,\n\n42\n00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.090\nwhich is just how much money you have,\nyour schedule, how much time you have, and\n\n43\n00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.210\nthen your requirements,\nwhich is what you're trying to achieve.\n\n44\n00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.180\nSo anytime you set out on a project,\nthose are three things you have to know.\n\n45\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.340\nHow much money can I spend, how much time\ndo I have, and what do I have to get done.\n\n46\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.000\nWell configuration management applies\nto the what I have to get done part.\n\n47\n00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.390\nSo if somebody gives you a project and\n\n48\n00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.980\nthey say we need you to deploy\na online billing system.\n\n49\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.520\nWe need our customers to be able to browse\nthe website, view their account details,\n\n50\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.190\nand pay their bill, right?\n\n51\n00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.550\nWe have to start thinking what we need for\nthat.\n\n52\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.560\nYou need servers.\n\n53\n00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.140\nYou got security,\ncertificates, encryption.\n\n54\n00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.580\nWe need infrastructure for\n\n55\n00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.430\nthat, redundancy,\nall of this stuff that we need.\n\n56\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.950\nAnd it's all gotta fit together\nto create this overall solution.\n\n57\n00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.290\nThat meets the requirements\nof the project, right?\n\n58\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.680\nThat is our requirements.\n\n59\n00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.750\nAnd anytime we deviate\nfrom those requirements,\n\n60\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.850\nit's called configuration management.\n\n61\n00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.300\nThe configuration of our solution,\n\n62\n00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.390\nof our product is meeting\nthe requirements of the project.\n\n63\n00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.720\nAnd if we change that configuration,\nif I say hm, we were gonna deploy SSL and\n\n64\n00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.080\nthen we realized that it's horribly broken\nand instead we needed to use TLS instead.\n\n65\n00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.240\nAnd not just TLS 1.1, we wanna do TLS 1.2.\n\n66\n00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.620\nWell now I'm changing my configuration,\nright, my cost and\n\n67\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.630\nmy schedule still stay the same,\nbut my configuration changes.\n\n68\n00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.790\nAnd that's where configuration\nmanagement comes in.\n\n69\n00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.020\nBecause if we just start arbitrarily\nchanging our configuration,\n\n70\n00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.190\nwe might not be able to meet our\nschedule and our budget any more.\n\n71\n00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.370\nWe might not even be able\nto complete our project or\n\n72\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.180\nproject might no longer be in line with\nwhat the original customer's asking for.\n\n73\n00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.150\nSo maybe we say, you know they called for\nfive servers, but four will do,\n\n74\n00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.640\nlet's just cut off one of those\nservers and save some money.\n\n75\n00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.030\nWell you can do that if you have\nthe customer's approval to do it, right?\n\n76\n00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.490\nAnd that's how it works\nin a project world.\n\n77\n00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.750\nChange management on the other hand\ndoesn't apply to the configuration.\n\n78\n00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.660\nChange management, we're still trying to\ncomplete the configuration as requested\n\n79\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.530\nbut we recognize that we're\nnot gonna meet our budget.\n\n80\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.462\nOr, we recognize that we're\nnot gonna meet our schedule.\n\n81\n00:04:00.462 --> 00:04:03.370\nAnd so we put in a change request to say,\ncan I change that schedule?\n\n82\n00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.730\nCan I change that budget?\n\n83\n00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.920\nCan I have a little more money?\n\n84\n00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.300\nCan I have a little more time?\n\n85\n00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.510\nOr, maybe we're ahead of schedule so\nwe say, can we have less time?\n\n86\n00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.020\nWe're gonna get done early, right?\n\n87\n00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.990\nThat's where change management comes in.\n\n88\n00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.740\nAnd so in a project world\nthat's very important, right.\n\n89\n00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.640\nTwo very distinct separate ideas.\n\n90\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.790\nThe thing is if you're following ITIL\npractices, you'll use change and\n\n91\n00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.430\nconfiguration management\noutside of projects.\n\n92\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.860\nA project has a well defined start and\nan end.\n\n93\n00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.850\nA project starts,\nit achieves a goal and it ends.\n\n94\n00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.965\nBut in the IT world, we have a lot\nof stuff that isn't a project,\n\n95\n00:04:39.965 --> 00:04:42.030\nthat is what's called operations.\n\n96\n00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.587\nAnd with operations that's stuff\nthat goes on every single day.\n\n97\n00:04:44.587 --> 00:04:48.569\nSo I might have a project to bring up a\nweb server but once the web server is up,\n\n98\n00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.741\nthat project is over but the web server\ndoesn't disappear, it stays running,\n\n99\n00:04:52.741 --> 00:04:56.630\nday after day, after day, for\nyears throughout its life cycle, right.\n\n100\n00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.500\nA life cycle is,\nhow we deploy stuff, right.\n\n101\n00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.210\nAnd with a life cycle,\nyou start with kind of a design phase.\n\n102\n00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.505\nYou come up with what you're gonna do.\n\n103\n00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:05.047\nIn fact here,\n\n104\n00:05:05.047 --> 00:05:08.088\nlet me, I'm gonna jump ahead in the notes,\nWes, I'll throw you out of order.\n\n105\n00:05:08.088 --> 00:05:08.846\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So,\n\n106\n00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:10.750\nin ITIL we have this life cycle.\n\n107\n00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.040\nAnd the life cycle really has\nfive kind of pieces to it.\n\n108\n00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.110\nSo, you basically start out\nwith designing a service.\n\n109\n00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.520\nWhat it is that you're gonna do,\nthis design.\n\n110\n00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.690\nAnd then you transition the service.\n\n111\n00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.740\nYou've designed it,\nnow it's time to put it in production.\n\n112\n00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.800\nSo you transition it into production.\n\n113\n00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.860\nAnd then you operate the service,\nit's operations, it's running,\n\n114\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.130\nit's doing its thing, okay.\n\n115\n00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.610\nAll along that process you've got\ncontinual service improvement,\n\n116\n00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.790\nyou're looking for ways to improve it.\n\n117\n00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.970\nAnd what you may find is you define\na solution, you transition it in place and\n\n118\n00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.670\nyou operate it and while it's operating,\nyou recognize areas you can improve.\n\n119\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.030\nMaybe there's a bug or a patch that\nyou find or maybe there's just\n\n120\n00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.000\nsome system you find you can streamline\na little bit and make better.\n\n121\n00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.720\nThat's continual service improvement and\nso, you go right back to design again and\n\n122\n00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.520\nyou start over and you say, let me\ndesign this improvement and then you\n\n123\n00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.920\ntransition the improvement into production\nand then you operate with the improvement.\n\n124\n00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.260\nAnd then you continue to look for areas.\n\n125\n00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.140\nYou continually improve until you finally\nreach the end when you decommission\n\n126\n00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.740\nthat service and\n\n127\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.600\nreplace it with something new, which\nreally is just the design phase again.\n\n128\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.760\nYou design the replacement, and transition\nit in the production and operate it.\n\n129\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.060\nAnd this is all built\naround a service strategy.\n\n130\n00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.940\nThese words that I'm saying, these\nare all like the official ITIL terms.\n\n131\n00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.150\nSo the service strategy, that's your IT\ndepartment's big strategy, their big goal,\n\n132\n00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.270\nthe big picture.\n\n133\n00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.810\nSo I might be deploying a web server,\nand that's all I see.\n\n134\n00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.160\nBut the big goal is to provide\nbanking services to my clients, right?\n\n135\n00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.450\nOr if you're an insurance company, my big\ngoal is to sell and insure my clients.\n\n136\n00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.660\nMy goal isn't to have a web server,\nI don't care about the web server, but\n\n137\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.580\nit's providing a piece that when\nassembled with everything else,\n\n138\n00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.920\nachieve's my bigger goal of providing\ninsurance to the customers.\n\n139\n00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.640\nSo in the IT world we oftentimes\nfixate on our infrastructure\n\n140\n00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.790\nwhen in reality the big picture\nis completely different.\n\n141\n00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.762\nThere's employees at Amazon whose\nsole responsibility is to keep\n\n142\n00:07:02.762 --> 00:07:03.671\ndatabases online.\n\n143\n00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:08.680\nThey don't care that the new Harry Potter\nbook is out, or something like that.\n\n144\n00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.796\nThey don't care about that.\n\n145\n00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:11.590\nThere's a database and\nthat's what they care about.\n\n146\n00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.740\nBut that's just one piece of the puzzle.\n\n147\n00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.510\nAnd that's all part of the life cycle for\nour company.\n\n148\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.560\nWhen you deploy a product, it may\ndeploy in one form and then it changes.\n\n149\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.490\nConfiguration change, regular change\nmanagement, and then eventually it dies.\n\n150\n00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.430\nIt goes away and\nget's replaced by something else.\n\n151\n00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.720\nBut during that whole time that it's\noperating, we need to track and\n\n152\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.780\nmanage changes.\n\n153\n00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.460\nWe're not in a project.\n\n154\n00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.770\nWe're doing ongoing operations.\n\n155\n00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.160\nAnd those ongoing operations,\nwe can still use change manager,\n\n156\n00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.490\nwe can still use configuration manager.\n\n157\n00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.600\nBut they loose some of their bond.\n\n158\n00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.910\nCuz we don't have a schedule or\na set budget anymore.\n\n159\n00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.540\nNow, it's just operational costs.\n\n160\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.990\nAnd so, that's why so\nmany people use the terms interchangeably.\n\n161\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.790\nIn a project, well defined, separation.\n\n162\n00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.237\nVery, very defined meanings.\n\n163\n00:07:54.237 --> 00:07:57.450\nBut outside of a project,\nthey do become somewhat interchangeable.\n\n164\n00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.265\nSo be careful with that on the exam cuz\nthey may call you out on being very\n\n165\n00:08:00.265 --> 00:08:02.152\nspecific as far as what\nis change management.\n\n166\n00:08:02.152 --> 00:08:03.685\nVersus what is configuration management.\n\n167\n00:08:03.685 --> 00:08:08.053\nConfiguration management is usually really\neasy to identify, because when they're\n\n168\n00:08:08.053 --> 00:08:12.140\ntalking about what they're changing,\nthey'll normally call it a CI, right?\n\n169\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.440\nAnd a CI,\nit's one of those change management\n\n170\n00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.470\nkind of terms that you'll see which\nis just a configuration item?\n\n171\n00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.706\n>> There we go.\nThank you, West,\n\n172\n00:08:22.706 --> 00:08:23.990\nI just had a brain freeze there.\n\n173\n00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.240\nA configuration item.\n\n174\n00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.930\nAnd so when you say you're gonna change\nsomething, it's a particular item.\n\n175\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.790\nAnd your product that you're producing is\nreally just a whole list of configuration\n\n176\n00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.030\nitems, right?\n\n177\n00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.630\nAnd so if we're gonna deploy something,\n\n178\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:41.170\nout the items that we use are all\njust kind of a part of that.\n\n179\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.920\nLet me bring up, I was talking to\nWes earlier about configurations,\n\n180\n00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.980\nand I've got a little document that I\nhad made a few years ago for, I worked\n\n181\n00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.050\nat a company that had, was deploying\nLinux serves on top of Citrix XenServer.\n\n182\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.950\nAnd they hadn't really\nworked with Linux a lot.\n\n183\n00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.690\nAnd so I said, you know what,\nlet me put together a document for\n\n184\n00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.520\nyou, and what I'm going to do is tell you,\n\n185\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.540\nhere are the steps you go through\nto deploy a Linux server.\n\n186\n00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.400\nAny Linux server in your environment,\nthese are the steps you go through, right?\n\n187\n00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.810\nSo let me bring this document up,\nso I've got it right here.\n\n188\n00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.870\nAnd can we make that bigger so\nit's actually legible?\n\n189\n00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.950\nAnd so basically I just started\noff with saying perform a minimal\n\n190\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.490\nOS install, right?\n\n191\n00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.850\nDepending on your Linux distro,\n\n192\n00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.490\nthey almost all have a minimal\ninstall you can do, which means\n\n193\n00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.640\ndon't install any extra software,\njust install the bare stuff you need.\n\n194\n00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.930\nAnd then I said, jump in and\nconfigure your network interface, right?\n\n195\n00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.810\nHere's the command.\n\n196\n00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.736\nRun\nvi/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-e-\n\n197\n00:09:32.736 --> 00:09:33.638\nth0.\nAnd then,\n\n198\n00:09:33.638 --> 00:09:35.151\nhere's the data you need to change.\n\n199\n00:09:35.151 --> 00:09:38.460\nThis x becomes the IP address\nof that machine, right?\n\n200\n00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.760\nAnd punch that data in.\n\n201\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.740\nAnd then make sure the network\nis set to start at boot time.\n\n202\n00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.530\nIf you do a minimal install, it's not,\nand so here's the command to do that.\n\n203\n00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:46.590\nAnd then assign a host name.\n\n204\n00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.120\nAnd then so here you go in and edit it.\n\n205\n00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.870\nYou probably don't wanna\ncall it dons.machine.com.\n\n206\n00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.440\nDisable IPv6,\nbecause this company wasn't using IPv6.\n\n207\n00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.160\nSo here's how you disable it.\n\n208\n00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.950\nPerform all updates.\n\n209\n00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.040\nThen they used Webmin.\n\n210\n00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.300\nThey weren't experienced with Linux.\n\n211\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.370\nThey wanted a web\nmanagement to control it.\n\n212\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.670\nSo here's how you install Webmin, these\nare the steps you go through to deploy it.\n\n213\n00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.070\nWell, each one of these is a CI,\neach one of these is a configuration item.\n\n214\n00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.400\nAnd so down the road they might say,\nyou know we are gonna start using IPv6.\n\n215\n00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.590\nSo this step 5 here, disable IPv6,\nwe don't want to do that anymore.\n\n216\n00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.820\nNow we want to change it.\n\n217\n00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:25.380\nWe wanna change it, so just like with\nIPv4, we apply an IPv6 configuration.\n\n218\n00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.610\nAnd so, as part of configuration\nmanagement, they go in and alter this CI.\n\n219\n00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.000\nThe whole rest of the list stays the same,\n\n220\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.660\nall these other steps stay the same,\nbut this CI becomes different.\n\n221\n00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.980\nSo this checklist becomes\nour deployment policy.\n\n222\n00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.040\nHere's our policy, when you deploy\na server, here's the steps you follow.\n\n223\n00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.610\nWe might do compliance checks to\nmake sure that we followed this, and\n\n224\n00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:53.430\nthen we do configuration management\nanytime we want to change it.\n\n225\n00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.120\nNow configuration management\nmeans you can't just go and\n\n226\n00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.170\nchange this stuff whenever you want.\n\n227\n00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.760\nYou can't just go in and modify these,\nyou've got to get it approved.\n\n228\n00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.740\nThere has to be a board\nthat we go through.\n\n229\n00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.050\nIt's important that we have that process\nin place, because when people start making\n\n230\n00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.120\ntheir own changes,\nyou don't know if they've done testing.\n\n231\n00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.948\nYou don't know if they\nverify that it worked.\n\n232\n00:11:11.948 --> 00:11:14.750\nYou don't know if they've checked to\nensure that it doesn't interfere with\n\n233\n00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:15.950\nother systems.\n\n234\n00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.310\nAnd that's a key piece of\nconfiguration management.\n\n235\n00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:23.310\nUsually configuration management is\ncoupled with what's called a CMDB,\n\n236\n00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.240\na configuration management database,\nall right?\n\n237\n00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.090\nAnd what a configuration\nmanagement database does\n\n238\n00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.010\nis it takes the configuration\nof each of your systems and\n\n239\n00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.830\nit maps out the inter-relations to them,\nright?\n\n240\n00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.390\nAnd what do I mean by the inter-relations?\n\n241\n00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:41.070\nWell, here I'm tracking the configuration\nof deploying a Linux host, right, so\n\n242\n00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.560\nI deploy a Linux machine,\nthis is the configuration.\n\n243\n00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.620\nBut what if it's a web server or\nwhat if it's an email server?\n\n244\n00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.290\nI'm going to put different\nsoftware on top.\n\n245\n00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.470\nAnd if I put an email\nservice on top of it,\n\n246\n00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.560\nit may have different requirements than\nif I put a web server on top of it.\n\n247\n00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.120\nAnd I might have to weaken the security a\nlittle bit for that email server, but for\n\n248\n00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.880\nthe web server I wanna\nkeep it really strict.\n\n249\n00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.380\nThere's differences, alright, but\n\n250\n00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:08.420\nthey're both linked to this configuration,\nfor the server under the hood.\n\n251\n00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.310\nAnd if I change this configuration,\nwhat does that do to the web server,\n\n252\n00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.870\nwhat does that do to the mail server?\n\n253\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.511\nIf I decide to make a configuration change\nto the underlying OS and enable IPv6,\n\n254\n00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:21.635\nis my web server gonna handle IPv6?\n\n255\n00:12:21.635 --> 00:12:22.770\nI don't know.\n\n256\n00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.160\nIs my email server gonna handle IPv6?\n\n257\n00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.305\nI don't know.\n\n258\n00:12:25.305 --> 00:12:29.900\nSo we see a CMDB that says,\n\n259\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.860\nif you modify this server configuration,\nhere's the other configurations that\n\n260\n00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.090\nrely upon that, that build upon that, and\nyou need to go and check them too, rIght?\n\n261\n00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.000\nAnd that way we ensure\nthat a change in one place\n\n262\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.020\ndoesn't break something somewhere else.\n\n263\n00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.830\nIf you work in IT,\nyou've experienced this.\n\n264\n00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.680\nYou know, hey, this is broken,\nlet me fix that.\n\n265\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.180\nAnd then all of a sudden\nthe red lights light up and\n\n266\n00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.230\nthere's stuff broken all across the board.\n\n267\n00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.200\nYou look at a server and you say, somebody\ndisabled the fire wall on this thing.\n\n268\n00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.770\nWhy would they do that,\nlet me just turn that back on.\n\n269\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.960\nAnd then all of a sudden\nsomething breaks and\n\n270\n00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.960\nyou're like they turned the firewall\noff because they're idiots.\n\n271\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.280\nAnd you have to go and find out why.\n\n272\n00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.875\nLike, they couldn't take the time to\nfigure out which port to open up in\n\n273\n00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:11.110\nthe firewall so\nthey just turned the damn thing off.\n\n274\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.110\nThen you end up with no firewall, right?\n\n275\n00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.840\nSo now we've gotta go and figure that out.\n\n276\n00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.360\nChange management, or\nconfiguration management, and\n\n277\n00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.630\na configuration management\ndatabase helps to prevent that.\n\n278\n00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:24.570\nTo say, if you're gonna make a change,\nwe've gotta get it approved.\n\n279\n00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.480\nAnd while we're approving it,\nwe can look at the interrelations and\n\n280\n00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.870\nsee where there's a break, if there's\nanything else that might be affected.\n\n281\n00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.250\nWe can create a cascading failure across\nthe network, and we can be proactive and\n\n282\n00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.140\nstop it before it happens.\n\n283\n00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.110\nBecause you don't want to do that.\n\n284\n00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.120\nYou don't want to make a change and\nbreak something.\n\n285\n00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.690\nThat's what configuration\nmanagement is all about.\n\n286\n00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.880\nAll right, so,\nit's up to our company to implement that.\n\n287\n00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.620\nTo make sure that we've got good\nconfiguration management in place,\n\n288\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.640\nthat we're tracking it.\n\n289\n00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.730\nAnd if you've got compliance management,\n\n290\n00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:54.020\nif you're tracking your systems to make\nsure they're compliant, then it's easy to\n\n291\n00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.150\nspot when somebody deviates from the\nconfiguration, and you can correct that.\n\n292\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.790\nBut if they have a reason for\nit, they have a reason for\n\n293\n00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.760\nthat change, they need to\nsubmit a configuration request,\n\n294\n00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.100\na configuration change request,\nand get that put in place.\n\n295\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.780\nChange management, same basic idea.\n\n296\n00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.520\nChange management is where we come in and\nwe say, hey,\n\n297\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.410\nI want to make a change to the system.\n\n298\n00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.970\nAnd that change might be cost-related,\n\n299\n00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.370\nit might be schedule-related\nif it's in a project.\n\n300\n00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.060\nBut if we're outside of the project,\n\n301\n00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:25.040\nit's normally a change that's not\nrelated to the configuration.\n\n302\n00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.844\nAnd I know what you're thinking.\n\n303\n00:14:26.844 --> 00:14:27.580\nThat's really confusing, Don.\n\n304\n00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.310\nWhy would you say that?\n\n305\n00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.260\nWell, let me give you an example.\n\n306\n00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:35.810\nLet's say that I have a server and\nI've noticed that it's got a memory leak.\n\n307\n00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.540\nThere's a memory leak in it,\nand so it's got a problem.\n\n308\n00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.670\nThere's a bug in the software,\nand as a result I need to\n\n309\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:46.330\nreboot the server to free up memory\nbefore it runs out of memory, right?\n\n310\n00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.640\nI know the real fix is to patch\nthe software that's leaking, right.\n\n311\n00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.570\nAnd patching the software is\ngonna require a change, and\n\n312\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.420\nmove that software to another version.\n\n313\n00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.690\nAnd when that software moves to another\nversion, that may affect other systems,\n\n314\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.260\nand that's part of\nconfiguration management.\n\n315\n00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.920\nBut if I just want to reboot it\nto free up memory right now, so\n\n316\n00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.290\nthat I can have an outage on my schedule\ninstead of on its schedule, right?\n\n317\n00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.660\nI want to reboot it right now.\n\n318\n00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.040\nWell, that's a change too.\n\n319\n00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.974\nThe server was on,\nI'm about to make it off.\n\n320\n00:15:12.974 --> 00:15:14.650\n[LAUGH] And that's a change.\n\n321\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.580\nAnd so I need to do a change ticket\nthat explains what I'm doing,\n\n322\n00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.120\nthat says I've identified a problem.\n\n323\n00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.600\nHere's the research that I've\ndone that shows the problem.\n\n324\n00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.320\nAnd here's what I'm gonna do to fix it.\n\n325\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.190\nThis is my plan.\n\n326\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.690\nThis is when I'm gonna do it.\n\n327\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.790\nAll right, that's change management.\n\n328\n00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.950\nAnd you don't want to just do this as\nthe wild West, you just go in and do it.\n\n329\n00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.520\nIf you work in a department where\nyou've only got one or two IT people,\n\n330\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.230\nyou can just talk to each other, right?\n\n331\n00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.120\nSo you say, hey Wes,\nI'm gonna reboot this server, just FYI.\n\n332\n00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.800\nIf you start getting calls,\nit's rebooting, right?\n\n333\n00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.881\nBut if I've got 20 administrators, or if\nI've got people who are working from home,\n\n334\n00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:52.672\nI'm going to reboot this server,\nand I guess they'll find out.\n\n335\n00:15:52.672 --> 00:15:53.984\nAnd so they start getting calls.\n\n336\n00:15:53.984 --> 00:15:55.342\nHey, why is this down,why is this down?\n\n337\n00:15:55.342 --> 00:15:56.190\nAnd they don't know.\n\n338\n00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.782\nAnd they've got to start jumping in and\ntrying to fix it,\n\n339\n00:15:58.782 --> 00:16:02.670\nand all the sudden They're in the system\nworking on it while you're making changes,\n\n340\n00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.750\nand now you're butting heads, right?\n\n341\n00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.162\nAnd things are just not working.\n\n342\n00:16:06.162 --> 00:16:07.972\nAnd you're kind of undoing the work or\n\n343\n00:16:07.972 --> 00:16:10.696\nthey're undoing the work that\nyou're trying to put in.\n\n344\n00:16:10.696 --> 00:16:13.235\nAnd that's why we've gotta\nhave good communications, and\n\n345\n00:16:13.235 --> 00:16:15.034\nChange Management does that, all right?\n\n346\n00:16:15.034 --> 00:16:19.606\nThe first key concept with Change\nManagement is that we introduced a CAB,\n\n347\n00:16:19.606 --> 00:16:21.500\na Change Advisory Board.\n\n348\n00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.700\nThere's different names.\n\n349\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.889\nYou'll have, some people call it\na configuration board or whatever.\n\n350\n00:16:25.889 --> 00:16:30.495\nBut a Change Advisory Board or\na CAB is one of the more common names.\n\n351\n00:16:30.495 --> 00:16:34.284\n>> Now with the Change Advisory Board\nis that commonly made up of people\n\n352\n00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:36.943\nlike stakeholders, shareholders and stuff,\n\n353\n00:16:36.943 --> 00:16:40.920\nthat have an invested interest in\nthe company or not always or at all?\n\n354\n00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.220\n>> In a project, it would be.\n\n355\n00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.420\n>> Okay.\n>> But the outside of a project,\n\n356\n00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.460\nyou don't have stakeholders when\nyou're outside of a project, right?\n\n357\n00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.383\nSo what you would do is you would make\nit up out of usually at least one\n\n358\n00:16:50.383 --> 00:16:52.212\nrepresentative from the IT Department,\n\n359\n00:16:52.212 --> 00:16:55.156\nbecause you need somebody with\ntechnical knowledge on the board.\n\n360\n00:16:55.156 --> 00:16:57.829\nYou'd usually have one representative\nfrom your security team,\n\n361\n00:16:57.829 --> 00:17:00.226\nbecause you've gotta have\nsomeone with security in mind.\n\n362\n00:17:00.226 --> 00:17:04.483\nAnd the rest of the representatives would\nbe made up of people from accounting and\n\n363\n00:17:04.483 --> 00:17:06.424\nthe departments that are affected,\n\n364\n00:17:06.424 --> 00:17:09.330\nthe people who would be\nimpacted by this change.\n\n365\n00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:14.880\nSo if I worked for a bank and I have\na web based mortgage lending system,\n\n366\n00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.020\nI need to have somebody from the mortgage\ndepartment and from the underwriting\n\n367\n00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.910\ndepartment, because these are the people\nthat use that system every single day.\n\n368\n00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.200\nAnd if I'm about to make a change, to\nan IT guy like me, I might not care, and\n\n369\n00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.870\nsay, we're gonna update to the latest\nversion of software it's more secure.\n\n370\n00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.384\nAnd by the way,\nit requires Internet Explorer 11.\n\n371\n00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.850\nAnd that's it,\nwe don't support Firefox or Chrome or\n\n372\n00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.670\nlower versions of Internet Explorer, and\nso that's what we're gonna roll out, and\n\n373\n00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.890\nI'm fine with that.\n\n374\n00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.140\nBut then we go to the change board and\nwe say what we're gonna do, and\n\n375\n00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:47.130\nthe underwriting team says, whoa, wait\na minute we just bought 1000 laptops and\n\n376\n00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.660\nthey've all got\nInternet Explorer 10 on it.\n\n377\n00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.510\nOr boy we hate Internet Explorer,\nwe just use Firefox, and\n\n378\n00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.980\nyou're about to take\naway our Firefox support.\n\n379\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.050\nAnd now, as the IT guy,\n\n380\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.050\nwell it didn't bother me but\nI see it's a problem for you.\n\n381\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.280\n>> So the committee is more just\na completely inter-departmental, and\n\n382\n00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.390\nit has to be it seems like,\n\n383\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:09.480\ncuz that makes sense that all those\nbrand new laptops now are out of date.\n\n384\n00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.823\nThey're not really out of date, but\nthey're not configured correctly anymore.\n\n385\n00:18:12.823 --> 00:18:14.070\n>> Let me give you a real world example.\n\n386\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.930\nThis is one that happened\nto me a few years ago is,\n\n387\n00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:20.200\nI had some servers that I needed to do\nmaintenance on, just routine maintenance.\n\n388\n00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.030\nI knew that I could save a little memory\non them, get them running a little faster,\n\n389\n00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.910\nso it was optional maintenance,\nit was something I was chosing to do.\n\n390\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:30.700\nSo I filled out my change ticket, and\nI said I wanna come in on a Saturday,\n\n391\n00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.140\nand I'll just come in at 6AM and\nI'll put in this change,\n\n392\n00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.740\nknowing that the company was closed at\n6AM, and so I could get in there and\n\n393\n00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.380\nmake that change that really\nwouldn't impact anybody, right?\n\n394\n00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.035\nSo I put in that ticket, and\nthen my ticket got rejected, and\n\n395\n00:18:43.035 --> 00:18:46.107\nI was like well that sucks, I was\nkinda like volunteering to come in and\n\n396\n00:18:46.107 --> 00:18:48.160\ndo this stuff on the weekend,\nwhat happened?\n\n397\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.895\nAnd the reason it was rejected was that\nsomebody in the underwriting department\n\n398\n00:18:51.895 --> 00:18:54.568\nwas at that meeting, and\nthey said whoa, wait a minute,\n\n399\n00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:56.368\nwe're actually backed up right now.\n\n400\n00:18:56.368 --> 00:19:00.351\nAnd so we're bringing in our\nteam on Saturday to get ahead,\n\n401\n00:19:00.351 --> 00:19:02.262\nto catch up on our backlog and\n\n402\n00:19:02.262 --> 00:19:07.570\nprocess some of the adjustments that\nhave been coming into the company.\n\n403\n00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.310\nAnd I didn't know that because\nI'm not an underwriter.\n\n404\n00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.600\nI don't care when they work,\nI'm the IT guy, I run the servers, right?\n\n405\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.100\nSo I know the company's\nclosed on Saturday but\n\n406\n00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.560\nthey had scheduled weekend\nwork that I didn't know about.\n\n407\n00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.970\nAnd so they told me.\n\n408\n00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.930\nSo it wasn't that my change was\nrejected like, you can't do that.\n\n409\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.970\nIt was, you just can't do it on that day.\n\n410\n00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.870\nSo if you wanna do it,\ncan you come in on Sunday and\n\n411\n00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.070\ndo it, or maybe the next Saturday,\nand that's exactly what I did.\n\n412\n00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.900\nI just moved it to the next Saturday,\nI didn't care.\n\n413\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.640\nSo you move it, but it avoided a disaster.\n\n414\n00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.420\nI could have come in that Saturday\nknowing the company was closed and\n\n415\n00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.400\nstarted making that change, and they could\nhave had 20 underwriters show up to work,\n\n416\n00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.620\nand the system would have been offline.\n\n417\n00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.490\nAnd they're like great, we came in on the\nweekend, and we can't even do our work?\n\n418\n00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.520\nAnd it was just cuz there's not that\nlevel of communication normally.\n\n419\n00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.790\nBut the Change Advisory Board\nserved it's purpose there.\n\n420\n00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.610\nAnd it let me know about that and\nit let us avoid an outage.\n\n421\n00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.622\nThat's what this is all about, right?\n\n422\n00:19:55.622 --> 00:19:58.115\nThat's why Change Advisory Boards are so\nimportant, all right?\n\n423\n00:19:58.115 --> 00:20:01.180\nNow when you fill out a change ticket,\nI've got a sample here.\n\n424\n00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.310\nJust a change request template.\n\n425\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.770\nI use this in our project\nmanagement shows.\n\n426\n00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.700\nIf you ever watch our PMP series,\nI use this a lot.\n\n427\n00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.040\nBut basically a change\nrequest boils down to this,\n\n428\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.000\nyou have to provide some basic information\nabout what it is you're doing.\n\n429\n00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.460\nAnd so normally you're gonna give a\ndetailed description of the change, okay?\n\n430\n00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.920\nSo this is what I wanna do, right?\n\n431\n00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.610\nAnd for that example I gave a minute\nago with the insurance company,\n\n432\n00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:30.510\nwhat I was wanting to do was move some\nsoftware from one server to another.\n\n433\n00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.820\nSo I had one physical server that only\nhad, I think it had four processors, and\n\n434\n00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.790\nI wanted to move it to a system\nthat had eight processors.\n\n435\n00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.200\nAnd that way it would have\nsome more CPU available to it.\n\n436\n00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.500\nAnd it would perform better.\n\n437\n00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.570\nSo that's why I put in my change.\n\n438\n00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:44.570\nSo I put you know I wanna move the image\nright front end from this server over to\n\n439\n00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.100\nanother server, okay?\n\n440\n00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.760\nAnd then justification for\nproposed change.\n\n441\n00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.300\nHere's where I put in the existing\nservers been logging about 80% CPU\n\n442\n00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.610\nutilization on average every single day.\n\n443\n00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.065\nIf I move it over to the new system,\n\n444\n00:20:58.065 --> 00:21:01.200\nthat'll drop us down to less than\n40% CPU utilization everyday,\n\n445\n00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.370\nwhich will give us plenty of room to\ngrow and plenty of room to spike.\n\n446\n00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.120\nAnd so that's what I put in there.\n\n447\n00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.010\nImpact of change.\n\n448\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.400\nFor the impact of change I put,\n\n449\n00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.900\nwhile I'm making the change\nthe entire system will be offline.\n\n450\n00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.460\nThe change will take approximately two\nhours, so for two hours we're gonna have\n\n451\n00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.650\nan outage, that's the impact and\nit's gonna impact anybody in\n\n452\n00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:23.780\nthe adjusting department, the underwriting\ndepartment and, it was years ago now so\n\n453\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.140\nI can't remember, there was one\nother department that was affected.\n\n454\n00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.970\nIf you were in accounting you didn't care,\n\n455\n00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.940\nif you were in the mail room you\ndidn't care, but if you were in\n\n456\n00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.510\nthese other departments these are the\npeople that would be impacted, right?\n\n457\n00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.850\nAnd then I just put in any other comments,\n\n458\n00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.560\nI don't remember if I had any comments,\nI usually do.\n\n459\n00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.980\nSo then, this can go before the board.\n\n460\n00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.090\nNow there's usually a few other\nsteps that we might include in here.\n\n461\n00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.750\nThings like a rollback plan.\n\n462\n00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.000\nWhat if i screw it up?\n\n463\n00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.440\nWhat if I'm moving this software over and\na problem happens?\n\n464\n00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.440\nYou put a roll back plan in, right?\n\n465\n00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.230\nRoll back plans are really important.\n\n466\n00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.540\nI know one of the gentlemen that I worked\nwith is a brilliant guy, just really,\n\n467\n00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.300\nreally smart, and he did a lot of work.\n\n468\n00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.840\nHe really just got a lot\ndone in any given week, but\n\n469\n00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.310\nyou always knew when he was about\nto go on vacation, because for\n\n470\n00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.880\none week he would just do\nan amazing amount of work.\n\n471\n00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.170\nHe would double his effort\nthe week before going on vacation,\n\n472\n00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.090\nand then he'd go on vacation.\n\n473\n00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:18.130\nAnd so he's a company guy,\nreally dedicated to the company.\n\n474\n00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:22.460\nThe problem was he'd put in a ton of\nchanges, and then he'd go on vacation.\n\n475\n00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.720\nAnd I'd come in on Monday, and\nthere'd be red lights all over the place.\n\n476\n00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.640\nPeople are going crazy.\n\n477\n00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.430\nThis software's not working,\nthis isn't right, my icons are missing,\n\n478\n00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:33.770\nthe color of the webpage is wrong,\nit was just crazy stuff.\n\n479\n00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:37.080\nAnd I would have to sit there and\nreverse engineer the changes he did.\n\n480\n00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.890\nWhat the heck happened on Friday\nthat's making Monday so bad?\n\n481\n00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.700\nAnd I would just have to start undoing it.\n\n482\n00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.570\nAnd in the early days before we had\nchange management, it was a nightmare.\n\n483\n00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.440\nI hated it when he went on vacation.\n\n484\n00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.970\nAnd so once we had change\nmanagement it was a lot easier.\n\n485\n00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.320\nCuz on that Monday I can just come in and\n\n486\n00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.990\nsay all right let me pull\nthe change tickets for Friday.\n\n487\n00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.370\nWhat was approved?\n\n488\n00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.540\nAnd then go through and here's the one\nthat's effecting this, let me just roll it\n\n489\n00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.320\nback, and then he can sort it out when\nhe gets back from vacation, right?\n\n490\n00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.490\nAnd now I've got the steps to roll back.\n\n491\n00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:05.350\nSo a roll back plan or\na back out plan is really nice to have.\n\n492\n00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.210\nIt also shows that you've\ndone your research.\n\n493\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.630\nThis isn't some change that\nI'm willy nilly throwing in.\n\n494\n00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.270\nIt's something that I've\nreally thought out.\n\n495\n00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:13.500\nI've tested it.\n\n496\n00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.470\nI've shown that it works, and\n\n497\n00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.760\nhere's how you can undo it\nif there's a problem, right?\n\n498\n00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.990\nOr if it doesn't work, right, cuz another\npart of this is change validation.\n\n499\n00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:22.720\nHow do we verify the change worked?\n\n500\n00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.650\nSo if I go through the trouble of\nmoving this server to new hardware,\n\n501\n00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.710\nhow do I show that I'm actually\ngetting the benefit of it?\n\n502\n00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.750\nWe need to track that, because if\nwe don't get the benefit out of it,\n\n503\n00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.970\nI need to move it back.\n\n504\n00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.580\nI need to move it back to where it\nwas because I've wasted my time, and\n\n505\n00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.980\nI might need that other hardware for\nsomething else, right?\n\n506\n00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.960\nSo you need to undo changes\nthat don't work, and\n\n507\n00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.310\nthat might be a part of\nyour change ticket also.\n\n508\n00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:44.280\nBut then, at the end of the day, the last\npage is what's important, right here.\n\n509\n00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.824\nThis is where they can approve,\ndefer, or decline the change.\n\n510\n00:23:47.824 --> 00:23:52.344\nIf they approve it, now it's an authorized\nchange, and we've got it on paper here.\n\n511\n00:23:52.344 --> 00:23:54.538\nWe know exactly whats happening and\nwe keep track of it.\n\n512\n00:23:54.538 --> 00:23:56.953\nIf we decline it,\nwe're not gonna make the change.\n\n513\n00:23:56.953 --> 00:24:01.333\nIf we defer it, we're normally gonna\ndefer it to either schedule it for\n\n514\n00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:04.700\na better time or\nto request more information.\n\n515\n00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.090\nMaybe we need some more data about this\nchange than what you've given us and so\n\n516\n00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.120\nwe put in here, in the Justification for\n\n517\n00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.500\nDisposition, here's what I need you to\ngive me before we can approve this change.\n\n518\n00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.130\nAnd then you get your signatures,\nyour change control board signatures.\n\n519\n00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.970\nNow here it's a change control\nboard instead of a change\n\n520\n00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.230\nadvisory board, or whatever.\n\n521\n00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:23.410\nThere's different names\nthat are out there.\n\n522\n00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.110\nThis one's a CCB.\n\n523\n00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.620\nNow I mention we need to have\nmembers of the CCB that are from\n\n524\n00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.980\nmultiple departments.\n\n525\n00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.840\nIt can be really hard to\nget those people together.\n\n526\n00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.760\nRight?\nEspecially if it's\n\n527\n00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.270\nseveral different departments for\na large company.\n\n528\n00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:39.340\nSo you might only have a CAB meeting,\nChange Advisory Board,\n\n529\n00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.650\na CAB meeting once a week.\n\n530\n00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.530\nIf you just have a CAB meeting one a week,\nyou build up your changes\n\n531\n00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:47.820\nthrough the week, you submit them all at\nonce, and you try and get them approved.\n\n532\n00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.960\nAnd if the CAB meeting is on Wednesday and\n\n533\n00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.710\nyou come up with a change on Thursday,\nyou gotta wait six days for\n\n534\n00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.170\nthe next Wednesday to roll around for\nthat change to get approved.\n\n535\n00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:02.520\nSo a cab can really be an obstacle for\nreactivity, right?\n\n536\n00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.725\nFor change, for improving your systems,\nit can be bureaucracy and so\n\n537\n00:25:05.725 --> 00:25:07.285\npeople hate it, right.\n\n538\n00:25:07.285 --> 00:25:10.705\nBut what you need to do is you need to\nrecognize that some changes are critical\n\n539\n00:25:10.705 --> 00:25:13.975\nand urgent and most aren't,\nand most can wait a week.\n\n540\n00:25:13.975 --> 00:25:14.815\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n541\n00:25:14.815 --> 00:25:16.975\nYou might wanna do it right now,\nbut you can wait a week.\n\n542\n00:25:16.975 --> 00:25:18.915\nBut there's other ones that are critical.\n\n543\n00:25:18.915 --> 00:25:23.215\nHey, a firewall is about to run out\nof memory at this branch office.\n\n544\n00:25:23.215 --> 00:25:24.595\nI see it, I wanna reboot it.\n\n545\n00:25:24.595 --> 00:25:27.450\nI'm gonna do a change ticket and\nsay I'm gonna reboot it, but\n\n546\n00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:28.740\nI gotta wait six days.\n\n547\n00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.820\nIt's gonna run out of memory in two days.\n\n548\n00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.080\nI'm out of luck.\nI just gotta let that branch go down.\n\n549\n00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.620\nWell no, you can do an emergency ticket.\n\n550\n00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.890\nYou need to have an emergency plan\nthat says, if I've got an emergency,\n\n551\n00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.460\nI don't necessarily have to\nconvene the whole board, but\n\n552\n00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.990\nI can reach out to\nthe members individually.\n\n553\n00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:46.200\nAnd as long as I get three out\nof five signatures, or whatever,\n\n554\n00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.150\na certain portion, I can go ahead and\npush the emergency change through.\n\n555\n00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.100\nBut it's gotta be an emergency change, so\nyou've gotta come up with a policy that\n\n556\n00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.050\ndefines what's an emergency,\nand what's not, right?\n\n557\n00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.290\nIf I know that branch is gonna\nbe down before the next cab,\n\n558\n00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.320\nthat's an emergency, that needs\nto be able to be pushed through.\n\n559\n00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.610\nAnd maybe my policy is really small, and\nI just say the CIO can approve it, and\n\n560\n00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:07.339\nthat's it.\n\n561\n00:26:07.339 --> 00:26:08.476\nBut normally it does a little bit more,\n\n562\n00:26:08.476 --> 00:26:09.784\ncuz you do wanna check\nwith the other people,\n\n563\n00:26:09.784 --> 00:26:11.450\nmake sure that you're not\ngonna impact anything crazy.\n\n564\n00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:14.080\nSo change management, really critical.\n\n565\n00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.400\nJust because you need that\ndocument that says what change, so\n\n566\n00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.370\nyou know what's going\non in your environment.\n\n567\n00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.850\nAnd your configuration management,\nalso important.\n\n568\n00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.233\nSo when you deploy new systems, you've\ngot a consistent way to deploy them.\n\n569\n00:26:25.233 --> 00:26:28.660\nAnd if anybody deviates from that, you'll\nknow about it, you've got it right there.\n\n570\n00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.750\nSo these two go hand in hand and\nthey're really important.\n\n571\n00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:35.440\nIf you're a small company with one IT guy,\nyou can get away with not doing them.\n\n572\n00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.720\nBut if you're a large company, if you've\ngot 30, 40 IT people that are all managing\n\n573\n00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.980\nthe systems,\nyou're stepping on each other's toes,\n\n574\n00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:47.010\nyou're gonna get inconsistency and you're\ngonna get compromised, because different\n\n575\n00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.130\nadmins are configuring systems different\nways and all of a sudden you've got one\n\n576\n00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.910\nsystem that's weaker than another and\nyou get broken into, and that's terrible.\n\n577\n00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.770\nSo you wanna avoid that,\ndis-bureaucracy solves that problem.\n\n578\n00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:59.890\n>> Configuration management and\nchange management,\n\n579\n00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:02.870\nif you're first getting into this it can\nbe confusing, and you know what I've been\n\n580\n00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.460\nstudying a little bit myself and\nit's sometimes still confusing.\n\n581\n00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.060\nSo Don thank you for\nalleviating some of that confusion.\n\n582\n00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.340\nKeep in mind that you need to know this\nstuff for the clown plus exam, but\n\n583\n00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.840\nit's very good information to know,\nif you're not in a certification endeavor.\n\n584\n00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.920\nSo again Don thank you for that.\n\n585\n00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.320\nDo you have anything else for\nus in this episode?\n\n586\n00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:20.960\n>> That's about it.\n\n587\n00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.670\nI mean, you usually are gonna\nleverage third parties software for\n\n588\n00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.270\na lot of this stuff.\n\n589\n00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.087\nThere's plenty of companies out there\nthat make change management systems and\n\n590\n00:27:27.087 --> 00:27:29.199\nusually you just use like their\nsupport ticketing system.\n\n591\n00:27:29.199 --> 00:27:33.650\nBut honestly, Word templates or\ntext files or whatever, they work.\n\n592\n00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.620\nEven simple emails can serve as that.\n\n593\n00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.590\nBut you'll need to set up\na change database somewhere, or\n\n594\n00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.950\na configuration management database,\nso you can keep track of it all.\n\n595\n00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:43.190\nSo definitely look for\nthird-party software that can do that.\n\n596\n00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.970\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n597\n00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.660\nRemember, this has been\na two-part episode,\n\n598\n00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.090\nso if you missed any of the first part,\ngo back and watch it.\n\n599\n00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:52.310\nBut looks like we've come to the end\nof another episode here at ITProTV.\n\n600\n00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.090\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off today.\n\n601\n00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.360\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n602\n00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.280\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n603\n00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.888\n>> And we'll see you

00:00:16.530\nI'm your host Wes Brian and\n\n4\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.400\nin today's episode we're gonna be\nmoving along our Cloud Plus series.\n\n5\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.580\nAnd we're gonna be looking at some\ncomponents today that can either\n\n6\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.270\ndrastically improve the quality of\nthe service that you provide or\n\n7\n00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.540\nthe opposite way, right?\n\n8\n00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.000\nCan really degrade\nthe quality of the service.\n\n9\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.770\nSo, we're gonna be looking at\nsome performance concepts and\n\n10\n00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.130\nhere to show us these concepts is Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.980\nHow you doing, Don?\n\n12\n00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.420\n>> I'm doing great, Wes, and\n\n13\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.890\nyou know just ready to jump back right be\ninto the world of Cloud Plus environment.\n\n14\n00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.720\nAnd if you're looking at the Cloud Plus\nexam objectives, you'll notice that when\n\n15\n00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.780\nwe get to performance,\nthat they really only call out.\n\n16\n00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.050\nWes and\nI were talking about it before the show,\n\n17\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.580\nthey call out network performance and\ndisk performance.\n\n18\n00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.140\nBut we're gonna talk about\nkind of the big four.\n\n19\n00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.680\nOr as Wes call them, the four horsemen,\nright, CPU, RAM, network, disk.\n\n20\n00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.350\nAs we start to deploy our servers,\nespecially in a virtual environment,\n\n21\n00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.940\nwe've gotta keep an eye on this and\nit's performance in the VMs\n\n22\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.930\nas well as performance in the hosts,\nbecause degradation at the host level\n\n23\n00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.940\nis going to affect the VM, and a VM that's\ngoing crazy might affect other VMs.\n\n24\n00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.260\nSo we've gotta be able to watch this\nstuff, keep a handle on it, and\n\n25\n00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.010\nunderstand what these numbers mean.\n\n26\n00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.240\nSo I'm gonna show you some examples that\ntoday, how we deal with performance, and\n\n27\n00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.690\nall the different considerations we\nhave as we go and implement that.\n\n28\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.110\n>> One of the first concepts that we have\nto look at is well, we have data and\n\n29\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.100\nwe have to store it, right?\n\n30\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.055\nAnd we have to retrieve that information,\nand one of the problems is if we can't\n\n31\n00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:37.945\nget to that information fast enough,\nwe can see some quality greatly reduced.\n\n32\n00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:41.345\nSo Don, it looks like the first thing\nwe're gonna jump in here is a little bit\n\n33\n00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:44.395\nof the hard drives or\nthe disks that we have to use, right?\n\n34\n00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:48.035\n>> Absolutely, now we're gonna kick\noff talking about disk and network.\n\n35\n00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:51.185\nAnd I'm gonna kinda skip over CPU and\nRAM, and you might wonder about that.\n\n36\n00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:52.760\nWe will talk about them\na little bit later.\n\n37\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.180\nBut when you deploy a machine,\nusually RAM and CPU,\n\n38\n00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.300\nthose are kind of fixed values, right?\n\n39\n00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.130\nIf I deploy a system and it's got four\nprocessor cores, that's just what it has.\n\n40\n00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.130\nI'm not gonna have less cores.\n\n41\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.030\nI'm not gonna have more cores.\n\n42\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.690\nIt's just what I have.\n\n43\n00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.360\nAnd when I give it RAM,\nif I give it 4 gigs of RAM or\n\n44\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.670\n8 gigs of RAM that's what I have,\nthat's it.\n\n45\n00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.780\nIn a virtual environment,\nthe same way, when you spit up a VM,\n\n46\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.480\nyou pick those things.\n\n47\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.120\nBut network bandwidth,\nyou don't pick that, right?\n\n48\n00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.510\nNetwork bandwidth is virtualized.\n\n49\n00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.530\nIt's virtualized for the guest, and the\nhost has some fixed network bandwidth, and\n\n50\n00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.920\nthat's what we have to worry about.\n\n51\n00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.390\nWell, we have to worry\nabout it if it's our cloud.\n\n52\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.980\nBut if it's a public cloud\nlike Amazon Web Services,\n\n53\n00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.040\nor Microsoft Azure,\nyou don't see the underlying bandwidth.\n\n54\n00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.985\nYou just deploy your machine and\n\n55\n00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:38.600\nit;s got infinite amounts of bandwidth\navailable, not truly infinite.\n\n56\n00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.520\nSame thing goes for disk IO.\n\n57\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.230\nWhen you deploy these disks, you don't\nknow the underlying infrastructure.\n\n58\n00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.370\nYou don't know if it's rated zero,\nrated 5, rated 10, if it's rated at all,\n\n59\n00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.120\nyou don't see that.\n\n60\n00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.960\nYou just see a virtual volume.\n\n61\n00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.000\nAnd so tracking disk performance and\n\n62\n00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.110\ntracking network performance\nare really important.\n\n63\n00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.120\nThat's why we're gonna\nstress those two the most.\n\n64\n00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.090\nIn a virtual environment, disk and\n\n65\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.090\nnetwork are two things that we need\nto track because they're so nebulous.\n\n66\n00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.050\nThey can change so\neasily from what we actually have.\n\n67\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.020\n>> And\nI was going to say too now discs and\n\n68\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.300\nnetworks are going to have\ndifferent metrics you know.\n\n69\n00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.630\nThe metric isn't going to be the same, so\n\n70\n00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.630\nwhen disc's on we've got quite\na few different metrics we need\n\n71\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.010\nto monitor in order to make sure are we\nactually getting the performance we need?\n\n72\n00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.570\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and you know, just\nusing Amazon web service as an example,\n\n73\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.810\nthey track what are called IOPS, right.\n\n74\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.270\nAnd IOPS is pretty common.\n\n75\n00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.800\nMicrosoft tracks them too.\n\n76\n00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.910\nIn your own environment, you may or\n\n77\n00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.400\nmay not track IOPS but IOPS just stands\nfor input output operations per second.\n\n78\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.720\nAnd input/output on a disk you're\nreally talking about reads and writes.\n\n79\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.910\nSo how many reads and how many writes\nare you doing per second on the disk?\n\n80\n00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.670\nWell Amazon when they sell you service\nwhen Microsoft sells you service\n\n81\n00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.840\nthey don't know are you going to be read\nheavy are you going to be write heavy.\n\n82\n00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.870\nWhat's your usage scenario going to be?\n\n83\n00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.140\nAnd it's different.\n\n84\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.660\nWhen you read from a disc the impact is\na lot less than when you write to a disc.\n\n85\n00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.860\nYou see that variation and\ndoes impact things.\n\n86\n00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.450\nSo when we start you to the point\nof service they just try and\n\n87\n00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.120\ngive you a ball park number.\n\n88\n00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.300\nBut they may or\nmay not living up to what it is we want.\n\n89\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.470\nWe my have to take action there.\n\n90\n00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.020\nI think I showed it in another episode\nwhere I deployed a machine like here\n\n91\n00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.210\nI'll take this one so\nif I take a machine like this guy here.\n\n92\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.260\nThis is a Linux machine that\nI've got deployed in AWS.\n\n93\n00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.950\nIf I take a look at its configuration,\nI've attached a volume to it,\n\n94\n00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.590\nit's got a hard drive attached to it,\nit'll be listed in here somewhere.\n\n95\n00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.150\nActually it's probably easier\njust to see it under the volumes.\n\n96\n00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.850\nSo if I go under my volumes,\n\n97\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.900\nhere I've got a couple of hard drives\nthat are applied to the machine.\n\n98\n00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.310\nAnd when I look at these drives I've got\nan 8 Gig drive here that's listed as io1.\n\n99\n00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.340\nAnd another drive that's listed as gp2.\n\n100\n00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.380\nRight, and what are those?\n\n101\n00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.260\nWell there's general purpose drives\nthat don't have io reserve for them.\n\n102\n00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.910\nAnd then there's io1 drives that do\nhave io reserve and looking over here,\n\n103\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.880\nyou'll see where some of mine only\nhave 24 I/O per second, and that's it.\n\n104\n00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.010\nI can do 24 reads and writes per second.\n\n105\n00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.010\nNow, is that big number or\nis that a little number?\n\n106\n00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.030\nIt depends, it's hard to say.\n\n107\n00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.990\nYour software may immediately\nload into RAM and\n\n108\n00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.440\ndo everything from RAM, and you might not\neven be generating any I/O per second.\n\n109\n00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.970\nMost of the time your server's up,\nyou might be at zero.\n\n110\n00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.800\nOr you might have a database that is\nconstantly reaching out to that disk and\n\n111\n00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.810\nreading data and 24 might not be enough.\n\n112\n00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.300\nAnd if I'm succeeding that 24,\nwhat happens?\n\n113\n00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.110\nWell, my database gets slow.\n\n114\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.110\nI start getting slower and\nslower access as a result.\n\n115\n00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.150\nAnd that's a problem, right?\n\n116\n00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.620\nSo, I might need reserved\naccess like this one.\n\n117\n00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.940\nHere I've reserved 240 ios per second.\n\n118\n00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.250\nAnd if I'm constantly exceeding that,\nmy system's gonna get slow, but\n\n119\n00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.060\nif I stay underneath it,\nI get great performance.\n\n120\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.190\nBut if I'm not using it,\nI'm still paying for it.\n\n121\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.890\nIt's up to me to configure\nthe disks to meet that need.\n\n122\n00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.153\nThey ask you when you set up a new VM,\nso for example,\n\n123\n00:05:56.153 --> 00:05:57.504\nlet me go back instances here.\n\n124\n00:05:57.504 --> 00:06:00.722\nIf I spin up an instance,\nwhen I get to the storage page,\n\n125\n00:06:00.722 --> 00:06:02.513\nit's gonna ask me about this.\n\n126\n00:06:02.513 --> 00:06:05.979\nI'm just going to breeze through this\na little on the fast side here and\n\n127\n00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.226\nget to the storage page.\n\n128\n00:06:07.226 --> 00:06:11.153\nAnd when I get to the storage page,\nHere's where it's asking me, all right for\n\n129\n00:06:11.153 --> 00:06:14.010\nthe operating system\npartition what do I want?\n\n130\n00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.040\nWell, we normally don't care about\nthat one cuz the operating system\n\n131\n00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.060\nonly does so much.\n\n132\n00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.020\nBut my data drive,\nwhen I add in my data drive, I can pick.\n\n133\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.110\nDo I want to go general purpose and\n\n134\n00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.660\nhave limited IO or do I want to\nbump that up and do provisioned IO\n\n135\n00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.970\nwhere now I have a specific amount of\nIOs that I'm reserving and I pick.\n\n136\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.930\nThe way Amazon does it,\nif you do general purpose,\n\n137\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.800\nyour IOPS are determined\nby the size of the drives.\n\n138\n00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.050\nSo if I bump it up to 100 Gigs,\nit's the size of the drive times three.\n\n139\n00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.060\nSo I end up with 300 IOPS per second.\n\n140\n00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.590\nIf I bump it up to a terabyte, which I'm\nnot sure if this one will let me do.\n\n141\n00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.420\nIt will.\n\n142\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.980\nThen I get to 3,000 IOPS per second.\n\n143\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.240\nDoesn't matter if I actually\nuse the whole terabyte.\n\n144\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.220\nBut what it's doing is associating\na cost with those I/Os.\n\n145\n00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.930\nYou pay per gigabyte per month.\n\n146\n00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.340\nSo now I'm paying for a terabyte and\n\n147\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.080\nI get 3000 I/Os as a result,\neven if I'm only using a fraction of it.\n\n148\n00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.340\nOr I could go with Provisioned I/Os and\nI could say I just need an 8 gig drive,\n\n149\n00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.640\nI don't need a huge amount of storage,\nbut I want 3000 IOs for\n\n150\n00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.030\nit, and now it's reserved and\nI always get it.\n\n151\n00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.850\nWhen you do general\npurpose you're paying for\n\n152\n00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.610\nwhat you use, when you do provisioned\nIO you're paying for all of it.\n\n153\n00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.440\nI'm paying for all of these\nIOs whether I use them or not.\n\n154\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.940\nSo how do I know if I need to do that?\n\n155\n00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.860\nI don't wanna pay for\nit if I don't need it.\n\n156\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.990\nWe need to be able to monitor it.\n\n157\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.690\nWhatever solution it is you deploy.\n\n158\n00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.190\nIf you do VMware vSphere and it's all\nlocal, you need to monitor performance.\n\n159\n00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.290\nIf you do Microsoft Azure as a hybrid\nwhere some servers are local and\n\n160\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.050\nsome are up in Azure,\nyou need to monitor it.\n\n161\n00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.790\nIf you do 100% in Amazon AWS\nyou need to monitor it.\n\n162\n00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.890\nAll right?\nSo no matter how it is you deploy this,\n\n163\n00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.712\nyou always need to be monitoring it and\nthat's kind of the key principle here.\n\n164\n00:07:53.712 --> 00:07:54.712\nYou need to use something.\n\n165\n00:07:54.712 --> 00:07:57.046\nWell here I'm deployed all in AWS.\n\n166\n00:07:57.046 --> 00:07:59.004\nRight, so how do I monitor that?\n\n167\n00:07:59.004 --> 00:08:00.171\nI can use third party software.\n\n168\n00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:02.537\nI can fire up\nSolarwinds Network Performance Monitor or\n\n169\n00:08:02.537 --> 00:08:03.500\nsomething like that.\n\n170\n00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.526\nBut Amazon is already\nmonitoring this stuff for me,\n\n171\n00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:06.730\ncuz they're billing me on it.\n\n172\n00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.860\nSo that they've got to monitor it and\nthey share that data with us.\n\n173\n00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.490\nSo with them, I can use CloudWatch.\n\n174\n00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.811\nSo if I jump over to CloudWatch,\nlet me just kinda jump over there.\n\n175\n00:08:15.811 --> 00:08:19.330\nIn CloudWatch, we can start to\nsee a lot of these metrics.\n\n176\n00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.620\nAmazon's tracking them anyway,\nthey share them with me.\n\n177\n00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.240\nAnd if I look in here under metrics,\nyou'll see EBS,\n\n178\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.670\nwhich is elastic block store,\nthere's my disk.\n\n179\n00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.840\nAnd EC2, well, that's elastic compute\ncloud, that's my virtual machines.\n\n180\n00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.650\nAnd if I go into EC2,\nI'm gonna see metrics for,\n\n181\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.460\nyou guys saw I only had\none machine running.\n\n182\n00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.230\nI might have more than one here because\nthey track like a month's worth of\n\n183\n00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.520\nmetrics so I even have machines that\nI've deleted will show up in here.\n\n184\n00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.730\nBut I can kind of track down my instance\nand if I hunt it down, I was kind of\n\n185\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.290\nhoping it would show up by name but it's\nnot, but I can come in and try to find it.\n\n186\n00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.540\nAnd I can start to look for\nthe metrics for that machine.\n\n187\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.040\nI've got all my instance ids over here\nthat I can track and start to see those.\n\n188\n00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.290\nSo what I'm looking at right now\nare kinda my per instance metrics.\n\n189\n00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.830\nAnd when you look at these metrics,\n\n190\n00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.930\nthe numbers you're getting over\nhere are pretty important.\n\n191\n00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.620\nWe've got our CPUUtilization.\n\n192\n00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.370\nHow much of the processor am I using?\n\n193\n00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.250\nI might have provisioned this\nmachine with only two CPUs.\n\n194\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.750\nAnd it needs to go to four and use that\nmore, right, if I'm using up all the CPU.\n\n195\n00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.910\nI've got DiskReadOps and DiskWriteOps.\n\n196\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.770\nThose are your IOPs, right.\n\n197\n00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.830\nDiskReadOps, those are the output.\n\n198\n00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.740\nDiskWriteOps, those are the input.\n\n199\n00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.320\nWe're writing data to the drive or\ngetting data out of it.\n\n200\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.140\nAnd I can look at how many operations\nI'm performing per second.\n\n201\n00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.810\nAnd that's where I can track, am I hitting\nmy limit, and do I need to go higher?\n\n202\n00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.930\nBy tracking these we can\neven identify trends.\n\n203\n00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.326\nI can see if I've had an increase over\ntime, and take action based on that.\n\n204\n00:09:45.326 --> 00:09:47.630\nI've got network in and network out.\n\n205\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.700\nThose are good ones for\nseeing what your bandwidth is.\n\n206\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.260\nHow much bandwidth am\nI actually consuming.\n\n207\n00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.060\nNow with Amazon,\nthey don't charge you for NetworkIn, So\n\n208\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.653\nyou can send as much traffic in as you\nwant, they don't charge you for that.\n\n209\n00:09:57.653 --> 00:09:59.250\nThey charge on the way out.\n\n210\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:09:59.800\nBut just for\n\n211\n00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.170\nyour own tracking you might want to see\nhow much data is moving in and out.\n\n212\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.650\nAnd there are several other\nmetrics that are in here.\n\n213\n00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.990\nThere's one metric that's missing though,\non the side of Disk we've got iOps.\n\n214\n00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.460\nOur reads and our rights and we normally\nwant to monitor those operations, but\n\n215\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.370\nyou can monitor them as bytes also.\n\n216\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:20.400\nSo how much does sheer data in\nbytes am I writing or reading.\n\n217\n00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.190\nOps are usually a little more accurate for\n\n218\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.260\nus as far as what's going on,\nbut the bytes are useful.\n\n219\n00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.052\nBut you'll notice that I've got those, but\nI'm kind of missing a little bit of extra.\n\n220\n00:10:31.052 --> 00:10:34.982\nThere's other metric,\nthat I like to monitor that is the queue,\n\n221\n00:10:34.982 --> 00:10:38.950\nwhich is how much stuff is\nwaiting to right to the disk?\n\n222\n00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.720\nIf I see my ops here,\nand I know my limit, and\n\n223\n00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.860\nmy ops match my limit,\nthen I know I'm at my limit.\n\n224\n00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.620\nBut if I don't know the limit,\nif I don't know what its set at,\n\n225\n00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.610\nlooking in these ops not in the silly,\nmeaningful to me.\n\n226\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.480\nAnd so there is another\nmetric which is the disk cue.\n\n227\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.070\nAnd if I jump down the EBS this time,\nand I started looking at my volumes,\n\n228\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.180\nyou'll see the VolumeQueueLength and\nthe VolumeReadOps.\n\n229\n00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.840\nThis is really important.\n\n230\n00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.290\nYou might have more than one\nvolume attached to an instance.\n\n231\n00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.720\nAnd so when I'm looking at the EC2\nmetrics, I'm seeing it for the instance,\n\n232\n00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.100\nwhich is kind of like all the disks\naveraged together, and that's not good.\n\n233\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.450\nHere I can see it based\non the volume itself.\n\n234\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:21.260\nSo if I have one volume with provisioned\nio at 2,000 IOPS per second, I can come in\n\n235\n00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.380\nhere and I can look at the read and\nwrite OPS for it and find that out.\n\n236\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.620\nOr I can just look at the queue length.\n\n237\n00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.557\nThe queue length will be zero all\nthe way up until you hit your limit.\n\n238\n00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:33.880\nAnd as soon as you hit your limit,\nthe queue length will start increasing.\n\n239\n00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.150\nThe queue length is how many people\nare waiting to get to the disk.\n\n240\n00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.220\nAnd you'll only have people\nwait if you hit your limit.\n\n241\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.010\nSo if I only have 24 IOPS,\nand I come in here and\n\n242\n00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.050\nI see my queue length at nine, that means\nI've got nine operations waiting to get to\n\n243\n00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:49.970\nthe disk cuz we're already at 24.\n\n244\n00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:55.050\nAnd I need to bump up to 33 or\nhigher to make sure that I can cover that.\n\n245\n00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.094\nNow it might just be a spike,\na one time thing, and\n\n246\n00:11:57.094 --> 00:11:59.840\nthen I don't really care about it,\nright, if it's just a spike.\n\n247\n00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.430\nBut if I'm routinely hitting that limit,\nthen I've got a problem.\n\n248\n00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.910\nSo when I look at this,\nit's important that I come down here and\n\n249\n00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.290\napparently I've got no data\navailable in this time range.\n\n250\n00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.530\nBut I need to come down here and\nlook at the time ranges.\n\n251\n00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:15.670\nAnd see has it consistently had a queue?\n\n252\n00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.429\nOr has just this been a one time thing\nthat I don't need to worry about?\n\n253\n00:12:18.429 --> 00:12:22.520\nTracking these metrics is\ncritical to see what's going on.\n\n254\n00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.450\nAnd then understand two things.\n\n255\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:29.060\nOne, you may be performing more reads or\nmore writes.\n\n256\n00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.540\nThey way you use this, it's gonna depend.\n\n257\n00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.760\nIt's not gonna be equal, it's very rare\nthat you have equal reads and writes.\n\n258\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.400\nAnd then on top of that\nperformance is different, right.\n\n259\n00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.080\nMost of Amazon storage uses SSD now.\n\n260\n00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.560\nRight, when I provisioned that virtual\nmachine, you might have noticed that\n\n261\n00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.880\none of the options I had was\nprovision magnetic storage.\n\n262\n00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.490\nAnd, we don't normally do magnetic storage\nanymore because it's all gone to SSDs.\n\n263\n00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.870\nAnd so, when I create a volume,\nit asks me do I want General Purpose SSD,\n\n264\n00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.000\nIOPS SSD or Magnetic.\n\n265\n00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.800\nAnd see how Magnetic doesn't, Magnetic\ndoesn't even have IOPS, not applicable.\n\n266\n00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.230\nIt's just first come first served.\n\n267\n00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.500\nIt's the wild west.\n\n268\n00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.490\nYou don't want to go magnetic.\n\n269\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.290\nSo, were always using SSD.\n\n270\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:14.010\nWell on magnetics, they normally read and\nwrite at about the same speed.\n\n271\n00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:19.470\nBut on SSD they don't, and let me\njust show you an example, let's see.\n\n272\n00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.134\nApparently I don't have it open.\n\n273\n00:13:20.134 --> 00:13:23.682\nLet me get my black magic\ndisk speed test set up here.\n\n274\n00:13:23.682 --> 00:13:25.560\nAll right, so I just wanna do\na quick demonstration here and\n\n275\n00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.750\nshow you guys the performance\ncharacteristics of SSD,\n\n276\n00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.930\ncuz it's a little different.\n\n277\n00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.210\nWith Magnetic, usually the reads and\nwrites happen at the same speed.\n\n278\n00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.680\nBut I've got a little external SSD\nattached here to my system and\n\n279\n00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.120\nI'm just gonna run a quick read and\n\n280\n00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.320\nwrite test against it and kinda show you\nguys how that's not always the case.\n\n281\n00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.770\nSo see how I'm writing to this disk at\nabout 230 megabytes per second, right?\n\n282\n00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.180\nThat's my write performance on it.\n\n283\n00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:54.407\nAnd then if I start reading from it,\nI'm reading at 268, 267 MB.\n\n284\n00:13:54.407 --> 00:13:58.810\nSo I'm reading from it at a faster\nspeed than I'm writing to it.\n\n285\n00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.360\nAnd that's very common.\n\n286\n00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.350\nSometimes this can be very different.\n\n287\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:07.300\nI've seen some where you get\n400 MB per second reads, but\n\n288\n00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.720\nonly 250 MB per second writes, you can\nsee some really big differences there.\n\n289\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.570\nSo read and\nwrite IO on an SSD is not equal.\n\n290\n00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.632\nOn a Magnetic, it usually is,\non SSDs, it is not.\n\n291\n00:14:18.632 --> 00:14:20.429\nAnd soo that's why we've gotta track this.\n\n292\n00:14:20.429 --> 00:14:24.431\nAnd that's why Amazon just has this\ngeneric IOPS number that they use,\n\n293\n00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:28.642\nas opposed to saying here's your reads\nthat you get or writes that you get.\n\n294\n00:14:28.642 --> 00:14:30.104\nBecause they know they're\nnot equal anymore.\n\n295\n00:14:30.104 --> 00:14:31.715\nAnd so they just do a generic iOPS,\n\n296\n00:14:31.715 --> 00:14:35.510\nit's basically like a pool of operations\nthat your reads and writes come out of.\n\n297\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.510\nSo that's why those numbers are like that.\n\n298\n00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.865\nBut it's important for us to track that so\nthat we know when it's appropriate to use\n\n299\n00:14:40.865 --> 00:14:44.120\nProvisioned IOPS versus\nusing dedicated ones.\n\n300\n00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.800\nI mean, not dedicated but dynamic ones.\n\n301\n00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.940\nIf you're building your own private cloud,\nobviously you don't have billing to\n\n302\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.200\ntrack for this stuff, but you have to\nhave the right hardware set aside for it.\n\n303\n00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.760\nAnd you don't wanna overload\na set of physical disks on a SAN\n\n304\n00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.380\nby having too many VMs on it all\ndoing contending for the same disks.\n\n305\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.530\nSo we want to make sure that we've got\nenough physical discs to support our VMs.\n\n306\n00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.300\nAnd monitoring those queue lengths is\na great way to see when you've overloaded\n\n307\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.600\nthat system, that adaptor.\n\n308\n00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.320\nThere are other things that we\nneed to worry about in this world,\n\n309\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.070\nthings like meta-data performance.\n\n310\n00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.710\nI know I talked about\nmeta-data in another episode.\n\n311\n00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.630\nIf you have millions and\nmillions of very small files,\n\n312\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.300\nthe metadata can actually be\nlarger than the files themselves.\n\n313\n00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.890\nThe metadata, are like\nthe descriptive blocks of the files.\n\n314\n00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.240\nSo that can happen, especially if\nyou've got a large amount of data.\n\n315\n00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.709\nAnd when that happens,\nquerying directories and\n\n316\n00:15:35.709 --> 00:15:37.950\nsystems like that becomes very, very slow.\n\n317\n00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.622\nYou might have a fast disk, but it's gonna\nread metadata across all those files, and\n\n318\n00:15:41.622 --> 00:15:43.690\nthat really can slow things down.\n\n319\n00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.470\nI get this in like Windows.\n\n320\n00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.440\nIf I have a folder that has\nthousands of pictures in it.\n\n321\n00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.337\nAnd you browse in to it what\ndoes Windows start doing?\n\n322\n00:15:50.337 --> 00:15:52.691\nIt starts generating thumbnails for\nall those photos and\n\n323\n00:15:52.691 --> 00:15:56.087\nyour system starts getting slow while it\ndoes it and it's really super annoying.\n\n324\n00:15:56.087 --> 00:15:57.338\nThat's metadata.\n\n325\n00:15:57.338 --> 00:15:59.699\nSo if you're dealing with\nlarge quantities of files,\n\n326\n00:15:59.699 --> 00:16:01.712\nthere's cloud services\nthat can solve this.\n\n327\n00:16:01.712 --> 00:16:04.660\nSo for example, Amazon's S3, right?\n\n328\n00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.680\nThey're a simple storage solution.\n\n329\n00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.610\nWhen you do S3, it actually\nsupports tracking the metadata and\n\n330\n00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.650\nwhat it's doing is it's\ndoing it in a database.\n\n331\n00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:16.850\nWhen you browse into S3,\nit looks like you've got files in folders.\n\n332\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:22.090\nBut what you really have are just\ndatabase tables, and in that database,\n\n333\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.910\nthere's files that are really just binary\ndata stored as blobs in the database.\n\n334\n00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.850\nAnd that way, the metadata can be queried\nand retrieved and indexed into RAM and\n\n335\n00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.830\ndone much, much more quickly.\n\n336\n00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.930\nThere's also third party systems like\nAPC and Mem cache D and in those guys\n\n337\n00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.590\nthat can perform caching operations too to\nspeed up that access and those lookups.\n\n338\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.140\nBut just be aware that you may need to\ncache things in order to get that optimal\n\n339\n00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.410\nstorage performance.\n\n340\n00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.960\n>> All right, Don,\n\n341\n00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.800\nI'm gonna throw another acronym at\nyou that I've kind of heard before.\n\n342\n00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.780\nThe CDNs.\n\n343\n00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.829\nWhen it comes to our data,\nwhere do the CDNs come into place for us?\n\n344\n00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:56.537\n>> All right, so CDN,\nContent Delivery Networks.\n\n345\n00:16:56.537 --> 00:16:58.479\nAnd if you've got a large set of data,\n\n346\n00:16:58.479 --> 00:17:01.954\nit may be that people are frequently\naccessing the exact same data.\n\n347\n00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:03.995\nAnd if the data is static,\nif it doesn't change,\n\n348\n00:17:03.995 --> 00:17:07.103\nwhat you can do is you can use a CDN, and\nthey'll take a copy of your data, and\n\n349\n00:17:07.103 --> 00:17:09.460\nthey'll replicate it to data\ncenters around the world.\n\n350\n00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.528\nAnd that way,\nwhen people go to access your data,\n\n351\n00:17:11.528 --> 00:17:13.646\nthey're getting it from\nmore than one server, and\n\n352\n00:17:13.646 --> 00:17:16.371\npreferably from a server that's\ngeographically close to them.\n\n353\n00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:18.412\nSo they can get quick, speedy access.\n\n354\n00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:21.380\nWith Amazon they have a service\ncalled CloudFront that does that.\n\n355\n00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.960\nIt's great for static data, but if you\nhave data that changes a lot that really\n\n356\n00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.810\ncreates a problem, because it changes,\nand now you got to wait for\n\n357\n00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.330\nit to replicate out everywhere else and\nyou end up with a mess.\n\n358\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.014\nSo with things like virtual machine hard\ndrives, you're not gonna use CDNs for\n\n359\n00:17:33.014 --> 00:17:33.620\nthat, right?\n\n360\n00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.700\nBut if you've got a web server and\nyou have a company logo on it,\n\n361\n00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.230\nyou can use a CDN for that, and you can\ndistribute that load across your systems.\n\n362\n00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.190\nIt's basically like load balancing\nin a way except it's geographically\n\n363\n00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:45.170\ntuned for that.\n\n364\n00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.690\nIt's getting it close to people.\n\n365\n00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.170\nWhich from a similar note,\nwe've got networking, right?\n\n366\n00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.220\nAnd on networking we've got our\nperformance sides there, and\n\n367\n00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.200\nyou've got technologies that\ncan kind of load balance and\n\n368\n00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.130\nbalance our traffic over there too.\n\n369\n00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.970\nSo let's talk a little\nbit about networking.\n\n370\n00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.830\nI went into CloudWatch here to\nshow you some performance and\n\n371\n00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.710\nI showed you where we had\nnetwork metrics in there.\n\n372\n00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.340\nLet me get back to that screen.\n\n373\n00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:10.740\nIf I jump back into CloudWatch and\nI take my ez2 metrics,\n\n374\n00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.620\nsome of the metrics that i saw\nin there in addition to CPU,\n\n375\n00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.690\nand disk, is network in and\nnetwork out, right?\n\n376\n00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.010\nBandwidth, how much stuff we're moving.\n\n377\n00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.830\nAnd in your system you may\nsee one of two metrics.\n\n378\n00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.540\nYou may see bandwidth and\nyou may see throughput, right, and\n\n379\n00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.500\nthey are actually different.\n\n380\n00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.880\nA lot of people use the terms\ninterchangeably and they're not.\n\n381\n00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.780\nBandwidth is typically how many bytes,\nor maybe bits, but\n\n382\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.600\nbytes usually, that you're moving in and\nout of the network.\n\n383\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.290\nSo if I had a 100 megabit connection\nI can move 100 megabits per second.\n\n384\n00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:44.110\nIf I have a gigabit connection,\nI can move 1,000 megabits per second, and\n\n385\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.730\nthat's how much I have\nas far as bandwidth.\n\n386\n00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.300\nAnd so what's my bandwidth utilization?\n\n387\n00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.020\nHow much am I moving?\n\n388\n00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.454\nBut throughput is equally important.\n\n389\n00:18:51.454 --> 00:18:54.053\nThroughput doesn't care\nabout the size of the data,\n\n390\n00:18:54.053 --> 00:18:56.954\nit's how many packets per\nsecond you're moving, right?\n\n391\n00:18:56.954 --> 00:18:58.218\nAnd your packets may be large,\n\n392\n00:18:58.218 --> 00:19:00.950\nthey might be small, but\nhow many are moving per second?\n\n393\n00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:04.940\nAnd this is usually more important,\nbecause every packet has a CRC.\n\n394\n00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.620\nIt has a cyclical redundancy check on it,\na little digital signature.\n\n395\n00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.170\nAnd when the other side receives that\npacket, it's gotta run a mathematical\n\n396\n00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.960\nalgorithm on it to process that CRC and\nsee if the package is damaged.\n\n397\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.570\nIf the packet's damaged,\nwe gotta get another copy of it.\n\n398\n00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.000\nBut if it's okay,\nthen we can process it and run with it.\n\n399\n00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.910\nThat takes power.\n\n400\n00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:22.890\nThat takes networking power.\n\n401\n00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.121\nNetworking resources.\n\n402\n00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:28.478\nAnd so you'll find that if you\nhave a gigabyte network adaptor,\n\n403\n00:19:28.478 --> 00:19:31.865\nin theory,\nit's got the hardware on it to process\n\n404\n00:19:31.865 --> 00:19:35.996\nenough packets per second to\nequal out a gigabit of traffic.\n\n405\n00:19:35.996 --> 00:19:39.682\nBut there's certain technologies that we\ncan use that can make it where you've\n\n406\n00:19:39.682 --> 00:19:41.717\ngot a huge amount of very small packets,\nand\n\n407\n00:19:41.717 --> 00:19:44.410\nyou can exceed the power\nof your network adaptor.\n\n408\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.820\nSo if you've got the option to track\npackets per second, you probably need to\n\n409\n00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.130\ndo that too or throughput,\nthat's important on your own equipment.\n\n410\n00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.180\nIn Amazon land,\nthey take care of that for us,\n\n411\n00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.490\nthat's why I don't have metrics for it.\n\n412\n00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.750\nBut you may see those, they are important.\n\n413\n00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.410\nSo as we start to provision things,\n\n414\n00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.798\nwe might find where we can't keep\nup with the packets per second.\n\n415\n00:20:00.798 --> 00:20:03.510\nAnd then we've gotta find other options,\nright?\n\n416\n00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.372\nSo what are the other\noptions that are out there?\n\n417\n00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:07.621\nWell, NIC bonding is one.\n\n418\n00:20:07.621 --> 00:20:09.420\nI might have more that\none network adapter.\n\n419\n00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.020\nAnd I bond them together, and\nthat way if one's getting overloaded,\n\n420\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.820\nthe others can take up the slack,\nand kind of take that over.\n\n421\n00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.880\nYou'll hear it referred to as\nNIC teaming or NIC bonding.\n\n422\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.990\nNIC is just network interface card.\n\n423\n00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.260\nAnd we can take more than one and\ngroup them together, and\n\n424\n00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.900\nthey can start to share the load, right?\n\n425\n00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.250\nOn storage networks, there's actually\na few different technologies there.\n\n426\n00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.162\nI know we talked about\nSANs in another episode.\n\n427\n00:20:31.162 --> 00:20:35.556\nIn a storage area network, you can\nactually set up whats called MPIO or\n\n428\n00:20:35.556 --> 00:20:37.204\nmulti path input output.\n\n429\n00:20:37.204 --> 00:20:40.950\nAnd this is where you have more than\none way to get to a destination.\n\n430\n00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.180\nSo, in this example, I've got two SANs.\n\n431\n00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.680\nAnd the two SANs are connected\nto two switches, fiber switches.\n\n432\n00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.750\nAnd every server has two HBAs,\n\n433\n00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.450\ntwo host bus adapters,\nthat are connecting to those switches.\n\n434\n00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:58.140\nAnd what that results in is more than\none path to get to a destination.\n\n435\n00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.730\nSo, for example, if Node 1 needs\nto get to this hard drive up here.\n\n436\n00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:08.371\nIt's got one HBA that runs to one switch\nthat runs to one port on the SAN.\n\n437\n00:21:08.371 --> 00:21:11.956\nAnd it's got another HBA that\nruns to another switch that\n\n438\n00:21:11.956 --> 00:21:14.510\nruns to another port on the SAN.\n\n439\n00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:19.350\nTwo completely separate paths\nto get to that storage.\n\n440\n00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.540\nAnd if we're using MPIO we can\nactually load balance, and\n\n441\n00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.460\nnow I get double the bandwidth\nbetween me and that storage.\n\n442\n00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.260\nAnd I get redundancy, if one link fails,\nI can jump over to the other one.\n\n443\n00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.920\nThis ability that more than one path, and\nnot just active standby, but have them\n\n444\n00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:39.770\nboth active, is what M.P.I.O. does and it\nreally creates that performance benefit.\n\n445\n00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.550\nSo this is one technology\nthat we've got available.\n\n446\n00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.520\nThe other thing is on a storage network,\nif you're doing ISCSI,\n\n447\n00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.420\nremember those CRc's that I mentioned?\n\n448\n00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.360\nThose redundancy checks?\n\n449\n00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:54.872\nWell, [CROSSTALK] just making\nsure I've got that right.\n\n450\n00:21:54.872 --> 00:21:57.240\nThose checks, it's a mathematic algorithm,\nit has to run.\n\n451\n00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.780\nThat creates processing power.\n\n452\n00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:03.280\nIf you're on a storage network, you can\nactually increase the size of your frames,\n\n453\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.700\nso that you have less of those checks.\n\n454\n00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:10.240\nA normal frame sent on a network,\nis sent out at 1,500 bytes.\n\n455\n00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.120\nLet me get into like a Cisco switch,\nand I'll show you what I mean.\n\n456\n00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.260\nSo I'm gonna bring up a Cisco switch here,\nand on a Cisco switch, and\n\n457\n00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:24.840\nreally most switches, the default\nframe size is 1500 bytes, right?\n\n458\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.710\nSo let me get connected into a switch.\n\n459\n00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.560\nAnd I'll just show you on this one,\nthis is a production switch, so\n\n460\n00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.090\nI don't wanna mess with it too much.\n\n461\n00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:37.850\nBut if I do a show system mtu,\nMTU is maximum transmission unit.\n\n462\n00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:43.140\nSo when we send a frame out, right now\nmy maximum MTU Is 1500 bytes, right?\n\n463\n00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.560\nThat's the size fo the empty used that\nI'm gonna send out and that's it, okay?\n\n464\n00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.000\nIf I'm sending anything\nbigger than 1500 bytes,\n\n465\n00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.410\nI've gotta break it up into more\nthan one frame which means more than\n\n466\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:57.530\ncyclical redundancy check,\nmore than one CRC, right?\n\n467\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:02.926\nBut if I could make this bigger,\nthen I'd have less CRCs.\n\n468\n00:23:02.926 --> 00:23:05.240\nAnd so there's a technology\ncalled Jumbo Frames, and\n\n469\n00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:10.030\nJumbo Frames lets us combine\nframes together to have less CRCs.\n\n470\n00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.680\nAnd Jumbo Frame normally uses 9,000 bytes.\n\n471\n00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.250\n9,000 bytes.\n\n472\n00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:17.455\nIn other words, you take six frames and\ncombine them together.\n\n473\n00:23:17.455 --> 00:23:22.316\nSo, whereas, we used to have a CRC for\nevery 1,500 bytes,\n\n474\n00:23:22.316 --> 00:23:25.746\nnow we have one CRC for every 9000 bytes.\n\n475\n00:23:25.746 --> 00:23:30.953\nIt's a reduction of, I don't know you\nend up with 17% of or 16% of the CRC's\n\n476\n00:23:30.953 --> 00:23:35.871\nthat you used to have before, and\nthat really improves performance, okay?\n\n477\n00:23:35.871 --> 00:23:38.281\nNow it's not something\nyou wanna set globally so\n\n478\n00:23:38.281 --> 00:23:40.500\nI wouldn't wanna come in here and say.\n\n479\n00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.380\nI mean, I could, but\nyou wouldn't want to say system mtu and\n\n480\n00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.640\nchange it globally here, right?\n\n481\n00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.191\nAnd the reason is, if you wanna use\nJumbo Frames your SAN has to support it,\n\n482\n00:23:50.191 --> 00:23:54.754\nyour switch has to support it, and\nyour network adapter has to support it.\n\n483\n00:23:54.754 --> 00:23:58.380\nEverything in that path has\nto support Jumbo Frames.\n\n484\n00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:03.134\nSo notice here on my system mtu Cisco\nwon't even let me set it above 1552,\n\n485\n00:24:03.134 --> 00:24:08.272\nright, because they know that most of my\nstuff isn't gonna support jumbo frames.\n\n486\n00:24:08.272 --> 00:24:10.520\nBut I could create a storage VLAN.\n\n487\n00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.552\nSo, maybe I do a vlan 900 and\nI give it a name of STORAGE, right,\n\n488\n00:24:14.552 --> 00:24:16.210\nso this is my storage VLAN.\n\n489\n00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:20.714\nAnd in that VLAN, I could come in and\n\n490\n00:24:20.714 --> 00:24:25.940\nsay mtu 9000, and\nnow I support jumbo frames.\n\n491\n00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.810\nNow I'm able to move\na frame as big as 9000.\n\n492\n00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.860\nThe switch will do it if\nsomebody sends it, and\n\n493\n00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.730\nI can just go to the SAN on the client and\nconfigure that so they can send it.\n\n494\n00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.370\n>> I'm gonna play devil's advocate here,\nDon, on you.\n\n495\n00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:40.130\nSo I have less CRCs that I need to check,\nimproves the processing power,\n\n496\n00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:44.790\ncan speed up information being forwarded\nacross that switch's interface.\n\n497\n00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:49.120\nWhat happens, it almost seems like that\nif I do have a CRC that doesn't match,\n\n498\n00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.970\nyou have to re-send a lot\nmore information too.\n\n499\n00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.250\nDoes that come into play at all?\n\n500\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.320\n>> That's true, right?\n\n501\n00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.400\nBut if we're talking about a storage\nnetwork, this is a small network, you've\n\n502\n00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.200\nnormally only got one or two switches\nwith connections that aren't moving.\n\n503\n00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.330\nYou're far less likely to\nhave any interference or\n\n504\n00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.120\nfailed stuff than you\nwould on a normal network.\n\n505\n00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.192\nNormally people have laptops and\ndesktops and cables that are beaten up and\n\n506\n00:25:09.192 --> 00:25:10.169\njostled around.\n\n507\n00:25:10.169 --> 00:25:13.420\nYou have collisions on high traffic\nnetwork, that kind of stuff.\n\n508\n00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.040\nThat happens on a data network.\n\n509\n00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.520\nBut on a storage network where you have\nhosts that are just talking to a SAN,\n\n510\n00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.280\nunless you're exceeding\nyour available capacity,\n\n511\n00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.770\nyou're not gonna have that interference.\n\n512\n00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.200\nThings are gonna be much more reliable and\nthat's why you can make that trade-off.\n\n513\n00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.870\nAnd you can say, yeah, let's do less CRCs,\nknowing that I'd have to retransmit more\n\n514\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:34.030\ndata if there was a failure, but knowing\nthat there's gonna be less failures.\n\n515\n00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.750\nAnd so you get that benefit and\nthings really work out.\n\n516\n00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.550\n>> Very good.\n>> Now I would need to go to my SAN and\n\n517\n00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.450\nturn this on and\nI would need to do it on my servers too.\n\n518\n00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:44.178\nSo for example here, let me take a,\nI got a Windows box parked back here.\n\n519\n00:25:44.178 --> 00:25:46.554\nSo I'm gonna take this Windows machine,\nand\n\n520\n00:25:46.554 --> 00:25:49.253\nif I jump into its network configuration,\nright.\n\n521\n00:25:49.253 --> 00:25:55.877\nSo I'm gonna go into my adapter settings,\nand I'll pull up my Intel 82574L adapter.\n\n522\n00:25:55.877 --> 00:25:56.753\nI don't know if that's good or\nnot, probably not.\n\n523\n00:25:56.753 --> 00:25:59.260\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nconfigure the adapter.\n\n524\n00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.640\nAnd when I go into its advanced settings,\nsomewhere in here,\n\n525\n00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.120\nhere it is, Jumbo Packet.\n\n526\n00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.980\nIt supports jumbo frames, and\nit's disabled by default.\n\n527\n00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.100\nSo I'm not gonna do it,\n\n528\n00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.740\nI'm only gonna send frames that\nare 1500 bytes and that's it.\n\n529\n00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.395\nUnless I come in here, and set it.\n\n530\n00:26:16.395 --> 00:26:19.845\nNow it's doing 9014 Bytes, it's a little\nbit bigger, so I need to account for that.\n\n531\n00:26:19.845 --> 00:26:21.255\nI'm not sure why Microsoft does that.\n\n532\n00:26:21.255 --> 00:26:26.505\nBut basically, I can set it here and\nnow I can send frames up to 9014 bytes.\n\n533\n00:26:26.505 --> 00:26:29.325\nAnd now we can start to push\nbigger data with less CRCs.\n\n534\n00:26:29.325 --> 00:26:31.525\nIf I do the same thing on my SAN, my SAN,\n\n535\n00:26:31.525 --> 00:26:34.161\nmy switch, and\nthe server are all doing it.\n\n536\n00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:37.940\n>> Now that 9014,\nI'm just gonna take a wild guess.\n\n537\n00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:41.790\nThat wouldn't have anything to do with\nthe 802.1Q tagging information, would it?\n\n538\n00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.050\n>> Probably, usually your server\ndoesn't get involved in that.\n\n539\n00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.294\nBut if you're doing virtualization, we\nsaw that in an episode earlier, you can.\n\n540\n00:26:46.294 --> 00:26:46.919\n>> Sure, Absolutely.\n\n541\n00:26:46.919 --> 00:26:48.586\n>> And so\nwe need a lecture room with the tag.\n\n542\n00:26:48.586 --> 00:26:51.176\n14 bytes sounds about right for doing,\n\n543\n00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:54.586\nVLAN numbers are usually\nlike 1 through 4,096.\n\n544\n00:26:54.586 --> 00:26:57.391\nAnd then you got the Spanning Tree\nidentifier that goes in there,\n\n545\n00:26:57.391 --> 00:27:00.820\nso 14 bytes sounds about right for that,\nbut I'd have to look it up to be sure.\n\n546\n00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.760\n>> The name of your adapter\nthere reminded me of the user\n\n547\n00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.245\nname of the kid in Transformers there.\n\n548\n00:27:06.245 --> 00:27:08.419\n[LAUGH] That crazy string of character.\n\n549\n00:27:08.419 --> 00:27:09.961\n>> Who was the kid?\n[LAUGH] >> Sam Witwicky.\n\n550\n00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:11.289\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's a dumb name,\n\n551\n00:27:11.289 --> 00:27:12.127\nall right, so [LAUGH].\n\n552\n00:27:12.127 --> 00:27:13.111\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n553\n00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:14.626\nthose are some considerations.\n\n554\n00:27:14.626 --> 00:27:17.950\nThere's other things too,\nright, like quality of service.\n\n555\n00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.020\nOn a network, we might want to give\nmore priority to one host over another.\n\n556\n00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:24.040\nSo we need a quality of service to\nstart restricting that access to one or\n\n557\n00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.410\ngranting reserved access to another.\n\n558\n00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.990\nDefinitely something\nthat you can implement.\n\n559\n00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:32.440\nLoad balancing, I kind of already\ntalked about NIC teaming a little bit.\n\n560\n00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.020\nBut load balancing in general, I might\nbring up, instead of one server I might\n\n561\n00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.300\nhave five servers and\ndistribute the load across them.\n\n562\n00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.580\nSo instead of one server needing a high\namount of bandwidth, now I've got\n\n563\n00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.940\nfive servers all receiving 20% of the\nbandwidth, and so they'd divide that out.\n\n564\n00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.962\nThose are technologies that we can\nimplement to improve performance also.\n\n565\n00:27:48.962 --> 00:27:52.544\nBut we need to know when to\nimprove that performance.\n\n566\n00:27:52.544 --> 00:27:54.022\nAnd watching your performance metrics,\n\n567\n00:27:54.022 --> 00:27:55.910\nthat's what's gonna be\nthe secret right there.\n\n568\n00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.720\nKeeping an eye on network in,\nnetwork out, disk in,\n\n569\n00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.210\ndisk out, CPU utilization,\nRAM utilization.\n\n570\n00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.140\nThose are all the indicators.\n\n571\n00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.200\nAnd on networking,\n\n572\n00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.770\nI've talked about several technologies\nthat can fix problems there.\n\n573\n00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.850\nOn disk,\nwe know a few technologies there too.\n\n574\n00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:16.100\nOn CPU and RAM, the secret sauce\nthere is just to add more, right.\n\n575\n00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:21.240\nAnd so you've really got two ways to do\nthat, scaling up and scaling out, right?\n\n576\n00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.140\nScaling up is where I say okay,\n\n577\n00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.250\nthis system is running out of CPU or\nrunning out of RAM, I'll just add more.\n\n578\n00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.970\nLet me show you with that Amazon system\nthat got sitting back here somewhere,\n\n579\n00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:32.270\nwhere is that thing?\n\n580\n00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.862\nSo I've got my AWS instance kind of\nparked back here in the background.\n\n581\n00:28:35.862 --> 00:28:38.930\nAnd let's say this system,\nI just see high CPU utilization or\n\n582\n00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.230\nI see it's running out of RAM, okay?\n\n583\n00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:44.810\nWell, what I can do is I can take and\nI can shut it down.\n\n584\n00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:46.920\nAnd so I'll just stop that instance.\n\n585\n00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.400\nAnd once I shut it down, I can add\nmore processors, I can add more RAM,\n\n586\n00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.940\nI can change the instance type.\n\n587\n00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.760\nWith a virtual machine it's\neasy to modify those settings.\n\n588\n00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.230\nActually, do I have, here, VMware.\n\n589\n00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.220\nI'll take one of my servers here,\n\n590\n00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.580\nI'll take one that's off, cuz you\ncan't change them while they're on.\n\n591\n00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.940\nJust like a real server,\nyou can't add more CPUs while it's on.\n\n592\n00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.550\nBut I can come in here\nunder Processors and\n\n593\n00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:12.030\nMemory, and\nI can just give it more cores, right.\n\n594\n00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:16.400\nI can give it more RAM, I can dynamically\nadjust the sliders if I need it.\n\n595\n00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.990\nOn my physical host I can't do that.\n\n596\n00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.450\nOn my physical host I'd\nhave to buy more RAM.\n\n597\n00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.390\nI'd have to buy more processors or\nreplace the server.\n\n598\n00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:24.740\nBut on a virtual machine,\n\n599\n00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.470\nassuming we have the capacity,\nwe can just dynamically add it.\n\n600\n00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.510\nAnd so\nhere in AWS I can choose the instance.\n\n601\n00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:34.160\nGo to Actions > Instance Settings, and\n\n602\n00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.840\nthen right in here I can\nchange the Instance Type.\n\n603\n00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:41.620\nAnd when I do that, here I can pick, and\neach one of these either increases or\n\n604\n00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.570\ndecreases the amount of CPUs and\nthe amount of RAM that it has\n\n605\n00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:48.250\nto give me the performance\ncharacteristics that I want.\n\n606\n00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:50.290\nAnd so I can bump that up or\nbump it down, right?\n\n607\n00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.660\nMaybe I take it down to a t2micro,\nright, and apply that.\n\n608\n00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.830\nAnd now I'm going down to one CPU and\ndown to 1 gig of a RAM or whatever,\n\n609\n00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.710\nI'm making that resource\nfootprint smaller, all right.\n\n610\n00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.880\nYou can do that while your system\nis just right here shut down,\n\n611\n00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.880\nand you start it back up and it's done.\n\n612\n00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.025\nNow you've got your new\ncharacteristics in place.\n\n613\n00:30:10.025 --> 00:30:12.335\n>> Very good, so\na lot of good information on that one.\n\n614\n00:30:12.335 --> 00:30:17.461\nNow, there is another type of scaling we\nhave to worry about for the exam as well.\n\n615\n00:30:17.461 --> 00:30:20.201\nAnd this one, I can tell you,\nI'm not really that familiar with, so\n\n616\n00:30:20.201 --> 00:30:21.627\nwhat would that one be about, Don?\n\n617\n00:30:21.627 --> 00:30:26.525\n>> All right, I talked about,\nI call them scaling up and scaling out.\n\n618\n00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:30.020\nScaling up is when we just add more\nhardware to the system we've got.\n\n619\n00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.040\nAnd eventually you hit a limit,\nyou can't add any more hardware.\n\n620\n00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.078\nI can't fit any more CPUs or I can't\nfit any more RAM on that motherboard,\n\n621\n00:30:35.078 --> 00:30:36.500\nI reached the limit of scaling up.\n\n622\n00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.640\nAnd then you got scaling out,\nwhich is I just add more servers.\n\n623\n00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.220\nI've got one web server, it's busy,\nlet me add a second one.\n\n624\n00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.000\nIt gets busy, I add a third and a fourth,\nand you can do that as far as you want,\n\n625\n00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.090\nyou can scale out really big.\n\n626\n00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.820\nCompTIA calls those scaling\nhorizontally and scaling vertically.\n\n627\n00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.760\nSo scaling vertically, that's scaling up,\nthat's adding hardware.\n\n628\n00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.380\nScaling horizontally,\nthat's scaling out, adding more servers.\n\n629\n00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.250\nBut they call out scaling diagonally.\n\n630\n00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.540\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n631\n00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:05.600\nScaling diagonally is where we add\nhardware and servers at the same time.\n\n632\n00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:10.460\nMaybe I've got a t2.micro with one CPU and\n1 gig of RAM.\n\n633\n00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:16.090\nAnd I bump it up to a t2.medium\nwith two CPUs and 4 gigs of RAM.\n\n634\n00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:19.310\nAnd at the same time, add another\nserver that's configured the same way.\n\n635\n00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:22.360\nSo I'm adding more servers and\nmore hardware at the same time,\n\n636\n00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.585\nI'm scaling diagonally, right?\n\n637\n00:31:24.585 --> 00:31:28.170\nThat's not as common, it's pretty rare and\nmost people don't even acknowledge it.\n\n638\n00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.794\nBut it's on the exam objectives so\nyou need to know it.\n\n639\n00:31:29.794 --> 00:31:32.642\nBut most of the time we're\nscaling vertically, or up, or\n\n640\n00:31:32.642 --> 00:31:34.280\nscaling horizontally, or out.\n\n641\n00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.280\nRight, those are the two main ones.\n\n642\n00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.470\nScaling diagonally is when\nyou do both at the same time.\n\n643\n00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:39.720\n>> Very good now, guys,\n\n644\n00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.100\nwe've talked about a lot of good\ninformation that's gonna ultimately effect\n\n645\n00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.590\nthe service that you provide, or\nthe services that are provided for you.\n\n646\n00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.582\nSo definitely pay attention\nto things like disks,\n\n647\n00:31:48.582 --> 00:31:50.120\npay attention to things like network.\n\n648\n00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.310\nAnd like Don mentioned, even though we\nhaven't gone into too much depth on them,\n\n649\n00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.678\nCPU is obviously gonna come into play for\nus and\n\n650\n00:31:56.678 --> 00:31:59.520\nwe're gonna have to pay\nattention to the memory.\n\n651\n00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.169\nSo, thanks to Don for\nall of that information.\n\n652\n00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:03.200\nYou got anything else for us on this one?\n\n653\n00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.379\nThat's about it,\nI know I used AWS for most of this,\n\n654\n00:32:05.379 --> 00:32:07.127\nin your environment it may be different.\n\n655\n00:32:07.127 --> 00:32:10.702\nBut VMware V-Sphere, Microsoft's Hyper-V,\nthey've all got methods for\n\n656\n00:32:10.702 --> 00:32:14.290\nmonitoring performance, and the metrics\nare usually named the same things.\n\n657\n00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:16.000\nYou might need to check your\nvendor documentation though,\n\n658\n00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.950\nsometimes they change\nthe names of the stuff.\n\n659\n00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.750\nBut what you're monitoring\nreally is the same,\n\n660\n00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.450\nit's the same across all the boards\neven though it has a different name.\n\n661\n00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.980\nWell thanks for that, Don, and\nthank you guys out there for watching.\n\n662\n00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.550\nSo it looks like we come to the end\nof another episode here on ITProTV.\n\n663\n00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:30.400\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this one.\n\n664\n00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.590\nI've been your host West Bryan.\n\n665\n00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:32.480\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n666\n00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.794\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n667\n00:32:35.794 --> 00:32:42.530\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.202\nI'm your host, Wes Bryant.\n\n4\n00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:20.701\nAnd in today's episode, we're going to be\nmoving along in our Cloud Plus series.\n\n5\n00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:24.220\nAnd today, we're going to be looking\nat topics that relate to performance.\n\n6\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.700\nIn past episodes, we talked about\nthe concepts behind performance, but\n\n7\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.470\nwe really didn't show you\nhow do we implement that.\n\n8\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.097\nSo that's what we're going to be looking\nat today, performance optimization,\n\n9\n00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:36.650\nand we have have none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet here to help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.850\nDon, how you doing today, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.750\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.240\nGlad to be back on the show and ready to\njump in into the world of performance.\n\n13\n00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.392\nNow like Wes said, in the last\nepisode it was really conceptual.\n\n14\n00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:47.630\nWe were talking about\nthese touchy-feely ideas,\n\n15\n00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.030\nyou should have good performance,\nyou shouldn't have bad performance, and\n\n16\n00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.840\nthat kind of stuff goes without saying,\nbut it was important to cover.\n\n17\n00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.500\nIt was important that we\nknew the terminology, and\n\n18\n00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.250\nwe knew those concepts around just\nperformance in general on our systems.\n\n19\n00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.575\nBut in this episode, and then we'll\nprobably have more than one part,\n\n20\n00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:06.020\nbecause it's a lot of material to cover,\nwhat we're going to do\n\n21\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.610\nis we're going to take a look at how\nwe actually apply that to a system and\n\n22\n00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.990\nsee some of the different solutions.\n\n23\n00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.220\nSo we're going to optimize, remediate.\n\n24\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.639\nWe're going to look at some issues,\nsee what we can do to correct them and\n\n25\n00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:19.849\nimprove the performance of our systems,\nand do it in a hands on way.\n\n26\n00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:24.888\n>> One of the things that we have to do\nin any type of performance optimization,\n\n27\n00:01:24.888 --> 00:01:27.740\nwe need to know where\ndo we stand right now.\n\n28\n00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.400\nWe don't know if we have to optimize\nanything if we don't know where we're\n\n29\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.230\nat right now.\n\n30\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.180\nAnd Don, we've got some techniques\nthat we have to implement in order to\n\n31\n00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.190\nfigure out where are we.\n\n32\n00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.100\n>> Absolutely, and\nwe've touched on it very,\n\n33\n00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.180\nvery briefly in an earlier episode\nwhere I talked about baselines.\n\n34\n00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.830\nWhat the heck is a baseline?\n\n35\n00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.380\nWell it's basically a snapshot,\n\n36\n00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.170\na report, that shows how your systems\nperform under normal work loads.\n\n37\n00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.700\nAnd the important keyword there is normal.\n\n38\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.840\nWe need to know what our system is\nlike when things are running well, so\n\n39\n00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.640\nthat when things are running bad,\nwe can recognize it.\n\n40\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.600\nThe example I give, you're just not\neven thinking of virtualization.\n\n41\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.653\nYou go and buy a new laptop.\n\n42\n00:02:02.653 --> 00:02:05.920\nThe first day you get it,\nyou're like, man this laptop is fast.\n\n43\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.590\nI love it.\nIt's great.\n\n44\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.510\nBut then two years from now, you're\nsaying, I hate my laptop its so slow.\n\n45\n00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.340\nWell, is it any slower then\nwhen you first got it?\n\n46\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.380\nMaybe.\nIt's hard to say, right?\n\n47\n00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.660\nWe don't necessarily have hard numbers.\n\n48\n00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.820\nWe have this emotional feeling.\n\n49\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.220\nWell I've had the laptop two years now.\n\n50\n00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.990\nI've seen other people's\nlaptops that are faster,\n\n51\n00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.260\nand that makes me feel\nlike mine is slower.\n\n52\n00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.890\nBut what if you had hard numbers?\n\n53\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.970\nLike, hey, here's my disk read and\ndisk write speeds.\n\n54\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.210\nHere's my memory IOD.\n\n55\n00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.460\nHere's my CPU utilization.\n\n56\n00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.540\nHere's what it was like two years ago.\n\n57\n00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.940\nWhat's it like now?\n\n58\n00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.770\nAnd you can compare the hard numbers,\nand you can know for a fact.\n\n59\n00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.570\nYou can look at it and say,\n\n60\n00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.910\nyou know what, it's actually running at\nthe exact same speed it did two years ago.\n\n61\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.980\nI just feel like it's going slower\nversus actually being slower.\n\n62\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.410\n>> So,\none of the things that we can't do, Don,\n\n63\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.370\nis just rely on some kind of\nsubjective feeling that says,\n\n64\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.390\nhey, performance is horrible\nbecause I think it is.\n\n65\n00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.940\nWe need something that's a little bit more\nconcrete, something that's a little more\n\n66\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.270\ntangible, and we can verify whether\nthe performance has actually waned or\n\n67\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.760\nit's just not performing like it was,\nlet's say, in the laptop two years ago.\n\n68\n00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.870\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\nonce we have those hard numbers,\n\n69\n00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.810\nit's very easy to create\nalerts in your system.\n\n70\n00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.690\nThey can warn you when you\ndeviated from that baseline.\n\n71\n00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.350\nBut having the baseline is important.\n\n72\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.160\nYou've got to create a baseline profile\nfor your production environment.\n\n73\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.710\nYou have to.\n\n74\n00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.270\nYou've got to have one of this things\nbecause otherwise you're just guessing.\n\n75\n00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.530\nI got some calls in from the field.\n\n76\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.430\nThe user said the system is slow.\n\n77\n00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.000\nWhat's slow to them?\n\n78\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000\nWhat's slow to me?\n\n79\n00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.470\nIt's different.\n\n80\n00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.020\nWe don't necessarily know, so\nwe've got to create that base line.\n\n81\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.810\nNow the hardest part about a base\nline is you're measuring stuff that's\n\n82\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.860\nrunning well.\n\n83\n00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.100\nWhen you're troubleshooting a problem,\nyou know what to look for.\n\n84\n00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.820\nI've got some disk problems so\nlet me go grab these disk counters, but\n\n85\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.610\nwhen things are running well, it's kind\nof hard to say well what do I measure?\n\n86\n00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.160\nWhat is as good indicator?\n\n87\n00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.080\nSo you've got to be familiar with that.\n\n88\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.340\nUnderstand that whatever\nvirtualization platform you're using,\n\n89\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.030\nwhoever manufactured\nthat platform knows best.\n\n90\n00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.110\nSo if you're running VMware ESX,\nVMware knows what you should monitor.\n\n91\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.260\nAnd if you're running Hyper V,\nMicrosoft knows what you should monitor.\n\n92\n00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.020\nIf you're running Amazon AWS or\nMicrosoft Azure, again,\n\n93\n00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.210\nthey know what you should monitor and\nwhat your baseline should be.\n\n94\n00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.170\nSo my first piece of advice to you is,\n\n95\n00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.846\nif you're ready to create a baseline,\ndon't just jump right into it.\n\n96\n00:04:17.846 --> 00:04:18.500\nGo to your vendors.\n\n97\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.990\nGo to your vendor documentation.\n\n98\n00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.360\nThey all produce great guides.\n\n99\n00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.690\nVMware is one of the best ones here.\n\n100\n00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.770\nI've got it pulled up on my laptop here.\n\n101\n00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.990\nThis is the vSphere Monitoring and\nPerformance Guide.\n\n102\n00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.370\nVia more updates that with this\nwith every version of vSphere.\n\n103\n00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.810\nSo this is the version six guide, but\nthey have a five five guide, a five one,\n\n104\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.280\na five 0, and all the way back.\n\n105\n00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.540\nI think the first guide that I used\nwas the 2.0 or something like that.\n\n106\n00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.790\nSo it was a while back.\n\n107\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.540\nBut they've been producing\nthese guides for a long time,\n\n108\n00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.220\nand what they do is they tell you\nhow to monitor their systems.\n\n109\n00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.240\nHow do you monitor that ESX server to\nknow that it's running the right way?\n\n110\n00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.540\nWhat do you need to gather for\nyour baseline?\n\n111\n00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.780\nAnd then compare that to what's\nrunning and what you do.\n\n112\n00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.030\nAnd these guides that, they're free.\n\n113\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.010\nThey're right on the website.\n\n114\n00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.680\nYou just go and get them.\n\n115\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.230\nI'll post the link to this in\nthe show notes with the show.\n\n116\n00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.570\nBut what they do is,\n\n117\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.760\nthey break down that important\npart of monitoring your inventory.\n\n118\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.260\nWe need to monitor\nthe systems that we've got.\n\n119\n00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.960\nAnd as we monitor them, now we can start\nto recognize when we've got a problem.\n\n120\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.760\nAnd, be aware that there's times where\nyou want to monitor your host, and\n\n121\n00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.650\nthen some times where you\nwant to monitor your guests.\n\n122\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.350\nThere's some things that are very\nvisible from the host side.\n\n123\n00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.430\nThere are some things that are only\nvisible from the guest side.\n\n124\n00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.110\nFor example, network bandwidth.\n\n125\n00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.940\nIf I am monitoring network\nbandwidth from the hosts,\n\n126\n00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.720\nI am seeing the aggregated\nbandwidth of all of my guests.\n\n127\n00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.650\nSo if I am running out of bandwidth\nthe hosts will see that, but\n\n128\n00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.700\nit won't necessarily know which of\nthe VMs it is that's causing that.\n\n129\n00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.980\nBut if I monitor inside of the guests,\nI can see exactly who's consuming that\n\n130\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.910\nbandwidth, and I can even break it down\nfurther to find out what application.\n\n131\n00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.020\nSo we'll normally do\na combination of the two.\n\n132\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.110\nMonitoring from the inside of the guests,\nand monitoring from the host itself.\n\n133\n00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.730\nNow that can be challenging\nwith some platforms,\n\n134\n00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.810\nlike with ESX,\nwhere you can't really log into the host.\n\n135\n00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.300\nIt just displays a text-based terminal and\nthat's it.\n\n136\n00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.860\nSo we've got to monitor it with external\nsoftware, and VMware vSphere does that.\n\n137\n00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.580\nWith Windows as a guest, though, you could\nmonitor right from inside of the guest, or\n\n138\n00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.370\nLinux as a guest.\n\n139\n00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.660\nYou could monitor right from inside of it,\nversus the host,\n\n140\n00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.630\nwhere you may not be able to.\n\n141\n00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.860\nSo, you'll have to kind of gauge\nthat based on your platform.\n\n142\n00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.160\nBut they break through and show\neverything, what events to monitor for,\n\n143\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.470\nwhat alarms to create,\n\n144\n00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.080\nwhat automated actions you can\ncreate to alleviate those problems.\n\n145\n00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.200\nIt is a wealth of information.\n\n146\n00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.270\nAnd if you're using VM or ESX,\nyou should have read this guide.\n\n147\n00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.330\nAnd if you haven't,\nI definitely recommend it.\n\n148\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.040\nIt's not a terribly long one.\n\n149\n00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.270\nI think it's 170 pages.\n\n150\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.800\nYou can read it in about a day, and\n\n151\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.290\nit'll tell you everything you need to\nknow about monitoring and optimizing ESX.\n\n152\n00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.930\nVMware does a great job of this.\n\n153\n00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.140\nSo do other vendors.\n\n154\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.540\nMaybe not as great, so for\nexample, Microsoft's Hyper-V,\n\n155\n00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.840\nthey've got a whole article series\ncalled Tuning for Hyper-V servers.\n\n156\n00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.180\nThis is getting your hardware to where\nit can run the most optimally, and\n\n157\n00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.080\nthen once it's optimized,\nyou just watch those settings.\n\n158\n00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.300\nAny time you deviate from those\nsettings you know you've got a problem.\n\n159\n00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.750\nIt's very, very straight forward.\n\n160\n00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.650\nAnd so they go through and\n\n161\n00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.660\nthey break all that down,\nprocessor, memory, storage, network.\n\n162\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.310\nThe four horsemen, as Wes calls them.\n\n163\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.400\nThose guys are right there.\n\n164\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.820\nHow do we tune and optimize our systems,\nkeep them running smoothly?\n\n165\n00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.310\nAnd when you jump into some of\nthese things, like if we take,\n\n166\n00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.910\nI'll do processor, I guess.\n\n167\n00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.520\nWhen you start breaking in here,\n\n168\n00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.480\nit'll show you the actual performance\ncounters to watch out for, and\n\n169\n00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.480\nnotice these performance\ncounters that they're tracking.\n\n170\n00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.330\nThey're not just tracking\npercent processor time,\n\n171\n00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.996\nwhich we usually monitor in a host.\n\n172\n00:07:41.996 --> 00:07:46.297\nThey're monitoring Hyper-V,\nHyperVisor Logical Processor percent,\n\n173\n00:07:46.297 --> 00:07:50.040\ntotal run time or, guest run time,\nHyperVisor run time.\n\n174\n00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.830\nSo you can identify not that just\nyour CPU is high but, who it is.\n\n175\n00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.475\nWho it is that's consuming\nthat CPU utilization.\n\n176\n00:07:57.475 --> 00:08:02.283\nAnd knowing which counters to monitor\nThat's the real challenge with this stuff.\n\n177\n00:08:02.283 --> 00:08:05.450\nHow do I know exactly what I\nwant to monitor and gather?\n\n178\n00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.850\nAnd so this little article right here,\nthey break it down.\n\n179\n00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.730\nIf we get down in to memory\nthey break it down there.\n\n180\n00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.290\nSame thing with network and\nthe other ones, disc io and so on.\n\n181\n00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.160\nTons of different ways to monitor and\ntrack that performance.\n\n182\n00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.670\nSo rule number one, rely on the vendor\nof your virtualization platform.\n\n183\n00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.130\nThey've got guides that tell\nyou exactly what to monitor.\n\n184\n00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.500\nYou can build you baselines off of that.\n\n185\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.470\nYou can also optimized and\ntune your environment based on that.\n\n186\n00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.950\nSo you're not left on your own, right.\n\n187\n00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:36.040\nNow we're gonna show you in this episode\nand in Part II how to actually tweak and\n\n188\n00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.760\ntune these things even if you\ndidn't have these guides.\n\n189\n00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.930\nBut these guides,\nthey're worth their weight in gold.\n\n190\n00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.400\nDefinitely make use of them.\n\n191\n00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.330\n>> One of the things that I've seen inside\nof like, let's say the traditional Window.\n\n192\n00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.370\nI say traditional just cuz I've\ncome from a Windows environment.\n\n193\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.860\nLike the performance monitor.\n\n194\n00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.980\nYou might be saying well Don, why don't\nwe just go ahead and put all the counter,\n\n195\n00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.730\nall the stuff that we want to monitor.\n\n196\n00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.150\nWhy don't we monitor everything?\n\n197\n00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.940\nWell then the problem is it takes you\nfive days to get through the whole entire\n\n198\n00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.890\nreport and you've got maybe 20% of it,\nmaybe even more,\n\n199\n00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.780\nmaybe 50% of it that's just arbitrary.\n\n200\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.030\nIt does nothing for you and\nit gets more confusing.\n\n201\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.480\nSo like Don said, these base lines\ncan save you a lot of headache right?\n\n202\n00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.630\n>> Yeah, and it kinda also goes\nback to that saying of, what is it?\n\n203\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.170\nThe road to hell is paved\nwith good intentions?\n\n204\n00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:16.780\n>> That's right.\n\n205\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.890\n>> A lot of people set out and\nthey create these great base lines and\n\n206\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.450\nsay here's how my system is gonna\nlook when it's running properly.\n\n207\n00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.500\nAnd they gather all this data.\n\n208\n00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.190\nRight?\n\n209\n00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.740\nBut then they never actually use it.\n\n210\n00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.720\nYou end up with this huge pool of\ndata that's just sitting there\n\n211\n00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.240\nuseless never getting used.\n\n212\n00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.010\nAnd so\nit's up to us to make sure we apply that.\n\n213\n00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.210\nSo if I take a base line I know how\nmy system should perform normally and\n\n214\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.350\nwhen somebody calls and says the system is\nrunning slowly, I should be able to repeat\n\n215\n00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.780\nthat base line, gather the same data,\nand then compare the two.\n\n216\n00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.200\nAnd so I need to know how to do that.\n\n217\n00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.814\nWhatever software it is I'm using I\nneed to know how to run a comparison so\n\n218\n00:09:49.814 --> 00:09:53.668\nthat I can actually identify like Wes\nsaid earlier the hard numbers to know for\n\n219\n00:09:53.668 --> 00:09:56.177\na fact yes the system is\nrunning slower right now.\n\n220\n00:09:56.177 --> 00:10:00.191\nSo in best practices, one of the things\nthat we want to do here, right.\n\n221\n00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:05.490\nLike Don's mentioning here, we don't\nwant to create one test and then a month\n\n222\n00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:10.650\ndown the road run a completely separate\ntest and then try to compare the two.\n\n223\n00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.262\nYou're comparing apples to oranges and\nthere's nothing,\n\n224\n00:10:13.262 --> 00:10:15.834\nthat information basically is\ngoing to be fairly useless.\n\n225\n00:10:15.834 --> 00:10:18.532\nSo, consistency in your baselines\nis another thing, right Don?\n\n226\n00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:21.784\n>> Yeah and,\nI'm gonna break the rules, Wes.\n\n227\n00:10:21.784 --> 00:10:23.170\nI'm gonna jump ahead in the show-\n>> Sure.\n\n228\n00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.500\n>> Now to something that I was saving for\nthe end of the episode.\n\n229\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.640\nI wanna mention change management,\nall right?\n\n230\n00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.000\nChange management, we talked\nabout it in another episode, too,\n\n231\n00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.840\nwith our ITIL practices,\nthat your network changes.\n\n232\n00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.220\nYour needs change.\n\n233\n00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:39.070\nSo when you take your baseline, that's\nhow your system performed at that time.\n\n234\n00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.760\nBut changes have happened, right?\n\n235\n00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.520\nMaybe you've deployed\na few more web servers.\n\n236\n00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.050\nMaybe your company hired\na few hundred more employees.\n\n237\n00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.980\nMaybe you rolled out some new\nservice to your customer.\n\n238\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:52.460\nBut your network changed, and as a result,\nyes your servers might be running slower,\n\n239\n00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.790\nbut it's just because your\nnetwork is changed now.\n\n240\n00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.430\nIt's different than when\nthat baseline was taken.\n\n241\n00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.580\nSo when you take a baseline, it's not\nthat you just take a baseline once and\n\n242\n00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.990\nforget it, right?\n\n243\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.330\nEvery time a change comes through, you\ngotta remember the impact of that change.\n\n244\n00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.660\nIt impacts whatever service\nis being modified, but\n\n245\n00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.200\nit impacts your baselines, also.\n\n246\n00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.030\nAnd you've gotta update the baselines and\nsay the baseline it took last year,\n\n247\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.630\nthat's how my network was last year.\n\n248\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.870\nBut we just rolled out 20 new servers.\n\n249\n00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.240\nI need an all new baseline.\n\n250\n00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.730\nAnd so you've gotta continually update\nthe baselines and you've gotta do it\n\n251\n00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.630\nwhen your system is running properly,\nwhen things are running normally.\n\n252\n00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.640\nNot when there's some red light\nblinking on your server status page,\n\n253\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.780\nthat you've got some problem out there.\n\n254\n00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.160\nThat's not the time to take a baseline,\nright?\n\n255\n00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.560\nYou need things running nice and\nnormal and smooth, grab that baseline.\n\n256\n00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.350\nKeep it updated over time so\nyou've got that good, clean comparison.\n\n257\n00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.980\nSo keep track of change management.\n\n258\n00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.520\nAny time a change ticket goes through,\n\n259\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.970\nyou've got to review it to see if it\nneeds you to generate a new baseline.\n\n260\n00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.220\nAll right, now, in the chatroom one of\nthe guys mentioned information overload.\n\n261\n00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.515\nRight?\nIf we gather all of this data,\n\n262\n00:11:53.515 --> 00:11:55.795\nwe build up these sweet baselines,\nit is a lot of information.\n\n263\n00:11:55.795 --> 00:11:59.018\nAnd if we don't know what to do with it,\nit's useless information, so\n\n264\n00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:01.185\nI encourage you guys to\nlearn what to do with it.\n\n265\n00:12:01.185 --> 00:12:02.363\nIf you read the optimization and\n\n266\n00:12:02.363 --> 00:12:04.855\ntuning guides form the vendors\nthey'll tell you what to do with it.\n\n267\n00:12:04.855 --> 00:12:05.969\nBut let's say you're in a hurry.\n\n268\n00:12:05.969 --> 00:12:09.353\nI just dont have time to deal with it or\nit's not that you're in a hurry it's\n\n269\n00:12:09.353 --> 00:12:11.680\nthat you've got more servers\nthat you can manage.\n\n270\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.198\nThere's many, if I could see you guys,\n\n271\n00:12:14.198 --> 00:12:18.137\nraise your hand if you would in\nan under staffed IT department.\n\n272\n00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:20.210\nI think everybody would raise their hand,\nright?\n\n273\n00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.500\nWe never have enough personnel.\n\n274\n00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.580\nYou never have enough\nfree time in your day.\n\n275\n00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.780\nAnd if you're managing 1000\nvirtualization hosts and there's two or\n\n276\n00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.210\nthree of you supporting that server farm,\nit's just too much.\n\n277\n00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.400\nAnd so a lot of times, we're gonna\nleverage third party software and\n\n278\n00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.790\nlet me tell you,\nthere is some great software out there.\n\n279\n00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:42.340\nVMware VSphere and Microsoft's Hyper-V,\nthe SCVMM even, they allow you to\n\n280\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.840\nsee the performance metrics but they don't\ndo a lot of good interpretation for you.\n\n281\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.510\nEven SCOM, the full\nSystem Center Operations Manager for\n\n282\n00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.920\nMicrosoft doesn't do a lot\nof great interpretation.\n\n283\n00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.900\nIt'll tell you when there's a problem but\n\n284\n00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.760\nit doesn't help you kind\nof get to that solution.\n\n285\n00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.000\nIt's up to you to interpret it and\nmake use of it.\n\n286\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.860\nBut there are some great third\nparty products out there that will\n\n287\n00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.730\nnot only give you the information, they'll\ninterpret it and tell you ways to fix it.\n\n288\n00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.840\nAnd that's really awesome stuff.\n\n289\n00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.050\nYou know one of those products.\n\n290\n00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.750\nLet me show you guys this one.\n\n291\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.720\nIt's from a company called Veeam or Veeam,\nI'm not exactly sure how you say that one,\n\n292\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.240\nbut these guys they make\na product called Veeam ONE.\n\n293\n00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.210\nAnd it can monitor VMware environments,\nand it does an amazing job.\n\n294\n00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.650\nIt can actually monitor other things too.\n\n295\n00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.950\nBut it was originally designed for VMware.\n\n296\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.830\nAnd what it does, is it collects all the\ndata that you would need in a baseline.\n\n297\n00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.300\nSo, it supports building a baseline for\nyou.\n\n298\n00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.720\nAnd once that's done,\nit can monitor your servers.\n\n299\n00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.600\nAnd if anything ever gets out of whack,\nit can tell you what to do.\n\n300\n00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.550\nAnd in some cases,\nit can even fix it for you.\n\n301\n00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.330\nThings like moving virtual\nmachine guests around.\n\n302\n00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.280\nSo you might have one host\nthat's getting overloaded, so\n\n303\n00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.540\nyou can kinda rearrange your systems.\n\n304\n00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.200\nAt a minimum it can monitor it.\n\n305\n00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.540\nThey have a free edition if you\never wanna play around with it, but\n\n306\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.740\nthe way the system works\nis pretty straightforward.\n\n307\n00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.360\nIt reaches out there and\ncollects your data.\n\n308\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.080\nYou can kinda see this dashboard here.\n\n309\n00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.060\nSo they've got all their systems, and\nif there's errors being generated,\n\n310\n00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.020\nit collects those.\n\n311\n00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.490\nYou can see it and kind of monitor that\nperformance and activity in your system.\n\n312\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.293\nSo it's really impressive.\n\n313\n00:14:08.293 --> 00:14:12.332\nTheir free version does do health and\nconfiguration assessment.\n\n314\n00:14:12.332 --> 00:14:16.000\nIt does 24 by 7 monitoring and\nall that really good stuff.\n\n315\n00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.070\nIf you go with the pro version,\n\n316\n00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.350\nit does all sorts of other\nconfiguration and assessment.\n\n317\n00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.140\nIt can actually deploy servers.\n\n318\n00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.430\nReally powerful stuff.\n\n319\n00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.030\nIt's good software.\n\n320\n00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.630\nAnother one that I used, there used\nto be this company called Quest, and\n\n321\n00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.150\nthey used to make this great suite of\nsoftware that was called Spotlight.\n\n322\n00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.190\nAnd they had Spotlight\non active directory and\n\n323\n00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.020\nSpotlight on exchange, and\nthen all these other products, and\n\n324\n00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.850\nit would give you this amazing graphical\ndashboard and I keep talking about it in\n\n325\n00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.080\nthe past tense because they kind\nof disappeared for a while.\n\n326\n00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.080\nBut what happened is Dell bought them and\n\n327\n00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.230\nit got turned into Dell's\nfoglight software.\n\n328\n00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.500\nAnd it is another great product that\nyou can point at your VMWare and\n\n329\n00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.780\nHyper V servers and\nit knows the data to collect.\n\n330\n00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.690\nAnd it knows how to interpret it and it\nknows how to give you those suggestions.\n\n331\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.700\nAnd much like the Veeam ONE,\n\n332\n00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.930\nthey've got a free version that\nyou can deploy and play with.\n\n333\n00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.700\nBut they've got the paid versions,\nso the really impressive ones.\n\n334\n00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.600\nAnd what it'll do is basically reach\nout and, that's not what I wanted.\n\n335\n00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.520\nI wanted the tour.\n\n336\n00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.240\nThey've got like a screenshot tour.\n\n337\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.380\nThere we go.\n\n338\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.180\nWhat it'll do is it'll reach out and\ncollect that performance data on your\n\n339\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.640\nsystem, and I know it's kinda hard to see\nhere but they basically got like a little\n\n340\n00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.870\nbar here, which would be the warning bar,\nand then where your current status is,\n\n341\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.120\nand if you ever hit that\nlimit then you get a warning.\n\n342\n00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.300\nYou get these alarms, and it's\nmapping your system, it's tracking it.\n\n343\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.320\nAnd you really get to\nsee a lot of good stuff.\n\n344\n00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.800\nNow, I'm going to talk a little\nbit more about this later on.\n\n345\n00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.950\nBut when we monitor things,\n\n346\n00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:44.440\nit's more important to monitor our\nservices than our actual resources.\n\n347\n00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.360\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n348\n00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.400\nWell when you have a server,\nwe've got those big four right?\n\n349\n00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.591\nThe processor, memory, disk, and network.\n\n350\n00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:54.609\nAnd those are all things that\ncause bottlenecks in the network.\n\n351\n00:15:54.609 --> 00:15:58.371\nBut most applications these days don't\nrun on just one server, do they?\n\n352\n00:15:58.371 --> 00:15:59.996\nThey involve more than one server.\n\n353\n00:15:59.996 --> 00:16:04.595\nYou might have a load balancer, a handful\nof web front-ends that are load balanced.\n\n354\n00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:06.781\nYou might have database\nservers on the back-end and\n\n355\n00:16:06.781 --> 00:16:09.174\neven application servers\ndoing processing on the side.\n\n356\n00:16:09.174 --> 00:16:12.370\nYou might have more than one\ntier to your application.\n\n357\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.479\nThere's a lot of systems use\nmid-tier stuff these days.\n\n358\n00:16:14.479 --> 00:16:17.180\nAnd if you've got\na multi-tiered application,\n\n359\n00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.562\nyou could have a bottleneck at any one of\nthe tiers throughout that application.\n\n360\n00:16:21.562 --> 00:16:25.092\nSo the web front ends might be running\nfine and the database on the back end is\n\n361\n00:16:25.092 --> 00:16:28.022\nrunning slow, and\nthat causes your application to run slow.\n\n362\n00:16:28.022 --> 00:16:31.094\nWell, when you use fog light,\nit lets you map this out.\n\n363\n00:16:31.094 --> 00:16:32.883\nSo, we got front-end time.\n\n364\n00:16:32.883 --> 00:16:35.493\nWe've got our medical records\nservers one and two and\n\n365\n00:16:35.493 --> 00:16:39.498\nthe medical records database and there's\nan IP here, which is a load balancer and\n\n366\n00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:42.590\nthey're monitoring performance\nall throughout that chain.\n\n367\n00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.780\nAnd so\nif there is ever performance degradation,\n\n368\n00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.294\nthey can identify where it's\nhappening in that string.\n\n369\n00:16:47.294 --> 00:16:50.025\nThis is service monitoring and\nthat's a key piece,\n\n370\n00:16:50.025 --> 00:16:52.390\nit is really hard to\nmonitor that on your own.\n\n371\n00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.186\nYou have to have a really good\nunderstanding of all the pieces in\n\n372\n00:16:55.186 --> 00:16:55.780\nthe puzzle.\n\n373\n00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.830\nAnd if this mid-tier is auto-scaling,\nI might have 2 servers now and\n\n374\n00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:04.501\n20 servers an hour from now and monitoring\nthat manually is next to impossible.\n\n375\n00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:07.525\nHaving systems like this that understand\nthe application infrastructure is\n\n376\n00:17:07.525 --> 00:17:08.274\nreally valuable.\n\n377\n00:17:08.274 --> 00:17:10.383\n>> One of the things,\nlooking at that right there,\n\n378\n00:17:10.383 --> 00:17:11.984\nthe heads up system's really good.\n\n379\n00:17:11.984 --> 00:17:16.194\nI have spotlight on Windows and\nit was really, really good.\n\n380\n00:17:16.194 --> 00:17:21.552\nJust in the fact that the visual\ninterface could get you to the problem.\n\n381\n00:17:21.552 --> 00:17:23.602\nWhatever the component was\nthat was having the problem,\n\n382\n00:17:23.602 --> 00:17:24.934\nit could get you there really quick.\n\n383\n00:17:24.934 --> 00:17:27.665\nLike to take an example, the page file.\n\n384\n00:17:27.665 --> 00:17:30.020\nThe spotlight for Windows,\na little bit different.\n\n385\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.901\nBut if paging was through the roof or\nif the page file was set incorrectly,\n\n386\n00:17:33.901 --> 00:17:36.039\nall I had to do was launch the interface.\n\n387\n00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:38.031\nThe UI comes up and\nyou can see it right away, so\n\n388\n00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:41.375\nthat it looks like they've done the same\nthing for the enterprise class too.\n\n389\n00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:42.687\n>> Yeah, absolutely and\n\n390\n00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:46.910\nthe cool part about this software is\nthat you don't have to be an expert.\n\n391\n00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:47.874\nYou can fire up the software.\n\n392\n00:17:47.874 --> 00:17:49.046\nYou can add your host to it.\n\n393\n00:17:49.046 --> 00:17:49.790\nIt'll monitor.\n\n394\n00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:54.259\nThey know what to watch for and you'll\nget that information all succinctly in\n\n395\n00:17:54.259 --> 00:17:57.851\nan actionable form that you're\nready to go in and make use of.\n\n396\n00:17:57.851 --> 00:17:58.791\nSo, that's great stuff.\n\n397\n00:17:58.791 --> 00:18:02.171\nIn a real world,\nyou're gonna use this stuff.\n\n398\n00:18:02.171 --> 00:18:05.952\nFor the exam, [LAUGH] we do need to\nknow how to gather this stuff ourselves.\n\n399\n00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:08.696\nSo we're gonna do it by hand for\nthe rest of the series, but\n\n400\n00:18:08.696 --> 00:18:10.600\nI wanted to make sure I addressed those.\n\n401\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.190\nBecause in real life,\nthat's what you're gonna see.\n\n402\n00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.859\nYou're going to use that\nstuff in real life land.\n\n403\n00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:17.469\n>> Now I'm gonna probably throw\na curve ball here at you, Don.\n\n404\n00:18:17.469 --> 00:18:21.302\nNow with these different third\nparty interfaces in a past episode,\n\n405\n00:18:21.302 --> 00:18:25.081\nwe talked about some of the ways\nthat you can monitor your systems.\n\n406\n00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:30.632\nWe mentioned a simple network management\nprotocol SNMP, I forgot the acronym there.\n\n407\n00:18:30.632 --> 00:18:36.224\nDon, mentioned things like WMI and some of\nthese attributes that they're monitoring.\n\n408\n00:18:36.224 --> 00:18:38.384\nWould it be safe to say, Don,\nthat these third party software,\n\n409\n00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:39.672\nobviously, they're proprietary.\n\n410\n00:18:39.672 --> 00:18:41.665\nSo they're not going to\ntell us everything, but\n\n411\n00:18:41.665 --> 00:18:44.873\nthey're using some of that information\nto bring that into their interface and\n\n412\n00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:46.486\nthen interpret that logic for them.\n\n413\n00:18:46.486 --> 00:18:47.164\n>> Certainly.\n>> Yeah.\n\n414\n00:18:47.164 --> 00:18:47.755\n>> Without a doubt.\n\n415\n00:18:47.755 --> 00:18:49.614\nSome of them are agent based.\n\n416\n00:18:49.614 --> 00:18:55.155\nSo, you have to install a little program\non the VMWare host or ESX, whatever it is.\n\n417\n00:18:55.155 --> 00:18:56.362\nYou have to install this\nlittle program on there.\n\n418\n00:18:56.362 --> 00:19:01.260\nSome of them do just use SNMP, they all\nuse WMI for gathering that from Hyper-V.\n\n419\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.592\nSo cool part though is all the background\nand we don't really have to sweat that,\n\n420\n00:19:04.592 --> 00:19:06.950\nit kinda takes care of it and\nit gathers the information.\n\n421\n00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.969\nSome of them do use proprietary\ntechnologies to gather the data though,\n\n422\n00:19:09.969 --> 00:19:11.211\nthat is certainly possible.\n\n423\n00:19:11.211 --> 00:19:15.350\nBut again, once you get it set up,\njust harvest that data.\n\n424\n00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.160\nLet's say, we have to do this by hand.\n\n425\n00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.701\nIf we have to do it by hand, it's up to\nus to learn what metrics to go out and\n\n426\n00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:24.440\ngather and to use those metrics to then\ngo and assemble and build a baseline.\n\n427\n00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.240\nAnd so, I'm gonna use this Hyper-V\nserver that I've got pull up here.\n\n428\n00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.461\nThis is a Hyper-V server that Mike Rodrick\none of the host was using in another show,\n\n429\n00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:34.740\nI stole it from him this morning and\nhe's gonna Hyper-V on here.\n\n430\n00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.348\nIt's got a couple of virtual\nmachines that are up and running.\n\n431\n00:19:37.348 --> 00:19:41.191\nHere we've got a couple of domain\ncontrollers, some kind of router.\n\n432\n00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:44.701\nJust a few different devices up and\nrunning on it and\n\n433\n00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:46.668\nit's just a Hyper-V host.\n\n434\n00:19:46.668 --> 00:19:51.056\nAnd if I wanna monitor performance for\nthis system and see how things are going,\n\n435\n00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:53.890\nI need to create baseline and\nget that put in place.\n\n436\n00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.091\nWell, in Windows,\n\n437\n00:19:55.091 --> 00:19:59.545\nwe have a neat little utility called\nthe Windows Performance Monitor and so\n\n438\n00:19:59.545 --> 00:20:04.160\nI can jump into that performance monitor\nand I can start to build my baseline.\n\n439\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.275\nNow, the performance monitor by default\nis just gathering real time data.\n\n440\n00:20:08.275 --> 00:20:11.525\nSo if I go like here to my performance\nmonitor screen, I'm gonna see server real\n\n441\n00:20:11.525 --> 00:20:14.790\ntime data and the only thing it's really\nshowing me is percent processor time.\n\n442\n00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.834\nSo, here's how busy my CPU is right now.\n\n443\n00:20:17.834 --> 00:20:19.405\nWell, the problem with this is,\nit's not recorded.\n\n444\n00:20:19.405 --> 00:20:20.986\nI can't use this as my baseline,\n\n445\n00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:24.840\nthis is just something it's doing right\nnow and it's kinda just sitting there.\n\n446\n00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.271\nSo what I need to do is I need to create\nwhat is called a Data Collector Set and\n\n447\n00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:33.844\na Data Collector Set is a set of metrics\nthat I wanna gather that I can turn on,\n\n448\n00:20:33.844 --> 00:20:35.220\nand off when I want to.\n\n449\n00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.033\nSo I can turn it on and run it to build\nmy baseline and then in the future,\n\n450\n00:20:39.033 --> 00:20:43.237\nI can come and turn this on again whenever\nthings aren't performing right and\n\n451\n00:20:43.237 --> 00:20:45.000\nget numbers that I can compare.\n\n452\n00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.596\nSo with the Data Collector Set\nif we drill into this,\n\n453\n00:20:47.596 --> 00:20:51.140\nthere's actually some that are kind\nof defined by the system already.\n\n454\n00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.110\nLike this is one here,\nServer Manager Performance Monitor.\n\n455\n00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.045\nI didn't make that, the system actually\neven though it says, User Defined.\n\n456\n00:20:57.045 --> 00:21:00.737\nMicrosoft made this one and\nit's kind of like a default baseline for\n\n457\n00:21:00.737 --> 00:21:01.786\nWindows servers.\n\n458\n00:21:01.786 --> 00:21:03.690\nAnd so, I can use that default baseline.\n\n459\n00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.193\nBut from my system,\nI might wanna tweak that and\n\n460\n00:21:06.193 --> 00:21:08.270\nmodify what I'm gonna be monitoring.\n\n461\n00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.662\nIt's up to you what you\nwant to monitor with these.\n\n462\n00:21:10.662 --> 00:21:13.007\nAnd if you're using ESX or\nZen Server or KVM,\n\n463\n00:21:13.007 --> 00:21:15.806\nyou'll have different things\nto monitor for those.\n\n464\n00:21:15.806 --> 00:21:18.907\nAgain, you'll have to go to\nyour vendor documentation.\n\n465\n00:21:18.907 --> 00:21:21.982\nSo, what I'm going to do is maybe\nI'll just create an all new one here.\n\n466\n00:21:21.982 --> 00:21:23.727\nWe'll do an all New > Data Collector Set.\n\n467\n00:21:23.727 --> 00:21:29.365\nAnd when I create a new Data Collector\nSet, I just need to give it a name and\n\n468\n00:21:29.365 --> 00:21:33.626\nso I'll call this my\nHyper-V Performance Baseline.\n\n469\n00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:37.237\nSo this is gonna be what I use, just to\nget a snapshot of what my server looks\n\n470\n00:21:37.237 --> 00:21:40.056\nlike from normal and\nI can use a template if I've got one.\n\n471\n00:21:40.056 --> 00:21:43.256\nIf I know that they've got some of\nthe counters I want all ready or\n\n472\n00:21:43.256 --> 00:21:45.461\nI can just create it\nmanually from scratch.\n\n473\n00:21:45.461 --> 00:21:47.899\nIf I choose to use a template,\nit asks me to pick what I want.\n\n474\n00:21:47.899 --> 00:21:51.720\nAnd you've got System Diagnostics,\nSystem Performance and WDAC Diagnostics,\n\n475\n00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.726\nwhich I actually don't know what that is.\n\n476\n00:21:53.726 --> 00:21:56.730\nI'm sure it's amazing, but\nwe'll go with system performance instead,\n\n477\n00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.408\ncuz that's what I really care about all.\n\n478\n00:21:58.408 --> 00:22:01.862\nAnd that one is usually gonna have\nthe common things that Microsoft\n\n479\n00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:02.916\nrecommends for me.\n\n480\n00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:04.219\nSo now that I've got that in place,\n\n481\n00:22:04.219 --> 00:22:06.750\nI'm gonna edit that, cuz I don't\nreally know what's inside of it.\n\n482\n00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:11.800\nSo, I need to edit that and\nlook at what it actually monitoring.\n\n483\n00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.515\nAnd so\nkind of looking at the properties here,\n\n484\n00:22:14.515 --> 00:22:18.761\nit's got a few little things in it as\nfar as where it's gonna store its log\n\n485\n00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:23.493\nfiles and a schedule for when it's gonna\nrun and I don't really need any of that,\n\n486\n00:22:23.493 --> 00:22:28.400\nbut you can see the Keywords for searching\nfor are really nothing to exciting here.\n\n487\n00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.070\nI wanna be manually running this baseline.\n\n488\n00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.905\nSo, I'm not gonna run a schedule on it.\n\n489\n00:22:32.905 --> 00:22:34.961\nYou might choose to schedule these\nthings to run at a periodic time.\n\n490\n00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:38.031\nBut with the baseline,\nwe just normally manually run it.\n\n491\n00:22:38.031 --> 00:22:41.913\nNow inside of my baseline, notice that\nit's got a kernel trace running and\n\n492\n00:22:41.913 --> 00:22:43.340\nthe performance counter.\n\n493\n00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.778\nNow, what are these?\n\n494\n00:22:44.778 --> 00:22:46.299\nWell, the kernel trace,\n\n495\n00:22:46.299 --> 00:22:50.318\nthat's tracing what programs\nare running on my system at that time.\n\n496\n00:22:50.318 --> 00:22:54.438\nAnd if I'm monitoring a server that's\nrunning applications, I care about that.\n\n497\n00:22:54.438 --> 00:22:55.482\nI wanna know what\napplications are running.\n\n498\n00:22:55.482 --> 00:22:59.810\nBut if I've got a Hyper-V host, it should\nonly be running one thing, Hyper V.\n\n499\n00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.646\nI shouldn't be running anything else\non that host just Hyper-V and so\n\n500\n00:23:02.646 --> 00:23:04.954\nI don't necessarily care\nabout that colonial trace, so\n\n501\n00:23:04.954 --> 00:23:06.749\nI'm just going to delete\nthat out of there.\n\n502\n00:23:06.749 --> 00:23:09.974\nI don't need it and\nit's gonna ask, I'm sure.\n\n503\n00:23:09.974 --> 00:23:12.129\nBut performance counters,\nthat is what I care about.\n\n504\n00:23:12.129 --> 00:23:13.740\nSo, I'm gonna pull those properties up.\n\n505\n00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.268\nAnd now, I can start to see the\nperformance counters that it's monitoring\n\n506\n00:23:17.268 --> 00:23:18.840\nand it added quite a bit of stuff.\n\n507\n00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.000\nIt actually did a little bit\nof overkill in my opinion.\n\n508\n00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.270\nWe've got everything processed,\neverything physical disc,\n\n509\n00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.792\neverything processor related,\nmemory related, server related.\n\n510\n00:23:27.792 --> 00:23:31.823\nThere's a lot of stuff here and what the\nmeans is this thing is gonna collect a ton\n\n511\n00:23:31.823 --> 00:23:34.004\nof data that's well beyond what I wanted.\n\n512\n00:23:34.004 --> 00:23:35.976\nSo, I should haven't used\nthe template after all.\n\n513\n00:23:35.976 --> 00:23:37.910\nIt turns out they got\na little heavy handed on me.\n\n514\n00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.705\nSo I'm just gonna come in and remove all\nthese, and we're gonna add all the things\n\n515\n00:23:41.705 --> 00:23:45.335\nwe want, and this is where we would go\nlike the Microsoft guide or the VM guide,\n\n516\n00:23:45.335 --> 00:23:46.835\nand we will find out what to add.\n\n517\n00:23:46.835 --> 00:23:51.292\nBut if we just think about our four\nhorseman, our CPU, our memory and so on,\n\n518\n00:23:51.292 --> 00:23:53.324\nwe can go in and find these things.\n\n519\n00:23:53.324 --> 00:23:55.275\nSo for example, on processor utilization.\n\n520\n00:23:55.275 --> 00:23:57.641\nIf I go under processor We can come in and\n\n521\n00:23:57.641 --> 00:24:01.320\nwe can start to monitor based\non our percent processor time.\n\n522\n00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.310\nHow much time the processor\nstayed busy doing something?\n\n523\n00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.910\nHere's where things get tricky though.\n\n524\n00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.680\nWe normally just monitor the total.\n\n525\n00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.200\nI wanna know my total, my average,\nhow about my CPU's being busy.\n\n526\n00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.650\nBut when we start doing virtual machines,\nI can tie a virtual machine to\n\n527\n00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.860\none particular socket or\neven one particular core.\n\n528\n00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.400\nSo, I might have three cores\nthat are completely unused and\n\n529\n00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.230\nI might have one core\nthat's 100% utilization.\n\n530\n00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.873\nIf I monitor the total that would\nshow up as 25% utilization.\n\n531\n00:24:28.873 --> 00:24:32.642\nAnd what I always tell myself is, hey,\nas long as I'm below 80% on average,\n\n532\n00:24:32.642 --> 00:24:34.630\nI've got plenty of CPU room.\n\n533\n00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.330\nSo in that scenario,\nthis server would show up as healthy.\n\n534\n00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.295\nWhen in reality one of my cores\nwas completely pegged out and\n\n535\n00:24:40.295 --> 00:24:43.830\nI've got a VM that's suffering\nbecause it's tied to one core.\n\n536\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.700\nSo, whereas we might\nnormally track an average,\n\n537\n00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.060\nwe really need to track individual cores.\n\n538\n00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.240\nAnd you can choose all instances and\nget all of it.\n\n539\n00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.870\nI'll get the average and the individual\ncores, so now I've got them both.\n\n540\n00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:56.110\nThat kind of covers us.\n\n541\n00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.590\nIt's also useful if I\nmight be adding more.\n\n542\n00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.770\nYou don't normally add cores,\nbut if I add more in the future,\n\n543\n00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.760\nthis would encompass that, too.\n\n544\n00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.780\nBut that's useful if you're gonna be\nexporting these performance counters and\n\n545\n00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.060\nimporting them to other systems, so\n\n546\n00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.670\nyou don't have to reinvent\nthe wheel over and over again.\n\n547\n00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.640\nYou can just choose in all instances,\nbut be careful with that.\n\n548\n00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.930\nThe other thing to be careful with,\nis that when I add that in,\n\n549\n00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:21.330\nthat's the processors from\nthe perspective of the host.\n\n550\n00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.040\nWhat about my VMs?\n\n551\n00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.724\nWell I could monitor from inside the VMs\ntoo but now I've got 100 different\n\n552\n00:25:27.724 --> 00:25:31.629\nplaces to go to get data, my host and\nthen all the different VMs.\n\n553\n00:25:31.629 --> 00:25:35.507\nBut in Hyper-V,\nI'm inside of just the processor window.\n\n554\n00:25:35.507 --> 00:25:39.846\nIf I hunt those,\na whole section on Hyper-V, right up here.\n\n555\n00:25:39.846 --> 00:25:44.368\nAnd inside of hyper-V you can start\nto look at the processors, for\n\n556\n00:25:44.368 --> 00:25:47.550\nexample, from the perspective of Hyper-V.\n\n557\n00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:51.470\nAnd so I've got the Hyper-V\nHypervisor Logical Processors and\n\n558\n00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.036\nif I look in here,\nI can find percent processor time.\n\n559\n00:25:55.036 --> 00:25:58.967\nThat percent Hyper-V, there's\nthe Hypervisor Run Time, guest Run Time,\n\n560\n00:25:58.967 --> 00:26:00.280\nthere we go.\n\n561\n00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.870\nAnd I can start to look at it in\nterms of the guests themselves.\n\n562\n00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.740\nAnd so right down here I start\nto see my logical processors.\n\n563\n00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:13.710\n0, 1, 2, and 3, those are my four cores\nbut in the logical form that my guest VMs\n\n564\n00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.960\nare gonna be taking, and so\nnow I get it from the view of Hyper-V.\n\n565\n00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.050\nNow if your server is just running\nHyper-V, this is the best place to look.\n\n566\n00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.210\nBut if you're running Hyper-V and\n\n567\n00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:26.010\nsome other services on your host, this is\nnot gonna include those other services.\n\n568\n00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.630\nSo it doesn't give me a complete view,\nright?\n\n569\n00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.220\nSo you've got to determine which of\nthese metrics are the best to view\n\n570\n00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.450\nwhen you check that out.\n\n571\n00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:37.500\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nmonitor the server itself though instead\n\n572\n00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.690\nof the individual guest just to\nmake sure I get that complete view.\n\n573\n00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:40.440\nCuz Mike set this up,\n\n574\n00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.880\nI don't necessarily know if he's\nrunning other things on it or not.\n\n575\n00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.260\nBut on the CPU side, getting that percent\nprocessor time, that's really useful.\n\n576\n00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.880\nAnd let me give you guys some practical\nbenchmarks here just so you know.\n\n577\n00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:54.550\nI said, I like to keep it where all\nof my cores are below 80% on average.\n\n578\n00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.290\nIt's okay to spike, it's okay to hit\n100% utilization from time to time.\n\n579\n00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.121\nBut if I'm consistently over 80%,\n\n580\n00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:03.440\nmy system doesn't have the horsepower\nto power my environment.\n\n581\n00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.590\nAnd I'm gonna have performance\nsuffering as a result.\n\n582\n00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:06.350\nSo I wanna get things lower.\n\n583\n00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:10.060\nFortunately, CPU is not usually\nthe bottleneck for most networks.\n\n584\n00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.140\nSo we don't normally have a problem there.\n\n585\n00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.680\nBut it certainly can be.\n\n586\n00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.380\nSo we wanna make sure we monitor that.\n\n587\n00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.910\nOn the CPU side,\nthat's the main one I look for.\n\n588\n00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.820\nThere's also another counter\nthat I like to look for,\n\n589\n00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.810\nwhich is the processor queue length.\n\n590\n00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.110\nSo let me get back under processor.\n\n591\n00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.520\nAnd under processor,\nthe counter that I'm looking for\n\n592\n00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.120\nis just called processor queue length,\nand let's see.\n\n593\n00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.040\nDo I not have it?\n\n594\n00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.290\nIt is buried in here somewhere.\n\n595\n00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.520\nActually, you know what,\nit's tucked under system.\n\n596\n00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.860\nLet me find it under system.\n\n597\n00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.500\nThat's the hardest part, there's\nlike hundreds of these counters and\n\n598\n00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.700\nknowing where to look for\nthe particular counter you're looking for.\n\n599\n00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.020\nThere it is, processor queue length.\n\n600\n00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.115\nNow, what is processor queue length?\n\n601\n00:27:50.115 --> 00:27:53.373\nWhat it is is basically\nhow many processes,\n\n602\n00:27:53.373 --> 00:27:57.820\nhow many threads basically,\nare waiting to get to a CPU.\n\n603\n00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.700\nI don't care what CPU,\njust to get to a CPU.\n\n604\n00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.850\nI have software that's trying to get\nto a CPU, but the CPUs are busy.\n\n605\n00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.260\nAnd we're having to wait in line.\n\n606\n00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.230\nOkay, now when I say wait in line,\n\n607\n00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.380\nthey might be waiting in line for\na few nanoseconds.\n\n608\n00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.260\nThis can be a very,\nvery short amount of time.\n\n609\n00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.900\nBut anytime you have to wait,\nthat's bad, right.\n\n610\n00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.670\nThis is like CPU wait time,\nis what it's called sometimes.\n\n611\n00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:21.350\nWhere you're trying to get to a CPU,\nand you just gotta wait.\n\n612\n00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.020\nThat means your system's gonna be slow.\n\n613\n00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.890\nIf you try to get to your CPU and\nyou get there, then you're gonna be fast,\n\n614\n00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.240\nit's as simple as that.\n\n615\n00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.610\nAnd so we want this process of queue\nlength to be as low as possible.\n\n616\n00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:31.964\nI know what your thinking,\nI'd like it to be zero.\n\n617\n00:28:31.964 --> 00:28:35.198\nWell I would too, but,\n[LAUGH] that's not always gonna happen.\n\n618\n00:28:35.198 --> 00:28:39.968\nAnd so my kind of rule of thumb on this\none is, I like to see it be 8 or less.\n\n619\n00:28:39.968 --> 00:28:43.500\nIf it's at 8, that's okay,\nif it's kind of in that range.\n\n620\n00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.550\nI think the official Microsoft\none is ten per CPU core.\n\n621\n00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:50.495\nSo if you have up to ten\nthreads waiting per core, so\n\n622\n00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:55.100\nif I have 4 cores, I could have 40\nthreads waiting, then that would be fine.\n\n623\n00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.428\nI like to see it lower, but again,\nit does come down to money, too.\n\n624\n00:28:58.428 --> 00:29:00.513\nYou've only got so\nmuch money to throw into these servers, so\n\n625\n00:29:00.513 --> 00:29:02.530\nyou've gotta make use of what you've got.\n\n626\n00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.100\nIf it's below ten per core,\n\n627\n00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.040\nyou're probably not gonna notice any\nsluggishness, cuz it's nanoseconds.\n\n628\n00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.390\nIt's really fast.\n\n629\n00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.570\nBut if it gets over that, that's when\nyou start seeing systems waiting.\n\n630\n00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.420\nAnd, unlike memory and network or\n\n631\n00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.360\nthose other things we can do with CPU,\nwhen you wait, you wait.\n\n632\n00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.200\nThere's no alternative.\n\n633\n00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.800\nThere's no like, swap disk for CPU cycles.\n\n634\n00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.110\nYou just wait.\n\n635\n00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:24.420\nAnd if you're using hyper-threading,\nit's even worse.\n\n636\n00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.046\nBecause with hyper-threading you assume\nthat there's this a virtual processor\n\n637\n00:29:28.046 --> 00:29:31.410\nthat's available 100% of the time but\nit oftentimes isn't.\n\n638\n00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.990\nAnd so\nwhen you've got a lot of CPU weight, or\n\n639\n00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:34.440\na lot of processor queue length,\n\n640\n00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.930\nit could be that your hyper-threading\nis not very effective.\n\n641\n00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.790\nAnd some people count those hyper-threaded\nprocessors as real processors.\n\n642\n00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.810\nI tell you guys, don't do that.\n\n643\n00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:46.810\nIf you've got a 4 core processor that\ncan hyper-thread, it'll show as 8 cores.\n\n644\n00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.640\nPretend you only have four.\n\n645\n00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.110\nDon't count on those other four\nbeing available because oftentimes,\n\n646\n00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:54.120\nthey aren't and\nit can really skew your numbers.\n\n647\n00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.540\nYou can think that your server has\nplenty available CPU resources\n\n648\n00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.770\nwhen in reality, you don't.\n\n649\n00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.491\nWhen in reality, those hyper-threaded\ncores are not always there and\n\n650\n00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:05.476\nthey might show a 0% utilization but\n\n651\n00:30:05.476 --> 00:30:09.767\nthat's because they can't be used because\nthe main CPUs are using them already.\n\n652\n00:30:09.767 --> 00:30:12.905\nSo, definitely, be careful with\nthat when you track these numbers.\n\n653\n00:30:12.905 --> 00:30:16.050\nAll right, so those are the two that\nI like to watch on the CPU side.\n\n654\n00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:19.690\nPercent processor time and processor queue\nlength, those give you a really good view\n\n655\n00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:24.260\nof the CPUs and whether or not,\nyou are overtaxing your hosts.\n\n656\n00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:28.210\nOn the memory side,\nwe've got a couple of counters there.\n\n657\n00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.850\nNow when you go to the performance guide,\nyou will find tons of counters there.\n\n658\n00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:33.150\nI am showing you guys the ones that\nI feel are the most important ones.\n\n659\n00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.950\nThe ones that I always monitor these.\n\n660\n00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.170\nThe ones that I'm showing you here\nare the ones that I always monitor,\n\n661\n00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:38.750\nwith no exception.\n\n662\n00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:40.720\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n663\n00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.620\nTomorrow, there's gonna be an exception,\nbut as of today, no exception.\n\n664\n00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.410\nSo on the memory side,\none of the ones I like to look for\n\n665\n00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.470\nis Page Reads per second and\nPage Writes per second.\n\n666\n00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:51.650\nThis is your memory I/O.\n\n667\n00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.990\nHow much data is going into memory and\ncoming out of memory?\n\n668\n00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:56.810\nHow much memory activity are we seeing?\n\n669\n00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:58.670\nAnd the reason I like to watch this,\n\n670\n00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:03.360\nis it can give us a good idea to see\nif our system is getting slower.\n\n671\n00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.410\nIf I'm having an excessive\namount of reads per second,\n\n672\n00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.750\nI can exceed what my memory's able to\nhandle and I can start to have latency.\n\n673\n00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.860\nLatency writing to memory\nbecause we have to wait.\n\n674\n00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:17.540\nNow having to wait to get to memory is one\nthing, being out of memory is another.\n\n675\n00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.570\nIf we're completely out of memory, then we\nstart getting swapped to hard drive and\n\n676\n00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:22.870\nthat's terrible.\n\n677\n00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.640\nBecause we measure memory\nspeeds in nanoseconds.\n\n678\n00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.930\nBut we measure disk\nspeeds in milliseconds.\n\n679\n00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.530\nIt's an order of magnitude different,\nvery, very slow.\n\n680\n00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.732\nSo I also like to monitor that stuff, too.\n\n681\n00:31:33.732 --> 00:31:36.270\nI wanna know if I'm swapping\nto disk cuz that's a problem.\n\n682\n00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.420\nAnd it's a problem in Linux, Windows,\nMac, they all have swap files,\n\n683\n00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.220\nthey all run out of memory, it happens.\n\n684\n00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.520\nWe've gotta track it.\n\n685\n00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.530\nSo let's take a look at some\nof those memory counters.\n\n686\n00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:47.010\nOver here,\nI'm gonna jump to the memory section, or\n\n687\n00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:50.850\nI will try to find it at least,\nit's in here somewhere.\n\n688\n00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:51.834\nThere is memory.\n\n689\n00:31:51.834 --> 00:31:56.409\nAnd the first one that I'm gonna look for\nin memory is the Page Reads per second.\n\n690\n00:31:56.409 --> 00:31:58.510\nAnd so I'm just gonna come down here and\nfind that.\n\n691\n00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:00.182\nPage reads per second.\n\n692\n00:32:00.182 --> 00:32:04.830\nYou also have pages per second, which is\nkind of a combination of reads and writes.\n\n693\n00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:06.550\nI like to monitor them separately.\n\n694\n00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:09.190\nOn the memory side,\nyou can monitor them together.\n\n695\n00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.360\nIt's kind of all the same.\n\n696\n00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.430\nBut on the disk side it's really\nimportant we monitor them separately, so\n\n697\n00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.940\nI've just gotten in the habit of\nmonitoring them separately here, too.\n\n698\n00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.579\nSo I'm gonna grab those page reads\nper second, and add that in.\n\n699\n00:32:19.579 --> 00:32:22.120\nAnd page writes per second,\nand add that in.\n\n700\n00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.020\nAll right.\n\n701\n00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.190\nNotice, you also have page input and\noutput per second?\n\n702\n00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.690\nRight.\n\n703\n00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.610\nThat's the actual number\nof pages that are going in\n\n704\n00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:31.840\nversus just the actual reads that occur.\n\n705\n00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.250\nSo, it's a little bit different as far\nas the data that's being written in and\n\n706\n00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:35.870\ndata coming out.\n\n707\n00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.338\nThe page reads and\nwrites are the ones we normally want.\n\n708\n00:32:39.338 --> 00:32:41.590\nAll right, so I've got those in.\n\n709\n00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:46.300\nThose, I usually expect to see, it kinda\ndepends on your memory or whatever,\n\n710\n00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.590\nbut on a normal system,\n\n711\n00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:51.650\nyou kind of expect to see the number\nwe get back here as something below 30.\n\n712\n00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:53.470\nYou don't wanna have a ton of reads and\n\n713\n00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.810\nwrites going on per second on\nyour RAM at any given time.\n\n714\n00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:00.060\nBut the more sticks you have, if you\nhave multi-channel RAM and all that,\n\n715\n00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.495\nyou can kinda get higher numbers.\n\n716\n00:33:01.495 --> 00:33:04.700\nSo you're gonna have to kind of dig\ninto your motherboard documentation to\n\n717\n00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.610\nfind out what's the right throughput\nlevel for your memory to interpret that.\n\n718\n00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:11.340\nAll right, another one.\n\n719\n00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.870\nLet's see, that was pages read and pages\nwrite, and you can get page input and\n\n720\n00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:19.760\npage output, and add those in just\nstraight up pages per second.\n\n721\n00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.870\nThose are all good ones to get so\nI'll go ahead and grab the other ones and\n\n722\n00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.269\nthrow them in, too.\n\n723\n00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:27.197\nAll right.\nSo that's the memory side of things,\n\n724\n00:33:27.197 --> 00:33:29.749\nnow I'm honoring my CPU and my memory.\n\n725\n00:33:29.749 --> 00:33:31.641\nNext, lets talk about disk, right?\n\n726\n00:33:31.641 --> 00:33:33.766\nDisk is really easy to measure.\n\n727\n00:33:33.766 --> 00:33:38.684\nWith disk, when you buy your hard drive,\nit has a certain speed to it.\n\n728\n00:33:38.684 --> 00:33:43.653\nA certain amount of RPMs, and it might be\na 7,200 RPM drive or a 15,000 RPM drive.\n\n729\n00:33:43.653 --> 00:33:46.570\nAnd that's going to affect it's speed and\nyou can't change that.\n\n730\n00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.490\nOnce you bought the disk, that's its speed\nso you don't really need to measure that.\n\n731\n00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:54.150\nSame thing with it's maximum read and\nwrite, if get a six gig,\n\n732\n00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:58.380\nfiber channel SATA or\nSAS disk, a 12 gigs SAS disk.\n\n733\n00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.450\nThat's its speed, that's what it can do.\n\n734\n00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:01.828\nBut I need to know if\nI'm running out of that.\n\n735\n00:34:01.828 --> 00:34:03.466\nIf I'm hitting that 12 gigs, right?\n\n736\n00:34:03.466 --> 00:34:06.606\nAnd when I'm exceeding that, I need\nto know that I've reached that point.\n\n737\n00:34:06.606 --> 00:34:10.254\nAnd so we do need to measure it even\nthough it's not something we can change.\n\n738\n00:34:10.254 --> 00:34:14.368\nBecause once we exceed it, there are\ntechniques we can use to get over that,\n\n739\n00:34:14.368 --> 00:34:17.196\nto ease off and\nget that tuned a little better for us,\n\n740\n00:34:17.196 --> 00:34:19.280\nwhich we'll see in the next episode.\n\n741\n00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.465\nSo I'm gonna hunt down physical disk here,\noops, that's not how I'm gonna do that.\n\n742\n00:34:23.465 --> 00:34:27.050\nSo I'm gonna hunt down physical\ndisk which I think I just passed.\n\n743\n00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.260\nThere it is.\n\n744\n00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.960\nAnd we'll add in some of these counters.\n\n745\n00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.360\nAnd the one I'm looking for\nfirst is average disk queue length.\n\n746\n00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.870\nJust like processor queue,\naverage disk queue length is how many\n\n747\n00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:41.470\nprograms are waiting to get to the disk,\nto read and write to the disk.\n\n748\n00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:44.640\nNow, this was a big\ndeal on spinning disks.\n\n749\n00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.474\nBut it's still a big deal on SSDs also.\n\n750\n00:34:47.474 --> 00:34:50.434\nAn SSD can only perform so\nmany operations at the same time.\n\n751\n00:34:50.434 --> 00:34:52.860\nAnd it's usually one, two or four.\n\n752\n00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.830\nDepending on the money you spent\non your solid state digital.\n\n753\n00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.910\nBut either way,\n\n754\n00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:59.655\nif it's getting more request than it\ncan handle at one time, you gotta wait.\n\n755\n00:34:59.655 --> 00:35:01.870\nAnd this queue length starts to build up.\n\n756\n00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:07.060\nAnd so, I like to track that to know how\nmany programs are waiting to get to disk,\n\n757\n00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.810\nand if it gets excessive,\nI'm gonna need to take action for that.\n\n758\n00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:14.310\nOkay, and I thought I hit add,\nbut then it, there we go.\n\n759\n00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:17.496\nNotice on this, with disk queue length,\nthe default is to measure total,\n\n760\n00:35:17.496 --> 00:35:18.695\nthat number is worthless.\n\n761\n00:35:18.695 --> 00:35:20.510\nRight?\nYou don't want the total disk queue\n\n762\n00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:24.620\nlength, you need to measure the disk\nqueue length on each drive individually.\n\n763\n00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.694\nBecause, I might add more\ndrives in the future,\n\n764\n00:35:26.694 --> 00:35:30.234\nif I'm connected to a SAN of some sort,\nI'll have LUNs that appear and disappear,\n\n765\n00:35:30.234 --> 00:35:31.916\nso I need to get each one individually.\n\n766\n00:35:31.916 --> 00:35:34.456\nSo I'm gonna make sure to\nchoose all instances, so\n\n767\n00:35:34.456 --> 00:35:36.298\nit tracks all of them individually.\n\n768\n00:35:36.298 --> 00:35:39.325\nYou'll see, I even got drives that\ndon't have drive letters here,\n\n769\n00:35:39.325 --> 00:35:42.730\nthat again I might start to use in the\nfuture, so I need to have those numbers.\n\n770\n00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.379\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna go and add that in.\n\n771\n00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:48.840\nAll right.\nWhat else do I have on disk?\n\n772\n00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.180\nAverage disk read and\naverage disk writes per second.\n\n773\n00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.900\nI love these guys because when you\ntalk about working with the disk,\n\n774\n00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.480\nwhen it starts to get saturated, your read\nand write performance starts the software.\n\n775\n00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.580\nAnd so if I'm exceeding the 12\ngig bandwidth limit or whatever.\n\n776\n00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.920\nI'm gonna see that suffer with\nmy average disk read or write.\n\n777\n00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.350\nI might start to see a climb,\nand then a plateau.\n\n778\n00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:11.490\nAnd when you see that plateau,\nthat's how you know you hit your limit.\n\n779\n00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.480\nYou hit the max that disc can handle and\n\n780\n00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.780\nit's time to do something\nto increase that speed.\n\n781\n00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:21.925\nSo I'm just gonna hunt down my average\ndisk reads and average disk writes.\n\n782\n00:36:21.925 --> 00:36:23.630\nAnd it's kind of written weird.\n\n783\n00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:29.690\nIts average Disk sec/Read, and\nsec/Write, so it's just kinda backwards.\n\n784\n00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:34.450\nYou'll see up here we've got like,\nwhoops, the bytes read and write.\n\n785\n00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:38.680\nAnd I don't normally care so much about\nthe amount of bytes that I'm reading and\n\n786\n00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.540\nwriting, some people do.\n\n787\n00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.810\nIf you're in database optimization,\nthose can matter.\n\n788\n00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:45.610\nBut usually, I'm just concerned about\nhow much we're moving per second, right?\n\n789\n00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:48.825\nAnd what that speed is, cuz I wanna\nknow if I'm getting disk latency, right?\n\n790\n00:36:48.825 --> 00:36:49.880\nIf things are just going slow there.\n\n791\n00:36:51.002 --> 00:36:54.410\nAll right, and so those are some\nof the things we need to catch.\n\n792\n00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.400\nRight there, what we're looking for,\nour reads and writes.\n\n793\n00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.350\nWe want those values be\nbelow like 20 milliseconds.\n\n794\n00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:02.070\nYou want to be able to get in and get out\nof your disk in less than 20 milliseconds.\n\n795\n00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.370\nAnd on magnetic media,\nthat's normally pretty easy.\n\n796\n00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:06.670\nOn SSD,\nit should be below like five milliseconds,\n\n797\n00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:07.900\nit should be significantly lower.\n\n798\n00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.536\nYou can get in and get out.\n\n799\n00:37:09.536 --> 00:37:11.740\nSSD's writes are normally\na little slower than reads,\n\n800\n00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.020\nI think I showed that in another episode.\n\n801\n00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.820\nBut it's still something we need to\nmonitor and kinda keep an eye on,\n\n802\n00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.410\nmake sure we've got that performance.\n\n803\n00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:23.230\nAlso, you gotta remember there's a number\nof different things that can cause these\n\n804\n00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.350\nproblems, which I'll talk\nabout in the next episode.\n\n805\n00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:30.090\nThat the source of the problem\ncan be a number of things, but\n\n806\n00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:33.790\nthe metric that shows us\nthe problem is this one right here.\n\n807\n00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:34.510\nAll right?\n\n808\n00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:35.580\nAnd then lastly, we've got network.\n\n809\n00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.880\nNetworks the only other thing that I\nhaven't grabbed yet, so let me go and\n\n810\n00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.050\nhunt down the network section.\n\n811\n00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:41.661\nAnd, under network.\n\n812\n00:37:42.728 --> 00:37:44.351\nWe can pull this up per adapter, and\n\n813\n00:37:44.351 --> 00:37:46.580\nthere's a lot of good\ninformation per adapter.\n\n814\n00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.380\nAnd again,\nyou don't want to do your totals.\n\n815\n00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.270\nYou don't wanna average that.\n\n816\n00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.044\nYou want to monitor them individually, cuz\nyou may have one adapter pegged out, and\n\n817\n00:37:52.044 --> 00:37:54.925\nothers that are sitting there empty cuz\nyou configured load balancing wrong.\n\n818\n00:37:54.925 --> 00:37:55.655\nRight?\nYou would\n\n819\n00:37:55.655 --> 00:37:59.285\nnotice that if you were taking an average,\nyou gotta take them individually.\n\n820\n00:37:59.285 --> 00:38:02.095\nAnd on the network side,\nI like to look at just bytes received and\n\n821\n00:38:02.095 --> 00:38:04.875\nbytes sent, these guys right here.\n\n822\n00:38:04.875 --> 00:38:07.015\nAnd again, I'm gonna track that for\nall instances.\n\n823\n00:38:07.015 --> 00:38:08.465\nLook at all the adapters I have.\n\n824\n00:38:08.465 --> 00:38:11.094\nIf it were to average that together,\nthat would be worthless to me.\n\n825\n00:38:11.094 --> 00:38:14.074\nNow, there are a lot of adapters\nI don't care about in here,\n\n826\n00:38:14.074 --> 00:38:15.945\nlike Torito tunnels and which types,\n\n827\n00:38:15.945 --> 00:38:20.059\nsome isatap stuff that I don't necessarily\ncare about, so I might exclude those.\n\n828\n00:38:20.059 --> 00:38:24.118\nBut if I'm gonna be adding adapters in\nthe future, I'd rather have that data and\n\n829\n00:38:24.118 --> 00:38:26.937\njust ignore it then,\nto need it and not have it, right?\n\n830\n00:38:26.937 --> 00:38:30.410\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and come, and\nadd those bytes received and bytes sent.\n\n831\n00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:33.760\nNow, remember that bytes received is not\nsomething you really do a whole lot about.\n\n832\n00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.980\nThe data is coming in and that's it.\n\n833\n00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.960\nBut if you can't keep up with the data, if\nyou see you hit a plateau, then you know\n\n834\n00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.320\nyou don't have enough bandwidth to\nreceive the data you should be receiving.\n\n835\n00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.730\nAnd on the outbound, it's the same thing.\n\n836\n00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:45.440\nWe're just kinda looking for\n\n837\n00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.337\nthat plateau where we exceed the amount of\nbandwidth that we've got available, right?\n\n838\n00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:54.010\nThat right there, this collection\nof counters, gives me my big four.\n\n839\n00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:59.700\nIt gives me my CPU,\nmemory, network and RAM.\n\n840\n00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.250\nShoot, I said that wrong.\n\n841\n00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:06.217\nDisk, network, CPU, RAM.\n\n842\n00:39:06.217 --> 00:39:07.157\nWhatever, the big four.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n843\n00:39:07.157 --> 00:39:08.810\n>> These things are on my screen\nright here that I just can't read.\n\n844\n00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:11.000\nSo, it gives me those big four.\n\n845\n00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.940\nAnd I'm viewing all of this from\nthe perspective of the hosts, right?\n\n846\n00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.360\nThe hosts and everything that it does.\n\n847\n00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.810\nI might take these same exact counters and\nput them inside of a VM to monitor and\n\n848\n00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:24.720\nget the view from the guest\noperating system, too.\n\n849\n00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.490\nAnd now I can see what it's doing, right?\n\n850\n00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:29.278\nAnd West is giving me the evil eye\ncuz we're like, way out of time, but\n\n851\n00:39:29.278 --> 00:39:31.280\nI just finished getting\nthese counters in place.\n\n852\n00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.182\nThe next thing that I need to do is,\nI need to take the actual base line, okay?\n\n853\n00:39:34.182 --> 00:39:39.139\nSo, if I take all that, I'm just gonna go\nahead in here and just say, okay to that.\n\n854\n00:39:39.139 --> 00:39:43.330\nAll right, so now I've got this nice\nlittle data collector set created,\n\n855\n00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.120\nthat's got the information that I want,\nokay?\n\n856\n00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:51.355\nNow, I wait for a time when my servers are\nrunning normal and I collect this data.\n\n857\n00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:55.639\nNow, be aware, your company is gonna\nhave peaks and valleys, right?\n\n858\n00:39:55.639 --> 00:39:58.608\nYou might be really busy at 8:00 AM.\n\n859\n00:39:58.608 --> 00:40:00.986\nAnd then by 10 AM things get slow.\n\n860\n00:40:00.986 --> 00:40:01.918\nAnd then people go to lunch.\n\n861\n00:40:01.918 --> 00:40:02.943\nIt gets really slow.\n\n862\n00:40:02.943 --> 00:40:06.000\nAnd then at 1 PM people come back from\nlunch and it gets really busy again.\n\n863\n00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.958\nAnd then it tapers off around 4\no'clock when people start getting\n\n864\n00:40:08.958 --> 00:40:09.590\nready to go home.\n\n865\n00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:11.940\nAnd then overnight it seats\nthere doing nothing, right?\n\n866\n00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.700\nAnd then maybe back up run at midnight.\n\n867\n00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.350\nThings are getting really busy again.\n\n868\n00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:17.120\nSo you have this peaks and valleys.\n\n869\n00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:21.540\nSo when you collect this baseline,\nit's a good idea to either one,\n\n870\n00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:27.770\ncollect it at peak time or two,\ncollect it over a period of time, right?\n\n871\n00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:32.140\nAnd so, what I can do is I can come in and\nI can take this data collector set, and\n\n872\n00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.070\nsee how you can start it?\n\n873\n00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:35.740\nI can just start it up and\nit will start collecting right now.\n\n874\n00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.690\nAnd I can leave it collecting for\na long period of time.\n\n875\n00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.560\nWe can come back tomorrow and get it.\n\n876\n00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.790\nAnd I think I showed you guys earlier\nwhere we could schedule this stuff.\n\n877\n00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:45.780\nAnd so I can come in here and\nI could schedule it.\n\n878\n00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:49.390\nAnd I could say, you know what,\nI want you to run, what is today?\n\n879\n00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:53.250\nToday is the 22nd, so\nI'll say I want you to run tomorrow and\n\n880\n00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:56.372\nI want you to start at 12 AM, right.\n\n881\n00:40:56.372 --> 00:40:59.090\nSo to start up at 12 AM and\nget running, and\n\n882\n00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:04.490\nI want you to run until tomorrow,\nwell, the next day.\n\n883\n00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:05.676\nLet do the 24th.\n\n884\n00:41:05.676 --> 00:41:06.260\nThere we go!\nSo\n\n885\n00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:10.710\nstart at the 23rd at 12 AM and\nthen expire on the 24th and stop, okay.\n\n886\n00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:13.246\nSo it'll run for 24 hours and it'll stop.\n\n887\n00:41:13.246 --> 00:41:17.220\nAnd now I'm gonna view of the whole\nday and if somebody says,\n\n888\n00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.750\nhey, it's 1 PM and the server is\nrunning slow,I can grab this baseline.\n\n889\n00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:24.720\nI can look at 1 PM, and\nI can see how things are running at 1 PM,\n\n890\n00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.190\nand then I can grab the baseline for\nnow and compare the two and\n\n891\n00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.800\nget an idea of how that's going to be,\nright?\n\n892\n00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.550\nAnd so that's what's the nice\npart about coming in and\n\n893\n00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.865\nscheduling these things to start them and\nstop them.\n\n894\n00:41:35.865 --> 00:41:38.565\nAnd you can even say,\nI wanna start it at 1 PM and\n\n895\n00:41:38.565 --> 00:41:41.965\nthen here in the stop condition I can\nsay just stop after an hour, right.\n\n896\n00:41:41.965 --> 00:41:43.825\nSo any time I set one of\nthese I can come in and\n\n897\n00:41:43.825 --> 00:41:47.195\njust say after one hour I wanna\nstop that collecting and that's it.\n\n898\n00:41:47.195 --> 00:41:48.595\nNow I don't even have to\nset an expiration time.\n\n899\n00:41:48.595 --> 00:41:50.132\nWe just start it and let it run, right.\n\n900\n00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:55.270\nSo once that's in place, now we can go and\ncollect this data whenever we want.\n\n901\n00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:58.150\nAnd all we have to do is come in here and\nstart it.\n\n902\n00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:01.350\nAnd now it's running in the background,\nand it's collecting all that data for me.\n\n903\n00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:04.080\nAnd it's gonna collect it until I stop it.\n\n904\n00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:09.370\nAnd when I stop it, now I've got the raw\nnumbers I can use to compare, okay.\n\n905\n00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:12.970\nAnd this is the last part I wanna show you\nis the actual baseline that I'm making.\n\n906\n00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.490\nSo this is running and\nit's collecting data.\n\n907\n00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:18.060\nAll right, now I'm not gonna let it\ncollect a whole lot of data cuz I'm just\n\n908\n00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.520\ngonna stop it here.\n\n909\n00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.840\nBut once it's collected, I can go back up\nto my performance monitor the screen I\n\n910\n00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.902\nshowed you guys earlier where it's just\nshowing me the real time data, and\n\n911\n00:42:27.902 --> 00:42:31.468\ninstead of showing real time data\nyou can tell it to view log data.\n\n912\n00:42:31.468 --> 00:42:35.802\nAnd I can come in here and I can add\nthat file that we just made, right.\n\n913\n00:42:35.802 --> 00:42:38.260\nThat little performance\nbaseline that I just made.\n\n914\n00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:45.330\nWe can add that in, and it's gonna ask me\nthe data that I want all the counters,\n\n915\n00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:49.880\nand I can come in here and I can say add,\nand I can just add, add in everything.\n\n916\n00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:55.110\nSo, I thought there was like\na super convenient Add All button.\n\n917\n00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:56.290\nApparently I'm wrong.\n\n918\n00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:01.530\nSo anyhow you can come through and\nyou can add in all this stuff, all these\n\n919\n00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.490\ncounters that we just did a minute ago,\nand so I'm just gonna come in here and\n\n920\n00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:08.010\nadd all these in; it's not that bad for\nme to do by hand.\n\n921\n00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:14.040\nPhysical disk system, and\nI'm leaving somebody off, right?\n\n922\n00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:14.670\nProcess here.\n\n923\n00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:16.900\nGot that one in.\n\n924\n00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.840\nSo I can add all these guys in,\nthere's all that data.\n\n925\n00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.650\nOn the general side, not general side,\nsource side, I can specify a time range.\n\n926\n00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:26.500\nSo if I'm troubleshooting for 1 PM I\ncan come in here and filter it to 1 PM,\n\n927\n00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.490\nsay show me that 1 PM.\n\n928\n00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.570\nAnd then I can say OK, and here's my data.\n\n929\n00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:34.420\nAnd I usually like to switch to\nthe report view, right here,\n\n930\n00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.560\nand it gives me all my averages.\n\n931\n00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.045\nSo during this baseline my average\npage reads per second was 0.05.\n\n932\n00:43:41.045 --> 00:43:44.190\nMy average writes per second was 0.000.\n\n933\n00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:45.970\nSomehow, I didn't write\nany data during that time.\n\n934\n00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:47.210\nIt's pretty amazing.\n\n935\n00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:48.740\nMy inputs, my outputs, and so on.\n\n936\n00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.970\nI can see all this data, and\n\n937\n00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:55.110\nnow when I have a problem, I run\nthe same report, I get the same data,\n\n938\n00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:57.770\nand I compare the two together and\nI look for a difference, right?\n\n939\n00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:59.530\nIt makes life so much easier.\n\n940\n00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:00.710\nThis becomes my baseline.\n\n941\n00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:01.250\nI file this away.\n\n942\n00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:02.320\nI print it out.\nStick it on my wall.\n\n943\n00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:02.967\nFrame it, right?\n\n944\n00:44:02.967 --> 00:44:03.820\nThis is my baseline.\n\n945\n00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.890\nThis is what things are like\nwhen it should be good.\n\n946\n00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:08.930\nAnd then anytime somebody complains or\nwe suspect a problem or\n\n947\n00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:13.720\nwhatever, it's just a simple comparison,\nnumbers to numbers, really easy to tell.\n\n948\n00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.200\n>> Good information, I'll keep in mind.\n\n949\n00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.810\nIn this episode,\nwe've showed you how to make a baseline.\n\n950\n00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:22.800\nBut, regardless of what we've shown you,\nremember the best practice is always\n\n951\n00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:26.920\nstart with the manufacturer, so you know\nwhat it is that you should be monitoring.\n\n952\n00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.980\nGreat information, Don there.\n\n953\n00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.270\nAnything else you'd like to add?\n\n954\n00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:33.270\n>> Definitely stay tuned for part two,\ncuz we just showed how to make a baseline.\n\n955\n00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:34.800\nWe haven't actually used it, right?\n\n956\n00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.350\nAnd so I wanna go through later in our\nnext part, and kinda highlight some of\n\n957\n00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:42.650\nthe problems you can have, right,\nand how we would identify those.\n\n958\n00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:45.200\nAnd some of the techniques we've\ngot to remediate and optimize,\n\n959\n00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.240\nhow we can kinda get over those\nlimitations that we've got.\n\n960\n00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.480\nSo we'll get a chance to see that.\n\n961\n00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.580\nYeah, really in the next part.\n\n962\n00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.300\n>> All right, very good.\n\n963\n00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.350\nLook forward to seeing that so\n\n964\n00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:56.010\nstick around cuz we're coming\nback at you with a part two.\n\n965\n00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:58.430\nBut it looks like we've come\nto the end of another episode.\n\n966\n00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:01.780\nSo signing off here for ITPROTV,\nI've been your host Wes Brian.\n\n967\n00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:02.570\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n968\n00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:07.134\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n969\n00:45:07.134 --> 00:45:11.510\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.180\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.110\nAnd in today's episode, we're gonna be\nmoving along in our Cloud+ series and\n\n5\n00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.110\nwe're coming back at you with,\nbelieve it or\n\n6\n00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.940\nnot, a part two for\noptimizing performance.\n\n7\n00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.550\nAnd we've got Don Pezet here\nto help us out with that.\n\n8\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.880\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.990\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.980\nReady to jump right back into\noptimizing our virtual environment.\n\n11\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.550\nIn the last episode,\nwe talked about making a base line and\n\n12\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.910\ncollecting data about our\nsystem while it was healthy.\n\n13\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.980\nAnd what I wanna do now is kind of,\nswitch gears and\n\n14\n00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.080\nsay, what if things aren't healthy?\n\n15\n00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.620\nWhat if I get a call from out in the field\nand somebody says, the servers are slow,\n\n16\n00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.690\nor the system is slow.\n\n17\n00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.570\nAnd so I rerun my baseline and I compare\nthe numbers like we talked about in\n\n18\n00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.650\nthe last episode, and\nI see they're different.\n\n19\n00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.760\nWell what then?\n\n20\n00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.470\nWhat do you do?\n\n21\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.460\nWell, if they got better,\nyou just kick your feet up on the desk and\n\n22\n00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.803\nsay job well done, right?\n\n23\n00:01:01.803 --> 00:01:04.462\nSo, usually that means\nsomething's offline.\n\n24\n00:01:04.462 --> 00:01:08.460\n[LAUGH] But if things are worse we\nknow we've gotta take action, and\n\n25\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.230\nwhat's that action going to be?\n\n26\n00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.690\nWell, in real life LAN there's a simple\nanswer which is you can throw money at\n\n27\n00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.700\nany problem.\n\n28\n00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.850\nSo, if you've got CPUs that are running\nslow, you can buy new, faster CPUs.\n\n29\n00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.420\nIf you're out of RAM,\nyou can buy more RAM.\n\n30\n00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.180\nIf you're disk IO is throttled out, it's\nmaxed out, you can buy more disks, right.\n\n31\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.470\nMoney will solve all IT\nproblems eventually.\n\n32\n00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.290\nBut, we don't always have money, right?\n\n33\n00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.600\nWe don't always have that budget.\n\n34\n00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.450\nAnd sometimes it's not a matter of\nneeding to buy more equipment, but\n\n35\n00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.050\ntuning the equipment we already have.\n\n36\n00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.170\nYou may be able to take\nwhat you've already got and\n\n37\n00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.490\nmake it work a little bit better, and\neke some extra performance out of it.\n\n38\n00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.770\nBefore you have to resort to buying more.\n\n39\n00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.080\nAnd remember when you buy more,\nthere's scaling up, or vertically,\n\n40\n00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.550\nand there's scaling out, or horizontally.\n\n41\n00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.510\nSo, I might be scaling up which\nmeans add more CPUs, add more RAM,\n\n42\n00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.480\nadd more disks to one server.\n\n43\n00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.840\nOr I might be scaling out, which is adding\nmore servers and distributing my virtual\n\n44\n00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.170\nload across those servers in a more even\nfashion to improve performance, right?\n\n45\n00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.310\nThey're both great solutions.\n\n46\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.590\nThey work as long term solutions.\n\n47\n00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.460\nBut short term we do need to\ntune what we've already got.\n\n48\n00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.330\nSo let's start with disk.\n\n49\n00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.940\nIn the last episode I said it was\nreally important to monitor our disk\n\n50\n00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.770\nreads per second and\n\n51\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.690\nour disk writes per second to get\nan idea of how our system is performing.\n\n52\n00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.525\nAnd that's important because when\nyou start running this stuff,\n\n53\n00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:31.765\nwe need to make sure that we're getting\nthe best performance possible and\n\n54\n00:02:31.765 --> 00:02:33.485\nthat we're not hitting a threshold.\n\n55\n00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:35.105\nHitting kind of a limit, right?\n\n56\n00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:36.395\nI wanna show you that process.\n\n57\n00:02:36.395 --> 00:02:38.735\nI want to monitor a disk and\nshow you a way we can tune or\n\n58\n00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:40.555\ntweak our disk to get performance.\n\n59\n00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:43.365\nNow, when it comes to disk, there's\ntwo failures that are really common.\n\n60\n00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:48.310\nThe disk drive itself fails or the HBA,\n\n61\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.870\nthe Host Bus Adaptor, fails,\nthe connection to the storage.\n\n62\n00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.600\nHBA adaptor failures are really easy\nto spot, because they disappear.\n\n63\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.000\nAnd when they disappear,\nyour storage disappears.\n\n64\n00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.190\nAnd so\nif all of a sudden your drives are gone,\n\n65\n00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.760\nyou may be dealing with an HBA failure,\nright?\n\n66\n00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.800\nSo really easy to spot those.\n\n67\n00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.170\nThat's not a big deal.\n\n68\n00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.950\nBut disk failure,\nthat one's harder to spot.\n\n69\n00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.620\nA disk failure is hard to spot because\nmost of us have been pulling this on\n\n70\n00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.030\na redundant array.\n\n71\n00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.580\nSo if a drive fails the redundant\narray keeps the array online.\n\n72\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.700\nBut what happens is, if it's like RAID 5,\n\n73\n00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.990\nwe talked about RAID 5\nin an earlier episode.\n\n74\n00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.080\nIf one disk fails we've got parody\nblocks that allow us to reconstruct\n\n75\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.350\nthe missing data.\n\n76\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.620\nBut now, every time we read, it's\nhaving to do a mathematical operation.\n\n77\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.910\nSo the amount of reads we can\nperform per second goes down.\n\n78\n00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.880\nWe can only do fewer reads because of\nthe mathematics that has to occur.\n\n79\n00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.090\nAnd so a disk might fail.\n\n80\n00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.230\nI don't see the storage go offline, but I\ndo see my performance start to take a hit.\n\n81\n00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.650\nAnd if that's the case the solution\nis to replace the missing drive.\n\n82\n00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.420\nBut even on regular drives,\nwhen they're up and\n\n83\n00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.940\nhealthy, you might just have more\ndisk activity going on than normal.\n\n84\n00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.570\nAnd we can change the arrangement.\n\n85\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.326\nWhen we talked about RAID 5,\nwe talked other RAID to RAID technologies,\n\n86\n00:03:57.326 --> 00:03:59.310\nlike RAID 10 and even RAID 0.\n\n87\n00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.140\nWe're even get more\nperformance out of them.\n\n88\n00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.050\nAnd it may just be a matter of changing\nwhich form of RAID you're using on\n\n89\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.530\nyour storage controller to be able to\nget that better performance, right.\n\n90\n00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.910\nSo, let's take a look at disk here.\n\n91\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.380\nI'm in my performance counter\nhere on a Windows server.\n\n92\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.450\nAnd let me get rid of CPU which\nis what it monitors by default.\n\n93\n00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.220\nAnd I'm gonna add in my disk reads and\nwrites per second.\n\n94\n00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.950\nSo I'm gonna add in my physical disk and\nactually, let's do this.\n\n95\n00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.580\nLet me cancel that.\n\n96\n00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.880\nLet's get a disk first, right?\n\n97\n00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.780\nSo, I'm going to go into my\ncomputer management here and\n\n98\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.370\ntake a look at the disks that I have.\n\n99\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.280\nNow, I have on this computer two one\nterabyte drives that are identical, right.\n\n100\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.930\nSo that's these two drives\nthat are showing up\n\n101\n00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.600\nhere at the bottom of my screen.\n\n102\n00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.177\nThey show up as 931.5 gigs\nbecause that's what happens.\n\n103\n00:04:42.177 --> 00:04:46.330\n[LAUGH] It's cuz of the whole measurement\nof bits versus bytes and all that mess.\n\n104\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.710\nBut I'm just gonna whip up\na quick partition here, right?\n\n105\n00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.910\nSo I'll do a new simple volume and\nI'll just kinda go with the defaults here.\n\n106\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.960\nWe'll make it a terabyte in size,\nI'll give it drive letter D.\n\n107\n00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.410\nAnd I'll give it a name of how\nabout storage, that's a good name.\n\n108\n00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.012\nI'll do a quick format and\nwe'll drop it in place.\n\n109\n00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:06.610\nAll right.\nSo I'll have a one terabyte drive that's\n\n110\n00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.250\nlettered D.\n\n111\n00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.410\nAnd I wanna measure performance\non that disk, right?\n\n112\n00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.020\nSo, I'm gonna jump over to\nmy performance counter.\n\n113\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.310\nAnd I'm gonna add in my disk reads and\ndisk writes for that disk.\n\n114\n00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.571\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nfind my physical disk.\n\n115\n00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:25.751\nAnd I'm gonna take my disk reads and\ndisk writes.\n\n116\n00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:29.930\nHere we go, and\nwe're gonna add these guys in.\n\n117\n00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.466\nSo, I'm looking basically for my disk\nreads and I've got my bytes per second and\n\n118\n00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:34.767\nall that good stuff, right.\n\n119\n00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:37.870\nSo I'm just looking for\nall that information to get put in.\n\n120\n00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.630\nSo I can measure that out and\nsee what we're doing.\n\n121\n00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.280\nAll right, now, when I add this in\nI'm just gonna pick the D drive.\n\n122\n00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.001\nNormally I monitor everything, but here I\njust wanna get the D drive because I wanna\n\n123\n00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:49.086\nhave the smallest data set possible,\nright.\n\n124\n00:05:49.086 --> 00:05:54.120\nSo, I'll get my average disk queue\nlength also while I'm in here.\n\n125\n00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.660\nSo, I am in physical disk, right?\n\n126\n00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.950\nYou gonna make sure you do that.\n\n127\n00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.300\nIf you screw things up\nyou get weird numbers.\n\n128\n00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.552\nAll right.\nSo I'm going to add in that physical\n\n129\n00:06:00.552 --> 00:06:01.118\ndisk queue length.\n\n130\n00:06:01.118 --> 00:06:06.248\nAnd then I'm gonna do my\naverage disk seconds read and\n\n131\n00:06:06.248 --> 00:06:09.212\naverage disks seconds right.\n\n132\n00:06:09.212 --> 00:06:09.725\nOkay.\n\n133\n00:06:09.725 --> 00:06:11.280\nSo, I'm just adding those counters in.\n\n134\n00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.360\nI could go and just add those counters\ntoo if I wanted to gather that data.\n\n135\n00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.640\nIf I wanted to do just like our\nbytes read and write and so\n\n136\n00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.080\non to be able to measure that data.\n\n137\n00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.530\nBut I'm really concerned about time,\nlatency, right.\n\n138\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.273\nHow long this stuff is taking to write?\n\n139\n00:06:23.273 --> 00:06:25.710\nAll right, so, I'm gonna add that in.\n\n140\n00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.630\nThere we go.\nit's now monitoring it here on the system.\n\n141\n00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.190\nAnd I don't expect to see a whole heck of\na lot going on right now, cuz that disk I\n\n142\n00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.150\njust formatted it, it should be sitting\nthere idle, I expect to see it zeroed.\n\n143\n00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.585\nBut I wrote a little script before\nthe show that will generate some disk\n\n144\n00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:39.210\nI/O for me.\n\n145\n00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.340\nAnd so I'm gonna take that script,\nand I'm gonna copy it and\n\n146\n00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.458\ndrop it right on that D\ndrive that we just made.\n\n147\n00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:47.850\nAnd so, I'm gonna paste that in there,\nthe script is really small, so\n\n148\n00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.800\nit's gonna copy in.\n\n149\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.770\nThat might register, there we go.\n\n150\n00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.750\nSee how I got some activity there\nwhen I copied that script over?\n\n151\n00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.520\nAnd we should see that\ndrop back down again.\n\n152\n00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.140\nNow, that was my average disk queue\nlink that spiked up in the red.\n\n153\n00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.620\nAnd then I'll see some of the other guys,\n\n154\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.490\nwhere's that little highlight\ntool on this thing?\n\n155\n00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.480\n>> Should be a little\n\n156\n00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.280\nhighlighter marker there next to the-\n>> There we go.\n\n157\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.270\n>> There we go.\n>> All right.\n\n158\n00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.590\nSo there's my average disk queue\nlength when I went to write.\n\n159\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.180\nAnd you'll see it kinda spiked up.\n\n160\n00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.590\nDown here I can see my maximum was 4.1.\n\n161\n00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.090\nSo at one point I had four processes\nwaiting to write to that data disk\n\n162\n00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.220\nthat had to wait.\n\n163\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.340\nOr to read for that matter.\n\n164\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.300\nSo, I had a little bit of a back up.\n\n165\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.680\nNow four is not that high of a number.\n\n166\n00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.580\nI'm not to worried about that.\n\n167\n00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.290\nThat was a simple operation.\n\n168\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.260\nAnd then I can see my other data like\nmy average disk per second reads,\n\n169\n00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.940\nwere super low, zero.\n\n170\n00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.290\nWell, that's cuz I didn't read anything.\n\n171\n00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.040\nI pasted, I copied it, that was a right.\n\n172\n00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.135\nAnd if I look at my writes,\nthere we we go.\n\n173\n00:07:43.135 --> 00:07:44.615\nHere's my writes per second.\n\n174\n00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:47.396\nAnd I'll see my maximum there was 0.410.\n\n175\n00:07:47.396 --> 00:07:50.565\nAll right, now, I just wanna kinda\nremember these numbers right.\n\n176\n00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:51.955\nThis is kinda like my baseline.\n\n177\n00:07:51.955 --> 00:07:54.602\nHere's I'm writing data with\na single operation, and\n\n178\n00:07:54.602 --> 00:07:55.962\nthis is what I expect to see.\n\n179\n00:07:55.962 --> 00:07:59.629\nNow, if I start running my script, things\nare gonna go a little bit differently.\n\n180\n00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:00.629\nI'll show you what this script does.\n\n181\n00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:03.004\nIt's really pretty simple.\n\n182\n00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:09.758\nWhat it does is it just generates a file\nwith 10 megs of random data in it.\n\n183\n00:08:09.758 --> 00:08:12.530\nSo it's gonna generate this\nfile of 10 megs of random data,\n\n184\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.200\nand then it just starts copying that file.\n\n185\n00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.710\nNow, copy operations are neat, because\nyou've gotta read the source file and\n\n186\n00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.740\nthen write the copy.\n\n187\n00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.447\nSo it's gonna generate reads and\nwrites, and\n\n188\n00:08:21.447 --> 00:08:24.820\nit's just going to continue looping and\nlooping and looping until I stop it.\n\n189\n00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:25.670\nAnd what I'm gonna do,\n\n190\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:31.090\nis I'm gonna run four copies of this\nscript at once, because that's more fun.\n\n191\n00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.694\nSo let me run that script, and\nI'm gonna run it four times.\n\n192\n00:08:33.694 --> 00:08:34.790\nSo it's gonna be doing reads and\n\n193\n00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.520\nwrites there four times in\nthe background on that D drive.\n\n194\n00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.280\nAnd sure enough, in the background I start\nto see this spike in activity, right?\n\n195\n00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.150\nAnd now it's going and\nit's churning along, and\n\n196\n00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.830\nthose files are just gonna keep\nrunning until I stop them.\n\n197\n00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.970\nAnd if I look down here and\nstart kinda processing some of my data,\n\n198\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.010\nmy average disk queue length\nis starting to climb.\n\n199\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.265\nI can see my average disk queue\nlength right now is 14, right,\n\n200\n00:08:56.265 --> 00:08:57.420\nand starting to go up.\n\n201\n00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.630\nThere it goes to 16, my queue is\nstarting to get a little bigger and\n\n202\n00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.970\na little bigger as the system runs.\n\n203\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.310\nAnd as I look at my other data,\n\n204\n00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:10.658\nI can see here my average disk\nper second read, I'm at 0.889.\n\n205\n00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:14.480\nI was at 0.4 earlier,\nnow it's doubled in size.\n\n206\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.940\nAnd, again, I can monitor my other\ncounters and see the same information.\n\n207\n00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.033\nAnd what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna write\ndown here, just on a piece of paper,\n\n208\n00:09:21.033 --> 00:09:24.326\nthe numbers that I'm getting, because I\ndidn't take a good baseline before this.\n\n209\n00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:28.918\nSo, basically running it\nlike I'm doing right now,\n\n210\n00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:33.410\nI'm looking at around a,\n16.982 is my max for\n\n211\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:38.100\nmy queue length, so\nI'm just writing that down.\n\n212\n00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.590\nAnd then I'll take my read numbers,\n\n213\n00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.470\nwhich got a max of 0.889.\n\n214\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.832\nAnd if I wait long enough,\nI guess I could take my average, but\n\n215\n00:09:48.832 --> 00:09:50.160\nI'll run with the max on this one.\n\n216\n00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:57.402\nAnd then on my write\nnumbers I had a 0.920.\n\n217\n00:09:57.402 --> 00:09:59.465\nOkay, now why am I writing those down?\n\n218\n00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:01.545\nWell, I'm writing them down because,\nfirst off,\n\n219\n00:10:01.545 --> 00:10:03.072\nI need to remember them, so there's that.\n\n220\n00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:07.805\n[LAUGH] Secondly, because this is now\ngonna be considered my good baseline.\n\n221\n00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:09.885\nThis is the system when it's running well.\n\n222\n00:10:09.885 --> 00:10:12.355\nIf things are running properly,\nthis is good enough for me, and\n\n223\n00:10:12.355 --> 00:10:15.045\nthis is what I'm gonna act on, okay?\n\n224\n00:10:15.045 --> 00:10:19.290\nBut, what if I make a change to\nthe system trying to improve performance?\n\n225\n00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.410\nHow do I know it worked?\n\n226\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.810\nHow do I know I actually\nimproved performance?\n\n227\n00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.690\nWell, I don't, necessarily, right?\n\n228\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.230\nI don't unless I have\na way to measure that.\n\n229\n00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.050\nAnd so what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna take that and stop right there.\n\n230\n00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.330\nSo I just killed my script, and so\n\n231\n00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.110\nI should see all those\nthings kinda drop off.\n\n232\n00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:40.430\nThat was a single, 1 TB hard drive,\nand it was a spinning disk.\n\n233\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.329\nSo I had one arm that was able to move,\nand read, and write, and\n\n234\n00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:46.771\nall that stuff from one place at a time.\n\n235\n00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:49.165\nAnd that's how it works, that's why\nmy queue length had to go up so far.\n\n236\n00:10:49.165 --> 00:10:50.383\nBecause the read and writes,\n\n237\n00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:52.730\nhaving to move that arm and\ndoing one operation at a time.\n\n238\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.870\nWhat if I were to take those disks and\ncombine them into a stripe?\n\n239\n00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.770\nIf I had two disks striped, now I would\nhave two arms doing the reads and writes,\n\n240\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.660\nand I would expect to see\na performance increase.\n\n241\n00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.699\nRight, you expect to see\na performance increase, but\n\n242\n00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:11.180\nthere are times where having a stripe\ndoesn't improve your performance.\n\n243\n00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.710\nRemember, when you define a stripe,\nthere's a stripe size.\n\n244\n00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.390\nLet's say my stripe size is 64 KB.\n\n245\n00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:22.360\nSo, for every 64 KB of data,\nI break it apart across different disks.\n\n246\n00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.500\nWell, what if my file\nwas under 64 KB in size?\n\n247\n00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.420\nIt's not big enough to hit the stripe\nlimit, and it's not gonna stripe.\n\n248\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.170\nIt's only gonna write to one disk,\nI won't see any performance gain.\n\n249\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.878\nDon't assume that you always get\na performance gain with technologies.\n\n250\n00:11:36.878 --> 00:11:39.576\nYou've got to really understand\nthe underlying technology to know\n\n251\n00:11:39.576 --> 00:11:41.097\nif you're truly gonna get that gain.\n\n252\n00:11:41.097 --> 00:11:42.935\nAnd measuring a baseline like this, and\n\n253\n00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:45.530\nthen comparing it to\na performance gain will.\n\n254\n00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.410\nNow, the file that I'm copying is 10 megs,\nit's gonna be bigger than a stripe size.\n\n255\n00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.200\nBut, if you're doing document imaging,\n\n256\n00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.870\nyou may have millions of files\nthat are under 4K in size,\n\n257\n00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.510\nand now, you need to make your stripe\nsmall enough to accommodate for that.\n\n258\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.744\nYou need to tune your disk\nsubsystem to account for\n\n259\n00:12:01.744 --> 00:12:03.980\nthe type of data you're storing.\n\n260\n00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.928\nAnd many, many people forget to do that,\n\n261\n00:12:05.928 --> 00:12:08.390\nit's a big fault you see in\na lot of IT environments.\n\n262\n00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.510\n>> And an example of that, Don, would\nprobably be going into the BIOS, and when\n\n263\n00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.800\nyou're creating that RAID array, obviously\na little bit of preparation here.\n\n264\n00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.820\nYou gotta know what it is that that RAID\narray is supporting, and then you would\n\n265\n00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.590\njust reduce the block size down to\nwhatever the efficient parameter might be.\n\n266\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.940\n>> Absolutely, that's it.\n\n267\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.684\nAnd usually they'll pick a bigger size for\n\n268\n00:12:24.684 --> 00:12:27.890\nthe stripe cuz it's less math on their\npart, it's kinda easier to divide up.\n\n269\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.490\nBut you may need a smaller stripe size.\n\n270\n00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.370\nAnd I know I've talked to\npeople where they've said,\n\n271\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.120\nI always wondered why\nthat setting is there.\n\n272\n00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.030\nWell, that's why.\n\n273\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.210\nIf you're dealing with a lot\nof small files, you need it.\n\n274\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.503\nAlso the way you format your disk,\nright, like if you're running Linux on\n\n275\n00:12:40.503 --> 00:12:44.160\ntop of RAID, with Linux they're really\nparticular about your inode-size.\n\n276\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.950\nAnd if you got a 4K inode-size and\nyour stripe is smaller than 4K,\n\n277\n00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.090\nthat can cause problems.\n\n278\n00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.510\nNow one inode is getting\nbroken up all over the place.\n\n279\n00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.770\nAnd so you'd want to make sure your stripe\nwas at least the size as your disk inodes.\n\n280\n00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.820\nIt all comes down to your operating system\nand reading your performance manuals for\n\n281\n00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.050\nyour operating system,\nit all does make a difference.\n\n282\n00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.720\nBut, let's change these disks now.\n\n283\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.550\nSo, when I was in my computer management,\n\n284\n00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.030\nI showed you guys how I had this D drive,\nright?\n\n285\n00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.610\nAnd, on my D drive,\nit's just a single 1 TB disk, but\n\n286\n00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:14.420\nI've got two of those TB disks sitting\nhere, right, I'm not really using them.\n\n287\n00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.610\nSo, I wanna create a mirror.\n\n288\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.710\nNow, I could do a software mirror,\nI'm sorry, I don't want a mirror.\n\n289\n00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.960\nMirrors don't help performance, right?\n\n290\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.170\nYou just read and write from one disk.\n\n291\n00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.080\nI want a stripe.\n\n292\n00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.860\nStripes is where I get performance.\n\n293\n00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.600\nWell I can do a software stripe in\nWindows, but software stripes stink, and\n\n294\n00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.430\nyou get a lot of performance\noverhead just from being software.\n\n295\n00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.738\nSo I'm gonna do this in hardware.\n\n296\n00:13:31.738 --> 00:13:33.131\nSo let me delete that volume.\n\n297\n00:13:34.536 --> 00:13:37.740\nOr, actually, hang on, before I do that,\nlet me back up my script.\n\n298\n00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.760\nI don't want to lose my\nscript that we just made.\n\n299\n00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.962\nSo let me just copy that to my desktop.\n\n300\n00:13:42.962 --> 00:13:44.436\n>> And while Don's doing that,\n\n301\n00:13:44.436 --> 00:13:47.910\none of the things to keep in mind,\nremember CPU acceleration.\n\n302\n00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.688\nThat's what we're talking, we say\nsoftware accelieration, acceleration,\n\n303\n00:13:51.688 --> 00:13:52.640\nif I can even say it.\n\n304\n00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.888\nThat's software assisted means you're\nrobbing everything else in the system of\n\n305\n00:13:56.888 --> 00:14:00.886\nthe CPU cycles that could be used in\nthe CPU, versus hardware acceleration,\n\n306\n00:14:00.886 --> 00:14:02.580\nthat hardware based rate.\n\n307\n00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.120\nNow we've got a dedicated\n\n308\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.340\npiece of hardware that's performing all\nthat functionality that keeps performance\n\n309\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.610\nlevels where they need to be\n>> All right, so\n\n310\n00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.960\nI'm gonna delete these volumes.\n\n311\n00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.050\nSo now, there we go,\nI've got my two empty 1 TB drives.\n\n312\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.970\nAnd then, Wes mentioned rebooting and\ngoing into the RAID controller.\n\n313\n00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:18.880\nSometimes you have to do that.\n\n314\n00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.980\nSometimes, if you have the RAID\ncontroller software loaded,\n\n315\n00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.780\nyou can actually just do it right from the\nsoftware, and that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n316\n00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.710\nThis is an Intel Express RAID controller,\nand so\n\n317\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:31.050\nI can actually go in here and\ncreate that stripe on the fly.\n\n318\n00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:35.820\nSo it sees the disk, there's my\nmirrored operating system disks, and\n\n319\n00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.810\nhere's those two 1 TB drives\nsitting there doing nothing.\n\n320\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.087\nAnd so I'm just gonna go in here and\ncreate a new disk.\n\n321\n00:14:42.087 --> 00:14:47.103\nAnd it sees that it's a SATA disk, and\nI can pick between RAID 1 or RAID 0.\n\n322\n00:14:47.103 --> 00:14:50.390\nI don't have RAID 5 or anything as an\noption cuz I've only got two empty disks.\n\n323\n00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.310\nIf I had more, I'd see RAID 5, or RAID 10,\nor whatever for the disks that I had.\n\n324\n00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.180\nBut I want to do RAID 0.\n\n325\n00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.215\nAnd over here it's telling me that I'm\ngonna be getting performance striping,\n\n326\n00:14:58.215 --> 00:15:01.230\nright, versus RAID 1,\nwhich would be mirroring.\n\n327\n00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:05.410\nAnd now I don't get performance,\nbut I get protection, right?\n\n328\n00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.730\nRAID 0, no protection, great performance.\n\n329\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.620\nSo that's part of that whole\nchoice of which one we want to do.\n\n330\n00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.730\nSo I'm gonna do performance\noptimized RAID,\n\n331\n00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.903\nI'm gonna pick those two\ndisks that I've got.\n\n332\n00:15:15.903 --> 00:15:19.278\nAnd then right down here,\nI've got my volume size that I can pick,\n\n333\n00:15:19.278 --> 00:15:20.570\nI'm gonna do 100%.\n\n334\n00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.936\nSo it was a terabyte drive before,\nI don't have to do 100%.\n\n335\n00:15:23.936 --> 00:15:28.291\nI could drop it to 50 so that I end up\nwith a drive that's the exact same size as\n\n336\n00:15:28.291 --> 00:15:31.150\nwhat it was before, but\nonly striping on half.\n\n337\n00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.670\nBut I'll do the whole thing.\n\n338\n00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:37.360\nAnd under Advanced, here's my data\nstripe size, and there's that 16 KB.\n\n339\n00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.690\nIf I've got a lot of 16 KB files,\nis that gonna help me?\n\n340\n00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.764\nNo, and I can drop it down to 4 KB.\n\n341\n00:15:42.764 --> 00:15:45.700\nAnd see, they don't even go\nbelow 4 KB here, which is\n\n342\n00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.140\nprobably because of the whole inode-size\nthing that I was mentioning earlier.\n\n343\n00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.770\nSo I don't even have to\nworry about it on this one.\n\n344\n00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.030\nOn your RAID controller,\nyou might have to.\n\n345\n00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.602\nI'm dealing with 10 megs of data, so\n\n346\n00:15:53.602 --> 00:15:55.605\nI could actually go up 128 KB stripes and\nbe okay.\n\n347\n00:15:55.605 --> 00:15:58.850\nBut I'm gonna leave mine at\nthe default and just leave it there.\n\n348\n00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.297\nNow, notice here, I've got this\nenable volume write-back cache.\n\n349\n00:16:02.297 --> 00:16:04.504\nMy rate controller's cheap,\nso I don't have one.\n\n350\n00:16:04.504 --> 00:16:07.373\nBut if you use better\ncomponents than I do,\n\n351\n00:16:07.373 --> 00:16:12.910\nthen you'll have a battery back write\ncache controller, I can't even say it.\n\n352\n00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:13.990\nIt does two things.\n\n353\n00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.410\nFirst off if you lose power,\n\n354\n00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.100\nit saves whatever you were writing at the\ntime you lost power and it will write it\n\n355\n00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.360\nas soon as the system comes back up\nagain as a battery that keeps that.\n\n356\n00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.650\nThe second thing is, if you're writing\nfaster than your disk can write,\n\n357\n00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.600\nit will actually queue stuff up to\nactually save it there instead of saving\n\n358\n00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.300\nit in the operating system.\n\n359\n00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.680\nThe operating systems can move on and\n\n360\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.870\ndo other things and the rate control can\nwrite it when it has some down time.\n\n361\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.450\nIt's pros and cons so that but\nit's usually a good thing.\n\n362\n00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.010\nI don't have it so it doesn't matter.\n\n363\n00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.500\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and create that.\n\n364\n00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.750\nAnd that's gonna create a striped drive\nacross those two disks, all right?\n\n365\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.830\nAnd so I'm gonna give it\na second while it builds that.\n\n366\n00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.440\nAnd as soon as it builds that,\nthere we go.\n\n367\n00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.520\nNow I've got a new drive in my system.\n\n368\n00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.800\nAnd if I go back to my computer\nmanagement, all right,\n\n369\n00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.730\nI can see that I've got this unknown disk\nthat's almost two terabytes in size.\n\n370\n00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:01.840\nThat's that stripe that we just made.\n\n371\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.830\nSo I'm gonna initialize that.\n\n372\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.150\nAnd bring it online, and\nI'll create a new volume.\n\n373\n00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.830\nAnd I'll do the same thing I did before.\n\n374\n00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:11.750\nI'm gonna create a D Drive,\nI'm just gonna call it Storage.\n\n375\n00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.263\nAnd I'm gonna get that in place.\n\n376\n00:17:16.263 --> 00:17:19.150\nAnd so now, I'll have that D drive again.\n\n377\n00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:26.110\nEventually, and actually one thing I will\nneed to do is let me go back here, I'm\n\n378\n00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:29.860\ngonna clear out these counters, because\nthe performance counters are attached to\n\n379\n00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.060\nthat old D-drive which now has a different\nID, so I just need to change that.\n\n380\n00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.280\nAnd it should have formatted it already,\nwhat is it doing?\n\n381\n00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.080\n>> It's thinking about it.\n\n382\n00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.525\n>> I know,\nit's getting really angry at me.\n\n383\n00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:41.510\n[LAUGH] But\nas soon as it's done not responding,\n\n384\n00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.690\nthen it'll make that volume and format.\n\n385\n00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.560\nI can throw my script on there and\nwe can measure the speeds again and\n\n386\n00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.830\nsee how is it doing?\n\n387\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.470\nAm I getting that performance\nout of it that I need to get\n\n388\n00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.640\nto get it up and running?\n\n389\n00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.220\nAnd now I'll have a better picture\nof whether I actually gained\n\n390\n00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:55.790\nperformance, right.\n\n391\n00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.000\nRemember our metrics from before that I\nhad recorded where it said I had a maximum\n\n392\n00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.980\nq length of 16 when I was running\nthose scripts earlier and my read and\n\n393\n00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.430\nwrite maximums were 0.8 and\n0.9 respectively.\n\n394\n00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.990\nI can look and see am I actually\ngetting anything out of that, right?\n\n395\n00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.930\nSo here's my new d drive.\n\n396\n00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:16.170\nAnd let me just copy my script over to it,\nwhich I have sitting on my desktop.\n\n397\n00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.210\nAnd actually I've got\nsome junk files in here.\n\n398\n00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.370\nLet me delete those out real quick.\n\n399\n00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.660\nIt's all those filler files that we were\nmaking as part of the script running.\n\n400\n00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.130\nAnd so let me just take that,\n\n401\n00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:30.500\nand I'm gonna send that over\nto my newly minted D drive.\n\n402\n00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.650\nThere it is.\n\n403\n00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.260\nAnd I'm gonna go back to my performance\nmonitor and add those counters back in.\n\n404\n00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.590\nI'm having to add them in again.\n\n405\n00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.660\nIt's still drive letter D, which is great.\n\n406\n00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.730\nBut Windows actually keeps a unique\nidentifier for each drive and\n\n407\n00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:43.590\nthe identifiers change.\n\n408\n00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:44.870\nSo I've gotta readd it in.\n\n409\n00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.840\nIf I was monitoring all of the instances\nof my disks then it would have grabbed it\n\n410\n00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.220\nbut I was being very specific so.\n\n411\n00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.789\nLet me get back in here and\nI'm gonna go look for that disk Q length.\n\n412\n00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.540\nWhich was my average disk queue length.\n\n413\n00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.560\nWhoops, and I'm forgetting to do\nthe one thing I said I wanted to do,\n\n414\n00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.260\nwhich was just to get the D drive.\n\n415\n00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:09.830\nAnd then I'm gonna go in and\nget the disk reads, the seconds per read,\n\n416\n00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.100\nthe latency, and then the write latency.\n\n417\n00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.250\nThere we go.\n\n418\n00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.360\nAll right, so I've got those in, and\n\n419\n00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.070\nnow I'm measuring the same\nthings that I measured before.\n\n420\n00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:22.310\nI'm gonna go and run that same script that\nI ran before to generate that activity.\n\n421\n00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.630\nAnd there it goes.\n\n422\n00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:28.190\nAnd I can start to see, I get that spike,\nand now things are happening.\n\n423\n00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:32.370\nThe difference is instead of writing to\none disk, I'm now writing to two, and\n\n424\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:36.700\nI'm gonna have a measurable change in\nperformance because I'm monitoring it.\n\n425\n00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.920\nBecause I'm looking and\nexpecting to see that right in here.\n\n426\n00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.740\nMy average disc queue length, well, I\nactually had a maximum earlier of 16 when\n\n427\n00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:50.550\nit spiked up, and looking at it now,\nI see something a little bit shocking.\n\n428\n00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.800\nActually is 16 again.\n\n429\n00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.090\nNow, my average is probably way lower.\n\n430\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:59.130\nMy average is 7.8, 7.9, 8, actually,\nmy average is starting to climb.\n\n431\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.700\nSo my queue length is kinda going back and\nforth there, but\n\n432\n00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.550\nit did spike up to that maximum of 16.\n\n433\n00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:07.510\nNow I'm kind of regretting tracking\nthe maximum instead of the average.\n\n434\n00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.380\nBut I'm seeing something similar now.\n\n435\n00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.690\nWhat does that tell me.\n\n436\n00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.020\nIt tells me that I added a stripe, but\n\n437\n00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.630\nI didn't actually get a performance\ngain out of it in terms of queue length.\n\n438\n00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:20.930\nWhich means my limitation here\nmight not be the discs but\n\n439\n00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.080\nthe controller, the disk controller.\n\n440\n00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.770\nI still have the same disk controller\nin both of these environments,\n\n441\n00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.760\njust one was striping and before it\nwas a standard, stand-alone disk.\n\n442\n00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.920\nSo I may have a problem there.\n\n443\n00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.180\nLet's look at my other metrics and\nsee if we get the same.\n\n444\n00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:39.400\nLooking at my disk second read and\nwrite, I've got .78 and .682.\n\n445\n00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.345\nThose are actually better.\n\n446\n00:20:41.345 --> 00:20:43.998\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> My right speed went from .92 down to\n\n447\n00:20:43.998 --> 00:20:47.920\n.682, that went down a bit, right?\n\n448\n00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.600\nNot double the performance like we\nnormally expect to get out of a stripe,\n\n449\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.460\nbut I did get better performance out\nof it, and that's a measurable number.\n\n450\n00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:02.208\nIt's a number I can look at here and\nread and compare, .682 is lower than .920.\n\n451\n00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:07.130\nIt's two-thirds of the number from\nbefore which is not the greatest.\n\n452\n00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.970\nYou kind of expected it to be half since\nI've got two disks doing the work.\n\n453\n00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.270\nBut, you see we don't necessarily\nrealize that performance.\n\n454\n00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:16.020\nThis is why it's important to measure and\ntune and optimize, right?\n\n455\n00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:16.940\nAnd verify.\n\n456\n00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.000\nI might add more disks and\nnever even think about the fact that hey,\n\n457\n00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.150\nmy controller can only handle so\nmuch bandwidth, right?\n\n458\n00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.990\nAnd if I'm exceeding the controller's\nbandwidth no matter how many discs I\n\n459\n00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.230\nadd it's not gonna help, right?\n\n460\n00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.230\nI'm already at that limit.\n\n461\n00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.030\n>> So looking at these numbers right here\nDon, where you did in some aspects you got\n\n462\n00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:36.120\na little bit better performance but\nin other metrics here you\n\n463\n00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.670\ndidn't get better performance we\nyou might have to scale up, right?\n\n464\n00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.050\nMight be something where we need\nto consider different hardware,\n\n465\n00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.000\nif we need a certain level of performance.\n\n466\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.560\n>> Yeah, scaling up is one option.\n\n467\n00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.640\nScaling out is the other, right?\n\n468\n00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.350\nAnd there are always,\nwell, not always an option.\n\n469\n00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.880\nScaling up has its limits.\n\n470\n00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.600\nIn this case, if I wanna scale up,\nI just add in more disks.\n\n471\n00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.460\nI got a little bit of a gain,\nbut it wasn't great, right?\n\n472\n00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.080\nIf I really wanna scale this one up I\nneed to replace that controller, right?\n\n473\n00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.850\nI've got a RAID controller, a SAS or SETA.\n\n474\n00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:02.690\nI didn't pay attention here.\n\n475\n00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:03.400\nOne of those.\n\n476\n00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.890\nAnd it's just I'm hitting its limits.\n\n477\n00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.140\nSo I can replace it with something better,\nor maybe the controller is great, but\n\n478\n00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.920\nthe port I've plugged it into, right?\n\n479\n00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.720\nMaybe it's a PCI Express 2, and\nI can put it into a PCI Express 16,\n\n480\n00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.930\nand get way better performance out of it.\n\n481\n00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.370\nI need to look at that, I need to\ngo break down my documentation and\n\n482\n00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.230\nevaluate the hardware that I've got.\n\n483\n00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.230\nNow as far as scaling up there does\ncome a point where you hit your limit.\n\n484\n00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.700\nWhere you've got the best RAID\ncontroller on the market, and\n\n485\n00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.080\nyou've spent all the money\nyou can spent and\n\n486\n00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.170\nthere's nothing better out there,\nthen we get to scale out.\n\n487\n00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:37.060\nScaling out is I'm running\nfour scripts at the same time.\n\n488\n00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.410\nDo they all have to run\nagainst the same disk?\n\n489\n00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.800\nCould I add four controllers and\nhave four separate arrays and\n\n490\n00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.820\nhave each script running\non its own separate array?\n\n491\n00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.210\nYes, yes I could do that, right?\n\n492\n00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:51.200\nAnd I could get data connectivity\nthere and now each of them\n\n493\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.880\ngets that better performance and\nwe start to cut our numbers down that way.\n\n494\n00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.860\nOr I can go to multiple physical servers.\n\n495\n00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.470\nAnd now, I have it where my scripts\nare running on four different boxes.\n\n496\n00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.060\nAgain, all exclusive access to hardware.\n\n497\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.040\nThat's scaling out.\n\n498\n00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.330\nAnd you can always scale out.\n\n499\n00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.220\nScaling out is always an option.\n\n500\n00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.300\nScaling up is not, right?\n\n501\n00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.830\nThere are times where you just\ncan't scale up and you hit it.\n\n502\n00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.350\nI say scaling out is always an option.\n\n503\n00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.630\nI'm sure I'll get at least one e-mail\nabout this, like Don this program\n\n504\n00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.390\nisn't even multi threaded,\nhow am I supposed to scale that out?\n\n505\n00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.010\nWell that happens, right?\n\n506\n00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.990\nBut your developers, they can update that\nsoftware to where it is multi threaded,\n\n507\n00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.780\nwhere it can be spread out across multiple\nhosts, where it can do all these things.\n\n508\n00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.370\nJust because your software can't do\nit does not mean it's not possible.\n\n509\n00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.920\nIt may mean you don't have enough\nmoney to make it possible.\n\n510\n00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.550\nBut it is certainly possible.\n\n511\n00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.320\nSo definitely keep that in mind.\n\n512\n00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.450\nThe other thing is I'm\ntalking about hardware.\n\n513\n00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.760\nSo we just saw a great hardware example.\n\n514\n00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.700\nThere's software examples too.\n\n515\n00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.480\nRemember that your disk\nIO can be throttled.\n\n516\n00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.211\nI showed that when we were talking\nabout Amazon Web Services,\n\n517\n00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:50.888\nin several of the episodes now, I've shown\nyou guys where we can do provisioned IOs\n\n518\n00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:52.379\nper second or provisioned IOps.\n\n519\n00:23:52.379 --> 00:23:53.729\nAnd if I pick a system,\n\n520\n00:23:53.729 --> 00:23:57.650\nit might be running on SSDs with\nan amazing performance profile.\n\n521\n00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:02.510\nBut I've only paid for 24 iops, and\nso I'm gonna be limited to 24 iops.\n\n522\n00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.580\nDoesn't matter what the discs are, doesn't\nmatter what array technology they've got,\n\n523\n00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.050\nI'm being artificially throttled.\n\n524\n00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:11.325\nSo be aware, if that happens, in the case\nof Amazon, you just gotta pay more.\n\n525\n00:24:11.325 --> 00:24:13.890\n[LAUGH] You gotta pay more for\ncertain more iops, and you'll get that,\n\n526\n00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.010\nyou'll have that access,\nand you'll be in business.\n\n527\n00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.580\nSo it's not always\nhardware that's at fault.\n\n528\n00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.595\nWe could be doing software throttling.\n\n529\n00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.660\nThere's a few other things that I\njust want to mention real quick\n\n530\n00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.890\non the level of storage.\n\n531\n00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.750\nWe've got the other one's,\nI guess we'll do part three,\n\n532\n00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.540\ncuz I just can't seem to shut up.\n\n533\n00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:34.360\nBut there's other things like you swap\nspace, every system has a swap file.\n\n534\n00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.510\nI you run out of RAM,\nyou start to use your swap file.\n\n535\n00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.540\nYour swap file exists\neven if you don't use it.\n\n536\n00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:42.010\nHopefully, you've got enough RAM that\nyou never have to use the swap file.\n\n537\n00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.070\nBut if you do, when you do need it,\nit's slow, and it stinks, and\n\n538\n00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.700\nyour system's gonna hurt for it, but\nyou don't want your system to go offline.\n\n539\n00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:53.290\nIf you remove your swap space, if you just\neliminate it, when you run out of RAM,\n\n540\n00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.050\nyour system locks up, it's that simple.\n\n541\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.640\nYour system locks up, and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n542\n00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.940\nIn some cases, it'll shut down, but\na lot of times, it just locks up, so\n\n543\n00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.730\nyou wanna have swap space available.\n\n544\n00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.700\nIf you do have to use it,\nyou want that swap space optimized.\n\n545\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.880\nNormally we recommend having dedicated\ndrives just for the swap space.\n\n546\n00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.210\nGet it off your operating system drives,\nget it off of other system,\n\n547\n00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.050\nmove it to it's own disk.\n\n548\n00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.490\nThe reason it needs to be on\nit's own disk is two fold.\n\n549\n00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.300\nOne is performance,\nyou need to be able to read and\n\n550\n00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.250\nwrite to that disk as fast as possible,\nbecause you're using it as memory.\n\n551\n00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.720\nSo you need the best performance\npossible on those disks.\n\n552\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.600\nThe second thing is,\nif you're sharing a partition like,\n\n553\n00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.310\nwith your operating system,\nwe use Windows.\n\n554\n00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.680\nEvery time Windows does a Windows\nupdate it downloads a copy update and\n\n555\n00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.900\nit saves it and that WIndows update\nfolder grows and grows, and grows.\n\n556\n00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.820\nAnd what you might find is your\nWindows updates take up so\n\n557\n00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.120\nmuch space on the drive that your\npage file can no longer expand.\n\n558\n00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.700\nAnd now, once your page file can\nexpand you run out of memory,\n\n559\n00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.050\nyour system locks up.\n\n560\n00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:45.840\nIt creates an outage.\n\n561\n00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.380\nRight.\n\n562\n00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.030\nSo, we need to make sure to optimize\nour swap space wherever that is.\n\n563\n00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:52.430\nIn the Linux world, we normally\ncreated dedicated partition for\n\n564\n00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.360\nit and that's great.\n\n565\n00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.680\nIn the Windows world, it throws an on in\nthe operating system partition by default.\n\n566\n00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.140\nAnd it's up to you to move it.\n\n567\n00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.230\nSo make sure you do that.\n\n568\n00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.910\nMove it somewhere else,\n\n569\n00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.460\npreferably on a dedicated disk if you\nknow you are going to be hitting that.\n\n570\n00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.970\nIf it's just like an emergency stop gap,\nyou know, you anticipate never using\n\n571\n00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:13.150\nthe swap space, then you might choose to\ncut some corners there but it is a risk.\n\n572\n00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.610\nIf you do that,\nmake sure you monitor your swap space.\n\n573\n00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.940\nMonitor how much of it's used,\nhow much is available.\n\n574\n00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.510\nMonitor it from the memory standpoint.\n\n575\n00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.610\nWe'll talk about that later.\n\n576\n00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.740\nBut monitor it from\nthe disk standpoint also.\n\n577\n00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.420\nI wanna know.\nI wanna know ahead of time\n\n578\n00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.660\nif that disk is running out of space so\nI can take action before it actually does.\n\n579\n00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.350\n>> Would that be something, Don, if you,\nI think of some of the old little\n\n580\n00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:34.300\nSSDs I have,\nnow we're talking production environment.\n\n581\n00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.070\nSo it is a little bit different here.\n\n582\n00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:41.620\nBut like a smaller SSD, where you don't\nhave to get the $5000 terabyte SSD.\n\n583\n00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.840\nYou can get maybe a smaller SSD and\njust dedicate it to your page file.\n\n584\n00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.840\n>> You can absolutely.\n\n585\n00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.340\nMy rule of thumb is that\ngenerally more drives\n\n586\n00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.380\nperform better than\nfewer expensive drives.\n\n587\n00:26:54.380 --> 00:27:01.360\nRight, so I can get a single four\nterabyte 10,000 RPM drive, or\n\n588\n00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.970\nI could get four one terabyte\ndrives that are 72 hundred RPM.\n\n589\n00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.210\nThey're slower, but I've got more of them,\n\n590\n00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.410\nI've got more drives ready to\ndo work on spinning disks.\n\n591\n00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.800\nOn SSD we don't worry about\nthe RPMs any more, right?\n\n592\n00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.170\nSo on SSDs, still having four disks\nthat are able to do lookups and\n\n593\n00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.790\naccess data is gonna be\nfaster than having one.\n\n594\n00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.690\nAnd so I'll normally try and get more.\n\n595\n00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:27.010\nI know we just ordered a network,\na NAS box here, network attached storage.\n\n596\n00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.860\nAnd we had that option of doing\na bunch of four terabyte drives and\n\n597\n00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.690\nI chose to go with smaller drives.\n\n598\n00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:35.480\nSmaller drives are more reliable, right,\nbecause the technology's been proven.\n\n599\n00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.810\nBut also,\nyou get more disks doing the work for you,\n\n600\n00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:39.880\nyou get better performance out of it.\n\n601\n00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.530\nSo all things we need to consider\nwhen we're dealing with storage.\n\n602\n00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:44.500\n>> Very good information.\n\n603\n00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.950\nNow keep in mind in this episode,\nwe've been optimizing performance, right?\n\n604\n00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:51.330\nIn our part two here we've been\nlooking at the disk performance.\n\n605\n00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.790\nDon, got anything for us in this episode?\n\n606\n00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:54.740\n>> We haven't touch RAM.\n\n607\n00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.650\nWe haven't touch network.\n\n608\n00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.640\nWe haven't touch CPU.\n\n609\n00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.550\nSo, in our next episode,\nwe're gonna tackle those guys.\n\n610\n00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:01.860\nYou'll see, it's much the same, right?\n\n611\n00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.670\nYou measure your CPU.\n\n612\n00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:04.050\nYou measure your RAM.\n\n613\n00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:08.250\nAnd when you've got problems there,\nyou just to add more to your solution.\n\n614\n00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.250\nBut we'll talk about monitoring\nthose things we can do.\n\n615\n00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.530\nOn the network side though,\nwe're gonna talk about NIC teaming and\n\n616\n00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.575\nsome other technology we can\nuse to optimize our bandwidth.\n\n617\n00:28:14.575 -->

          "description": "In this episode Wes and Don continue their discussion on performance optimization. They look at memory performance and the techniques to optimizes memory. They demonstrate concepts such as memory failure, oversubscription and memory ballooning. With networking being a major dependency of cloud computing, Wes and Don will dive into network performance topic like NIC failure, replication, latency and load balancing. They explain common CPU concepts like virtual CPU count and hyperthreading as well as monitoring service performance.",

00:00:15.954\nI am your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:19.880\nin today's episode we're going to be\nmoving along in our cloud plus training.\n\n5\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.030\nAnd we're actually coming back with a part\nthree, yes that's right, part three,\n\n6\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.115\nof optimizing performance and we got Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:28.440\nDon Pezet on hand to help\nus out on this information.\n\n8\n00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.080\nDon, how you're doing,\nand welcome back, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.630\nI am doing great, Wes, and\nglad to be back on the show.\n\n10\n00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.280\nAnd just to kind of recap,\n\n11\n00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.080\nback in part one, we talked about some\nof the general performance counters and\n\n12\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.220\nmetrics that we need to be watching in our\nsystem for our big four components, right?\n\n13\n00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.520\nProcessor, memory, network,\nand disk IO, right?\n\n14\n00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.820\nAnd then in the second part,\nwe really just focused on disk, and\n\n15\n00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.030\nI wanted to make sure we did that,\n\n16\n00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.820\nthat we took a deep dive in there because\ndisk is normally where your bottleneck is.\n\n17\n00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.480\nSo it is usually the common element\nwhen we've got problems on the network.\n\n18\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.600\nAnd we took a look at how to measure that\nperformance, and take a baseline, and\n\n19\n00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.370\ncompare it to newer activity to see if\nwe've had improvements or regressions or\n\n20\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.290\nwe're getting bad performance,\nand take some actions there.\n\n21\n00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.320\nIn this episode, I want to speed\nthings up just a little bit because\n\n22\n00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.810\nwe're gonna take a look at CPU,\nmemory, and network.\n\n23\n00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.650\nAnd for the most part, you'll find that\nit's really the same exact activity,\n\n24\n00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.630\nthat we measure our metrics, the metrics\nwe talked about way back in part one, and\n\n25\n00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.930\nthen any time we have a problem,\nwe take new metrics and we compare them to\n\n26\n00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.570\nthe original, to that base line\nto see if we've got a difference.\n\n27\n00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.000\nThere's really not much\nof a difference there.\n\n28\n00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.820\nWe've already talked about the counters,\nthe application,\n\n29\n00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.020\nthe principle's the same, but I want to\nrun through a few different scenarios\n\n30\n00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.760\nof when you might have problems\nin certain areas, all right?\n\n31\n00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.060\nSo we're going to take a look at CPU,\nnetwork, and memory RAM, right?\n\n32\n00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.320\nKind of an important one there.\n\n33\n00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.710\nAnd each of the different kind of\n\n34\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.740\npit falls that we see in\na virtualized environment.\n\n35\n00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.890\n>> One of the first things we think about\nwhen we think, wel, I think about memory,\n\n36\n00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.530\nis well, do we have enough memory,\nright, Don?\n\n37\n00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.580\nHow many virtual machines we have\nversus how much RAM does the host have.\n\n38\n00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.980\nAnd when it comes down to it, I mean,\nthat's not the only consideration, right?\n\n39\n00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.740\nIt's not just about how much of the RAM\nyou have, but it's also about how\n\n40\n00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.575\nthe machines are or are not effectively\nperforming with that memory, right?\n\n41\n00:02:11.575 --> 00:02:14.705\n>> Absolutely, and I think I even\nsaid this in an earlier episode,\n\n42\n00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:17.455\nis that a lot of times, we can throw\nmoney at a problem and solve it.\n\n43\n00:02:17.455 --> 00:02:20.125\nAnd so if you're running out of memory,\nyou can just add more memory, and\n\n44\n00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:21.725\nyour problem is solved, right?\n\n45\n00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:24.375\nBut the reality of the story is that\nthere is a maximum amount of memory\n\n46\n00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:25.625\na server can have.\n\n47\n00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:28.690\nAnd usually to get high\nquantities of memory,\n\n48\n00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.260\nyou have to have a lot\nof sticks of memory.\n\n49\n00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.380\nSo you'll have a lot of actual slots.\n\n50\n00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.830\nWhen you take your average desktop\ncomputer, it might have two, three, or\n\n51\n00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.140\nfour slots for RAM sticks, right?\n\n52\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.650\nBut when you take a server,\nit may have eight.\n\n53\n00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.120\nIf it's a really high end server,\nit may have 16 slots for RAM sticks.\n\n54\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.040\nAnd if you have 16sticks of\nRAM inside of your server,\n\n55\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.680\nyou've got a much higher\nchance of having failed memory\n\n56\n00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.120\nthan if you've only got two\nsticks of memory in there, right?\n\n57\n00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.790\nIt's just more common for that to happen.\n\n58\n00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.900\nYou've got more parts in the equation.\n\n59\n00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.170\nAnd most of us never have to deal with\nmemory failure, but it does happen, right?\n\n60\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.000\nAnd usually it happens right away.\n\n61\n00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000\nYou install some new memory and it's dead,\ndead on arrival, and that's it.\n\n62\n00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.527\nBut memory is so sensitive to things like\nelectrostatic discharge that it can fail\n\n63\n00:03:11.527 --> 00:03:13.890\nover time and memory can run hot.\n\n64\n00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.130\nNow in a server there's all sorts of\nthings that can generate heat, and\n\n65\n00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.938\nif you create that perfect storm\nof heat in inside of a server,\n\n66\n00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:23.245\nit starts to cook and memory is usually\none of the first things to suffer.\n\n67\n00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:25.045\nIt's not very tolerant of heat.\n\n68\n00:03:25.045 --> 00:03:27.525\nYour CPU actually has\npretty high tolerances.\n\n69\n00:03:27.525 --> 00:03:29.705\nYour hard drives usually\nhave high tolerances, but\n\n70\n00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:32.265\nRAM is usually the one\nthat's the least giving.\n\n71\n00:03:32.265 --> 00:03:35.215\nAnd so you can have memory fail, and\nthat's why when you look at your servers,\n\n72\n00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:38.295\nwhen you pick something like some\nof the higher end HP ProLiants,\n\n73\n00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:39.775\nthey have redundant RAM.\n\n74\n00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:42.630\nIt's actually pretty amazing stuff\nwhere you can have two banks of memory\n\n75\n00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.010\nthat are clones of each other.\n\n76\n00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.710\nAnd if it starts picking up failures\non one, it can switch to the other.\n\n77\n00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.280\nIt's pretty neat stuff.\n\n78\n00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.790\nThere's memory that actually has\nerror-checking built into it,\n\n79\n00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.210\nECC memory, right, where it's doing\nparity checks, just like with RAID.\n\n80\n00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.680\nAnd that can happen too.\n\n81\n00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.890\nThe biggest challenge with all of this is\nit's very hard to see it coming, right?\n\n82\n00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.630\nI showed you a bunch of performance\ncounters for monitoring memory, but\n\n83\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.710\nif I start to have memory failures,\nperformance counters don't show that.\n\n84\n00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.260\nI mean, I might start seeing that I get\nlatency, that it takes longer to read and\n\n85\n00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.080\nwrite from memory because\nwe're having to do retrys.\n\n86\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.480\nSo we might see suffering\nin performance there, but\n\n87\n00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.010\nif the memory has failed,\nthat doesn't necessarily show up, and\n\n88\n00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.910\nthat's where we have to rely\non our third party vendors.\n\n89\n00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.721\nYou know Dell has their whole\nmanagement software solution,\n\n90\n00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.298\nyou can install manager servers.\n\n91\n00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:28.073\nHP has their insight software where you\ncan manage the servers, and they'll\n\n92\n00:04:28.073 --> 00:04:32.680\nactually do hardware checks to validate\nthat you're not suffering from a failure.\n\n93\n00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.650\nOn a performance side, though,\nwe usually just see sagging performance,\n\n94\n00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.809\nbecause we're having\nto do a lot of retrys.\n\n95\n00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:38.260\nSame thing goes for failing hard drives.\n\n96\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.460\nIf a hard drive fails out right,\nthere we go, then we might see suffering\n\n97\n00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.410\nperformance because we're running\non redundant copies of the storage.\n\n98\n00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.060\nBut if it's a mirror and one drive fails,\nwe probably won't notice that at all.\n\n99\n00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.650\nSo you've gotta combine your performance\nmonitoring with your hardware monitoring\n\n100\n00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.250\nalso, and there's a number of third\nparty solutions out there that do it.\n\n101\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.580\nYour guest operating systems, though, and\nyour host operating systems like VMWare\n\n102\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.510\nand Hyper-V running on Windows or\nKVM running on Red Hat, they don't do\n\n103\n00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.910\nthe hardware checking because they're\nnot the hardware manufacturers.\n\n104\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.140\nThey don't have that ability to check it,\n\n105\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.430\nand that's why we've got to\nrely on third party software.\n\n106\n00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.830\n>> So Don, I'm gonna jump out and\n\n107\n00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.550\nI'm gonna throw a question at\nyou before we even get started.\n\n108\n00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.670\nSo with memory inconsistencies,\nright, memory problems,\n\n109\n00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.530\nI should say the inconsistencies.\n\n110\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.190\nSometimes you see memory problems.\n\n111\n00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.310\nMaybe sometimes they're not there.\n\n112\n00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.610\nIs this something that you would have\nto maybe do a trending analysis,\n\n113\n00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.760\nyou know, over the course of time just to\nkind of trouble shoot what's happening?\n\n114\n00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.620\n>> You can, it's tough, right,\n\n115\n00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.800\nbecause some of the stuff doesn't\nhave a correlation with performance.\n\n116\n00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.110\nSo if it's a memory error for, example,\na memory error will only show up\n\n117\n00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.360\nwhen you're writing to that particular\nbit of memory where there's a problem.\n\n118\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.720\nAnd memory writes\nare generally semi-random.\n\n119\n00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.210\nThey kind of write all over\nthe place on the memory stick.\n\n120\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.190\nSo you might only hit that error once\nevery 8 days, or once every 15 days.\n\n121\n00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.410\nAnd it might not be every 15 days.\n\n122\n00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.930\nIt might happen on Tuesday, and did not\nhappen again until the next Monday, and\n\n123\n00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.120\nthen it happens again,\nright away on Wednesday.\n\n124\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.800\nIt can be variations, right?\n\n125\n00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.340\nIntermittent problems are really\nhard to troubleshoot, and\n\n126\n00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.820\nthat's why we need that\nthird-party software.\n\n127\n00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.340\nIt's really important, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.060\nSo if you wanna learn more about these,\nthe exam doesn't drive too much into them,\n\n129\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.810\nother than the fact that you\nreally need to have them.\n\n130\n00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.800\nBut like HP's system insight manager,\n\n131\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.020\nit is one of the most common\nones that's out there.\n\n132\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.900\nMost of the vendors make it available for\nfree.\n\n133\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.290\nSo, Dell's is free, HP's is free.\n\n134\n00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.612\nYou install it, it reaches out and\nit monitors all of your servers.\n\n135\n00:06:28.612 --> 00:06:31.850\nIt uses SNMP and agents that\nare installed on the servers themselves\n\n136\n00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.102\nto track that hardware health,\nand that's really important.\n\n137\n00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:37.670\nWith RAM we usually only have\ntwo things to worry about,\n\n138\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.050\none, having enough of it,\nand two, hardware failures.\n\n139\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.910\nIt's really pretty simple, and\n\n140\n00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.100\nhaving enough of it is just a matter\nof monitoring performance, right?\n\n141\n00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.740\nAnd we saw the performance counters\nin an earlier episode, but\n\n142\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.810\nwe just need to check that out.\n\n143\n00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.090\nNow, I will mention a few other\nthings when in comes to RAM.\n\n144\n00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.350\nOne problem is that a lot of\nvirtualization products out there offer\n\n145\n00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.460\nneat ways to optimize your memory, and\n\n146\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.870\nit's almost all not intended\nto be used in production.\n\n147\n00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:07.990\nSo one of the ones I talked about\nearlier was a memory oversubscription,\n\n148\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.980\nwhere our virtual machines require\nmore memory than our host has, right?\n\n149\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.710\nIt's called memory ballooning.\n\n150\n00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:14.870\nThink of a balloon.\n\n151\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.550\nYou can inflate a balloon and\nyou can deflate a balloon, right?\n\n152\n00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.860\nSo you can fill it up with\nthe volume of air that you need.\n\n153\n00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.500\nWell, that's kind of how\na virtual machine is.\n\n154\n00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.690\nWhen you give a virtual\nmachine 8 gigs of RAM,\n\n155\n00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.190\ndoes it need 8 gigs of RAM right then?\n\n156\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.600\nNot necessarily, if it just booted up,\nit might only need 1 gig of ram.\n\n157\n00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.170\nAnd then over time it might grow and\ncontract,\n\n158\n00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.390\nthis elasticity we have, for\njust certain amounts of memory.\n\n159\n00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.220\nSo what we can do is\nwe can give a variable\n\n160\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.360\namount of memory to our virtual machines.\n\n161\n00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.390\nAnd if you do that,\n\n162\n00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:47.280\nyou can actually give your VMs more\nmemory than the host itself has, right?\n\n163\n00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.237\nAnd I know that sounds like a bad idea.\n\n164\n00:07:49.237 --> 00:07:51.001\nIt's not necessarily a bad idea.\n\n165\n00:07:51.001 --> 00:07:52.998\nIt's a bad idea in production.\n\n166\n00:07:52.998 --> 00:07:57.224\nIf I give a machine eight gigs of ram and\nit's Fake memory, right?\n\n167\n00:07:57.224 --> 00:08:00.955\nExpandable memory, then that machine could\npotentially get eight gigs of ram and\n\n168\n00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:02.690\nit could potentially not get it.\n\n169\n00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.990\nIt could try and get that memory and not\nhave it available and what's gonna happen?\n\n170\n00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.448\nWe're gonna page it out to disk, right?\n\n171\n00:08:07.448 --> 00:08:10.473\nPage it to the hard drive, and\nas soon as we start swapping to disk,\n\n172\n00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:12.324\nwe get a performance decrease, right?\n\n173\n00:08:12.324 --> 00:08:15.060\nAnd I think I showed these settings before\nbut let me just bring them up here again.\n\n174\n00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.730\nI've got a Hyper-V server fired up here.\n\n175\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.396\nHyper-V has it, VMware ESX has it, Citrix\nZen server has it, so all the big players\n\n176\n00:08:22.396 --> 00:08:26.840\nin the virtualization platform,\nthey've all got this functionality.\n\n177\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.210\nBut when you create a virtual machine,\nlike I'll take this router, right here.\n\n178\n00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.510\nSo I've got this router here in Hyper-V,\nand if I jump into it's settings and\n\n179\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.320\nI take a look at the memory, right?\n\n180\n00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.940\nLooking at this, it says it's\ngot two gigs of memory assigned.\n\n181\n00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.782\nNow, I've only got so\nmuch memory in this server and\n\n182\n00:08:43.782 --> 00:08:48.369\nI'm probably running out of it already cuz\nI think I've got maybe five gigs of memory\n\n183\n00:08:48.369 --> 00:08:51.169\nalready assigned out to\nsome of these other hosts.\n\n184\n00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:53.784\nAnd I think I've only got eight\ngigs of RAM in this system so,\n\n185\n00:08:53.784 --> 00:08:57.120\nI don't have a ton of memory to play\nwith on this particular server.\n\n186\n00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.790\nSo if I want to give this\none two gigs of memory,\n\n187\n00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.530\nI might not have enough available\nmemory to start this system, right?\n\n188\n00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.633\nSo for example here,\nlet me let me just come in and\n\n189\n00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:12.421\nI'm gonna bump that up to let's say 4096,\nI'm gonna give it four gigs of RAM, okay?\n\n190\n00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:15.573\nSo it's got a start up of four\ngigs of RAM, I'm gonna hit OK and\n\n191\n00:09:15.573 --> 00:09:17.780\nI'm gonna start this system, all right?\n\n192\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.410\nSo I'm gonna start it up,\nnow here it goes starting and\n\n193\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.450\nwhat's gonna happen is it fails to start,\nright?\n\n194\n00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.200\nError occurred while attempting\nto start the machine,\n\n195\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.630\ncould not initialize,\nnot enough memory in the system.\n\n196\n00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.110\nI just don't have enough memory\navailable for it, right?\n\n197\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.476\nI tried to give it four gigs of RAM,\nbut I've got dc01,\n\n198\n00:09:33.476 --> 00:09:38.264\ndc02, and router 01, these guys are\nconsuming three and a half gigs of RAM.\n\n199\n00:09:38.264 --> 00:09:41.610\nI've only got eight gigs of memory, and\nmy underlying OS needs some memory.\n\n200\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.202\nAnd so between all of these machines,\n\n201\n00:09:43.202 --> 00:09:45.159\nthere's just not enough\nmemory to go around.\n\n202\n00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:49.321\nBut if I take that router, and I go\nback into its settings, I can tell it,\n\n203\n00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:52.470\nyeah four gigs of memory, whatever.\n\n204\n00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.857\nMaybe I set a startup of\nonly one gig of memory.\n\n205\n00:09:54.857 --> 00:09:59.376\nBut then I enable dynamic memory,\nand I say that it can go down,\n\n206\n00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:01.266\nas low as 512, right?\n\n207\n00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:04.280\nMaybe that's all it needs,\nand it can go as high as,\n\n208\n00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.140\nand you can shoot the moon here.\n\n209\n00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.655\nYou can go way beyond what we've got.\n\n210\n00:10:07.655 --> 00:10:10.710\nI've got eight gigs of\nRAM in this computer.\n\n211\n00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.353\nBut I could say 16384, right?\n\n212\n00:10:13.353 --> 00:10:16.866\nNow, why would I want to say that it\ncan have 16 gigs of RAM when I've only\n\n213\n00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.130\ngot 8 gigs?\n\n214\n00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.460\nWell, in a virtual environment,\n\n215\n00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.270\nyour guest is not necessarily\ndependent on the underlying host.\n\n216\n00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.520\nI could take this guest and\nmove it to another host.\n\n217\n00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.450\nAnd on that other host,\n\n218\n00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.460\nI might have 64 gigs of RAM and I might be\nable to expand all the way to 16, right?\n\n219\n00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.260\nAnd so by giving it this higher number,\nI could move at different places and\n\n220\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.930\ntake advantage of that,\nif I know to do that.\n\n221\n00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.022\nBut if I leave it right here,\nit's a recipe for disaster.\n\n222\n00:10:42.022 --> 00:10:46.780\nWhat's gonna happen is the guest\nmight be running at 6 gigs of RAM,\n\n223\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.810\nand the guest thinks everything is fine\ncuz it has up to 16 gigs available, right?\n\n224\n00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.050\nBut on the host, I can see\nthe host is almost out of memory.\n\n225\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.070\nAnd that's why it's so\n\n226\n00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.235\nimportant that we monitor these things\nin the guest as well as in the host.\n\n227\n00:10:59.235 --> 00:11:00.840\nYou gotta monitor from both sides.\n\n228\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.210\nBut once I have this dynamic memory set,\nand I come in here and\n\n229\n00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.630\nI tell it okay,\nI'll be able to start this router.\n\n230\n00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.940\nEven though I don't necessarily\nhave enough memory for\n\n231\n00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.110\nit, it's gonna start up because\nI've set this dynamic memory.\n\n232\n00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.463\nAnd there it goes, it's booting up,\nno error this time,\n\n233\n00:11:16.463 --> 00:11:19.980\nand now I'm running this other system even\nthough I've kind of given it fake memory.\n\n234\n00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.560\nNow, the instant it tries to expand and\n\n235\n00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.160\nuse that other memory,\nit's gonna do one of two things.\n\n236\n00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.790\nIt's either gonna swap to disk or\n\n237\n00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.380\nit's gonna suspend the machine,\ntake it offline, right?\n\n238\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.770\nOne of those two events will\nhappen depending on whether or\n\n239\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.610\nnot I've got my virtualization\ntools installed on it.\n\n240\n00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.601\nAnd Mike built that machine, so I don't\nknow if he did it or not, but assuming he\n\n241\n00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:39.980\ndid, then it'll just start swapping\nto disk and that'll be the end of it.\n\n242\n00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.970\nNow, notice our other settings in there\ntoo that we need to pay attention to, and\n\n243\n00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.350\nthese are just more things that you can't\nreally monitor with performance counters\n\n244\n00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.070\nlike I've done in the previous episodes.\n\n245\n00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:53.200\nSo for example, your memory buffering and\nyour memory weight, okay?\n\n246\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.100\nWhat are these?\n\n247\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.030\nWell, the memory buffering, right?\n\n248\n00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.950\nThis is basically setting up a reserve.\n\n249\n00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.170\nAnd saying hey, if you're trying\nto access this dynamic memory,\n\n250\n00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.110\nit may take me a minute to expand\nout to make that available for you.\n\n251\n00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.350\nSo let's reserve a percentage of\ncurrent memory to make it available for\n\n252\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.780\nthe system so it can have it immediately.\n\n253\n00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.340\nAnd it doesn't have to wait for\nme to expand it, right?\n\n254\n00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.260\nThe more reserves I set up,\nthe more quickly I'll run out of memory.\n\n255\n00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.369\nIf I start doing reserves on every\nmachine, if I have five machines and\n\n256\n00:12:19.369 --> 00:12:22.282\nthey've all got a 20% reserve,\nthat's a 100%, right?\n\n257\n00:12:22.282 --> 00:12:24.090\n[LAUGH] So\nI just reserved all of my memory.\n\n258\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.640\nYou have got to be aware of that.\n\n259\n00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.050\nThat doesn't show up in\na performance counter.\n\n260\n00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.560\nIt shows up here in the configuration.\n\n261\n00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.730\nSo that would need to be\npart of our troubleshooting.\n\n262\n00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.478\nAnd then if I have two machines that are\nboth vying for extra memory and I don't\n\n263\n00:12:34.478 --> 00:12:38.528\nhave the corresponding physical memory for\nit, I'm gonna have a battle, right?\n\n264\n00:12:38.528 --> 00:12:40.500\nThey're gonna fight for\naccess to that memory.\n\n265\n00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.390\nAnd we have a tie breaker right here.\n\n266\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.164\nIt's called a memory weight in Hyper-V.\n\n267\n00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:48.046\nAnd we just define who it is that's\nhigh priority versus low priority, and\n\n268\n00:12:48.046 --> 00:12:49.840\nall the tiers in between.\n\n269\n00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.812\nSo a machine might be trying\nto get its extra memory, and\n\n270\n00:12:52.812 --> 00:12:55.670\nit fails cuz somebody else\nhad priority access to it.\n\n271\n00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.200\nWe've gotta classify our machines.\n\n272\n00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.420\nAgain, this is not gonna show up\nin your performance counters, but\n\n273\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.480\nit is absolutely gonna affect\nthe performance of the machines.\n\n274\n00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.060\nSo much so\nthat I never use this in production.\n\n275\n00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.040\nIf I've got production systems,\nI need to know I can count on them.\n\n276\n00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.600\nI need to know that they're gonna\nwork when I ask them to work.\n\n277\n00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.970\nAnd as a result,\nwe don't use dynamic memory like this.\n\n278\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.400\nBut in test environments,\nin lab environments,\n\n279\n00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.130\nwhere you're building things up, you can\ntake advantage of this to build very\n\n280\n00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.260\ncomplex networks,\non a very small amount of hardware.\n\n281\n00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.410\nSo when I'm doing thing\nlike test restores,\n\n282\n00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.050\nI might be doing a test restore\nof ten different servers and\n\n283\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.600\nI'll use dynamic memory so\nI can pull that off my test environment.\n\n284\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.810\nCuz I know my end-users aren't gonna\nbe in it, I don't need as much RAM, and\n\n285\n00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.270\nI can get by with that, right, but\n\n286\n00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.360\nit definitely requires some testing and\nunderstanding your software.\n\n287\n00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.370\n>> I was gonna ask you with\nthe tiered weights there,\n\n288\n00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.860\ncould you give us an example of where\nyou would use that on what servers,\n\n289\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.360\nbut you've already answered that question.\n\n290\n00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.970\nIn a production environment,\nyou wouldn't rely on it as much.\n\n291\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.300\n>> Right, yeah, but let's say you\ndo use this in production, right?\n\n292\n00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.390\nAnything that's mission critical,\nyou bump all the way up to High.\n\n293\n00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.610\nIt's mission critical,\nI gotta have it, right, that's High.\n\n294\n00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.480\nEverything else you start to set tiers,\nand so you say things like I need one\n\n295\n00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.546\ndomain controller, but it'd be nice if\nI could have two domain controllers.\n\n296\n00:14:05.546 --> 00:14:08.531\nAnd so your second domain controller, you\nmight set to the next tier down, right?\n\n297\n00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:11.666\nAnd then you need your file server for\npeople to have access to it,\n\n298\n00:14:11.666 --> 00:14:12.578\nthat'll be High.\n\n299\n00:14:12.578 --> 00:14:16.196\nBut my backup server,\nif I'm in a failure already,\n\n300\n00:14:16.196 --> 00:14:19.909\nthen my backup server might\nbe tiered a little lower.\n\n301\n00:14:19.909 --> 00:14:22.968\nBecause I've already taken my backup so\nI might be restoring from them right now,\n\n302\n00:14:22.968 --> 00:14:25.780\nI don't need to be running more\nbackups in my broken environment.\n\n303\n00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:26.850\nSo those gets a lower priority, right?\n\n304\n00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.440\nAnd you just start to set the tiers and\nyou classify it.\n\n305\n00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.200\nYou might not use all these notches in\nthe middle, you might just use High and\n\n306\n00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.180\nLow, right?\n\n307\n00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.450\nMission critical is High,\neverything else is Low.\n\n308\n00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.220\nOr you might need all\nthe tiers in between.\n\n309\n00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.791\nAnd it's up to you to define that, right?\n\n310\n00:14:38.791 --> 00:14:41.210\nSo definitely keep that in\nmind as you set this up.\n\n311\n00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.250\nAnd be aware there's different\nterminology for this, right?\n\n312\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.997\nSo Microsoft calls it Dynamic Memory.\n\n313\n00:14:44.997 --> 00:14:47.838\nOr they actually call it, well they\nhave a few different names for it.\n\n314\n00:14:47.838 --> 00:14:49.475\nBut Dynamic Memory's the one\nthey show in the UI.\n\n315\n00:14:49.475 --> 00:14:52.899\nVMware likes to call it Memory Ballooning,\nand so that's another term.\n\n316\n00:14:52.899 --> 00:14:54.600\nBut it's the same technology, right?\n\n317\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.000\nGrowing and\nshrinking your memory usage dynamically,\n\n318\n00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.650\nand just like virtual hard drives,\n\n319\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.420\nthat growing operation not necessarily the\nmost friendly thing in the world, right?\n\n320\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.550\nNow that's the memory side,\nCPU is the same way.\n\n321\n00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.228\nOn the CPU side,\nwe can measure performance, right?\n\n322\n00:15:08.228 --> 00:15:10.853\nI talked about the performance\ncounters for CPU and\n\n323\n00:15:10.853 --> 00:15:14.636\nhow we can monitor the percentage of time\nwe stay in the CPU and the queue for\n\n324\n00:15:14.636 --> 00:15:18.310\napplications waiting to get to the CPU,\nwe talked about those.\n\n325\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.041\nI talked about CPU wait time\nwhich is really that queue.\n\n326\n00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:24.108\nThe queue is measuring\nthe amount of processes waiting.\n\n327\n00:15:24.108 --> 00:15:27.530\nCPU wait is measuring\nwhat that wait time is.\n\n328\n00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.990\nWhat's the average wait time for\nsomething to get into your CPU?\n\n329\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.776\nYou'd love it to be zero but the reality\nis systems queue up and you gotta wait.\n\n330\n00:15:33.776 --> 00:15:35.840\nAnd as long as that number is low enough,\nyou're fine.\n\n331\n00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.540\nBut when the number starts to grow,\nyou got some real problems, right?\n\n332\n00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.301\nOne of the things that can really affect\nthis is just like over subscribing memory,\n\n333\n00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:46.356\nwe can over subscribe CPUs, right?\n\n334\n00:15:46.356 --> 00:15:49.632\nSo for example,\ngoing back to this Hyper-V host,\n\n335\n00:15:49.632 --> 00:15:54.061\nnotice this router that I've got\nhas one virtual processor, okay?\n\n336\n00:15:54.061 --> 00:15:55.937\nWell, in my system, actually,\n\n337\n00:15:55.937 --> 00:15:59.428\nI don't even know how many CPU's\ndo I even have in the system.\n\n338\n00:15:59.428 --> 00:16:00.314\nBut let's find out.\n\n339\n00:16:00.314 --> 00:16:04.989\nI think I've got one socket and\ntwo cores, is what I think I have, but\n\n340\n00:16:04.989 --> 00:16:07.100\nlet's go in here and find out.\n\n341\n00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.210\nAnd so looking at this,\nI've got an Intel i5, right?\n\n342\n00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.510\nAnd so, I've only got one of these\nprocessors and it's an i5, so\n\n343\n00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.490\nit's, it's not telling me the cores.\n\n344\n00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.680\nBut i5's, help me out Wes.\n\n345\n00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.230\n>> They're quad-core.\n\n346\n00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.835\n>> They're quad-core?\n>> I'm pretty sure.\n\n347\n00:16:21.835 --> 00:16:22.834\n>> And they don't do hyper-threading,\nright?\n\n348\n00:16:22.834 --> 00:16:24.670\nYou have to have i7's for hyper-threading?\n\n349\n00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.730\n>> No,\nI think all of the Intel processors today,\n\n350\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.570\nmost of them support the Hyper-Threading.\n\n351\n00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.710\nDon't quote me on that.\n\n352\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:31.290\n>> All right.\n\n353\n00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.930\nSo let's just assume it supports\nHyper-Threading then, right?\n\n354\n00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.520\nWell, if I go and\nlook in my performance monitor.\n\n355\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.306\nSo if I jump into here and\ngo into Performance and CPU, right?\n\n356\n00:16:39.306 --> 00:16:44.670\nHere it shows I've got one socket,\ntwo cores, four logical processors.\n\n357\n00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.520\nSo Wes, you're right.\n\n358\n00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.770\nSo one socket,\nI've got one physical CPU, two cores,\n\n359\n00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:52.590\nI've got two physical cores inside of it\nI'm capable of doing two things at once,\n\n360\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.100\nbut I've got four logical processors.\n\n361\n00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.730\nThat's hyper threading.\n\n362\n00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.450\nHyper threading says, look inside of\nthat CPU is a bunch of transistors.\n\n363\n00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.620\nAnd the transistors are doing\nmathematical operations.\n\n364\n00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.610\nFlipping some on, flipping some off.\n\n365\n00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.490\nIf these are off, this one becomes on and\n\n366\n00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.020\nthat's how it performs its\nmechanical operations.\n\n367\n00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.645\nBut there's millions of\ntransistors in there.\n\n368\n00:17:11.645 --> 00:17:15.220\nMicro-transistors, and\nit's not gonna use all of them for\n\n369\n00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.050\na particular mathematical equation.\n\n370\n00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.620\nAnd so sometimes,\nwe can take the unused ones and we just\n\n371\n00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.720\nhappen to be doing math that is completely\ndifferent, than the math on the other one.\n\n372\n00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.400\nAnd so,\nwe perform two things at the same time.\n\n373\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.390\nI think,\nI already covered this in another episode.\n\n374\n00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:30.870\nDidn't I, Wes?\nI'm starting to wrap these\n\n375\n00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:31.460\nthings up in my mind.\n\n376\n00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.220\nSo I know,\nI have talked about that before.\n\n377\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.650\nThe challenge is, when you start\nmonitoring for performance on your system,\n\n378\n00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.850\nin the performance monitor,\nyou'll see these logical processors.\n\n379\n00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.890\nAnd the hyper threaded ones,\nthe actual fake ones,\n\n380\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.390\nthey might show as being completely\navailable, when in reality they aren't.\n\n381\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.510\nAnd so, I stressed in another episode.\n\n382\n00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.640\nWe need to monitor the sockets\nindividually and the cores individually.\n\n383\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.450\nWe need to see individual ones, so\nwe can actually monitor what's there.\n\n384\n00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.540\nAnd I hate hyper threading\non virtualization.\n\n385\n00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.630\nI really do.\nAnd I normally turn it off.\n\n386\n00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.110\nI normally go under the BIOS for\nmy servers and I turn off hyper threading,\n\n387\n00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.440\nbecause it's unreliable and\nit throws off your performance counters.\n\n388\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.570\nMakes it really hard to gauge,\nwhether your servers are active or not.\n\n389\n00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.090\nYou could leave it turned on.\n\n390\n00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.460\nMaybe, sometimes you benefit from it,\nsometimes you don't.\n\n391\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.820\nAnd just make sure you're\nmonitoring your physical cores and\n\n392\n00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.730\nnot monitoring your logical processors,\nthen you get that benefit.\n\n393\n00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:23.230\n>> I was just gonna say that, because you\ndid give us that advice in a previous\n\n394\n00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.360\nepisode that said yes,\nif you have Don't count on those.\n\n395\n00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.780\nDon't count on the logical course and I do\nwant to correct something here, cuz we did\n\n396\n00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:35.520\nhave somebody mention in the chat room out\nthere, that he's got an I5 6400 sky lake\n\n397\n00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.350\nand it doesn't support hyper threading, so\njust make sure that I'm correct on that.\n\n398\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.910\n>> There also might be a desktop edition,\na server edition and a laptop edition.\n\n399\n00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.930\n>> Sure.\n>> [INAUDIBLE] that causes variations.\n\n400\n00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.340\nAlways check the documentation on\nyour CPU's, I know we covered that,\n\n401\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.542\nway back in the beginning of the series.\n\n402\n00:18:50.542 --> 00:18:52.480\nAll right, so on the CPU,\nthat's one thing to watch out for\n\n403\n00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.830\nthe other thing is we can over subscribe\nin our virtual machines, right?\n\n404\n00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.948\nSo we saw in this router, where I\nonly had one VCPU assigned to it, but\n\n405\n00:19:00.948 --> 00:19:06.245\nif I take this client that's sitting\nover here and I go into its CPU's,\n\n406\n00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:10.519\nwe saw where I had one socket,\ntwo cores, four VCPU's.\n\n407\n00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:13.061\nAnd so, I can come in here\nto my virtual processors and\n\n408\n00:19:13.061 --> 00:19:16.390\nI can start to crank that up, and\nsee how it stopped me at four?\n\n409\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.270\nIt capped me off at four.\n\n410\n00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.930\nI could assign four to the system.\n\n411\n00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.210\nIn theory,\nit could be using all four cores.\n\n412\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.150\nThose two hyper threading ones may or\nmay not be there though.\n\n413\n00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.400\nAnd I'm promising it four.\n\n414\n00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.370\nAnd what about all my other VM's?\n\n415\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:28.118\nThey're all still sitting there too.\n\n416\n00:19:28.118 --> 00:19:31.450\nIf I go through and\npromise them all four and\n\n417\n00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:36.240\nI've got 10 VM's,\nI just promised out 40 processors.\n\n418\n00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.590\nI don't have that, right?\n\n419\n00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.550\nWe're hoping,\nthat we don't get contention.\n\n420\n00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:43.660\nWe're hoping that one system needs them\nnow, another system needs them later.\n\n421\n00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.860\nThat may or may not happen.\n\n422\n00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.710\nAnd so, again, we've got to\nmonitor performance on the host,\n\n423\n00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.110\nas well as the VM's to\nbe able to see that.\n\n424\n00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.920\nAnd if we've over promised our processors,\n\n425\n00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.635\nit's just as bad as over promising\nthe memory, if they run out,\n\n426\n00:19:56.635 --> 00:19:58.935\nwe start getting slow performance,\nthings really start to sag.\n\n427\n00:19:58.935 --> 00:20:00.225\n>> So basically, what you're saying is,\n\n428\n00:20:00.225 --> 00:20:02.772\ndon't manage your processors\nlike I manage my credit.\n\n429\n00:20:02.772 --> 00:20:03.684\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n430\n00:20:03.684 --> 00:20:06.010\n>> [LAUGH] No overcommitment there.\n\n431\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.775\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's exactly right,\n\n432\n00:20:07.775 --> 00:20:09.315\nyou have to be careful.\n\n433\n00:20:09.315 --> 00:20:13.455\nDon't get too frugal, and say,\nwell I've only got four cores, and so\n\n434\n00:20:13.455 --> 00:20:16.110\nI'm only gonna run four\nVM's with one CPU each.\n\n435\n00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.580\nWell now, each VM can't take\nadvantage of multiple course.\n\n436\n00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.440\nSo you want to be able to take\nadvantage of multiple course,\n\n437\n00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.540\nyou just need to monitor it.\n\n438\n00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.140\nThat's the thing,\nthis is one of the areas,\n\n439\n00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.250\nwhere you will over subscribe, right?\n\n440\n00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.220\nAnd a lot of the vendors out there\nwill say, ten to one is fine.\n\n441\n00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.920\nSo ten V CPU's to one real CPU is fine or\nyour course is fine.\n\n442\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.620\nBut, it's really up to\nyour performance model.\n\n443\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.980\nYou've gotta look at the performance\nprofile of your guest VM's to see how they\n\n444\n00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.450\nplay nice and just monitor that.\n\n445\n00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.580\n>> So Don, we've looked at things like,\nfor instance, the CPU here.\n\n446\n00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.940\nWe've looked at RAM, right?\n\n447\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.670\nWe've also looked at disk\nI/O on a previous episode.\n\n448\n00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.060\nAnd now,\nI'm thinking cloud based computing, right?\n\n449\n00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:55.160\nWhat is one thing that, if you are gonna\nuse cloud based computing, whether you use\n\n450\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.430\na hybrid or everything's in the cloud,\nthat you're gonna need, right?\n\n451\n00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.980\nAnd that's gonna be our\nnetwork connection.\n\n452\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.290\nSo, networking is going to be very,\nvery important, so we also have to mention\n\n453\n00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.930\nthem, monitor things like our\nnetwork band width install.\n\n454\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.640\n>> Absolutely, now on the networking side,\nagain we've got performance counters,\n\n455\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.670\nyou can watch that bytes in bytes out,\n\n456\n00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.410\nnow just because you've got high band\nwidth it, doesn't mean there's a problem.\n\n457\n00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.400\nRight, it it doesn't mean like\nyou've got failing band width.\n\n458\n00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.740\nBecause that doesn't normally happen.\n\n459\n00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.310\nRight, but you can have failing nits,\nthat could happen.\n\n460\n00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.340\nAnd if you've only got one network card\nand it fails, it's pretty obvious cuz now,\n\n461\n00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.270\nyou can't get to your server, right?\n\n462\n00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.246\nBut there's technologies that we\ncan use to kind of alleviate that,\n\n463\n00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:29.140\nto get us away from it, right?\n\n464\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.450\nSo now, on networks you've only got so\nmany different bandwidths to choose from.\n\n465\n00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.375\nWhen you're talking about a local area\nnetwork, you have hundred megabit,\n\n466\n00:21:36.375 --> 00:21:38.131\ngigabit, and ten gigabit networks, right?\n\n467\n00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:40.819\nAnd there's newer ones, 40 gigs and\n\n468\n00:21:40.819 --> 00:21:45.550\n100 gigs that are coming out but\nfor now, hundred gig and ten gig.\n\n469\n00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.760\nThose are really our three choices.\n\n470\n00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:54.200\nSo, what if you need more, maybe you have\na gig of bandwidth and you need more.\n\n471\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.817\nYou could go to ten gig, which is pretty\npricey, but you can do it, right?\n\n472\n00:21:56.817 --> 00:22:01.124\nOr we can take more than one gig\nadapter and bond them together.\n\n473\n00:22:01.124 --> 00:22:03.761\nWe can do what's called NIC teaming And\nNIC teaming is really neat,\n\n474\n00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:06.880\nbecause we're combining adapters and\nwe get a few different benefits from it.\n\n475\n00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.900\nFirst off, you get load balancing and\nincreased bandwidth.\n\n476\n00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.440\nIf I have a single gigabit adapter,\nI get a gigabit of bandwidth.\n\n477\n00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.210\nBut if I take two gigabit adapters and\n\n478\n00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:19.000\nI bond them together, I now get two\ngigs of bandwidth, that's great.\n\n479\n00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.680\nBut I also get redundancy.\n\n480\n00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.130\nIf one fails,\nI just dropped down to a gig.\n\n481\n00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:26.630\nAnd if I restore service,\nnow I'm back up to two gigs.\n\n482\n00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.510\nAnd my systems run like normal,\nthey just have a little less bandwidth.\n\n483\n00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.580\nFortunately, network adapters\nare really cheap, so\n\n484\n00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.530\nNIC teaming is something you'll almost\nalways use in virtualization hosts.\n\n485\n00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:36.520\nAnd it's pretty straightforward.\n\n486\n00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.110\nLet me show you an example.\n\n487\n00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.290\nSo here in this server,\nlet me see what adapters,\n\n488\n00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.329\nI've got floating around here and\nwe'll get some teaming set up.\n\n489\n00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.380\nDepending on who made your network\nadapters, you may have software from them,\n\n490\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.340\nso if you have broad com or Intel\nadapters, you may have like Intel has\n\n491\n00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.520\nthere Pro Set Software, you can install\nthat lets you manage the adapters.\n\n492\n00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.540\nI'm just gonna use what's built\ninto Windows, but if I go and\n\n493\n00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:00.880\nlook at my adaptors, looks like I got\na couple, so I got a few adaptors,\n\n494\n00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.340\nwe'll take our story plan.\n\n495\n00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.730\nSo I've got this storage local area\nnetwork and I've got two of them, right?\n\n496\n00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.470\nThey're Intel Pro 1,000 adapters.\n\n497\n00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.440\nI've got two of them.\n\n498\n00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.350\nI could use Intel's proset software,\nbut I didn't install the so\n\n499\n00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.250\nI'll use the Windows side, right?\n\n500\n00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.550\nIn the Windows side, it's just a feature\nthat you install to do teaming.\n\n501\n00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.890\nIf you've got VM work ESX,\nit's built into ESX.\n\n502\n00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.640\nIf you've got Zen Server,\nit's built in there.\n\n503\n00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.760\nIn Zen Server they call it ponding.\n\n504\n00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.480\nSo you may see it called bonding,\nNIC teaming, redundancy,\n\n505\n00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.238\nsome call it port aggregation,\nyou hear different names.\n\n506\n00:23:30.238 --> 00:23:31.810\n[CROSSTALK] aggregations,\nit's all the same thing.\n\n507\n00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:32.820\nYep, all the same thing.\n\n508\n00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.350\nLink aggregation can be\na little bit different,\n\n509\n00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.450\ncuz your switch has to be aware of it.\n\n510\n00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.660\nBut otherwise, all the other ones,\nyou can just do it on the server, and\n\n511\n00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.850\nthe switch doesn't really\nget involved in it much.\n\n512\n00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:46.174\nBut if I wanna team these things together,\nI need some kinda software to do it.\n\n513\n00:23:46.174 --> 00:23:47.415\nIn the Windows world,\n\n514\n00:23:47.415 --> 00:23:51.936\nit's actually a feature inside of Windows\nthat you can go to Add Remove Features.\n\n515\n00:23:51.936 --> 00:23:55.651\nI probably already have it installed,\nsince I see Nic Teaming right there.\n\n516\n00:23:55.651 --> 00:23:59.165\nBut if you don't have it on your system,\nyou can just go to manage and\n\n517\n00:23:59.165 --> 00:24:01.000\nadd roles and features.\n\n518\n00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.470\nAnd it's a feature that you\ncan install NIC teaming.\n\n519\n00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:07.340\nLet me just kinda jump\nforward to that real quick.\n\n520\n00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.399\nIt is buried in here,\nsomewhere in my feature list.\n\n521\n00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.400\nWell, actually that's\nnetwork load balancing.\n\n522\n00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.190\nYou know it might be installed by default,\nnow that I think about it,\n\n523\n00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.960\na network load balancing we're going\nto be talking about in our, our\n\n524\n00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.770\ndisaster recovery episodes, but I guess\nNIC Teaming must be installed by default.\n\n525\n00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.550\n>> The protocol that's bound\nto the network adapter,\n\n526\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.250\nI know that there's a new protocol.\n\n527\n00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:27.991\n>> There is.\n\n528\n00:24:27.991 --> 00:24:28.578\n>> The multiplexer.\n\n529\n00:24:28.578 --> 00:24:31.550\n>> And the multiplexor and it's funny,\nbecause if you just try to go and\n\n530\n00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:36.280\nturn it on Right, so if I take my LAN\nhere, and I pull up its properties, and\n\n531\n00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.460\nI go in and I find that multiplexer that\nWes is talking about, this guy right here.\n\n532\n00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.750\nMicrosoft Network Adapter\nMultiplexor Protocol.\n\n533\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.810\nIf I just try and turn that on,\nit actually does something really funny.\n\n534\n00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.303\nIf you check that and say okay,\n\n535\n00:24:46.303 --> 00:24:50.453\nit tells you you're about to disable the\nmultiplexor [LAUGH] and you're like, what?\n\n536\n00:24:50.453 --> 00:24:52.056\nI just told it to turn it on.\n\n537\n00:24:52.056 --> 00:24:55.490\nAnd it's just because it's not supposed\nto be configured from there, right?\n\n538\n00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.450\nWe need to configure\nfrom the server manager.\n\n539\n00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:00.589\nAnd so, if I go in here to NIC Teaming,\nwhere it says Disabled,\n\n540\n00:25:00.589 --> 00:25:01.851\nI can just click on that.\n\n541\n00:25:01.851 --> 00:25:03.300\nAnd it's gonna start a little wizard.\n\n542\n00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.730\nEventually.\n\n543\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:06.410\nHere in the background.\n\n544\n00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.130\nDoes that make sense?\n\n545\n00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.470\nSo it'll start here in the background and\nwhat's it gonna let me do is create teams.\n\n546\n00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:15.160\nSo here's this NIC Teams that I can\ncreate and I don't have any right now.\n\n547\n00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.910\nSo I can just go in here and\ncreate a new team.\n\n548\n00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.240\nAnd now, it's gonna let me pick\nthe adapters that I wanna team.\n\n549\n00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.840\nAnd so,\nI'll just call this my Storage LAN, and\n\n550\n00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.400\nI'll pick those two storage LAN adapters.\n\n551\n00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.901\nThey're both gig adapters, and so\nI'm gonna bond those two together.\n\n552\n00:25:29.901 --> 00:25:32.986\nAnd you'll see you got some advanced\nproperties down here, and these are kind\n\n553\n00:25:32.986 --> 00:25:36.140\nof important, because it's gonna dictate\nhow our fail over happens, right?\n\n554\n00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.590\nMy teaming mode is switched independent,\nthat means the switch doesn't have to know\n\n555\n00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.530\nanything about this,\nwe're going to deal with it.\n\n556\n00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:45.940\nThat's really useful, if I've got one\nadapter running to one switch and\n\n557\n00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.770\nthe other adapter running\nto a second shift.\n\n558\n00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.878\nIf I want full redundancy, right?\n\n559\n00:25:49.878 --> 00:25:53.220\nTwo different switches,\nwe need it to be switch independent.\n\n560\n00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.310\nBut if both of my links are running to\nthe same switch, you can change this and\n\n561\n00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:02.050\nyou can use LACP, that's the link\naggregation and control protocol, LACP.\n\n562\n00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:05.130\nAnd with this one, we can configure\nthe LACP on the switch side.\n\n563\n00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.370\nAnd now, this switch will help us\nachieve better load balancing and\n\n564\n00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:09.990\nquicker link failure detection.\n\n565\n00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.110\nRight.\nIt's a smarter connection, but\n\n566\n00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.330\nit requires both cables go\nto the the same switch.\n\n567\n00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.620\nRight.\nI say both, you can actually add four,\n\n568\n00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.270\neight cables.\n\n569\n00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.960\nYou can add several cables into this.\n\n570\n00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.400\nI'm just doing the one, I'm sorry the two.\n\n571\n00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.200\nSo, I'm gonna stick with\nSwitch Independent.\n\n572\n00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.040\nYou've got Static Teaming also,\nwhich is where, with Static Teaming,\n\n573\n00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.370\nwhat you're really doing is\nkinda setting up fail-over.\n\n574\n00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.440\nOr one's active and one is the standby\nthat'll take over after a failure.\n\n575\n00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.520\nAnd that's why we've got this\nLoad balancing mode, and\n\n576\n00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.190\nthen you can specify to who's that standby\nadapter, who's gonna be the bad guy.\n\n577\n00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:43.240\nBut, I'm gonna do Switch Independent.\n\n578\n00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.960\nI'm gonna stick with a Dynamic load\nbalancing mode, so it's just gonna try and\n\n579\n00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.630\nbalance as best as possible.\n\n580\n00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.630\nYou can do it based on port numbers or\nhashes or whatever, but\n\n581\n00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.160\nwe'll just leave it Dynamic, and then I\ncould choose to make one as a standby.\n\n582\n00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.480\nIn other words, one adapter's active.\n\n583\n00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.660\nIf it fails,\nwe flip over to the other one, right?\n\n584\n00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.080\nNow, I've got one gigabit all the time.\n\n585\n00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.520\nMy bandwidth is reliable, right?\n\n586\n00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.300\nI know it's always gonna be a gig.\n\n587\n00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.600\nIf I set it up to be all adapters active,\nwhen I monitor this,\n\n588\n00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.760\nI might be running at\ntwo gigs of bandwidth.\n\n589\n00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.593\nI'm running fully saturated 100%.\n\n590\n00:27:15.593 --> 00:27:18.893\nAnd then, all of sudden one adapter dies,\nand I drop down to a gig.\n\n591\n00:27:18.893 --> 00:27:22.370\nAnd then on my performance counters,\nI look at that and what do I see?\n\n592\n00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.220\nI'm only using one gig of\nmy two gigs available.\n\n593\n00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.093\nI'm 50% available.\n\n594\n00:27:26.093 --> 00:27:27.335\nNetworks running great.\n\n595\n00:27:27.335 --> 00:27:29.750\nWhen in reality, I lost a gig.\n\n596\n00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.730\nAnd so, what I need to be tracking,\nis not just my current bandwidth, but\n\n597\n00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:34.880\nalso my queues.\n\n598\n00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.220\nAre the buffers on my\nnetwork adapters filling up?\n\n599\n00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.520\nBecause now, yeah, I'm running out of gig,\nbut the buffers are full,\n\n600\n00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.540\nit's dropping traffic, it can't handle\nthe amount of traffic it's getting.\n\n601\n00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.730\nAnd that's how we spot that, right.\n\n602\n00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:48.530\nAlways plan to monitor the failure,\nnot for the success, right?\n\n603\n00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:51.720\nThe failure of the network would be\nthe buffers in the network adapter.\n\n604\n00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.840\nBut, once that's done,\nI can set that up, and\n\n605\n00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.918\nnow it's gonna bond\nthose two guys together.\n\n606\n00:27:55.918 --> 00:27:58.406\nNow, if you're managing\nthe system on this adapter,\n\n607\n00:27:58.406 --> 00:28:02.110\nyou'll get disconnected while it sets\nit up, then it will wake back up.\n\n608\n00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.100\nSo, here we go.\n\n609\n00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.000\nIt's coming up,\nI can see that my status is down, but\n\n610\n00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.290\nit'll take a minute,\nthen it'll come healthy again.\n\n611\n00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.445\nThere's going into a warning and\nit's gonna kind of move through that,\n\n612\n00:28:11.445 --> 00:28:12.400\nand set up.\n\n613\n00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.200\nBut once its done,\nI now got team's network adapters, and\n\n614\n00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.980\nthey're bond together\nabout a two gig link.\n\n615\n00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.550\nAnd as I communicate, if one fails,\nthe other one just picks up the slack.\n\n616\n00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:27.130\nAnd so, when I look at my network\nlist now, looking in here,\n\n617\n00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.430\nI see that I still have storage LAN one,\nstorage LAN two.\n\n618\n00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.230\nBut I've got storage LAN.\n\n619\n00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.950\nThis virtual adapter, that's the team.\n\n620\n00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.350\nAnd so, here's where I would go and\nset up my IP address.\n\n621\n00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.930\nAnd all that other stuff, right?\n\n622\n00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.420\nSo, if I come in here and\nset my IP address.\n\n623\n00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.120\nLet's say,\nthat this is my storage network, right?\n\n624\n00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:48.205\nSo, maybe we do like,\n[LAUGH] can't do an IP that high, can we?\n\n625\n00:28:48.205 --> 00:28:49.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n626\n00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:55.020\nI'll pick a IP address that's\nactually real and get that set up.\n\n627\n00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.950\nAnd if I have a default gateway,\nthis is a storage network, so\n\n628\n00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.480\nI don't want a default gateway on it.\n\n629\n00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.780\nAnd I don't really need DNS either, but\nwe could throw one in if we wanted to.\n\n630\n00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.060\nAnd so, we'll throw that in.\n\n631\n00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:08.340\nAnd so, now I've got my IP\naddress attached to the team and\n\n632\n00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.150\nif one that fails the IP's\nvalid on both adapters and\n\n633\n00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.860\nI can set up my storage connections\n[INAUDIBLE] right over this and\n\n634\n00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.580\niSCSI doesn't even know\nthere's two adapters.\n\n635\n00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.940\nIt just sees it,\nas one adapter and communicates.\n\n636\n00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.690\nAnd if one link fails, that's fine.\n\n637\n00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.911\nWe flip right over to the other one,\nwe get that redundancy, all right.\n\n638\n00:29:24.911 --> 00:29:26.460\nSo that's network.\n\n639\n00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.850\nJust be aware.\n\n640\n00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:31.350\nMonitor your performance, and then\nunderstand there's technologies like these\n\n641\n00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.280\nthat you can bond adapters,\nyou can add adapters,\n\n642\n00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.310\nyou can do a lot of stuff to get it in\nthere and really get that flexibility.\n\n643\n00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.140\n>> So, in the first three parts so\nfar that we've been in the series,\n\n644\n00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.020\nwe've looked at the resources right,\nthe resource, whether it would be a host\n\n645\n00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.150\nresource, whether it would be a resource\nof the guest themselves or utilizing and\n\n646\n00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:48.000\nthat's important, right.\n\n647\n00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.040\nWe talked about the big four,\nthe four horseman,\n\n648\n00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:55.080\nright CPU networking,\nwhat else is there, disk and Ram.\n\n649\n00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.920\nSo, there are other things that\nwe have to look at too, Don and\n\n650\n00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.780\nyou actually called this out in the\nearlier parts of this three part are here.\n\n651\n00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.540\nYou said the services themselves\nare some things that we have to look at,\n\n652\n00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:09.080\nwhere we've really just been focused\non like, resource consumption here.\n\n653\n00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:09.700\n>> Absolutely.\n\n654\n00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.860\nAnd some stuff,\nyou just can't see with performance.\n\n655\n00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.940\nI've been stressing that\nthis whole episode, right?\n\n656\n00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.240\nSo a lot of this stuff,\nwe can only see when we test.\n\n657\n00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.590\nWe've gotta do testing.\n\n658\n00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:21.200\nTest your replication latency,\ntest your fail over ability.\n\n659\n00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.550\nHey, I just set up bonding.\n\n660\n00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.450\nOkay, let me just go unplug one\nof those adapters, is it working?\n\n661\n00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:27.000\nWe need to test that out.\n\n662\n00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.805\nTesting it, lets you find out if\nit's working on your schedule,\n\n663\n00:30:29.805 --> 00:30:33.324\ninstead of waiting for a failure to happen\nand now it's on their schedule right and\n\n664\n00:30:33.324 --> 00:30:33.850\nnot yours.\n\n665\n00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:35.210\nYou want to be able to schedule yourself.\n\n666\n00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:38.980\nSo definitely test and the things you\nwant to test, things like latency and\n\n667\n00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.960\nbandwidth, which we're gonna talk more\nabout in the disaster recovery episodes.\n\n668\n00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.420\nWe'll see that again.\n\n669\n00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.760\nTesting your load balancing,\ntesting your storage,\n\n670\n00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.630\nmaking sure that's all functioning.\n\n671\n00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:51.810\nAnd when we test it, we want to look\nat it not as an individual component,\n\n672\n00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.440\nnot just a NIC team.\n\n673\n00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.700\nBut, as that overall service.\n\n674\n00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.790\nAnd I brought that up,\nwhen we were talking about the Fog Light,\n\n675\n00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:00.790\nDell's Fog Light product.\n\n676\n00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.690\nThis guy right here.\n\n677\n00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:08.472\nAnd with Fog Light, it gives you this nice\nlittle panel where we can see the health.\n\n678\n00:31:08.472 --> 00:31:10.945\nLike this is one virtualization host.\n\n679\n00:31:10.945 --> 00:31:15.260\nAnd so, see how it showing me the eight\nCPU's that it's got the eight cores.\n\n680\n00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.774\nAnd what the utilization\nis everyone's below 6%,\n\n681\n00:31:17.774 --> 00:31:21.690\n6.3 I guess is the highest, right so,\nI can see that's all healthy.\n\n682\n00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:25.950\nI can see my data and packets in and\nout, how much network am I consuming?\n\n683\n00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.680\nI can see other data,\nlike my memory utilization, right?\n\n684\n00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.590\nWhere am I running at and notice how it's\nbreaking it down, the blue is active,\n\n685\n00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:37.550\nthat's the memory I'm using right now, the\ngray or green or whatever it is I shared.\n\n686\n00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:40.010\nThat's memory that's been\npromised to more than one host.\n\n687\n00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:41.370\nI've oversubscribed.\n\n688\n00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.800\nThe purple, that's ballooned memory,\nwhere we've already expanded.\n\n689\n00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.134\nAnd then, that pink is common memory.\n\n690\n00:31:47.134 --> 00:31:51.545\nCommon memory is used when you've\ngot pair of virtualization.\n\n691\n00:31:51.545 --> 00:31:55.911\nI might have five Linux VM's and\nthey're all sharing the same kernel.\n\n692\n00:31:55.911 --> 00:31:58.106\nBecause they're running\nthe exact same operating system,\n\n693\n00:31:58.106 --> 00:32:01.440\nmight as well share that kernel space and\nthat becomes shared memory between them.\n\n694\n00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.780\nYou can have all sorts of different\ntypes of memory in place.\n\n695\n00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.580\nAnd they've got overhead memory which is\nprobably the underlying hypervisor or\n\n696\n00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.070\nsomething that is consuming that.\n\n697\n00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.560\nAnd we can measure it and\nsee where we're at.\n\n698\n00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:17.500\nAnd we can see all this in a very easy\nportal, just quick, easy to view.\n\n699\n00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.560\nBut where the real advantage comes in is\nnot managing a host or even managing a VM,\n\n700\n00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.430\nlike here's the same output for\na particular virtual machine.\n\n701\n00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:28.016\nBut it's really cool when we're\nmonitoring, if I can find it here,\n\n702\n00:32:28.016 --> 00:32:29.334\na service.\n\n703\n00:32:29.334 --> 00:32:32.289\nAnd I showed a quick example\nof that in another episode but\n\n704\n00:32:32.289 --> 00:32:34.260\nthis one's a lot more complex.\n\n705\n00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.170\nNotice what we've got here.\n\n706\n00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.850\nWe've got a service and it's defined\naround some kind of entry virtual machine.\n\n707\n00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.300\nAnd the entry virtual machine is normally\nsome kind of load balancer or router.\n\n708\n00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.350\nSo traffic comes in to access my service,\n\n709\n00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:49.488\nit then hits load balancers,\nthey're distributed maybe geographically.\n\n710\n00:32:49.488 --> 00:32:52.730\nOne load balancer's here in the US,\none's in Europe and\n\n711\n00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.880\nonce it hits that, it then\ndistributes across my web front ends.\n\n712\n00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.370\nAnd user could be hitting web front\nends in any number of regions.\n\n713\n00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:03.060\nFrom there, this web front ends\nhit my switch fabric, right?\n\n714\n00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.950\nThe fiber optics switch\nfabric then gets to the SAN.\n\n715\n00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.880\nAnd on the back end we've got our SAN.\n\n716\n00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.040\nAnd we might have our database\nSAN as well as our webpages or\n\n717\n00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.320\nweb front end and so on.\n\n718\n00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.460\nAnd this is breaking down all\nthe different components in that mix.\n\n719\n00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.290\nThis is the service as a whole.\n\n720\n00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:23.760\nMy website might be driven by routers,\nSANs,\n\n721\n00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.640\nfiber optic switches, databases,\nweb applications, multiple web front ends,\n\n722\n00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.240\nmultiple database servers,\napplication servers.\n\n723\n00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.300\nAnd if any one of them breaks,\nthe whole service suffers.\n\n724\n00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.500\nAnd we need to be looking at it from\nthat big picture, service monitoring.\n\n725\n00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:43.090\nAnd third party software like this,\nlike Foglight, makes that really easy.\n\n726\n00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:44.100\nThe setup is a pain, right?\n\n727\n00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.200\nI mean you gotta tell it everything\nyou know about your service.\n\n728\n00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.370\nBut once it's in place, it can monitor it,\nand you really get that view,\n\n729\n00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.890\nand it's really powerful and cool stuff.\n\n730\n00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.880\nBut it also allows you to do testing, that\nyou can bring one of these nodes down.\n\n731\n00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.340\nAnd when that node goes offline,\nyou'll see it here and\n\n732\n00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:04.360\nyou can validate performance, how is\nperformance on these other hosts affected\n\n733\n00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.480\nwhen this one node goes down, right?\n\n734\n00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.820\nAnd you can measure that out, and\nthen you can use that to trend out.\n\n735\n00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.730\nAnd say okay, well if that was how I\nsuffered from one node going down,\n\n736\n00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.550\nnow I know how much I'd suffer if\ntwo went down, or three went down.\n\n737\n00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.050\nAnd you can figure out your tolerance.\n\n738\n00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:19.630\nTurns out I can only\nsurvive one node failure.\n\n739\n00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.960\nOkay, let me add some more nodes, so\nthat I can survive two node failures.\n\n740\n00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.070\nLet me bolster my environment\nto be able to support that.\n\n741\n00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:29.910\nYou've got to know where to strengthen\nyour system in order to keep it available.\n\n742\n00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:31.340\nSo that's definitely important.\n\n743\n00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.780\nThis is an application service.\n\n744\n00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.960\nAnd when we measure it this way,\n\n745\n00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.020\nwhat it's called is measuring\nthe application delivery, right?\n\n746\n00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.830\nWhat's the end user's experience?\n\n747\n00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.350\nWhen the end user comes to your web site,\n\n748\n00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.280\nthey really don't care what\nyour service is, right?\n\n749\n00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.480\nWhen the user logs into\nGmail they don't care\n\n750\n00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.150\nwhat Google is running under the hood or\nhow many servers.\n\n751\n00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:52.750\nThey just wanna know, hey I logged in I\ngot my mailbox I clicked on an email and\n\n752\n00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.220\nI saw it on the screen.\n\n753\n00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.990\nThey don't know that there might have been\nten different servers involved in that\n\n754\n00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.890\ncommunication.\n\n755\n00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.090\nThey don't care, right.\n\n756\n00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:00.100\nThey want that service delivery.\n\n757\n00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.970\nThey want to get the service\nthey are asking for and\n\n758\n00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:03.680\nget it promptly and reliably.\n\n759\n00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.980\n>> Very good.\nNow in some service monitoring,\n\n760\n00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.840\nthere are other things that we\nneed to pay attention to, right?\n\n761\n00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.152\nWe've talked about the services\nthemselves, the application delivery\n\n762\n00:35:12.152 --> 00:35:15.170\nnow Don we also have to worry about\nthings like security as well too.\n\n763\n00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.690\n>> Absolutely.\n\n764\n00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:17.860\nAnd penetration and vulnerability testing.\n\n765\n00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.630\nThose are the two big ones.\n\n766\n00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.110\nVulnerabilities, that's where we start,\nright?\n\n767\n00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:24.160\nA vulnerability is\na weakness in your system\n\n768\n00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.660\nthat's not necessarily been exploited.\n\n769\n00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.130\nOr not even necessarily exploitable,\nright?\n\n770\n00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:31.160\nIn theory, somebody could exploit it if\nthey knew about it, if they found it, and\n\n771\n00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.590\nthey got access to it.\n\n772\n00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:33.140\nIt's better for\n\n773\n00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.320\nyou to find that first than to let\nsomebody on the outside find it.\n\n774\n00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.960\nAnd so we need to be testing for that.\n\n775\n00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.170\nIf you're hosting your own cloud.\n\n776\n00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:41.030\nIf it's a private cloud,\n\n777\n00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:44.330\nyou're hosting all the equipment,\nit's up to you to test that.\n\n778\n00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:45.840\nIf you're up in Amazon AWS or\n\n779\n00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.320\nyou're up in Microsoft Azure, they're\ntaking care of it on the platform side.\n\n780\n00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.400\nBut it's still up to you\non the software side.\n\n781\n00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.730\nYou deploy your software into that\ncloud and it could be weak and so\n\n782\n00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:56.820\nit's up to you to maintain that.\n\n783\n00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.220\nSo you're never completely scot-free\nunless you do a completely hosted service,\n\n784\n00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.330\nlike Gmail, right?\n\n785\n00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:06.480\nIf we decide to use Google apps for\nbusiness then Google handles all that.\n\n786\n00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.900\nAnd we just browse to it and use it.\n\n787\n00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.930\nBut if it's our mail server or\nour file server running on somebody else's\n\n788\n00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.080\nplatform, we're still responsible for\nthe services.\n\n789\n00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.320\nSo we need to do vulnerability testing and\n\n790\n00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.340\npenetration testing is\nan extension of that.\n\n791\n00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.865\nPenetration testing is where you say can\nI use those vulnerabilities to get in?\n\n792\n00:36:22.865 --> 00:36:24.980\nCuz sometimes you might have\na vulnerability that's just not practical\n\n793\n00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.310\nfor somebody to use, since so\nyou don't have to worry about it so much.\n\n794\n00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:31.490\nBut penetration testing is where\nsomebody actively tries to use\n\n795\n00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:34.970\nthat vulnerability to get into\nthe system and access your data.\n\n796\n00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:37.260\nThere's plenty of, again,\nthird party sellers,\n\n797\n00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.490\nthere's plenty of contractors out\nthere that will do this for you.\n\n798\n00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:43.220\nYou can hire, you know, the good guys.\n\n799\n00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.780\nThe ethical hackers, to come in and\nevaluate your network and\n\n800\n00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.170\ngive you a security profile.\n\n801\n00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:49.920\nThere's plenty of people to do that,\nplenty of really good talent out there.\n\n802\n00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.000\nYou could also get software that does it.\n\n803\n00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.781\nMetasploit is a very common package\nthat you could scan all your systems and\n\n804\n00:36:55.781 --> 00:36:57.330\nit'll identify that.\n\n805\n00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:01.990\nA lot of the vendors, like Microsoft,\nhas the baseline security analyzer.\n\n806\n00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:03.940\nWhich, didn't they change the name for\nthat?\n\n807\n00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.980\nLike FCW or something now.\n\n808\n00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.920\n>> They might have, yeah.\n\n809\n00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.520\nI just know it as the MBSA.\n\n810\n00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.440\n>> Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer.\n\n811\n00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.210\nSo we can scan the systems with that.\n\n812\n00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.630\nVMWare, they don't really have\na whole lot for doing that.\n\n813\n00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:15.959\nVCenter has some basic stuff.\n\n814\n00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.080\nZensor, I don't think they\nhave anything for it either.\n\n815\n00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.440\nBut, third party software like Metasploit,\nyou can scan your systems.\n\n816\n00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.240\nIf there's vulnerabilities,\nit'll help you find it.\n\n817\n00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.670\nAnd then you can go in and correct those.\n\n818\n00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:26.990\nYou need to be doing those scans.\n\n819\n00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.840\nThat's just as important for\ntesting for failure, right?\n\n820\n00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.770\nWhat are the odds of you having a hard\ndrive failure or a power supply failure?\n\n821\n00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:34.320\nIt's pretty high.\n\n822\n00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.330\nIt happens, right?\n\n823\n00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:37.670\nAnd the more storage you have,\nthe more likely it's going to happen.\n\n824\n00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:41.170\nWhat are the odds of somebody trying to\nhack into your network That's a given.\n\n825\n00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:42.300\nIt's happening all the time.\n\n826\n00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.424\nIf you're service is internet connected,\nsomebody's gonna port scan you at least\n\n827\n00:37:45.424 --> 00:37:48.610\nonce a day, and so you need to make\nsure that you're protected from that.\n\n828\n00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.920\nThat's going to stop those types\nof attacks from happening or\n\n829\n00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.242\nfrom being able to get in and\n\n830\n00:37:52.242 --> 00:37:54.460\nto save you from a completely\ndifferent type of failure, right?\n\n831\n00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:57.410\nSo really important to do; penetration and\nvulnerability testing.\n\n832\n00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:01.030\nAnd the only other thing\nthat I want to mention here\n\n833\n00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:04.330\nis it's specifically on the exam\nobjectives is separation of duties.\n\n834\n00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:08.300\nWhen you're doing service testing,\nit's really important\n\n835\n00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:12.620\nthat you don't let the same person who\nmanages the service do the testing on it.\n\n836\n00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:13.130\nRight?\n\n837\n00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:14.590\nBecause they've set it up.\n\n838\n00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:17.460\nThey have a lot of knowledge on\nhow this thing's configured.\n\n839\n00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.960\nAnd they may just assume some things are\nsecure when they aren't or they might spot\n\n840\n00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.860\nvulnerabilities that they know because\nthey're the ones who set it up, but hey\n\n841\n00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.640\nhave information that an outside attacker\nwouldn't so if we have a secondary\n\n842\n00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.370\nparty do the scan, they're not biased in\nthat they didn't set the software up.\n\n843\n00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.650\nSo there's that piece, right?\n\n844\n00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:34.460\nThat helps.\n\n845\n00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:39.150\nAnd then, they don't have information\nthat an insider would necessarily have.\n\n846\n00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:43.590\nSo, using an outside contractor or just\nusing you know, different employees on\n\n847\n00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:46.295\nthe inside, the scan systems\nare not normally responsible for.\n\n848\n00:38:46.295 --> 00:38:50.060\nWill make sure that you've got that good\nseparation of duties, and you don't have\n\n849\n00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.410\npeople with a vested interest in saying\nsoftware is secure when it isn't.\n\n850\n00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.020\nWe'll want to make sure that we have an\nindependent body that's actually scanning\n\n851\n00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:56.650\nand studying that.\n\n852\n00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:59.590\n>> So that gets us closer to\nthe traditional black box testing\n\n853\n00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.470\nversus the white box.\n\n854\n00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:02.290\nDon't have any information\nabout the system,\n\n855\n00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.560\nor very little information\nabout the system.\n\n856\n00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.620\nSo you know that if they do make it in,\nthey've had to find out what everybody\n\n857\n00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.440\nelse could find out, and\nhow about the IT admin that says, yeah,\n\n858\n00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.930\nI was gonna fix that next week if that's\nthe same person that's doing the testing.\n\n859\n00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:17.540\n>> And it's still okay for\nthem to do the testing too, but\n\n860\n00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.890\nyou don't want them to be\nthe only ones doing the testing.\n\n861\n00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.620\nYou could have that disgruntled\ninternal employee anyway\n\n862\n00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.070\nwho would have that insider information\nthat's something to worry about.\n\n863\n00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.860\nBut you always want to\nhave that outside opinion.\n\n864\n00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.480\nAnd it doesn't necessarily have to\nbe somebody outside the company but\n\n865\n00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.690\noutside as far as the management\nof that software.\n\n866\n00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:36.240\n>> In optimizing and performance\nwe've looked at a lot of concepts.\n\n867\n00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:41.210\nRemember that, go back and review the\nfirst two portions, part one and part two.\n\n868\n00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:43.880\nThis is the part three we've\nlooked at our big four, right?\n\n869\n00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.850\nThe four horseman, CPU, we've looked at\nRAM, we've looked at our hard disc and,\n\n870\n00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:52.220\nwell disc storage if you will, and\nwe've also looked at networking.\n\n871\n00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.130\nWe've also looked at the services,\nyou know,\n\n872\n00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.870\nnot only the resource consumption but\nthe services that are provided.\n\n873\n00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:58.670\nDon, got anything else for us on this one?\n\n874\n00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:59.540\n>> That's about it.\n\n875\n00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.460\nNow some of the topics we talked about,\nlike redundancy,\n\n876\n00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.920\nwe are going to revisit in\nthe disaster recovery episodes.\n\n877\n00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.320\nSo be sure to check those out.\n\n878\n00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.170\nBut otherwise there is a lot to monitor,\n\n879\n00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:10.660\na lot of keep your thumb on\nthe pulse of your network.\n\n880\n00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.635\nYou got to keep an eye on all of it.\n\n881\n00:40:11.635 --> 00:40:13.905\nBecause any one piece could\ncause a cascading failure.\n\n882\n00:40:13.905 --> 00:40:15.845\n>> All right, well thank you for\nall that information.\n\n883\n00:40:15.845 --> 00:40:19.285\nIt looks like we've come to the end of\nanother exciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n884\n00:40:19.285 --> 00:40:21.595\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nsign off today.\n\n885\n00:40:21.595 --> 00:40:22.985\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n886\n00:40:22.985 --> 00:40:23.645\n>> And I'm Don Pizet.\n\n887\n00:40:23.645 --> 00:40:27.350\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n888\n00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:33.800\n>> [NOISE]\n\n",

Bryan,\n\n3\n00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:20.587\nand in today's episode we're going to be\nmoving along in our Cloud Plus series and\n\n4\n00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:23.951\nwe're gonna be looking at some\nBusiness continuity concepts.\n\n5\n00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:27.950\nIt is very, very important to make sure\nthat if something happens, right, some\n\n6\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.540\nkind of disaster happens to your company\nthat your company can survive that.\n\n7\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.870\nSo, today's episode is gonna be\nall about disaster recovery and\n\n8\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.690\nwe got none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet here to help us out.\n\n9\n00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.940\nDon, how are you doing today sir?\n\n10\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.100\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.891\nReady to face disaster with optimism and\n[LAUGH] jump into this.\n\n12\n00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:47.145\nWe are gonna focus a little\nbit on concepts and\n\n13\n00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:50.822\ntheory here in the beginning but then\nI want to show you guys some practical\n\n14\n00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:54.170\nexamples of how we can build\ndisaster recovery into our solution.\n\n15\n00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.633\nAnd the key thing here is that when\na failure occurs inside of your cloud it\n\n16\n00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:01.134\nshouldn't down your service, right?\n\n17\n00:01:01.134 --> 00:01:04.142\nThe whole point of having a cloud is\nhaving all of these amazing resources at\n\n18\n00:01:04.142 --> 00:01:05.270\nyour disposal.\n\n19\n00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.180\nAnd they are if you know how to use\nthem and if you take advantage of them.\n\n20\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.190\nIf you don't,\n\n21\n00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.530\nyour system is just as weak in the cloud\nas it would be on physical servers.\n\n22\n00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.670\nYou can still have similar\npoints of failure and\n\n23\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.680\nyou've got to plan around that and\noptimize your network.\n\n24\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.010\nSo we're gonna get\na chance to see that and\n\n25\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.260\nI'll just show you a few different\nexamples that are out there.\n\n26\n00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.660\nBut there's tons of different ways to do\nit if you just take the time to figure out\n\n27\n00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.040\nwhat are the capabilities of your system,\nso that's what we're gonna look at here.\n\n28\n00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.630\n>> You know, one of the things that comes\nto mind right away is well you know I\n\n29\n00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.880\ncould always pay two providers.\n\n30\n00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.320\nI could have a single cloud provider, and\nthen you know if I need fail override,\n\n31\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.030\nI could have another cloud provider.\n\n32\n00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.070\nWhy wouldn't that work?\n\n33\n00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.770\nAnd the first thing that\ncomes to mind on that one\n\n34\n00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.780\nis just the sheer expense of that.\n\n35\n00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.990\n>> Well, and for\nsome people it's worth it.\n\n36\n00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.070\nThink Apple, right?\n\n37\n00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.120\nSo Apple has their iCloud service.\n\n38\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.820\nAnd if you use iCloud,\nyou just see it as one service.\n\n39\n00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.530\nBut on the backend,\n\n40\n00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.690\nApple doesn't have a data center\nbig enough to power iCloud, yet.\n\n41\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.070\nApparently they're building them, right?\n\n42\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.420\nThose giant spaceship things.\n\n43\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.040\nBut, for now iCloud resides entirely on\nAmazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure.\n\n44\n00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.850\nThey've split it across the two providers.\n\n45\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.520\nAnd that way if Amazon completely fails,\nthey just flip right over to Azure.\n\n46\n00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.980\nAnd if Azure completely fails,\n\n47\n00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.670\nthey'd flip right over to Amazon and\nthey can disperse across both of them.\n\n48\n00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.860\nYou can achieve those, plenty of\nindependent companies who do that.\n\n49\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.420\nOr you can do a hybrid of your own, where\npart of your service runs up in Azure and\n\n50\n00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.580\nthe other part runs on your local\nservers right in the facility with you.\n\n51\n00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.500\nThat's perfectly fine, right?\n\n52\n00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.620\nYou could even do it where\nit wasn't that complex.\n\n53\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.320\nWhere 100% of your infrastructure\nrun in the building with you.\n\n54\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.200\nBut then you had replicas store up in\na cloud somewhere that you can spin up\n\n55\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.110\nwhen needed.\n\n56\n00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.980\nSo for example Microsoft has their\nMicrosoft Azure Site Recovery product\n\n57\n00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.680\nwhere you run all your servers and\nyour cloud locally.\n\n58\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.870\nYou have a private cloud,\nyour own systems.\n\n59\n00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.570\nAnd then you back it up to them.\n\n60\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.150\nAnd the cool part about this is when you\nback up to them, your servers aren't\n\n61\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.240\nactually running up Azure,\nit's really just storing copies of them.\n\n62\n00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.070\nAnd if you ever have a failure locally,\nif your servers die or\n\n63\n00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.060\nyour whole facility gets destroyed,\nyou just reach out to Azure.\n\n64\n00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.930\nYou log into their website and\nyou activate your site recovery.\n\n65\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.470\nAnd it turns on.\n\n66\n00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.914\nAll your servers come up in Azure, and\nyou're in the cloud, you're out there in\n\n67\n00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:12.225\nthe public cloud and your systems are back\non line just like that, all right.\n\n68\n00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:17.400\nThis is a way we can leverage cloud\nservices to achieve an off site back up.\n\n69\n00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.870\nAnd, we've done this for years, when you\nhad physical service you backed the tape,\n\n70\n00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.520\nyou had the tapes, and\nyou shipped them offsite somewhere, right?\n\n71\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.800\nAnd when a failure happened,\nwhat did you have to do?\n\n72\n00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.011\nYou had to call whoever\nwas storing you tapes and\n\n73\n00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:29.360\nsay, I need to get those tapes back.\n\n74\n00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.810\nAnd an hour or two later they come driving\nup, and here's your tapes back, and\n\n75\n00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.280\nnow you get to start restoring them.\n\n76\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.204\nBut if your site was destroyed,\nwhat are you restoring to?\n\n77\n00:03:36.204 --> 00:03:38.230\nNot that site.\n\n78\n00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.420\nYou've got to go get a new building.\n\n79\n00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.750\nYou've got to go get new servers.\n\n80\n00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.300\nYou've got to get new racks.\n\n81\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.230\nThere's all sorts of stuff.\n\n82\n00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.961\nSo an offsite backup is good, but it's\ngonna take a long time to recover, right?\n\n83\n00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.261\nBecause you've got to get a new facility,\nand that's a lot of work.\n\n84\n00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:53.943\nWell, you can have remote locations\nthat are already ready for\n\n85\n00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:57.916\nyou like a hot site or cold site or\nwhatever but those are expensive.\n\n86\n00:03:57.916 --> 00:04:02.209\nLeveraging a cloud like this, we get that\nprotection and we get replication of\n\n87\n00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.648\nvirtual machines so we can spin-up our\nVM's in the cloud in a moment's notice.\n\n88\n00:04:06.648 --> 00:04:09.900\nThe hardwares, they're waiting for\nus, so we're not paying for it.\n\n89\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.800\nCuz with the cloud service like this,\nyou only pay for what you use.\n\n90\n00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.770\nSo its a great way to mix the two\ntechnologies to create a hybrid\n\n91\n00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.813\na solution, right?\n\n92\n00:04:16.813 --> 00:04:20.641\nNow there's challenges with this, but I'm\ngoing to talk about it as we go through\n\n93\n00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:23.230\nthe series,\nlike how replication and so on.\n\n94\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.769\nBut the idea of having that offsite\nbackup is really, really valuable.\n\n95\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.210\nThe first concept I want to talk about\nthough when we start to use a service like\n\n96\n00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.900\nthis is what's called our RTO and\nRPO, our recovery time objective,\n\n97\n00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.780\nand our recovery point objective.\n\n98\n00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.480\nWhen you have a failure on the network,\n\n99\n00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.280\nhow long does it take you\nto get back online again?\n\n100\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.960\nMy recovery time.\n\n101\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.150\nSo if I've got a network\nthat I'm doing backups.\n\n102\n00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.330\nNotice here, I've got kind of a full\nback up happening Monday at midnight.\n\n103\n00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.950\nAnd then at 6 AM we're doing\na differential back up, and\n\n104\n00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.180\nthen at noon we do a differential back up,\nand\n\n105\n00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.160\nthen at 6 PM we do a differential back up,\nand then at midnight we do another full.\n\n106\n00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.040\nSo that's my backup schedule.\n\n107\n00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.040\nSo I'm doing a backup every six hours,\nand if I have a failure.\n\n108\n00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.480\nSo let's say that\nthe network goes down and\n\n109\n00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.660\nI have a failure right\nhere at 23:00 hours.\n\n110\n00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.980\nSo at 11pm I have a failure.\n\n111\n00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.380\nWell when that happens how long\ndoes it take me to restore?\n\n112\n00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.330\nIf I've got to call somebody from\noffsite to bring me my tapes, and\n\n113\n00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.390\nthen I've got to get the tapes and start\nrunning the restore process, it might take\n\n114\n00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.120\nme an hour to get the tapes, it might\ntake me an hour to prepare a new servers.\n\n115\n00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.670\nIt might take another two\nhours to restore from tape, so\n\n116\n00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.550\nnow I've got a four hour window that it\ntook me to get those servers back online.\n\n117\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.170\nThat's my recovery time objective,\nmy RTO, all right.\n\n118\n00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.660\nNow If I had used something like Azure's\nsite recovery, I have a failure.\n\n119\n00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.180\nI log into Azure's web portal,\nI activate those servers.\n\n120\n00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.100\nMy recovery time is five minutes,\nten minutes.\n\n121\n00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.160\nWhatever it takes for\nme to see the problem and then go and\n\n122\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.500\nclick the button, right?\n\n123\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.880\nSo you can shrink that RTO really small.\n\n124\n00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.520\nNow what is your RTO?\n\n125\n00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.760\nThe short answer is I don't know.\n\n126\n00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.750\nAnd the long answer might be that\nyou don't know either, right?\n\n127\n00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.700\nIt's not normally something\nthe IT guy determines.\n\n128\n00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.030\nAs an IT guy, we know the minimum RTO.\n\n129\n00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.570\nI know the minimum amount of time it's\ngonna take me to bring the system back up.\n\n130\n00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.470\nSo if I know I'm going to have to go to\ntape, I know this is going to be a minimum\n\n131\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.850\nof four hours and\nit could be longer if I have problems.\n\n132\n00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.350\nMaybe I have a bad tape, and\nnow I've got to deal with that.\n\n133\n00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.150\nSo it could be even longer.\n\n134\n00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.100\nI just know the minimum, right?\n\n135\n00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.660\nThe maximum, that's going to be\ndetermined by your executives.\n\n136\n00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.120\nThe people who run your business.\n\n137\n00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.880\nSo for example, I used to work for a bank.\n\n138\n00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.280\nAnd we were FDIC insured.\n\n139\n00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.289\nAnd the FDIC had this rule, and\n\n140\n00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.627\nit said that your bank could not\nbe closed for more than 72 hours.\n\n141\n00:06:45.627 --> 00:06:50.450\nAnd that meant three days,\nwe could be closed for three days.\n\n142\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.320\nSo if I had a failure,\nif a system went down, I had three days,\n\n143\n00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.700\nthat timer started clicking.\n\n144\n00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.580\nAnd if we were still closed at the end\nof three days, the FDIC would come and\n\n145\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.340\ntake us over.\n\n146\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.407\nThey would take over operations\nof your bank, right?\n\n147\n00:07:02.407 --> 00:07:05.150\nSo that was our window,\nthat's what we had.\n\n148\n00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.460\nNow, I knew my RTO was\nreally like four hours.\n\n149\n00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.540\nI can get the system back on very,\nvery quickly.\n\n150\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.618\nWe didn't need 72 hours, but\nthat was the window we had.\n\n151\n00:07:13.618 --> 00:07:18.310\nSo your RTO is really going to be\ndetermined by your governing policies,\n\n152\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.310\nwhatever it is that dictates how\nyour company does business and\n\n153\n00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.130\nit's usually the executives.\n\n154\n00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.270\nWe need to plan our backup\ntechnologies around that.\n\n155\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.810\nIf your RTO is 15 minutes,\nhey this is a mission critical service,\n\n156\n00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.290\nmaybe it's a hospital right, and\nit's doling out medications and\n\n157\n00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.680\nit can't be down more than 15 minutes,\ncan you use back up tapes?\n\n158\n00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.835\nNo you can't even use index a back\nup tape in 15 minutes better yet\n\n159\n00:07:38.835 --> 00:07:39.576\nrestore data from it.\n\n160\n00:07:39.576 --> 00:07:42.791\nSo tape's just out of the picture, right?\n\n161\n00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:46.770\nAzure Site Recovery though,\nyou could spin it up in moments, right?\n\n162\n00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.300\nAnd I use Azure Site Recover, we could\nuse Amazon Web Services, or Rackspace, or\n\n163\n00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.720\nany any number of\ndifferent systems to do it.\n\n164\n00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.828\nWe could use our own\nprivate systems to do it.\n\n165\n00:07:52.828 --> 00:07:56.671\nHaving that replica somewhere that\nwe can spin up at a moment's notice,\n\n166\n00:07:56.671 --> 00:07:59.067\nthat's how we get a 15 minute RTO, right?\n\n167\n00:07:59.067 --> 00:08:02.282\nSo we've gotta plan for\nthat recovery time objective.\n\n168\n00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:05.269\nThe other concept that goes\nhand in hand with this is RPO,\n\n169\n00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:07.540\nrecovery point objective.\n\n170\n00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.140\nWhen I have a failure,\nI'm gonna lose data, that happens, right?\n\n171\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.200\nA failure means lost data.\n\n172\n00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.876\nIt might be very small amount of data or\nit might be a very big amount of data, and\n\n173\n00:08:18.876 --> 00:08:21.683\nit's up to how we've set our\nbackups up to determine that.\n\n174\n00:08:21.683 --> 00:08:24.459\nSo for example,\nlooking at this model here,\n\n175\n00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:27.026\nI took a full backup at midnight, right?\n\n176\n00:08:27.026 --> 00:08:30.026\nSo nice full backup\nright here at midnight.\n\n177\n00:08:30.026 --> 00:08:31.999\nAnd then at 6 AM, I did a differential.\n\n178\n00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:33.589\nAnd what does a differential do?\n\n179\n00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:34.901\nIt gets the changes, right?\n\n180\n00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:37.085\nWhat's changed since midnight?\n\n181\n00:08:37.085 --> 00:08:38.605\nAnd then I do a backup at noon.\n\n182\n00:08:38.605 --> 00:08:40.770\nAnd again, it's a differential.\n\n183\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.050\nSo what's changed since midnight?\n\n184\n00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.750\nAnd then I do a back up at 6 PM, another\ndifferential, what's changed since noon?\n\n185\n00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.850\nEach back up is getting bigger and\n\n186\n00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.520\nbigger because they're getting\nwhat's changed since then.\n\n187\n00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.210\nWhen I have a failure, so\na failure right here at 11 PM.\n\n188\n00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.000\nI can go and\nI can restore the full back up.\n\n189\n00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.880\nAnd I can restore the latest differential,\ncuz it includes all these changes too, so\n\n190\n00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.110\nI just restored this latest one.\n\n191\n00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.450\nAnd now I'm restored and\nI'm back online, right?\n\n192\n00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.490\nNot really,\nI'm restored to how things were at 6 PM.\n\n193\n00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.330\nThe failure happened at 11 PM.\n\n194\n00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.530\nSo we went from 1800 hours to 1100 hours,\nright, so\n\n195\n00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.410\nyou get a difference of three hours.\n\n196\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.549\nThat doesn't work out, does it?\n\n197\n00:09:25.549 --> 00:09:29.902\n6 PM to 11 PM,\nthat should be five hours, right?\n\n198\n00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:31.283\nThere's some crazy bad math here.\n\n199\n00:09:31.283 --> 00:09:36.506\nWell, 2300 minus 1800 is, well apparently\nI stink at math, but it's five hours.\n\n200\n00:09:36.506 --> 00:09:39.409\nSo five hours of data that I lost there,\nright?\n\n201\n00:09:39.409 --> 00:09:42.050\nWhere did that five hours of data go?\n\n202\n00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.870\nIt's gone, it's not in the backup tape,\nthat happened five hours ago.\n\n203\n00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.040\nSo, this five hours of data is now gone.\n\n204\n00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.350\nIs that bad?\n\n205\n00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.460\nI don't know, right?\n\n206\n00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.250\nIf it's my personal email, I could\nstand to loose five hours of email.\n\n207\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.811\nI actually kind of like that.\n\n208\n00:09:56.811 --> 00:09:58.780\n[LAUGH] I get too much email as it is.\n\n209\n00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.140\nBut if this is medical records,\nfinancial data,\n\n210\n00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.250\ndo you want to lose five\nhours worth of sales?\n\n211\n00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.350\nMaybe you're Amazon, Amazon.com, they do\nover a million dollars in sales per hour.\n\n212\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.250\nSo do you want to lose five hours?\n\n213\n00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.090\nThat's a lot of money, in that scenario,\n\n214\n00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.800\nyour recovery point objective\nneeds to be very, very small.\n\n215\n00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.060\nAnd so they might be taking\nbackups every 15 minutes,\n\n216\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.730\nthey might be taking\nbackups every 5 minutes.\n\n217\n00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.540\nThey might be doing constant backups,\nwhich are replicas.\n\n218\n00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.600\nI'm replicating my data\nto another location so\n\n219\n00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.400\nif I have a failure, I'm in lockstep,\nI can get that replica, and\n\n220\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.560\nI'll show you an example how to do\nthat a little bit later in the series.\n\n221\n00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.360\nBut if my data is that sensitive,\nI'm gonna need to do that.\n\n222\n00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.200\nAnd that type of offering is pretty\ndifficult to build, pretty complex, but\n\n223\n00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.570\nI'll show you cloud services\nmake that a lot easier and\n\n224\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.000\nit actually becomes super easy, all right?\n\n225\n00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.750\nBut my data might not be that sensitive.\n\n226\n00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.250\nHeck, I might not care, I might be able\nto afford losing 24 hours of data and\n\n227\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.720\nso I might say, you know what, I'm not\neven gonna do these backups, forget that,\n\n228\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.820\nI'll just do a full backup every night.\n\n229\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:03.840\nIf I do a full backup at midnight and\nI have a failure at 11 PM,\n\n230\n00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.540\nI just lost 23 hours of data.\n\n231\n00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.930\nBut that might be okay.\n\n232\n00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.730\nMy company might be okay with\nlosing 23 hours of data.\n\n233\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.603\nMaybe we've got paper receipts anyway and\nwe can just go and get those and\n\n234\n00:11:13.603 --> 00:11:16.067\nhave somebody do data entry,\nput it back in and you're done.\n\n235\n00:11:16.067 --> 00:11:19.451\nIf you're a small dentist office or\nsomething like that,\n\n236\n00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:24.020\nyou can rebuild your records pretty easy,\nthis model might work fine for you.\n\n237\n00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.910\nBut it might not, and so you've gotta\nplan your backup solution around that.\n\n238\n00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:32.020\nSo understanding your RTO,\nhow long do you have to recover, and\n\n239\n00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:36.180\nyour RPO, how much data you can afford\nto lose, that's really important.\n\n240\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.920\nYou need to know those two concepts and\nunderstand what your company can tolerate,\n\n241\n00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.960\neverybody's company is different.\n\n242\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.200\nOn the exam, you just need to know\nwhat those concepts are, in real life,\n\n243\n00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.576\nyou've gotta define them and\nthat's a lot more challenging.\n\n244\n00:11:46.576 --> 00:11:51.221\n>> Would it be fair to say Don in this\none question I was thinking about that\n\n245\n00:11:51.221 --> 00:11:55.650\nthe RPO basically starts with\nthe last time you took a full backup?\n\n246\n00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:00.894\n>> In this model, yes, but your RPO,\nif I had all these other backups, right?\n\n247\n00:12:00.894 --> 00:12:03.331\nYour RPO, it starts ticking from\nwhenever your last backup was.\n\n248\n00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:04.551\n>> Gotcha.\n\n249\n00:12:04.551 --> 00:12:06.786\n>> So it might be from here\nthat it starts kind of ticking.\n\n250\n00:12:06.786 --> 00:12:10.850\nNow you know those kind of terms there,\n\n251\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:14.080\nwe actually have some other terms to\nthrow in that kind of cover that.\n\n252\n00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.120\nYou might hear MTBF and MTTR, okay?\n\n253\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.010\nMTTR is what Wes wass talking about.\n\n254\n00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.255\nThat's the mean time to restore.\n\n255\n00:12:22.255 --> 00:12:26.265\nSo when a failure happens, my RTO\nkicks in, my recovery time objective.\n\n256\n00:12:26.265 --> 00:12:28.947\nIf it's 72 hours, it kicks in.\n\n257\n00:12:28.947 --> 00:12:31.300\nI've got 72 hours to get this done.\n\n258\n00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.690\nBut how long's it gonna\nactually take me to recover?\n\n259\n00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.920\nThat's the mean time to restore, right?\n\n260\n00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.208\nHow long does it take to\nrestore services on my system.\n\n261\n00:12:38.208 --> 00:12:43.000\nI might have a 72 hour RTO, but\nI might have a 4 hour MTTR, right?\n\n262\n00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.710\nI know that it takes me\nabout four hours to recover.\n\n263\n00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.205\nNow how do I know it takes\nme four hours to recover?\n\n264\n00:12:48.205 --> 00:12:50.928\nWe test, you've gotta test your backup and\nrecovery.\n\n265\n00:12:50.928 --> 00:12:54.940\nAnd MTTR, the mean part at the beginning,\nit doesn't mean it's angry.\n\n266\n00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.190\nIt means that we're taking an average.\n\n267\n00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:02.400\nAnd what you do is you take the length\nof your previous restores and\n\n268\n00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.420\nyou divide that by the amount\nof restores you've done.\n\n269\n00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.240\nYou're basically averaging it out to\nfind out what the average amount of\n\n270\n00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.180\ntime to restore.\n\n271\n00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.440\nSo if I've done five tests and it took\nme six hours, six hours, four hours,\n\n272\n00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.780\ntwo hours, two hours.\n\n273\n00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.364\nThat's gonna average out to four hours.\n\n274\n00:13:16.364 --> 00:13:19.850\nMy average MTTR is four hours, right?\n\n275\n00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.330\nThat's my mean time.\n\n276\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.750\nBut If I actually have a failure,\nit might not be four hours.\n\n277\n00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:26.430\nIt might be six hours.\n\n278\n00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.070\nIt might be two but\n\n279\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.880\nI know that typically it's gonna\nbe in that four hour range, right?\n\n280\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.350\nThat's your MTTR.\n\n281\n00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.778\nThe RTO starts ticking right away.\n\n282\n00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:35.471\nThe MTTR really is being\naffected right away and\n\n283\n00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:38.176\nthose two numbers might be different,\nright?\n\n284\n00:13:38.176 --> 00:13:39.770\nMTBF is another one that's kind of fun.\n\n285\n00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.790\nIt's mean time between failures.\n\n286\n00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.830\nI know what you're thinking.\n\n287\n00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.870\nA lot of people say mean\ntime before failure.\n\n288\n00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.610\nThe official definition is\nmean time between failure and\n\n289\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:49.900\nthat's how you'll see it on the exam.\n\n290\n00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.820\nMake sure you do it right.\n\n291\n00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.630\nThat is how you long you're gonna expect\na system to run before it has a failure.\n\n292\n00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.637\nAnd the way you calculate that is\nyou simply add up your uptime, so\n\n293\n00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:02.427\nhow long my system has been online, and\nyou divide that by the number of failures.\n\n294\n00:14:02.427 --> 00:14:06.858\nSo if my systems been on for eight months\nand I've had four failures in those eight\n\n295\n00:14:06.858 --> 00:14:09.790\nmonths, even if they all\nhappened in the last month,\n\n296\n00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.419\nthen that would average\nout to a two month MTBF.\n\n297\n00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:16.170\nThat I should expect to be able to run\ntwo months before having a failure.\n\n298\n00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.460\nAnd it's just kind of a ballpark number.\n\n299\n00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.199\nBut it gives you a way to say I can\nexpect to have failures this often and\n\n300\n00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:25.828\nI need to make sure that my recovery\nsolution is built around that.\n\n301\n00:14:25.828 --> 00:14:26.480\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n302\n00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.647\nI was gonna say with the mean\ntime between failures,\n\n303\n00:14:28.647 --> 00:14:31.061\nmaybe some of you guys are coming\nover from A+ saying hey,\n\n304\n00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:33.870\nI want to get into the Cloud+ series and\nlearn about that.\n\n305\n00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.152\nHard drives, if you've never seen\na mean time between failure,\n\n306\n00:14:37.152 --> 00:14:39.968\ncheck out some of the fine\nprint on you're hard drives.\n\n307\n00:14:39.968 --> 00:14:45.701\nHow many thousands of hours that they\nballpark average, just like Don said,\n\n308\n00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:50.034\nbefore they expect that that\ndrive should probably fail.\n\n309\n00:14:50.034 --> 00:14:52.850\nAnd that could be whether\nyou buy that drive or not.\n\n310\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.800\nSo that's where we see\na comment on hardware.\n\n311\n00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.948\n>> And in an even more obvious way,\njust look at the warranty.\n\n312\n00:14:56.948 --> 00:14:57.564\n>> There you go.\n\n313\n00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:59.143\n>> Some hard drives have\na three year warranty.\n\n314\n00:14:59.143 --> 00:15:00.877\nSome hard drives have a one year warranty.\n\n315\n00:15:00.877 --> 00:15:03.770\nWhat does that say about the hard\ndrive with a one year warranty?\n\n316\n00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.400\nIt's not made to last three years, right?\n\n317\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.590\n[LAUGH] If it was made\nto last three years,\n\n318\n00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.080\nthey'd give you a three year warranty.\n\n319\n00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.390\nSo you can kind of look at that, too.\n\n320\n00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.310\nBut just because it has a warranty,\nit doesn't mean it's safe.\n\n321\n00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.957\nAnd I think of that quote from Tommy Boy\nright here but we won't do that one.\n\n322\n00:15:14.957 --> 00:15:18.020\nBut anyhow, so those are some terms,\nsome concepts,\n\n323\n00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.091\nsome terminology that you'll see.\n\n324\n00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:21.770\nThe terminology is important for the exam.\n\n325\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.500\nIn real life, we don't necessarily care\nabout the terms as much as we care about\n\n326\n00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.920\nthe time that we have, right?\n\n327\n00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.720\nYou need the plan for\nthis information, and\n\n328\n00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.010\nthe solutions that you choose\nneed to fit that, right?\n\n329\n00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.440\nSo let's talk about how we plan for that.\n\n330\n00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.295\nOne of the first things we need to\nidentify is that in our cloud, you're\n\n331\n00:15:37.295 --> 00:15:42.350\ngonna have mission critical resources and\nnon-mission critical resources, right?\n\n332\n00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:47.450\nI might have a Active Directory domain\ncontroller or a MySQL database or\n\n333\n00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:52.467\nsome kind of email server and\nthese might be mission critical things.\n\n334\n00:15:52.467 --> 00:15:55.715\nI need these to be functioning for\nmy company to work.\n\n335\n00:15:55.715 --> 00:15:56.991\nIf one of these servers went down,\n\n336\n00:15:56.991 --> 00:15:59.279\nmy employees would be sitting\nthere twiddling their thumbs.\n\n337\n00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:01.519\nOr my customers wouldn't be able\nto conduct business with me.\n\n338\n00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:04.061\nThe business would be shut down,\nthat's critical.\n\n339\n00:16:04.061 --> 00:16:06.279\nThat's a mission critical\npiece of infrastructure.\n\n340\n00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:09.137\nThose, need to have very short RTO's.\n\n341\n00:16:09.137 --> 00:16:11.378\nThey need to be able to come\nback online very, very quickly.\n\n342\n00:16:11.378 --> 00:16:12.250\nRight?\n\n343\n00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.890\nAnd then,\nI might have non mission critical things.\n\n344\n00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.740\nI might have test and dev environments for\nthe production team or the dev team.\n\n345\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:18.370\nRight?\n\n346\n00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.670\nIf I don't get those back on line,\nthe dev team might not be able to work,\n\n347\n00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.340\nbut the whole rest of the company can.\n\n348\n00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.790\nWe can generate revenue.\n\n349\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.360\nRight.\n\n350\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.610\nSo you need to identify in your cloud,\nwhat's critical and what's not.\n\n351\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.660\nAnd that's important because if you're\nusing something like Azure Site Recovery,\n\n352\n00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.480\nI'm backing up my servers\nto VM's up in the cloud.\n\n353\n00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.210\nI might not want to back\nup every single system.\n\n354\n00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.050\nI might just want to do\nthe critical servers.\n\n355\n00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.170\nAnd that way, when a failure happens,\n\n356\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.620\nI can spin up those\ncritical ones right away.\n\n357\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.680\nAnd the noncritical ones, I can take my\ntime and I can bring back those online.\n\n358\n00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.660\nSo, I've satisfied my RTO.\n\n359\n00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.012\nI'm back online in that Window,\nbut I'm not 100%.\n\n360\n00:16:51.012 --> 00:16:54.040\nI still have my dev environment to\nrecover, or my staging environment\n\n361\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.620\nto recover, or these other non critical\nservers that are nice to have, but\n\n362\n00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.560\nI haven't brought back online yet, but\n\n363\n00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.280\nit's okay because the core\nbusiness functions are back up.\n\n364\n00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.500\nSo we've gotta identify those.\n\n365\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.700\nIdentify your mission critical resources.\n\n366\n00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.554\nWe also then have to think about\nredundancy and fall tolerance.\n\n367\n00:17:10.554 --> 00:17:11.140\nRight?\n\n368\n00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.500\nThose two terms,\nredundancy and fault tolerance.\n\n369\n00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.070\nThose are kind of important, right?\n\n370\n00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:18.240\nThey kind of go hand in hand, because\nthey're talking about the same thing.\n\n371\n00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.830\nIf I have a failure,\n\n372\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:24.470\nhow can I make sure that the system\ncontinues to function, right?\n\n373\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.710\nSo the key to remember on the exam is\nthat redundancy and fault tolerance,\n\n374\n00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.349\nthey kind of go hand in hand, but\nthey are two different things.\n\n375\n00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:35.260\nRedundancy, just means\nthat if I have a failure,\n\n376\n00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.480\nI've got something that\ncan take its place, right?\n\n377\n00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.937\nWhen I think of redundancy,\nI think of the spare tire in your car.\n\n378\n00:17:39.937 --> 00:17:43.130\nYou are driving down the Interstate,\nyou hit a nail, you pop a tire.\n\n379\n00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.530\nYou pull over to the side of the road,\nyou open your trunk and\n\n380\n00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.630\nthere's your redundant tire,\nright in your trunk.\n\n381\n00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.340\nYou take it out, you put it on your\ncar and you are back on the road,\n\n382\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.990\nafter 15 minutes, you had to pull over,\nyou had to change out the tire, right?\n\n383\n00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.820\nBut then, you are ready to go,\nyour redundant tire was nice but\n\n384\n00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.778\nit didn't stop you from having\nthe failure, you had to pull over,\n\n385\n00:18:01.778 --> 00:18:05.750\nyou had to take 15 minutes out of your\ntime, your trip just got longer, right?\n\n386\n00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:06.760\nThat's what redundancy does.\n\n387\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.127\nRedundancy allows you to quickly\nrecover from the failure,\n\n388\n00:18:10.127 --> 00:18:15.600\nit doesn't stop the failure from happening\nand it doesn't make the failure invisible.\n\n389\n00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.260\nYou know the failure was there,\nyou saw it, but\n\n390\n00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.080\nyou had a redundant system available.\n\n391\n00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:25.060\nHigh availability though and\nfault tolerance, that's a different story.\n\n392\n00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.020\nWith high availability or\n\n393\n00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.260\nfault tolerance, now we have with\na failure becomes invisible.\n\n394\n00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.850\nThe next time your driving down the\ninterstate look at the big semi trailers\n\n395\n00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.300\nthat are driving,\nyou look at their trailer and\n\n396\n00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.850\nyou'll see they don't just have more than\none tire, they have multiple tires stuck\n\n397\n00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.290\ntogether in separate sets and so,\nthey can get a flat tire and keep driving.\n\n398\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.520\nThey're not supposed to,\nbut they can, right?\n\n399\n00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.480\nAnd on your server, you might have\na RAID 5 array of hard drives and\n\n400\n00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.410\none hard drive fails, but\nyou keep driving, you keep going, right?\n\n401\n00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:57.020\nYou're able to rebuild that drive\nfrom parity and keep functioning.\n\n402\n00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.250\nThat failure becomes invisible.\n\n403\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.330\nThe end users stay in your system,\nthey keep working.\n\n404\n00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.170\nThat is what fault tolerance does,\nthat's what high availability does.\n\n405\n00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.040\nAnd it's a lot harder to do that.\n\n406\n00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.090\nHow can I make my system have\na failure and keep on running?\n\n407\n00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.640\nRight, how can I make it invisible?\n\n408\n00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.100\nThat's a lot harder than,\nhow can I have redundancy?\n\n409\n00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.610\nRedundancy's easy,\nyou just buy two of stuff, right?\n\n410\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.960\nI want redundant networking,\njust buy two network cards.\n\n411\n00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.950\nI want redundant server,\njust by a second one.\n\n412\n00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.820\nVery, very easy, right,\nyou throw money at the problem.\n\n413\n00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.190\nHigh availability,\nthat takes planning, right?\n\n414\n00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.410\nI don't want just two network cards, I\nwant to bond them together, so they appear\n\n415\n00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.184\nas one and if one fails, the other\none keeps on running, nobody notices.\n\n416\n00:19:33.184 --> 00:19:34.258\nRight?\n\n417\n00:19:34.258 --> 00:19:37.379\nIf I want a redundant servers, I've gotta\nhave a [INAUDIBLE] with shared stores, so\n\n418\n00:19:37.379 --> 00:19:40.160\nthat if one fails, the other one can\ntake over and have access to it.\n\n419\n00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.120\nI need to synchronize RAM between\nthe systems, so what's in RAM on one is\n\n420\n00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.270\non the other, so when a failure happens,\nthe other one takes right over.\n\n421\n00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.220\nNothing noticed on the network.\n\n422\n00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.000\nThat takes planning, right?\n\n423\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.270\nEspecially, if we're trying\nto do Geo redundancy, right?\n\n424\n00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.670\nI don't just want redundancy here in my\nbuilding, I want a completely separate\n\n425\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.240\nbuilding, somewhere else in\na different geographic location.\n\n426\n00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.980\nSo, if there's a hurricane here in\nFlorida, I can flip over to recovery\n\n427\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.320\ncenter that's somewhere where\nthey don't have hurricanes.\n\n428\n00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:07.880\nRight?\n\n429\n00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.220\nOr, if I'm in Seattle and\nI'm worried about an earthquake,\n\n430\n00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.760\nI want a fail somewhere else on a\ndifferent tectonic plate, where they might\n\n431\n00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.920\nhave an earthquake, but it would be\na different earthquake than mine.\n\n432\n00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.554\nI don't want one earthquake to\naffect both systems, right?\n\n433\n00:20:19.554 --> 00:20:20.800\nThat takes planning.\n\n434\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.950\nThat takes a lot of work,right?\n\n435\n00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.760\nAnd that's high availability and\nfull tolerance, right?\n\n436\n00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.140\nTwo different concepts.\n\n437\n00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.050\nBut they go hand in hand and\nwe normally do both.\n\n438\n00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.490\nIt's a rare server that doesn't\nhave two power supplies in it.\n\n439\n00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.350\nAnd when one power supply fails, the other\none just takes over, and that's it.\n\n440\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.050\nIt's a rare server that has less\nthan two network cards in it.\n\n441\n00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.390\nBut those network cards\naren't bonded by default.\n\n442\n00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:41.960\nThey're not configured for\nfault tolerance.\n\n443\n00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.690\nThey're configured as two network cards,\nand it's up to you to configure them for\n\n444\n00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:45.700\nfault tolerance.\n\n445\n00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.400\nSo we've got a plan for\nthat in our solution.\n\n446\n00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.543\nAnd that'll help to\nminimize that down time.\n\n447\n00:20:50.543 --> 00:20:55.525\nAll right, now, I know I showed NIC\nteaming in one of the previous episodes,\n\n448\n00:20:55.525 --> 00:20:56.610\nin section six.\n\n449\n00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.930\nSo, we got a chance to see that before.\n\n450\n00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.560\nBut some of these other technologies we\nhaven't seen, so I want to give you guys\n\n451\n00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.020\nsome examples of how we can implement this\nstuff and how we can put it in place.\n\n452\n00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.050\nAnd one of the ones I want to talk about,\nI gotta look at my notes and\n\n453\n00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.060\nmake sure I get these in\norder is clustering, right?\n\n454\n00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:15.060\nClustering, is where we can\nhave redundant servers.\n\n455\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.150\nIf one server fails,\nanother one can take over.\n\n456\n00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:21.070\nAnd that's when we have two servers,\nand it's redundancy, right?\n\n457\n00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.470\nI've got a second server.\n\n458\n00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:26.690\nBut we can turn it into fault tolerance,\nwe can turn it into high availability.\n\n459\n00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.660\nHaving a second server,\nit might be a cold backup, right?\n\n460\n00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.010\nSo you've got a server\nsitting there powered off.\n\n461\n00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.910\nAnd when your production one dies,\nyou yank the hard drives out of it.\n\n462\n00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:35.910\nYou stick it this other server.\n\n463\n00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.110\nYou power it on.\n\n464\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.120\nRight?\n\n465\n00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.400\nBut just like the flat tire example,\nI was off line for a few moments.\n\n466\n00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.960\nBut with a cluster, I take two servers and\nI give them shared storage.\n\n467\n00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.900\nAnd now,\nI can synchronize between them and\n\n468\n00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:54.070\nwe start to get that benefit,\nthat replication, that safety.\n\n469\n00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:58.020\nAnd I can do it in a model like this,\nwhere I've got two servers,\n\n470\n00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.070\nand they may be virtual machines,\nthey might be physical hosts, right?\n\n471\n00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.470\nEither way, they have that shared storage.\n\n472\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.240\nShared storage is really critical here,\nbecause if I wanna flip over to the other\n\n473\n00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.840\none, the other one needs access to\nthe current data as fast as possible.\n\n474\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.230\nAnd what better way to do that, than\nto give it access to the original data?\n\n475\n00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.460\nThe problem there is,\nI might need redundant SAN's, right?\n\n476\n00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.240\nAnd I might need redundant locations.\n\n477\n00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.480\nSo I've got one physical\nlocation here with a SAN,\n\n478\n00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.600\none location over here with a SAN.\n\n479\n00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.400\nI'm replicating between the SAN's.\n\n480\n00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.500\nAnd when we replicate, there's latency.\n\n481\n00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.650\nThere's delay.\n\n482\n00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:35.430\nIf a change happens on this end, how long\ndoes it take to get to this one over here?\n\n483\n00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:39.595\nSo, this nodes could go active on\na moments notice, but if my replication is\n\n484\n00:22:39.595 --> 00:22:43.760\nfive seconds behind, I'm gonna lose\nfive seconds of data, is that okay?\n\n485\n00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.930\nFor most people it is, but\nif you're a stock brokerage and\n\n486\n00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.690\nyou lose five seconds of trades,\nthat could be astronomical,\n\n487\n00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:54.060\nyou've got a billions of dollars in trade\nin that five seconds that you just lost.\n\n488\n00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.760\nNot acceptable, right?\n\n489\n00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.510\nSo you end up needing to run,\nwhat's called lock step.\n\n490\n00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:03.120\nLock step, you have synchronous and\nasynchronous replication.\n\n491\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.650\nWith synchronous replication,\nwhen a change is made in one side,\n\n492\n00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.880\nit's not considered committed,\nuntil it's changed on the other side.\n\n493\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.210\nThey run in lock step, okay?\n\n494\n00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.810\nThat is a good thing,\nwhen delay is not acceptable.\n\n495\n00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:17.600\nThe problem is,\n\n496\n00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.460\nif it take five seconds to replicate, now\nevery change I make takes five seconds.\n\n497\n00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:25.660\nAnd you see that with trades on the stock\nmarket, they give you a purchase time,\n\n498\n00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.200\nor something like that,\nwhere it can take a few seconds.\n\n499\n00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.395\nAnd it's because they're doing this exact\nthing here, so if a failure happens they\n\n500\n00:23:32.395 --> 00:23:35.730\ndon't lose any data, it's in lock step,\nbut it creates a delay.\n\n501\n00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.910\nAsynchronous replication\nis where I write data here,\n\n502\n00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.920\nand it's considered committed, while it's\nstill replicating to the other side.\n\n503\n00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.750\nAnd if I have a failure,\nI could lose data.\n\n504\n00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.910\nYou can lose data with asynchronous,\nyou don't lose data with synchronous.\n\n505\n00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.730\nSynchronous is slower but\nmore reliable, and\n\n506\n00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.770\nit's up to you to pick\nthe right technology there.\n\n507\n00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:55.502\nAll right, now when I just had a single\nset of storage, it's synchronous.\n\n508\n00:23:55.502 --> 00:23:57.512\nAll right,\nit's one node it's writing this storage,\n\n509\n00:23:57.512 --> 00:23:59.148\nthe other node has access\nto it immediately.\n\n510\n00:23:59.148 --> 00:24:01.574\nAnd that's what we normally\nsee with a cluster.\n\n511\n00:24:01.574 --> 00:24:07.330\nAnd so if I take a look at, at this node\nhere which I currently logged out of.\n\n512\n00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:12.790\nDefinitely get logged in this thing,\nthis is a cluster node, all right?\n\n513\n00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:16.360\nAnd it's throwing an error, that will\nrefresh field okay but that all right, and\n\n514\n00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.690\nso it's a cluster node,\nit's in a cluster with another system.\n\n515\n00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.840\nI know it's a cluster node because\nif I look here it says cluster\n\n516\n00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.110\nobject type, cluster node.\n\n517\n00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:26.260\nIt's not like and I know it's in\na cluster, but if I go up into my\n\n518\n00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.620\ntools here, I can go into the Microsoft\nfail over cluster manager and\n\n519\n00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.560\nwe can take a look at that cluster.\n\n520\n00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.869\nSo, this is SERVER01 and\n\n521\n00:24:33.869 --> 00:24:38.821\nSERVER01 is in a cluster with another\nnode that is creatively called SERVER02.\n\n522\n00:24:38.821 --> 00:24:43.620\nAnd so if I come in here and look at my\nnodes, I've got a SERVER01 and SERVER02\n\n523\n00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.176\nand actually look ago at it, I probably\nshould check this before the show.\n\n524\n00:24:46.176 --> 00:24:49.960\nSERVER02 is down [LAUGH] kind of,\nlittle bit of a problem there.\n\n525\n00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.380\nSERVER02 is down but SERVER01 is up.\n\n526\n00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:56.510\nAnd when I start adding storage,\nhere's my storage.\n\n527\n00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:00.140\nAnd if I take a look at the disks,\nI've got two cluster disks.\n\n528\n00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.910\nAnd see how they're both\nattached to SERVER01?\n\n529\n00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.710\nThat's because SERVER02 is down.\n\n530\n00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.500\nNormally cluster disk one will\nbe attached to SERVER01 and\n\n531\n00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.315\ncluster disk two will be\nattached to SERVER02.\n\n532\n00:25:09.315 --> 00:25:12.710\nBut SERVER02 fail, so\nSERVER01 took it over and\n\n533\n00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.250\nit got access to both of\nthose resources right?\n\n534\n00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.700\nThat's the advantage of having\na cluster is that an entire\n\n535\n00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.890\nphysical server could fail, and the other\none just takes over, takes over and\n\n536\n00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.010\nruns with it and can synchronize\nthings like virtual machines.\n\n537\n00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.530\nWe can take a virtual machine like\nthis one here, ITPROTV-WEB01,\n\n538\n00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.960\nand right now it's mounted on SERVER01.\n\n539\n00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.360\nBut I could take that and\nI can migrate it.\n\n540\n00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.830\nI can move it over to\none of my other systems.\n\n541\n00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.160\nAnd when we move it,\nmy head's gonna cover this up a bit, but\n\n542\n00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.980\nwe could move it to the best\npossible node or select a node.\n\n543\n00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.990\nIf I had another online system a server or\n\n544\n00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.900\ntwo was up I could move this\nvirtual machine to the other one.\n\n545\n00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.770\nMaybe I know I'm about to reboot server\none because I'm applying updates I could\n\n546\n00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:59.280\nmove all my VM's to the other node and\n\n547\n00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.330\nnow I can reboot server one and\nit's no big deal, right?\n\n548\n00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.510\nAnd, I can do it live\nwhile it's online and\n\n549\n00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.460\nthat means end users could be in that\nsystem and working right now and they wont\n\n550\n00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.520\neven notice it, it just transitions while\nit's live and that's the end of it.\n\n551\n00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.860\nIf you do a quick migration, what that\ndoes is it doesn't synchronize RAM,\n\n552\n00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:21.330\nit just take the VM, shuts it down and\nthen it powers it up on the other side.\n\n553\n00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:25.860\nAnd when it does that, well we lost what\nwas in ram it's like rebooting the server,\n\n554\n00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.970\nbut it's a lot quicker cause we're\nnot having to synchronize RAM.\n\n555\n00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:29.920\nSynchronizing RAM can take\na little bit you know the more\n\n556\n00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.510\nram you have the longer that takes.\n\n557\n00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.970\nSo, I'm trying to get choices and\nhow I want to move that.\n\n558\n00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:39.520\nBut a cluster configuration like this is\nreally important cause it can take care\n\n559\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.340\nof bringing that stuff online and I wonder\nwhat's going on with my other server.\n\n560\n00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.340\nIt is powered on but\nit's apparently got some kind of issue.\n\n561\n00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.550\nNow when you set up a cluster like this,\nyou've got to monitor it.\n\n562\n00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.920\nThis one went down and I didn't\nknow it cuz I'm not monitoring it.\n\n563\n00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.055\nBut if I were monitoring it I could see\nmaybe it lost connection to its discs,\n\n564\n00:26:56.055 --> 00:26:57.780\nright that could have happened.\n\n565\n00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.900\nMaybe it thinks it's online an it's happy,\nit's just not seeing the other node.\n\n566\n00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.545\nBut since all this stuff is red I'm\ngonna guess that's not the case.\n\n567\n00:27:04.545 --> 00:27:07.530\n[LAUGH] So, I've got a lot of\nred on my server panel here.\n\n568\n00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.090\nSo it's definitely got some kind of issue\nwhich I would need to track down and\n\n569\n00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:12.540\nfind out what's going on.\n\n570\n00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.670\nLooks like it's got a network\nadapter it's up there,\n\n571\n00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.640\nso I wonder if it just rebooted and\nit's not happy yet.\n\n572\n00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.010\nBut I would need to dig\nthrough the logs and find out.\n\n573\n00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:24.660\nThe point is when we configure a cluster\nlike this we're okay with that.\n\n574\n00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.110\nA node could fail and\nthe other node takes over right.\n\n575\n00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.320\nThat's definitely an important thing.\n\n576\n00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:35.830\nI'm shown you here in Hyper-V in just\nMicrosoft Windows, but Citrix Xenserver,\n\n577\n00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:41.910\nVMWare ESX, Red Hat running KVM,\nthey all support clustering technologies.\n\n578\n00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.755\nYou gotta look at your vendor\ndocumentation to see how to get it\n\n579\n00:27:43.755 --> 00:27:47.850\nset-up but once it's up, they work\nthe same way, one node can take over for\n\n580\n00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.170\nany other node, and\nit should happen dynamically.\n\n581\n00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:54.050\nA failure will be invisible on your\nnetwork except for slower performance cuz\n\n582\n00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.760\nyou just lost a little bit of RAM, a\nlittle bit of hard drive space, and so on.\n\n583\n00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.450\n>> We've been looking at\nbusiness continuity concepts and\n\n584\n00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.660\nbeen focusing on the disaster recovery.\n\n585\n00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.780\nRemember, your business\nis important to you, and\n\n586\n00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.990\nif something does happen like this,\nyou need to bring it back online.\n\n587\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:10.605\nDon, got anything else for us in this one?\n\n588\n00:28:10.605 --> 00:28:13.990\n>> Yeah, I didn't really get to show\nyou guys setting up a lot of this and\n\n589\n00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.840\nI do wanna show that.\n\n590\n00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.140\nSo lets do a part two and\n\n591\n00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.430\nI want to run through a few other\nconcepts to be able to jump in and\n\n592\n00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:23.740\ndemonstrate how to get this going like\nnetwork load balancing and replication.\n\n593\n00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.590\nI wanna show you a georeplication\nbecause it's something a lot of people\n\n594\n00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:31.410\nreally kind of get intimidated by like man\nhow am I gonna replicate data between two\n\n595\n00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:32.640\ngeographic locations.\n\n596\n00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.820\nI wanna show you how if we leverage a\ncloud service, it can actually be really,\n\n597\n00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:36.830\nreally easy.\n\n598\n00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.550\nSo it's definitely something\nyou want to take advantage of.\n\n599\n00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.170\nWe'll kind of walk through that process,\ntoo.\n\n600\n00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:40.670\n>> Very good.\n\n601\n00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:41.810\nI look forward to seeing that.\n\n602\n00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.880\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou there with us, too.\n\n603\n00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.170\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n604\n00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.870\nI've been your host, Wes Brian.\n\n605\n00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:48.540\n>> And I'm Don Pizzet.\n\n606\n00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.977\n>> And we'll see you next time\n\n607\n00:28:49.977 --> 00:28:57.075\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.422\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.422 --> 00:00:19.861\nin this episode we're gonna be continuing\nalong in our Cloud Plus series.\n\n5\n00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:23.909\nAnd this is actually coming at you with\na part two, we've been looking at business\n\n6\n00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:27.031\ncontinuity and specifically\nfocusing on disaster recovery.\n\n7\n00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:29.700\nWell, we had a lot of good\ninformation in the first part,\n\n8\n00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.330\nso if you haven't seen that episode,\nmaybe you're joining us for\n\n9\n00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.570\nthe first time, go back and\nwatch that first episode.\n\n10\n00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.990\nBut here in part two disaster recovery,\nwe've got none other than Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.910\nDon, how you doing today sir?\n\n12\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.980\n>> I am doing great Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.130\nThanks for having me back on the show and\nin the last episode I didn't get a chance\n\n14\n00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.000\nto show you guys the implementation\nof a lot of this stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.460\nAnd so I definitely want to take\nsome time here in this episode and\n\n16\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.570\nget a chance to see that and\nkind of apply a real world concept to it.\n\n17\n00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.160\nBut there were a few last little things\nthat I do need to mention that we didn't\n\n18\n00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.300\nget to in the last episode which is\nwhen we setup failover like this,\n\n19\n00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.800\nwhen we set up high\navailability solutions.\n\n20\n00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.150\nI mentioned how we might wanna\nset up more than one location,\n\n21\n00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.940\nespecially with\nthe disaster recovery plan.\n\n22\n00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.410\nYou may have your production data center\nand then the DR site somewhere and\n\n23\n00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.570\nthe example I gave was using like\nMicrosoft Azure site recovery where you\n\n24\n00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.310\nmight have your production servers right\nhere in your own local data center.\n\n25\n00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.420\nAnd then have your backups\nup in Azure up in the cloud.\n\n26\n00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.140\nBut that other location, that could\nbe a separate building that you own.\n\n27\n00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.790\nIt could be a building that you\nrent like from a hosting provider.\n\n28\n00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.410\nIt could be any number of things.\n\n29\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.880\nAnd CompTIA calls out some different\nclassifications for those.\n\n30\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.790\nHot site, cold side, and warm site.\n\n31\n00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.940\nSo let me talk a little bit about those.\n\n32\n00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.160\nA hot site is the best option.\n\n33\n00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.141\nA hot site is where you've got a data\ncenter with all your production servers\n\n34\n00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:49.122\nand then you have a second data somewhere\nelse with copies of your production\n\n35\n00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:52.686\ndata center up and running,\nthat is up and running at the same time.\n\n36\n00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:56.912\nThat both locations are running and\nfunctional at any given time.\n\n37\n00:01:56.912 --> 00:02:00.306\nAnd you might be load balancing your\ncustomers across both locations, or\n\n38\n00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:04.027\neverybody might be going to one but you\ncan flip over at a moment's notice because\n\n39\n00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:06.250\nthe other side is already up and running.\n\n40\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.890\nThat's called a hot site.\n\n41\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.450\nA hot site is a clone of your current\nenvironment that is active, that is up and\n\n42\n00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.020\nrunning and powered and\nits hot, it's ready to go.\n\n43\n00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.970\nRight.\n\n44\n00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.190\nA cold site is different.\n\n45\n00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.000\nA cold site is where we have another\nlocation with the hardware and servers\n\n46\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.560\nready to take over for our production\nenvironment, but they're all turned off.\n\n47\n00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.090\nAnd I may have backups over there.\n\n48\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.300\nThey might be being replicated, or\n\n49\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.530\nthese might be tapes that\nI'm shipping over there.\n\n50\n00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.210\nSo, now if I have a failure, my production\nenvironment goes down, I hop in my car,\n\n51\n00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.520\nI drive over to the cold site and\nI start popping in backup tapes and\n\n52\n00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.195\ndoing restores.\n\n53\n00:02:40.195 --> 00:02:42.670\nRight.\nIt's gonna take time to restore but\n\n54\n00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.450\nI've already got the servers, I've already\ngot the infrastructures ready to go.\n\n55\n00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.800\nIt's a cold site though cuz\nthe servers are all powered down,\n\n56\n00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.640\nthey're not up and running.\n\n57\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.850\nThink of it like a car, you know is\nthe car warmed up or is it still cold?\n\n58\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.560\nThis would be a cold site.\n\n59\n00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.410\nA warm site is in between.\n\n60\n00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.940\nAnd what a warm site does\nis it says I'm gonna do\n\n61\n00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.690\nlive replicas of my\nmission critical systems.\n\n62\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.614\nThe mission critical systems are in\nthe DR site, they're up, they're running,\n\n63\n00:03:05.614 --> 00:03:08.300\nthey're active,\nthey can go at a moment's notice.\n\n64\n00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.030\nBut all the noncritical systems\nare just sitting there.\n\n65\n00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.320\nThey're just sitting there,\nthey're not turned on, their back up tapes\n\n66\n00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.910\nare sitting on the shelf right beside\nthem, I'll have to do a restore, so\n\n67\n00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.270\nsome things are cold, some things\nare hot and they call that a warm site.\n\n68\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.520\nAnd that's usually the most\ncost effective solution,\n\n69\n00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.680\nright, cuz it's less data to replicate and\nour critical stuff is ready to go.\n\n70\n00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.290\nSo a warm site is really\nthe most common of them, but\n\n71\n00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.010\nif you're leveraging something like\na cloud service you can do a warm site,\n\n72\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.950\nyou can do cold, you can do hot.\n\n73\n00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.210\nIt's really just your choice\nas you deploy it out.\n\n74\n00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.790\nWhen you do a physical location,\none that you control,\n\n75\n00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.172\nit's usually your budget that determines\nwhether you're cold, warm or hot, right?\n\n76\n00:03:44.172 --> 00:03:46.930\nOkay, cuz it's more and more expensive\nwith each one that you offer.\n\n77\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.040\n>> That's one of the things that I say in\nthe security plus as we talk about those\n\n78\n00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.350\nsites as well is pay attention\nto the temperature, right?\n\n79\n00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.890\nPay attention to the thermometer.\n\n80\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.210\nAs the temperature goes up and\nincreases so does the expense.\n\n81\n00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.030\nAs the temperature goes up and increases,\n\n82\n00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.080\nnot only does the expense but\nthe time to failover decreases.\n\n83\n00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.950\nAs you lower the temperature\non that thermometer you start\n\n84\n00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.750\nlowering the expense but\nthen you start increasing how long\n\n85\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.125\nit takes to get those\nsystems back online there.\n\n86\n00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:12.790\n>> Yeah.\nAnd the other thing I didn't talk about,\n\n87\n00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.580\nI mentioned geo-replication where I have\ntwo completely different data centers in\n\n88\n00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.860\ntwo completely different geographic\nregions, I replicate my data between them\n\n89\n00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.650\nIf one fails we can just jump\nright over to the other.\n\n90\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.250\nRight?\n\n91\n00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.710\nThe thing I didn't mention, was failback.\n\n92\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.290\nWhat do I do after I recover?\n\n93\n00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.020\nSo maybe my main data center has\nsome longstanding power outage, so\n\n94\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.260\nI flip over to the backup.\n\n95\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.690\nAnd now we're running in the backup.\n\n96\n00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.000\nWell, power gets restored at my main\ndata center and once that's done,\n\n97\n00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.030\nI need to get back again.\n\n98\n00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.080\nWell, a lot of people\nconfigure replication to send\n\n99\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.870\nfrom production to backup.\n\n100\n00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.116\nBut then they don't configure replication\nfrom back up back to production.\n\n101\n00:04:45.116 --> 00:04:46.830\nWe need to plan for that return trip too,\n\n102\n00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.210\nhow do I get back to my production data\ncenter and get things up and going?\n\n103\n00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.218\nAnd that's where having a hot site, where\nyou've got like two way replication where\n\n104\n00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:56.038\nboth are active, we don't have to worry\nabout failback cuz their both active.\n\n105\n00:04:56.038 --> 00:04:58.630\nWe just bring the original and\nback up and we're good to go.\n\n106\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.040\nBut if you're doing a cold site, I\nbasically have to set up my old production\n\n107\n00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.910\nenvironment as a cold site now where I can\nget my backups over there and restore and\n\n108\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.680\nbring it back online.\n\n109\n00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.257\nAnd so you've got to have a good plan for\nthat failback also.\n\n110\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.265\nAll right, well, let's talk a little bit\nabout, where do I want to start here.\n\n111\n00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:17.853\nLet's start with an important\nconcept MPIO, right?\n\n112\n00:05:17.853 --> 00:05:19.825\nMPIO is multi path input output and\n\n113\n00:05:19.825 --> 00:05:23.230\nI know I mentioned this in\nsome of the SAN episodes.\n\n114\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.930\nIn some of the diagrams\nthat I showed you guys,\n\n115\n00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.000\nI showed a redundant fabric like this\nwhere I've got a SAN up here and\n\n116\n00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.520\nI've got nodes that I want\nto connect to the SAN.\n\n117\n00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.590\nSo I've got four servers,\n\n118\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.470\nfour virtual machine hosts that\nI want to connect to that SAN.\n\n119\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.920\nAnd I might put two HBAs in them, right?\n\n120\n00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.240\nOne HBA that runs to one switch\nthen runs to the SAN, and\n\n121\n00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.720\nanother HBA that runs to another switch\nthat runs to the same SAN, all right?\n\n122\n00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.160\nThat gives me two\ncompletely separate HBAs,\n\n123\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.230\ntwo completely separate switches,\nand two completely\n\n124\n00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.560\nseparate sets of fiber optic cables\nthat run between me and the SAN.\n\n125\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.160\nSo if any one of those components fail\nI can jump over to another one, right?\n\n126\n00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.160\nWell, the problem with this model is,\nby default, when you're\n\n127\n00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.640\nnode goes to connect to the SAN,\nit's only gonna use one of those links.\n\n128\n00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.280\nIt's gonna use whichever one comes up\nfirst, that's the one it's gonna use.\n\n129\n00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.550\nThe other one is like a standby.\n\n130\n00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.208\nIf your main one fails,\nit'll then flip over to the other one.\n\n131\n00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:22.121\nSo think of it as like a cold site, right?\n\n132\n00:06:22.121 --> 00:06:25.692\nIt's a backup that it can flip\nover to when it needs to, right?\n\n133\n00:06:25.692 --> 00:06:29.630\nBut what MPIO does is it\nenables multipathing.\n\n134\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.380\nIt allows me to send traffic\nacross both sets of links.\n\n135\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.060\nSo I can be sending traffic across\nthe orange link here up to the SAN and\n\n136\n00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.940\ntraffic across the red link\nthrough the other fiber,\n\n137\n00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.290\nthe other HPA,\nthe other switch to get to that SAN.\n\n138\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.560\nAnd now I have two paths,\nand they're both active.\n\n139\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.665\nI could effectively double my bandwidth,\nright?\n\n140\n00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:52.020\nAnd, Wes mentioned this before the show,\nlike, hey this is a great idea,\n\n141\n00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.360\nwe'd wanna do this.\n\n142\n00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.670\nYou gotta be careful,\nbecause you can over saturate your SAN.\n\n143\n00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.220\nDoes my SAN have the bandwidth\nto handle two connections from\n\n144\n00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.340\nevery one of these hosts out here?\n\n145\n00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.630\nIt may or may not, right?\n\n146\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.480\nSo you might need more than one SAN,\nor better controllers, or\n\n147\n00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.160\nwhatever to support that.\n\n148\n00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.870\nBut multipathing like\nthis is not always on.\n\n149\n00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.030\nAnd when we set up something like this\nmodel where I've got two locations,\n\n150\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.640\nI might not be ready to send traffic to\nboth of these locations at the same time,\n\n151\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.290\nthey might not be in lockstep.\n\n152\n00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.300\nBut if they are, I can send traffic to\nboth and I can take advantage of that.\n\n153\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.850\nJust remember that it is a rare day\nthat this is turned on by default.\n\n154\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.690\nSo for example, in my cluster over here,\n\n155\n00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.500\nI showed you guys this cluster in the last\nepisode, where I've got two nodes,\n\n156\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.470\nserver one and server two, and\nthey've got shared storage.\n\n157\n00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.920\nIf I jump here into my disks,\n\n158\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.230\nthis is the shared storage between them,\nand it's connected to a SAN.\n\n159\n00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.427\nIt's an iSCSI SAN.\n\n160\n00:07:43.427 --> 00:07:47.366\nAnd if I have more than one network\nadapter, I can do NIC teaming on it and\n\n161\n00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:51.437\nI get advantages there, but if I have\ntwo completely separate networks,\n\n162\n00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:53.474\ntwo completely different subnets,\n\n163\n00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:56.520\nI might be able to connect to\nthat SAN more than one way.\n\n164\n00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.148\nAnd if I do that, I can enable\nmultipathing and really take advantage of\n\n165\n00:08:00.148 --> 00:08:03.351\nthat All right, just to show you\nhow you would do that in iSCSI,\n\n166\n00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:06.850\nthere's a few steps that\nwe have to jump through.\n\n167\n00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.359\nThe first thing is in Windows,\nMPIO is actually not enabled by default.\n\n168\n00:08:10.359 --> 00:08:12.753\nSo if I have fiber optic HBAs, or\n\n169\n00:08:12.753 --> 00:08:17.552\nif I just have iSCSI network adapters,\nit's not gonna do MPIO.\n\n170\n00:08:17.552 --> 00:08:18.806\nI have to turn it on.\n\n171\n00:08:18.806 --> 00:08:21.438\nAnd in Windows that's a feature\nyou have to install, so\n\n172\n00:08:21.438 --> 00:08:25.022\nif you jump into your server manager,\nyou can go up to manage and add roles and\n\n173\n00:08:25.022 --> 00:08:27.502\nfeatures and\nit'll be buried in your feature list.\n\n174\n00:08:27.502 --> 00:08:30.568\nAnd I think I've actually already got it\ninstalled on mine, let's see if I do.\n\n175\n00:08:30.568 --> 00:08:33.977\nWhen I get to features,\nI'm just gonna look for my MPIO,\n\n176\n00:08:33.977 --> 00:08:37.115\nI'm glad I checked cuz we\ndon't have it installed.\n\n177\n00:08:37.115 --> 00:08:39.880\nSo there it is Multipath I/O,\nright here on my feature list,\n\n178\n00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.127\nI just need to check that off and\nget it installed.\n\n179\n00:08:42.127 --> 00:08:45.101\nAll right, now MPIO is kind of\na big change for the server,\n\n180\n00:08:45.101 --> 00:08:47.673\nso when I install that\nit's gonna have to reboot.\n\n181\n00:08:47.673 --> 00:08:51.134\nAll right, because now we're telling,\nhey when you go to look for your storage,\n\n182\n00:08:51.134 --> 00:08:54.614\nthere could actually be more than one way\nto get there and if there is that's okay.\n\n183\n00:08:54.614 --> 00:08:55.497\nBut you know what?\n\n184\n00:08:55.497 --> 00:08:57.774\nWe can use both of them,\nhow awesome is that?\n\n185\n00:08:57.774 --> 00:08:59.696\nWe can load balance and\ntake advantage of these and\n\n186\n00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:01.774\nif one fails we just use\nthe other one it's seemless.\n\n187\n00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:03.471\nWe get high availability, right?\n\n188\n00:09:03.471 --> 00:09:06.747\nAnd redundancy and increased bandwidth\nwith lots of benefits to this.\n\n189\n00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:09.503\nThe negative being that we could\nsend more traffic to the same,\n\n190\n00:09:09.503 --> 00:09:13.000\nthen it can handle, so we gotta monitor\nthat too but it can take advantage of it.\n\n191\n00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.476\nAll right, so\nthat's gonna install it installed and\n\n192\n00:09:15.476 --> 00:09:18.953\nit didn't ask me to reboot but I am\nalmost certain that it's gotta reboot.\n\n193\n00:09:18.953 --> 00:09:20.408\nSo, I'll tell you what,\n\n194\n00:09:20.408 --> 00:09:23.994\nI'm gonna reboot this on anyway\njust because I don't trust it.\n\n195\n00:09:23.994 --> 00:09:28.042\nSo, pretty certain that\nthat's got to reboot.\n\n196\n00:09:28.042 --> 00:09:30.970\nSo, we'll get that in a quick restart and\nyou know while it's restarting,\n\n197\n00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.311\nlet me jump over to the other node.\n\n198\n00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:34.997\nThis is a node that was not\nreacting well earlier and\n\n199\n00:09:34.997 --> 00:09:39.070\nI'm just gonna install MPIO here on this\nguy too and we'll give him a reboot.\n\n200\n00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.070\nSo I'll just add that feature on this one.\n\n201\n00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.510\nIf you enable MPIO on one node and not\non the other, you start to get different\n\n202\n00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.300\nperformance characteristics,\none host is faster than the other host.\n\n203\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.140\nSo VMs perform better on one than\nthe other and it starts skewing your\n\n204\n00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.000\nperformance reports, so you normally\nwant to keep this stuff consistent.\n\n205\n00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.710\nAnd that's why I'm gonna turn it\non on this other node also, so\n\n206\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.820\nI'm just gonna hunt down and find that.\n\n207\n00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.900\nAnd we'll turn on Multipath I/O.\n\n208\n00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.380\nIt used to be that when you got fiber\nHBAs MPIO was a feature of the HBAs but\n\n209\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.040\nMicrosoft brought it into\nthe operating system.\n\n210\n00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.020\nVMWare ESX has it built\ninto the operating system.\n\n211\n00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.190\nIf you do Red Hat you do have\nto add it on with like KVM.\n\n212\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.616\nBut Zen Server,\nVMWare ESX they've got it built in.\n\n213\n00:10:18.616 --> 00:10:20.860\n>> You know one day while we're\nwaiting for this to reboot Don,\n\n214\n00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.670\nyou said it's built into\nthe operating system.\n\n215\n00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:27.010\nDoes this fall in the same concept theory\nof software acceleration versus hardware\n\n216\n00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:27.882\nacceleration?\n\n217\n00:10:27.882 --> 00:10:32.005\nWhen you're doing something like this are\nyou robbing the system of anything if it's\n\n218\n00:10:32.005 --> 00:10:35.799\nsoftware or is not quite the same thing\nas like CPU versus dedicated hardware?\n\n219\n00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:39.784\n>> It is being done in software and\nto my knowledge there is no other option.\n\n220\n00:10:39.784 --> 00:10:41.173\nNo other option,\nthere is no hardware equivalent to this.\n\n221\n00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:41.916\n>> I got you.\n\n222\n00:10:41.916 --> 00:10:46.079\n>> It's like, because when your software\nis sending writes to the hard drives,\n\n223\n00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:48.615\nthat write operation is\ncoming from software.\n\n224\n00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:51.254\nAnd it may be handed off to a hardware\nRAID controller then writes and\n\n225\n00:10:51.254 --> 00:10:51.863\nyou're done.\n\n226\n00:10:51.863 --> 00:10:53.489\nBut when we've got Multipath I/O,\n\n227\n00:10:53.489 --> 00:10:56.327\nit's the operating system has\nto determine where to send that.\n\n228\n00:10:56.327 --> 00:10:58.025\nAnd so it's always gonna be involved,\n\n229\n00:10:58.025 --> 00:10:59.987\nthere's no real good\nway to get around that.\n\n230\n00:10:59.987 --> 00:11:03.367\nAll right, my other node finished\nrebooting so I'll just jump back into it,\n\n231\n00:11:03.367 --> 00:11:04.882\nthe first one is still rebooting.\n\n232\n00:11:04.882 --> 00:11:09.280\nSo now all I have to do is go in and\ntell it that I want to do multipathing.\n\n233\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.390\nIf we've got fiber HPAs,\nI would need to launch into my\n\n234\n00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.160\nHPA configuration utility and I would\nneed to identify the separate targets.\n\n235\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.110\nI'm doing iSCSI, so I'm gonna\nlaunch into my iSCSI initiator and\n\n236\n00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.610\nget it kinda set up there.\n\n237\n00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.830\nSo, what I need to do is,\nI actually have to do this in two places.\n\n238\n00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.640\nFirst off, we need to turn MPIO on.\n\n239\n00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.960\nJust installing it was part of the battle,\ngetting it turned on is the other part.\n\n240\n00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.690\nSo, in my server manager, as soon as\nit refreshes this screen, there we go.\n\n241\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.900\nI can go up here to Tools, and\nMPIO shows up as a new management tool, so\n\n242\n00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.400\nI'm gonna fire up MPIO.\n\n243\n00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.460\nAnd the MPIO screen doesn't\nhave a ton of options.\n\n244\n00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.080\nBasically it's got MPIO devices and\n\n245\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.260\nits showing if it's picking\nup any devices it supported.\n\n246\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.190\nYou've got HBAs they'll show up here.\n\n247\n00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.370\nMy iSCSI configuration showing up.\n\n248\n00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.620\nAnd then we go to Discover Multi-Paths,\nnotice that it's got these options.\n\n249\n00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.104\nAdd support for ISCSI devices,\nAdd support for SAS devices, right?\n\n250\n00:12:00.104 --> 00:12:01.636\nISCSI for ISCSI and SAS for\n\n251\n00:12:01.636 --> 00:12:05.262\nyour HBAs that are connecting to\nLANs that are stored on a SAN.\n\n252\n00:12:05.262 --> 00:12:09.102\nAll right, I'm gonna turn it on for ISCSI,\nif I had HBAs I would turn that one on.\n\n253\n00:12:09.102 --> 00:12:11.682\nAll right, so\nif I had HBAs they would show up here as\n\n254\n00:12:11.682 --> 00:12:15.842\na hardware ID since I've got iSCSI it's\nall virtual, it doesn't show up there.\n\n255\n00:12:15.842 --> 00:12:20.462\nSo I just needed to check that option and\nthen that's gonna turn on multi pathing.\n\n256\n00:12:20.462 --> 00:12:21.910\nAll right, now it's on,\n\n257\n00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.380\nbut I'm actually not using it,\nwell for HBAs they'll start to use it.\n\n258\n00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.700\nThey'll do the detection and run and\nstart using it, but for iSCSI I got to get\n\n259\n00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.900\none more step, I'm gonna go up here to\ntools and get into my iSCSI initiator.\n\n260\n00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.732\nAnd in the iSCSI initiator,\nyou have targets, and\n\n261\n00:12:36.732 --> 00:12:40.240\nnormally your targets is just one SAN,\nand that's it, right?\n\n262\n00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.310\nThat's how I'm connected here.\n\n263\n00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:46.690\nBut if I take that connection and I pull\nup it's properties, in the properties for\n\n264\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.130\nit, you'll see where I've got sessions,\nand I've got one session open to that SAN.\n\n265\n00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.810\nWell, if I have another\npath I can add a session.\n\n266\n00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.500\nAnd when I add that session I can\nenable multipath right there.\n\n267\n00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.670\nAnd now, it's gonna say, okay,\n\n268\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.770\nif I have more than one way\nto get there I can use it.\n\n269\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.800\nI can take advantage of that and\nI can reach out and connect to it.\n\n270\n00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.300\nAnd so when I put that in,\nsee how I've got two sessions now?\n\n271\n00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.270\nI've got the first session that ends in\none, and this other one ends in three.\n\n272\n00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.940\nAnd I've enabled multipathing.\n\n273\n00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.610\nAnd so now if it can find a way to\nthat SAN, a second way to that SAN,\n\n274\n00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.110\nit'll take advantage of that and\nit'll start to use it.\n\n275\n00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.080\nAnd now I've got Multipath I/O, but I had\nto configure it, I had to turn it on.\n\n276\n00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.010\nJust because you've got the cables run,\nit doesn't mean anything.\n\n277\n00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:30.930\nWell, I guess it does.\n\n278\n00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.170\nIt's usually going to be\nactive in standby, right?\n\n279\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:37.039\nBut if you want active-active, if you want\nfull multi pathing with redundancy and\n\n280\n00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:38.984\nthe extra bandwidth you gotta turn it on.\n\n281\n00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:41.561\n>> Well now I can see that\nthis is on our local machine.\n\n282\n00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:43.460\nNow Don, this being a cloud show,\n\n283\n00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.456\nI imagine that you also have some\ntechniques or technologies that you can\n\n284\n00:13:47.456 --> 00:13:50.881\nalso perform this in the cloud\nside of things as well, right?\n\n285\n00:13:50.881 --> 00:13:55.236\n>> Absolutely, now when you deal with\na cloud solution your data is being stored\n\n286\n00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:58.192\nin the cloud like with\nAmazon web services, right?\n\n287\n00:13:58.192 --> 00:14:00.785\nYour data's up there and\nthey're replicating it and\n\n288\n00:14:00.785 --> 00:14:04.252\nmaintaining that backup between\nwhat are called availability zones.\n\n289\n00:14:04.252 --> 00:14:07.843\nSo if one system goes down,\nthey've already got a backup.\n\n290\n00:14:07.843 --> 00:14:10.959\nBasically a warm backup or whatever of\nyour instance, your server that's running\n\n291\n00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:13.420\nin another location and\nthey can spin it up on a moment's notice.\n\n292\n00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.892\nSo you don't worry about it.\n\n293\n00:14:14.892 --> 00:14:16.170\nYou don't have to configure this,\nthey've already done it.\n\n294\n00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:20.266\nThey completely hide that from you, so\nyou don't have to deal with it, and\n\n295\n00:14:20.266 --> 00:14:22.170\nyour server stays up.\n\n296\n00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.630\nBut there are some times we\ncan get involved with it.\n\n297\n00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.415\nFor example, geo replication.\n\n298\n00:14:26.415 --> 00:14:30.060\nAll right, I wanna show you guys\nan example of geo replication, cuz it\n\n299\n00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.860\nsounds kind of scary, it sounds kind of\ncomplex but it's really not that bad.\n\n300\n00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.610\nLet me just give you an example.\n\n301\n00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:40.780\nSo here I am in Microsoft Azure, and\nI've got a SQL database fired up.\n\n302\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.388\nSo if you look I created this\ndatabase here just called SampleDB1.\n\n303\n00:14:44.388 --> 00:14:50.850\nAnd SampleDB1 is hosted on a server and\nthat server is East US 2, right?\n\n304\n00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.108\nEast US 2,\nif I go back out to my big map, here,\n\n305\n00:14:54.108 --> 00:14:59.340\nthat means that my SQL Server is right\nhere in this green check mark, right?\n\n306\n00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.130\nThat's where my server's running.\n\n307\n00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.990\nWhat happens if that data center fails?\n\n308\n00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.932\nWhat if there's a big storm?\n\n309\n00:15:03.932 --> 00:15:06.904\nIt was super storm Sandy, right,?\n\n310\n00:15:06.904 --> 00:15:08.924\nThat blew through, or\nsomething like that, right?\n\n311\n00:15:08.924 --> 00:15:13.610\nWell, that data center might go down,\nthat whole data center might go down.\n\n312\n00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.250\nWhat about my data?\n\n313\n00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.960\nThat's where my database is.\n\n314\n00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.550\nWell, they're automatically giving me\nredundancy within that data center.\n\n315\n00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.070\nSo if it's a failure right in there that's\nlocal they can just flip me over to\n\n316\n00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.000\nanother rack and I'm back in business.\n\n317\n00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.980\nBut if the whole data center goes down,\nmy database goes down.\n\n318\n00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.580\nAnd they're backing it up.\n\n319\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.600\nMicrosoft aways promises\nyou three backups, right?\n\n320\n00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.760\nSo you've got your live data, you've got\na copy right there in the data center with\n\n321\n00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.520\nyou, and you've got one more copy in\na different region somewhere else.\n\n322\n00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.120\nBut the problem is, that copy in\na different region, it's not in lock step.\n\n323\n00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.724\nThat if they have to recover to that\nyou might lose a few seconds of data.\n\n324\n00:15:46.724 --> 00:15:50.677\nIf I want this in real time, in lock\nstep where I can flip over to one and\n\n325\n00:15:50.677 --> 00:15:53.214\nnot lose any data,\nI gotta set it up myself.\n\n326\n00:15:53.214 --> 00:15:56.079\nAnd so maybe I wanna have a copy\nover here in West U.S., right?\n\n327\n00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:56.880\nWay over here.\n\n328\n00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.517\nSo now I'll have that or.\n\n329\n00:15:58.517 --> 00:15:59.911\nHey, maybe I want to go crazy.\n\n330\n00:15:59.911 --> 00:16:02.777\nI want it to be different continents.\n\n331\n00:16:02.777 --> 00:16:06.487\nI might choose to have a copy over in\nEurope, down in Australia, or whenever it\n\n332\n00:16:06.487 --> 00:16:10.930\nis, I don't think it will let me do\nAustralia, but a different area like that.\n\n333\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.170\nWhen we start going different continents,\n\n334\n00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.500\nyou are probably going\nto have some latency.\n\n335\n00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.240\nYou've got to plan for that.\n\n336\n00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:15.890\nYou've got to test and\n\n337\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.620\nmeasure the latency and know what that\ndelay is to understand your back up, but\n\n338\n00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:24.460\nyou can set it up to replicate it, and\nif you read the documentation, Microsoft\n\n339\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.140\nactually has these replication pipes set\nup between some of their data centers,\n\n340\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:33.520\nwhere you can get really fast replication\nbetween peered, or paired, data centers.\n\n341\n00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.700\nBut if you try to replicate\nbetween two that aren't paired,\n\n342\n00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.660\nyou start to get these delays.\n\n343\n00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.060\nSo check out the documentation\nof your cloud provider.\n\n344\n00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.110\nBut to show you how to just\nturn this on real quick.\n\n345\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.510\nIf I wanna turn it on for\nmy SQL database, right?\n\n346\n00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.330\nI'm gonna jump in to my\nsample database here.\n\n347\n00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.330\nAnd when you pull up the database itself,\n\n348\n00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.900\nit kind of start showing you information\nabout it and way down here at the bottom\n\n349\n00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:00.810\nof the screen, you'll see this part\nwhere it says, Georeplication.\n\n350\n00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.040\nAnd looking at it right here,\n\n351\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.500\nsee how I just have the one\nlittle checkmark and that's it?\n\n352\n00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.720\nI don't have any replicas of this data.\n\n353\n00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.700\nIt's just right here.\n\n354\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.780\nAnd Microsoft's got my back,\nthey've got backups of it, but\n\n355\n00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.070\nit's not like a live backup.\n\n356\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:14.730\nIt's not one that's ready to go right now.\n\n357\n00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.884\nBut I can configure Georeplication,\nand it'll set that up for me, right?\n\n358\n00:17:17.884 --> 00:17:20.651\nAnd when we set it up, basically\nwhat we do is we come in here and\n\n359\n00:17:20.651 --> 00:17:22.930\nwe pick where we wanna replicate to.\n\n360\n00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:23.590\nAll right?\n\n361\n00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:25.210\nAnd, as I look at these datas and\n\n362\n00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:30.060\nI see these little green, what are those,\noctagons, hexagons, something like that?\n\n363\n00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.060\nI see these little hexagons that\nrepresent different data centers.\n\n364\n00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.680\nOkay?\n\n365\n00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.760\nNotice, how they are ending in Australia.\n\n366\n00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.090\nThat means, that because I picked U.S.\n\n367\n00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:43.050\neast two up here, it doesn't have a pair\nwith Australia and if I were to try to\n\n368\n00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:46.070\nreplicate to Australia, it would take\ntoo long, so they won't let me do it.\n\n369\n00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.970\nBut I can replicate to China.\n\n370\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:48.630\nThere's a great idea,\n\n371\n00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.990\nwhere I can replicate to in England,\nor just right here in the US.\n\n372\n00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.020\nIf I want the best possible performance,\nright here in the US is gonna give me some\n\n373\n00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.830\ngreat performance, and\nthey're showing this one up here.\n\n374\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.936\nSee how it's purple, right?\n\n375\n00:17:59.936 --> 00:18:06.160\nThey're telling me that's the best option\nfor me, if I want the best replication.\n\n376\n00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.010\nI should go with that purple one, right?\n\n377\n00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.510\nI can go with one of these green ones,\nthen they'll work.\n\n378\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.690\nBut it's not going to be as good,\nas if I go with this purple one.\n\n379\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.980\nNow, this is east US.\n\n380\n00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.500\nThis other one,\nI forget what they call it, but\n\n381\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.930\nit's in one of the Nebraska's or\nOmaha or something like that.\n\n382\n00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.400\nThere's only one Nebraska,\nwhy did I say multiple?\n\n383\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.090\nI'm thinking the Dakota's.\n\n384\n00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.980\nSo anyhow,\nmy geographical skills are really limited.\n\n385\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.060\nBut I can just choose that one, okay?\n\n386\n00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.170\nAnd when I choose it, I chose that\nCentral US, and now it's asking me,\n\n387\n00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.720\nwhat type of secondary I wanna set up.\n\n388\n00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.630\nThis is really important, all right?\n\n389\n00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:44.480\nWith databases, you usually only have\none writable copy of the database.\n\n390\n00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:51.300\nSo, my secondary, I have to choose, do I\nwanted to be readable or non-readable?\n\n391\n00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.440\nI can't make it writable.\n\n392\n00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.030\nI can't write to, cuz it's a database.\n\n393\n00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.860\nIf this were file storage,\nI can make it writable, but\n\n394\n00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.420\nsince it's a database,\nI've only got one writable copy.\n\n395\n00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.830\nBut I can read from the other, and if\nthey're in lock step like they would be,\n\n396\n00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.740\nI can distribute my read traffic and\nget a performance boost.\n\n397\n00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.770\nI won't get a write performance boost,\nbut i'll get a read performance boost.\n\n398\n00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.780\nOr I can make it non-readable,\n\n399\n00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.640\nwhich means nobody can touch this\nthing unless a failure happens.\n\n400\n00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.530\nI wanna make mine readable, so\nI can get a performance benefit out of it.\n\n401\n00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.700\nSo I've got it set as Readable.\n\n402\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.260\nAnd now, I need a target server.\n\n403\n00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.420\nI need another server that's over\nin that U.S. Central region.\n\n404\n00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.850\nI don't have one, so\nI'm gonna have to create a new one.\n\n405\n00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:33.450\nSo I'll create a new server,\nwhich I'll just call itprotv-db2.\n\n406\n00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.090\nAnd I need a log in for it, so\nI can get logged in to the thing.\n\n407\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.369\nOtherwise, it's kinda hard to manage.\n\n408\n00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.110\nAnd did it not like my password?\n\n409\n00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.010\nApparently, my passwords don't match.\n\n410\n00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.013\nThat's gonna be the challenge of the day.\n\n411\n00:19:47.013 --> 00:19:50.136\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n412\n00:19:50.136 --> 00:19:53.590\nYou remember Geo applications easy,\nsetting your password is hard.\n\n413\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.210\nSo I'm gonna get that put in there,\nthere we go.\n\n414\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.110\nAll right, so now it's got a server to\nreplicate to, and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n415\n00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.120\nsay, okay to that.\n\n416\n00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.640\nNow as soon as I do that,\nlook what happened to my little picture.\n\n417\n00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.520\nRight?\nI got this crazy blue line,\n\n418\n00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.770\na little ant trail going\nbetween the two locations.\n\n419\n00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.680\nIt's setting up my replication.\n\n420\n00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.400\nIt's spinning up a server in US Central,\n\n421\n00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:18.560\nit's creating a copy of my sample\ndatabase and that's copying right now.\n\n422\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.790\nAnd it's not redundant right now.\n\n423\n00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.570\nNot until I see a check\nmark in both locations.\n\n424\n00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:28.180\nWhen I have check marks in both locations,\nI've now got geo-redunancy.\n\n425\n00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:33.080\nIf this entire data center fails,\nright now, if it dies outright.\n\n426\n00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.680\nThere's a full copy of my database\nin lockstep, in real time,\n\n427\n00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.880\nright up there in US\ncentral that's ready to go.\n\n428\n00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.770\nAnd Microsoft will detect the failure and\nactivate it for me.\n\n429\n00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.000\nI don't have to do it.\n\n430\n00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.560\nIt just happens.\n\n431\n00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.100\nAmazon Web Services has the exact same\nthing for their relational database, or\n\n432\n00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.220\nRDS system.\n\n433\n00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.160\nSo, if you go and spin up MySQL, or\n\n434\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.760\nOracle, or even Microsoft SQL,\nin Amazon's RDS, same thing, right?\n\n435\n00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.060\nThis one looks prettier,\nAmazon's is not as flashy.\n\n436\n00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.930\nThis one you get an animated line.\n\n437\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.950\nSo, if you like animated lines,\nAzure's the way to go.\n\n438\n00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.550\nBut, both services provide\na very similar function here.\n\n439\n00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:08.870\nIt's gonna build that copy up.\n\n440\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.460\nMy sample database is pretty small.\n\n441\n00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.020\nI think it's a gig,\nprobably about a gig in size.\n\n442\n00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.040\nAnd so, it should send that data\nover relatively quickly, and\n\n443\n00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.160\nthen get it launched out.\n\n444\n00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.730\nAnd then, we'll have georeplication.\n\n445\n00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.130\nSo, was it hard to set that up?\n\n446\n00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.762\nNo, cause I leveraged the Cloud.\n\n447\n00:21:23.762 --> 00:21:25.826\nNow, let's say I didn't leverage a cloud,\nall right,\n\n448\n00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.990\nlet's say that I was\njust a private company.\n\n449\n00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.010\nITProTV, we got our studios,\nright here in Gainesville.\n\n450\n00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.090\nAnd maybe, I have a database\nsitting beside me on a server,\n\n451\n00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.730\ncuz that's a great place to put it, and\nI want a copy up there in US central.\n\n452\n00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.470\nWell, I gotta call up to Nebraska and\nfind data centers that are up there.\n\n453\n00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.270\nAnd then I gotta talk to them, I gotta\nfind who's running a good data center\n\n454\n00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.820\nverses a bad one,\ncause I don't know these companies.\n\n455\n00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:49.380\nSo I had to go through a whole bidding\nprocess and an RFP and all that stuff.\n\n456\n00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.510\nAnd when I finally select one, I've got\nto buy a server and send it up to them.\n\n457\n00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.540\nAnd say, all right,\nI need you to power this server on.\n\n458\n00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.730\nAnd then, every time I need somebody\nto do something on that server,\n\n459\n00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:57.640\nI've got to call them up.\n\n460\n00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.730\nHey, can you power that server off,\nor power it on.\n\n461\n00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.340\nCan you change out this adapter?\n\n462\n00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.620\nI've got to rely on that.\n\n463\n00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.340\nAnd I've got to go through getting\nall that set up, and monitoring and\n\n464\n00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:05.860\nmaintaining it.\n\n465\n00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.390\nAnd it's a lot of work, right?\n\n466\n00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.850\nIt's a lot of effort.\n\n467\n00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.950\nBut, once it's done, you get that, right?\n\n468\n00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.070\nAnd that's why people are intimidated,\n\n469\n00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.060\nbecause they know how\nmuch effort that takes.\n\n470\n00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.860\nBut with a cloud service like this, where\nMicrosoft already has the data center up\n\n471\n00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.990\nthere waiting for me, I just activate it,\nand then it all happens on the back end.\n\n472\n00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:26.580\nSo georeplication like this with\na cloud service is really beneficial.\n\n473\n00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.160\nAnd there we go, yep, I'm in lockstep.\n\n474\n00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.910\nI've got this read copy that's\njust sitting there, and\n\n475\n00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.980\nif I ever have a failure,\nI can jump right over to it.\n\n476\n00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.550\nSo now,\nwhen I go over to my sequel databases, and\n\n477\n00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.390\nI pick my sample DB1, right?\n\n478\n00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.000\nSample DB1 has that replica,\n\n479\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.600\nit's available and we could even\nfail over to it, if we needed to and\n\n480\n00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.680\ntest that out and you wanna test, you\nwanna fail over and check those things and\n\n481\n00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.712\nthe fail back is configured by\nMicrosoft and all ready to go.\n\n482\n00:22:54.712 --> 00:22:58.760\nSo, definitely intimidating but\nnot that hard to do.\n\n483\n00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.980\n>> So, you've got it set up.\n\n484\n00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.050\nIs there anything?\n\n485\n00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.420\nCan we walk set it and forget it now?\n\n486\n00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.220\nWalk away from it?\n\n487\n00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.298\nWe're insured and nothing left to do?\n\n488\n00:23:05.298 --> 00:23:07.210\n>> Well, you gotta monitor it, right?\n\n489\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:08.840\nYou gotta know if something's\ngoing wrong in the network.\n\n490\n00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.045\nYou gotta know if you failed over.\n\n491\n00:23:10.045 --> 00:23:12.138\nCuz your end users aren't\ngoing to see it anymore.\n\n492\n00:23:12.138 --> 00:23:13.080\nThe fail over happens, and\n\n493\n00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.130\nit's all transparent to them,\nso you've gotta monitor it.\n\n494\n00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.690\nKind of tabs that.\n\n495\n00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:21.530\nNow, another thing worth mentioning is,\nyou might not need Geo Replication, you\n\n496\n00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.790\nmight be replicating between more than one\nsystem, right here on your own network.\n\n497\n00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:27.750\nMaybe I have a web server that's really\nimportant to me, so I have a second\n\n498\n00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.540\nweb server sitting right next to it, two\nphysical boxes, or two virtual machines\n\n499\n00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.900\nfor that matter, and when I make\nchanges to the web page on one server.\n\n500\n00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.200\nI make the change on the other server too,\nso\n\n501\n00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.070\nthey've got the same copy of the web page.\n\n502\n00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.970\nYou probably automate it,\n\n503\n00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.520\nuse something like rsync or something\nlike that to synchronize those files.\n\n504\n00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.520\nWell, if I wanna take advantage\nof this second set of hardware,\n\n505\n00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.260\nI should really set up load balancing,\nright?\n\n506\n00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.380\nWe wanna be able to load\nbalance between the two.\n\n507\n00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.911\nAnd some operating systems\nhave load balancing built in.\n\n508\n00:23:53.911 --> 00:23:55.804\nA lot of operating systems don't,\n\n509\n00:23:55.804 --> 00:23:58.588\ncuz they expect you to use\na hardware load balancer.\n\n510\n00:23:58.588 --> 00:24:02.507\nIn Microsoft Azure you have\nwhat are called Cloud Services.\n\n511\n00:24:02.507 --> 00:24:06.409\nAnd when you build a cloud service, it\nwraps up more than one virtual machine and\n\n512\n00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:08.770\nlets you load bounce across them.\n\n513\n00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.780\nIn Amazon Web Services you have load\nbalancing sets that you can build.\n\n514\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.710\nAnd with the load balancers,\nyou deploy a cloud load balancer, and\n\n515\n00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.760\nyou put your instances inside\nof it to balance across.\n\n516\n00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.610\nIn your own nodes,\nif you deploy them locally,\n\n517\n00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.240\nyou don't have that advantage, right?\n\n518\n00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.437\nSo you can use a hardware\nload balancer like F5,\n\n519\n00:24:24.437 --> 00:24:27.877\nthey make a bunch of really great load\nbalancers that are really expensive.\n\n520\n00:24:27.877 --> 00:24:31.443\nThere's software load balancers that you\ncan do, you can bring up a Linux Box and\n\n521\n00:24:31.443 --> 00:24:34.290\nuse it as a load balancer or\nyou can rely on the operating system.\n\n522\n00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:38.741\nAnd so like Windows, there's something\ncalled Windows Load Balancing Services,\n\n523\n00:24:38.741 --> 00:24:40.942\nWLBS, or Network Load Balancing, NLB.\n\n524\n00:24:40.942 --> 00:24:43.705\nIt's the same thing,\nthere's two different names for it.\n\n525\n00:24:43.705 --> 00:24:44.525\nAnd you can deploy that and\n\n526\n00:24:44.525 --> 00:24:47.065\nyou can create what's called\na Network Load Balancing Cluster.\n\n527\n00:24:47.065 --> 00:24:49.595\nIt's basically a cluster\nwithout shared storage.\n\n528\n00:24:49.595 --> 00:24:53.010\nIt's a cluster that expects you to be\nsynchronizing your storage some other way.\n\n529\n00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.650\nAnd if one node fails,\nthe other one can take over.\n\n530\n00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.130\nI'll put some notes on it in the show\nnotes so you guys can see it,\n\n531\n00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:02.810\nbut network load balancing is really\njust a Microsoft only thing, or NLB is.\n\n532\n00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.680\nThe concept of load balancing\nthough is all over the place.\n\n533\n00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.105\nSo for example, here in Azure, I'll\njust use Azure, cuz I'm already in it.\n\n534\n00:25:09.105 --> 00:25:13.239\nJust to kinda set the precedence here,\nright?\n\n535\n00:25:13.239 --> 00:25:15.549\nI usually use AWS,\nthat's what my go to service, so\n\n536\n00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:18.604\nI'm trying to be a little fair and\nuse Azure here in the show some too.\n\n537\n00:25:18.604 --> 00:25:22.772\nBut in Azure, if I go through and\nstart creating virtual machines, right?\n\n538\n00:25:22.772 --> 00:25:25.653\nSo if I whip up a VM,\nlooks like I've already got one, but\n\n539\n00:25:25.653 --> 00:25:27.106\nI'll just whip up a new one.\n\n540\n00:25:27.106 --> 00:25:31.366\nIf I whip up a VM, by default it's\nperforming some kind of service and,\n\n541\n00:25:31.366 --> 00:25:34.774\nactually let me use,\nI'm gonna use the classic portal,\n\n542\n00:25:34.774 --> 00:25:37.055\nbecause it's a little easier to see.\n\n543\n00:25:37.055 --> 00:25:40.842\nMicrosoft has two portals for managing\nAzure, the new portal and the old portal.\n\n544\n00:25:40.842 --> 00:25:43.628\nIn the old portal actually made\nthings a little bit easier to spot.\n\n545\n00:25:43.628 --> 00:25:49.094\nIf I wanna whip up a server in here\nI can create a cloud service and\n\n546\n00:25:49.094 --> 00:25:51.994\nI can put multiple servers in it.\n\n547\n00:25:51.994 --> 00:25:54.710\nAnd then I can configure those\nservers to start load balancing.\n\n548\n00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.010\nSo, I'm gonna start by\ndeploying a virtual machine,\n\n549\n00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.065\nactually you can see my\nsample data bases there.\n\n550\n00:25:59.065 --> 00:26:01.017\nI'm gonna create a virtual machine, and\n\n551\n00:26:01.017 --> 00:26:03.090\nthis will just be like a web server,\nright?\n\n552\n00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:08.377\nSo, I'm gonna create one\nwhich ill call ITproTV-web01,\n\n553\n00:26:08.377 --> 00:26:13.981\nI'll make it a Windows server and\nI'll give myself a log in to it.\n\n554\n00:26:13.981 --> 00:26:18.962\nAnd so we'll get that set and\nwe'll stick it, we'll go East US, why not.\n\n555\n00:26:18.962 --> 00:26:22.505\nAnd actually it's gonna create a cloud\nservice for it that's gonna name it\n\n556\n00:26:22.505 --> 00:26:25.990\nsomething other than what I wanna name it,\nso maybe I need to create this,\n\n557\n00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.050\nthe Azure portal is not the most\nconvenient thing in the planet.\n\n558\n00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.600\nSo let me switch over to the gallery view\ninstead and I'll create it this way.\n\n559\n00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.990\nSo I'm gonna create it\na little bit different.\n\n560\n00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.903\nBut I'm gonna create itprotv-web01.\n\n561\n00:26:35.903 --> 00:26:39.257\nAnd when I go to create it,\nit's gonna ask me the size, right?\n\n562\n00:26:39.257 --> 00:26:42.420\nHow many processors,\nhow much memory, and so on.\n\n563\n00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.130\nIt's gonna ask for a user name.\n\n564\n00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.840\nIt's gonna ask for a password.\n\n565\n00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.110\nSo I'll punch in a password and\n\n566\n00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:54.110\nthen, oops, it's gonna ask for a few other\npieces of information as we go through.\n\n567\n00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:58.340\nIt's gonna ask about that cloud service,\nif I wanna combine multiple machines in\n\n568\n00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.430\na one cloud service, I need to do it\nhere and I wanted to change that name.\n\n569\n00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:02.500\nThat's why I stopped the other wizard.\n\n570\n00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.910\nI'm just gonna call itprotv-web.\n\n571\n00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.160\nWhere do I wanted to be?\n\n572\n00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.260\nI'll go East US, I'm fine with that.\n\n573\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.590\nWhat storage account do I wanna use?\n\n574\n00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.900\nI can use an existing account if I've\ngot one or I can generate a new one.\n\n575\n00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.140\nAnd then an availability set.\n\n576\n00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.640\nAll right, what is that?\n\n577\n00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.900\nWell when I deploy virtual\nmachines in Azure or\n\n578\n00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.210\nAWS for this matter, your VMs could\nin theory be on the same hardware.\n\n579\n00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:29.810\nIt is possible that I could spin up two\nVMs and they end up on the same hardware.\n\n580\n00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.330\nAnd if that hardware fails,\nboth my VMs go down.\n\n581\n00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.340\nIf I'm trying to create\nredundancy I don't want that.\n\n582\n00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:38.450\nSo I can create an availability set, and\nwith the availability set I can say,\n\n583\n00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.810\nas I deploy VMs into\nthis availability set,\n\n584\n00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.065\nmake sure they're on different hardware,\nplease.\n\n585\n00:27:43.065 --> 00:27:44.910\nAnd on Microsoft's end,\nthey'll know that now.\n\n586\n00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:48.440\nThey'll say these are two related systems,\nI need to put them on different hardware.\n\n587\n00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.490\nOtherwise, you run that risk of\nlosing both at the same time.\n\n588\n00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.710\nIt's one of those things we\nassume that they do for us, but\n\n589\n00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.100\nthey don't know our software.\n\n590\n00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.671\nThey don't know how we use this stuff,\nand so they don't do it.\n\n591\n00:27:57.671 --> 00:27:59.563\nYou've got to know to turn it on,\nthat's important.\n\n592\n00:27:59.563 --> 00:28:02.780\nAll right, then my endpoints.\n\n593\n00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.950\nIf this is gonna be a web server,\n\n594\n00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.370\nI need to have HTTP port 80 available for\nit, right?\n\n595\n00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.201\nSo I might come in here and\nchoose to add that in.\n\n596\n00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:13.304\nBut the problem is, when I add that in,\n\n597\n00:28:13.304 --> 00:28:17.547\nwell only one server can\nanswer on port 80, right?\n\n598\n00:28:17.547 --> 00:28:20.650\nI'm gonna have to configure a load\nbalancing set to be able to load balance\n\n599\n00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.765\nbetween these systems and\nI'll do it in a moment.\n\n600\n00:28:22.765 --> 00:28:24.579\nI'm not gonna do it here cuz\nI've only got one system,\n\n601\n00:28:24.579 --> 00:28:26.007\nthere's not much to load balance across.\n\n602\n00:28:26.007 --> 00:28:30.139\nSo I'll just leave that be and\nfinish that little wizard.\n\n603\n00:28:30.139 --> 00:28:33.018\nAll right, so it's gonna deploy that\nvirtual machine now it's got a lot to do.\n\n604\n00:28:33.018 --> 00:28:36.381\nIt's got to create the cloud service and\nthen it's got to create the VM,\n\n605\n00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:39.140\nthen it's gotta pay attention\nto the availability zone and\n\n606\n00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.590\nall that mess and\nget it kind of all pieced together.\n\n607\n00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:42.850\nSo it's gonna do that.\n\n608\n00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.900\nAs soon as its done I can deploy a second\nnode, a third, a fourth, a fifth,\n\n609\n00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.290\na hundred nodes.\n\n610\n00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:51.300\nAnd, well you have this artificial\nlimit of 20 in Azure by default, so\n\n611\n00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.510\nI'll have to do a support\nticket when I hit 20.\n\n612\n00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:57.070\nBut I can deploy nodes, and I can put\nthem right in the same cloud service.\n\n613\n00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.180\nAnd I can create a load balance set, so\nthat when somebody browses to the cloud\n\n614\n00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.840\nservice, they get balanced\nacross any node inside of there.\n\n615\n00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.682\nAnd if a node fails,\nif it goes offline, that's okay.\n\n616\n00:29:06.682 --> 00:29:09.096\nCuz the other nodes pick up the slack,\nright?\n\n617\n00:29:09.096 --> 00:29:11.570\nI get my redundancy,\nI get my high availability.\n\n618\n00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:13.840\nNobody even notices that node go down.\n\n619\n00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.630\nAnd then I can increase and decrease my\ncapacity, so that if I have a peak time.\n\n620\n00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:22.450\nLike it's I'm a retail organization and\nwe have a lot of sales in the wintertime.\n\n621\n00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.150\nSo I add five more servers\nduring the winter.\n\n622\n00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.600\nAnd then January rolls around and\nI take those five servers back out again.\n\n623\n00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.196\nAnd I get back down to however many\nI have for the rest of the year.\n\n624\n00:29:29.196 --> 00:29:30.838\nWe start to have that flexibility,\n\n625\n00:29:30.838 --> 00:29:33.366\nbecause it is all hidden\nbehind this infrastructure.\n\n626\n00:29:33.366 --> 00:29:36.756\nAll right, and this is the part where\nI wait impatiently for it to deploy.\n\n627\n00:29:36.756 --> 00:29:39.042\nBut it will deploy eventually.\n\n628\n00:29:39.042 --> 00:29:43.054\nYou have to be careful when you\ndeploy an availability set like this,\n\n629\n00:29:43.054 --> 00:29:45.557\nthat can only be set\nwhen you create the VM.\n\n630\n00:29:45.557 --> 00:29:47.809\nSo I kind of want to create\nmy second VM right now.\n\n631\n00:29:47.809 --> 00:29:51.358\nBut if that availability set doesn't\nexist yet, I can't get into it, so\n\n632\n00:29:51.358 --> 00:29:54.866\nI've gotta wait for this one to provision\nbefore I can add my second one.\n\n633\n00:29:54.866 --> 00:29:58.187\nThat's the type of information you get\nby reading your vendor documentation.\n\n634\n00:29:58.187 --> 00:30:01.672\nAll right, I'm showing you this in Asure,\nif you're doing this is AWS,\n\n635\n00:30:01.672 --> 00:30:02.586\nit's different.\n\n636\n00:30:02.586 --> 00:30:04.491\nIf you do it in Google Compute\nit's different,\n\n637\n00:30:04.491 --> 00:30:06.158\nyou've gotta read your documentation,\n\n638\n00:30:06.158 --> 00:30:09.175\nyou've gotta make sure that you\nunderstand the nuances of each provider.\n\n639\n00:30:09.175 --> 00:30:11.860\nAll right,\nlooks like it's about to finish here.\n\n640\n00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.160\nSo I'm gonna spin up my next instance.\n\n641\n00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.494\nAnd so\nI'm gonna create another virtual machine.\n\n642\n00:30:16.494 --> 00:30:19.383\nAnd I'm basically gonna configure\nthis one the same way, right?\n\n643\n00:30:19.383 --> 00:30:23.790\nThis one's gonna be ITProTV-web02.\n\n644\n00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:29.370\nAnd I can, as I deploy this I can choose\nto put it in a different region if I want,\n\n645\n00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.180\nI'm gonna keep these in same region.\n\n646\n00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:35.310\nI'm gonna keep them in the same region cuz\nit's really rare for a region to fail but\n\n647\n00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.410\nit does happen, it's usually a routing\nissue so it's resolved pretty quickly but\n\n648\n00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:39.550\nit can happen.\n\n649\n00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:43.290\nI'm gonna put it in that cloud service\nthat we used a moment ago and so\n\n650\n00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.209\nsee how it's kinda locking\nme into that region?\n\n651\n00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:50.792\nAnd then from here I can pick my storage\naccount and my availability set.\n\n652\n00:30:50.792 --> 00:30:53.880\nThat's gonna make sure I end\nup on different hardware.\n\n653\n00:30:53.880 --> 00:31:00.160\nNow, if I try and add HTTP as an endpoint,\nsee how I get this error?\n\n654\n00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.766\nSomebody else is already\nmonitoring port 80.\n\n655\n00:31:01.766 --> 00:31:04.459\nI can't monitor port 80 also,\nsomebody else already has it.\n\n656\n00:31:04.459 --> 00:31:06.452\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna have to come back and\n\n657\n00:31:06.452 --> 00:31:09.132\nadd that in a moment once I have\na load balancing set in place.\n\n658\n00:31:09.132 --> 00:31:11.744\nOkay, but for\nright now I'm just gonna leave that off.\n\n659\n00:31:11.744 --> 00:31:12.905\nThis is gonna be a web server\nthat no one can get to.\n\n660\n00:31:12.905 --> 00:31:13.741\nIt's kinda pointless.\n\n661\n00:31:13.741 --> 00:31:16.654\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nprovision that one.\n\n662\n00:31:16.654 --> 00:31:17.375\nAll right, so there it goes.\n\n663\n00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:20.380\nNow while it's provisioning,\nI can go and check out my other one and\n\n664\n00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.234\nfix that adapter.\n\n665\n00:31:21.234 --> 00:31:25.405\nSo I'm gonna take the itprotv-web01,\nthat's the first node that I made, and\n\n666\n00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:26.619\nwhen I go into that one.\n\n667\n00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:29.968\nI can come in here and\ncheck at my endpoints.\n\n668\n00:31:29.968 --> 00:31:32.282\nAnd here is that TCP port 80,\n\n669\n00:31:32.282 --> 00:31:37.095\nthat first web server is bound\nto port 80 for this web service.\n\n670\n00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:43.897\nAnd I can edit that I can't edit it,\nbecause the node is booting up still.\n\n671\n00:31:43.897 --> 00:31:46.273\nSo, I need to wait for\nthat node to finish booting up and\n\n672\n00:31:46.273 --> 00:31:49.952\nas soon as that node is booted up, yeah\nsee, it still says Running, Provisioning.\n\n673\n00:31:49.952 --> 00:31:53.261\nAs soon as that's done,\nI'll be able to edit that end point.\n\n674\n00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:56.219\nAnd all I have to do is\ntell it yes you import 80.\n\n675\n00:31:56.219 --> 00:32:00.253\nBut it's in a load balance set, I had\nto tell it that it's load balancing and\n\n676\n00:32:00.253 --> 00:32:03.845\nonce that's done, I can go and\ntell the other one to join that set and\n\n677\n00:32:03.845 --> 00:32:08.650\nnow I'm load balancing between this 2\nnodes there, just switch to running.\n\n678\n00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:14.930\nSo, let's go up to my end points and\nnow I can choose that it, there we go and\n\n679\n00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:20.230\nso I've got HTTP,\nport 80 create a load balance set, right?\n\n680\n00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.360\nI'm going to check that right there.\n\n681\n00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.445\nCreate a load balance set and now I can\njust give it a name which I'll call\n\n682\n00:32:24.445 --> 00:32:29.220\nITPROTV-web since this is my web\nservice and it's TCP port 80.\n\n683\n00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.560\nNow notice these probes down here.\n\n684\n00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.090\nHow does it know if a node goes offline,\nif a node fails?\n\n685\n00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.040\nIt probes it.\n\n686\n00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.140\nIt checks,\ncan I connect to that system on port 80?\n\n687\n00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:44.220\nIt's a web traffic, right and if it can't,\nthe nodes down stop sending traffic to it.\n\n688\n00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.400\nDon't load balance to a host that's down.\n\n689\n00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.840\nThat's the big advantage\nof a load balancer.\n\n690\n00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.880\nIt set the probe every 15 seconds, and\n\n691\n00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.830\nif 2 probes fail,\nthen we stop sending traffic to it.\n\n692\n00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:59.890\nWell, if I check every 15 seconds and\nI fail 2 probes, that's 30 seconds.\n\n693\n00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:01.120\nI could be down for 30 seconds.\n\n694\n00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.940\nI'd be sending some of my users to\na server that's down for 30 seconds.\n\n695\n00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.380\nI might wanna reduce that.\n\n696\n00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.077\nSo maybe I drop it to 5 seconds, right.\n\n697\n00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:13.690\nNow I prove every 5 seconds, and if I\nget 2 failures, then I flag it as down.\n\n698\n00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:15.788\nNow I could be down for ten seconds.\n\n699\n00:33:15.788 --> 00:33:17.280\nThat's shorter, right or\n\n700\n00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.990\nI might want to increase it just to\nreduce the burden on my servers.\n\n701\n00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.850\nYou can do that, but\nI'll leave it nice and low here.\n\n702\n00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:28.520\nAnd then I'll check that off and\ntechnically, I've got a load balancer.\n\n703\n00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.010\nI've got a load balancer with one note\nin it but I've got a load balancer,\n\n704\n00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:32.240\nthat's exciting, right.\n\n705\n00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:36.290\nSo all of my traffic is being\nload balanced to this one host.\n\n706\n00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:40.160\nWell what I need to do now or\nguest, is I need to take that other\n\n707\n00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.300\nguest which I don't know if that's\ndone yet, it's not done yet but\n\n708\n00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.970\nas soon as it's done I'll be able\nto add it to that load balance set.\n\n709\n00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.360\nAnd now, I've got hardware redundancy,\n\n710\n00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.180\nbecause my two nodes are in\nthe same availability zone, so\n\n711\n00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.970\nthey are available in a set, so it knows\nto move them to different hardware.\n\n712\n00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:59.590\nAnd I'm load balancing across them,\nso if the hardware for\n\n713\n00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.310\none nodes dies,\nthe other one still up and running.\n\n714\n00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:04.700\nI just send one hundred percent of\nmy traffic to the other node and\n\n715\n00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.510\nI could continue adding systems to it.\n\n716\n00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.000\nThere you go, web o two is done, so\n\n717\n00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.570\nif I jump over to web o two I\ndon't have an end point for http.\n\n718\n00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.400\nSo, if I come in here and add an end\npoint, its asking do I wanted to add\n\n719\n00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.220\na stand alone endpoint or\nadd it to load balanced set.\n\n720\n00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.030\nAnd I'm gonna add it itprotv-web.\n\n721\n00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:26.020\nThat's a load balanced set that\nI made just a moment ago and\n\n722\n00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.630\nI'll just finish that up.\n\n723\n00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.400\nAnd there.\n\n724\n00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.340\nActually expects me to name it.\n\n725\n00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.040\nHow dare it.\n\n726\n00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.320\nAll right, so I'm going to go ahead and\ngive it a name.\n\n727\n00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.500\nThat's exciting.\n\n728\n00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.475\nSo I'll check that off.\n\n729\n00:34:35.475 --> 00:34:38.720\n[LAUGH] The things we have to\ndo to configure this stuff.\n\n730\n00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.200\nSo, I'll give it that configuration, and\n\n731\n00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.250\nnow, as soon as this update\nin progress goes away,\n\n732\n00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:48.020\nI'm load balancing between these two nodes\nI'm getting two nodes doing the work on\n\n733\n00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.700\nscaling out right to go back to\nthe terminology from episode number one.\n\n734\n00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.730\nI'm scaling out I've got\nmore than one web server.\n\n735\n00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:59.300\nIf one server fails, the other one takes\nover I've got high availability, right and\n\n736\n00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.280\nI've got scalability if these two servers\nget too busy I can just add another server\n\n737\n00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.570\nnow I've got three,\nadd another one now I've got four, five,\n\n738\n00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:10.580\nsix, continue adding to them and\nI've got hardware redundancy, I've got\n\n739\n00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:14.490\nextra bandwidth for having multiple nodes\nthat are running, I've got resiliency, and\n\n740\n00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.570\nI've done all this without filling\nout a single purchase order, right?\n\n741\n00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.140\nI didn't have to order\nanything in the mail,\n\n742\n00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:22.100\nservers didn't have to be shipped to me,\nI don't have warranties to worry about.\n\n743\n00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.880\nThis is the real exciting part about\nthe cloud is you have access to levels of\n\n744\n00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.280\nredundancy that you would never have\naccess to in a physical environment where\n\n745\n00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.420\nyou are having to set all this stuff up\nyourself, here it's all taken care of for\n\n746\n00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:37.950\nus and when I take a look at that\ncloud service my web server right.\n\n747\n00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:41.390\nWhen I go into that cloud service and\nI start taking a look at here,\n\n748\n00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:45.570\nI'll see that I've got nice redundancy and\nconfiguration in place.\n\n749\n00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.990\nIf I go into my instances I can see that\n\n750\n00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:51.950\nI've got my servers in two\ndifferent update domains and\n\n751\n00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:56.460\ntwo different fault domains, so if I have\na physical failure at Azure, I'm covered.\n\n752\n00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.420\nMy two nodes are safe.\n\n753\n00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.390\nThey're up and\nthey're in those different areas.\n\n754\n00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.630\nAnd now,\nwe've got a pretty robust appointment.\n\n755\n00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:03.540\n>> Very good and keep in mind,\n\n756\n00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:07.550\nin disaster recovery we've been looking\nat a multitude of different concepts.\n\n757\n00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:11.340\nHere in part three we've been looking at\nthings like MPIO, we've also showed you\n\n758\n00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:15.510\nhow to set up things like georeplication,\nand then finally network load balancing.\n\n759\n00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.820\nThanks for that information Don.\n\n760\n00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:19.360\nAny other information for\ndisaster recovery?\n\n761\n00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.580\n>> Read, read.\n\n762\n00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.840\nThere are so many different, I've shown\nyou guys some of the popular ones, but\n\n763\n00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.800\nthere's far more and I'm talking\nabout replicating servers right?\n\n764\n00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.790\nThere's replication for applications too.\n\n765\n00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.930\nYou might have specific programs\nthat have their own replication\n\n766\n00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:34.000\nbuilt right into them.\n\n767\n00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.490\nSo read understand the features and\n\n768\n00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.790\nwhat's available in the solutions\nthat you're trying to manage.\n\n769\n00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.290\nCuz you may have options that\naren't available to normal people\n\n770\n00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:43.010\nbecause your software\nhas special features.\n\n771\n00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:45.970\n>> Great information, and it looks\nlike we've come to the end of another\n\n772\n00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:49.840\nexciting episode here at IT Pro TV, so I'm\ngonna go ahead and sign out for us here.\n\n773\n00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.460\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n774\n00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.160\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n775\n00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.865\n>> And we'll see you
