          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:09.464\n[SOUND]\n\n2\n00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:10.246\nIn this video,\n\n3\n00:00:10.246 --> 00:00:14.050\nwe're gonna be looking at CompTIA's\nCloud+, and I have Don Pezet here.\n\n4\n00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.368\nDon, tell us a little bit about Cloud+.\n\n5\n00:00:16.368 --> 00:00:20.620\n>> The Cloud+ certification is one of the\nnewer certifications to come from CompTIA.\n\n6\n00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.990\nAnd it's designed to help certify and\n\n7\n00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.330\nvalidate your knowledge in\nthe area of cloud computing.\n\n8\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.580\nCloud's a big buzzword right now,\na lot of people are deploying these.\n\n9\n00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.130\nAnd they're deploying public clouds\nlike with Amazon Web Services,\n\n10\n00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.600\nMicrosoft Azure, Google Compute,\nthose type technologies.\n\n11\n00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.620\nAnd they're also deploying private clouds,\nclouds\n\n12\n00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.000\nthat you build in your own organization\nwith technologies like VMware VSphere,\n\n13\n00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.650\nMicrosoft's Hyper-V, Citrix Xenserver,\nthose types of technologies.\n\n14\n00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.550\nWell, you have to have a certain amount of\nknowledge to support that infrastructure\n\n15\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.000\nand that's exactly what CompTIA's Cloud+\ncovers, is making sure that\n\n16\n00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.820\nyou've got the necessary knowledge and\nskills to manage the servers yourself or\n\n17\n00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.730\nto determine when you\nshould outsource that and\n\n18\n00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.340\nlet one of the big cloud providers\non the internet handle that.\n\n19\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.670\nAnd even how to do a hybrid between the\ntwo, where you manage some resources and\n\n20\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.790\nthey manage others.\n\n21\n00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.550\nWell obviously there is a lot of\nresponsibility that comes in whichever\n\n22\n00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.360\nmodel you choose and so\nthat's exactly what we cover in Cloud+.\n\n23\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.440\nAll the underlying hardware technologies,\n\n24\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.420\nthe software,\nthe logistics of deploying the technology.\n\n25\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.640\nIt's very different from the traditional\nphysical server model, and\n\n26\n00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.250\nso the Cloud+ is designed\nto create that separation.\n\n27\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.850\nIt's not the old way of doing things,\nit's a new way, and\n\n28\n00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.418\nhere's all the different\ntechnologies you might see.\n\n29\n00:01:37.418 --> 00:01:41.310\n>> Don, now Cloud+,\nwith all the CompTIA exams,\n\n30\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.000\nthey always have a certain target audience\n\n31\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.790\nWith Cloud+ can you tell us a little bit\nabout, who is the target on this one?\n\n32\n00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.520\n>> If we pull up the official exam\nguide from CompTIA here, basically they\n\n33\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.105\nstate what they're looking for is that\nif you're gonna be jumping into Cloud+,\n\n34\n00:01:57.105 --> 00:02:02.035\nthey expect you to already be Network+\nand/or CompTIA Storage+ certified, right?\n\n35\n00:02:02.035 --> 00:02:05.625\nThey expect you to already have some\nexperience with supporting networking.\n\n36\n00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.325\nAnd networking applies in storage and\nregular networks.\n\n37\n00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:10.975\nIt's not required, but\nthey want you to have that knowledge.\n\n38\n00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:12.805\nSo you should already\nbe familiar with that.\n\n39\n00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:17.830\nThey also want you to have 24 to 36 months\nof work experience in IT networking.\n\n40\n00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.320\nThis is not designed for\nsomebody who's brand new to IT.\n\n41\n00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.770\nThis is designed for\nsomebody who's already in the IT world,\n\n42\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.530\nis already working with systems,\nmaybe locally, maybe in the cloud,\n\n43\n00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.120\nthat wants to know more, that wants\nto be ready for that new technology.\n\n44\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.850\nIn IT, things change so fast and\nif you're not updating your skills,\n\n45\n00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.110\nyou can become outdated very,\nvery quickly.\n\n46\n00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.460\nYour skill set becomes outdated and\n\n47\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.070\nthat makes you less marketable\nas an IT professional.\n\n48\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.300\nWell, Cloud+ is focused on what's new,\nthe new way of doing things,\n\n49\n00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.690\njumping into those technologies and\nembracing them, and so\n\n50\n00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.540\nthat's why it's geared towards\npeople that are already in IT.\n\n51\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.420\nThat already have that Network+ level of\nknowledge so that we can jump right in and\n\n52\n00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.400\nfocus on the important stuff, the what's\nnew, the virtualization technologies, and\n\n53\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.280\nnot have to focus on things like,\nhey, here's how we do subnetting.\n\n54\n00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.220\nWe should already know that\nknowledge by this point.\n\n55\n00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.070\n>> As with every CompTIA exam,\n\n56\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.290\nthere's gonna be a series of\nobjectives you have to know.\n\n57\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.370\nDon, here in Cloud+,\n\n58\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.860\nwhat are some of the topics that we can\nexpect to learn across this journey?\n\n59\n00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.560\n>> Well they break everything\nup across seven domains, and\n\n60\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.160\nI've got it here on the slide where,\nbasically each topic is pretty important.\n\n61\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.330\nAnd I know on some CompTIA exams you'll\nhave where one domain counts for\n\n62\n00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.620\n40% of the exam but in Cloud+ it's\nactually a pretty even distribution.\n\n63\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.830\nWe start with just cloud concepts and\nmodels.\n\n64\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.730\nA lot of people have misunderstanding\nof what a cloud is, and and\n\n65\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.060\nthey just automatically assume it means\nsomething like Amazon Web Services.\n\n66\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.210\nBut you have private clouds that are\nentirely internal that are just in your\n\n67\n00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.200\norganization.\n\n68\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.570\nAnd so we talk about those\ndifferent concepts and models,\n\n69\n00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.380\nthe different implementations\nthat you may see out there.\n\n70\n00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.120\nThen we do virtualization.\n\n71\n00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.480\nWhat is virtualization, and why would\nwe wanna go to a cloud when we've got\n\n72\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.970\nperfectly good physical servers already?\n\n73\n00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.950\nAnd so we cover that,\nwe cover what's that big difference and\n\n74\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.210\nwhy one gives us advantages over another.\n\n75\n00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.220\nThen we talk about our infrastructure.\n\n76\n00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.230\nWhat resources do I have to have\navailable to make this all work?\n\n77\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.790\nI'm gonna need different hardware,\n\n78\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.816\ndifferent networking, different storage\nthan a traditional server environment, and\n\n79\n00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:15.380\nso we take a look at\nthat infrastructure too.\n\n80\n00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.550\nIn domain four we've got\nresource management.\n\n81\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.500\nWhen we start lumping all of our servers\ninto this virtual environment it's\n\n82\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.550\neasy to lose track of how much RAM, CPU,\nnetwork and disk resources that we've got.\n\n83\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.060\nAnd we've got to be able to manage\nall of that and keep track of it and\n\n84\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.422\nkeep everything healthy.\n\n85\n00:04:30.422 --> 00:04:33.950\nAnd it's just a different world from\nthe old physical model where everything\n\n86\n00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.170\nhad dedicated resources.\n\n87\n00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.930\nDomain five is one of the more\nimportant ones, which is security.\n\n88\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.930\nWhen you start deploying this\nstuff into a cloud environment,\n\n89\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.270\nif it's a public cloud you can be at risk,\nand so\n\n90\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.790\nwe need to make sure we've secured\nour systems, that we've taken\n\n91\n00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.600\nthe necessary precautions to minimize\nour security risk in our attack surface.\n\n92\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.950\nAnd so we cover our topics too.\n\n93\n00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.160\nAs the show starts to wind down,\nwe get into the systems management.\n\n94\n00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.290\nOnce everything's up and running, we're\nnot just done, we don't walk away and\n\n95\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.310\ncall it a job done.\n\n96\n00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.690\nNow we've gotta keep it running.\n\n97\n00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.090\nSo how do we manage those systems and\nkeep them healthy and operational,\n\n98\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.860\nmonitoring performance and all that?\n\n99\n00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.750\nAnd then the last one, in domain seven,\n\n100\n00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.870\nwe cover what's really\nthe shining gem of a cloud.\n\n101\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.930\nWhen you have a cloud,\n\n102\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.510\nit is really easy to build in business\ncontinuity, disaster recovery,\n\n103\n00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.510\nresilience, high availability, we can\nbuild all of that into our infrastructure.\n\n104\n00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.190\nSo that we could lose a hard drive,\na power supply, a server,\n\n105\n00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.155\nan entire building, and still have our\nservices available to our customers.\n\n106\n00:05:35.155 --> 00:05:37.710\nThat we can have very\nhigh levels of redundancy\n\n107\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.920\nwith minimal commitment to hardware.\n\n108\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.300\nIt makes solutions that weren't\npossible for companies ten years ago,\n\n109\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.280\npossible even for companies with small\nbudgets, it's really neat stuff.\n\n110\n00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.254\nAnd those are all the different topics\nthat we're gonna be seeing on this exam.\n\n111\n00:05:51.254 --> 00:05:55.626\n>> So you've hit the books,\nyou've hit the internet, you've studied,\n\n112\n00:05:55.626 --> 00:06:00.286\nyou've gone through the motion of\nhopefully viewing us here at ITProTV, and\n\n113\n00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:03.880\nnow it's time to sit in the hot seat and\ntake the exam.\n\n114\n00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.600\nDon, how will we go\nabout taking that exam?\n\n115\n00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.150\n>> Well, the exam itself, it's a digital\nexam, you take it on a computer.\n\n116\n00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.000\nIt's a multiple choice exam for\nthe most part.\n\n117\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.190\nThere's some drag and\ndrop questions, things like that.\n\n118\n00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.390\nBut you can't just take\nit on your own computer.\n\n119\n00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.620\nYou have to go to\na Pearson Vue Testing Center.\n\n120\n00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.620\nSo Pearson Vue Centers,\nthey're all over the world.\n\n121\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.210\nIf you go to their website, it's vue.com.\n\n122\n00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.350\nIf you go to vue.com, you can do\na search for a test center right there,\n\n123\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.060\nyou'll find one in your local area.\n\n124\n00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.830\nYou can call them, schedule the exam,\nand go to take it.\n\n125\n00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.480\nAnd I've got the exam details here.\n\n126\n00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.288\nThe exam number is CV0-001,\nthat's the exam that you wanna take.\n\n127\n00:06:40.288 --> 00:06:45.060\nAnd it's 100 questions, so it's not so\nbad, but you've only got an hour and\n\n128\n00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.860\na half, you got 90 minutes.\n\n129\n00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.720\nNot if you look at that,\nthat's less than a minute per question.\n\n130\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.600\nSo when you get to this exam,\nyou need to know your answers.\n\n131\n00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.840\nThis isn't a, I'm gonna sit here and\n\n132\n00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.920\nponder it and think about it,\nI've got 50 seconds,\n\n133\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.390\nor whatever, per question to answer, and\nmake sure that I get through it on time.\n\n134\n00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.340\nIt's graded on a scale of 100 to 900,\nand a 750 is passing.\n\n135\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.210\nSo, you've got, where you can get\nsome questions wrong and still pass.\n\n136\n00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.980\nYou don't have a perfectionist, but\na 750's still a pretty high number.\n\n137\n00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.700\nWe need to make sure that\nwe know our material.\n\n138\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.140\nAnd so, when you go to the Vue's website\nand you find that local testing center, so\n\n139\n00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.250\nI'm just gonna go here to For\ntest takers, and once we're in here,\n\n140\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.100\nwe can tell it what exam we wanna take,\nand I'll just punch in CompTIA.\n\n141\n00:07:30.330 -->

test center, and I can\nlocate that test center that's near me.\n\n144\n00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.470\nSo we can pick a city.\n\n145\n00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:46.120\nLet's pick somewhere,\nI don't know, we'll do London.\n\n146\n00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.950\nI guess that's a really big city but\nwell either way we can just do London.\n\n147\n00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.700\nAnd so we'll do a search for\n\n148\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.160\nthat and it's gonna show me, well there's\nmore than one city called London.\n\n149\n00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.120\nLet's go with London,\nOhio that can't be too big of a city.\n\n150\n00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.460\nAnd we can click on that and\nI can see that in London,\n\n151\n00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.000\nOhio which apparently is a big city cuz we\ngot five different Vue centers in there\n\n152\n00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.740\nthat you can go and take that exam.\n\n153\n00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.550\nSo you pick your center, sign up for\nthe exam, pay your money and\n\n154\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.400\nthen go and pass it and\nget your certification.\n\n155\n00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.940\nWell, if all that sounds\nexciting to you and\n\n156\n00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.680\nyou're ready to jump in and start\nlearning about cloud technologies and\n\n157\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.080\nin the Cloud+ in general,\nyou're in the right place.\n\n158\n00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.220\nStay tuned,\nwe've got episodes coming up next.\n\n159\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.080\nIf you're not quite ready, if you don't\nmeet those minimum
