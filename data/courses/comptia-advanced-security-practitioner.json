Practitioner\n\n3\n00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.090\nor CASP.\n\n4\n00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.516\nAnd with me to go through all this\ninformation and get us ready for\n\n5\n00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.000\nthe exam is none other than Mr.\nSean Oriyano.\n\n6\n00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.800\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n7\n00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.710\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n8\n00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.380\nHow you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.420\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.360\nSo tell me Sean, we got the CompTIA\nAdvanced Security Practitioner.\n\n11\n00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.420\nWho is the intended audience for\nthis exam?\n\n12\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.500\n>> Well the intended audience, if you\nlisten to CompTIA it's kind of vague on\n\n13\n00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.070\nit so that's something that\nwe do have to clear up.\n\n14\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.340\nCompTIA kind of explains it as\nadvanced security professionals and\n\n15\n00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.760\nokay, that sounds good, but\nwe kinda gotta fill in those gaps.\n\n16\n00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.810\nIt is correct to say it's\nadvanced security professionals,\n\n17\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.420\nbut it's still kinda fuzzy\nto leave it like that.\n\n18\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.900\nYes, this is more advanced\nthan their other offerings.\n\n19\n00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.750\nSecurity+, which would\ndefinitely be more of a beginner\n\n20\n00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.630\nlevel credentials to get into security.\n\n21\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.200\nThis just goes a little further and\na little broader than that.\n\n22\n00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.100\nAnd so when you talk about advanced\nsecurity professionals, it's someone\n\n23\n00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.760\nthat's been in the field like three, four\nyears, I'd say, is probably pretty fair.\n\n24\n00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.180\nSomeone that has actively been working on\nit since the earned their Security+ or\n\n25\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.120\nhave had that level of knowledge.\n\n26\n00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.230\nIt's those type of people.\n\n27\n00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.940\nI would even say maybe job types\nyou're talking maybe managers.\n\n28\n00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.900\nThat would be a good fit for this.\n\n29\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.240\nIt wouldn't be where the CISP is though,\nthat's an important thing.\n\n30\n00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.500\nPeople do have that issue,\noh it's like the CISP.\n\n31\n00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.800\nNo it's not like the CISP,\nit's different than that.\n\n32\n00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.574\nIf you put them in perspective,\nyou've got Security+, then the CASP,\n\n33\n00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:51.170\nand then the CISP right up above that.\n\n34\n00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.530\nAnd there's some crossover between\nthe CASP and the CISP but not a ton.\n\n35\n00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.172\n>> Not a ton, okay, so\nthis is really good.\n\n36\n00:01:57.172 --> 00:02:00.730\nWhere Security+ or more for my people\nthat are implementing security or\n\n37\n00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.840\njust getting started in security.\n\n38\n00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.530\nThis seems to be more geared to those\npeople that are making those decisions or\n\n39\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.950\ndesigning those security plans for\nthe enterprise as a whole.\n\n40\n00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.660\n>> Yeah, that would be a very good\nplace to put this into context.\n\n41\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.760\nYeah, if you look at what the prior\noffering was, that was just to get you\n\n42\n00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.020\nacquainted with the technology and\nsome basics to get you moving around and\n\n43\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.050\nget you to be someone that is\nfunctional as far as security goes.\n\n44\n00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.290\nAnd have a basic understanding.\n\n45\n00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.450\nIt's not as simple as security awareness,\nbut\n\n46\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.400\nyou could say, it's security awareness for\nIT professionals.\n\n47\n00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.780\nIt's going to technical stuff then where\nthe normal rank and file wouldn't get it.\n\n48\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.550\nBut it's someone that is\ngoing to be managing.\n\n49\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.032\nNeeds to understand risk management,\nincident response, and\n\n50\n00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:55.760\nthe guys have the higher level look at how\nnetworks and different technologies work.\n\n51\n00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.040\nSo we're not getting into\nnecessarily legal stuff and\n\n52\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.550\neverything at this point, in software\ndevelopment stuff at this point.\n\n53\n00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.650\nBut we're starting to move further up\nthe scale to get a better understanding in\n\n54\n00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.570\nthis whole ecosystem and\nall things that go around it.\n\n55\n00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.200\n>> Yeah, sure did.\n\n56\n00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.900\nAnd I'm on their website now and I'll\nthrow the link for that in the show notes.\n\n57\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.800\nJust looking at the exam details,\nthey're saying that CAS-002 is out now,\n\n58\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.380\nand 80 questions maximum.\n\n59\n00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.970\nThat can vary.\n\n60\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.280\nMultiple choice and some performance\nbased questions are going to be on there.\n\n61\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.740\nYou have about 165 minutes for that exam,\nso they give you a good amount of time.\n\n62\n00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.430\nAnd pass or fail.\n\n63\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.060\nThere's no scaled score.\n\n64\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.650\nYou either pass it or you don't,\n\n65\n00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.082\nwhich always makes that last\nclick a little bit nervous.\n\n66\n00:03:38.082 --> 00:03:38.849\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n67\n00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.778\nthat's why you're here because we wanna\nget you the information you need so\n\n68\n00:03:41.778 --> 00:03:44.540\nyou don't have to be so nervous when\nyou click that finish on that exam.\n\n69\n00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.650\nAnd prereq-wise, on their website, Sean,\nthey don't say there's any prereqs but\n\n70\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.100\nthey do recommend, as you said,\nMaybe some Security+ at least,\n\n71\n00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.140\nor a few years of experience in the field.\n\n72\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.830\n>> Yeah, that would be fair.\n\n73\n00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.270\nJust jumping into this\nexam you could do it.\n\n74\n00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.719\nI mean it's entirely possible to do it.\n\n75\n00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.620\nBut one of the things\nI've said even here is\n\n76\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.500\nheck you can eat an ice cream\ncone from the bottom up.\n\n77\n00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.375\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's not really the best idea.\n\n78\n00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:15.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you could do this,\n\n79\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.080\nyou could jump right in with both feet and\ndo this, but\n\n80\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.600\nit's probably better for\nyou to have something equivalent to or\n\n81\n00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.520\nactually have the Security+ and have some\nexperience Before you jump into this\n\n82\n00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.055\nbecause it is kind of a jarring\ntransition between the two.\n\n83\n00:04:34.055 --> 00:04:36.770\nBut if you've gone Security+ and\nthen you get up to this,\n\n84\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.500\nyou'll notice that all of a sudden you're\nbeing exposed to a much broader and\n\n85\n00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.400\nmuch more stuff than you saw\nover on that side of the house.\n\n86\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.410\nSo you definitely wanna be working with us\nand definitely wanna have some experience.\n\n87\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.120\nNothing says you have to have a Security+,\nbut It would be recommended that you\n\n88\n00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.150\npossess at least that level of\nknowledge and then some experience.\n\n89\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.010\nJust even having the Security+ probably\nisn't going to give you too much\n\n90\n00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.080\nhelp on its own to even pass this.\n\n91\n00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.848\nYou kinda gotta have that\nexperience to understand and\n\n92\n00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:11.842\nput everything in the proper context.\n\n93\n00:05:11.842 --> 00:05:15.955\n>> All right, I hope everybody out there\nis excited as we are to dive into our\n\n94\n00:05:15.955 --> 00:05:18.462\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner.\n\n95\n00:05:18.462 --> 00:05:24.359\n[SOUND]\n\n",
