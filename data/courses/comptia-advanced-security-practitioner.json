Practitioner\n\n3\n00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.090\nor CASP.\n\n4\n00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.516\nAnd with me to go through all this\ninformation and get us ready for\n\n5\n00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.000\nthe exam is none other than Mr.\nSean Oriyano.\n\n6\n00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.800\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n7\n00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.710\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n8\n00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.380\nHow you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.420\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.360\nSo tell me Sean, we got the CompTIA\nAdvanced Security Practitioner.\n\n11\n00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.420\nWho is the intended audience for\nthis exam?\n\n12\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.500\n>> Well the intended audience, if you\nlisten to CompTIA it's kind of vague on\n\n13\n00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.070\nit so that's something that\nwe do have to clear up.\n\n14\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.340\nCompTIA kind of explains it as\nadvanced security professionals and\n\n15\n00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.760\nokay, that sounds good, but\nwe kinda gotta fill in those gaps.\n\n16\n00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.810\nIt is correct to say it's\nadvanced security professionals,\n\n17\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.420\nbut it's still kinda fuzzy\nto leave it like that.\n\n18\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.900\nYes, this is more advanced\nthan their other offerings.\n\n19\n00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.750\nSecurity+, which would\ndefinitely be more of a beginner\n\n20\n00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.630\nlevel credentials to get into security.\n\n21\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.200\nThis just goes a little further and\na little broader than that.\n\n22\n00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.100\nAnd so when you talk about advanced\nsecurity professionals, it's someone\n\n23\n00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.760\nthat's been in the field like three, four\nyears, I'd say, is probably pretty fair.\n\n24\n00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.180\nSomeone that has actively been working on\nit since the earned their Security+ or\n\n25\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.120\nhave had that level of knowledge.\n\n26\n00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.230\nIt's those type of people.\n\n27\n00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.940\nI would even say maybe job types\nyou're talking maybe managers.\n\n28\n00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.900\nThat would be a good fit for this.\n\n29\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.240\nIt wouldn't be where the CISP is though,\nthat's an important thing.\n\n30\n00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.500\nPeople do have that issue,\noh it's like the CISP.\n\n31\n00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.800\nNo it's not like the CISP,\nit's different than that.\n\n32\n00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.574\nIf you put them in perspective,\nyou've got Security+, then the CASP,\n\n33\n00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:51.170\nand then the CISP right up above that.\n\n34\n00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.530\nAnd there's some crossover between\nthe CASP and the CISP but not a ton.\n\n35\n00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.172\n>> Not a ton, okay, so\nthis is really good.\n\n36\n00:01:57.172 --> 00:02:00.730\nWhere Security+ or more for my people\nthat are implementing security or\n\n37\n00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.840\njust getting started in security.\n\n38\n00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.530\nThis seems to be more geared to those\npeople that are making those decisions or\n\n39\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.950\ndesigning those security plans for\nthe enterprise as a whole.\n\n40\n00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.660\n>> Yeah, that would be a very good\nplace to put this into context.\n\n41\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.760\nYeah, if you look at what the prior\noffering was, that was just to get you\n\n42\n00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.020\nacquainted with the technology and\nsome basics to get you moving around and\n\n43\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.050\nget you to be someone that is\nfunctional as far as security goes.\n\n44\n00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.290\nAnd have a basic understanding.\n\n45\n00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.450\nIt's not as simple as security awareness,\nbut\n\n46\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.400\nyou could say, it's security awareness for\nIT professionals.\n\n47\n00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.780\nIt's going to technical stuff then where\nthe normal rank and file wouldn't get it.\n\n48\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.550\nBut it's someone that is\ngoing to be managing.\n\n49\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.032\nNeeds to understand risk management,\nincident response, and\n\n50\n00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:55.760\nthe guys have the higher level look at how\nnetworks and different technologies work.\n\n51\n00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.040\nSo we're not getting into\nnecessarily legal stuff and\n\n52\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.550\neverything at this point, in software\ndevelopment stuff at this point.\n\n53\n00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.650\nBut we're starting to move further up\nthe scale to get a better understanding in\n\n54\n00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.570\nthis whole ecosystem and\nall things that go around it.\n\n55\n00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.200\n>> Yeah, sure did.\n\n56\n00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.900\nAnd I'm on their website now and I'll\nthrow the link for that in the show notes.\n\n57\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.800\nJust looking at the exam details,\nthey're saying that CAS-002 is out now,\n\n58\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.380\nand 80 questions maximum.\n\n59\n00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.970\nThat can vary.\n\n60\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.280\nMultiple choice and some performance\nbased questions are going to be on there.\n\n61\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.740\nYou have about 165 minutes for that exam,\nso they give you a good amount of time.\n\n62\n00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.430\nAnd pass or fail.\n\n63\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.060\nThere's no scaled score.\n\n64\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.650\nYou either pass it or you don't,\n\n65\n00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.082\nwhich always makes that last\nclick a little bit nervous.\n\n66\n00:03:38.082 --> 00:03:38.849\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n67\n00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.778\nthat's why you're here because we wanna\nget you the information you need so\n\n68\n00:03:41.778 --> 00:03:44.540\nyou don't have to be so nervous when\nyou click that finish on that exam.\n\n69\n00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.650\nAnd prereq-wise, on their website, Sean,\nthey don't say there's any prereqs but\n\n70\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.100\nthey do recommend, as you said,\nMaybe some Security+ at least,\n\n71\n00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.140\nor a few years of experience in the field.\n\n72\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.830\n>> Yeah, that would be fair.\n\n73\n00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.270\nJust jumping into this\nexam you could do it.\n\n74\n00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.719\nI mean it's entirely possible to do it.\n\n75\n00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.620\nBut one of the things\nI've said even here is\n\n76\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.500\nheck you can eat an ice cream\ncone from the bottom up.\n\n77\n00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.375\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's not really the best idea.\n\n78\n00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:15.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you could do this,\n\n79\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.080\nyou could jump right in with both feet and\ndo this, but\n\n80\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.600\nit's probably better for\nyou to have something equivalent to or\n\n81\n00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.520\nactually have the Security+ and have some\nexperience Before you jump into this\n\n82\n00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.055\nbecause it is kind of a jarring\ntransition between the two.\n\n83\n00:04:34.055 --> 00:04:36.770\nBut if you've gone Security+ and\nthen you get up to this,\n\n84\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.500\nyou'll notice that all of a sudden you're\nbeing exposed to a much broader and\n\n85\n00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.400\nmuch more stuff than you saw\nover on that side of the house.\n\n86\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.410\nSo you definitely wanna be working with us\nand definitely wanna have some experience.\n\n87\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.120\nNothing says you have to have a Security+,\nbut It would be recommended that you\n\n88\n00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.150\npossess at least that level of\nknowledge and then some experience.\n\n89\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.010\nJust even having the Security+ probably\nisn't going to give you too much\n\n90\n00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.080\nhelp on its own to even pass this.\n\n91\n00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.848\nYou kinda gotta have that\nexperience to understand and\n\n92\n00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:11.842\nput everything in the proper context.\n\n93\n00:05:11.842 --> 00:05:15.955\n>> All right, I hope everybody out there\nis excited as we are to dive into our\n\n94\n00:05:15.955 --> 00:05:18.462\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner.\n\n95\n00:05:18.462 --> 00:05:24.359\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.396\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith my today is Mr. Shawn Oriano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:17.525\nHow you doing Shawn?\n\n5\n00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:19.115\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:20.345\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:25.682\nWe are continuing on in our CASP or our\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner.\n\n8\n00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:26.859\nAnd in this episode Shawn,\n\n9\n00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.185\nI think we're just gonna start off\njust talking about some of the basics.\n\n10\n00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:34.840\nBuilding up our foundational knowledge,\ntalking about the cryptography, and\n\n11\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.055\nthe history of cryptography, and\nreally why do we use cryptography, right?\n\n12\n00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:43.860\n>> Yeah, that's really what we\ngotta focus on to get started.\n\n13\n00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.558\nIs we have to understand cryptography is,\nand why we use it, and\n\n14\n00:00:48.558 --> 00:00:52.213\nhow it fits into the context\nof CompTIA as an exam.\n\n15\n00:00:52.213 --> 00:00:56.920\nWhat you're gonna find out here, and\nthis is actually one of those areas.\n\n16\n00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.571\nIf you go back and\njust watch our intro or whatever on it,\n\n17\n00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:03.922\nsaying that it's different\nthan the Security+.\n\n18\n00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:06.545\nSecurity+, what they have a little tiny-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:07.079\n>> Thing out.\n\n20\n00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.076\nIt's like oh, cryptography and\nyeah, there you go.\n\n21\n00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:11.590\nIt's gone, you're onto the next thing.\n\n22\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.110\nThis is one of those areas that\nis dramatically different.\n\n23\n00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.870\nThere's a whole section of the body of\nknowledge that deals with cryptography.\n\n24\n00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.960\nSo they treat it pretty darn seriously\nin the context of this exam.\n\n25\n00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.304\nSo you've really gotta\nhave a good handle on it,\n\n26\n00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:32.708\nhave a good understanding of what's\ngoing on with this field and\n\n27\n00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:36.805\njust all these little things\nthat are happening within it.\n\n28\n00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:41.271\n>> Cryptography is a huge part of securing\nour data and securing our networks and\n\n29\n00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:45.459\nthere's a tons of choices when it comes\nto what algorithms we wanna use or\n\n30\n00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.775\npicking a program and\nit might decide what algorithm is.\n\n31\n00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.015\nSo that might make a different\non what we choose.\n\n32\n00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:55.525\nWhat underlying algorithm it uses or the\nmethods that it uses to encrypt that data,\n\n33\n00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:57.110\nthe security around it.\n\n34\n00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.930\nSo it's an important part\nof what we have to do.\n\n35\n00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.612\nSo of course,\nit's a big focus on the CASP.\n\n36\n00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:06.592\nAnd it really makes it easier, I think if\nwe understand where we came from to kinda\n\n37\n00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:09.600\nsee where we're at and\nwhere we're going, right?\n\n38\n00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.810\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n39\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.030\nIt's good to have an understanding\nof kinda the history and\n\n40\n00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.300\nthe background of it.\n\n41\n00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.030\nAnd cuz that kinda tells\nus where we're headed and\n\n42\n00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.680\nsets a good foundation for things.\n\n43\n00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.324\nNow, we're not gonna give you the full-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:02:25.324 --> 00:02:28.587\n>> Ad nauseum description of cryptography.\n\n45\n00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:30.004\n>> In 1214 AD.\n\n46\n00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:31.305\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n47\n00:02:31.305 --> 00:02:34.379\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll give you a second,\n\n48\n00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.852\nwe'll give you second\nto get your notebooks.\n\n49\n00:02:35.852 --> 00:02:41.790\n>> Yeah, we won't go into\nthat level of knowledge here.\n\n50\n00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.610\nThat's not necessary but\nit is necessary to understand that\n\n51\n00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.650\ncryptography does have a pretty long and\nstoried background.\n\n52\n00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.260\nPretty much ever since you've\nhad any reason to communicate\n\n53\n00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.060\nthere's been a reason to keep secrets, and\n\n54\n00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.280\nso when that came into play\ncryptography was right there.\n\n55\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.370\nSo we've been communicating for\na long time, had cryptography for\n\n56\n00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.380\na long time but we've started\ndocumenting instances of cryptography,\n\n57\n00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.390\na little over a couple thousand years ago.\n\n58\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.190\nWe can look back there it was actually\nbeing used at that point in time.\n\n59\n00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.661\nAnd it's advanced quite a bit since then,\nand\n\n60\n00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:26.556\nalong the way they always cite\nthings like you'll always see just\n\n61\n00:03:26.556 --> 00:03:31.629\nabout every book out there on\ncryptography it'll talk about things\n\n62\n00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.352\nlike Citily with wrapping a leather\nstrap around a wooden rod.\n\n63\n00:03:36.352 --> 00:03:37.559\nThat's what my dad used to beat me with.\n\n64\n00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:43.108\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, but it's there was that one.\n\n65\n00:03:43.108 --> 00:03:47.903\nThere was the Caesar cipher,\nsimple substitution\n\n66\n00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:52.710\ncipher that's been around for\na long, long time.\n\n67\n00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.230\nIt's still actually used today.\n\n68\n00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.350\nSo those are just a couple examples\nfrom a couple thousand years ago,\n\n69\n00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.970\nand it's evolved dramatically since then.\n\n70\n00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.890\nWe've got all sorts of nice\ndigital methods of enhancing\n\n71\n00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.390\nthe power of cryptography which\nhas really, really strengthen it.\n\n72\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.573\nBut it's also made it easier\nto break the stuff too.\n\n73\n00:04:15.573 --> 00:04:19.400\nSo it's a constant battle going on.\n\n74\n00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.430\nAnd that's been true along\nthe whole path of cryptography\n\n75\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.120\nas things have moved along through time.\n\n76\n00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.020\nSomething that looked good, someone\nelse figured out a way to break it and\n\n77\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.705\nthen they had to up\ntheir game on one side,\n\n78\n00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:34.100\nsome the other side had to\nup their game over there.\n\n79\n00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.765\nSo it's cat and\nmouse type thing that's going on.\n\n80\n00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:41.480\nAnd some of the stuff\nyou've seen at one point,\n\n81\n00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.490\nthat stuff that you look at now\nis being oh, well that's nothing.\n\n82\n00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.240\nAt some point, that was state of the art.\n\n83\n00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.150\nCaesar cipher at one point\nwas state of the art.\n\n84\n00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.640\nThe Vigenere cipher that we talked about\nextensively in the cryptography course\n\n85\n00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.580\nwe did, that was actually considered state\nof the art for a couple hundred years.\n\n86\n00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.586\nAnd o and behold, running tired in the US\nCivil War, it was starting to be broken\n\n87\n00:05:04.586 --> 00:05:09.766\nfairly routinely, it took some effort but\nthey were actually able to break that.\n\n88\n00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:15.875\nSo it's a good example of the way\ncryptography has worked along the way.\n\n89\n00:05:15.875 --> 00:05:20.105\nNowadays yeah, it's still the same\ntype of deal but just digital.\n\n90\n00:05:20.105 --> 00:05:23.353\n>> Just try to stay ahead of the game and\nas we figure out new ways to keep that\n\n91\n00:05:23.353 --> 00:05:26.345\ndata safe, there's always bad\nguys that wanna get access to it.\n\n92\n00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:27.969\nAnd they've got the resources and\n\n93\n00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.665\nthe time to work on the techniques\nyou used to encrypt it.\n\n94\n00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:33.340\nThey're gonna break it eventually\ngiven enough time, right?\n\n95\n00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.270\nBut in the meantime we're\nnot sitting on our laurels\n\n96\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.750\non the security side of things.\n\n97\n00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.464\nWe're trying to make our stuff better and\nstronger and\n\n98\n00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:43.110\nkeep the whole cat as you said,\nthe cat and mouse cycle going.\n\n99\n00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.418\n>> Yeah, that's absolutely the case.\n\n100\n00:05:45.418 --> 00:05:48.520\nNo one's kinda sitting back on\neither side and saying okay,\n\n101\n00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.050\nwell that's the way we're gonna leave it.\n\n102\n00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.110\nThey are always developing new types of\nalgorithms and new systems and new ways to\n\n103\n00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.420\nexchange keys and create stronger keys,\nand just all sort of fascinating stuff.\n\n104\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.673\nSo we've gone from things that are way,\n\n105\n00:06:03.673 --> 00:06:06.207\nway back to people\nchiseling stuff on a rock.\n\n106\n00:06:06.207 --> 00:06:09.053\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And doing cave paintings to,\n\n107\n00:06:09.053 --> 00:06:14.262\nif you watched our cryptography course,\nyou saw that at the end of it,\n\n108\n00:06:14.262 --> 00:06:18.980\nwe were talking about quantum physics and\nstuff like that.\n\n109\n00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.820\nAnd that's where they are moving now.\n\n110\n00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.720\nSo it's a tremendous span of science and\ntechnology that\n\n111\n00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.070\nthey've gone through to keep this\nwhole ball rolling and make it so\n\n112\n00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:36.270\nthey really can conceal information and\nkeep it out of the way of prying eyes.\n\n113\n00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.265\nIt's a fascinating subject to get into.\n\n114\n00:06:41.265 --> 00:06:44.038\n>> Just looking at the history of it,\nit's pretty cool and\n\n115\n00:06:44.038 --> 00:06:47.410\nyou can see the progression as\nthe technology has changed.\n\n116\n00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.610\nI know a lot of people that think of\ncryptography, they think of computers and\n\n117\n00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.845\nthey think before we had computers,\nthere was no cryptography.\n\n118\n00:06:53.845 --> 00:06:57.260\nWell definitely not the case.\n\n119\n00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.080\n>> It's actually you mention that because\nthat's the same thing I encounter too,\n\n120\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.119\nis that there's that\n\n121\n00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.330\nway people think in their heads those\ntwo are just married to one another.\n\n122\n00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.960\nYou can't have one without the other and\nthat's definitely not the case.\n\n123\n00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.106\nAll you're doing is\nyou're finding a way or\n\n124\n00:07:17.106 --> 00:07:22.243\nhaving a repeatable consistent reliable\nmethod switching something from\n\n125\n00:07:22.243 --> 00:07:27.147\none format to another it has to be\nrepeatable, it has to be consistent.\n\n126\n00:07:27.147 --> 00:07:30.944\nIt has to be something that someone\nelse can do and it's workable.\n\n127\n00:07:30.944 --> 00:07:37.940\nSo any system that has existed\nthrough time has had those properties.\n\n128\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.625\nBut when I say that it has\nto have those properties,\n\n129\n00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:46.692\nnone of those properties say that\na computer is required by any means.\n\n130\n00:07:46.692 --> 00:07:51.213\nAnd some of the strongest\nsystems in history have\n\n131\n00:07:51.213 --> 00:07:56.409\nrequired zero computer\nknowledge whatsoever to work.\n\n132\n00:07:56.409 --> 00:08:00.008\nAnd that's incredibly fascinating when-\n>> Yeah.\n\n133\n00:08:00.008 --> 00:08:00.728\n>> You look at it.\n\n134\n00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:04.385\nLook at World War two and\nthe enigma machine.\n\n135\n00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:10.919\nThat's really, really, simple technology,\nas far as how it was built but,\n\n136\n00:08:10.919 --> 00:08:15.810\nthat was an immensely strong\ncryptographic system.\n\n137\n00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.140\nAnd so it just shows that you\ndon't need a super computer or\n\n138\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.080\nsomething like that to\nbuild a good crypto system.\n\n139\n00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.420\nIn fact,\nI always think of the one that they had,\n\n140\n00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.720\nthe French had a system, I think it was\nthe French, called the Great Cipher.\n\n141\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.790\nThey created this whole system for\nit and encoded documents to put\n\n142\n00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.646\nin their archives,\ncertain documents that were sensitive.\n\n143\n00:08:38.646 --> 00:08:43.060\nAnd that was way before the advent\nof anything that we know as\n\n144\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.120\ncomputers nowadays.\n\n145\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.590\nAnd it worked tremendously effectively.\n\n146\n00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.420\nThe reason why I remember that one is that\nthey lost knowledge of how it works so\n\n147\n00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.140\nthey've still got a bunch of stuff\nin their libraries going, yeah,\n\n148\n00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.611\nwe have to figure out how to\nbreak those one of these days.\n\n149\n00:08:56.611 --> 00:08:57.322\n[LAUGH]\n>> It might\n\n150\n00:08:57.322 --> 00:08:59.503\nhave worked actually a little too well for\nthem, in this case.\n\n151\n00:08:59.503 --> 00:09:02.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, it is fascinating to see that\n\n152\n00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.310\nyou know what, you don't need\ncomputers to do cryptography.\n\n153\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.720\nThey do make it easier and they make\nus use more powerful algorithms or\n\n154\n00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.820\nthey allow us, they give us the ability\nto use those more powerful algorithms.\n\n155\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.920\nThe other thing I always found\nfascinating is that we still see\n\n156\n00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.310\nsome of those techniques that we\ntalk about from way back when,\n\n157\n00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.680\nwhen we were, as you say,\nusing stone and chisel.\n\n158\n00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.860\nThe Ceaser Cipher and Vigenere.\n\n159\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.126\nWe still see those in\nmodern algorithms today.\n\n160\n00:09:26.126 --> 00:09:30.151\nYou'll see where this algorithm\nuses five rounds of substitution.\n\n161\n00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:33.040\nThat's really what they're\ndoing in the background, right?\n\n162\n00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.530\nSome of these older techniques.\n\n163\n00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.804\n>> Yeah, that's definitely the case.\n\n164\n00:09:36.804 --> 00:09:39.789\nNothing really truly goes away.\n\n165\n00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:47.000\nI've heard the same thing in\nthe science field, that, in general,\n\n166\n00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.360\nwhen you have a theory\nthat's put forth and\n\n167\n00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.600\nit's disproved later on through\nexperimentation and all that.\n\n168\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.830\nThat theory never really 100% goes away.\n\n169\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.810\nBecause somebody's experimented on it,\nlearned that,\n\n170\n00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.630\nthat isn't actually the way\nit was supposed to be.\n\n171\n00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:10.890\nSo, they just work on that theory and uses\nas a spring board to create the new one.\n\n172\n00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.880\nAnd parts of the old one will be carried\nright on through into the new one.\n\n173\n00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.160\nAnd so you never truly have a theory\nthat just, poof, and disappears.\n\n174\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.770\nWell, in most cases,\nit just doesn't poof and disappear.\n\n175\n00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.228\nAnd that happened with things like\nthe Big Bang theory and stuff like that,\n\n176\n00:10:27.228 --> 00:10:31.870\nthey had all these different theories\nthat were being sprung around.\n\n177\n00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:36.155\nAnd that's before, I think of the Big Bang\ntheory cuz the Big Bang theory.\n\n178\n00:10:36.155 --> 00:10:41.515\nOne of the theories put forth before\nwhat we know the Big Bang theory today,\n\n179\n00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:46.896\nactually said that the universe was\nfilled with ether and stuff like that.\n\n180\n00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.040\nAnd it was a steady state and\ndidn't change and all that.\n\n181\n00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.310\nAnd then someone said later on,\nno, everything was at one point,\n\n182\n00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.780\nand exploded and created the universe.\n\n183\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.620\nSo there's not this mysterious\nsubstance called ether out there.\n\n184\n00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.650\nWell, that theory kind of went away but\nnow it's come back because they're saying,\n\n185\n00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.410\noh, well,\nthe Big Bang theory of exploding was true.\n\n186\n00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:11.700\nBut this ether,\nif we changed the term to dark matter,\n\n187\n00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.350\nnow all of a sudden,\nthere is something to that.\n\n188\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.635\nWhy the whole theory\ndoesn't hold true anymore.\n\n189\n00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:21.424\nThat idea of space being filled\nwith something called ether.\n\n190\n00:11:21.424 --> 00:11:23.620\nCould be that dark matter\nthat we're talking about.\n\n191\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.200\nSo, same thing with cryptography.\n\n192\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.652\nCryptography, when you look at it,\nlike you said,\n\n193\n00:11:28.652 --> 00:11:32.610\nthese little pieces that were used\nbefore may have been used on their own.\n\n194\n00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.640\nYou can merge all these\npieces together like little,\n\n195\n00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.050\nI always think of Legos and\nsnap them together to build something.\n\n196\n00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.120\nThat's what it is,\nthey may be or may have been\n\n197\n00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.160\npretty substantial on their own at\nsome point but, when you combine them,\n\n198\n00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.660\nyou get something that's much\ngreater than the sum of it's parts.\n\n199\n00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.290\nAnd so something that may be completely\nweak and horrible on it's own,\n\n200\n00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.250\nby today's standards, when you combine it\nwith all these other things, it's much,\n\n201\n00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:06.840\nmuch stronger and so it's a very,\nvery, very big deal.\n\n202\n00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.420\nAnd if you look at the stuff\nthey've had for code break and\n\n203\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.720\ncryptanalysis, as those\ntechniques have evolved.\n\n204\n00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.030\nIt's really impacted stuff on the other\nside in the creation of these things.\n\n205\n00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:21.340\nIn fact, computing power, as it keeps\ngetting bumped up more and more and more.\n\n206\n00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.000\nIt keeps making guys at\nplaces like the NSA and\n\n207\n00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.370\nother places like that, that create\nthese things and work with them.\n\n208\n00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:32.680\nThey have to keep a very, very close\neye on how these things develop because\n\n209\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.850\nevery generation, every little\nadvance in technology means that\n\n210\n00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.820\ntheir algorithms have to be\nadjusted to account for that.\n\n211\n00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.630\nSo that's something that you necessarily\ndidn't need to know before, but\n\n212\n00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.587\nyou do need to know now.\n\n213\n00:12:47.587 --> 00:12:53.800\n>> All right, so Sean, we've got an idea\nof cryptography as a general and\n\n214\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.760\nwhen I think of cryptography, I think of\nencrypting text so that nobody can see it.\n\n215\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.110\nBut there's actually several\ndifferent reasons or goals,\n\n216\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.130\nI guess you could say,\nof cryptography, right?\n\n217\n00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.290\n>> Yeah, cryptography,\nwhen most people think of cryptography,\n\n218\n00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.500\nthey think of just one thing, and\n\n219\n00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.870\nthat's just scrambling something in\nsuch a way that no one else can read it.\n\n220\n00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.330\nAnd then you're the one that has\nthe key that can unlock it and\n\n221\n00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.630\nopen it up and read the secret.\n\n222\n00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:21.170\nThat's the common thing that people think\nabout it, but it's not the only thing.\n\n223\n00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:26.960\nThat's a correct statement to say\na cryptography does cover that area but\n\n224\n00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.990\nit's not the only area it covers.\n\n225\n00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:36.330\nWe actually have four areas that it does\nimpact quite dramatically, depending on\n\n226\n00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:42.060\nhow you use the technology that we will\nbe talking about later on down the line.\n\n227\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.350\nSo, yes we do have confidentiality,\n\n228\n00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:48.570\nwhich would be concealing information\nto keep it from being disclosed\n\n229\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.710\nto parties that we just plain simply don't\nwant them to have it for whatever reason.\n\n230\n00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.780\nWe just don't want them to have it.\n\n231\n00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.650\nSo there's that, but\nthen we move through to the other areas.\n\n232\n00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.230\nSo we still have three more left.\n\n233\n00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.277\nWe have the integrity aspect of it.\n\n234\n00:14:03.277 --> 00:14:08.500\nThe integrity aspect means that we need\nto make sure that data isn't altered.\n\n235\n00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.630\nInformation that we put out there\nis still going to remain the same,\n\n236\n00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.020\nor be verified that that's the format or\n\n237\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.880\nit's the form that we intended when we\nput it out there in the first place.\n\n238\n00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.670\nYou don't wanna be putting information out\nthere, and have any doubt that it's not\n\n239\n00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:30.360\ntrue and correct to the intention that you\nhad when you originally put it out there,\n\n240\n00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.200\ncuz then how can someone\ntrust that information?\n\n241\n00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.260\nSo we can't have that,\nand remember, by the way,\n\n242\n00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:43.720\neach one of these areas we're talking\nabout, they're not mutually exclusive.\n\n243\n00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.860\nYou can use them together.\n\n244\n00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.535\nBut, it doesn't mean\nthat if you're using one,\n\n245\n00:14:48.535 --> 00:14:51.250\nit automatically gives you\nthe benefits of the other.\n\n246\n00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.690\nSo, we're talking about\nconfidentiality and integrity,\n\n247\n00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:59.510\nthose are just two parts of it that\ncryptography as a whole can cover.\n\n248\n00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.720\nBut you can do\nthe confidentiality part and\n\n249\n00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.720\nthe integrity part entirely on its own,\nand never have to touch the others.\n\n250\n00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.750\nSo when I do integrity, nothing in any\nof the statement I made said that,\n\n251\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:14.000\nthat information isn't readable by anybody\nelse out there that wants to look at it.\n\n252\n00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.750\nSo that's very important.\n\n253\n00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.569\nSome people kinda get those\nmixed up in their heads.\n\n254\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.720\nMake sure you don't do that.\n\n255\n00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.320\nWe really don't wanna do that.\n\n256\n00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.785\n>> Later on when we're picking\nan algorithm or program or\n\n257\n00:15:25.785 --> 00:15:27.090\nprotocol that we wanna use.\n\n258\n00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.360\nWe gotta decide,\nwhat is it do I need to provide?\n\n259\n00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.410\nDo I need to provide confidentiality?\n\n260\n00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.450\nDo I need to provide integrity or both?\n\n261\n00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.588\nCuz I can find things that do one or\nthe other or both.\n\n262\n00:15:36.588 --> 00:15:40.300\n>> Yes, it is an important thing to be\nthinking through in your head when you're\n\n263\n00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:46.640\ndesigning the system and considering what\ntypes of things you need to provide.\n\n264\n00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.530\nAnd that's actually\ntalks to a bigger issue.\n\n265\n00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:54.424\nWhy do we have to, in something like\nthis body of knowledge for the CASP,\n\n266\n00:15:54.424 --> 00:15:58.453\nhave to talk about cryptography so\nin depth.\n\n267\n00:15:58.453 --> 00:16:03.220\nWell, you're a manager now, you're\nspeccing out, you're speccing out systems.\n\n268\n00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.170\nYou're gonna be getting into\nhelping design secure systems and\n\n269\n00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.910\ntaking things into consideration.\n\n270\n00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:13.100\nWell cryptography is basically all over\nthe place in the area of security.\n\n271\n00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.740\nThere's very few areas\nwhere it doesn't touch.\n\n272\n00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.529\nAnd so you have to have\nan intimate knowledge of it.\n\n273\n00:16:18.529 --> 00:16:22.491\nSo you know first of all what you need to\nprovide as far as keeping stuff secret or\n\n274\n00:16:22.491 --> 00:16:24.113\nmaintaining the integrity of or\n\n275\n00:16:24.113 --> 00:16:27.230\ndoing these other things\nwe are going to talk about.\n\n276\n00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:31.630\nOnce you've got those things in\nyour mind that you need to provide,\n\n277\n00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.820\nthen you can put the proper\ncryptographic solution in place.\n\n278\n00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.730\nBut if you don't have that, and\nyou don't consider those things first.\n\n279\n00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.350\nOr you considered those things but\n\n280\n00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.950\ndon't know the cryptography all that well\nyou are just not going to do it right.\n\n281\n00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:44.805\nYou just won't.\n\n282\n00:16:44.805 --> 00:16:50.560\nThere's been plenty of situations\nwhere an otherwise good\n\n283\n00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.970\ncryptographic system has looked horrible\nbecause someone used it incorrectly.\n\n284\n00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.680\nYou just don't want to have that.\n\n285\n00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.250\nSo many applications you've seen of\ncryptography would be the equivalent\n\n286\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:08.015\nof someone trying to pound in a nail\nusing a hammer or using a wrench.\n\n287\n00:17:08.015 --> 00:17:09.080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When you have the both,\n\n288\n00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.400\nyou can hammer in with both, but one's\ngoing to be a lot better to do that job.\n\n289\n00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.502\nYou know, so, it's just knowing,\nyou know, what your weapons are,\n\n290\n00:17:18.502 --> 00:17:23.706\nwhat things you have in your reach are and\napplying them appropriately.\n\n291\n00:17:23.706 --> 00:17:25.549\n>> As we were talking about, you know,\n\n292\n00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:29.240\nyou said in the beginning that there\nare four main goals of cryptography.\n\n293\n00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.370\nWe talked about confidentiality and\nintegrity.\n\n294\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.120\nNow these next two, Shawn, sometimes,\nI get these guys a little mixed up,\n\n295\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.880\nso help us out with it.\n\n296\n00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.930\nWe've got non-repudiation and\nauthentication.\n\n297\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.220\n>> Yes, these are a couple important\nareas that cryptography does play a huge\n\n298\n00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.415\nrole in.\n\n299\n00:17:47.415 --> 00:17:50.590\nNon-repudiation simply means that\n\n300\n00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:54.690\nif you look at it just that statement just\non its own and that term just on its own.\n\n301\n00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:01.240\nIt means that you have a way of verifying\nthat some entity, whoever it is.\n\n302\n00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.210\nIf we go back to kind of\nlike our sys terminology.\n\n303\n00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.590\nIf you've been through that sys uses\na term subject and object, you know,\n\n304\n00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.820\na subject accesses an object.\n\n305\n00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:16.250\nWell if you look at that type\nof interaction, it means you\n\n306\n00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:22.460\ncan definitively lock down who the subject\nis that interacted with a certain object.\n\n307\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.025\nSo whatever event took\nplace between those two.\n\n308\n00:18:26.025 --> 00:18:32.070\nThere's no question that this subject\ninitiated that action, and carried it out.\n\n309\n00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:39.170\nSo Cryptography plays a big role\nin that because how are you gonna,\n\n310\n00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.580\nfor example,\ncheck to see if an event log is correct,\n\n311\n00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.570\nor who actually carried\nout a certain action?\n\n312\n00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.915\nYou just can't have it written down there\nsaying, yeah, this person did this.\n\n313\n00:18:48.915 --> 00:18:51.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You definitively say that\n\n314\n00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.470\nthis person did it.\n\n315\n00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:56.030\nYou know, you need to be able to\ndefinitively say who sent an email.\n\n316\n00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.300\nWe have technologies like digital\nsignatures that do just that,\n\n317\n00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.000\nthat say it came from this person and\nno one else.\n\n318\n00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.110\nSo those are really, really crucial.\n\n319\n00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:12.080\nYou look at things like digital\nsigning of drivers in software.\n\n320\n00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.276\nThat's to make sure that it came from\nthat specific vendor and no one else.\n\n321\n00:19:16.276 --> 00:19:20.700\nSo that's what non-repudiation\nis talking about.\n\n322\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.200\nIs making sure that you can tie\nwhoever initiated an action,\n\n323\n00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.740\nyou can tie that action directly to them,\nand it's unambiguous and so.\n\n324\n00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.090\n>> RIght, so I can't deny that it was from\nme, or that I'm the one that created it.\n\n325\n00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.220\nOr that I'm the one that deleted it or\nwhat have you.\n\n326\n00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.448\n>> Oh you can deny it, it just ain't\ngonna hold water is what we're saying.\n\n327\n00:19:38.448 --> 00:19:39.636\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah.\n\n328\n00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:40.330\n>> I can try.\n[LAUGH]\n\n329\n00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.732\n>> Yeah, you can do it all you want.\n\n330\n00:19:42.732 --> 00:19:44.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n331\n00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:49.560\nthat's a critical area where\nit plays a big, big, big role.\n\n332\n00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.682\nSo, significant to have that.\n\n333\n00:19:51.682 --> 00:19:52.590\n>> All right.\n\n334\n00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.850\nAnd how does authentication\ntie in to all this.\n\n335\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:59.680\n>> Authentication is\njust a way of validating\n\n336\n00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.360\nwho or what someone is.\n\n337\n00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.310\nAnd we need to have\na way to be able to say,\n\n338\n00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:12.710\nokay with a good degree of certainty that\nthat subject, we'll just go ahead and\n\n339\n00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.540\nstick with that term, that that\nsubject is who they claim they are.\n\n340\n00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.795\nSo we can say this is\nan authentic request,\n\n341\n00:20:19.795 --> 00:20:22.500\nthat this is valid request\ncoming from that party.\n\n342\n00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.880\nWe need to have positive ID on them.\n\n343\n00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.180\nAnd so\nwe have tools to do that in cryptography.\n\n344\n00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:34.570\nFor example, the whole process of\nusing public key cryptography.\n\n345\n00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:40.870\nThat's providing you a very strong\nway of authenticating someone.\n\n346\n00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.770\nIf they have one of that key pair,\nand you can\n\n347\n00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:49.810\nvalidate what they did with the other key,\nwhich is exactly how that system works.\n\n348\n00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:54.045\nThen you have a way of\nvalidating their authenticity.\n\n349\n00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:58.550\nThat's a significant part of the process.\n\n350\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:02.860\nCryptography makes that possible to occur,\nand, like I said,\n\n351\n00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.680\nyou could combine all\nthese things together.\n\n352\n00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.020\nIf you go and look at this,\nthese things of confidentiality,\n\n353\n00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.150\nintegrity, non-repudiation and\nauthentication.\n\n354\n00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.490\nLook at those four areas.\n\n355\n00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.990\nJust think about something, and if you\naren't clear on it, we'll get to it.\n\n356\n00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.500\nBut digital signatures for example,\n\n357\n00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.060\ndigital signatures, you know they\ncover the integrity part of it, and\n\n358\n00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.560\nthey cover non-repudiation,\nand they cover authentication.\n\n359\n00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.170\nThey only thing they do not do,\nis they don't do the confidentiality part.\n\n360\n00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.080\nSo, they cover three out\nof four of those things.\n\n361\n00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.289\nThey're merging them together to say, ok\nwell I'm going to take these three things\n\n362\n00:21:35.289 --> 00:21:37.878\nand put them together to make\na solution called digital signature.\n\n363\n00:21:37.878 --> 00:21:42.523\nAnd then once I have that,\nnow I've got a very\n\n364\n00:21:42.523 --> 00:21:47.420\nstrong solution to provide\na number of things.\n\n365\n00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.520\n>> We don't necessarily have to.\n\n366\n00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.470\nIf we want to provide\nall of those factors,\n\n367\n00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.020\nwe don't necessarily have to come\nup with four different solutions.\n\n368\n00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.870\nWe can find something that\nmight provide multiple factors.\n\n369\n00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:02.260\n>> Yeah, absolutely, several things in\ncryptography do cover the technology\n\n370\n00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:06.390\nwe talk about and methodologies we\ntalk about do cover multiple areas.\n\n371\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.840\nSo it's not like they're confined and\nsaying oh it's in this bucket over here,\n\n372\n00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.470\nand it's gonna stay over there.\n\n373\n00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:16.120\nNo, it very well could be something\nthat has weight in another area.\n\n374\n00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.790\nIt could be a good solution.\n\n375\n00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.410\nSo you're always looking for that when\nyou're going through cryptography,\n\n376\n00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:25.200\nis understanding that things\ncan serve multiple functions.\n\n377\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.910\nAnd so is it worthwhile for you to use\nthose and leverage those capabilities?\n\n378\n00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:34.360\nThings like asymmetric systems,\nand public key systems.\n\n379\n00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:39.420\nThey perform multiple things\non this list of four.\n\n380\n00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.820\nThey do provide several of those.\n\n381\n00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.070\nSo you've all ready got\na good example there, and so\n\n382\n00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.050\nyou really gotta have a good understanding\nof what those areas it covers.\n\n383\n00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:52.260\nSo you can say, oh, yeah,\nI know a way to address this solution.\n\n384\n00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.010\nAnd set up the proper technologies for it.\n\n385\n00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.100\n>> Or you end up picking a solution that\nyou think provides everything you need,\n\n386\n00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.570\nand it leaves out\nthe confidentiality part.\n\n387\n00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.965\nAnd that could get you\nin a little trouble.\n\n388\n00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:06.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's happened numerous times.\n\n389\n00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.320\nThis is one of the reasons why\nwhen you go through security and\n\n390\n00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.800\nlook at some of these systems out there.\n\n391\n00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.610\nThat the smart companies that\ndevelop these things and\n\n392\n00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:23.380\nthe smart engineers, they can be\nreally brilliant at what they do,\n\n393\n00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:28.240\nbut there's a whole set of skills and\nknowledge that goes with being someone\n\n394\n00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.908\nthat can develop, analyze, and\nreally understand a cryptographic system.\n\n395\n00:23:32.908 --> 00:23:36.140\nNow you may not need to have those\npeople's level of knowledge where you're\n\n396\n00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.690\nwriting these big formulas out and\n\n397\n00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:42.560\nunderstand how the mathematics and\nall the boolean and all that stuff work.\n\n398\n00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.570\nYou don't need to understand all that,\nbut you do need to kind of understand\n\n399\n00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:52.860\nwhere and how things fit in, so you can\nmake sure you're using what's appropriate.\n\n400\n00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.780\nThere's been plenty of\ncases where companies,\n\n401\n00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.870\nindividuals, standards bodies\nhave not understood that fact and\n\n402\n00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.940\nput the wrong thing in place or\nimplemented incorrectly.\n\n403\n00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.166\nAnd it was something that was a joke.\n\n404\n00:24:07.166 --> 00:24:10.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All you have to do is think of\n\n405\n00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:13.795\nsomething like WebP, and\nyou kind of got the idea.\n\n406\n00:24:13.795 --> 00:24:18.900\nWebP was implemented with a reasonably\ngood algorithm, not the strongest,\n\n407\n00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.280\nbut it was a reasonably good algorithm.\n\n408\n00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.890\nAnd it was implemented by electronic\nengineers that had good intentions but\n\n409\n00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:29.360\ndidn't know exactly how to implement\nthat cryptography correctly.\n\n410\n00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.380\nSo they just kind of shoe horned it in and\nsaid yeah, we've accomplished something.\n\n411\n00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.470\nWe've got it all secured and everything.\n\n412\n00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.840\nAnd without bringing in someone\nto analyze that system and\n\n413\n00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.545\nknew how it worked correctly,\nit fell apart.\n\n414\n00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:44.607\nAnd now we have something that can be\nbroken like tissue paper nowadays.\n\n415\n00:24:44.607 --> 00:24:45.658\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> So yeah, that's,\n\n416\n00:24:45.658 --> 00:24:47.090\nthat's kind of a good example of it.\n\n417\n00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.146\n>> All right.\n\n418\n00:24:48.146 --> 00:24:50.555\nWell Sean, I tell you,\na lot of good information.\n\n419\n00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:54.360\nLooked at the history, a brief history\nof cryptography, just talking about.\n\n420\n00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.930\nAnd how, it's not something recent.\n\n421\n00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.680\nIt's not something that came\nout when computers came out.\n\n422\n00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.710\nIt's been around since, pretty much, since\nwe've had the ability to communicate.\n\n423\n00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.730\nWe've needed to keep that communication\nsecret from somebody else.\n\n424\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.890\nAnd we talked about the different\ngoals that cryptography\n\n425\n00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.060\ncan provide depending\non what method we use.\n\n426\n00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:18.200\nWe've got our confidentiality,\nour integrity, our non-repudiation,\n\n427\n00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.120\nand our authentication.\n\n428\n00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.571\nSo all good information that's going to\nhelp us progress through these series of\n\n429\n00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:27.640\nvideos that we're gonna do on our\nComp T advance security practitioner.\n\n430\n00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.580\nSo anything else we want to\nthrow in on this one Sean?\n\n431\n00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.620\n>> No, I think we staged pretty well for\nwhat's coming ahead,\n\n432\n00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.205\nso you know, hold onto your seats.\n\n433\n00:25:36.205 --> 00:25:38.570\n[LAUGHING]\n>> Get ready for the ride of your life.\n\n434\n00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.550\nAll right well, ladies and\ngentlemen thanks for tuning in.\n\n435\n00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.010\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n436\n00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:44.980\n>> And I'm Sean Ariano.\n\n437\n00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:45.661\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n438\n00:25:45.661 --> 00:25:51.630\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.450\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oreano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.490\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.400\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.170\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.720\nWe're continuing on in our cast series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.820\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at some of the terms that we need\n\n9\n00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.198\nto be familiar with as we\nprogress through these concepts.\n\n10\n00:00:29.198 --> 00:00:34.050\n>> Yeah, in review, we do have to\nunderstand some terminology before we\n\n11\n00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.610\nreally get to the main concepts,\nthe main body here, if you will.\n\n12\n00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.040\nThis is one of those areas where\nCompTIA and most vendors and\n\n13\n00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.340\nmost areas that you get into will\nreally kind of be a stickler on this.\n\n14\n00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.600\nThey'll really want you to\nunderstand what the terms are.\n\n15\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.450\nAnd when you go into it, sometimes you'll\nbe fortunate enough that they'll have some\n\n16\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.264\nplace where they define it right there\nin that document when they put it out.\n\n17\n00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:08.740\nThere are other times it'll be hey\nhere you go, you figure it out.\n\n18\n00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.022\nAnd it's kind of folks in\nthe technology will know the terms.\n\n19\n00:01:12.022 --> 00:01:15.459\nIf you don't know the terms yet,\nthen you need to stop reading this and\n\n20\n00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:16.810\ngo read that and come back.\n\n21\n00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.720\nSo, what we're going to\ndo is we are going to\n\n22\n00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.070\nmake sure that you are familiar\nwith the terms before we get in to\n\n23\n00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.770\nthe really the big discussion on what\nthey mean in every given context.\n\n24\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.930\n>> All right.\n\n25\n00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.410\nVery good so any place you want to start?\n\n26\n00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.740\n>> You know there's really no\nparticular place that you can,\n\n27\n00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.990\nyou have to start,\nI guess is the way to put it.\n\n28\n00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.030\nThere are some terms that\njust need to be covered, but\n\n29\n00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.320\nit's not that you have to specifically\ncover them in a certain order.\n\n30\n00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.750\nThere is kind of a logic to them to\nmake it easier, so I went through it and\n\n31\n00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.971\nkind of, just looked like I\npuked up some terms on here.\n\n32\n00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:59.678\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I look at it and I'm like, wow,\n\n33\n00:01:59.678 --> 00:02:02.317\nI wasn't thinking when I did that.\n\n34\n00:02:02.317 --> 00:02:04.952\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's the time difference get\n\n35\n00:02:04.952 --> 00:02:05.556\noff my case.\n\n36\n00:02:05.556 --> 00:02:06.484\n>> Yeah a little jet lag right.\n\n37\n00:02:06.484 --> 00:02:08.055\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n38\n00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.527\nSo, but we'll talk about these terms,\nwe have, for example, we have\n\n39\n00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:19.807\nalgorithms,, algorithms\nare terms that are used a lot.\n\n40\n00:02:19.807 --> 00:02:23.747\nYou will not get away from that term,\nwhen you talk about cryptography.\n\n41\n00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:27.340\nAlgorithms are just a very,\nvery intimate and important part of it.\n\n42\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.080\nYou know, so what an algorithm is,\nit's just really another way of saying\n\n43\n00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.090\nyou have a formula, or\nsome process that's defined,\n\n44\n00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.780\nstep by step saying how somethings gonna\nbe moved from one format to another.\n\n45\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.120\nSo we have plenty of different algorithms.\n\n46\n00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.541\nWe have, for example,\nsymmetric algorithms, asymmetric or\n\n47\n00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:48.350\npublic algorithms, hashing algorithms.\n\n48\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.100\nAnd then there's some other ones,\nI kind of wove it in there, now and\n\n49\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.030\nthen that kind of show up now and then.\n\n50\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.380\nBut we won't worry about those for\nright now.\n\n51\n00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.550\nBut an algorithm, just kinda look at it.\n\n52\n00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.760\nWe can easily take one of our historical\nexamples, I always take a certain\n\n53\n00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.960\nhistorical example to illustrate some\nof these points because it's just easy.\n\n54\n00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.940\nAnd the one I always use is I use\nthe Caesar cipher just because\n\n55\n00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.500\nyou can look at it and you can understand\nit, you can visualize in your head.\n\n56\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.330\nYou don't have to have me draw it out\nhere for you or anything you can get it.\n\n57\n00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.670\nYou know, if you recall, the Cesar cipher\nwould take just a regular message, and\n\n58\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.740\nthen would take any letter in there and\n\n59\n00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.460\njust shift it over three\nspaces to the right.\n\n60\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.270\nAnd that was, that's the algorithm, hey,\n\n61\n00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.650\njust shift it over,\nthree space to the right.\n\n62\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.430\nIn fact, we can really dumb that down and\nsay just take this and\n\n63\n00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.590\nshift it over some number of spaces,\nthat's you're algorithm.\n\n64\n00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.330\nThat's a very, very simple algorithm, but\n\n65\n00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.710\nit is an algorithm because it\ndescribes what's being done.\n\n66\n00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.940\nAnd we can take the ops\ninstead of that same.\n\n67\n00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.960\nTake what was given to us and\nthen reverse that by moving\n\n68\n00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.880\nit to the other way X number of spaces,\nwhatever it was in the first case.\n\n69\n00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.500\nSo one would be the encryption process and\none would be decryption process.\n\n70\n00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.620\nSo moving it to the right,\nwould be encryption or\n\n71\n00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.270\nmoving it from plain text to ciphertext\nand then the other way taking ciphertext\n\n72\n00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.470\nand decrypting it and\nmoving it back to plain text.\n\n73\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.210\nSo, simple as that.\n\n74\n00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.750\nNow algorithms unfortunately\ndo not all look that simple.\n\n75\n00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.880\nThey may appear so, but they're definitely\nnot, unless you're someone that's got\n\n76\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.861\na lot of brain power,\na lot of stuff going and that ain't me.\n\n77\n00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:41.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, if you are a math whiz or\n\n78\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.160\nsomething like that then yeah, you could\nprobably get in to the local logic and\n\n79\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.980\nthe way things work fairly easily.\n\n80\n00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.680\nBut some of these algorithms,\nthey get way, way,\n\n81\n00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.900\nway out there as far as\ntheir complexity goes.\n\n82\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.370\nYou look at them and\nyou just like, what the heck.\n\n83\n00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.010\n>> We've talked a little bit about\nthat in our previous episode,\n\n84\n00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.180\nhow as the technologies have increased, so\n\n85\n00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.650\nhave, now we can use that term,\nalgorithms, they've increased.\n\n86\n00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.840\nBecause as you say, the shifting three for\n\n87\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.430\nthe Cesar cipher, back in the day,\nthat was pretty clever, right?\n\n88\n00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.010\nIt wasn't something that many\npeople could figure out.\n\n89\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.090\nIt did keep that information secret.\n\n90\n00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.170\nWe look at it now, we think, oh I've\nseen that on the back of a cereal box,\n\n91\n00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.620\nit's no big deal.\n\n92\n00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:27.195\nSo you just see the progression\nof these algorithms and\n\n93\n00:05:27.195 --> 00:05:30.125\nthe stuff that they're doing today\nwith the computing power that we have\n\n94\n00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:35.055\navailable, and working with prime numbers,\nand combining multiple methods.\n\n95\n00:05:35.055 --> 00:05:37.465\nThey do get rather complex,\nthese algorithms.\n\n96\n00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:39.285\n>> Yes, they absolutely do.\n\n97\n00:05:39.285 --> 00:05:42.745\nAnd what's really fascinating about when\nyou look at an algorithm, I mean any one\n\n98\n00:05:42.745 --> 00:05:49.460\nof you can go out there and can look\nonline for, like, the RSA algorithm.\n\n99\n00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.640\nIt's not something that's hidden\nfrom view, you can look that up.\n\n100\n00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.670\nAnd some of you could go out there,\nlook at it, and say yeah,\n\n101\n00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.160\nI get it, I understand what that means and\nwhat that looks like.\n\n102\n00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.860\nProbably the most of us,\nwould look at it and going okay,\n\n103\n00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.810\nI'm not really sure, this is out of my\npay grade, I'm just not touching it.\n\n104\n00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.840\nIt's just fascinating when you\nlook at something like RSA,\n\n105\n00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.800\nit's an incredibly complex and\nwell thought out algorithm.\n\n106\n00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.140\nBut it's only a little tiny\n\n107\n00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.320\nthing on a piece of a paper or\non your screen, it's not much to look at.\n\n108\n00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.910\nYou expect to see something\nthat's a whole black board or\n\n109\n00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.930\nsomething full of stuff, like they always\nshow in the movies and stuff like that.\n\n110\n00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.960\nNo, they're not like that and you wouldn't\nhave an algorithm like that, because it's\n\n111\n00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.570\njust, it's too complex, there's too many\nplaces for potential errors to happen.\n\n112\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.100\nAnd so, we want something that's\nreliable and well thought out,\n\n113\n00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.140\ncan be repeated and\nit is able to predict certain things.\n\n114\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.620\nSo having those things on a blackboard,\ntoo many places for error.\n\n115\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.290\nSo seeing something like RSA, and being,\n\n116\n00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.870\nyou know yay big, is really not that\nsurprising when you look at it.\n\n117\n00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.430\nSeeing it looks that simple but\nit just ain't that simple.\n\n118\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.370\nThere's a whole lot happening there,\nin that space.\n\n119\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.350\nI mean,\nit's really just a fascinating thing.\n\n120\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.090\nYou can look at, for\nexample, you can go to,\n\n121\n00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.490\nI think it's like a, there's a college\nbookstore, I wanna say it's MIT,\n\n122\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:28.580\nyou can go to their college bookstore,\nand you wouldn't think about this,\n\n123\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.720\nbut they've got a shirt where you can get,\nit's a really nerdy thing,\n\n124\n00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.822\nI'm not saying you should do this,\nbut they have a T-shirt\n\n125\n00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:40.730\nthat's got the formula for light on it.\n\n126\n00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.971\nYou'll expect when your describing\nyou know a light, you expect\n\n127\n00:07:44.971 --> 00:07:49.767\nto see a lot of mathematical forms\ntelling you how light works and reacts.\n\n128\n00:07:49.767 --> 00:07:54.423\nIt's about that big, there's\nthe formula that explains how light\n\n129\n00:07:54.423 --> 00:07:58.845\nworks is like that big, you can get it,\nit fits on just one line.\n\n130\n00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:04.149\nA small line on a T-shirt, so it's, but\na lot's happening there, just to kind\n\n131\n00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:08.985\nof give you a little bit of comparison\nthere because just something kind of\n\n132\n00:08:08.985 --> 00:08:14.367\nmysterious somewhat as a cryptographic\nalgorithm that's one thing but lights,\n\n133\n00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:19.585\nsomething that we know, and see and\nhave to deal with all the time, that big?\n\n134\n00:08:19.585 --> 00:08:20.855\nWoah, hold on.\n\n135\n00:08:20.855 --> 00:08:24.705\n>> A good algorithm then kind of\nhides some of that complexity that's\n\n136\n00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:26.045\ngoing on in the background.\n\n137\n00:08:26.045 --> 00:08:31.575\n>> Yeah, you don't need a huge complex\nnasty thing to be an algorithm to get\n\n138\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.700\na good system, you know, so\nthat's an important part.\n\n139\n00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:42.145\nSo an algorithm, yes is just a formula\nsaying how something's gonna take place.\n\n140\n00:08:42.145 --> 00:08:45.007\nNow, they do sometimes, just to be fair,\n\n141\n00:08:45.007 --> 00:08:49.632\nthey do sometimes use the term\ncypher interchanges with algorithm.\n\n142\n00:08:49.632 --> 00:08:54.038\nAnd you can in some places use that and\nother places its not acceptable so\n\n143\n00:08:54.038 --> 00:08:58.739\nyou just kinda gotta get your bearings\nto see if you're in one of those places\n\n144\n00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:02.370\nthat you can use those\nterms interchangeably.\n\n145\n00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.230\nFor what we're talking about here you'll,\nwhen we'll talk about algorithm,\n\n146\n00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.740\nyou'll have an algorithm which'll be\nthe main formula and then cyphers\n\n147\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.500\nwould be things inside of that that\nsnap together to make the algorithm.\n\n148\n00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.720\n>> Individual components then within\nthere, if I say this algorithm has three\n\n149\n00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.690\nrounds of substitution, that substitution\nwould by a cypher within my algorithm.\n\n150\n00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.830\n>> Exactly, exactly or a block, or\na stream or the seas or whatever.\n\n151\n00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.560\nYou could throw all those ones in\nthere and mix and match them and\n\n152\n00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.130\ncreate an algorithm.\n\n153\n00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.610\nSo just make sure that\nyou are aware of that.\n\n154\n00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.970\nMake sure that if you encounter that,\nthat you've got your bearings\n\n155\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:48.200\nbecause you can move out of this test and\ngo some place else and\n\n156\n00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.540\nyou start using an algorithm\nthat's cyphered differently here,\n\n157\n00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.260\nyou go someplace else,\nthey'll like no, it's the same thing.\n\n158\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.170\nWhy are you using to apply\nit to two different things?\n\n159\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:03.435\nSo, it's one of those\nthings that whatever.\n\n160\n00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:06.120\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nwe've got our algorithms and\n\n161\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.320\nthen there's something we use along\nwith those algorithms, right?\n\n162\n00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.570\n>> Yeah, that would be the key.\n\n163\n00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.230\nThe key is an important\npart of this because\n\n164\n00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.020\nan algorithm just isn't\ngonna work on it's own.\n\n165\n00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.080\nIt has to have a combinations and\n\n166\n00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.670\nways that can actually be adjusted\nwhen you look at a algorithm.\n\n167\n00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:33.700\nAlgorithm defines something called a key\nspace which is the range of possible\n\n168\n00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.420\nvalues that it can have.\n\n169\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.210\nAnd key spaces can be\nof all different sizes.\n\n170\n00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:44.610\nGenerally speaking, very generally\nspeaking the size of a key space\n\n171\n00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:49.770\nis going to give you, as it gets\nlarger it gives you a reasonably\n\n172\n00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:54.860\nstronger system that's going to\nincrease as that key space gets bigger.\n\n173\n00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.499\nThe reason why I say it's not\nalways going to be that way is\n\n174\n00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.560\nyeah having more keys\nsounds like oh great.\n\n175\n00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.640\nThere's more keys out there.\n\n176\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.900\nSo there's more things that people\nhave to search when they do, for\n\n177\n00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.338\nexample, a forced attack that\nthey do to find the correct key.\n\n178\n00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:14.370\nThat's true, however.\n\n179\n00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.920\nIt doesn't mean that it's always the case.\n\n180\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.390\nIt depends on how you create those keys,\ntoo.\n\n181\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:25.830\nYou could go through and\nfind a credit key space that does little\n\n182\n00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:31.510\nthings in it that reveal\nhow things are done.\n\n183\n00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.870\nAnd there's been cases of that, where\nyou look at keys for a specific system.\n\n184\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:41.450\nAnd there are certain characters\nthat appear or don't appear,\n\n185\n00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:46.860\nsequences that emerge, that if someone\nwere to do an exhaustive key search,\n\n186\n00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.480\nand they see those things start to emerge,\nthen they can start digging in, figuring\n\n187\n00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.040\nout how all the rest of these are done,\nand how to break that actual algorithm.\n\n188\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.530\nSo it doesn't necessary mean\nthat just by having a large\n\n189\n00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.160\nkey space that you got\na much stronger algorithm.\n\n190\n00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.910\nTypically is the case but\ndon't take it like it is 100%.\n\n191\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.030\nHow you generate the key, too.\n\n192\n00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.430\nSo that's a very big part of it.\n\n193\n00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.800\nBut a key just to kind of to\nput that in the proper context.\n\n194\n00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.510\nSo we have key space that is filled\nwith keys, so what is an individual key?\n\n195\n00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.350\nWhat does that mean?\n\n196\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:25.880\nAn individual key is just, I look at\nit really as a specific combination or\n\n197\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:32.250\nspecific, specific code\nrepresenting how cryptography,\n\n198\n00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.320\nthe encryption or decryption process is\ngoing to take place at that point in time.\n\n199\n00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.980\nAnother way of looking at this, if that's\nkind of, gives you some fuzziness or\n\n200\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:47.720\nwhatever there, and I know it can,\nis to think of it in terms of a lock.\n\n201\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.210\nYou can go and\nfigure out how a lock works.\n\n202\n00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:57.120\nThere's plenty of documentation on that\nto figure out how a lock works, but\n\n203\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.160\njust by knowing how a lock works and\nhow it's built doesn't tell you what\n\n204\n00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.670\nthe key looks like, the specific key that\ngoes into that lock, what it looks like.\n\n205\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.820\nSo, that's a big, big part of it,\nis that it tells you that hey,\n\n206\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.290\nthere's all these pins, and\nslots that can be cut in it.\n\n207\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.630\nAnd different heights,\nand different orders.\n\n208\n00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.930\nBut all those combinations\nmake a huge number of possible\n\n209\n00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.850\nkeys that could be created.\n\n210\n00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:28.490\nBut there's only one that will fit that\nlock that you have in front of you.\n\n211\n00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:35.220\nSo knowing those things isn't\nnecessarily gonna get you any further,\n\n212\n00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.280\nbut that one will tell you hey, that's the\none that allows the process to continue.\n\n213\n00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.720\nJust like you can use\na combination lock in there too.\n\n214\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.660\nJust because you know how a combination\nlock works you can look those up any\n\n215\n00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.140\nplace you want.\n\n216\n00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.830\nDoesn't tell you which way you have to\nspin that dial to make that unlock.\n\n217\n00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.310\nSo with that bigger key space then which\nmeans there's more keys to try which\n\n218\n00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:59.590\nhopefully makes that algorithm a little\nbit stronger but not always the case.\n\n219\n00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:00.360\n>> Yeah not always.\n\n220\n00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.540\nIt's how it's created and\nthere's also the length of it as well.\n\n221\n00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.240\nIt's the length of a key will also\ngo towards making it stronger.\n\n222\n00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.180\nYou know there seems to be some confusion\nthere tends to be some confusion coming\n\n223\n00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:18.210\nout about that well if you\nhave a large key space or\n\n224\n00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.790\nif you have a longer key, you know those\nthings, if you have that and typically\n\n225\n00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.430\npeople go right towards the longer key\nlike longer key, stronger algorithm.\n\n226\n00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.800\nYeah, I could make a long key\nthat's all zeros, to be happy.\n\n227\n00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.140\nYou know, it's, it's a horrible algorithm.\n\n228\n00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.520\n>> There's only two possible keys.\n\n229\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.068\n>> Yeah.\n>> 20 zeros or 20 ones and\n\n230\n00:14:37.068 --> 00:14:38.690\nthat's all you get right.\n\n231\n00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.230\n>> Yeah that's it.\n\n232\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.720\nYou can push that point home again and\nagain and again and have it.\n\n233\n00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.280\nYou can have an algorithm that\ngenerates 20 character keys but\n\n234\n00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.760\nthose keys, according to the rules of the\nalgorithms, say, no special characters can\n\n235\n00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.880\nbe part of that key, and\nyou can only have uppercase letters and\n\n236\n00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.046\nyou can only use the numbers\none through four.\n\n237\n00:15:02.046 --> 00:15:04.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, good, that's really strong.\n\n238\n00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.410\nWe know it's not, so that's something\ndefinitely to keep in mind,\n\n239\n00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.110\nhas to be all those things together\nto make an effective system.\n\n240\n00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.700\n>> So a combination of length and\n\n241\n00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.220\nkey space is really what gives\nus those strong algorithms.\n\n242\n00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.070\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n243\n00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.010\nIt has to be all those\nthings mixed together.\n\n244\n00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:25.110\nIt has to be carefully\nconsidered when you do this.\n\n245\n00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.670\nSo there's actually one other term,\nthough,\n\n246\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.960\nI listed here to kind of mention it.\n\n247\n00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.870\nActually two other terms\nthat can relate to keys.\n\n248\n00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:42.340\nIt's one you may be completely brand new\nto you is something called key stretching.\n\n249\n00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.886\nDon't hear the term used all that much.\n\n250\n00:15:45.886 --> 00:15:49.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's still one of those things I'm\n\n251\n00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.426\nlike, what?\n\n252\n00:15:50.426 --> 00:15:54.679\nWhat it is, it's a key stretch, and\nit's just a way of strengthening the key,\n\n253\n00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:58.934\nbasically by doing almost the same thing\nthat you have with hashing where you put\n\n254\n00:15:58.934 --> 00:15:59.585\nsalt in it.\n\n255\n00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:05.570\nWhere you mix in some randomness or extra\nstuff in it to make it harder to crack.\n\n256\n00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.820\nIt's kind of the same thing except you're\ndoing it for keys now instead of for\n\n257\n00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.350\nan actual hash on the back end.\n\n258\n00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:13.930\nThat's what key stretching is.\n\n259\n00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.430\nIf you hear that it's\na way of strengthening.\n\n260\n00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.650\nA key to make it, so it's stronger\nthan it would have been otherwise.\n\n261\n00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.486\nAnd then the other thing to mention\nwhen you're talking about keys and\n\n262\n00:16:25.486 --> 00:16:30.555\nan output of a cryptographic\nalgorithm is entropy.\n\n263\n00:16:30.555 --> 00:16:36.035\nEntropy is just kind of a fancy way\nof saying you've got some randomness,\n\n264\n00:16:36.035 --> 00:16:39.425\nor some unpredictability\nin the output of this.\n\n265\n00:16:39.425 --> 00:16:45.255\nThe more unpredictability that you get\nin the output, it's harder ascertaining\n\n266\n00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:48.575\nan actual pattern on the output,\nthe harder it becomes to actually crack.\n\n267\n00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:52.940\nIf someone can see a pattern,\ncan extract a pattern then that goes\n\n268\n00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:57.740\nincreasingly longer ways\ntowards breaking the actual\n\n269\n00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.980\nsystem so\nyou don't want those patterns to emerge.\n\n270\n00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.010\n>> And it helps prevent that then.\n\n271\n00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.920\n>> Yes,\nthat's exactly what it's supposed to do.\n\n272\n00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.780\n>> All right, and\nthen you got down here cryptanalysis.\n\n273\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:10.752\nWell that sounds like a good one.\n\n274\n00:17:10.752 --> 00:17:13.390\n>> Yeah, cryptanalysis,\n\n275\n00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.950\nit's quite commonly referred\nto also as code breaking.\n\n276\n00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:20.410\nSome people might have\na big problem with that.\n\n277\n00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.745\nI'm not one of those people.\n\n278\n00:17:21.745 --> 00:17:22.587\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n279\n00:17:22.587 --> 00:17:27.143\ncryptanalysis is just dealing\nwith breaking cryptosystems.\n\n280\n00:17:27.143 --> 00:17:32.574\nTaking a look at them, breaking them,\nand even developing techniques and\n\n281\n00:17:32.574 --> 00:17:36.060\nmethodologies, and even new cryptosystems.\n\n282\n00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.030\nThat's what would fit in there.\n\n283\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:44.980\nIt's a huge area that you have\nin the cryptographic field,\n\n284\n00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.080\nbecause someone that encrypts something\nisn't just gonna give you their keys.\n\n285\n00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.950\nHey, I wanna know what's yours,\nwhy don't you send it over to so and so?\n\n286\n00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:52.910\nThey're not gonna give you a key for\n\n287\n00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.580\nthat, otherwise why would they even\nbother encrypting it in the first place?\n\n288\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.080\nWhat cryptanalysis does or one of the\nthings it does it actually helps recover\n\n289\n00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.940\nthose keys or determine how a system\nworks so it can be broken and so\n\n290\n00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:11.590\nit plays a big, big, big role, but\nit also takes some serious horsepower and\n\n291\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:18.316\nbrainpower to really kind of break\nthese systems, especially nowadays.\n\n292\n00:18:18.316 --> 00:18:21.641\n>> Interesting, so cryptanalysis is all\nabout trying to break those code and\n\n293\n00:18:21.641 --> 00:18:24.966\nI guess that's probably been around\nas long as cryptography as long we've\n\n294\n00:18:24.966 --> 00:18:28.448\ngot a reason to encrypt it that means\nsomebody that's not supposed to have it,\n\n295\n00:18:28.448 --> 00:18:29.639\nwants that information.\n\n296\n00:18:29.639 --> 00:18:31.350\n>> Yeah, anytime you have a secret,\n\n297\n00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.720\nsomeone's gonna wanna know that\nsecret if it wasn't for them.\n\n298\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.860\nYou're figuring out a way to\nbreak the system and get in, and\n\n299\n00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.740\nfigure out what that person's\ntrying to keep secret from you.\n\n300\n00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.910\nSo, cryptanalysis, while it may\nnot have always been called that,\n\n301\n00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.600\nit's something that's been around for\na long, long, long time.\n\n302\n00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:54.660\nIf you go back a few hundred years, before\nthey formally called it cryptanalysis,\n\n303\n00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.580\nthey had things called black chambers and\nstuff like that.\n\n304\n00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.370\nBlack chambers were would be\nthe equivalent of things like the NSA and\n\n305\n00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:07.530\nstuff like that nowadays that\nare dedicated towards breaking codes.\n\n306\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.740\nThat's a large part of their mission.\n\n307\n00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.060\nOf course, they've got to be more and\nmore and more complex since the original,\n\n308\n00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:19.110\nthe very first black chamber showed up in,\nit was I believe Vienna, Austria.\n\n309\n00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.860\nIt was the first place that actually\nhad something dedicated to that.\n\n310\n00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:27.860\nSo, they've come a long, long, long\nway but the purpose is still the same.\n\n311\n00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.800\nIs that someone needs to be\nable to break these codes and\n\n312\n00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.070\nso cryptanalysis is all kind\nof a valve around that and\n\n313\n00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.430\ngone through all sorts of weaks and\nbound all over the years.\n\n314\n00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.140\nIntroduction of computing power and\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n315\n00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.070\nIt's fascinating to think of that you\nlook at some of the stuff they had that\n\n316\n00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:52.500\neven a few decades ago, you're\ntalking like early, mid 20th century.\n\n317\n00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.850\nYou're talking that they're breaking\nsome of the systems computers.\n\n318\n00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:57.605\nAt some point, someone had a slide rule.\n\n319\n00:19:57.605 --> 00:19:58.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Some\n\n320\n00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.590\nof you may know what a slide rule is.\n\n321\n00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.950\nIt's somebody had something like that,\nor just a sheet of paper,\n\n322\n00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.850\nis breaking the system with that.\n\n323\n00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.730\nAnd nowadays,\nthey've brought computers into the mix.\n\n324\n00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.530\nBut it's the same.\n\n325\n00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.430\nIt's the same thing that's happening.\n\n326\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.150\nThey're trying to break and analyze it and\nfigure out how these things work.\n\n327\n00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.740\n>> All right.\nSo we got a lot of different terms.\n\n328\n00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:22.280\nI'm sure that's not an inclusive list that\nwe need to be familiar with for the exam.\n\n329\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.070\n>> Yeah, just to make sure there's\nsome other ones I just kind of\n\n330\n00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.200\ncasually threw in there.\n\n331\n00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.422\nThere were things like ciphertext and\nplaintext,\n\n332\n00:20:29.422 --> 00:20:33.750\nthat's what goes in and\ncomes out of the encryption process.\n\n333\n00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.918\nThat's what those two mean.\n\n334\n00:20:35.918 --> 00:20:42.330\nI threw in some other ones,\nthe encryption, decryption.\n\n335\n00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:47.173\nNot a confusing term, but\nit's one that they're gonna throw in.\n\n336\n00:20:47.173 --> 00:20:52.148\nThere's plenty of other ones that\nwe are gonna hit as we go through,\n\n337\n00:20:52.148 --> 00:20:57.040\nbecause we just don't wanna bombard\nyou about terms and advance,\n\n338\n00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.144\nbut those are the ones you\nare gonna know right up front,\n\n339\n00:21:01.144 --> 00:21:05.372\nto be at least reasonably\nsuccessful understanding up.\n\n340\n00:21:05.372 --> 00:21:08.641\nSo, the other staff to go\nbeyond reasonable as coming up,\n\n341\n00:21:08.641 --> 00:21:12.046\nthat which need to be reasonably\noriented to the material and\n\n342\n00:21:12.046 --> 00:21:14.670\nthen we're gonna introduce\nsome other ones.\n\n343\n00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.120\nBut make sure you're aware of those ones,\nand\n\n344\n00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.390\ndon't get those ones kind of all mixed\nup or messed up or anything on the exam.\n\n345\n00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.570\nPeople do, and that's why I kinda\nwanted to call attention to these\n\n346\n00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.960\nby telling you these terms.\n\n347\n00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.810\nIs that you can very\neasily get messed up on.\n\n348\n00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.870\nBut we're gonna see those, and\n\n349\n00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.020\nwe're gonna see some other\nstuff as we go on through it.\n\n350\n00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.380\n>> Good to know.\n\n351\n00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.930\nAnd then I know next on our\ntopic we still got a little bit.\n\n352\n00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.195\nYou want to talk about some\ncipher types and methods.\n\n353\n00:21:45.195 --> 00:21:46.171\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah,\n\n354\n00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:51.125\nwe can start setting the stage for\nthat and what's going on.\n\n355\n00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:55.420\nBecause when we talked\nabout algorithms here,\n\n356\n00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.600\nalgorithms we said were the whole formula.\n\n357\n00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.350\nWhere everything kind of just snaps into\nplace and said this is what we have.\n\n358\n00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:06.170\nSo, what we're moving towards as we get\ninto the end of this as we go in to\n\n359\n00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:13.310\nthe next section is the actual cyphers is\nwe have really two types of cyphers now.\n\n360\n00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.420\nCyphers well as terms that it can be\n\n361\n00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.860\nvery messy because it\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.600\n>> Seems like\n\n363\n00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.240\neveryone's got a different spin on it.\n\n364\n00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.290\nThis is an algorithm, this is a cypher,\n\n365\n00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.430\nthen some people are like no,\nit's the same thing.\n\n366\n00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.750\nIt's just there's no\ndifference between those two.\n\n367\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:35.797\nFor example, I just used the Caesar\ncipher as an example of an algorithm.\n\n368\n00:22:35.797 --> 00:22:40.552\n>> [LAUGH] That always\nbothered me just a little bit.\n\n369\n00:22:40.552 --> 00:22:44.105\n>> On it's own it actually\ndoes count as an algorithm,\n\n370\n00:22:44.105 --> 00:22:50.410\nit does have a definitive process there\nin how to convert something to the other.\n\n371\n00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.040\nBut, when we look at some of\nthese other ones in here,\n\n372\n00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.990\nthese are kind of clearly on their own,\njust\n\n373\n00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:01.230\ntruly ciphers you probably wouldn't use\nthem on their own all that much if at all.\n\n374\n00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.920\nYou know things like block and\n\n375\n00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:08.080\nstream ciphers are very definite building\nblocks that go within an algorithm.\n\n376\n00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.360\nAlgorithms do use those as\na way to crunch the data and\n\n377\n00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.910\ndigest the data when they're\nchanging from one form to another.\n\n378\n00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.970\nIf you're creating a new algorithm,\nyou could snap those things in.\n\n379\n00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:24.990\nNowadays, the Caesar cipher pretty much is\nnever used on its own as an algorithm in\n\n380\n00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:31.350\na serious context, so what they're doing\nis they're taking the Caesar algorithm,\n\n381\n00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.310\nwhich it would have been more correctly\nbe called couple thousand years ago.\n\n382\n00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.034\nThey're taking that and\nsticking it inside the newer algorithms,\n\n383\n00:23:39.034 --> 00:23:43.671\nand now it's actually a building block, so\nit could more accurately be described as\n\n384\n00:23:43.671 --> 00:23:47.607\na cipher with the way they substitute\nit and move stuff around in there.\n\n385\n00:23:47.607 --> 00:23:52.876\nSo, it's just an example of how\nsometimes these terms can get\n\n386\n00:23:52.876 --> 00:23:59.176\nvery kind of squishy and and moved\naround and messed around and confused.\n\n387\n00:23:59.176 --> 00:24:03.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I tell you I mean we did all those\n\n388\n00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:08.008\nshows on cryptography,\nthat whole series on it,\n\n389\n00:24:08.008 --> 00:24:12.640\nand I can tell you just\nfrom writing that book.\n\n390\n00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.290\nBetween copy editor and\nmyself we're going back and\n\n391\n00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.350\nforth, you're using algorithm\nover here and cipher over here,\n\n392\n00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:23.640\nit's like, that's cuz of the way\nthey're supposed to be used.\n\n393\n00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.720\nThey were and I wasn't trying to be\na wise guy or anything about it.\n\n394\n00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.810\nThey were going, they were looking at\ntheir book, and they had to look at these\n\n395\n00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:37.570\nterms, and they were looking at stuff\nonline, and it was confusing to them.\n\n396\n00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:42.720\nAnd now the guy that was my tech\neditor for it, a good friend of mine,\n\n397\n00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.860\nhe's also a crypto junkie on it and\nhe was going through and saying,\n\n398\n00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.110\nyeah it really depends on which text and\nwhich source you look at.\n\n399\n00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:56.472\nAmazingly enough, if you go into\nthe SISP beyond here, depending on\n\n400\n00:24:56.472 --> 00:25:00.651\nwhich book on the SISP you get, they will\nspin those terms all over the place and.\n\n401\n00:25:00.651 --> 00:25:02.945\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Oh, my head hurts.\n\n402\n00:25:02.945 --> 00:25:04.965\n>> Oh, it's making me hurt already,\nthinking about it.\n\n403\n00:25:04.965 --> 00:25:06.269\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n404\n00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:07.415\n>> So you\n\n405\n00:25:07.415 --> 00:25:09.415\ngotta be kinda careful about that.\n\n406\n00:25:09.415 --> 00:25:13.720\nBut yeah, there is a block, a stream,\na transposition, a substitution cipher.\n\n407\n00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:19.710\nThat actually break stuff down specific\nways like the block cipher breaks stuff\n\n408\n00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:25.670\ndown in specific chunks called blocks and\nthose are predefined by the algorithm.\n\n409\n00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:30.660\nAnd we have an actual stream cipher,\nwhich works in the bit level.\n\n410\n00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.970\nSo that offers us something else and\nthen we have transposition and\n\n411\n00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.430\nsubstitution one.\n\n412\n00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:42.690\nWhich the transposition just takes what\nyour plain text originally looks like,\n\n413\n00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.900\nand moves it in some order that says hey,\nthere you go, I just moved them around.\n\n414\n00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.250\nI haven't encoded them into something\nelse, I've just taken them and\n\n415\n00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.135\njust moved them into a different pattern.\n\n416\n00:25:53.135 --> 00:25:57.695\nAnd that pattern, if you know\nthe rules to create that pattern,\n\n417\n00:25:57.695 --> 00:26:01.365\nknow the rules to reverse that pattern.\n\n418\n00:26:01.365 --> 00:26:06.455\nIf I'm taking every odd character and\ndoing\n\n419\n00:26:06.455 --> 00:26:11.250\nsome weird swap with those, and every even\ncharacter I'm doing some swap with those.\n\n420\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:17.810\nThat would be a rule set to tell me how\nthe transpositions are gonna take place.\n\n421\n00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:21.110\nAnd then substitution, substitution's\nreally one of the easiest ones.\n\n422\n00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:27.235\nSubstitution would be something like our\npig pen cypher, if you remember that.\n\n423\n00:26:27.235 --> 00:26:32.695\nWhere we substituted a character\nin this case a letter for\n\n424\n00:26:32.695 --> 00:26:37.025\na specific shape, without a dot or\nwith a dot in it.\n\n425\n00:26:37.025 --> 00:26:42.220\nAnd that represented what it was\nbefore it went through the process.\n\n426\n00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:48.440\nYou know, so those are just some ways you\ncould actually use cyphers or what cyphers\n\n427\n00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.510\nlook like and you can shove those in to an\nalgorithm to make something more complex.\n\n428\n00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.630\nAll those cyphers mentioned plus other\nones you could you pick a combination.\n\n429\n00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.230\nYou can just snap them together\nin whatever combination you want.\n\n430\n00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.190\nAnd make something out of it.\n\n431\n00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.720\nAnd you an actually come up with\nusing very simple building blocks.\n\n432\n00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.010\nCome up with some very strong systems.\n\n433\n00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:14.520\nSo it's not worth you or\nit's not wise to you\n\n434\n00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.500\nI guess is a better way to put it, to look\nat these things going, oh that's simple.\n\n435\n00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.328\nI can figure that out.\n\n436\n00:27:20.328 --> 00:27:25.670\nYeah, on its own you can figure that out,\nbut I take just the substitution cipher\n\n437\n00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:30.260\nand transition cipher and take plaintext\nand feed it through one then the other.\n\n438\n00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.422\nI've ruined your whole day right there.\n\n439\n00:27:32.422 --> 00:27:33.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz that's gonna,\n\n440\n00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.570\nyou'll figure it out eventually.\n\n441\n00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:36.860\nThere's ways to figure that out.\n\n442\n00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.190\nBut it ain't something that\nyou're just gonna go through and\n\n443\n00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.330\nget your Flintstones decoder ring out\nof your cereal box and figure it out.\n\n444\n00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:43.430\nIt ain't gonna happen.\n\n445\n00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:49.290\n>> It's gonna be a lot of Mountain Dew and\na lot of bags of Doritos.\n\n446\n00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.100\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n447\n00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.970\nSo don't take those individual ciphers for\ngranted.\n\n448\n00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:58.520\nThose individual ciphers on their own\nare fairly simple in most cases, but\n\n449\n00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:04.650\nmerging them together to make something\nelse, really goes a long way.\n\n450\n00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.415\nI mean, you can look at so many algorithms\nunderneath the hood and you'll see\n\n451\n00:28:09.415 --> 00:28:13.925\nrecognizable spots of the sequence of\nstuff that we've talked about here and\n\n452\n00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:15.545\nin our cryptography course.\n\n453\n00:28:15.545 --> 00:28:19.970\nYou can look at those things and say,\noh well, I know what's going on there.\n\n454\n00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.180\nBut yeah,\nthey've done it like a dozen times.\n\n455\n00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.965\nPlus they've added on a bunch of other\nstuff, and so it's not so easy anymore.\n\n456\n00:28:25.965 --> 00:28:29.520\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well Sean,\nlot of good information there,\n\n457\n00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.380\na lot of terminology.\n\n458\n00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.950\nWe know CompTIA likes their\nterminology on their exam, so\n\n459\n00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.070\nwe've gotta know this stuff.\n\n460\n00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.340\nAnd not to mention it's gonna make\nunderstanding all the rest of this\n\n461\n00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.250\ninformation a whole lot easier\nif you understand the terms\n\n462\n00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:42.610\nthat Sean's using when he explains it.\n\n463\n00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.160\nSo, great information there.\n\n464\n00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.770\nAnything else we wanna\nthrow into that episode?\n\n465\n00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:52.760\n>> I would recommend for anybody out there\nthat's gonna be sitting in this exam.\n\n466\n00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.290\nWhen you're studying, this and the terms\nare one of the things that I always,\n\n467\n00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.650\nalways recommend, go get some flash cards.\n\n468\n00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:02.860\nIt's low tech, works,\nget the flash cards and\n\n469\n00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:07.070\nstart putting them on there and\nmake sure you got it committed to memory.\n\n470\n00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:12.230\nAnd if you really need an extra little\npush on the terms, go to CompTIA's site,\n\n471\n00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.530\nyou can actually download, what is it,\n\n472\n00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:19.710\na PDF up there of what's on really any\nof their exams you can do this for.\n\n473\n00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.650\nBut get that and\n\n474\n00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.780\nthey will tell you the terms you're\nsupposed to know on there too.\n\n475\n00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.720\nSo build some flash cards and make sure\nyou've got those things committed to\n\n476\n00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:33.510\nmemory as it pertains to the CASP,\nand then you'll be in good shape.\n\n477\n00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.970\nThat's, terminology kills a lot of people.\n\n478\n00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.340\n>> All right, well, there you go.\n\n479\n00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.370\nGet your flash cards.\n\n480\n00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.960\nGet this stuff memorized.\n\n481\n00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.240\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's all for this particular episode.\n\n482\n00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.120\nWe hope you enjoyed it.\n\n483\n00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.530\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:13.073 --> 00:00:14.351\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:16.600\nAnd with me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n6\n00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.550\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n7\n00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.460\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n8\n00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.120\nHow you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.160\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.200\nWe are continuing on in our CASP series.\n\n11\n00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.720\nAnd in this episode, Sean, we're going\nto take a look at symmetric encryption.\n\n12\n00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.520\nSo we've kind of talked about\nwhat encryption was, and\n\n13\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.220\nsome of the different goals.\n\n14\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.220\nSymmetric encryption is more of a type,\nor a method, of encryption.\n\n15\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.870\n>> Yes it is.\n\n16\n00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.525\nIt defines one specific areas\nof encryption as a whole.\n\n17\n00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:49.645\nWe can say we have encryption and\n\n18\n00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:53.675\nthat's a way of converting from\nplain text to cipher text,\n\n19\n00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:57.305\nand then we have decryption going\nthe other way, and that's all correct.\n\n20\n00:00:57.305 --> 00:00:58.615\nThat's very generic.\n\n21\n00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:03.605\nThat's just like saying you went to\nthe doctor or you want to be a doctor.\n\n22\n00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.045\nIt's, okay, what type of doctor?\n\n23\n00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:11.200\nIt's just not enough to\ngo down that route, or\n\n24\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.150\njust saying you're\nworking with encryption.\n\n25\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.770\nSo when we're talking about\nsymmetric encryption,\n\n26\n00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.000\nit's further clarifying what\narea we're talking about.\n\n27\n00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.400\nAnd it's important to make that\nclarification because the different types\n\n28\n00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.335\nof cryptographic systems that we have,\nand we're going to explore here,\n\n29\n00:01:29.335 --> 00:01:33.900\nthey don't all do the same\nthing the same way.\n\n30\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.160\nAnd some of the things that one is\ngood at, another one is horrible at.\n\n31\n00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.960\nSo you really have to know each and\nwhat their strong points and\n\n32\n00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.600\nweak points are and what fits within that,\n\n33\n00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.742\nbefore you can really kind of know\nif it's the proper one for the job.\n\n34\n00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:52.040\nYou can mess up on this and\nit's an easy one.\n\n35\n00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.530\nIt's an easy one to mess up on.\n\n36\n00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.540\nI can totally understand.\n\n37\n00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.460\nSo what we're going to try to do is get\nrid of that confusion by explaining\n\n38\n00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.030\nwhat symmetric is.\n\n39\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.650\nAnd then just mention some of the ciphers\nor algorithms that are present in this,\n\n40\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.730\nso you can really kind of understand,\nhey we got a symmetric system.\n\n41\n00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.417\nThis is what they're good at,\nthis is what they're poor at and\n\n42\n00:02:13.417 --> 00:02:15.980\nthen these are the ones\nthat fit in that category.\n\n43\n00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.768\nIf this is your first time\nencountering this, yeah,\n\n44\n00:02:17.768 --> 00:02:19.190\nyou're going to have some confusion.\n\n45\n00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.640\nI totally understand that.\n\n46\n00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.680\nI had that when I got into the field.\n\n47\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.840\nI think most people did.\n\n48\n00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.280\nWhat I got years ago, it was like,\nI kind of had to think about it, and\n\n49\n00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.610\nthen a little bit more, I had to\ndraw stuff out and I was like, okay.\n\n50\n00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.270\nAnd it just gels at some point.\n\n51\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.460\nSo, if you're kind of\na little kind of shaky or\n\n52\n00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.310\nwhatever on it, don't worry about it.\n\n53\n00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.125\nWe'll do everything we can here to\nkind of set you on the right path, and\n\n54\n00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:46.914\nmake sure you're in good shape.\n\n55\n00:02:46.914 --> 00:02:50.919\nSo that's the intro.\n\n56\n00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.975\n>> Sean is here to take care of us,\n[LAUGH] I like it.\n\n57\n00:02:52.975 --> 00:02:56.231\n[CROSSTALK] All right so\nSean when I think of the term symmetric,\n\n58\n00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:59.927\nI'm thinking back to like I don't know,\ngosh, biology or art class.\n\n59\n00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:04.278\nSymmetrical meaning something that\nwas kind of the same on both sides.\n\n60\n00:03:04.278 --> 00:03:09.210\n>> Yeah,\nyou could basically mirror it over, yeah.\n\n61\n00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.920\nYou're correct.\n\n62\n00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.320\nWe do have symmetry in biology you\nknow where like the human body,\n\n63\n00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.040\nyou can cut it in half\nright down the center.\n\n64\n00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.958\nIs that too gross for people?\n\n65\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Who's eating lunch in their time zone?\n\n66\n00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.600\nI'll be a little more graphic,\nbut yeah, the human body,\n\n67\n00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.000\nif you cut it down the middle,\nit's more or less symmetric.\n\n68\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.770\nYou've got, you can take some drawings and\nstuff like that, and\n\n69\n00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.210\njust lay a mirror on it.\n\n70\n00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.357\nAnd the drawing will be identical and\nlooks complete.\n\n71\n00:03:41.357 --> 00:03:43.230\nSo you definitely have that.\n\n72\n00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.590\nSo it's something that when you\nthink of it in those terms,\n\n73\n00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.950\nit's something that has, so really kind\nof the same thing present on either side.\n\n74\n00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.760\nAnd so that gets you a long way towards\nreally understanding what symmetric is.\n\n75\n00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.470\nAnd if you use something like that,\nor think of it in those ways.\n\n76\n00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.220\n>> And I'm assuming we're not\nfolding the algorithm in half and\n\n77\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.274\nseeing if it's the same, so- [LAUGH]\n>> They're ruined, man.\n\n78\n00:04:03.274 --> 00:04:05.320\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n79\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.145\n>> Yeah see, symmetric you just do-\n\n80\n00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:08.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n81\n00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.720\n>> You actually could kind of say that in\n\n82\n00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.050\na way, it's doing that, but it's obviously\nnot literally, but it actually does.\n\n83\n00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.065\nThere is some truth behind that,\nbecause we have a symmetric algorithm,\n\n84\n00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:28.675\nwe have an algorithm that really,\n\n85\n00:04:28.675 --> 00:04:33.535\nwhen we look at it, has a same key is\nused on both sides of the operation.\n\n86\n00:04:33.535 --> 00:04:36.705\nSo it means if you want to go one way,\nyou feed it the algorithm and\n\n87\n00:04:36.705 --> 00:04:40.155\nyou drop the key in, and\nyou get something out the other side.\n\n88\n00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:44.291\nIf you want to reverse that operation, you\nfeed it back through the same algorithm,\n\n89\n00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:46.050\nyou drop the same key in, and boom.\n\n90\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.070\nSame thing comes out, or the original\nstuff comes out the other side.\n\n91\n00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.250\nSo you're seeing the situation where,\nthe same key, or really\n\n92\n00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.950\njust one key can be used on either side of\nthat, so there's symmetry there, that you\n\n93\n00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.550\ncan have a copy of it on both sides, same\none and just back and forth all day long.\n\n94\n00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.126\n>> So it kind of reminded me earlier\nyou used an example of a padlock or\n\n95\n00:05:08.126 --> 00:05:09.370\nsomething like that.\n\n96\n00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.560\nOr I'm thinking about the lock\non my front door, or on my car.\n\n97\n00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.330\nAnd I use that one key to open that door,\nand get in.\n\n98\n00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.620\nI use that same key to lock it.\n\n99\n00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.520\nAnd so you're saying the same thing's\ngoing on here, using this one key to maybe\n\n100\n00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.080\ntake that plain text, run it through\nthat algorithm, output that cipher text.\n\n101\n00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.720\nAnd then it's the same key used\nif I want to go the other way.\n\n102\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.686\nTake cipher text, feed it through,\nand get my plain text back out.\n\n103\n00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:36.820\n>> Yeah, absolutely,\nthat's 100% how it works.\n\n104\n00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.080\nTo look at the algorithm slash cipher,\n\n105\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.760\ncause we did go through and\nhave that discussion.\n\n106\n00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.780\n>> Yeah true. [LAUGH] >> It's the Caesar\ncipher slash algorithm depending on what\n\n107\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.020\ntime period you're looking at, when you\nlook at that, that is something that is\n\n108\n00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.540\nvery clearly a symmetric\nsystem because it uses\n\n109\n00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.850\na key to encrypt it and\nuses the same key to decrypt it.\n\n110\n00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:02.800\nYou have to do it.\n\n111\n00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.510\nIf you shift something\na certain number of spaces, you\n\n112\n00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.570\nhave to shift it the same number of spaces\nto get back what you had originally.\n\n113\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.770\nSo it's very clearly a symmetric system.\n\n114\n00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.280\nSymmetric systems you'll note that all\nthe mathematics and everything excluded,\n\n115\n00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.560\nthey tend to be very, very simple\nsystems in the scheme of things.\n\n116\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.810\nAnd they've been in use for\nages and ages and ages.\n\n117\n00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.200\nIn many different forms but\nthey've been used for many many ages and\n\n118\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.900\nthey were used all the way up till and\neven today,\n\n119\n00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.215\nthey were the primary way of\ndoing encryption slash decryption\n\n120\n00:06:41.215 --> 00:06:46.755\nuntil just about the middle of the 20th\ncentury or a little bit after.\n\n121\n00:06:46.755 --> 00:06:50.815\nProbably about three quarters of the way\nthrough the 20th century, about the 70's,\n\n122\n00:06:50.815 --> 00:06:55.345\nsomewhere in there, that we had stuff\nthat came in as alternatives or\n\n123\n00:06:55.345 --> 00:06:59.965\nways to enhance existing systems\nthat we didn't have before or\n\n124\n00:06:59.965 --> 00:07:02.980\nwe couldn't properly implement before.\n\n125\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.735\nThat's a story for another time.\n\n126\n00:07:05.735 --> 00:07:07.420\nBecause we will talk about that.\n\n127\n00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.350\nBut yeah, symmetric systems do tend\nto be very, very, very simplistic.\n\n128\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.610\nAnd that's a plus in a number of\nways because one of the things that\n\n129\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.080\nsymmetric systems are very good at is they\nare very good at processing bulk data.\n\n130\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.640\nIf you just shove a lot of stuff through\nit, it can process it pretty quickly.\n\n131\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.298\nBecause there's really\ngenerally not a lot of\n\n132\n00:07:30.298 --> 00:07:35.310\ncomplex transformations happening\nto get this end result.\n\n133\n00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.546\nSo that's great, but\nthey do have their down sides on it.\n\n134\n00:07:39.546 --> 00:07:44.294\nAnd the big downside is\nif you encrypt something,\n\n135\n00:07:44.294 --> 00:07:48.363\nusing a symmetric system, I choose a key,\n\n136\n00:07:48.363 --> 00:07:53.110\nI have to figure out a way\nto get both that encrypted\n\n137\n00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.875\ncontent to whoever,\nas well as give them the key.\n\n138\n00:07:57.875 --> 00:08:02.875\nAnd so that presents some major,\nmajor, major problems there because\n\n139\n00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:07.510\nI can't send the key along with\nthe message, then game over.\n\n140\n00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.490\nHas to be alternate ways, or\nwhat they call out of bands.\n\n141\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.650\n>> Out of bands or out of channels.\n\n142\n00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:16.590\nYeah, cuz let's say I wanna send\nan encrypted email over to Sean and I do,\n\n143\n00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.800\nI use maybe a symmetric algorithm.\n\n144\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.840\nI encrypt it.\n\n145\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.150\nI send it over to Sean.\n\n146\n00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.734\nWell, I had to generate a key and\n\n147\n00:08:22.734 --> 00:08:25.840\nI used the key along with\nthat algorithm to encrypt it.\n\n148\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.352\nIf one of you guys intercepts\nthe message I sent to Sean and\n\n149\n00:08:29.352 --> 00:08:33.099\nthen I send the key in the same\nmanner I sent the email to Sean.\n\n150\n00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:34.875\nWell if you were able\nto intercept the email,\n\n151\n00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:38.400\nthere's a really good likelihood that\nyou're gonna intercept the key as well.\n\n152\n00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.960\nAnd that means you've got the encrypted\nemail as well as the key, and\n\n153\n00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.630\nnow you can read it.\n\n154\n00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.060\nSo key distribution, real challenge with\nthese symmetric encryption algorithms.\n\n155\n00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.170\n>> Yeah, it's a major,\nmajor issue with it.\n\n156\n00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:55.461\nAnd it's not just that, either, I could\neasily grab everyone in this building and\n\n157\n00:08:55.461 --> 00:08:59.328\nsay, okay, we're gonna encrypt\nmessages to one another.\n\n158\n00:08:59.328 --> 00:09:03.878\nAnd we could make it a point that every\nmorning, we meet in a conference room or\n\n159\n00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:07.938\nsomething here, and once I've made\nsure everyone's present no one\n\n160\n00:09:07.938 --> 00:09:11.305\nfrom the outside could see what\nwas going on in that room.\n\n161\n00:09:11.305 --> 00:09:15.220\nI could say, well, the key for today is,\nwhatever, and write it up there.\n\n162\n00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:20.200\nAnd then once everyone's got it written\ndown, I could erase it and then, done.\n\n163\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.650\nWe can do the same thing everyday,\n\n164\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.020\nso I could solve that problem\nof the key distribution.\n\n165\n00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.780\nBut that still doesn't take\ncare of the whole issue,\n\n166\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.520\nbecause one of the other things we\nhave with symmetric systems is,\n\n167\n00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.510\nwe have no way of doing\nnon-repudiation with that.\n\n168\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:41.217\nBecause in that scenario I\njust described there, well,\n\n169\n00:09:41.217 --> 00:09:46.030\nif anybody uses that key,\nwhich they're gonna be doing.\n\n170\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.426\nAnd they decide, well,\noops I said something stupid or\n\n171\n00:09:49.426 --> 00:09:53.403\ndid something stupid and\nI regret doing that, there's no way for\n\n172\n00:09:53.403 --> 00:09:59.060\nme to do non-repudiation and tie it back\nto that specific individual definitely.\n\n173\n00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.580\nSo, that's a huge thing.\n\n174\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.290\nYou could technically do it.\n\n175\n00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:08.349\nBut, there's a whole formula you can look\nup that shows you just how when you start\n\n176\n00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:13.650\nadding on more and more people and have to\ndistribute unique key pairs for everybody.\n\n177\n00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.630\nSay, okay, I'm gonna generate a key for\nyou, and you, and you.\n\n178\n00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.177\nAnd then people, to open a message from\nyou have to have that key, and then they,\n\n179\n00:10:20.177 --> 00:10:21.389\nyou have to have their key.\n\n180\n00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:24.240\nIt gets messy once you get\npast about ten people.\n\n181\n00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.330\nIt's obscene how many keys you gotta have.\n\n182\n00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.504\n>> So the overhead, or\n\n183\n00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:33.448\nthe work involved is not worth\nthe protection that we're getting.\n\n184\n00:10:33.448 --> 00:10:36.120\n>> Yeah,\nit becomes a management nightmare.\n\n185\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.260\nAnd even then,\nwhen you really get down to it,\n\n186\n00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.110\nif I'm distributing keys out to people,\nwell okay.\n\n187\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.390\nSo you're distributing the keys out to so\nand so.\n\n188\n00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.830\nAnd everyone gets their own personal key,\nbut\n\n189\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.900\nthen they also get copies\nof other people's keys.\n\n190\n00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.350\nHave you really solved\nthe problem of non-repudiation?\n\n191\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.200\nIf I've got you key, what's to stop\nme from using it and saying yeah,\n\n192\n00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.900\nthis is what Sean said about you.\n\n193\n00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.400\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n194\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.450\n>> It's like, scout's honor.\n\n195\n00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.090\nIt's like, I won't use it.\n\n196\n00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:08.530\nSo that's a big problem, but all things\nbeing said, though, there's still a use.\n\n197\n00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.740\nAnd they're used because they are very,\n\n198\n00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.900\nvery efficient at processing\nlarge volumes of data.\n\n199\n00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.940\nThat is a, no pun intended,\n\n200\n00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.980\na key to really understand\nwhere they're used a lot.\n\n201\n00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.676\nYou can pretty much guess once you\nknow a few points about, and really,\n\n202\n00:11:25.676 --> 00:11:30.372\nyou can really use that one point\nabout symmetric that it's very good at\n\n203\n00:11:30.372 --> 00:11:31.952\nprocessing bulk data.\n\n204\n00:11:31.952 --> 00:11:35.310\nYou can pretty much figure out the types\nof areas where it's gonna appear.\n\n205\n00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.483\nWhen you're transmitting\nlarge volumes of data,\n\n206\n00:11:37.483 --> 00:11:40.900\nwhen you're encrypting things like\na hard drive, stuff like that.\n\n207\n00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.140\nThey are going to be very,\nvery efficient at that.\n\n208\n00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:49.030\nBut for key management stuff, horrible,\nvery, very horrible at doing that.\n\n209\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.470\nWe have other systems that\nare much better at doing that, but\n\n210\n00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.594\nyou don't get something for nothing,\nyou do always pay for it somehow.\n\n211\n00:11:56.594 --> 00:12:01.559\nAnd so, that's something you've gotta be\nthinking about and we're gonna talk about.\n\n212\n00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:02.525\nSomeone did the math.\n\n213\n00:12:02.525 --> 00:12:03.256\nThere you go.\n\n214\n00:12:03.256 --> 00:12:08.123\n>> [LAUGH] Ben in the chatroom\nthrew up a little formula there,\n\n215\n00:12:08.123 --> 00:12:15.271\nn times n minus 1 times 10 to the 9th,\nit looks like, is what he's writing there,\n\n216\n00:12:15.271 --> 00:12:20.800\nbut anyway,\nis about 90 pairs of keys for 10 people.\n\n217\n00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.435\nAnd that's a lot.\n\n218\n00:12:21.435 --> 00:12:23.767\n[LAUGH]\n>> What just happened?\n\n219\n00:12:23.767 --> 00:12:24.962\nI fell asleep when I heard math.\n\n220\n00:12:24.962 --> 00:12:25.810\n>> Right?\n\n221\n00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.078\n[LAUGH] So you have symmetric then Sean,\n\n222\n00:12:28.078 --> 00:12:31.040\nyou say it's still used cuz\nit does have its place.\n\n223\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.740\nIt's really good at, it's very fast,\nit's very lightweight,\n\n224\n00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.550\ndoesn't take a lot of processing power.\n\n225\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.900\nAs you said, if I've got data transmitting\nacross the network, I need performance,\n\n226\n00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.290\nright, that is one of my\nprime concerns there.\n\n227\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.580\nOr if I'm doing an entire hard drive,\n\n228\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.813\nI want something that's gonna do it\nin a few hours, not in a few years.\n\n229\n00:12:48.813 --> 00:12:52.427\nSo, symmetric still has its place,\neven though it's been around forever and\n\n230\n00:12:52.427 --> 00:12:54.160\nit has some known weaknesses.\n\n231\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.407\nCuz there are ways, I know we're\ngonna talk about in future episodes,\n\n232\n00:12:56.407 --> 00:12:57.950\nwhere we can mitigate\nsome of those weaknesses.\n\n233\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.300\nWeaknesses, and\nstill use symmetric algorithms.\n\n234\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.610\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n235\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.211\nIn fact, that starts getting\nus towards the topic, and\n\n236\n00:13:06.211 --> 00:13:09.823\nwe could bring the term in\nnow of hybrid crypto systems.\n\n237\n00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:14.605\nWhich is, you can use these\nsystems by themselves, but\n\n238\n00:13:14.605 --> 00:13:19.020\nas one of the themes\nthat's been going on here.\n\n239\n00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.375\nIs we have situations where\nthe sum of the parts, or\n\n240\n00:13:22.375 --> 00:13:27.369\nthe parts put together are greater than\nany one of them would be if you just add\n\n241\n00:13:27.369 --> 00:13:29.257\nthem together on their own.\n\n242\n00:13:29.257 --> 00:13:33.792\nSo that's what you've gotta think about,\nis we can take symmetric, and\n\n243\n00:13:33.792 --> 00:13:36.582\nwe know symmetric's really, really good.\n\n244\n00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:41.216\nIt's the best in certain areas, but it,\nquite frankly, sucks in other ones, so\n\n245\n00:13:41.216 --> 00:13:45.651\nwe gotta find something that addresses\nthose areas that it's horrible at, so\n\n246\n00:13:45.651 --> 00:13:48.410\nthat's what we're building towards.\n\n247\n00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:54.770\nAnd I think, just to kind of make sure\nwe're really all on the same page here.\n\n248\n00:13:54.770 --> 00:14:00.830\nMaybe we'll take a moment here to kind\nof see what a simple symmetric system\n\n249\n00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:06.780\nlooks like, this is where I have\nup on my screen here, I have.\n\n250\n00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.950\nAnd this one,\n\n251\n00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.760\nsome of you may remember if you were\nin the cryptography course we did.\n\n252\n00:14:14.685 --> 00:14:15.645\nI showed this website.\n\n253\n00:14:15.645 --> 00:14:19.767\nIt's called The Black Chamber\nby Simon Singh, S-I-N-G-H.\n\n254\n00:14:19.767 --> 00:14:25.145\nYou can Google that and\nit's one of the results that will come up.\n\n255\n00:14:25.145 --> 00:14:27.110\nIt's the easiest way to find it.\n\n256\n00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.118\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz I'm too lazy to put that, the URL.\n\n257\n00:14:30.118 --> 00:14:32.262\n>> [LAUGH] I got you covered there Sean.\n\n258\n00:14:32.262 --> 00:14:34.582\n>> I'm not bookmarking it.\n\n259\n00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:38.612\nSo anyway, what I've got here is.\n\n260\n00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:44.192\nYou know what the Caesar cipher does.\n\n261\n00:14:44.192 --> 00:14:49.620\nSo you know it shifts stuff\na certain number of spaces.\n\n262\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.590\nWhat I have here is\nan example of the Caesar\n\n263\n00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:59.130\ncipher in the flesh.\n\n264\n00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.841\nWhat I can do here is I can type in,\nfor example, this is an offset,\n\n265\n00:15:03.841 --> 00:15:08.322\nif I type in an offset, and\nsay okay, my offset's gonna be 3.\n\n266\n00:15:08.322 --> 00:15:12.013\nYou can see that by putting the offset in,\nI have my plain text,\n\n267\n00:15:12.013 --> 00:15:16.920\nin the left-hand column there and I have\nmy cipher text in the right-hand column.\n\n268\n00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.340\nWhat that means is whatever's\nin the plain text column,\n\n269\n00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.310\nthat's the letter it's gonna\ntranslate over into on the back end.\n\n270\n00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:31.600\nSo, you can literally type\nin a message here and\n\n271\n00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.350\nsay cipher it and\nit gets that as your cipher text.\n\n272\n00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.320\nReally, really simple and easy.\n\n273\n00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.399\nThe way that works is by\nusing that specific key.\n\n274\n00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:48.283\nI can do a decipher same way, well, all I,\nit's already got the stuff filled in so\n\n275\n00:15:48.283 --> 00:15:51.951\nyou didn't see it, but\nif I clear the boxes here and\n\n276\n00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.820\nput in my cipher text,\nyou can see it goes right back.\n\n277\n00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.037\nI didn't change any of the settings.\n\n278\n00:15:58.037 --> 00:16:00.103\nOn those columns.\n\n279\n00:16:00.103 --> 00:16:01.763\nThe offset's still the same.\n\n280\n00:16:01.763 --> 00:16:08.302\nIf I didn't use that offset, this stuff\nhere would not come out the right way.\n\n281\n00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:14.220\nYou can very clearly see, if I was to go\nover here and say okay, well my offset.\n\n282\n00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:18.380\nIf I go back to the original\n18 it was when I came in here.\n\n283\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.890\nAnd plopped in this cipher text and\n\n284\n00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.640\nsaid decipher it, that's nothing.\n\n285\n00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.880\nSo, it doesn't mean anything so\nyou've got to find the correct key.\n\n286\n00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:39.710\nNow something like this,\nthe Ceasar cipher is a very simple one.\n\n287\n00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:44.130\nIt's very easy to follow and you could\nbreak this, you don't even need to have\n\n288\n00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:49.230\nany fancy equipment or anything, you just\ngot to be able to be patient enough.\n\n289\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.210\nJust, hey, I know it's in English and\n\n290\n00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.610\nI know there's only so\nmany possible settings and\n\n291\n00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.900\njust work your way through until you\nget something that's recognizable.\n\n292\n00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.200\nThat would be a very primitive and crude\nbrute force attack, but it would work.\n\n293\n00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.095\nSo, but nowadays with more modern systems,\nobviously, it wouldn't be that simple.\n\n294\n00:17:05.095 --> 00:17:06.845\nBut you can see that here.\n\n295\n00:17:06.845 --> 00:17:11.615\nAnd in fact, when we start talking about\ncrypt analysis and code breaking, when we\n\n296\n00:17:11.615 --> 00:17:17.770\nget to those areas, you can actually start\nreally figuring stuff out even faster.\n\n297\n00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:24.810\nBrute force, in a lot of circles, it's not\neven considered to be an attack, really.\n\n298\n00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.810\nBecause it's something where you\njust throw everything at it and\n\n299\n00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:29.960\nhope something sticks.\n\n300\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.700\nThere's no intelligence in it,\nit's very crude.\n\n301\n00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.370\nSome people that work in\ncryptoanalysis consider it.\n\n302\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.660\nWhen you start mixing in different rules\nand more intelligence into it, that's when\n\n303\n00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.590\nyou get into a real attack because you\nhave something actually working on it.\n\n304\n00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.512\nAnd we can change that\nfrom what have here.\n\n305\n00:17:51.512 --> 00:17:56.197\nWe could say, okay, well instead of\nthis being a simple cipher text.\n\n306\n00:17:56.197 --> 00:18:00.500\nInstead, we'll look at it from\nbeing simple just characters there.\n\n307\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.600\nWell, you can see some\nthings being repeated.\n\n308\n00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:09.340\nAnd you can see the O being repeated,\nand you see some other stuff in there.\n\n309\n00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.510\nJust from the O repeated,\nwe know there's a dot.\n\n310\n00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.455\nWe know the way the Ceasar cipher works.\n\n311\n00:18:13.455 --> 00:18:18.048\nWe know that they actually, when Ceasar\ncipher works, it translates every\n\n312\n00:18:18.048 --> 00:18:22.081\nletter by moving over certain\nnumber of spaces, use just one key.\n\n313\n00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:24.927\nSo that means that those\nletters have to be the same.\n\n314\n00:18:24.927 --> 00:18:26.817\nJust think about it, it's a double letter,\n\n315\n00:18:26.817 --> 00:18:29.323\nhow many double letters do we\nhave in the English language?\n\n316\n00:18:29.323 --> 00:18:34.140\nWe don't have that many cases\nwhere you have double letters.\n\n317\n00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:39.010\nYou can count those on almost two hands.\n\n318\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.660\nWe have double Ls, double Os.\n\n319\n00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.440\nStuff like that.\n\n320\n00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.540\nThere is not a ton.\n\n321\n00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.795\nAnd so you can just go through\nthose things and say, okay,\n\n322\n00:18:46.795 --> 00:18:51.245\ncould I convert those Os and any of those\ncombinations and if I use that same key to\n\n323\n00:18:51.245 --> 00:18:55.580\nswitch the other ones,\ndo I get something that's recognizable?\n\n324\n00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.444\nSo that's where you start to add something\na little more intelligent into it and\n\n325\n00:18:59.444 --> 00:19:01.070\nthey go even way beyond that too.\n\n326\n00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:06.463\nBut that's a story for\nanother time, but that's a simple,\n\n327\n00:19:06.463 --> 00:19:12.120\nthat's a very,\nvery simple symmetric algorithm.\n\n328\n00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.390\nNo real big secrets going on there.\n\n329\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.934\nAnd you can get more and more and\nmore complex with this, too.\n\n330\n00:19:20.934 --> 00:19:24.717\nYou can go off the deep end with it,\nif you want.\n\n331\n00:19:24.717 --> 00:19:26.120\nBut we don't need to.\n\n332\n00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.027\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n333\n00:19:27.027 --> 00:19:31.100\nyou could go way off the deep\nend if you wanted to with this.\n\n334\n00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.980\n>> So,\nCaesar's a good example of a symmetric\n\n335\n00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.280\nalgorithm that we've seen in the past.\n\n336\n00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.970\nWhat are some more modern\nday iterations of symmetric?\n\n337\n00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:44.190\n>> There's plenty actually on the menu for\nmodern day symmetric ones.\n\n338\n00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:49.120\nThe ones we see, are familiar with, we\nhave things like DES, the data encryption\n\n339\n00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:55.580\nstandard, which you really wouldn't want\nto use anymore, but it is still out there.\n\n340\n00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.060\nIt's not used anymore because it's\nconsidered to be a very weak system,\n\n341\n00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:03.210\nand it should be beyond being considered,\nI'm being nice there.\n\n342\n00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.103\nIt is a weaker crypto system.\n\n343\n00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:07.900\nSo it's not something that we\nuse in major practice any more.\n\n344\n00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:13.510\nBut we have things like Data Encryption\nStandard or DES, we have it's big brother,\n\n345\n00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:20.300\nTriple DES, or 3DES, which is just, it's\nmagnifying the power of the original one.\n\n346\n00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.790\nWe have AES, Advanced Encryption Standard.\n\n347\n00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:29.690\nYou have Reindahl as another one,\nthat's what AES came from.\n\n348\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.620\nYou've got plenty of them out there.\n\n349\n00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.910\nI've even got my list,\n\n350\n00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:37.060\njust to make sure I'm covering\nsome of the big names in this one.\n\n351\n00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.760\nIDEA, you don't hear about that\none as much, but it is out there.\n\n352\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.594\nThe International Data\nEncryption Algorithm,\n\n353\n00:20:43.594 --> 00:20:47.888\njust in case you really want to split\nhairs there and know what that means.\n\n354\n00:20:47.888 --> 00:20:50.901\nTypical just see IDEA and that's about it.\n\n355\n00:20:50.901 --> 00:20:57.040\nAnd then, you even have the family of\nRC ciphers, like RC4, RC5, those ones.\n\n356\n00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:02.350\nThose ones are pretty much all of\nthose with a couple exclusions\n\n357\n00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.370\nare symmetric algorithms as well.\n\n358\n00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.440\nIn fact, RC4 has come to a lot of\npeople's attention because it's\n\n359\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.590\nthe one they use in web.\n\n360\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.480\nAnd it's actually a pretty\ndecent system on its own, but\n\n361\n00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:19.770\nit was implemented very poorly by\nengineers and the rest is history on that.\n\n362\n00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.980\nIf you've gone through any of the ethical\nhacking stuff for other things, it's very,\n\n363\n00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.880\nvery easy to crack, so\nthat's where it's got its notoriety from.\n\n364\n00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:34.759\nBut all of these, they do have things that\nmake them unique within that field and\n\n365\n00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:37.760\nthere's plenty more beyond even this.\n\n366\n00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.008\nThese tend to be some of the bigger ones.\n\n367\n00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:43.559\nThere are a whole bunch of other\nones outside this that are done for\n\n368\n00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:44.916\nexperimental reasons or\n\n369\n00:21:44.916 --> 00:21:48.936\nones that may have been cast aside\nbecause they were audited and checked.\n\n370\n00:21:48.936 --> 00:21:53.912\nAnd they just were weak when\nthey were really scrutinized.\n\n371\n00:21:53.912 --> 00:21:57.323\nBut these tend to be the ones\nthat you do see in major use.\n\n372\n00:21:57.323 --> 00:22:01.030\nIf you're gonna run into any of them,\nit's probably gonna be Triple DES and AES.\n\n373\n00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.230\nThose are the big players in there.\n\n374\n00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.620\nBut they all obey that same thing, and\n\n375\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:12.150\nas the key that's used on the front end\nis used on the back end, and vice versa.\n\n376\n00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:18.240\nVery fast at doing bulk data and\ndo their job, do it very well.\n\n377\n00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.000\nThey may have different key sizes and\nkey spaces and stuff like that but\n\n378\n00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.310\nthey're still operating on\nthe same basic principle of,\n\n379\n00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:29.280\nwe've got the same key\nbeing used on both sides.\n\n380\n00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.260\nAnd think about it,\nby the way, everyone in here,\n\n381\n00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:39.040\neveryone viewing this has presumably\ngot some background in IT.\n\n382\n00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.800\nWhen you're looking at this, you're\nlooking and going through stuff in IT and\n\n383\n00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.840\nstart to think back to it.\n\n384\n00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.940\nThink of where you've seen.\n\n385\n00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.899\nI'm pretty sure no one here is gonna say,\noh, Triple DES and AES,\n\n386\n00:22:49.899 --> 00:22:51.826\nI've never seen those before.\n\n387\n00:22:51.826 --> 00:22:52.535\nWrite those down.\n\n388\n00:22:52.535 --> 00:22:55.670\nNo, there could be someone.\n\n389\n00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.805\nBut, more than likely you've run\ninto those already at some point,\n\n390\n00:22:58.805 --> 00:23:00.927\nthink about the places\nyou've run into them.\n\n391\n00:23:00.927 --> 00:23:05.105\nYou've run into places like IPsec.\n\n392\n00:23:05.105 --> 00:23:07.560\nThink about what IPsec does.\n\n393\n00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.160\nIt's encrypting data as it\nflows over the network.\n\n394\n00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.640\nSo bulk data, so boom.\n\n395\n00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.870\nThat's why it's there.\n\n396\n00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.370\nYou look at things like wireless networks.\n\n397\n00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:23.660\nWireless networks, AES and Triple DES\nare plastered all over those all the time.\n\n398\n00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.891\nSo that's just yet\nanother case where they pop up, and\n\n399\n00:23:26.891 --> 00:23:29.991\nwe definitely fit the criteria\nof having bulk data.\n\n400\n00:23:29.991 --> 00:23:32.997\nSo, and then you can start throwing\nin stuff like SSL and TLS and\n\n401\n00:23:32.997 --> 00:23:36.483\nall of this sorts of stuff and\nyou'll see symmetrics all over the place.\n\n402\n00:23:36.483 --> 00:23:40.731\nBecause of that requirement\nto process bulk data,\n\n403\n00:23:40.731 --> 00:23:44.401\nto do it very efficiently and\nvery quickly.\n\n404\n00:23:44.401 --> 00:23:49.175\nOnce you know how symmetric works,\nyou can pretty much guess\n\n405\n00:23:49.175 --> 00:23:53.479\nif I asked you Knowing that\nthey're good at both data,\n\n406\n00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:58.930\nif you know IPsec or TLS or\nany of these things while at work.\n\n407\n00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:03.420\nOnce you know that, know what they're good\nat, I can tell you hey what encryption\n\n408\n00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:09.370\nalgorithms use IPsec, which one's\nwould be used with with wireless.\n\n409\n00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:13.150\nYou'd be like it has to be something like\nthis, I don't know which algorithm yet but\n\n410\n00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.120\nI know it has to be something in that\ncategory more than likely because anything\n\n411\n00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.420\nelse would just not be able to carry\nout that job as efficiently or\n\n412\n00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.530\neven the right way.\n\n413\n00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:23.290\n>> For this exam,\n\n414\n00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.680\nwe don't need to understand how each\nof these algorithms work, right?\n\n415\n00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.500\nIt's more about knowing\nthat these are symmetrisc.\n\n416\n00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.370\nSo if they tell you which one of these are\nsymmetric or you need a solution that uses\n\n417\n00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:37.130\nsymmetric algorithms you can\npick this one out of the list?\n\n418\n00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.010\n>> Yes I would definitely be able\nto do that before you sit the exam.\n\n419\n00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:46.680\nQuite honestly it's not going\nto hurt you if you take the time\n\n420\n00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.940\nto look at the different key lengths and\nif they're a block or a stream.\n\n421\n00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.010\nThose will also get you a long way.\n\n422\n00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.730\nSo you might as well, if you're memorizing\nthese, grab that information too,\n\n423\n00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.700\nbecause it's going to pay dividends for\nyou just in general.\n\n424\n00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.630\nIt's just going to be\nvaluable information.\n\n425\n00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:08.740\nEspecially if you're going to decide to go\nup to something like the CSSP afterwards.\n\n426\n00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.400\nCSSP and ISC has that one.\n\n427\n00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.900\nThey're not going to cut you any slack,\nthey expect you to know that.\n\n428\n00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.640\nSo you might as well get it in your head,\nand\n\n429\n00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.925\nthen if you're going to\nbe doing ethical hacking,\n\n430\n00:25:19.925 --> 00:25:23.860\npen testing, you know forensics anything\nlike that, you need to know it there too.\n\n431\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.730\nSo be very prepared.\n\n432\n00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:30.680\nAnd if you're a lawyer and\nyou're dealing with IT,\n\n433\n00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.310\nyou can leave, no And honestly,\nyou will need to know it there.\n\n434\n00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.780\nThat's huge.\n\n435\n00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.680\nIf you are working for a company or\na lawyer, and you are interpreting stuff\n\n436\n00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.870\nlike HIPAA guidelines and other regulatory\nguidelines, and they require encryption,\n\n437\n00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:52.525\nthey're typically not going to\nsay hey use encryption, why?\n\n438\n00:25:52.525 --> 00:25:53.270\nWhat does that mean?\n\n439\n00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.345\n>> [LAUGH] Talk about the Caesar cipher\nthat should satisfy HIPAA right?\n\n440\n00:25:56.345 --> 00:25:58.360\n>> Yeah that sounds good enough.\n\n441\n00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.025\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's going to be something a little\n\n442\n00:26:01.025 --> 00:26:04.395\nmore specific, so\nyou need to be able to look for\n\n443\n00:26:04.395 --> 00:26:06.795\nthose things and have them in your head.\n\n444\n00:26:08.005 --> 00:26:10.785\nI'll tell you just from my\nown personal experience,\n\n445\n00:26:10.785 --> 00:26:15.880\nI've bind solutions from third parties and\nstuff like that.\n\n446\n00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.810\nSales people a lot of times\ndon't even understand\n\n447\n00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.300\nencryption when they\nare selling something to you.\n\n448\n00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:25.280\nThey will make big claims on how\nstrong the crypto system is and\n\n449\n00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.460\nhow secure their product is.\n\n450\n00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.279\nThey will throw out a number and\nsmile, saying, yeah it uses this.\n\n451\n00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.420\nOkay, you're done.\n\n452\n00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.620\nI had someone tell me one time\nthat they're using this thing,\n\n453\n00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:43.000\nthis was only like about eight years ago,\ntelling me that their product was using\n\n454\n00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.830\nstate of the art 56 bit encryption.\n\n455\n00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.490\nState of the art when, 73, 74.\n\n456\n00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:57.540\nYou know, it was just something\nthat should have never been said.\n\n457\n00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:04.130\nI'm glad it was said, because I knew\nto advise [laughter] the person.\n\n458\n00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:04.970\n>> Just don't.\n\n459\n00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:05.945\n>> Be prepared for that.\n\n460\n00:27:05.945 --> 00:27:07.205\n>> All right, good.\n\n461\n00:27:07.205 --> 00:27:08.995\nAll right.\nA lot of great information on\n\n462\n00:27:08.995 --> 00:27:10.245\nSymmetric Algorithm.\n\n463\n00:27:10.245 --> 00:27:13.225\nSean, you gave us a good\noverview of how symmetric,\n\n464\n00:27:13.225 --> 00:27:16.185\nyou know what makes an encryption\nsymmetric, how it works.\n\n465\n00:27:16.185 --> 00:27:19.527\nAnd then a great list of symmetric\nalgorithms that we need to\n\n466\n00:27:19.527 --> 00:27:20.477\nbe familiar with.\n\n467\n00:27:20.477 --> 00:27:25.577\nSo anything else we want to throw in\non our symmetric encryption episode?\n\n468\n00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:30.837\n>> I'll just reiterate something\nthat was said in a previous section.\n\n469\n00:27:30.837 --> 00:27:34.950\nWe talked about terms is this\nis again one of those areas\n\n470\n00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.100\nthat you should make your flashcards.\n\n471\n00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.200\nIt's going to reap big dividends for you.\n\n472\n00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:49.840\nI'm never one to say, hey, just I'm\nteaching to just what's on the exam.\n\n473\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:55.310\nI never do that, for me it sounds\nweird but I don't care about the exam\n\n474\n00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:58.930\nas much as I care about making sure you've\ngot the knowledge and can work with it.\n\n475\n00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.430\nEverything I give you will\nhelp you pass the exam, but\n\n476\n00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.650\nit's also going to make you effective\nas someone out in the field too.\n\n477\n00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.680\nSo this is one of those\nthings where I'm telling you,\n\n478\n00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.590\nmake those flash cards,\nand memorize those things.\n\n479\n00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:13.400\nBecause it not only will\nhelp you pass that test, but\n\n480\n00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.730\nit's also going to make you very\nknowledgeable when you're going through,\n\n481\n00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.360\nanalyzing, selecting products,\nhaving discussions on it.\n\n482\n00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.940\nIt's going to help you out,\nlike I said, tremendously.\n\n483\n00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.270\n>> Good, all right ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's going to do it for this episode.\n\n484\n00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.760\nHope you enjoyed watching.\n\n485\n00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.970\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n486\n00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.050\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n487\n00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.805\n>>

00:00:16.420\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and with me\ntoday is none other than Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.650\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.995\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:20.340\n>> Doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.110\nWe are continuing on with our CASP series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.190\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at asymmetric encryption.\n\n9\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.470\nNow we've already taken a look at\nencryption in general, defined some\n\n10\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.820\nkey terms, and we talked about something\nlike symmetric encryption algorithms.\n\n11\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.313\nNow we wanna look at asymmetric\nencryption algorithms, Sean.\n\n12\n00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:39.410\nAnd what's the big difference here?\n\n13\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.964\nWhat's asymmetric all about?\n\n14\n00:00:40.964 --> 00:00:46.300\n>> Well asymmetric, and this is\nreally the best way to understand it,\n\n15\n00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.830\nis if you compare and\ncontrast it with symmetric.\n\n16\n00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.800\nAnd that way just gives you a much better\nunderstanding of why one versus the other,\n\n17\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.700\nadvantages of one over the other, and\nyou can really get a good grasp on it.\n\n18\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.530\nSo that's the approach that we're gonna\nkinda follow, is we're gonna talk about\n\n19\n00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.390\nasymmetric, but then we're also gonna\nkinda bring in symmetric just a bit.\n\n20\n00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.192\nThis is not the place\nwe're gonna go through and\n\n21\n00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:15.443\nrehash all the details of symmetric.\n\n22\n00:01:15.443 --> 00:01:19.865\nBut we're gonna use it just as something\nto kinda show you what the differences\n\n23\n00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:22.150\nare and why we'd use one over the other.\n\n24\n00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:29.600\nBecause that's a big sticking point, is\nthey do not both do the same things well.\n\n25\n00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.470\nThey're almost complete opposites from one\nanother as far as what they do well and\n\n26\n00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.070\nwhat they don't do so well.\n\n27\n00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.206\nSo that's kind of where we're\ncoming at from that one.\n\n28\n00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:44.977\nSo getting down to the core question here,\nwhat is asymmetric?\n\n29\n00:01:44.977 --> 00:01:49.387\nWell if we look at asymmetric,\nif you recall,\n\n30\n00:01:49.387 --> 00:01:57.090\nsymmetric systems had a algorithm that\nused one key to both encrypt and decrypt.\n\n31\n00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.010\nYou had to use the same key on both\nsides to make the process work.\n\n32\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.392\nWe use the Caesar cipher as an example,\nand I plugged it into our web page.\n\n33\n00:02:10.392 --> 00:02:12.961\nAnd we saw that if you\nuse three to go one way,\n\n34\n00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:17.013\nyou're gonna use three to go\nthe other way, it's plain and simple.\n\n35\n00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:19.125\nAsymmetric doesn't play by those rules.\n\n36\n00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:22.108\nAsymmetric uses what's called a key pair.\n\n37\n00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:28.844\nAnd when you enroll in the system,\nyou have a key pair generated for\n\n38\n00:02:28.844 --> 00:02:33.175\nyou that are mathematically related, but\n\n39\n00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:38.606\nyou don't have to have them\nboth in your possession.\n\n40\n00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:42.995\nYou could have one or the other, and\nyou can verify that someone is in\n\n41\n00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:47.090\npossession of the other,\nwhich is a really cool thing with it.\n\n42\n00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.290\nNow, when you using an asymmetric system,\nif you are gonna use something,\n\n43\n00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.430\nlet's just say we're gonna modify\nour Caesar cypher example, and\n\n44\n00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.510\nwe're gonna say that that's\nnot symmetric anymore.\n\n45\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.870\nI mean, it is symmetric in the real world,\nbut for right now we're just gonna say no,\n\n46\n00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.510\nit's not a symmetric algorithm.\n\n47\n00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.720\nSo what would be the difference if\nit was in the world of asymmetric?\n\n48\n00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.280\nWhat would happen is,\nis that you would have a key,\n\n49\n00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.820\nlet's say of three to go\ninto the encryption process.\n\n50\n00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.377\nBut if you want to decrypt it,\nyour key would be 13 or 17 or something.\n\n51\n00:03:22.377 --> 00:03:23.993\n>> Something other than three.\n\n52\n00:03:23.993 --> 00:03:25.536\n>> Yeah, something other than three.\n\n53\n00:03:25.536 --> 00:03:29.773\nAnd that really messes with\npeople's heads when they hear that.\n\n54\n00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:31.864\nIt's like well, that doesn't make sense.\n\n55\n00:03:31.864 --> 00:03:36.104\nIt's like, if you do this number of\nspaces this way, how could you do more or\n\n56\n00:03:36.104 --> 00:03:40.234\nless spaces the other way but not\nthe exact one, and get the right result?\n\n57\n00:03:40.234 --> 00:03:44.969\nWell, we ain't even gonna worry\nabout the mathematics of that.\n\n58\n00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:46.874\n>> [LAUGH] I thought you were gonna\nsit here and explain it to us.\n\n59\n00:03:46.874 --> 00:03:49.010\n>> Yeah hold on,\nI'm just gonna draw some stuff out here.\n\n60\n00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.387\nYou know what we should\ndo on the recording,\n\n61\n00:03:52.387 --> 00:03:56.236\nwe should do like little\nrainbow squiggly lines.\n\n62\n00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like part of the tape got edited out.\n\n63\n00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.102\nIt's like, oh, has everyone got that?\n\n64\n00:03:59.102 --> 00:04:00.204\nOkay, cuz I'm not doing it again.\n\n65\n00:04:00.204 --> 00:04:00.901\n>> Yeah.\n\n66\n00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:03.341\n[LAUGH]\n>> I could never do that again,\n\n67\n00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:04.441\nit was awesome.\n\n68\n00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:06.310\n>> But it is an odd system to think about,\nright?\n\n69\n00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.039\nIt'd be like saying okay,\nI've got two keys for my house, and\n\n70\n00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.885\nthis key is what I use when I leave\nthe house to lock the front door.\n\n71\n00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:14.794\nBut then when I get back,\nI can't use that key, right.\n\n72\n00:04:14.794 --> 00:04:17.720\nI've got to get the other key\nout to unlock the front door.\n\n73\n00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.320\n>> Yeah, it's pretty trippy\nwhen you look at it because\n\n74\n00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.780\neverything tells us from a common sense\nperspective that that shouldn't work.\n\n75\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.800\nBut it does work.\n\n76\n00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.842\nThey actually came up with\nthe formulas for this in the,\n\n77\n00:04:33.842 --> 00:04:36.688\nwell they've been around for awhile.\n\n78\n00:04:36.688 --> 00:04:41.809\nThey actually had a workable, were able to\ndo something with this in about the 70s.\n\n79\n00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:46.482\nIt took quite a while, and what made\nthat happen is they had computing\n\n80\n00:04:46.482 --> 00:04:50.512\npower that was now actually able\nto solve those problems and\n\n81\n00:04:50.512 --> 00:04:53.590\nmathematics in a reasonable\namount of time.\n\n82\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.270\nThey were just something that\nwas completely undoable, or\n\n83\n00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.620\njust completely unfeasible to do with\njust human hands, to use that term.\n\n84\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.792\nWhen computing power really\nkinda came out of where it was,\n\n85\n00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:11.889\nI guess in the Dark Ages, or didn't exist.\n\n86\n00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.389\nIt really became possible\nto do this stuff, and so\n\n87\n00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.422\nthat's where they came into their own.\n\n88\n00:05:16.422 --> 00:05:20.923\nThe formulas were now able to\nbe processed in a reasonable\n\n89\n00:05:20.923 --> 00:05:23.960\namount of time to make it usable.\n\n90\n00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.432\nAnd so, that's why we've seen\nthis explosion of things that use\n\n91\n00:05:28.432 --> 00:05:33.152\nasymmetric algorithms because they\noffer some tremendous benefits\n\n92\n00:05:33.152 --> 00:05:37.300\nthat symmetric just plain and\nsimple doesn't offer.\n\n93\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.640\nNow, you can use symmetric to do\nthings like encryption and decryption,\n\n94\n00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.321\nand they are used to do that.\n\n95\n00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:48.196\nBut it's important to know that\nyou're not gonna use them in\n\n96\n00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:52.890\nthe same situations that you\nwould use symmetric ones in.\n\n97\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.460\nNow remember that little\ndetail we said with symmetric.\n\n98\n00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.270\nWe said symmetric is good\nat processing bulk data.\n\n99\n00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.699\nWe said it just cruises right through,\nman, it just does it.\n\n100\n00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.905\nAsymmetric can do the same thing,\nbut it's orders of magnitude slower.\n\n101\n00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:16.970\nI mean,\nyou could be talking 1,000 times slower to\n\n102\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.115\nprocess the same data with\nasymmetric over symmetric.\n\n103\n00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:24.035\nI mean, that's a huge difference.\n\n104\n00:06:24.035 --> 00:06:25.196\n>> Wow, it is.\n\n105\n00:06:25.196 --> 00:06:28.405\n>> And if you're talking a bulk\namount of data, you're gonna notice.\n\n106\n00:06:28.405 --> 00:06:31.155\n>> Like an entire hard drive or-\n>> Oh yeah, definitely.\n\n107\n00:06:31.155 --> 00:06:34.635\nIf you were gonna do a whole hard drive,\nyeah, you would definitely see that.\n\n108\n00:06:34.635 --> 00:06:37.015\nThat's just not something that is going\nto happen in the blink of an eye.\n\n109\n00:06:37.015 --> 00:06:41.555\nIt's something that's,\nyou better go do something else for\n\n110\n00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:44.380\nlike the next couple of years\nbecause it's gonna be a while.\n\n111\n00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.340\nSo it's not really practical for that.\n\n112\n00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.170\nAnd it's because of the high order\nmathematics and factorization and\n\n113\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.770\nall that's involved that it takes so\nlong to do that stuff.\n\n114\n00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.140\nComputers are obviously very good at math.\n\n115\n00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.244\nBut there's still things\nin math that the computers,\n\n116\n00:07:02.244 --> 00:07:07.044\nwhile they can solve them much faster than\nwe could, are still gonna be bogged down.\n\n117\n00:07:07.044 --> 00:07:11.430\nAnd if you keep putting more and more\nstuff on it, it really gets bogged down.\n\n118\n00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.076\nSo bulk data's a big no-no for this.\n\n119\n00:07:14.076 --> 00:07:16.864\nYou're gonna pay the price for it.\n\n120\n00:07:16.864 --> 00:07:23.220\nSmall pieces of data, not a big deal, and\nso we'll talk about where that comes in.\n\n121\n00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.854\nBut then things that, once we know\nthat doesn't do encryption on large\n\n122\n00:07:27.854 --> 00:07:31.728\namounts of data all that well,\nwell, what does it do well?\n\n123\n00:07:31.728 --> 00:07:37.296\nWell, all those things that you recall\nthat symmetric didn't do well as far\n\n124\n00:07:37.296 --> 00:07:41.104\nas keys and authentication- [CROSSTALK]\n>> We're talking about like\n\n125\n00:07:41.104 --> 00:07:43.029\nkey distribution and non-repudiation-\n>> All those things, yeah.\n\n126\n00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.912\n>> Were the big ones I remember.\n\n127\n00:07:43.912 --> 00:07:48.306\n>> Yeah, all those things with key\ndistribution, non-repudiation,\n\n128\n00:07:48.306 --> 00:07:53.381\nall that type of stuff that you just can't\nget with symmetric easily or if at all.\n\n129\n00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:56.818\nAll those things are doable\nquite easily with asymmetric.\n\n130\n00:07:56.818 --> 00:08:01.601\nI want you to have a key, or\nI want to do non-repudiation with it.\n\n131\n00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:05.176\nI just generate a key pair and\ntake one of those keys.\n\n132\n00:08:05.176 --> 00:08:08.419\nAnd put it someplace where\neveryone can access it, and\n\n133\n00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:10.050\nthe other key I give to you.\n\n134\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.060\nAnd you're the only one\nthat has access to it.\n\n135\n00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.910\nSo anything you do with that key since\nyou're the only that has access to it,\n\n136\n00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.860\nif I could take your public key,\nis what they call that.\n\n137\n00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.020\nThere's a public and a private.\n\n138\n00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.410\nThe private, you have access to only and\nthe public, everyone else has access to.\n\n139\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:30.490\nIf you take that public key and\ncan verify something that you did using\n\n140\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:35.910\nthe private key if I can reverse\nthat operation then I know it's you.\n\n141\n00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.490\nI don't even have to see your private key.\n\n142\n00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.730\nThat's really neat.\n\n143\n00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.470\nWhat you're getting there is\nsomething that they like to call\n\n144\n00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.860\na zero knowledge proof is that\nwithout actually seeing that key,\n\n145\n00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.590\nI know you're in possession of it and\ndone.\n\n146\n00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.455\nSo that solves the key distribution thing.\n\n147\n00:08:52.455 --> 00:08:56.517\nSolves the nonrepudiation thing cuz if you\nused your private key to do something and\n\n148\n00:08:56.517 --> 00:08:59.373\nI can reverse that operation in public,\nI know you did it.\n\n149\n00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:03.130\nIf you deny it, you're a liar or\nsomething else is going on.\n\n150\n00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.445\nSo you get to pick.\n\n151\n00:09:04.445 --> 00:09:05.620\n>> Somebody gave somebody your password.\n\n152\n00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:09.480\n>> Yeah, you did something stupid or\nyou're just lying.\n\n153\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.170\n>> So the fact that we got two keys and\nthey're mathematically related.\n\n154\n00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.390\nAnd they're used at different parts or\ndifferent times within there gives\n\n155\n00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.940\nus the ability to do that, to provide\nthat nonrepudiation that we needed.\n\n156\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.210\nIn fact, we don't have to\ndistribute the keys anymore.\n\n157\n00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.020\nLike you said, one of the keys is public.\n\n158\n00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.060\nI'd give it to everybody.\n\n159\n00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.510\nI don't care who intercepts it.\n\n160\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.221\nThey can have it.\n\n161\n00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:30.947\nI'll give it to them,\nthey don't have to try to intercept it.\n\n162\n00:09:30.947 --> 00:09:32.080\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n163\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.810\nThat's the beauty of this system.\n\n164\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.750\nAnd something else to mention with this,\n\n165\n00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.060\nif I haven't made it clear already, is\nthat if you have either one of those keys,\n\n166\n00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.380\nyou can't tell what\nthe other one looks like.\n\n167\n00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.440\nThat doesn't exist there,\nthey're mirror copies of one another.\n\n168\n00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.780\nThat's sometimes the way they explain it.\n\n169\n00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.640\nBut mirror kind of assumes that oh well,\nit's just a reverse of the other one.\n\n170\n00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.518\nNot that simple.\n\n171\n00:09:59.518 --> 00:10:05.870\nThere's a linkage between the two, but\nit's not something that you can pick up.\n\n172\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.665\n>> If I grab your public key,\nI can't take that key and\n\n173\n00:10:08.665 --> 00:10:12.311\ntry to reverse engineer it and\nfigure out what your private key is.\n\n174\n00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:14.528\n>> Yeah, it won't work,\nit just will not work.\n\n175\n00:10:14.528 --> 00:10:15.190\n>> Nice.\n\n176\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.107\n>> As far as operationally,\n\n177\n00:10:17.107 --> 00:10:22.258\nyou can use either key to do\ninitiate any operation you want.\n\n178\n00:10:22.258 --> 00:10:23.690\nWith the understanding,\n\n179\n00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:28.500\nthat whatever you do with one key can\nonly be reversed with the other one.\n\n180\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.440\nThat's the rule, so you can't take\nthe public key and do something with it,\n\n181\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.950\nand then reverse the exact same\noperation with that public key.\n\n182\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.100\nIt won't work.\n\n183\n00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.350\nYou initiate the operation with\nthe public, you gotta go private.\n\n184\n00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.900\nYou just start with the private,\nyou gotta go with the public one.\n\n185\n00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.740\nThat's a rule that you're not gonna\nbreak in any way, shape or form.\n\n186\n00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.260\n>> Neither one of them can do the\nencryption, for example, but whichever one\n\n187\n00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.030\nyou use to encrypt, you have to have the\nother half of the key pair to decrypt it.\n\n188\n00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.228\n>> Exactly.\n\n189\n00:10:57.228 --> 00:11:02.815\nAnd as far as the keys go, you could\nsay take into account all the stuff I\n\n190\n00:11:02.815 --> 00:11:08.407\nsaid that they're mirrors of one another,\nand they're paired up and\n\n191\n00:11:08.407 --> 00:11:13.553\nyou can't tell what one looks like\njust by having the other one.\n\n192\n00:11:13.553 --> 00:11:17.028\nHaving taken all those\nthings into account,\n\n193\n00:11:17.028 --> 00:11:21.418\nwe need to consider the fact\nthat what makes one public and\n\n194\n00:11:21.418 --> 00:11:27.380\nmakes one private is just which one I\ncall public and which one I call private.\n\n195\n00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.700\nThere's nothing special about it saying,\noh, there's a key pair,\n\n196\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.640\nthis one clearly is the public and\nno, it doesn't have to be the public.\n\n197\n00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.500\nWhatever you call it and\nwho you give it to.\n\n198\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.060\nIf I generate a key pair, I take this key\nand say hey, you hold on to this and don't\n\n199\n00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.220\ntell anyone what it looks like, don't show\nit to anyone, don't lose any of that.\n\n200\n00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.400\nThat's a private key by definition.\n\n201\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.090\n>> Mm, okay.\n\n202\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.778\n>> That's it.\n>> So it's not predetermined then?\n\n203\n00:11:49.778 --> 00:11:51.920\n>> Yeah,\nthere's no predetermination there.\n\n204\n00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.190\nThat's the private key.\n\n205\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.370\nI gave it to you and said that's yours.\n\n206\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.258\nKeep it secret,\nkeep it safe, and that's it.\n\n207\n00:11:58.258 --> 00:11:58.838\nDone.\n\n208\n00:11:58.838 --> 00:11:59.620\n>> Nice.\n\n209\n00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.630\n>> So it's an important detail.\n\n210\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.852\n>> So asymmetric can pick up the pace\na little bit and do a little better with\n\n211\n00:12:04.852 --> 00:12:07.555\nbulk amounts of data, sounds like it\nwould be our solution for everything.\n\n212\n00:12:07.555 --> 00:12:11.315\n>> Yeah, it does sound like\nthat when you look at it,\n\n213\n00:12:11.315 --> 00:12:14.985\nit just seems like such a great and\nelegant system and\n\n214\n00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:19.395\naddresses the problems that symmetric does\nbut that performance thing is the kicker.\n\n215\n00:12:19.395 --> 00:12:22.005\nIt just takes out of contention there.\n\n216\n00:12:22.005 --> 00:12:24.015\nIt doesn't mean we don't use it for\nencryption,\n\n217\n00:12:24.015 --> 00:12:27.905\nit just means we have to use it\nin the appropriate situation.\n\n218\n00:12:27.905 --> 00:12:31.415\nIf you are encrypting a very\nsmall amount of data,\n\n219\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.040\nthat lag is still there but\nit's not really noticeable.\n\n220\n00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.200\nIt's when you start shoving\na bunch of stuff at that algorithm\n\n221\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.725\nthat it's gonna be\na noticeable slowdown with it.\n\n222\n00:12:45.725 --> 00:12:49.175\nSo that's the important detail with this.\n\n223\n00:12:49.175 --> 00:12:55.305\nDon't think that you don't use asymmetric\nto encrypt, you do use it to encrypt but\n\n224\n00:12:55.305 --> 00:13:01.575\nwe used to encrypt very small things,\nand you've already kind of got an idea.\n\n225\n00:13:01.575 --> 00:13:07.165\nYou've got the tools right now to really\nkind of understand where we would use it.\n\n226\n00:13:07.165 --> 00:13:13.250\nIf we needed to encrypt something really\nsmall and need to address a problem.\n\n227\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.605\nI mentioned hybrid cryptosystem.\n\n228\n00:13:15.605 --> 00:13:20.160\nA hybrid cryptosystem combines\nthe different parts or\n\n229\n00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.800\ndifferent system to make\nsomething that's stronger.\n\n230\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.730\nAnd fits together in such a way that it\naddresses the problems that other systems\n\n231\n00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.550\nhave and strengthens them or whatever,\nenhances them, giving you that.\n\n232\n00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.130\nWe looked at symmetric,\nall the stuff we talk about symmetric,\n\n233\n00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.510\nyou know we mentioned key\ndistributions a big problem.\n\n234\n00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.290\nWe have to figure out\na way to get that key and\n\n235\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.830\nthat data without someone else getting it.\n\n236\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:45.080\n>> If I just had a way to protect\nthat key with something, hm.\n\n237\n00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.350\n>> There you go, that's it right there.\n\n238\n00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.779\nWhat are we gonna protect it with?\n\n239\n00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.535\nAn asymmetric system.\n\n240\n00:13:52.535 --> 00:13:57.856\nKey's very small, so boom,\njust run that through\n\n241\n00:13:57.856 --> 00:14:02.050\nour asymmetric system of choice,\nwe encrypt the key, and we're done.\n\n242\n00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.490\n>> So now we've solved it all.\n\n243\n00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.360\nWe've got the symmetric\nencryption algorithm we use to do\n\n244\n00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.900\nthe bulk of the work, and do all\nthe hard stuff cuz it's really quick.\n\n245\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.400\nAnd we just use the asymmetric encryption\nto protect the key we need with\n\n246\n00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.290\nthe symmetric encryption.\n\n247\n00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.989\nSo the asymmetric is doing\na very little bit of work.\n\n248\n00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:20.632\nBut it's giving us all those\nbenefits of non-repudiation and\n\n249\n00:14:20.632 --> 00:14:22.770\nprotecting that key distribution.\n\n250\n00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:28.560\n>> Yep, it's really kind of understanding\nhow these things fit together.\n\n251\n00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.040\nAnd how they can provide\nyou a good solution.\n\n252\n00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.310\nAnd we're not even done yet, we've\ngot another form of a cryptosystem to\n\n253\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:41.650\ntalk about, but this is just\nthese two have already addressed,\n\n254\n00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.830\nkind of complimented each other\npretty well to address the problem.\n\n255\n00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:50.030\nThat wouldn't be able to be solved as\neasily if we didn't have these available.\n\n256\n00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.470\nSo that's significant.\n\n257\n00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:58.180\nSo asymmetric big, big, big deal but\nyeah, it does take some serious computing\n\n258\n00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:03.418\npower and that's why they're limited\nto certain areas and certain functions.\n\n259\n00:15:03.418 --> 00:15:07.350\n>> That's fascinating, too, that you say\nthere was actually asymmetricals around\n\n260\n00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.210\na lot longer than when\nwe've actually used it.\n\n261\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.700\nBecause we knew what we could\ndo to protect this stuff.\n\n262\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.430\nWe didn't have the power to do it.\n\n263\n00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.090\nSo it's like the technology\nhad to catch up with\n\n264\n00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.250\nthe ideas that these people had when\nthey were generating these algorithms.\n\n265\n00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:25.060\n>> Yeah the theory was out there and\nthe papers were out there,\n\n266\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.780\nand they just did not have\nan effective way of doing it.\n\n267\n00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.460\nIt's kind of interesting when\nyou look at it, just how much\n\n268\n00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:37.240\ncomputing power can make the difference\nbetween something that is theoretical and\n\n269\n00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.130\nsomething that's actually practical to do.\n\n270\n00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.166\nThis is just one of\nthe many cases is that hey,\n\n271\n00:15:45.166 --> 00:15:49.400\npeople that have written papers go,\nwouldn't it be great if we could do this?\n\n272\n00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.362\nThere's no practical way to do it.\n\n273\n00:15:54.362 --> 00:15:57.812\nThere is no really efficient way to do it\nso they had to wait until the computing\n\n274\n00:15:57.812 --> 00:16:00.998\npower came along, remember hearing\nthe same thing that they did during\n\n275\n00:16:00.998 --> 00:16:04.259\nthe Cold War with the stealth fighter,\nand then the F-117 came out.\n\n276\n00:16:04.259 --> 00:16:08.204\nAnd if you believe it or not,\nall the formulas were written way,\n\n277\n00:16:08.204 --> 00:16:10.460\nway back by a Russian guy.\n\n278\n00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.860\nSomeone in Soviet Union wrote\nthe formulas for the stealth fighter and\n\n279\n00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.770\nthey did not have the actual\ncomputing power around to do it.\n\n280\n00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:21.290\nSo they Lockee developed a program and\nsolved it.\n\n281\n00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.370\n>> Wow.\n>> So that's a change in difference there.\n\n282\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.720\nYeah, computing power it's amazing how it\ncan change things when you mix it into\n\n283\n00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.676\nthe whole thing.\n\n284\n00:16:29.676 --> 00:16:33.120\n>> I just got to hold onto my plans for my\ntransporter a little bit longer until that\n\n285\n00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.100\ntechnology catches up with my ideas there.\n\n286\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:36.730\n>> There you go.\n\n287\n00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:41.590\n>> All right so Sean, we got a good\nidea then about what makes an asymmetric\n\n288\n00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:46.220\nencryption algorithm two keys,\nthe key pair mathematically related but\n\n289\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.220\nyou can't figure out what\none is based on the other.\n\n290\n00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.040\nHas some really good features.\n\n291\n00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.400\nIt has the non-repudiation it can provide.\n\n292\n00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.532\nAnd it's also a little bit slower,\nit's more intense,\n\n293\n00:16:57.532 --> 00:17:00.080\nit's heavier on the processor.\n\n294\n00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.370\nWhat we need to probably some examples of\nasymmetrics to go along with our list and\n\n295\n00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:05.865\nour flashcards we're making.\n\n296\n00:17:05.865 --> 00:17:11.090\n>> Yeah, there's a few asymmetric\nsystems out there of note.\n\n297\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:15.651\nThe ones that you mentioned here RSA,\nRivest-Shamir-Adleman,\n\n298\n00:17:15.651 --> 00:17:18.451\nthat you're playing along that actually\n\n299\n00:17:18.451 --> 00:17:23.100\nhas the distinction of being\nthe first American asymmetric system.\n\n300\n00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:23.890\nIt still holds that.\n\n301\n00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.020\nIt's actually even after all these years,\nit's almost what,\n\n302\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.980\n40 years old I think now,\nit's still used all the time.\n\n303\n00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.250\nIt's still considered extremely strong and\n\n304\n00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.930\nvery functional so\nit's stood the test of time.\n\n305\n00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:42.400\nWe also have things like\nelliptical curve cryptography.\n\n306\n00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.650\nThat's still very much in use.\n\n307\n00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:50.200\nThat one is based off a problem\nof drawing a curve in memory,\n\n308\n00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.610\nmathematically drawing a curve in memory\nand intersecting a line through it, and\n\n309\n00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.140\nthen using those dots as a seed for a key.\n\n310\n00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.170\nSo very simplistic way of doing it.\n\n311\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.250\nThen you have other ones like elgamal and\nDiffie Hellman,\n\n312\n00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.460\nis actually another interesting one.\n\n313\n00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.800\nDiffie Hellman is one that's\nput into this category a lot.\n\n314\n00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.520\nIt's actually more correct to call\nDiffie Hellman a key exchange\n\n315\n00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:17.153\nsystem than it is to call it\na pure cryptographic system.\n\n316\n00:18:17.153 --> 00:18:22.430\nDiffie Hellman is good\nat creating a key for\n\n317\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.560\ntwo parties that have no prior\nrelationship with one another.\n\n318\n00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:32.220\nSo they can create a key that both of them\ncan use but they can do it in such a way\n\n319\n00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.720\nthat when they are agreeing upon a key,\nthere's no encryption going on between.\n\n320\n00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.110\nThey don't have a prior relationship.\n\n321\n00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.160\nSo they got to get a key here and here.\n\n322\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:39.850\nSo.\n\n323\n00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.510\n>> They've got to share\nsome information but\n\n324\n00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:45.100\nnobody else can figure out how to use\nthat information to generate the key?\n\n325\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.000\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n326\n00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.740\nAnd one really simple way to do it is say,\nwell both parties agree on the number two,\n\n327\n00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.700\nand then they take the two and go back\nin their corners, and one uses three and\n\n328\n00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.528\none uses four and\nthey multiply those numbers together.\n\n329\n00:18:57.528 --> 00:19:01.480\nAnd they exchange the results\nof that with one another, and\n\n330\n00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.770\nthey multiply that again by\nthe number they chose themselves, and\n\n331\n00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.170\nthey both will arrive at\nthe exact same number.\n\n332\n00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.500\nIf you multiply three numbers together,\n\n333\n00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.960\nno matter what sequence,\nyou're going to get the same result.\n\n334\n00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.540\nAnd that's what's happening there.\n\n335\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.510\nAnyone in between's just going\nto see a two, six, and an eight.\n\n336\n00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.524\nSo it's a fascinating way.\n\n337\n00:19:21.524 --> 00:19:27.181\nNow, obviously Diffie Hellman 's\nmagnitude's more complex than that,\n\n338\n00:19:27.181 --> 00:19:30.070\nbut you can see the core concept of it.\n\n339\n00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:34.833\nAnyone in between that situation is going\n\n340\n00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:39.430\nto be challenged to come up with\na correct one, and maybe not two, six,\n\n341\n00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.390\nand eight, but these bigger numbers,\nit's going to be a bit more challenging.\n\n342\n00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.510\nAnd then if you're using prime numbers and\nstuff like that.\n\n343\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.485\nYeah we've just ruined it for you.\n\n344\n00:19:48.485 --> 00:19:52.090\n[LAUGH] But\nthat's a key exchange protocol but\n\n345\n00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.480\ntypically they throw it\nin asymmetric category.\n\n346\n00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.060\nAnd then one last one I've got here noted.\n\n347\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.385\nThis is really just for kind of for\n\n348\n00:20:01.385 --> 00:20:04.975\ntrivia's sake is\nthe Merkle Helman Knapsack.\n\n349\n00:20:04.975 --> 00:20:06.775\n>> That's a new one on me there Sean.\n\n350\n00:20:06.775 --> 00:20:09.545\n>> That's yeah,\nwe found that here from last week's show.\n\n351\n00:20:09.545 --> 00:20:13.515\nThey left it behind it's in the lost and\nfound.\n\n352\n00:20:13.515 --> 00:20:16.725\n>> Should we go through it, do we have\nto wait 30 days before we open it up and\n\n353\n00:20:16.725 --> 00:20:17.655\nsee what's inside?\n\n354\n00:20:17.655 --> 00:20:19.435\n>> Yeah we may have to.\n\n355\n00:20:19.435 --> 00:20:23.994\nSo but what that is a I believe\nMerkel by the way Merkel was\n\n356\n00:20:23.994 --> 00:20:28.749\nother guy who's involved in\ncreation of diffie hellman.\n\n357\n00:20:28.749 --> 00:20:32.421\nI want to say he is you\ncan double check that or\n\n358\n00:20:32.421 --> 00:20:37.300\nI'm sure someone's looking\nit up feverishly right now.\n\n359\n00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.830\nI believe he was the third person\ninvolved in Diffie Hellman,\n\n360\n00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.560\nhe just never got any credit on it.\n\n361\n00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.520\nThe other guys, the other guys was like\nthere actually was a third guy involved\n\n362\n00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.590\nin the creation of Diffie Hellman.</as>\nAnd he never gets any credit,\n\n363\n00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.695\nhe's like, what the hell?\n\n364\n00:20:51.695 --> 00:20:53.500\n[LAUGHS]\n>> Who, chopped liver over here?\n\n365\n00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.670\n>> Well, now he's got one with his\nname on it so that's a good thing.\n\n366\n00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.420\n>> They were probably\nworking on this thing, and\n\n367\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.930\nthey were ordering pizza in, and he didn't\nput any money in, so they cut him out.\n\n368\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.520\nLike you're not getting credit for it.\n\n369\n00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.820\nSo but anyway, this knapsack one.\n\n370\n00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.370\nIt's not really used because\nit does have some flaws in it.\n\n371\n00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.510\nBut someone came up with\nthat by saying well heck,\n\n372\n00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.550\nwe're going to have a knapsack or\na package, if you want.\n\n373\n00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.260\nContainer of a given size.\n\n374\n00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.900\nThey chose a knapsack.\n\n375\n00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:29.420\nAnd they said, the encryption system and\nchoosing keys is based on a problem\n\n376\n00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.460\nthat says here you have a knapsack\nthat you're going to take on a hike or\n\n377\n00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.820\na camping trip and you have a bunch of\nitems here that you can take camping.\n\n378\n00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:42.370\nAnd the question is which ones are you\ngoing to put in and in which order.\n\n379\n00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.900\nYou can't take them all.\n\n380\n00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.330\nYou know so there was a finite\namount of space in that knapsack,\n\n381\n00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.110\nso you've got to figure out\nwhich one you want to take, and\n\n382\n00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.120\nwhich order they're going to go into,\nto get them to work.\n\n383\n00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:59.200\nSo interesting little\nway of approaching it.\n\n384\n00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.290\nIt's not really feasible, and\nit actually had some flaws in it.\n\n385\n00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:07.580\nBut just shows you the type of\nstuff that these guys come up with.\n\n386\n00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:11.640\nI think they were smoking something but-\n>> [LAUGH] Look at the creative process.\n\n387\n00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.310\n>> Only thing they were putting\nin their knapsack was Twinkies,\n\n388\n00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.708\nif you know what I'm saying.\n\n389\n00:22:15.708 --> 00:22:17.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n390\n00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.430\n>> But someone came up with that and\n\n391\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:24.260\nit was a interesting thing but\nit's a good example of\n\n392\n00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.970\nthe way sometimes you come up with\nnew cryptographic systems and\n\n393\n00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:32.280\nsometimes it takes this original\nthinking to come up with this and\n\n394\n00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.190\nthat's what they came up with.\n\n395\n00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:37.720\nAnd there's been crazier stuff\nthan that they come up with\n\n396\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.750\nthat's worked just as well.\n\n397\n00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:49.227\nThey have ones where someone said well\nheck, we need to generate a unique key.\n\n398\n00:22:49.227 --> 00:22:54.190\nWell one of the things that uses\ninput generating key is radioactive\n\n399\n00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.560\ndecay of a certain isotope.\n\n400\n00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.330\nBecause by using that and\nmixing it in, and\n\n401\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:03.060\nsaying well you have much amount of\na substance, decay this rate and\n\n402\n00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.330\nhow much would be left, and\nthey were able to use that as input to it.\n\n403\n00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:11.390\nAnd so it was fascinating,\nthat someone came up with that,\n\n404\n00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:15.550\nbut, you know it's,\nthat's never been used really either.\n\n405\n00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:19.040\nBecause it's just not workable, and\nthere's other issues there too.\n\n406\n00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.280\nSo yeah, David got it too.\n\n407\n00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.670\nIs that knapsack.\n\n408\n00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.530\nIt was broken, it was shown to be flawed.\n\n409\n00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:31.020\nIt was an interesting mental exercise\nI guess if you want to call it that.\n\n410\n00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.630\nOr someone was mental when\nthey came up with it.\n\n411\n00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:40.320\nBut yeah it's never really been used at\nall, except maybe in an academic area and\n\n412\n00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.630\nsome they use it just to illustrate some\nof the stuff but outside of that no.\n\n413\n00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:48.720\nAll right well Shawn a lot\nof good information there.\n\n414\n00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.120\nI think that gives us a good idea of how\nasymmetric encryption works and some good\n\n415\n00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.310\nexamples of some asymmetric outages that\nwe need to be familiar with the exam.\n\n416\n00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.110\nSo as Shawn was saying earlier,\n\n417\n00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:02.870\nmake your flash cards,\nis it symmetric is it asymmetric?\n\n418\n00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.897\nYou also said include if its stream or\ncipher so\n\n419\n00:24:05.897 --> 00:24:10.260\nwhen you're doing your studying\nput that name on there, symmetric,\n\n420\n00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.810\nasymmetric, stream or\nblock cipher and key length.\n\n421\n00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.287\nSome of them will have\nvarying key lengths, so\n\n422\n00:24:16.287 --> 00:24:19.625\nwe will need to know the range of\nkey the lengths on the others.\n\n423\n00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:24.920\n>> Yeah, that's information you need\nto know And yeah, those flashcards.\n\n424\n00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.040\nWhat you want to be doing is you want to\nbe able to put them in the right category\n\n425\n00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.000\nis the big thing.\n\n426\n00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.980\nAnd then after that is the other stuff so\nis the key and\n\n427\n00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.370\nblock or stream accordingly.\n\n428\n00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:39.230\nYou want to have those and\nonce you've got those down and heck,\n\n429\n00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.660\nif you can get the actual\nblock sizes in there too and\n\n430\n00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:46.620\nblock sizes, trust me, are really,\nreally easy to memorize.\n\n431\n00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.350\nBecause.\n>> There was only a couple.\n\n432\n00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:53.620\n>> Yeah pretty much most of them are 64,\nand then everything else,\n\n433\n00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:57.720\nand then there's like two or\nthree other ones that aren't 64.\n\n434\n00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:04.330\nSo memorize just the ones that the block\nsizes aren't 64 and you're done.\n\n435\n00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.320\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, it's simple,\n\n436\n00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.430\nthey're just trying to make it\nthe easy way to do this and\n\n437\n00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.230\nthat's the easy way to do this.\n\n438\n00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.310\n>> Yeah.\nVery good.\n\n439\n00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.090\nAll right.\nWell, ladies and\n\n440\n00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.570\ngentlemen, that's going to do it for\nthis episode.\n\n441\n00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.460\nWe hope you guys enjoyed watching,\nI know we enjoyed making it for you.\n\n442\n00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.260\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Roderic.\n\n443\n00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.020\n>> And I'm Shawn Oriyano.\n\n444\n00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.050\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

00:00:16.531\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:17.590\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.370\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.050\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.270\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.807\nWe are continuing on with our C-A-S-P, or\n\n9\n00:00:22.807 --> 00:00:27.165\nour CASP series, and in this episode\nwe're gonna be talking about Hashing.\n\n10\n00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:28.605\nSounds fun.\n\n11\n00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:29.573\nRight?\n\n12\n00:00:29.573 --> 00:00:30.167\n>> Yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:33.290\n>> [LAUGH] Too many jokes there,\nwe'll just leave them aside.\n\n14\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.250\nWe talked about Symmetric Encryption and\nAsymmetric Encryption,\n\n15\n00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.140\nand Hashing always gets lumped in\nwith these encryption algorithms.\n\n16\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.920\nRight?\n\n17\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.088\n>> Yeah, it's something that gets thrown\ninto the mix when you're talking about\n\n18\n00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:49.333\nencryption, but\nit's something that's part of the field.\n\n19\n00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:53.454\nIt's not part of the normal\nstuff that we're used to.\n\n20\n00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:58.105\nSo we need to spend a little bit of\ntime on talking about what sets it aside\n\n21\n00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:01.360\nfrom everything else and\nthen kind of fold it in and\n\n22\n00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.093\nwrap it in with everything else, see.\n\n23\n00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:06.178\nOkay.\nWhy is it significant on it's own and\n\n24\n00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:08.542\nwhy does it really add\nthe whole picture and\n\n25\n00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:12.625\ncreate even better solutions when it\nis wrapped in with everything else.\n\n26\n00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:14.844\nSo it's really kind of a neat thing.\n\n27\n00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:18.673\nAnd remember it does do if\nyou're following along here,\n\n28\n00:01:18.673 --> 00:01:23.860\nit does do something decidedly different\nthan Symmetric and Asymmetric.\n\n29\n00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.925\nSymmetric and Asymmetric dealt with other\nareas and mainly that confidentiality,\n\n30\n00:01:28.925 --> 00:01:33.250\nnon-repudiation and\nthe authentication aspect of it.\n\n31\n00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.120\nWe still haven't gone into that\nfourth area which is integrity.\n\n32\n00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.360\nSo, that where hashing's stepping into\nthis whole, into this discussion.\n\n33\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.360\nIt's bringing that to the table,\nwhich is vitally important to have.\n\n34\n00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.950\nSo.\n\n35\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.100\n>> That's one of our four goals and\nas we've seen so far, Symmetric and\n\n36\n00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.630\nAsymmetric don't hit that one.\n\n37\n00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.300\nSo we really need something that\ncan provide that data integrity.\n\n38\n00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.690\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\nWe absolutely have to have that.\n\n39\n00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.465\nSo, we've got the technology to do that.\n\n40\n00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:02.480\n>> All right, we're good.\n\n41\n00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.220\nWell, so how do we, hashing,\nthen, is a type of algorithm.\n\n42\n00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.495\nIt doesn't output encrypted, I don't know,\nwhat's a good way to say it, Sean?\n\n43\n00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:14.425\nOriginal text is not actually encrypted,\n\n44\n00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:17.610\nbut the output is an encrypted\nversion of my input.\n\n45\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.489\n>> Yeah, it's an.\n\n46\n00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.445\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n47\n00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:24.502\nthis is a common area to have issue\nwith because it's, depending on when and\n\n48\n00:02:24.502 --> 00:02:28.422\nwhere you kind of,\ndepending on who you talk to about it.\n\n49\n00:02:28.422 --> 00:02:31.982\nThey'll say,\noh yeah it is doing encryption but\n\n50\n00:02:31.982 --> 00:02:36.412\nit's one way encryption and other people\nsay no, it's not one way encryption.\n\n51\n00:02:36.412 --> 00:02:41.002\nAnd there's discussion of keys and\neverything else and why you can make all\n\n52\n00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:45.870\nof those descriptions fit,\nthey can lead to some confusion.\n\n53\n00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.860\nSo, I cannot just sit here and\nsay that it is doing encryption,\n\n54\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.570\nbecause conscription really when you\nlook at it, really saying that you're\n\n55\n00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.120\nconverting something to another format,\nso someone else can't get access to it.\n\n56\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.954\nHashing doesn't do that.\n\n57\n00:03:00.954 --> 00:03:05.761\nHashing does something entirely\ndifferent than that side of things.\n\n58\n00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:08.766\nSo it's important that we have that down.\n\n59\n00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:14.394\nSo let's really look at what hashing is,\nlet's smoke this hash.\n\n60\n00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:15.621\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n61\n00:03:15.621 --> 00:03:17.705\nyou didn't think I was gonna go there,\ndid you?\n\n62\n00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:18.755\n>> No.\n>> No, don't do it.\n\n63\n00:03:18.755 --> 00:03:20.741\nI don't care.\n\n64\n00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:22.142\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're all adults.\n\n65\n00:03:22.142 --> 00:03:24.836\nSo, all right.\n\n66\n00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:26.136\nBut what hashing is?\n\n67\n00:03:26.136 --> 00:03:30.876\nHashing is a process that goes one way and\n\n68\n00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:36.590\nit does not encrypt your\noriginal plain text.\n\n69\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.410\nYour plain text does go through the\nhashing algorithm but does not come out.\n\n70\n00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.290\nAs being something that's all\nscrabbled and all that jazz.\n\n71\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.190\nYou actually will still see\nthe original plain text but\n\n72\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.050\nyou also will have something else which\nrepresents the hashing aspect of it.\n\n73\n00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.240\nThat is going to be\na fixed length value and\n\n74\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.630\nit's gonna have a sequence of\ncharacters in it that are just gonna\n\n75\n00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.100\nappear to be random if\nit's done correctly.\n\n76\n00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.240\nAnd so,\nit's gonna always be the same length.\n\n77\n00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.270\nIt will be some random combination\nof these characters and\n\n78\n00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.760\nthose characters will be\nunique to that specific input.\n\n79\n00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.968\nOkay, so you feed something through, you\ngot a fix length, unique combinations of\n\n80\n00:04:17.968 --> 00:04:21.118\ncharacters that is tied back to\nwhatever is that plain text is.\n\n81\n00:04:21.118 --> 00:04:25.973\nNow, the significance of that is if\nsomeone wants to verify that the plain\n\n82\n00:04:25.973 --> 00:04:30.923\ntext that you gave them is what you\nintended them to have in the first place.\n\n83\n00:04:30.923 --> 00:04:35.514\nAnd has been unadultered, unaltered,\nall that type of stuff, well then,\n\n84\n00:04:35.514 --> 00:04:38.480\nthat person is gonna send to you the hash.\n\n85\n00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.230\nAnd they are also gonna send\nyou information on which\n\n86\n00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.780\nhashing algorithm they use.\n\n87\n00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.820\nAnd they will run it through\nthat same hashing algorithm and\n\n88\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.850\nif the two match, then you have\nsomething that not been changed,\n\n89\n00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.440\nif they don't then some has changed.\n\n90\n00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.311\nNow you can't immediately\ntell what is changed.\n\n91\n00:04:56.311 --> 00:05:00.967\nThere are ways to deal with that,\nbut you'll have to compare in what\n\n92\n00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:05.063\nthe original was versus what\nyou got on the plain text side.\n\n93\n00:05:05.063 --> 00:05:09.750\nBut you do know, and\ncan detect, an actual change.\n\n94\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.750\nAnd that's really what we're looking for\nis that the integrity of that document or\n\n95\n00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.240\ndata, or whatever it is,\nhas been compromised and therefore is\n\n96\n00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.250\nnot something you should be using as part\nof your process or consuming in any way.\n\n97\n00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.950\nYou need to get another copy of it and\nfind out what happened.\n\n98\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.430\n>> So with the hashing out really then,\nif I take a piece of data and I or\n\n99\n00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.320\nwhatever it is and I feed it through\nthe particular hashing algorithm.\n\n100\n00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.150\nI can feed that same input through that\nsame algorithm a hundred times and\n\n101\n00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.340\nit will always generate\nthe exact same output.\n\n102\n00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.870\nSo if I send that piece of data to you and\nyou run it through the same algorithm,\n\n103\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.190\nand you get the same output, then you\nknow that data hasn't been changed.\n\n104\n00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.670\nAnd so\nthat's really what it's doing for us.\n\n105\n00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.530\nAnd from the other side of that,\nif I send you data and\n\n106\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.628\nyou feed it through the exact same\nalgorithm and you get different output,\n\n107\n00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:06.158\nthen you know something has\nchanged during that transmission.\n\n108\n00:06:06.158 --> 00:06:10.048\n>> Yeah, exactly and that's the thing.\n\n109\n00:06:10.048 --> 00:06:12.780\nIt's hashing doesn't tell\nyou how it got changed and\n\n110\n00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.705\ntell you why it got changed\njust tells you it's changed.\n\n111\n00:06:15.705 --> 00:06:20.619\nAnd you have to, you kinda have\npick up the pieces from there and\n\n112\n00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:23.040\nfigure out how that happened.\n\n113\n00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.180\nIt could have been a corruption.\n\n114\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.449\nIt could have been a deliberate\ncorruption, you don't know.\n\n115\n00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.724\n>> [CROSSTALK] And\nsometimes we don't even care.\n\n116\n00:06:28.724 --> 00:06:29.600\nAnd sometimes we just save up.\n\n117\n00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.900\nLike you look at TCP or\nsomething like that and\n\n118\n00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.620\nit says well that one doesn't match.\n\n119\n00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.630\nI know it's not what was sent originally.\n\n120\n00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.410\nAnd you don't bother to\nfigure out what changes.\n\n121\n00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.040\nThrow it away and say send it again.\n\n122\n00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.910\n>> Yeah.\nThat's exactly right.\n\n123\n00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:42.756\nYou may not even care.\n\n124\n00:06:42.756 --> 00:06:44.330\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's just it's a matter of\n\n125\n00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.500\nit's not what you're supposed to have and\ntherefore, I will not use whatever it is.\n\n126\n00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.090\nSo that's a significant\nthing that it provides.\n\n127\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.730\nAnd just for the record to make\nsure you understand on it and\n\n128\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.550\nunderstand the different names it goes by.\n\n129\n00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.640\nThat fixed length value\nis called the Hash,\n\n130\n00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.360\nbut it's also called a Messes Digest.\n\n131\n00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.340\nIt can be called a thumbprint,\na fingerprint, a check sum.\n\n132\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.045\n>> Check sum, yeah.\n\n133\n00:07:07.045 --> 00:07:11.180\n>> There's different\nnames that it goes by, so\n\n134\n00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.310\nthey're all basically explaining and\ndescribing the exact same thing.\n\n135\n00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.130\nIt's just that someone\nelse has decided oh,\n\n136\n00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.790\nwell, this is what I'm going to call it.\n\n137\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.283\nDo remember that.\n>> And we see it all over the place,\n\n138\n00:07:24.283 --> 00:07:26.878\nlike I mentioned TCP, because it's a,\n\n139\n00:07:26.878 --> 00:07:30.634\nchecks to make sure those\npackets arrive at the other end.\n\n140\n00:07:30.634 --> 00:07:34.813\nWe see it in email where we're trying\nto make sure an email message.\n\n141\n00:07:34.813 --> 00:07:39.619\nThink when you download a disk of Linux,\nlike if you watch Star Canli Show we\n\n142\n00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:45.120\ndownload that disk, and up on that\nwebsite, they post an MD5 value.\n\n143\n00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.820\nCheck sum, or a hash value,\nwhatever they want to call it.\n\n144\n00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.460\nAnd that allows to make sure that\nthing we downloaded is complete and\n\n145\n00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.540\ndidn't get modified\nduring that transmission.\n\n146\n00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.387\nSo we see it everywhere.\n\n147\n00:07:54.387 --> 00:07:55.739\nThat's just a couple of places.\n\n148\n00:07:55.739 --> 00:07:59.396\n>> Yeah,\nit's just a huge part of what we do.\n\n149\n00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:04.508\nAlso to throw in to this whole thing\nis that it's not designed, unlike\n\n150\n00:08:04.508 --> 00:08:10.770\nour other forms, our other cryptographic\ntechnology we talked about so far.\n\n151\n00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.280\nIt's not designed to be reversed.\n\n152\n00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.790\nSo if you get a message digest, you\nbetter have the plain text because it's\n\n153\n00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.040\nconsidered to be mathematically\ninfeasible, that's the way I put it.\n\n154\n00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.220\nThey'll say impossible in a lot of cases,\nI'm going to say infeasible is probably\n\n155\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.850\na much better way to put it because\nthere has been ways to reverse them.\n\n156\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:28.755\nIt's that computing power issue again.\n\n157\n00:08:28.755 --> 00:08:32.730\n>> Technology's changed, power, yep.\n\n158\n00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:38.020\n>> So, do remember that they're designed\nto go one way and one way only.\n\n159\n00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.210\nSometimes they put in things like\ntrapdoor functions and stuff like that.\n\n160\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.170\nThat kind of gets to\na whole another level.\n\n161\n00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:48.440\nThey'll put those things in to make\nit difficult to go one way but\n\n162\n00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.520\nif you know this special function, you\ncan reverse it really quickly and easily.\n\n163\n00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.590\nBut you gotta know how that\nfunction works and what to feed it.\n\n164\n00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.810\nBut that's something for another time,\n\n165\n00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.550\nanother course,\nI guess is really the way to put that.\n\n166\n00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.460\n>> So we got a lot of different uses for\nhashing.\n\n167\n00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.235\nWhat are some of the the examples\nwe have of some hashing algorithms?\n\n168\n00:09:13.235 --> 00:09:14.835\n>> There's plenty of them out there.\n\n169\n00:09:14.835 --> 00:09:19.355\nBut the ones that really comes\ndown to are the MD series,\n\n170\n00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:20.985\nthe most popular one being MD 5.\n\n171\n00:09:20.985 --> 00:09:23.967\nYou've seen that one being\nused all over the place.\n\n172\n00:09:23.967 --> 00:09:31.200\nHeck, you know, I did some demos\nin the cryptography course we did.\n\n173\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.718\nBut, you know, and\nI can do the same demos here, but\n\n174\n00:09:33.718 --> 00:09:35.447\nyou guys can do them just as easily.\n\n175\n00:09:35.447 --> 00:09:39.911\nAll you have to do is go to Google,\ndo MD5 online generator.\n\n176\n00:09:39.911 --> 00:09:41.449\nThey're all over the place.\n\n177\n00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:45.697\nAnd you'll see right quickly and easily\nthat you put something in one of those\n\n178\n00:09:45.697 --> 00:09:49.700\ngenerators and hit create the hash,\nand it will create a hash for you.\n\n179\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.970\nChange one little thing on it, hash it\nagain, you will see it won't match.\n\n180\n00:09:53.970 --> 00:10:01.460\nMD5 is really one of the two that is one\nof the most widely used ones out there.\n\n181\n00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:07.050\nYou will see it used in everything from\ndigital certificates to to IP sec,\n\n182\n00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.400\nto a bunch of other things.\n\n183\n00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.950\nIt's really made its\nway all over the place.\n\n184\n00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.790\nHeck, that's why they\nuse them in forensics.\n\n185\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.460\nIt's very widely accepted and\nstandardized.\n\n186\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.530\nSo when we did our whole\nforensics exploration,\n\n187\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:25.420\none of the things you saw in there is\nthat when we gathered data it was hashed.\n\n188\n00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.550\nAnd we said MD5 is one of the ways\nyou can go, because people know it,\n\n189\n00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.200\nthey understand it, it's a standard and\n\n190\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.889\nit's a good way to verify\nthe integrity of your evidence.\n\n191\n00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:40.140\n>> And it brings to light a point\nthat you've already made, but\n\n192\n00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.238\njust to make sure you guys see that,\nyou can use this on an entire hard drive.\n\n193\n00:10:44.238 --> 00:10:47.540\nYou change one character on that\nentire hard drive in gigs and\n\n194\n00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.841\ngigs of data, add one little\nperiod in there somewhere, and\n\n195\n00:10:50.841 --> 00:10:53.575\nit changes the output of\nthat hashing algorithm.\n\n196\n00:10:53.575 --> 00:10:59.647\n>> Yeah, exactly, that's what the magic\nof this is, it can detect that change.\n\n197\n00:10:59.647 --> 00:11:04.453\nAnd that's what you wanna have,\nis you want to be a way to\n\n198\n00:11:04.453 --> 00:11:08.766\ndetect change that's\noccurred in a data source.\n\n199\n00:11:08.766 --> 00:11:12.719\nSo you want to know if that's trustworthy,\nif someone's you know messed with it or\n\n200\n00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:13.792\ndone something to it or\n\n201\n00:11:13.792 --> 00:11:17.020\nwhatever's happened to you it you\nwant to have a way to pick that up.\n\n202\n00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.191\n>> Absolutely.\n\n203\n00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.570\n>> So,\nthe two family of algorithms we have\n\n204\n00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.330\nthat are very widely used is MD,\nthe message digest series.\n\n205\n00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:32.630\nThen the other one is the SHA series,\nthe secure hash algorithm series.\n\n206\n00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.136\nThat's a whole family unto itself.\n\n207\n00:11:36.136 --> 00:11:43.360\nThat one has been gaining more\nsteam as the years have gone on.\n\n208\n00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.507\nAnd so you'll see at some point it's\nprobably likely to see a shift more and\n\n209\n00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:53.013\nmore and more to SHA, where that\nbecomes the dominant of the two.\n\n210\n00:11:53.013 --> 00:11:56.219\nRight now,\nthey both kind of share that space, but\n\n211\n00:11:56.219 --> 00:11:59.651\nSHA is the one that's kind of\nthe new kid on the block and\n\n212\n00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:04.200\nhas been shown to be something that\nis very reliable, very durable, and\n\n213\n00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.247\nit's something that's upgradeable too,\nwhich is a big deal.\n\n214\n00:12:08.247 --> 00:12:12.210\nMD5 is one of those things that it\nreally can't be easily upgraded.\n\n215\n00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.554\nThey never took that into\naccount SHA-1 has been written\n\n216\n00:12:15.554 --> 00:12:20.052\nin such a way that they can make changes\nto it and still have it work the same way,\n\n217\n00:12:20.052 --> 00:12:22.456\nthe internal components are different.\n\n218\n00:12:22.456 --> 00:12:26.339\n>> Yeah cuz SHA-1 is\nreally 128-bit output.\n\n219\n00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:29.310\nThere's SHA-256, there's SHA-512.\n\n220\n00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.440\nAnd they can keep going if they choose to.\n\n221\n00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.440\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n222\n00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.970\nThat's the magic of it.\n\n223\n00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:39.820\nIn fact they've got the first generation\nof SHA that they've had out there.\n\n224\n00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.430\nThat's already been kind of rolled out\nof widespread use because it's just\n\n225\n00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.540\nnot needed anymore and they found\nthat it didn't meet the requirements.\n\n226\n00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.220\nSo they were able to do upgrades and\ncome out with the next generation of it.\n\n227\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.470\nAnd that's just going to keep continuing\nuntil they find some reason not to\n\n228\n00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.840\nuse SHA all together.\n\n229\n00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.430\nThey can just keep changing these\ncomponents in the algorithm and\n\n230\n00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:05.210\nbumping up the strength and the power\nof it, and still be back where it's\n\n231\n00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:09.650\ncompatible to a degree,\nwith some of the older technologies.\n\n232\n00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.420\nSo it's kinda cool when you look at it.\n\n233\n00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.150\n>> And that's what we got, we got the MD\nseries, we got the SHA series, and then\n\n234\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.360\nthere's some that aren't as common, but\nstill used out there in various places.\n\n235\n00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.270\n>> Yeah, there's other ones.\n\n236\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.710\nYou'll hear the names out there\nlike HAVAL is one you'll hear.\n\n237\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:28.617\nThat's actually a derivation of\nthe first two we talked about.\n\n238\n00:13:28.617 --> 00:13:34.194\nSo we'll see that one\nbeing use in some places.\n\n239\n00:13:34.194 --> 00:13:36.722\nMessage authentication code and H MAC,\n\n240\n00:13:36.722 --> 00:13:42.000\nthose ones are used really kind of where\ndigital signatures are being used.\n\n241\n00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.950\nThat's something that was put\nforth that didn't really catch on,\n\n242\n00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:51.750\ndidn't catch a lot of steam behind it,\nso they kind of faded off.\n\n243\n00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:56.679\nIn fact, if memory serves, MAC and\nHMAC, the federal government here in\n\n244\n00:13:56.679 --> 00:14:01.303\nthe States used it for awhile and\nthe DOD, here, used it for awhile.\n\n245\n00:14:01.303 --> 00:14:04.265\nBut they decided to switch over to using\n\n246\n00:14:04.265 --> 00:14:09.127\nmore standardized things that\nwere industry standard as well.\n\n247\n00:14:09.127 --> 00:14:12.480\nSo these ones got marginalized more and\nmore and more.\n\n248\n00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.890\nIt doesn't mean you won't run into them,\n\n249\n00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:18.308\nit just means that they're very specific\nin the areas where you'll see them.\n\n250\n00:14:18.308 --> 00:14:25.256\n>> Nice, so then hashing is really giving\nus the ability to do that data integrity,\n\n251\n00:14:25.256 --> 00:14:30.176\nbut that's really the only\ngoal that it solves, right?\n\n252\n00:14:30.176 --> 00:14:31.947\nIt doesn't hit any of\nthe other three areas?\n\n253\n00:14:31.947 --> 00:14:35.460\n>> Yeah,\nit doesn't cover any of those areas.\n\n254\n00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.070\nDoes not do confidentiality at all.\n\n255\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.118\nHowever, if you get down to it for\nthe non-repudiation aspect of it,\n\n256\n00:14:43.118 --> 00:14:45.185\nit does have a role to play in there.\n\n257\n00:14:45.185 --> 00:14:50.850\nIt's a player, among many,\nin the non-repudiation part.\n\n258\n00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.182\nBecause if you look at something\nlike digital signatures,\n\n259\n00:14:54.182 --> 00:14:59.123\nsomething that we'll have a discussion on,\ndigital signatures need hashing to work.\n\n260\n00:14:59.123 --> 00:15:02.230\nAnd so it's player there.\n\n261\n00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.850\nSame thing with authentication,\n\n262\n00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.790\nauthentication does use hashing a lot\nof times as part of its process.\n\n263\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.400\nIn fact, you could In some senses,\n\n264\n00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.980\nuse hashing to actually do\nthe authentication process.\n\n265\n00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.020\nWe don't even have to go that far for\nexamples of it, we have things like\n\n266\n00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.632\nthe Challenge-Handshake Authentication\nprotocol for example.\n\n267\n00:15:22.632 --> 00:15:27.280\nLM, NTLM, stuff like that,\nthey do use that.\n\n268\n00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.807\nNow granted LM, and stuff like that,\nthose are older and aren't being, or\n\n269\n00:15:31.807 --> 00:15:35.930\nshouldn't be being used, but\nit is something that does utilize it.\n\n270\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.352\nSo we do use it in those areas as well.\n\n271\n00:15:38.352 --> 00:15:43.674\nBut typically when we look at\nhashing algorithms, it's integrity,\n\n272\n00:15:43.674 --> 00:15:48.378\nand then they have a role to\nplay inside of non-repudiation.\n\n273\n00:15:48.378 --> 00:15:51.760\nSo those are the two ones that you'd\nexpect to really see it within.\n\n274\n00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.438\n>> And so\nthat kind of brings us back around to that\n\n275\n00:15:54.438 --> 00:15:56.367\nconcept of a hybrid encryption.\n\n276\n00:15:56.367 --> 00:15:59.966\nBecause we can take that hashing and\ncombine it with some other things and\n\n277\n00:15:59.966 --> 00:16:01.686\ncover all those other goals then.\n\n278\n00:16:01.686 --> 00:16:06.476\nYeah absolutely, is that by\ncombining this with our other ones,\n\n279\n00:16:06.476 --> 00:16:12.416\nyou can get a very, very strong solution\nwhich is really what the goal of this is.\n\n280\n00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:16.387\nIs that all of them do their\njob pretty well on their own,\n\n281\n00:16:16.387 --> 00:16:19.777\nif you use them in areas\nwhere they're strong.\n\n282\n00:16:19.777 --> 00:16:22.749\nBut if you wanna get\nan even stronger solution,\n\n283\n00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:27.450\nyou can wrap all these things together and\nmake an even stronger solution.\n\n284\n00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:33.020\nYou can combine things like symmetric and\nasymmetric, we've seen.\n\n285\n00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.810\nYou can combine asymmetric and hashing.\n\n286\n00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:42.120\nYou can do just various combinations to\narrive at a solution that just wouldn't be\n\n287\n00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.000\npossible if these different technologies\nweren't able to mate up together.\n\n288\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.211\nSo do remember that, when you think\nabout what something's doing and\n\n289\n00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:56.284\nhow it operates and\nwhen you talk about cryptography.\n\n290\n00:16:56.284 --> 00:16:58.679\nYou can pretty much,\nonce you start breaking it down,\n\n291\n00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:02.376\nif it's not readily obvious, you can start\nbreaking it down and say oh, okay yeah,\n\n292\n00:17:02.376 --> 00:17:03.750\nnow I can see what's going on.\n\n293\n00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.360\nYou look at this\nnon-repudiation part of it,\n\n294\n00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.370\nif I need to make sure it came from\nsomebody, well that's clearly asymmetric.\n\n295\n00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:14.286\nNow if I wanna apply that as\na digital signature, well then,\n\n296\n00:17:14.286 --> 00:17:18.060\nwhen you think about a signature on any\ndocument, it means you're agreeing to\n\n297\n00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.460\na specific version of a document and\nthe signature ties it back to you.\n\n298\n00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.150\nSo if you break it down to those two,\nnow what do you have?\n\n299\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.170\nYou have asymmetric and you've got\nhashing, because you need to verify\n\n300\n00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.990\nthe version of the document, and you need\nto tie it back to a specific individual.\n\n301\n00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:37.290\nSo, you've got the two coming\ntogether to form that solution.\n\n302\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.704\nSo be prepared to do that,\nand it's not difficult, and\n\n303\n00:17:40.704 --> 00:17:43.828\nit's something that will\nget you a lot of mileage,\n\n304\n00:17:43.828 --> 00:17:47.540\nto be able to break them down\nthat way if you get confused.\n\n305\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:52.793\n>> So really important then on that exam\nis to understand where those different,\n\n306\n00:17:52.793 --> 00:17:57.568\nI don't wanna say formats, but\nwhere symmetric, what part it plays,\n\n307\n00:17:57.568 --> 00:17:59.340\nasymmetric and hashing.\n\n308\n00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.590\nSo if they say we need a solution that\nprovides integrity and non-repudiation,\n\n309\n00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:07.224\nyou can figure out what components\nyou need to bring to the solution.\n\n310\n00:18:07.224 --> 00:18:11.046\n>> Yeah, absolutely,\nthat's the important part of this,\n\n311\n00:18:11.046 --> 00:18:15.720\nis knowing which things are going\nto get you where you wanna be.\n\n312\n00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.031\nAnd once you can figure out what solutions\nare gonna get you where you wanna be,\n\n313\n00:18:20.031 --> 00:18:22.719\nthen heck, you can mix and\nmatch them together.\n\n314\n00:18:22.719 --> 00:18:27.525\nYou can use all of them together, I mean\nthere's no reason why you can't do that.\n\n315\n00:18:27.525 --> 00:18:28.755\n>> Oh, good.\n\n316\n00:18:28.755 --> 00:18:31.751\nAll right, well Sean,\na lot of good information on hashing.\n\n317\n00:18:31.751 --> 00:18:34.420\nAnything else we need to\nunderstand about hashing?\n\n318\n00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:39.938\n>> Just to summarize, to make sure,\nbecause I think it's important to do.\n\n319\n00:18:39.938 --> 00:18:44.326\nIs to summarize on hashing is that,\nremember, it goes one way,\n\n320\n00:18:44.326 --> 00:18:46.862\nit always generates unique output.\n\n321\n00:18:46.862 --> 00:18:52.090\nFor every unique input, it generates\na unique output, so we have to have that.\n\n322\n00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:58.676\nThat output is gonna be gonna be called\na digest, a hash, a fingerprint,\n\n323\n00:18:58.676 --> 00:19:02.034\nthumb print, I mean,\nyou've got a CRC, checksums,\n\n324\n00:19:02.034 --> 00:19:05.259\nthings like that that all\nfit in that same category.\n\n325\n00:19:05.259 --> 00:19:10.438\nAs far as popular versions of it,\nwe have the MD series and the SHA series.\n\n326\n00:19:10.438 --> 00:19:13.200\nI mean, yeah, there are other\nones out there to be sure, but\n\n327\n00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.490\nthose are the ones that tend to get\nthe attention in this specific market.\n\n328\n00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.170\nThose are the ones that your\n\n329\n00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.390\ncertificate authorities use\nto verify their certificates.\n\n330\n00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:30.289\nThat is the ones you see in just about all\nforensic software when you're trying to\n\n331\n00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:31.740\ngo to verify evidence.\n\n332\n00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:38.850\nIPsec, all those guys, they all use\nthose two algorithms as their go-tos.\n\n333\n00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.970\nSo the other ones, yes, they will be\nout there, but they're very, very\n\n334\n00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:47.520\nmarginal in the whole scheme of things\non where you're gonna encounter them.\n\n335\n00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.583\nSo do remember what they are, but\n\n336\n00:19:49.583 --> 00:19:54.167\nyou're pretty much gonna be served\njust by remembering kinda those two.\n\n337\n00:19:54.167 --> 00:19:58.295\nAnd so you know the deal with the flash\ncards, we've been through it already.\n\n338\n00:19:58.295 --> 00:20:02.565\nYou should know your hashing algorithms\nbecause they're just important\n\n339\n00:20:02.565 --> 00:20:03.695\nto understand.\n\n340\n00:20:03.695 --> 00:20:05.649\n>> We need to know that cuz now\nyou said they're a fixed length.\n\n341\n00:20:05.649 --> 00:20:08.262\nAnd when we talk about\nencryption algorithms,\n\n342\n00:20:08.262 --> 00:20:11.607\nwe might talk about the key size\nthat we use along with those.\n\n343\n00:20:11.607 --> 00:20:15.499\nWhen we talk about hashing though,\nlike SHA-256 versus SHA-512,\n\n344\n00:20:15.499 --> 00:20:18.804\nthat's really dealing with that\nfixed length output, right?\n\n345\n00:20:18.804 --> 00:20:22.821\nSHA-128 has a 128-bit fixed length output.\n\n346\n00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:28.160\nSHA-256, it's 256-bit length\noutput every single time.\n\n347\n00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.865\nSo a little bit different than\nwhat we think of with our hash or\n\n348\n00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:32.201\nour encryption algorithms.\n\n349\n00:20:32.201 --> 00:20:35.359\n>> Yeah exactly, you're not going to be\nmemorizing the exact same information.\n\n350\n00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:39.566\nThat's what makes this one of those\ncritical areas where you do wanna spend\n\n351\n00:20:39.566 --> 00:20:42.704\nsome time studying to make\nsure you can understand hey,\n\n352\n00:20:42.704 --> 00:20:46.041\nthese are not only the ones that\nfit into this category, but\n\n353\n00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:48.610\nthis is what's gonna\ncome out the back side.\n\n354\n00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:53.770\nIt's not gonna be block size and key\nlength, that just doesn't play in here.\n\n355\n00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.192\nIt's got something else,\nwhich is the hashing length.\n\n356\n00:20:56.192 --> 00:21:01.975\nSo that's gonna get you the most mileage\nout of that, [LAUGH] as we've been saying.\n\n357\n00:21:01.975 --> 00:21:03.615\n>> [LAUGH] Very good, all right.\n\n358\n00:21:03.615 --> 00:21:06.216\nWell ladies and gentlemen,\nhope you enjoyed this episode,\n\n359\n00:21:06.216 --> 00:21:08.979\na lot of good information about hashing,\nhashing algorithms.\n\n360\n00:21:08.979 --> 00:21:12.880\nBut for now signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n361\n00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.030\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n362\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:14.980\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n363\n00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.080\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.280\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.220\nHow's it going, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.510\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.120\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.890\nWe are continuing on with our CASP series,\nand in this particular one,\n\n8\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.710\nwe're gonna be looking at good old PKI,\nor public key infrastructure.\n\n9\n00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.552\nNow we've taken a look at a lot\nof symmetric, and asymmetric, and\n\n10\n00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:37.876\nhashing in our previous episodes, and\nI guess asymmetric in particular,\n\n11\n00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:39.865\nkind of relies on some key pairs and\n\n12\n00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:44.350\npublic key infrastructure as one of those\nthings we can use to help with that.\n\n13\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.950\n>> Yes indeed it is, is that when\nwe're looking at, when we go back and\n\n14\n00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.980\nlook at asymmetric and we have that\nkey pair, and one of them is gonna be\n\n15\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.990\ngiven to a user, and then one's gonna be\nput someplace, where everyone can get it,\n\n16\n00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.020\nthat becomes a public key\n>> So we have to have,\n\n17\n00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.080\nwhen you look at those, there has to be\na way to actually manage those things.\n\n18\n00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.880\nYou can't just randomly throw a bunch of\nkeys, so to speak, into a pile, and say,\n\n19\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.350\ngo find it,\ncuz that's not going to help you.\n\n20\n00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.700\nIt has to be tied to an identity, and\nit has to be managed, and it has to be\n\n21\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.950\nenrolled, managed, revoked, all those\nthings that go with it, has to be done.\n\n22\n00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.020\nAnd you need to make sure that they are\nissued, or people can enroll in the system\n\n23\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.950\nin the first place, to get those keys,\ncuz not everyone needs them, so\n\n24\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.650\nthere has to be some structure in place,\nand that is what PKI does.\n\n25\n00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.880\nPKI Is the way we use, or the method we\nuse, to actually manage these keys and\n\n26\n00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.310\ndo all this validation, plus a bunch\nof other stuff that goes with it.\n\n27\n00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.460\nIt's actually very simple structure wise,\nbut\n\n28\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.719\nthe power it gives us, and\nthe abilities it gives us,\n\n29\n00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.160\nis just way, way, way important and\namazing that it does these things.\n\n30\n00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.870\nIn fact, this is where, when you look at\nPKI, we said asymmetric cryptography,\n\n31\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.650\nPKI also sometimes lends its\nname to asymmetric systems, and\n\n32\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.940\nthey sometimes call those\nPublic key cryptography, too.\n\n33\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.906\nSo if you hear that name, that's just\nanother way of saying asymmetric, but\n\n34\n00:02:17.906 --> 00:02:21.081\nwhen they say public key,\nthey're typically acknowledging\n\n35\n00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:25.860\nthe fact that yeah, it also relies on\nanother system to really work effectively.\n\n36\n00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.790\n>> So when they say public key or\ncryptography, they're not saying there's\n\n37\n00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.870\njust one key, they really\nare referring to an asymmetric system.\n\n38\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.920\n>> Yes, exactly, that's 100% what it is.\n\n39\n00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.270\n>> Good, all right, so\na lot of different components then,\n\n40\n00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.510\nthat make up my public key infrastructure,\nand this is something we can run in house?\n\n41\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.720\n>> You can choose to do that,\nas a matter of fact.\n\n42\n00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.760\nWhen you set up a PKI structure,\nwhat you're doing is you're setting up\n\n43\n00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.540\nsomething called\na certification authority.\n\n44\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.510\nAnd that certification authority,\njust gonna be a box that, people go to,\n\n45\n00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.650\nto request to be added to the system,\nand then they're checked to see if\n\n46\n00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.410\nthey're allowed to be added to the system,\nand if they are they generates the keys,\n\n47\n00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.150\nand it's also gonna generate something\ncalled certificate which we'll get to.\n\n48\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.250\nIt does all those things, and\nit even responds to requests\n\n49\n00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.450\nto validate that individuals\ncredentials a little later on, so\n\n50\n00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.030\nyou can choose to put that all on site, if\nyou're doing all your stuff on site, and\n\n51\n00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.370\nyou wanna have that CA completely under\nyour control, then hey go for it.\n\n52\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.820\nYou can use that one on site, but\nif you want to start communicating\n\n53\n00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.140\nwith other parties, and maybe offload\nsome of that, the security issues,\n\n54\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.430\nbecause you have to keep a PKI system\nvery, very secure and very safe.\n\n55\n00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.850\nIf you want to offload that\nfrom your own structure,\n\n56\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.760\nyou could just go with\nthe a commercial one.\n\n57\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.740\nYou can go with somebody like Thawte or\nVerisign or\n\n58\n00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.480\nany other names that are out there.\n\n59\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.360\nYou can go with them and that way,\nyou go and pay them money, and\n\n60\n00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.990\nthey give you a certificate for\nwhatever purpose that you need.\n\n61\n00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.150\nAnd then you're ready to go.\n\n62\n00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.220\nIt can be for email.\n\n63\n00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.560\nIt can be for SSL.\n\n64\n00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.960\nIt can be for you name it.\n\n65\n00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.790\nThey can issues a certificate for\nyou, to go ahead and use.\n\n66\n00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.910\n>> So we can set up our own certificate\nauthority, or CA as we like to call it.\n\n67\n00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.440\nOr we could use one of those public ones,\nand\n\n68\n00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.530\nagain you said the advantage is\nreally about the trust, right?\n\n69\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.425\nIf I'm keeping it all in house, I can\nset up my own, and I have no problems.\n\n70\n00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:30.112\nIf I've got to do things\nwith other organizations,\n\n71\n00:04:30.112 --> 00:04:35.965\nthat's when that public\nprovided CA comes in handy.\n\n72\n00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:37.460\n>> Yeah, it very much does.\n\n73\n00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.900\nNow, it used to be for a long time,\n\n74\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.050\nthe discussion on it was that, if you\nneeded to communicate with third parties,\n\n75\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.420\nand validate back and forth,\noutside of your organization,\n\n76\n00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.660\nthen you pretty much fell squarely into\nthe realm of, you wanted to go commercial.\n\n77\n00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.050\nBut that is kinda changing,\nbecause you do have that trust thing,\n\n78\n00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.670\nand a company saying well, instead of\nme offloading that to a third party,\n\n79\n00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.950\nI'm gonna manage my stuff in house, and\nI'll set up a trust relationship with\n\n80\n00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.520\nsomething on the outside, that way I\nhave all my stuff under my control, but\n\n81\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.000\nthey'll still validate\na certain way outside.\n\n82\n00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.600\nAnd so you're seeing that actually pop up.\n\n83\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.630\nAnd you can argue either way, if that's\nmore secure, less secure or what have you.\n\n84\n00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.940\nBut it is something that is being\ndone by certain organizations.\n\n85\n00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.880\nThat's not suitable for\nevery organization to do, but\n\n86\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.900\nsome organizations have done that.\n\n87\n00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.430\nUsually you're talking, like large\ngovernmental organizations or enterprise\n\n88\n00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.620\ncompanies, they're gonna do that sort of\nthing, just to make things much safer or\n\n89\n00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.180\nmuch more trust worthy,\nas far as their stuff goes.\n\n90\n00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.480\n>> There is an advantage\nto keeping it in house.\n\n91\n00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.580\nYou got much more managerial\ncontrol over like,\n\n92\n00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.070\nvalidity periods, and\ncost might be another thing to consider,\n\n93\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.815\ndepending on how many certificates\nwe need to generate, right?\n\n94\n00:06:00.815 --> 00:06:02.600\n>> Oh yeah, certificates aren't cheap.\n\n95\n00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.780\nDepends on how long you're gonna get them\nfor, and what they're being used for.\n\n96\n00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.190\nThey can really go up in cost.\n\n97\n00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.000\nYou can get certificates out there for\npersonal use for free, but\n\n98\n00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.298\nthose aren't really,\nthose have not been validated.\n\n99\n00:06:17.298 --> 00:06:21.990\nIf you get a validated one, which is where\nyou provide some forms of identification\n\n100\n00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.410\nto whoever issued that,\nthey will mark certificate as valid.\n\n101\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.100\nAnd those can be anywhere\nfrom five to twenty\n\n102\n00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.620\nsome odd dollars a year in some case,\nor maybe even more.\n\n103\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.490\nFifty or a hundred dollars.\n\n104\n00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.180\nBut, when you start doing things for\neCommerce, and it's gonna be for\n\n105\n00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.120\nseveral years, you could be\ntalking a thousand, ten thousand.\n\n106\n00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.120\nAnd it can keep going up, so\nit really kind of depends, but\n\n107\n00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.990\nsome companies will just push it inside.\n\n108\n00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.130\nIf I'm not doing those things, I might\njust say for all my employees internally,\n\n109\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.550\nI'm gonna have my certificate\nauthority set up internally for them,\n\n110\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.830\nand then if I'm gonna set\nup an eCommerce website,\n\n111\n00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.370\nwell then I'll just go buy\na certificate for that.\n\n112\n00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.510\nI'll limit my exposure, and the amount\nof money I'm laying out to do this.\n\n113\n00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.220\nSo you can mix and match,\n>> Nice.\n\n114\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.180\n>> there's really no problem with that.\n\n115\n00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.200\nThat's done all the time.\n\n116\n00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.170\nThe big important thing there, is to make\nsure that if you're using multiple CAs,\n\n117\n00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.280\nand you want to make\nsure it's all seamless,\n\n118\n00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.080\nyou need to consider something called\na chain of trust between them.\n\n119\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.740\nWhich means that if they're two\ndifferent CA's that they do say,\n\n120\n00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.930\nok we trust one another.\n\n121\n00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.920\nThat way certificates can validate\nacross and work together.\n\n122\n00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.762\n>> Oh, ok.\n\n123\n00:07:29.762 --> 00:07:33.870\nAnd then a lot of different components\nthat make up our public infrastructure,\n\n124\n00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.070\nit's not just setting up one server well,\nand we can start combining roles.\n\n125\n00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.940\nBut when we look at it logically, there's\na lot of different pieces to it right?\n\n126\n00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.313\n>> Yeah, you can have it\nall sitting on one box, but\n\n127\n00:07:46.313 --> 00:07:51.550\nthat really glosses over and\nsimplifies stuff way to far.\n\n128\n00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.874\nYou can definitely go into\na Windows system and say, okay,\n\n129\n00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:59.210\nwell I'm gonna put a CA right here on\nthis box, and that's it, and it works.\n\n130\n00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.250\nAnd it will work and\nthat can be just fine.\n\n131\n00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.341\nBut once you start dissecting it,\n\n132\n00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:08.110\nthere's actually more things going on\nthere inside the confines of that box.\n\n133\n00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:12.210\nThere's processes that do\nall the things we mentioned.\n\n134\n00:08:13.565 --> 00:08:18.685\nThat do the validation,\ndo the revoking, publish the lists\n\n135\n00:08:18.685 --> 00:08:23.095\nof revoked certificates, respond to\nqueries of revoked certificates.\n\n136\n00:08:23.095 --> 00:08:25.670\nThere's just a number of\nthings that can happen there.\n\n137\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:30.335\nAnd one of the big things they play is\nnot just generating the key pair and\n\n138\n00:08:30.335 --> 00:08:35.300\ndoing all other stuff, something that kind\nof popped up in discussion just a bit, but\n\n139\n00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.650\nI didn't focus on it at that time is\nthose actual digital certificates.\n\n140\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.010\nBecause I can't have you just rolling\nthe system and going here's the key,\n\n141\n00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:48.160\nand so, it's like, well,\nhow do I know that's your key?\n\n142\n00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.690\nWell they take that key and give you\nthe private one and then you've got\n\n143\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:56.100\nthe certificate up there, it has all your\ndetails on it that validate out to you.\n\n144\n00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.550\nAnd then they stick there key on it, and\nthey bind it together, and sign it by\n\n145\n00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.430\nthe person that issued it to you, and that\nshows that, hey, when someone asks for\n\n146\n00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:08.620\nyou, this is a validated certificate that\nsays, hey this is you, and they can take\n\n147\n00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.130\na copy of that key and presumably reverse\nanything you did with your private key.\n\n148\n00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.160\nSo that's something else that's very, very\nimportant for them to do as a manager.\n\n149\n00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.400\nNot just the keys but the certificates\nthat also tie to those keys to say\n\n150\n00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.800\nwho owns what or\nwho's responsible for what.\n\n151\n00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.920\nIf you don't have that,\nhow do I know that's your key.\n\n152\n00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.620\nThat's what digital certificate's\ngoing to do for you.\n\n153\n00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.010\n>> So it has to do with a lot of things.\n\n154\n00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.930\nWe're getting our key pair, but\nit's also making sure that key pair is\n\n155\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.646\nassociated with us and\nthat gives us another level of security.\n\n156\n00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:40.983\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n157\n00:09:40.983 --> 00:09:41.960\n>> Very good.\n\n158\n00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.590\nAll right, so let's break down some\nof the different components here.\n\n159\n00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.610\nwe talk about CA, or Certificate\nAuthority, and in a Microsoft world,\n\n160\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.400\nsometimes we kinda lump\neverything together.\n\n161\n00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.940\nWe just call it CA.\n\n162\n00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.020\nBut, there are some different pieces, like\nyou mentioned the registration authority.\n\n163\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.230\nWhat's his role in this?\n\n164\n00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.110\n>> You know, a registration\nauthority is one of those ones that\n\n165\n00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.010\nyou actually do hear about\nfrom time to time, but\n\n166\n00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.310\nit's, and I think unfortunately\nbecause we tend to say,\n\n167\n00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.645\neverything's a CA, certificates pass\nthrough it any way, shape, or form.\n\n168\n00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:12.744\nIt's a CA.\n\n169\n00:10:12.744 --> 00:10:14.730\nIt's not as easy.\n\n170\n00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.210\n>> If you live in the Microsoft world and\nyou never study outside of Microsoft,\n\n171\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.905\nyou won't hear the term\nregistration authority.\n\n172\n00:10:19.905 --> 00:10:23.620\n[LAUGH]\n>> That is very much true.\n\n173\n00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:30.510\nCome to think of it,\nthat is something that when I did\n\n174\n00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:35.040\nmy first book on registration authorities,\npeople that were doing that were people\n\n175\n00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.460\nthat were getting into the information\nsecurity field had questions on it.\n\n176\n00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.140\nLike don't you mean\ncertification authorities?\n\n177\n00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.070\n[LAUGH] I never thought\nthat was the reason why,\n\n178\n00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.050\nbecause a lot of them\nwere coming from there.\n\n179\n00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:44.610\n>> Yep.\n>> But\n\n180\n00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:50.260\nthe registration authority,\nit's not the same as a CA.\n\n181\n00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.900\nIt's something that does just what it's\nname implies, it takes your information,\n\n182\n00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.430\nand registers in the system, and then\na certificate needs to be created for you.\n\n183\n00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.150\nThat's the sole responsibility of the CA.\n\n184\n00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.860\nAnd so\n\n185\n00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:06.630\nyou can have an RA out there to off load\nsome of this responsibility from the CA so\n\n186\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:11.540\nit's not getting hammered with all\nthe stuff all the time, if you so choose.\n\n187\n00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.540\nIt doesn't have the certificate\ndatabase on there.\n\n188\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.060\nIt doesn't have the console for management\nand all that the main big guy does.\n\n189\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.850\nAnd doesn't have the security requirements\neither that go with those things.\n\n190\n00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.783\nYou need to be clear on that.\n\n191\n00:11:26.783 --> 00:11:30.620\nOnce you get inside the Microsoft world,\nyou'll hear RAs all the time.\n\n192\n00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.020\nYou could actually, if you wanted to,\n\n193\n00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:36.240\nyou could go to one of the main players\nthat have certificate authorities.\n\n194\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.310\nYou can go to them and\nsay well I want to set up an RA, and\n\n195\n00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:45.220\nyou can set one up for them, and become\na client of them that helps them out.\n\n196\n00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.430\nBut if you wanna set up a CA,\nthen that's a whole different matter.\n\n197\n00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.530\nYou can set one of those up too, but\n\n198\n00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.970\nthe security requirements\nare ratcheted up through the roof.\n\n199\n00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.660\nFor that, so just-\n>> And I guess to be fair to Microsoft, I\n\n200\n00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.030\nmean, we've got an active directory, which\nkinda becomes our registration authority.\n\n201\n00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:04.750\nA lot of it depends on you being\nauthenticated in the system, right?\n\n202\n00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.550\nAnd then you connect to\nthat certificate authority.\n\n203\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.230\nBut yeah, it's not broken out\nas a separate component, but for\n\n204\n00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.710\nthis exam we're not dealing\nwith Microsoft, right?\n\n205\n00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.630\nWe're dealing with the concepts and\nin general.\n\n206\n00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.260\nAnd we've gotta understand what that\nregistration authority is responsible for.\n\n207\n00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.290\nAnd that's for proving your identity.\n\n208\n00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.430\nBecause I can't walk in,\nI shouldn't be able to walk in and say my\n\n209\n00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.550\nname's Shawn Ariano, I want a certificate,\nissue me one please, all right?\n\n210\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:32.220\n>> Yeah, exactly, they've gotta be some\nsort of proof that goes with that.\n\n211\n00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.380\nTo say that you are indeed that person.\n\n212\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.450\nYou can't just claim that.\n\n213\n00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.090\nThat's what's significance\nthis whole thing is.\n\n214\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.030\nAnd do remember,\nsince you're mentioning it, yeah,\n\n215\n00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.730\nthis isn't just a Microsoft thing.\n\n216\n00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.160\nIt's kind of just build on that a bit.\n\n217\n00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:53.340\nIt is important to recognize that PKI,\nwe can talk about this for as long as we\n\n218\n00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:58.850\nwanted to, we don't ever have to mention\na specific operating system or platform.\n\n219\n00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.320\nThis is a standard.\n\n220\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.960\nThis isn't something that's\ntied to a specific vendor.\n\n221\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.550\nSo Microsoft stuff can play with Linux and\nUNIX and what have you, it's a standard.\n\n222\n00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:17.060\nThose things all set up to follow certain\nrules have been placed out there.\n\n223\n00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.535\nSo you can go with different companies and\nthey can all play nice together,\n\n224\n00:13:20.535 --> 00:13:22.272\nbecause its all been standardized.\n\n225\n00:13:22.272 --> 00:13:26.240\n>> All right, so\nwe've got our registration authority,\n\n226\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.120\nwe've got our certificate authority.\n\n227\n00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.640\nWhat are some of the other big\ncomponents we've got to worry about?\n\n228\n00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.540\n>> One of the big ones I\nthink is worth taking about\n\n229\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.380\nhere is certificate relocation list.\n\n230\n00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.990\nCertificate relocation\nlist is a certificate\n\n231\n00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:45.450\nthat is something like a driver's license,\nthat credential.\n\n232\n00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.830\nA passport, anything like it.\n\n233\n00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:51.940\nThose things don't go on forever, those\nthings do expire at some point in time.\n\n234\n00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.070\nNow a certificate,\nwhen you have it, you have a choice.\n\n235\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:59.790\nWhen it comes to the end of life,\nit can be renewed before it expires,\n\n236\n00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.420\nmuch like a driver's license.\n\n237\n00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.660\nSo you can renew it before it expires.\n\n238\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:10.100\nYou can also just let it expire.\n\n239\n00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.930\nBut what happens if you got\na driver's license or something and\n\n240\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:14.970\nyou do something stupid?\n\n241\n00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:15.970\nThey can pull it.\n\n242\n00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.110\nThat's their choice.\n\n243\n00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.800\nThey can say, you're an idiot,\nhere you go, it's done.\n\n244\n00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.070\nYour done.\n\n245\n00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.980\nSo their revoking your license.\n\n246\n00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.460\nYou get the same thing\non a certificate and\n\n247\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.050\nwe do it because you don't need it\nanymore or because we can't trust you.\n\n248\n00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:34.500\nYou missed used it and if that's the case\nthen we have to let the people that\n\n249\n00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.360\nget your certificate or might encounter\nit, we have to let them know that, yeah,\n\n250\n00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.930\ndo not accept this person's\ncertificate because it's invalid.\n\n251\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.240\nYou know, it's like that thing\ndon't take checks from this person.\n\n252\n00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.740\nKinda like that, you know so.\n\n253\n00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.040\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, cuz you got, you know\na certificate has a validity period.\n\n254\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.700\nAnd there's times I need to end that\ncertificate's usefulness before\n\n255\n00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.620\nthe validity period ends, and I can't just\ngo reach out and take it back, right?\n\n256\n00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.600\nSo that's where this list comes\nin where I can say all right,\n\n257\n00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.820\nwe're adding this one to the list.\n\n258\n00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.780\nAnybody gets this certificate,\ndon't accept it, it's no good.\n\n259\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.330\n>> Yeah,\nthat's exactly what it's gonna be for.\n\n260\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:15.440\nIt's gonna check the normal things,\nthe certificate, does it check out?\n\n261\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.070\nIs it within it's validity period?\n\n262\n00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.340\nAll that good stuff.\n\n263\n00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.430\nAnd then one of the last checks\nit does is has it been revoked?\n\n264\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.640\nAnd so if it's been revoked you will\neither have a situation where your system,\n\n265\n00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.720\nwhen it encounters that certificate,\nit will throw up a warning on your screen,\n\n266\n00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.090\nsaying I'm not doing this.\n\n267\n00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.280\nThey might give you chance to continue,\nor it just might fail out and say, no.\n\n268\n00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.550\nThis is revoked, this needs to be fixed.\n\n269\n00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:48.340\nIf you see those warnings coming up and\nsee that it's been revoked.\n\n270\n00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:52.101\nIf you have any warning coming up with\nthe counter certificate for that matter,\n\n271\n00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:55.090\nyou should not be just be proceeding\non going, oh this is fine.\n\n272\n00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.460\nWhy is it getting that?\n\n273\n00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.449\nDo your research.\n\n274\n00:15:58.449 --> 00:16:00.894\n>> Wait wait wait, that red bar\nthat comes across on my browser,\n\n275\n00:16:00.894 --> 00:16:03.425\nI'm not supposed to put my credit\ncard number after I see that?\n\n276\n00:16:03.425 --> 00:16:04.328\n>> Oh, well that's fine.\n\n277\n00:16:04.328 --> 00:16:07.729\n>> Oh, okay, just checking.\n\n278\n00:16:07.729 --> 00:16:14.614\n>> But yeah, you definitely have to be\naware of that, that that could happen.\n\n279\n00:16:14.614 --> 00:16:15.648\nYou know, so.\n\n280\n00:16:15.648 --> 00:16:18.432\n>> The certificate is bad for\na reason right?\n\n281\n00:16:18.432 --> 00:16:21.530\nEither as you said,\nit's expired or it's been revoked.\n\n282\n00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.556\nAnd they don't just revoke it because\nthey felt like it, it was a good reason.\n\n283\n00:16:25.556 --> 00:16:26.390\n>> Yeah.\n>> Be careful,\n\n284\n00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:30.125\nif you see that warning,\ndo not put in your credit card.\n\n285\n00:16:30.125 --> 00:16:31.642\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n286\n00:16:31.642 --> 00:16:33.610\nthere's definitely a reason behind it.\n\n287\n00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:38.040\nNow, to be fair,\nit's not always a negative situation.\n\n288\n00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.330\nIt could be that a company\nissues certificates for\n\n289\n00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.110\nfour year periods at a time,\nyou could have a scenario like that,\n\n290\n00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.210\nand then someone who works for\nthe company for two years and then leaves.\n\n291\n00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.150\nThey're not gonna leave that\ncertificate in circulation.\n\n292\n00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.450\nThey'll revoke it.\n\n293\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:54.640\nIt's not a negative situation, they're\njust saying, this person's gone and\n\n294\n00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.470\nwe don't need that certificate\nbeing live anymore, re-pull it.\n\n295\n00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:01.950\nAnd so that's the end of that, but there's\nactually many more reasons why they're\n\n296\n00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:06.750\npulled for being non-trustworthy or\nmisused than there are for, hey, well,\n\n297\n00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.600\nthis person isn't around anymore.\n\n298\n00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.850\nSo that's just something to think about.\n\n299\n00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:13.530\nThat's what a CRL does.\n\n300\n00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.210\nAnd to be fair,\na CRL is an old way of doing it.\n\n301\n00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.570\nThey do have a new one,\nit's what OCSP or OSCP or,\n\n302\n00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.015\nI know there is an O in the beginning and\nP at the end.\n\n303\n00:17:24.015 --> 00:17:27.103\n>> Yeah, OCSP\n>> Yeah, you figure the few,\n\n304\n00:17:27.103 --> 00:17:29.994\nyou put it in whatever order\nyou feel is best for you.\n\n305\n00:17:29.994 --> 00:17:31.733\n>> This speeds up the process\na little bit, and\n\n306\n00:17:31.733 --> 00:17:34.130\nreduces the work load of\nchecking that reification list.\n\n307\n00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:38.540\n>> Yeah, it's more of,\ninstead of checking the list, it'll ping\n\n308\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:43.810\nthe certificate server and ask,\ndo you have any information on this?\n\n309\n00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:48.360\nAnd with the way things are now,\nit's much more efficient to do it\n\n310\n00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:53.076\nthat way than it is just to publish\nthe certificate or publish a CRL,\n\n311\n00:17:53.076 --> 00:17:58.911\nbecause CRL is by its very nature, when\nyou publish it, it's already gone stale.\n\n312\n00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:02.320\nBut using our other protocol,\nour newer one, we can fire that ping out.\n\n313\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.850\nWe can get it in real time.\n\n314\n00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:08.120\nAnd so we can know immediately that\ncertificate's no longer valid.\n\n315\n00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.070\n>> Which is important, right?\n\n316\n00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:13.760\nBecause somebody could try to use that\ncertificate even though it's been revoked.\n\n317\n00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.100\nLike a person gets their\nlicense suspended,\n\n318\n00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.100\nthey might still try to drive\nthat car until they get caught.\n\n319\n00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.385\nSo, that real time is nice.\n\n320\n00:18:21.385 --> 00:18:24.210\n>> Yeah, exactly, and\nthat's why they're using it.\n\n321\n00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.910\nBoth are still used, but we're seeing\na shift to the new protocol and\n\n322\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:28.880\naway from the CRL.\n\n323\n00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.258\nCRL's still being used for\nlegacy systems, but\n\n324\n00:18:31.258 --> 00:18:35.390\nyou'll see that as those systems go away,\nyou'll eventually see CRLs going away.\n\n325\n00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.090\nWho knows when that go away point is,\nbut it will happen.\n\n326\n00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.990\n>> And\nthen we get the certificates themselves.\n\n327\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:42.010\nWe've used that term a couple of times.\n\n328\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.430\nIs this something I can print out, Shaun?\n\n329\n00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.820\nIs it something I could frame,\nput on my wall?\n\n330\n00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.985\n>> You could, if you wanted.\n\n331\n00:18:46.985 --> 00:18:49.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You could definitely put it out but\n\n332\n00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.440\nit's really just like it says,\nit's a digital credential.\n\n333\n00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:00.500\nIt's really just a string of bits in the\ncomputer that can be uniquely validated.\n\n334\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.410\nThat's where hashing comes in.\n\n335\n00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:08.400\nIt has a unique signature applied to\nit to say what this credential is,\n\n336\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.960\nso we can validate that.\n\n337\n00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.670\nNow with digital certificates there's\ncertain information they have to have.\n\n338\n00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.398\nThere's certain information\nthat's optional.\n\n339\n00:19:17.398 --> 00:19:22.788\nTypically we have to be able to see things\nlike a serial number, a validity period,\n\n340\n00:19:22.788 --> 00:19:27.772\nthe issuer, a key, a signature,\nstuff like that we will see on it.\n\n341\n00:19:27.772 --> 00:19:29.920\nBut then other stuff that may be on it,\n\n342\n00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.790\nsometimes you'll see l an address of\nwhoever the person that was issued to.\n\n343\n00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.100\nYou'll see that in there.\n\n344\n00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.480\nI mean I think you can look\nat like Amazon's for example.\n\n345\n00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.385\nAnd they have their office up in Seattle,\nwhere they're up on it,\n\n346\n00:19:42.385 --> 00:19:46.869\nbut it doesn't really mean\nanything when you see that on it.\n\n347\n00:19:46.869 --> 00:19:50.630\nSo there's information that's optional,\nand information that's mandatory to have.\n\n348\n00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:55.183\nAnd so there's that, the other thing\nto remember about certificates is that\n\n349\n00:19:55.183 --> 00:19:57.786\ncertificates are actually standardized.\n\n350\n00:19:57.786 --> 00:20:04.229\nSo when you go within PKI, they go\nacross the board, they are standardized.\n\n351\n00:20:04.229 --> 00:20:07.469\nHowever, if you go to something like PGP,\n\n352\n00:20:07.469 --> 00:20:11.970\nPGP uses a different standard,\nexcept the newer version.\n\n353\n00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:16.000\nThe newer versions actually\nhave the ability to use some\n\n354\n00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.490\nof the stuff that standardized PKI uses.\n\n355\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.470\nThey have that too, but for\nthe most part we have PGP over here and\n\n356\n00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.680\nthe ones that use the PK over here,\nwas it x500?\n\n357\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.410\nWe have that standard out there and\neveryone adheres to that and\n\n358\n00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.208\nthat's why the system's interchangeable.\n\n359\n00:20:32.208 --> 00:20:35.260\nYou can use cross different\noperating systems and\n\n360\n00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.960\nall that because of that situation.\n\n361\n00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:44.310\n>> All right and then, the client's role\nin all of this, do we have a part to play?\n\n362\n00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.010\nYes, and\nit's usually gonna be transparent to you.\n\n363\n00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:54.302\nUnless there's a problem or\nyou specifically need to do something,\n\n364\n00:20:54.302 --> 00:21:01.353\nit's gonna be a situation where it is\ngonna be just completely transparent,\n\n365\n00:21:01.353 --> 00:21:07.117\nlike if we were to say just for\nargument's sake, use Windows.\n\n366\n00:21:07.117 --> 00:21:10.484\nWindows, when you open up\nInternet Explorer and go to a website,\n\n367\n00:21:10.484 --> 00:21:14.477\nor whatever browser you want and go to\na website, it presents a certificate.\n\n368\n00:21:14.477 --> 00:21:17.062\nYou never have to see it,\nyou just look across the top and\n\n369\n00:21:17.062 --> 00:21:18.831\nsee it's switched to an SSL session.\n\n370\n00:21:18.831 --> 00:21:22.314\nYou see a lock on the bottom.\n\n371\n00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:23.393\nThat's it, you know.\n\n372\n00:21:23.393 --> 00:21:26.090\nYou never had to think about it.\n\n373\n00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:31.500\nUnless a box came up and saying hey,\nby the way, this certificate's invalid,\n\n374\n00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.880\nthen you're going to have to\ndo a little more checking.\n\n375\n00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.230\nBut for the most part,\nit's completely transparent.\n\n376\n00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.710\nThere's actually an API, an interface in\nWindows that any application that needs to\n\n377\n00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:46.310\nbe PKI aware will plug into this crypto\nAPI, and the operating system itself\n\n378\n00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:51.400\nis querying a PKI whenever it's presented\nand doing the validation for you.\n\n379\n00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.820\nAnd then pass it on to\nthe client application.\n\n380\n00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.648\nOther then that you don't\nreally have to worry about it.\n\n381\n00:21:57.648 --> 00:22:03.720\nOnce you've enrolled, done, it's all\ntaken care of, and you're ready to go.\n\n382\n00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:09.230\nThat really is the nice part about it,\nthat's all seamless.\n\n383\n00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.281\nYour role is just doing\nwhatever you would need to do.\n\n384\n00:22:12.281 --> 00:22:15.885\nIf you want to go to a website and\nyou're buying something off Amazon, or\n\n385\n00:22:15.885 --> 00:22:18.910\nlogging into Gmail or whatever,\njust you can still do that.\n\n386\n00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.540\nIt's just, if you don't get any\nwarning messages and you're cool,\n\n387\n00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.990\nyou can log right in, no problem.\n\n388\n00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:27.070\n>> All right, so and\nonce we get that green bar or\n\n389\n00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:30.490\nthat whatever our particular\nfavorite browser happens to give us,\n\n390\n00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.930\nwe can pretty much trust that\nconnection is secure then.\n\n391\n00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:34.510\n>> Yes, you should be able.\n\n392\n00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.493\nI'm still a little paranoid.\n\n393\n00:22:36.493 --> 00:22:40.115\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like trust no one.\n\n394\n00:22:40.115 --> 00:22:41.439\nTrust, but verify.\n\n395\n00:22:41.439 --> 00:22:42.880\n>> Trust, but verify.\n\n396\n00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.950\n>> There's still little hacks and stuff\nlike that you can use to get around stuff.\n\n397\n00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:48.759\nThere always is.\n\n398\n00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:54.200\nBut for\nthe most part you should be just fine.\n\n399\n00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.471\nYou're going to Amazon's site or\nGmail's site or what have you,\n\n400\n00:22:58.471 --> 00:23:00.467\nyou're good, you're good.\n\n401\n00:23:00.467 --> 00:23:03.242\nIf it validates and\nyou don't get any warnings, you're fine.\n\n402\n00:23:03.242 --> 00:23:07.751\n>> From a management perspective and\nbringing back into the CASP,\n\n403\n00:23:07.751 --> 00:23:11.008\nwe're deciding whether\nwe want to go public or\n\n404\n00:23:11.008 --> 00:23:15.600\nuse a bot or Verisign,\none of those companies, versus private,\n\n405\n00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:21.190\ninternally or some sort of combination\nthereof and things like that.\n\n406\n00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:25.402\n>> That would be a discussion that\nyou would be having as a manager or\n\n407\n00:23:25.402 --> 00:23:29.616\nsomeone that is the intended audience for\nsomething like this.\n\n408\n00:23:29.616 --> 00:23:33.663\nThat's probably the decision you would be\nmaking is, or one decision you have input\n\n409\n00:23:33.663 --> 00:23:37.777\ninto it as least, is whether or not you're\ngonna go with a solely internal solution.\n\n410\n00:23:37.777 --> 00:23:40.584\nOr if you're going to go\nto an external solution and\n\n411\n00:23:40.584 --> 00:23:42.810\ntry to figure out what the reasons are.\n\n412\n00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:43.980\nIt would be for both.\n\n413\n00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.980\nI mean you could go with the external one\nfor things like VPNs and stuff like that.\n\n414\n00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.540\nThat may be a 100% what\nyou want to go with.\n\n415\n00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.830\nInternally for sending emails you may just\nwant to use one for that and just have it.\n\n416\n00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.730\nGo with those sorts of things.\n\n417\n00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.730\nThen you even have stuff\nlike in Microsoft's world,\n\n418\n00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:04.100\nyou have stuff like their RMS technology.\n\n419\n00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.830\nIt relies on certificates and\n\n420\n00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:11.295\nthat stuff is never gonna cross\nthe border of your network.\n\n421\n00:24:11.295 --> 00:24:16.946\nThere's things and all that with it,\nwe're not gonna worry about here.\n\n422\n00:24:16.946 --> 00:24:20.878\nBut that requires one for that, so\nyou've got to figure out what's the best\n\n423\n00:24:20.878 --> 00:24:24.504\nsolution, whether you're going\nto go commercial, whether you're\n\n424\n00:24:24.504 --> 00:24:29.116\ngoing to go internal, what your budget is,\nwhat your management overhead's gonna be,\n\n425\n00:24:29.116 --> 00:24:31.842\nand there's always gonna\nbe management overhead.\n\n426\n00:24:31.842 --> 00:24:33.224\nThen you gotta decide,\n\n427\n00:24:33.224 --> 00:24:37.880\nis this something you really need to\nbump things up to the next level.\n\n428\n00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.290\nQuite a few companies are really doing\nthis now because things like digital\n\n429\n00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:47.190\nsignatures, they're figuring it's going\nto cut down on things like spamming and\n\n430\n00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:51.821\nspoofing and stuff like that, because\nof the very nature of this technology.\n\n431\n00:24:51.821 --> 00:24:54.353\n>> We're seeing more and\nmore smart cards being utilized.\n\n432\n00:24:54.353 --> 00:24:58.040\nThe military and things like that,\nthat's all relying on certificates right?\n\n433\n00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.250\n>> Yeah, and then you're getting more and\nmore with mobile devices and\n\n434\n00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:02.800\nstuff like that.\n\n435\n00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.200\nThat's increasing\nthe usage of certificates.\n\n436\n00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.665\nYou get a whole bunch of things that\nare just gonna start coming into play\n\n437\n00:25:09.665 --> 00:25:10.191\nbig time.\n\n438\n00:25:10.191 --> 00:25:11.724\n>> Yeah, all right.\n\n439\n00:25:11.724 --> 00:25:12.698\nWell, again, Shawn,\n\n440\n00:25:12.698 --> 00:25:16.030\nfantastic information when it comes to\nthe world of public key infrastructure.\n\n441\n00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:19.740\nSo anything else we need to throw\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n442\n00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:25.310\n>> Except to say that DKI is something\nthat you really got to get a grasp on.\n\n443\n00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.558\nAnd this was the primer on it.\n\n444\n00:25:27.558 --> 00:25:28.454\n>> I know, right.\n\n445\n00:25:28.454 --> 00:25:29.388\n>> But not the setup.\n\n446\n00:25:29.388 --> 00:25:34.089\nI know that there's stuff in the library\nand other courses that do cover that,\n\n447\n00:25:34.089 --> 00:25:37.664\nif you wanna get in to the Microsoft,\nPreside or whatever.\n\n448\n00:25:37.664 --> 00:25:44.600\nBut what we have here, is the stuff you\nneed to know, no matter where you go.\n\n449\n00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.840\nMicrosoft, wherever,\nyou need to know this type of stuff.\n\n450\n00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.110\nIt's gonna be a big, big deal,\ncuz you don't necessarily care what's\n\n451\n00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:55.562\nbehind the curtain,\njust that it does these things, for us.\n\n452\n00:25:55.562 --> 00:25:57.447\n>> All right, well ladies and gentleman,\n\n453\n00:25:57.447 --> 00:26:00.884\nthat brings us to the end of another\nfantastic episode, so signing off for\n\n454\n00:26:00.884 --> 00:26:03.372\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n455\n00:26:03.372 --> 00:26:04.428\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n456\n00:26:04.428 --> 00:26:08.631\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:15.700\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.630\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.970\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.490\n>> I'm doing great, can't complain.\n\n7\n00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.170\nHere we are doing our CASP episodes.\n\n8\n00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.520\nOur CompTIA advanced\nsecurity practitioner.\n\n9\n00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.890\nAnd in today's episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at cryptographic solutions.\n\n10\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.530\nWe've seen in our previous episodes,\n\n11\n00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.400\nwe talked a lot about cryptography in\ngeneral, different types of cryptography,\n\n12\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.120\nwhere we see it, the goals of\ncryptography, things like that.\n\n13\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.950\nNow we're gonna see how we\nactually put it in place and\n\n14\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.180\nuse it to design a secure network.\n\n15\n00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.400\n>> Yeah, when you look at cryptography,\nthere's just so\n\n16\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.170\nmany ways you can either use it on\nits own or you can mix and match.\n\n17\n00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.010\nAnd that's the real magic with\ncryptography, as far as that's concerned.\n\n18\n00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.580\nYou can use things like symmetric on its\nown, asymmetric on its own, hashing.\n\n19\n00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.346\nAnd each one of those provides something\nindividually that's very good.\n\n20\n00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:12.778\nAnd all of them do some things well,\nother things, they don't do well at all,\n\n21\n00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:15.127\nor some of the things,\nthey just don't do outright.\n\n22\n00:01:15.127 --> 00:01:16.581\nIn the case of hashing,\n\n23\n00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:20.960\nwe learned that hashing doesn't do\nanything to conceal information.\n\n24\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.840\nBut it has its own role that\nthe other ones can't fulfill.\n\n25\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.890\nSo, every form of cryptography\nhas something that provides that\n\n26\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.770\nthe other ones don't.\n\n27\n00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.916\nWhat we're looking at with cryptographics\nsolutions is just different ways we\n\n28\n00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:42.291\ncan combine those things to get something\nthat is gonna address a certain problem or\n\n29\n00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:43.539\nscenario we have.\n\n30\n00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.629\nAnd it seems like even though you have\njust those three things of asymmetric,\n\n31\n00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:50.444\nsymmetric, and hashing.\n\n32\n00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:54.446\nIt seems like there's an endless\nnumber of combinations and\n\n33\n00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:57.850\napplications that they can use them for.\n\n34\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.036\nIt's amazing the way those\nthings have come together.\n\n35\n00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:03.590\nSo, even though [LAUGH] we're gonna\ntalk about a few solutions here,\n\n36\n00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.940\nit's really not the end game by any means,\nas far as that whole deal goes.\n\n37\n00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.250\n>> Yeah,\nyou really see it everywhere you look.\n\n38\n00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.150\nWe use it to secure data at\nrest in forms of encryption,\n\n39\n00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.910\nlike what NTFS provides or\nsome other third party program.\n\n40\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.300\nWe see it protecting data in motion.\n\n41\n00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.770\nWe look at things like IPsec and\ndifferent VPN tunneling technologies.\n\n42\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.030\nWe see it being used to\nmake secure emails, for\n\n43\n00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.640\nexample, to give us that non-repudiation\nand that data integrity.\n\n44\n00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.700\nEvery time you go online and\nyou go shopping, and you see that https or\n\n45\n00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.450\nthat secure webpage,\nwhether it's SSL or TLS.\n\n46\n00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.670\nThat's using encryption in the background\non all those techniques that Sean has\n\n47\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.340\ndiscussed over these last few episodes.\n\n48\n00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.411\nI mean, you really don't have to look far\nto find encryption in your workplace and\n\n49\n00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:54.066\nsee where it fits into\nthe design of a secure network,\n\n50\n00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:56.372\ndepending on what you're\ntrying to protect.\n\n51\n00:02:56.372 --> 00:02:57.591\n>> Yeah, not at all.\n\n52\n00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:03.410\nThere's just so many things it's used in,\nso many places that you'll find it.\n\n53\n00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.940\nI mean,\nyou look at the online aspect of it,\n\n54\n00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.240\nit's all over the place and that's only\ngonna increase as we see more [LAUGH] and\n\n55\n00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.800\nmore security issues come into play.\n\n56\n00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.625\nYou're gonna see encryption take\na bigger and bigger and bigger role.\n\n57\n00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:24.140\nWe've already seen it in the case\nof SSL where it's a big player.\n\n58\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.410\nAnd in fact, SSL just doesn't happen\n\n59\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.670\nwithout cryptographic\ntechnologies being part of it.\n\n60\n00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.275\nSo, we see that being used more and more.\n\n61\n00:03:33.275 --> 00:03:37.419\nOr you actually see places like Google\nprioritizing results if they're encrypted.\n\n62\n00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.980\nSo, it's encouraging more people to\nuse those as part of their website, or\n\n63\n00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.140\nwhatever application they have.\n\n64\n00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.220\nAnd then you can even step out\nof those environments, and\n\n65\n00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.780\nstep into the every day stuff for\ncryptography.\n\n66\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.000\nStuff that you actually\nmay have to run into.\n\n67\n00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.307\nStuff like, if you work in anything\nthat supports a retail environment,\n\n68\n00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:02.711\nthose machines that they swipe\nyour credit card through,\n\n69\n00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:05.356\nthose don't happen without cryptography.\n\n70\n00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:09.242\n[LAUGH] They've actually found some\nloopholes with those recently,\n\n71\n00:04:09.242 --> 00:04:13.195\nwhich they found out, believe it or\nnot, that we use cryptography and\n\n72\n00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:15.942\nall those things,\npretty strong stuff too, but\n\n73\n00:04:15.942 --> 00:04:19.833\nthose things are configured by\na vendor and then sent out someplace.\n\n74\n00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:23.294\nThis should be a lesson to all of you,\nwhen they audited those machines,\n\n75\n00:04:23.294 --> 00:04:25.734\nthey found about 90% of\nthem use the same codes,\n\n76\n00:04:25.734 --> 00:04:27.751\nwhich was only like two of them out there.\n\n77\n00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:30.571\nSo, chances are, you could find\nit online and punch in stuff and\n\n78\n00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:31.600\nbust into the system.\n\n79\n00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.094\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n80\n00:04:33.094 --> 00:04:34.525\n>> I know what I'm gonna\nbe doing this afternoon.\n\n81\n00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:35.235\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n82\n00:04:35.235 --> 00:04:37.105\n>> Just kidding [LAUGH].\n\n83\n00:04:37.105 --> 00:04:41.035\n>> Stop by the Outback and shove steak,\nand go get yourself money.\n\n84\n00:04:41.035 --> 00:04:42.564\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's like an ATM.\n\n85\n00:04:42.564 --> 00:04:44.166\n>> [LAUGH] Dinner tonight is on you guys.\n\n86\n00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:49.866\n>> [LAUGH] Look at me\nmentioning the Outback.\n\n87\n00:04:49.866 --> 00:04:50.656\nI'm trying to get a free steak.\n\n88\n00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:54.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But those machines,\n\n89\n00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.350\nthey use cryptography as\npart of their solution.\n\n90\n00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.810\nThose just don't happen.\n\n91\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.070\nBut then we have the credit\ncards that go through those.\n\n92\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.790\nWe have things that the firmware updates,\nand stuff like that,\n\n93\n00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.420\nyou have for hardware.\n\n94\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.160\nThat's part of it.\n\n95\n00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.100\nYour smartphones use those things to\nmake sure that certain things happen and\n\n96\n00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.079\ngenuine stuff gets into them.\n\n97\n00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:19.403\nYou have them in your cars, well,\nyou're supposed to have them in your cars.\n\n98\n00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:22.460\nKind of wonder some of this\nstuff we've heard recently.\n\n99\n00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.620\nI'm sure there's probably a number of\nyou out there have heard of a Chrysler,\n\n100\n00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.270\nor somebody else got their\nJeeps hacked last week.\n\n101\n00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.410\n>> I haven't heard that one.\n\n102\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.520\n>> Yeah, they did it.\n\n103\n00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.314\nThey had someone cruising down the road,\nas a demo had someone from not even there,\n\n104\n00:05:38.314 --> 00:05:42.576\nnot even next to them, hack them from\na distance and put them off the road.\n\n105\n00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:43.493\n>> Really?\n\n106\n00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:45.280\nWow, that's scary.\n\n107\n00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.253\n>> Yeah, that's how I'm gonna beat\neverybody in my like, '82 YouGo.\n\n108\n00:05:48.253 --> 00:05:49.680\nJust start hacking stuff.\n\n109\n00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.479\n[LAUGH] We can't keep up with him.\n\n110\n00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:58.213\n[LAUGH] So you see it in those places too.\n\n111\n00:05:58.213 --> 00:06:02.520\nSo, it's literally in just almost\nevery place you're gonna look.\n\n112\n00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.881\nYou're gonna see cryptography pop\nup in there in some combination,\n\n113\n00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:10.555\nin some mixture that's\ngonna make things happen.\n\n114\n00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:13.605\nProbably the trickiest thing,\nthough, is getting it right.\n\n115\n00:06:14.995 --> 00:06:16.565\nThat's why [LAUGH] we're\ngoing through all this.\n\n116\n00:06:16.565 --> 00:06:21.750\nThat's why we have this whole\nprimer in this credential,\n\n117\n00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.670\nand they have it in things like the CSSP,\nthat's why we talked about ethical\n\n118\n00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.730\nhacking and forensics because it's\none thing to say that cryptographic\n\n119\n00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.370\ntechnologies play a big role,\nit's quite another to do it correctly.\n\n120\n00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.566\nIf you don't do it correctly,\nthings are going to go really bad for you.\n\n121\n00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:42.850\nAuto manufacturers learned\nthat several years ago,\n\n122\n00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.120\nway prior to this thing\nthat happened last week.\n\n123\n00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.073\nFor some reason they found\nout that a 48 bit or\n\n124\n00:06:51.073 --> 00:06:55.552\na 56 bit key on their cars was not\na good idea, even they were warned.\n\n125\n00:06:55.552 --> 00:06:59.150\nThey said oh, no, 56 bit,\nthat's a lot that's more than 50.\n\n126\n00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.790\n[LAUGH] That's this many.\n\n127\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.528\n>> Didn't learn anything from WEP or\nany of that, right?\n\n128\n00:07:05.528 --> 00:07:08.069\n>> No, they didn't learn at all when\nthey started putting those keyless\n\n129\n00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:08.906\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n130\n00:07:08.906 --> 00:07:10.842\n>> entry systems in cars and\n\n131\n00:07:10.842 --> 00:07:17.490\nthey were very easily broken, and they had\ncases of people stealing cars out of them.\n\n132\n00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.830\nThey were warned, but\n\n133\n00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.290\nyou had a case of engineers not listening\nto somebody that knew the technology.\n\n134\n00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.180\nSo, it's actually good that when\nyou go through something like this,\n\n135\n00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.550\nand we talk about cryptography and\ntalk about the solutions.\n\n136\n00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.700\nYeah, you could put these things together,\nbut you got to use the right stuff to\n\n137\n00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.450\nactually do it, otherwise,\na solution that might look nice and\n\n138\n00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.270\npretty on paper is gonna get cut\napart like a knife in butter.\n\n139\n00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.730\nSo, you just don't want\nto have that happen.\n\n140\n00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.930\n>> All right, so what are some of the ways\nthat we can put these things into place\n\n141\n00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.440\nand make our network strong because\nI had a good, strong, secure network.\n\n142\n00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.750\n>> Well, you got plenty of options there.\n\n143\n00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.654\nIf you wanna protect data in transit,\nyou have things SSL and TLS and And\n\n144\n00:08:01.654 --> 00:08:06.885\nIPSec of course, and IPSecs one of those\nones that has a lot of variations and\n\n145\n00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:12.366\ncombinations you could put in to\nauthenticate data, to do non-repudiation,\n\n146\n00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:17.550\nall the stuff we talked about being\nthe core goals of cryptography.\n\n147\n00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.530\nThen we have, plenty of other\nstuff too that goes in there, so\n\n148\n00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.960\nwe have things like SSL, TLS,\nIPSec and stuff like that.\n\n149\n00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.440\nThen you have it where\ntechnologies like VPNs,\n\n150\n00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.460\nVPNs just don't happen without\nencryption of some sort.\n\n151\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.720\nThose things would fall\napart very quickly.\n\n152\n00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.555\nAnd then we have digital certificates\nthose are gone if we don't have those.\n\n153\n00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:41.945\nSo there's some really big,\n\n154\n00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:46.285\nreally big areas that they're\ngonna to play a huge role in.\n\n155\n00:08:46.285 --> 00:08:50.145\nAnd that's just kind of some of the data\nin transit as you were talking about,\n\n156\n00:08:50.145 --> 00:08:51.990\njust moving around.\n\n157\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:56.340\nWe're not even getting to the point where\nthey are encrypting hard drives, and\n\n158\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.150\nflash drives, and all that stuff.\n\n159\n00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.000\nThat's becoming a very hot topic area.\n\n160\n00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.793\nAs they realize these things do get\nstolen, or get lost, or misplaced or what\n\n161\n00:09:06.793 --> 00:09:11.835\nhave you, they end up in someone else's\nhands that wasn't the original owner.\n\n162\n00:09:11.835 --> 00:09:17.838\nAnd now someone's got access to everything\nand that causes a huge problem so you\n\n163\n00:09:17.838 --> 00:09:24.120\nstart where drive encryption was something\nthat was kinda of on the fringe before.\n\n164\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.308\nWe saw a few people using it,\nnow it's becoming more and more and\n\n165\n00:09:27.308 --> 00:09:31.265\nmore popular where you're seeing,\nwhole drive encryption being used and then\n\n166\n00:09:31.265 --> 00:09:35.350\nyou're seeing even go out to smartphones\nand stuff like that and tablets.\n\n167\n00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.680\nPeople are realizing that\nthose features are there.\n\n168\n00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:44.386\nAnd now they have to really understand\nthat's something that you have to use,\n\n169\n00:09:44.386 --> 00:09:48.022\nbecause you can lose those\ndevices quite easily.\n\n170\n00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:52.050\nSmaller it gets, the easier it is for\nyou to be like oh, where'd it go?\n\n171\n00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.080\nAnd you're in big trouble at that point.\n\n172\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:02.180\nSo yeah, that's the transit and\nthe data at rest.\n\n173\n00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.674\nThen we have stuff to another area\nthat's gonna be used more, and more, and\n\n174\n00:10:06.674 --> 00:10:09.004\nmore is digital signatures, as well.\n\n175\n00:10:09.004 --> 00:10:14.075\nDigital signatures We know,\nwere things like SSL,combines\n\n176\n00:10:14.075 --> 00:10:18.568\nasymmetric and\nsymmetric to come about its solution.\n\n177\n00:10:18.568 --> 00:10:23.192\nYou look at something like digital\nsignatures that are combining,\n\n178\n00:10:23.192 --> 00:10:25.878\nasymmetric plus hashing to do its job.\n\n179\n00:10:25.878 --> 00:10:30.728\nAnd that gives us all those nice things,\nlike non-repudiation,\n\n180\n00:10:30.728 --> 00:10:34.634\nauthentication and\nintegrity gives us those three.\n\n181\n00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:39.422\nAnd companies are really jumping on\nthose because all the bogus emails that\n\n182\n00:10:39.422 --> 00:10:44.050\nhave gone around, phishing attacks,\nall those things.\n\n183\n00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.480\nSpoofing of emails, they're just kinda\nstarting to say enough is enough.\n\n184\n00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.540\nYou're seeing more and\nmore companies implement those and\n\n185\n00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.050\nthat would even go back to and\n\n186\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:57.110\naddress part of the thing we had yesterday\nwe said about certification authorities.\n\n187\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.350\nWhy would someone go\nexternal versus internal?\n\n188\n00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.430\nYou might wanna have digital signatures\nimplemented across the board for everyone\n\n189\n00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:10.530\ninside the company so you can really\nverify in a positive sense who someone is.\n\n190\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.200\nAnd heck, they're even putting those\ndigital signatures on those documents for\n\n191\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.070\nthings like emails and such and such.\n\n192\n00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:22.270\nOr even incorporating those into smart\ncards, because it's becoming such a more\n\n193\n00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.910\nvaluable area to use this stuff in,\nit's so important.\n\n194\n00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.020\n>> It does seem like encryption is\nsomething that we don't look at as\n\n195\n00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.780\nan optional thing, or only something\nwe use on our very sensitive data.\n\n196\n00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.310\nIt's something that we use everywhere.\n\n197\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.205\nIt's easier, we're seeing that\njust put this in place I guess.\n\n198\n00:11:39.205 --> 00:11:40.615\nI guess the technology's getting better.\n\n199\n00:11:40.615 --> 00:11:43.777\nThe processor's are getting better so\nit doesn't take as big a performance hit.\n\n200\n00:11:43.777 --> 00:11:46.975\nBut yeah it's getting to the point where\neverything's got a digital signature.\n\n201\n00:11:46.975 --> 00:11:48.755\nEverything is encrypted.\n\n202\n00:11:48.755 --> 00:11:51.775\nLike you were talking about just\nmy Google search is encrypted.\n\n203\n00:11:51.775 --> 00:11:55.165\nSo we're seeing it just more and\nmore become commonplace or\n\n204\n00:11:55.165 --> 00:11:58.245\nnormal rather than the exceptions.\n\n205\n00:11:58.245 --> 00:12:01.865\n>> Yeah absolutely and the reason why\nwe're just throwing a bunch of these\n\n206\n00:12:01.865 --> 00:12:05.681\nthings out there is this is just\nsomething you're not gonna get away from.\n\n207\n00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:09.286\nAnd that's one of the things they\nemphasize in this credential is that\n\n208\n00:12:09.286 --> 00:12:12.277\nthey've really, this is one of the,\nwhen you look at it,\n\n209\n00:12:12.277 --> 00:12:15.908\none of the few credentials that\nactually emphasizes on a large scale.\n\n210\n00:12:15.908 --> 00:12:21.355\nWe're talking a whole section of the exam,\nyou're talking a large\n\n211\n00:12:21.355 --> 00:12:26.515\nportion of it is going to\nconcentrate on cryptography itself.\n\n212\n00:12:26.515 --> 00:12:30.410\nThen there's gonna be other areas\nit pops up in and you're so\n\n213\n00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.680\nyou're just not gonna get away from it.\n\n214\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.460\nSo this is kind of to let you know\nthat yeah, there's some things that\n\n215\n00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.430\nprobably most IP people are familiar\nwith the SSLs and digital signatures,\n\n216\n00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:44.960\nbut there's plenty of other areas\nwhere it's just creeping around and\n\n217\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.165\nsense it's transparent,\nyou don't tend to think about it.\n\n218\n00:12:48.165 --> 00:12:50.950\nAnd that's a good thing\nthat it's transparent,\n\n219\n00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.830\nbecause you don't want people to get all,\nyou know screwy,\n\n220\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.450\nand messed up by seeing all these,\nyou know bits and whatever flying around.\n\n221\n00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.200\nYou wanna see it in the background but\nit's definitely there,\n\n222\n00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.290\neven if you're not thinking about it.\n\n223\n00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.140\nIt's definitely there,\n\n224\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.850\nin just about everything you're running\ninto and That's only gonna increase.\n\n225\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.700\nIt's not gonna be a safer world.\n\n226\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.455\nIt's not becoming a more trusting world.\n\n227\n00:13:11.455 --> 00:13:14.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's something that we need\n\n228\n00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.500\nto really take seriously and\nincorporate it.\n\n229\n00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.247\nConsider the fact that when\nwe start talking about things\n\n230\n00:13:21.247 --> 00:13:25.631\nlike enterprise solutions and\ncloud hosting and stuff like that.\n\n231\n00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:31.754\nAll the stuff we're talking about here\nis gonna pop up again over there.\n\n232\n00:13:31.754 --> 00:13:35.249\nFor a lot of cases, you can't just\ntake your stuff from your company and\n\n233\n00:13:35.249 --> 00:13:37.730\nshove it up in the cloud and\nsay, okay, done.\n\n234\n00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.700\nPat yourself on the back and\nsay nice day's work.\n\n235\n00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.990\nNo there's much more than that.\n\n236\n00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:46.270\nIts not like you're just throwing stuff up\nin Dropbox you know some personal stuff,\n\n237\n00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:50.120\nyou actually have to put your data\nup there in a corporate sense.\n\n238\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.610\nYou have to do different\nlevels of encryption.\n\n239\n00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:58.180\nAnd those be dictated by regulations,\nboth federal, state, and even local ones.\n\n240\n00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.060\nAnd if you're in a regulated industry,\nthat's even gonna go on top of that.\n\n241\n00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.252\nAnd so those are things that they may not\n\n242\n00:14:05.252 --> 00:14:09.424\ndirectly hit you with in\nsaying you shall use this.\n\n243\n00:14:09.424 --> 00:14:13.163\nBut you better know that this is\nsomething that you're gonna have to use.\n\n244\n00:14:13.163 --> 00:14:18.390\nAnd then once that comes into play, what\nstrengths and all that do you have to use.\n\n245\n00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.880\n>> All right so we need to make sure we're\naware of obviously the solutions that we\n\n246\n00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.370\nhave available.\n\n247\n00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.720\nAs well as where we want to\nimplement those solutions and\n\n248\n00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.000\nthen what level of protection\nthey're gonna provide.\n\n249\n00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.210\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n250\n00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.547\nYou're not gonna get away with that, or\n\n251\n00:14:33.547 --> 00:14:38.610\nget through this successfully\nwithout knowing this.\n\n252\n00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.270\nSo, just from a legal sense,\nfrom implementation sense, and\n\n253\n00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.780\na technical sense, you have to know it.\n\n254\n00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:51.140\nAnd like I said, it's not changing as\nfar as the technology that's coming out.\n\n255\n00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.670\nIt's getting to be in everything,\n\n256\n00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.035\nyou can even find it in kids'\ntoys if you can believe that.\n\n257\n00:14:56.035 --> 00:14:58.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Some of these kids' toys,\n\n258\n00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.650\nthey've got it so you can't alter\nsource code or anything in it.\n\n259\n00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:10.080\nCuz kids' toys are really gone digital,\nand they've done a lot of stuff.\n\n260\n00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.125\nAnd they make those so\nyou can't get away from encryption there.\n\n261\n00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:15.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm not saying that you're probably\n\n262\n00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:21.610\nsetting up a bunch of kids' toys,\nbut it just shows how common it is.\n\n263\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:25.081\nSo it's not just your technology,\nit's all over the place, too.\n\n264\n00:15:25.081 --> 00:15:31.066\nAnd so, heck, I even got one of my things\nhere just to kind of show you another,\n\n265\n00:15:31.066 --> 00:15:33.260\nI'm just showing off here.\n\n266\n00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:38.580\n[LAUGH] This is to show you another\narea where this is actually used.\n\n267\n00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:43.052\nThis is a device that,\nI just got this a couple weeks ago this is\n\n268\n00:15:43.052 --> 00:15:47.868\nsomething called a Wocket, and\nwhat it is it's a digital wallet,\n\n269\n00:15:47.868 --> 00:15:51.840\nand it actually has encrypted\nstorage on this device.\n\n270\n00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.485\nAnd so, when you hit the button on it,\n\n271\n00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:59.300\nyou can see it's got a little pin pad\non it so I can put my pin code in it.\n\n272\n00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.210\nActually it also has,\nyou an do voice activated with this too.\n\n273\n00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.800\nIt's got biometric stuff on it.\n\n274\n00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.920\nSo if you really want to sound cool and\ntalk to your wallet.\n\n275\n00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.743\nAfter they institutionalize you,\nyou can tell them.\n\n276\n00:16:11.743 --> 00:16:15.390\n[LAUGH] So this relies very,\nvery heavily on encryption.\n\n277\n00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:21.000\nThis thing you can scan in at least\n\n278\n00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.920\na thousand credit cards, membership cards,\nstuff like that, any combination you want.\n\n279\n00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.470\nThey said at least a 1,000.\n\n280\n00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.530\nI don't know what the upper number is.\n\n281\n00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.888\nI do not have that many of those cards.\n\n282\n00:16:31.888 --> 00:16:33.281\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n283\n00:16:33.281 --> 00:16:36.510\nthis is something that they put out.\n\n284\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:40.640\nAnd you can see how this\nkinda relies on cryptography,\n\n285\n00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.310\nnot only if I scanned my credit cards and\nmy membership cards in here,\n\n286\n00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.660\nwhat I do to use this is what once I put\nthe PIN code in something like this,\n\n287\n00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.990\nit asks me, because I've\nscanned the cards in, it says,\n\n288\n00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:56.900\nokay, you've unlocked the device\nwhat do you wanna use to pay for\n\n289\n00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.190\nthis transaction or\nwhat membership card do you wanna use?\n\n290\n00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.760\nI choose it off a list and\nit will tell me, okay,\n\n291\n00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.190\nthis is the one you wanna use,\nlet's say yeah.\n\n292\n00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:09.010\nI hit the button and\nit will actually code a card in here.\n\n293\n00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.790\nThis thing actually has a physical\ncard believe it or not.\n\n294\n00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:16.680\nThis is something that once you go through\nand punch in your code in here and\n\n295\n00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.710\ntell it which payment card you wanna use.\n\n296\n00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.200\n>> Mhm.\n>> It actually uniquely codes,\n\n297\n00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.520\nit uses digital signatures and all that,\nto actually code it directly on the card.\n\n298\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.490\nSo now I can choose the card,\nhave this programmed, pull the card out,\n\n299\n00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:29.800\nswipe it through.\n\n300\n00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.870\nOnce I swipe it through,\nit's one time use.\n\n301\n00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.510\nFor me to actually use this again,\nI have to put it back in here and\n\n302\n00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.390\nchoose a selected again.\n\n303\n00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:43.040\nSo that's a pretty powerful\ntechnology when you look at it.\n\n304\n00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.270\nAnd this actually does rely,\nit's actually a,\n\n305\n00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:50.810\nif you look at the back you can see\na little gold contacts on there, so\n\n306\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.860\nit's actually using that\nto code this whole thing.\n\n307\n00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.530\nSo it relies, this thing wouldn't\nexist without cryptography.\n\n308\n00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.730\nIt just plain simple wouldn't\nexist there's just no other way\n\n309\n00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:07.525\nto phrase that and they've made it in such\na way that it's even tied directly to you.\n\n310\n00:18:07.525 --> 00:18:13.120\nWhen you order something like this,\nthey code it to you and once you get it,\n\n311\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.080\nif someone else was to get a hold\nof this before I swipe my cards in,\n\n312\n00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.120\nthey've put signatures and\neverything else all over this, and\n\n313\n00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.510\nI have to actually swipe my own\ncredit cards in, or debit cards in or\n\n314\n00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:28.760\nwhat have you, to prove that I'm\nthe legitimate owner of this.\n\n315\n00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.490\nIt wont work with anyone else.\n\n316\n00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:34.840\nSo even if you got a device that was\nintercepted the shipment, try to do it,\n\n317\n00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.611\nand encryption comes in and says nope,\nI've got that all stored on here.\n\n318\n00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:42.930\nAnd boom it's only gonna work for Sean so,\n\n319\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.040\nif I gotta put my credit card through,\nthat's it.\n\n320\n00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.580\n>> Nice.\n\n321\n00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:51.220\n>> And so, it's a very cool\ntechnology to take a look at.\n\n322\n00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.880\nThey're still pretty new.\n\n323\n00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.970\nBut if you guys\nare interested in this thing,\n\n324\n00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.580\nit is called a Wocket,\nit's like pocket with a w.\n\n325\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.540\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n326\n00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.240\n>> But you can get them actually now.\n\n327\n00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.250\nActually, I think they're\nactually back ordered.\n\n328\n00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.900\nBut they're not cheap, by the way.\n\n329\n00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.430\nThey're about $230, $240.\n\n330\n00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.410\nBut come one, it's cool.\n\n331\n00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:14.390\nLook at that.\n>> [LAUGH] So not only is this encryption\n\n332\n00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.410\nand cryptography techniques\nsecuring what we already have,\n\n333\n00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.130\nit's making new things possible.\n\n334\n00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.070\nThings that we weren't able to do before.\n\n335\n00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.180\n>> Yeah, absolutely and\nthat's just one way,\n\n336\n00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.580\na new way they've combined these\ntechnologies to get a solution.\n\n337\n00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:37.110\nAnd when I saw that I thought,\noh heck that was pretty cool just\n\n338\n00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:42.000\nhearing about it, but the fact that I can\nactually store everything on there and\n\n339\n00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.800\ncarry that around instead\nof my wallet if I want.\n\n340\n00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.090\n>> Mh-mm.\n\n341\n00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:48.730\n>> That's really neat.\n\n342\n00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.170\nI don't have to carry a big bulky wallet.\n\n343\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:55.970\nI could just shove my photo ID in\nthere and I've got everything else.\n\n344\n00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.120\nAnd it does work,\nI've tried it out several times.\n\n345\n00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.970\nIt works seamlessly.\n\n346\n00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.970\n>> Can you scan in papers and\nstuff like that?\n\n347\n00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.010\nCuz I know Jason's\nwallet's about that fat.\n\n348\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.320\nI don't think there's any way.\n\n349\n00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.357\nHe might need three of those.\n\n350\n00:20:08.357 --> 00:20:11.021\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n351\n00:20:11.021 --> 00:20:13.572\n>> You need to calm it down, all right?\n\n352\n00:20:13.572 --> 00:20:14.350\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n353\n00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.088\n>> So very cool.\n\n354\n00:20:15.088 --> 00:20:16.510\nThey're very cool.\n\n355\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.080\n>> It's just one more\nthing that's out there.\n\n356\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.320\nIt's pretty neat.\n\n357\n00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.480\nBut just shows you all these different\n\n358\n00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.340\nareas that cryptographic\ntechnology are going into.\n\n359\n00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:31.430\nWe haven't gotten to things like\nauthentication all that yet directly.\n\n360\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:36.040\nEven though when we did our Kaley course,\n\n361\n00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:41.730\nwe did Metasploit, we did our pin testing,\nand our forensics course.\n\n362\n00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.900\nWe did all those things.\n\n363\n00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.990\nCryptography was involved in all of that.\n\n364\n00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:55.020\nEvery last one it showed up in, and one\nof the areas it showed up in was, aside\n\n365\n00:20:55.020 --> 00:21:00.570\nfrom the stuff we already talked about,\nit showed up in authentication systems.\n\n366\n00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:05.595\nIf you recall, when I was doing\n\n367\n00:21:05.595 --> 00:21:10.760\nthat last group of shows on Metasploit,\none of the things I did was I\n\n368\n00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.780\nopened that Meterpeter on there and\nI dumped the LSA file, or\n\n369\n00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:21.090\nthe SAN file, LSA secrets from the local\nsystem and had the hashes in there.\n\n370\n00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:21.670\nWhat did I do?\n\n371\n00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:26.120\nI just went through and\nwent to a website and dumped the hash in.\n\n372\n00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:31.030\nAnd it said yeah I know what that is cuz\nsomeone had already popped that one in,\n\n373\n00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.380\nforced that one in and\ntold me immediately what it was.\n\n374\n00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.890\nSo there it is buried,\n\n375\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.990\nit's using something buried right\nin a piece of technology there.\n\n376\n00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:41.720\n>> Nice.\n\n377\n00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.210\nSo yeah we really do see\nencryption everywhere we look and\n\n378\n00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.840\nwe've gotta understand it so that we can\nimplement it correctly in out network,\n\n379\n00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.300\nbecause as you said earlier,\n\n380\n00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.350\npoorly implemented encryption really\ndoesn't do us all that much good.\n\n381\n00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.170\n>> It can be a detriment, it really can.\n\n382\n00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.000\n>> Gives you that false sense of security.\n\n383\n00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.700\n>> Yeah that would probably be number\none on the list is that you've got,\n\n384\n00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.800\nyou hear that magical word encryption,\nyou're like, oh well,\n\n385\n00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.300\nI can sleep well at night knowing\nthat my stuff's protected.\n\n386\n00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.550\nNot if it's implemented poorly.\n\n387\n00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:19.140\nThat's just gonna make you think that it's\nsafe, when someone else is kinda just\n\n388\n00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.780\nwringing their hands, going, yeah,\nI got one on the hook right now.\n\n389\n00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:29.070\nSo you can't take a chance with this type\nof stuff, so you really gotta know it.\n\n390\n00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.820\nI think I mentioned in one of\nour previous episodes on this,\n\n391\n00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.430\nI was talking about that guy I ran\ninto outside of the doctor's office.\n\n392\n00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.110\nState of the art, 56 bit encryption.\n\n393\n00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.025\nWhatever you say.\n\n394\n00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:45.000\n[LAUGH] He clearly didn't\nunderstand what he was doing.\n\n395\n00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.600\nLook like it in now,\nprobably most people that ran into them\n\n396\n00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.598\nthat are non-techers are gonna go,\noh that sounds important.\n\n397\n00:22:53.598 --> 00:22:55.844\n[LAUGH] I'm sure the doctor,\n\n398\n00:22:55.844 --> 00:22:59.970\nwhich is an old friend of mine, knew that\nthey would probably look at that and\n\n399\n00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.130\nsay oh, well cuz he knows how\nto work on eyeballs really well.\n\n400\n00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:07.000\nBut cryptography and\nIT stuff ain't his thing, so\n\n401\n00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.420\nhe really was like,\nthat sounds pretty impressive.\n\n402\n00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.530\nI come in and do this for\na living and no don't do that.\n\n403\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.790\nSo but he was a Marine so\nwhat do you expect?\n\n404\n00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:20.670\nNo I'm kidding.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n405\n00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:24.845\n>> Try to start a fight, look at.\n\n406\n00:23:24.845 --> 00:23:26.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hoorah.\n\n407\n00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.310\nI don't know who

on\ndifferent cryptographic solutions.\n\n411\n00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.490\nAnything else you want to toss in\nhere before we wrap this one up?\n\n412\n00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:41.490\nWhat I would throw into this\nis if you kind of need to\n\n413\n00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:47.070\ngo through the whole areas of setting\nup PKI which would be part of this,\n\n414\n00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:51.440\ndoing digital signatures,\ndoing SSL setting all those things up.\n\n415\n00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.010\nIf you really kind of wanna get\nto the nuts and bolts of it,\n\n416\n00:23:56.010 --> 00:24:00.320\nthat's been covered in the cryptography\ncourse Mike and I did.\n\n417\n00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.270\nIt's been covered and\n\n418\n00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:06.480\nit's in some of the Microsoft\ncourses have those topics built in.\n\n419\n00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.960\nSo it's already been well\ncovered in those ones.\n\n420\n00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:14.018\nWhat we're trying to get here is away from\nkind of the mechanics on cryptography and\n\n421\n00:24:14.018 --> 00:24:16.270\njust kind of, just to open your eyes and\n\n422\n00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.770\nlet you know that this is a big design\nconsideration and something that you\n\n423\n00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.390\nneed to be thinking about when you're\nputting your solution together.\n\n424\n00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.800\nIf you need to figure out the mechanics\nof how it works, well then\n\n425\n00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.550\nthere's resources available for that,\nthat we've already gone down that road.\n\n426\n00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.420\nThey don't expect with,\nwhen you're at a CASP level,\n\n427\n00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:42.660\nthey're not expecting it\nto be

00:00:14.180\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.440\nAnd with me today is none\nother than Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.580\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.130\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing today?\n\n7\n00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.390\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.320\nWe're continuing on with our Comptia\nadvanced security practitioner\n\n9\n00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.130\nepisodes and in this episode we're gonna\nbe looking at cryptographic attacks.\n\n10\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.175\nDifferent ways that, you know we've\ntalked about cryptography and\n\n11\n00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:36.170\nwhere we use it and how it's implemented\nin a network to keep our resources secure.\n\n12\n00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.600\nNow we're gonna take a look at some\nof the ways that people try to attack\n\n13\n00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.900\nthose implementations because knowing\nis half the battle right, Sean?\n\n14\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.620\nI mean if we have an idea of what they're\ndoing we can maybe be better protected or\n\n15\n00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.780\nat least detect it.\n\n16\n00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.054\n>> When you say knowing is half\nthe battle, I think of GI Joe.\n\n17\n00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:52.440\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] Now I know.\n\n18\n00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.260\n>> [LAUGH] I still don't know what\nthe other half of the battle is, though.\n\n19\n00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.270\nThey've never explained that to me once.\n\n20\n00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.680\nI got half of it down pat,\nI don't know where the rest of it goes.\n\n21\n00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.570\nBut anyways, so what are these guys doing?\n\n22\n00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.300\nWhat are the people out there trying\nto do when they try to break our\n\n23\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.070\ncryptographic solutions?\n\n24\n00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.740\n>> Yeah, this is the thing is that,\ncryptography,\n\n25\n00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.280\nit's by no means a perfect solution.\n\n26\n00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.430\nThey do make that claim in one case,\n\n27\n00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.320\nwith something that we didn't talk about,\ncuz it's just really not part of this.\n\n28\n00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.401\nBut when we talked about\nthe one-time pads,\n\n29\n00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:29.800\none-time pads if used as specified,\nare considered to be unbreakable.\n\n30\n00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.740\nBut those ones aside, those ones\nare just logistically very tough to do\n\n31\n00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.700\nover a long period of time continuously.\n\n32\n00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.010\nSo if we're looking at just\nwhat we talked about so\n\n33\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.050\nfar, all those things\nare considered to be breakable,\n\n34\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.710\nit's just a question of which\ntechnique are you gonna employ and\n\n35\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.020\nwhat flaws does the system have that\nare gonna allow you to break it.\n\n36\n00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.920\nSo this is where you get knowledge of some\nof the different attacks you can use.\n\n37\n00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.610\nAnd so you can kind of use that\nto kind of put in the pot,\n\n38\n00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.040\nstir around with everything else,\nand see what strengths and\n\n39\n00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.510\nwhat technology you have to\nuse to make things better.\n\n40\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.230\nSo, but just remember that point, starting\noff, is that except for that one case,\n\n41\n00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.970\ncryptography is not a perfect,\nairtight solution.\n\n42\n00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.580\nThere are ways you can you can get\ninto it, it's just a question of time.\n\n43\n00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.965\nIt's not a question of if,\nit's a question of when.\n\n44\n00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:31.270\n>> Mm-hm, and hopefully it is\nmore time than the bad guys have.\n\n45\n00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.094\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's really a big part of it,\n\n46\n00:02:33.094 --> 00:02:35.767\ntoo, is that, yeah,\nyou could always break encryption,\n\n47\n00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:38.180\nit's just a question of\nwhen you're gonna break it.\n\n48\n00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.145\nAnd if you know you're gonna break it,\nokay, that's one thing, but\n\n49\n00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:49.206\nif that's gonna be broken 50 years from\nnow, if that was vital information today,\n\n50\n00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:53.740\nit's probably not vital\ninformation 50 years from now.\n\n51\n00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.190\nSo, we don't necessarily care about.\n\n52\n00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.480\nBut it's been technologies like a better\ncomputing power, better techniques,\n\n53\n00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.510\nyou know and all that jazz that has\nactually help speed up the process.\n\n54\n00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.210\nSo that's why algorithms have had\nto get stronger and stronger and\n\n55\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.520\nstronger because we have\nthat boost of power and\n\n56\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.190\nother things behind it to speed up\nthe cracking and breaking process.\n\n57\n00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.460\n>> So, would it be fair to say that we\nhave to understand that there is no\n\n58\n00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.200\nbulletproof 100% safe solution?\n\n59\n00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.320\nBut, what we try to do then\nis look at our information,\n\n60\n00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.760\nlook at the what the resource we're trying\nto protect and try to find a solution that\n\n61\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.190\nwill protect it through\nthe lifetime of that information or\n\n62\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.120\nthat resources, and\nreally that's what we're trying to do.\n\n63\n00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.340\n>> Yeah, that's really it.\n\n64\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.980\nWhen you start configuring\nsystems you'll see that they\n\n65\n00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.410\ngive you a wide range of choices of key\nlengths and stuff like that you can use.\n\n66\n00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.894\nBut, when you get down to it,\nyou might look at the specification or\n\n67\n00:03:51.894 --> 00:03:56.200\nsomething like that and it says you can't\nuse anything less than this bit length.\n\n68\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.877\nAnd the reason why they're saying that is\nbecause they need that level of strength\n\n69\n00:04:00.877 --> 00:04:05.486\nto ensure that it's not something to be\nbroken easily, using technologies that\n\n70\n00:04:05.486 --> 00:04:09.481\nare anticipated to be in use now as\nwell as several years down the line,\n\n71\n00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:14.450\nbecause they don't want to compromise\ncertain pieces of information.\n\n72\n00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.138\nAnd so you've got to figure out where\nyou're gonna be on that spectrum.\n\n73\n00:04:18.138 --> 00:04:20.400\nAnd now, it would sound like well,\n\n74\n00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.980\none of the things we've talked about that\nmakes cryptography stronger is having\n\n75\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.780\na large number of keys and longer keys and\nthe complexity of the key.\n\n76\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.750\nWell, it sounds like if you just go\nto just the one saying that you have\n\n77\n00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.470\na longer key,\nit's just a better way to go.\n\n78\n00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.110\nWell, if you just wanna talk\nabout it in those terms and\n\n79\n00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.869\njust talk about a longer key,\nhey, a longer key is better.\n\n80\n00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.700\nWe could argue that we're not, but\n\n81\n00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.541\nwe could argue that that's a better idea,\nthat's a good idea or not.\n\n82\n00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:57.902\nHowever, as a key gets longer and longer,\nif you factor in computing power,\n\n83\n00:04:57.902 --> 00:05:04.260\nnow your processing time takes a big\nhit and starts going downhill.\n\n84\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.480\nSo it might sound better,\nhey, if 128 is good and\n\n85\n00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.570\n256 is better then I'm gonna ratchet\nthis all the way up to like 2048 or\n\n86\n00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.058\n4096 and just you know paddle\nthat boat out as far as it goes.\n\n87\n00:05:15.058 --> 00:05:17.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not a good idea because you will\n\n88\n00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.610\nsuffer a performance hit for it.\n\n89\n00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.700\nAnd it may not look like much just on\na one time basis, but on a system,\n\n90\n00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.040\nlike a PKI system that's using that,\nyou're gonna notice, and\n\n91\n00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.360\nso it's about trade offs there too.\n\n92\n00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.350\nSo you can't go all the way toward\nthe extreme, but you don't want to go all\n\n93\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.040\nthe way out to the other end to get hey,\nmake it as fast as possible.\n\n94\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.700\nYeah, it makes the system work really fast\nbut you also break it really fast too.\n\n95\n00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.490\nSo you've got to find those trade offs.\n\n96\n00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.920\nThat's why it's very important for\n\n97\n00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.340\nyou to kind of understand when you go\nthrough these legal regulations and\n\n98\n00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.990\nstuff like that, what they're getting at\nby saying these different key lengths\n\n99\n00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.210\nbecause those are things that ward off\nattacks and make the system stronger.\n\n100\n00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.480\nDoesn't stop the attack but\nit does slow it down and\n\n101\n00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.800\npotentially makes the person go for\ngreener pastures.\n\n102\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.010\nThey may not just have the time,\nthey may look for\n\n103\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.260\nanother way to violate that system or\ncompromise it somehow.\n\n104\n00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.350\nYou really gotta think about that.\n\n105\n00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.981\n>> I remember an example way back when\nWEP had been out for a little while\n\n106\n00:06:17.981 --> 00:06:22.460\non those little home routers they\ngave you a choice of key lengths and\n\n107\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.120\nyou could bump it up a little bit\nto make it a little more secure but\n\n108\n00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.370\nI remember my WiFi\nperformance took a huge hit.\n\n109\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.286\nBecause back in that time, those\nprocessors that we had or those network\n\n110\n00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:38.035\nadapters, that extra key length yeah, made\nthe traffic more difficult to get into, so\n\n111\n00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:40.686\nit was more secure, but\nthe performance there.\n\n112\n00:06:40.686 --> 00:06:42.930\nAnd you know, I looked at my,\nit was a home network,\n\n113\n00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.390\nit didn't have a lot of\nsensitive information on there.\n\n114\n00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.860\nSo I wanted the performance more than\nI needed that extra layer of security.\n\n115\n00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.710\nSame kind of thing we're looking\nat in our corporate environment.\n\n116\n00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.410\nWe don't want to just jump\nup to that 4096 key length.\n\n117\n00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.630\nIt is more secure than 2048, but\nif it's going to hurt our performance,\n\n118\n00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.910\nwe've got to find that balance in there.\n\n119\n00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.580\nYes, we want good security but at the same\ntime, I've got to make sure my systems\n\n120\n00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.860\nare usable, that people can do\ntheir job and things like that.\n\n121\n00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.960\nSo sometimes it's a trade-off there.\n\n122\n00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.070\n>> Yeah it is definitely.\n\n123\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.120\nEverything is about trade-offs and\nthis is no exception.\n\n124\n00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:23.410\nYou know every system does have a flaw or\ndoes have things that you need to take\n\n125\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.830\ninto account, whether it's an actual flaw,\nor it's just someone configuring it wrong,\n\n126\n00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.310\nor misapplying it,\nwhich happens far too often.\n\n127\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.455\nThose things,\nif you look at them the right way,\n\n128\n00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:40.521\ncan very easily attract the right\nattention or wrong attention, depending on\n\n129\n00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:45.688\nwhere you're coming in on the equation,\nand can make it vulnerable to attack.\n\n130\n00:07:45.688 --> 00:07:49.032\nAnd so, that's what we really\ngotta take into account.\n\n131\n00:07:49.032 --> 00:07:52.322\nAnd it can be things like configuration,\n\n132\n00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:58.436\nit can be the way the algorithm was\ncreated, it could be other things as well.\n\n133\n00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:01.497\nSo when we talk about these attacks,\n\n134\n00:08:01.497 --> 00:08:05.860\nthink about what type of\nthings make that possible.\n\n135\n00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.680\nIs it a flaw in the actual system?\n\n136\n00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.470\nOr is it a flaw in\nthe way it was designed?\n\n137\n00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.610\nOr a flaw [LAUGH] in\nthe way it was being used?\n\n138\n00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.390\nYou can see all those\nthings come into account.\n\n139\n00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.760\nSo, don't ever forget that.\n\n140\n00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.410\nYou look at something like,\nwhen we did the cryptography course,\n\n141\n00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.920\nright near the end of it,\nwe did quantum cryptography.\n\n142\n00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.360\nAnd the claim is that quantum cryptography\nis as close to perfect as you can get\n\n143\n00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.170\nbecause the keys aren't flying\nthrough the air, so to speak.\n\n144\n00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:39.900\nThe data's getting encrypted and\nthen the keys are being exchanged.\n\n145\n00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.348\nWell, the reality is that it's just\nthe key of the algorithm sucks,\n\n146\n00:08:43.348 --> 00:08:45.142\ndon't care what key you got for it.\n\n147\n00:08:45.142 --> 00:08:49.262\n>> And given enough time, the bad guys\nwill figure out a way to get around that.\n\n148\n00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:52.210\nBut hopefully by then,\nwe got something even better.\n\n149\n00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.616\nDouble quantum cryptography!\n\n150\n00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:54.314\nI don't know.\n\n151\n00:08:54.314 --> 00:08:57.570\n>> [LAUGH] Little square logo.\n\n152\n00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.990\n>> So, let's talk about some of\nthe different types of attacks\n\n153\n00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.910\nthat we have to deal with like, I know you\nhad mentioned one, frequency analysis.\n\n154\n00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.190\nWhat we were talking about there.\n\n155\n00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.860\n>> That's one of the earlier types of\nattacks, it's been around for awhile.\n\n156\n00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.800\nIt's been applied in different ways, but\n\n157\n00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:21.840\nwhat it relies upon is a number\nof things present in the system,\n\n158\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.010\nand one of the main things is,\nif it can see patterns or\n\n159\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:33.090\nany sort of thing it can ascertain that\nthere's some rhyme or reason to it.\n\n160\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.715\nOne of the terms we used in\nthis first section was entropy,\n\n161\n00:09:36.715 --> 00:09:41.250\nis you wanna have as much entropy as\nyou can reasonably get in there to make\n\n162\n00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.770\nit appear to be random\nas much as possible.\n\n163\n00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:49.770\nEven though, if we look at an encrypted\nblob of data, we know that there is\n\n164\n00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:55.280\nsome formula or algorithm that\nwas used to get it that way,\n\n165\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.830\nwe don't want that to be something\nthat can be easily discernible.\n\n166\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:02.300\nSo, we try to mix as much\nentropy as we can in.\n\n167\n00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.760\nIf that's not done correctly and\nsomeone misconfigures it, or\n\n168\n00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.040\nthere is just a flaw in the algorithm,\nyou can start to detect patterns in that,\n\n169\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.370\nand once you can start detecting patterns,\n\n170\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:20.120\nthat starts getting down the road\ntowards it's easier to break.\n\n171\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.270\nNow, we are not saying it is absolutely\nbreakable, I'm just saying it becomes much\n\n172\n00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.580\neasier to break at that point\nbecause now you've got a pattern,\n\n173\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.160\nyou know if stuff's fed through it,\ncertain patterns emerge.\n\n174\n00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.170\nAnd so, you try to avoid that.\n\n175\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:39.150\nAnd we have examples of this\nhappening throughout all of history.\n\n176\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:45.000\nOne of the ones that we've seen in the\n20th century, the famous one was Enigma.\n\n177\n00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.640\nEnigma did have some stuff.\n\n178\n00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.509\nIf you really do your research on it,\nyou'll see that it did lend itself\n\n179\n00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:55.244\nto frequency analysis under\ncertain conditions, and\n\n180\n00:10:55.244 --> 00:10:59.729\nonce that was determined,\nit made it [SOUND] really easy to break.\n\n181\n00:10:59.729 --> 00:11:02.370\nRelatively speaking, of course,\nreally easy to break.\n\n182\n00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.042\nAnother form of it would be,\n\n183\n00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:12.367\nthe one that I quoted in the cryptography\ncourse was hieroglyphics.\n\n184\n00:11:12.367 --> 00:11:16.931\nHieroglyphics, while it's not really\nmeant to conceal information,\n\n185\n00:11:16.931 --> 00:11:22.017\nit does very well illustrate how frequency\nanalyses work because when they dug up\n\n186\n00:11:22.017 --> 00:11:27.024\nthe Rosetta Stone, and did their review\non it, they had three languages on it,\n\n187\n00:11:27.024 --> 00:11:31.180\ntwo they knew, one they didn't,\nwhich was the hieroglyphics.\n\n188\n00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.140\nAnd so the two they knew, they were\nable to read both of them and say hey,\n\n189\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.791\nthis was the same message, so\n\n190\n00:11:36.791 --> 00:11:41.304\nit makes sense that this third chunk of\nwriting up here would be the same message.\n\n191\n00:11:41.304 --> 00:11:44.665\nSo, they looked for a pattern in\nthe first two that matched up and\n\n192\n00:11:44.665 --> 00:11:48.149\nthen they matched up to something there,\nand said, okay, well,\n\n193\n00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:51.100\nthe patterns appear in the same density,\nmore or less.\n\n194\n00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.900\nWell, that tells us that those characters,\nor inscriptions,\n\n195\n00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:01.060\nprobably represent the same concepts and\nideas that we had in the other languages.\n\n196\n00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.570\nSo, that would be an application\nof a kind of frequency analysis.\n\n197\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.470\nSo you try to avoid it as much\nas possible in the the system.\n\n198\n00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:16.130\nEvery language is prone to some sort of\nfrequency analysis or patterns in it.\n\n199\n00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.320\nEnglish language definitely has it.\n\n200\n00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.570\nWhen I was talking about doing the Caesar\ncipher in one of our earlier episodes\n\n201\n00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:29.917\nin this, I pointed out that when you just\ndid that simple freeze step key shift,\n\n202\n00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:33.975\nyou could see that there were\nOs repeating when we shifted it,\n\n203\n00:12:35.135 --> 00:12:40.215\nand I said that we know that since\neverything here uses the same key shift\n\n204\n00:12:40.215 --> 00:12:43.635\nall the way down,\nno matter where we see the letter O,\n\n205\n00:12:43.635 --> 00:12:46.845\nit's going to represent the exact\nsame letter in plain text.\n\n206\n00:12:46.845 --> 00:12:51.810\nAnd so, just seeing a bunch of Os spread\nout through a bunch of writing, we could\n\n207\n00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.150\nwork with that because we do know certain\ncharacters tend to appear in certain\n\n208\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:13:01.650\npercentages for every hundred characters,\nbut once you start seeing things,\n\n209\n00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:07.150\nwhat helps you out there, rather,\nis when you start seeing Os doubled up.\n\n210\n00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:12.120\nBecause there's not a ton of cases in the\nEnglish language where you have a letter\n\n211\n00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.590\nthat doubles up like that.\n\n212\n00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.640\nYou can think of them,\nyou can probably count them on two hands,\n\n213\n00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.580\nthe characters that double up like that,\nand by doing that,\n\n214\n00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.610\nyou can actually start\nto work on breaking it.\n\n215\n00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:30.310\nAnd see, if I shift it a certain way\nto make those letters translate to\n\n216\n00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.170\nsomething else, if I use the same\nthing on the other stuff,\n\n217\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:38.270\ndo I start getting a message or\nsomething that's recognizable?\n\n218\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.960\nSo, frequency analysis can be\npretty powerful stuff, and\n\n219\n00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.630\nwith the case of the Caesar cipher, to\nshow you one of the ways they thwarted it.\n\n220\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.710\nThe Caesar cipher worked very well for\n\n221\n00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:54.470\nits time, but once it was learned how that\nworked, they had to kind of up there game.\n\n222\n00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.009\nThat's where the Vigenère cipher came in.\n\n223\n00:13:56.009 --> 00:13:58.461\nIt was a multiple alphabet model, so\n\n224\n00:13:58.461 --> 00:14:02.662\nthey had multiple substitution\nalphabets based on a keyword.\n\n225\n00:14:02.662 --> 00:14:06.122\nNow, they've bumped it up and\nmade it so it's not as easy.\n\n226\n00:14:06.122 --> 00:14:11.094\nThose patterns don't appear because\nO in one point will not mean\n\n227\n00:14:11.094 --> 00:14:15.530\nthe same as another O in another\npart of that cipher text.\n\n228\n00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:21.320\nSo, that's the way they addressed\nit through the actual system,\n\n229\n00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.430\nbut then just another way to\nshow how implementation can make\n\n230\n00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:31.850\nthings happen is frequency analysis, if\nyou go and refer to things like Enigma or\n\n231\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:36.770\neven one-time pads, in fact, let's just\ntake one-time pads to make it simple.\n\n232\n00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:41.140\nOne time pads, you're supposed to have\na plain text message and a key, and\n\n233\n00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.870\nthat's generated once, and\nused once, and then discarded.\n\n234\n00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:49.420\nIn theory, if you keep it that way, and\nuse it once and discard it, and you use\n\n235\n00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.470\na different key for a new set of plain\ntext, you shouldn't have any problems.\n\n236\n00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.270\nBy the time someone\ndetermines what the key is,\n\n237\n00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.180\nit's been taken out of circulation.\n\n238\n00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.150\nNever to be seen again.\n\n239\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.570\nPotentially, never to be seen again.\n\n240\n00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.900\nThe thing is is that the one\ntime pads what they suffer from\n\n241\n00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:11.660\nis not the system itself,\nit's the human beings using it because\n\n242\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:16.860\nI don't want to write down a bunch of keys\nthat are going to be used to decode this.\n\n243\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.550\nWhat am I going to do?\n\n244\n00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.330\nI'm just going to reuse the same one,\nno one's going to know.\n\n245\n00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:24.621\nYeah, someone is going to know because\neven if you have different plain text and\n\n246\n00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:28.016\nyou encode that with the same\nkey to get different ciphertext,\n\n247\n00:15:28.016 --> 00:15:32.269\nyou can lay those over the top of one\nanother and start seeing patterns emerge.\n\n248\n00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:35.659\nAnd so,\nthat's again a frequency analysis thing.\n\n249\n00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:39.224\nSo, it's amazing when you look at it.\n\n250\n00:15:39.224 --> 00:15:44.600\nYou may not see those patterns initially,\nbut they are there in every language.\n\n251\n00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.160\nI'm just using English cuz\n[LAUGH] that's what I know.\n\n252\n00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.418\nBut any language you use is gonna\nhave that exact same issue.\n\n253\n00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:55.229\n>> Frequency analysis then is really\njust taking that encrypted data, and\n\n254\n00:15:55.229 --> 00:15:59.288\nlooking for patterns in that, and trying\nto figure out how it was encrypted or\n\n255\n00:15:59.288 --> 00:16:01.544\nwhat method was used to encrypt that data.\n\n256\n00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:02.527\n>> Exactly.\n\n257\n00:16:02.527 --> 00:16:04.990\nIf you can see that pattern,\nYou've got something to work with.\n\n258\n00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.538\n>> Nice.\n\n259\n00:16:05.538 --> 00:16:07.527\nAll right,\nthen another one you got on our list is,\n\n260\n00:16:07.527 --> 00:16:10.907\nI know we've mentioned it a couple times,\nbrute force, throwing everything at it and\n\n261\n00:16:10.907 --> 00:16:12.640\nseeing what sticks I\nthink was your phrase.\n\n262\n00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.170\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n263\n00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.640\nthat's the way I look at it.\n\n264\n00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.620\nIt's like, hey let's just run\nsome stuff up the flagpole and\n\n265\n00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.440\nsee what waves, you know.\n\n266\n00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.000\nThat's the type of deal is that you're\nthrowing everything you have at it to see\n\n267\n00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.740\nif something matches,\nand brute force actually\n\n268\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.550\nhas a distinction of being the only thing\nthat actually works 100% of the time.\n\n269\n00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.326\nAnd that sounds like, oh well good,\nthe heck with the rest of that,\n\n270\n00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:35.512\nI'm just going to use that.\n\n271\n00:16:35.512 --> 00:16:37.198\n>> If you got 10,000 years, yeah.\n\n272\n00:16:37.198 --> 00:16:39.150\n[LAUGH]\n>> Depends how much time you have.\n\n273\n00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:43.300\nYou know, but somebody, if you use brute\nforce against some algorithms that are out\n\n274\n00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.590\nthere in use today.\n\n275\n00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:50.930\nBy the time you did an exhaustive search\nof the whole keyspace, you wouldn't be\n\n276\n00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.105\nable to read the results because the sun\nwould have burnt out and you'd be dead.\n\n277\n00:16:54.105 --> 00:16:59.065\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it wouldn't matter, [LAUGH] so yeah.\n\n278\n00:16:59.065 --> 00:17:03.945\nIt would be a meaningless exercise but\nsome of these other ones, if you look at\n\n279\n00:17:03.945 --> 00:17:10.875\nsomething like DAZ with the 56 bit key,\nthat is a much smaller key space.\n\n280\n00:17:10.875 --> 00:17:17.050\nSeveral orders of magnitude smaller\nthan something that's 128 or 256.\n\n281\n00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.590\nSo you can search that a lot quicker.\n\n282\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:22.770\nSo as you get a shorter key,\nyou can, less bits on the key,\n\n283\n00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.870\nyou can see it's easier and\neasier to search.\n\n284\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:28.600\nI mean if you look at just\nthe Caesar cipher and\n\n285\n00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.640\nuse the English language,\n>> Only 26 possible keys, or 25 really.\n\n286\n00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.390\n>> Yeah,\nyou don't have that many to search.\n\n287\n00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.510\nYou can do that, you know, over lunch,\nso, and the more computing power\n\n288\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:45.320\nyou throw behind these things, longer\nkeys, it's gonna start scaling that down.\n\n289\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.080\nAnd that's one of the reasons\nwhy every few years you'll see\n\n290\n00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.000\nthe standardized key lengths they use,\nthey bump them up a bit.\n\n291\n00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.730\nAt one point, 56-bit was considered to be\nhey, great, you know let's go with that.\n\n292\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.355\nIt's not considered good anymore.\n\n293\n00:17:59.355 --> 00:18:02.860\n64-bit was considered to be\ndecent at some point, and\n\n294\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.875\nit's not considered to be\nreally wise to use that.\n\n295\n00:18:05.875 --> 00:18:09.460\n128-bit, there's been claims even five,\nsix,\n\n296\n00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.860\nseven years ago that said,\nthey're impossible to break.\n\n297\n00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.150\nOkay, that's at that time.\n\n298\n00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.130\nSo when you read those things,\nand they say they're impossible,\n\n299\n00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.908\nthat means by today's standards,\nthat's impossible.\n\n300\n00:18:23.908 --> 00:18:27.950\nWhen computing power kicks up\nagain several orders of magnitude,\n\n301\n00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.330\nthose things are gonna become\nmuch easier to break so\n\n302\n00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.510\nthey're gonna have to paddle it out\na bit more and go for a longer key.\n\n303\n00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:35.990\nSo that's the way those work, but\n\n304\n00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:40.960\nbrute force will always work,\nand we've seen examples of it.\n\n305\n00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.560\nOne of the examples goes\nback to that authentication\n\n306\n00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.422\nissue that we were looking\nat when we did display,\n\n307\n00:18:49.422 --> 00:18:53.760\nwe put in some hash and\ndumped it into that crack station dot net.\n\n308\n00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.254\nWe just dumped it into a field and\ntold it to crack it,\n\n309\n00:18:58.254 --> 00:19:02.710\nand it popped up, you know,\nthe text that matched that hash.\n\n310\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.028\nWell, it did that because it can detect.\n\n311\n00:19:05.028 --> 00:19:08.710\nAnd there's ways of looking at a hash and\ntell what type\n\n312\n00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:13.200\nof algorithm was used to do that and\nthen you can just go through and\n\n313\n00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.370\nsee what was already brute\nforced hashed to the system.\n\n314\n00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.960\nAnd just look it up through it\nlike you would in database but\n\n315\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.420\nto see what created that hash and\nyou're done.\n\n316\n00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.790\nSomeone brute forced,\nbuilt all the stuff into a database and\n\n317\n00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:29.756\nhave it online someplace.\n\n318\n00:19:29.756 --> 00:19:33.670\nSo it's definitely done.\n\n319\n00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.990\n>> And then I know you talked about known\nplain text, another issue that we have to\n\n320\n00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:41.850\ndeal with, another type of attack\nagainst our crypto systems.\n\n321\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:46.610\nThere is all different\nforms of these attacks.\n\n322\n00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.783\nThere's known plain text,\nknown cipher texts, chosen plain text,\n\n323\n00:19:49.783 --> 00:19:51.200\nchosen cipher texts.\n\n324\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.230\nThere is a whole family of those things.\n\n325\n00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.120\nThings like known plaintext\nmeans that you've got something.\n\n326\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.290\nYou know what the actual\nlanguage of it is.\n\n327\n00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:02.322\nOr the original message was written in,\nand so\n\n328\n00:20:02.322 --> 00:20:05.070\nyou can use that to make assumptions.\n\n329\n00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.100\nYou know,\nif I give you a piece of ciphertext and\n\n330\n00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:13.040\nyou know that the underlying language was\nEnglish, now you can start saying, okay,\n\n331\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.180\nI can discard, you know, Chinese and\nJapanese and Spanish and\n\n332\n00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.290\nall the other languages because\nthose are a different rule set.\n\n333\n00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.590\nFor those languages.\n\n334\n00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:26.170\nThe English language has its own rule\nset if we want to put it in those terms.\n\n335\n00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:33.120\nSo we can not the patterns of\nthe English language have already been\n\n336\n00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.139\nflushed out and written down and are used\nin the computing and technology world.\n\n337\n00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:39.920\nSomeone's built that into a system.\n\n338\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.760\nOnce we know it's English, well we\ncan go forward with that looking for\n\n339\n00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.270\nfrequency analysis, brute forcing it and\n\n340\n00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:51.035\ndoing little things to see what\nthe original message was as well as.\n\n341\n00:20:51.035 --> 00:20:53.815\nAs figuring out perhaps\nhow the algorithm works.\n\n342\n00:20:53.815 --> 00:20:59.105\nIf you just have something that will\nspit out in the back end you can figure\n\n343\n00:20:59.105 --> 00:21:02.945\nout how reversing that stuff, you can\nstart getting an idea with enough messages\n\n344\n00:21:02.945 --> 00:21:06.105\nin hand,\nyou can figure out how that system works.\n\n345\n00:21:06.105 --> 00:21:10.115\nAnd we have examples of that, you know,\nI keep using Enigma as an example.\n\n346\n00:21:10.115 --> 00:21:13.940\nThat's one of the things that helped\nit out is that they had messages and\n\n347\n00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:18.410\nthey knew the messages were in German,\nthat wasn't a weird stretch there.\n\n348\n00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.810\nSo they went through and said okay, well\nthis is in German and what was the thing\n\n349\n00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:27.600\nthat was actually the eureka moment, or\none of the eureka moments of it was.\n\n350\n00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.600\nThey knew those messages during the war\nended with the term Heil Hitler.\n\n351\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.600\nAnd so they knew that was in there,\nso they knew it was German and\n\n352\n00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.810\nthey knew there was something\nspecific underneath there.\n\n353\n00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.480\nAnd that helped them push\ntowards actually breaking that\n\n354\n00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.190\nmuch quicker because they can eliminate\na lot of possibilities at that point.\n\n355\n00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:48.780\nSo it's a fascinating study in that.\n\n356\n00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.060\nIn fact, I would recommend anybody\nwho hasn't seen that movie.\n\n357\n00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.490\nIt was the Imitation Game I think is it.\n\n358\n00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.630\nYeah, you really wanna check it out.\n\n359\n00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.300\nIt's been fictionalized\na bit about Turing but\n\n360\n00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.860\nI think they took a little\nbit of liberties with it.\n\n361\n00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.800\nBut they do put enough of\nthe actual science and\n\n362\n00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.960\nstudy into it that gives\nyou that insight to it,\n\n363\n00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.530\nso if you don't wanna get down to the\nbrass tacks and everything it is there.\n\n364\n00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:13.650\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n365\n00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:17.085\nSo a lot of different ways\nthey can really hammer on or\n\n366\n00:22:17.085 --> 00:22:19.175\ntry to break our cryptographic solutions.\n\n367\n00:22:19.175 --> 00:22:22.215\nAny other types of attacks\nyou wanna talk about?\n\n368\n00:22:22.215 --> 00:22:25.885\n>> Yeah there's ones that could\nget much more crude than that and\n\n369\n00:22:25.885 --> 00:22:26.955\nthey're not as elegant.\n\n370\n00:22:26.955 --> 00:22:29.405\nThey have ones like a brute\n\n371\n00:22:29.405 --> 00:22:33.975\nforce is considered to be one of the more\ninelegant ones cause there's no real\n\n372\n00:22:33.975 --> 00:22:38.320\nscience to that you just keep pounding\non it until something happens.\n\n373\n00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.490\nBut there's other ones even\nless elegant than that.\n\n374\n00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.150\nThey actually, funny enough,\n\n375\n00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:48.310\nthey even have one called the rubber hose\nattack which is someone's got the key,\n\n376\n00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.290\nyou just tie them to your chair and\nbeat them up until they give you the key.\n\n377\n00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.723\nOkay, so, I don't know.\n\n378\n00:22:53.723 --> 00:22:55.843\n>> [LAUGH] That's all under\nsocial engineering there?\n\n379\n00:22:55.843 --> 00:22:56.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n380\n00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.330\nthat's more of a social engineering thing.\n\n381\n00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:02.950\nYou know and then there's a even\nsomething that just does, you know,\n\n382\n00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.590\ndoes actually merit\nsome attention here is,\n\n383\n00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:10.080\nis when we talked about algorithms\nearly on in the series.\n\n384\n00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.220\nOne of the things that wasn't talk\nabout is when algorithms are designed,\n\n385\n00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.790\nthere is something that,\nwe talked about in other areas.\n\n386\n00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.940\nBut it's something called\nKirkoff's principle,\n\n387\n00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.155\nwe talk about it in\nthe cryptography course.\n\n388\n00:23:22.155 --> 00:23:27.180\nKirkoffs's principle for those that\nhaven't seen that, when a algorithm is put\n\n389\n00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:32.240\nout and designed, the principle\n\n390\n00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.650\nsays that you can put the algorithm out\nthere but you don't put the key out there.\n\n391\n00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:39.590\nAnd so\nthey're saying that the security and\n\n392\n00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:43.760\nstrength of the system relies\non the secrecy of the key.\n\n393\n00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.240\nNot the algorithm itself.\n\n394\n00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.841\nYou can look at that all day and\nscrutinize it and see all the particulars\n\n395\n00:23:49.841 --> 00:23:54.901\nand how that works, but that's only gonna\ntell you how the algorithm works and\n\n396\n00:23:54.901 --> 00:23:58.749\nit's gonna tell you how many\npossible keys can go in there.\n\n397\n00:23:58.749 --> 00:24:04.275\nYou still have to do an exhaustive key\nsearch and so that's gonna get messy.\n\n398\n00:24:04.275 --> 00:24:09.360\nSo, Kerckhoffs's principle,\none of the things behind this is, not only\n\n399\n00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:14.970\nshould the strength of the system rely on\nthe secrecy of the key not the algorithm.\n\n400\n00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.810\nBut it also has the added benefit,\nif you follow Kerckhoffs's principle, and\n\n401\n00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:24.370\nit's just that, it's a principal,\nit's not a law of the land or anything.\n\n402\n00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.170\nIt's something that you can put\nthe algorithm out there and\n\n403\n00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.550\nother academics and\nothers can study it and\n\n404\n00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.530\nfind, scrutinize it, pound on it,\nand potentially find flaws.\n\n405\n00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.854\nAnd it gives it time to adjust and\n\n406\n00:24:37.854 --> 00:24:42.599\nbe tweaked before it's used in\nany sort of mass implementation.\n\n407\n00:24:42.599 --> 00:24:46.537\nAnd interestingly enough,\nover the years, just following,\n\n408\n00:24:46.537 --> 00:24:51.369\neven though Kerckhoffs's principle may\nnot have been named specifically in\n\n409\n00:24:51.369 --> 00:24:56.126\nevery one of those cases, it has shown\nthat even the best cryptographers out\n\n410\n00:24:56.126 --> 00:24:57.784\nthere can make mistakes.\n\n411\n00:24:57.784 --> 00:25:03.717\nYou know that saying goes,\nnobody's perfect.\n\n412\n00:25:03.717 --> 00:25:08.415\nIt kind of applies here,\nbecause you have guys like Ron Rivest,\n\n413\n00:25:08.415 --> 00:25:10.767\none of the founders of RSA.\n\n414\n00:25:10.767 --> 00:25:12.957\nThe RC series of cyphers?\n\n415\n00:25:12.957 --> 00:25:13.697\nThat's his baby.\n\n416\n00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.474\nThere, you may wonder why,\nyou hear about RC four, five and six, and\n\n417\n00:25:17.474 --> 00:25:18.590\nwhere did the other ones go?\n\n418\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.022\nThe other ones are the cutting room floor,\nthat's where they are.\n\n419\n00:25:22.022 --> 00:25:22.534\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n420\n00:25:22.534 --> 00:25:24.994\n>> Because they were put out there and\n\n421\n00:25:24.994 --> 00:25:29.406\nthey found flaws in them and\ntherefore they were\n\n422\n00:25:29.406 --> 00:25:33.560\nnot used.\nProfessor Rivest actually tried\n\n423\n00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:38.270\nto tweak them, do stuff to them and\nrealized it was just not worth it.\n\n424\n00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.200\nIt was better to just dump that.\n\n425\n00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.380\nAfter those flaws were found and\n\n426\n00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:47.430\nto start from scratch on\nsomething on a new version of it.\n\n427\n00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:51.720\nSo that you can actually judge as\nan example of how Kerckhoffs's principle\n\n428\n00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.340\nalso helps give other people\na chance to look at that,\n\n429\n00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:00.030\nscrutinize it potentially, give you\ntheir input on how to make that better.\n\n430\n00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:04.010\nAnd it's more eyeballs on it,\nsomething like this.\n\n431\n00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:07.840\nYou can be the best at what you do,\nthe more eyeballs you get on it,\n\n432\n00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.660\nsomeone's gonna find something that\ncould either be done better, or\n\n433\n00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.930\nmight be a potential area of concern.\n\n434\n00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:18.450\nI think with, what is it, RC2,\nwhen it was done, someone found what they\n\n435\n00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:22.620\ncall a side-channel attack where you can\nmanipulate the bits going into the system.\n\n436\n00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.230\nAnd if you did it just the right way it\nwould puke out a bunch of stuff telling\n\n437\n00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.680\nyou exactly what keys were being used.\n\n438\n00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:34.030\nAnd it wasn't somebody that was a PhD,\nI mean Robert Rivest is a PhD.\n\n439\n00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:40.175\nHe's up there and MIT, you know, I believe\nis even still teaching there today.\n\n440\n00:26:40.175 --> 00:26:45.375\nBut you have somebody that i\nthink was an undergraduate or\n\n441\n00:26:45.375 --> 00:26:47.875\nmaster's student on it,\nfound a flaw on his stuff.\n\n442\n00:26:48.965 --> 00:26:51.348\nYou never know who's\ngonna find this stuff.\n\n443\n00:26:51.348 --> 00:26:52.694\nNot to say that the guy wasn't bright.\n\n444\n00:26:52.694 --> 00:26:57.282\nNot to say that the undergraduate or\ngraduate student wasn't bright.\n\n445\n00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:58.270\nClearly he was.\n\n446\n00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.906\nYou know, it's just those set of\neyeballs have got it, it said hey,\n\n447\n00:27:01.906 --> 00:27:05.243\nI'm coming at it from a different\nangle I found this flaw in it.\n\n448\n00:27:05.243 --> 00:27:09.733\nThat's the other thing that can lead to an\nattack is that there may be a flaw in your\n\n449\n00:27:09.733 --> 00:27:13.670\nsystem that you didn't anticipate,\ndoesn't know it's there.\n\n450\n00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.730\n>> Yeah, it kind of goes into\nthe face of what you would\n\n451\n00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.810\nthink would be the best way to go,\nis this system admin, or a network admin?\n\n452\n00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:23.010\nWhen you're picking a solution, at first\nyou might think, well I'm gonna find one\n\n453\n00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:27.270\nthat's obscure, that nobody uses, and\nthat people know very little about.\n\n454\n00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.670\nThat's the one that's going to be more\nsecure, that's the one I want to use.\n\n455\n00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.380\nWhen it comes down to it,\nit's just the opposite of that.\n\n456\n00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:36.040\nYou want to use one that everybody knows\nabout, that everybody's had a chance to,\n\n457\n00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.330\nas you say, hammer on or do cryptanalysis\nagainst and make sure there's no flaws and\n\n458\n00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.950\nif there are, there patched up or\nthey're modified and\n\n459\n00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.630\nwe move to a new version of it.\n\n460\n00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.910\nThose are the ones you wanna use,\ncuz it's not the secrecy of the algorithm.\n\n461\n00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:53.503\nIt's the secrecy of the keys that you're\nusing with the algorithm, so you wanna use\n\n462\n00:27:53.503 --> 00:27:57.410\nthat known algorithm, and, again,\nto me, when you first think about it,\n\n463\n00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.380\nit's like wait, that goes against\neverything that makes sense.\n\n464\n00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.290\nI wanna use one that's secret.\n\n465\n00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.490\nBut that's not the case.\n\n466\n00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.340\n>> Yeah, it sounds completely\ncounterintuitive when you first hear it,\n\n467\n00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.750\nthat just putting those things out there\n\n468\n00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:15.730\nis gonna leave you wide open to someone\njust handing your backside to you.\n\n469\n00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.758\nBut it's not that way.\n\n470\n00:28:17.758 --> 00:28:22.270\nThose extra eyeballs\n\n471\n00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:27.210\ncould actually be other academic\nconcerned people looking at this.\n\n472\n00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:33.350\nAnd it's interesting to note that, for a\nlong time, algorithms were not considered\n\n473\n00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:38.490\nto be something that was fit for I'll say\npublic consumption for about seven years.\n\n474\n00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:39.960\nIf you can believe that.\n\n475\n00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:46.190\nThey used to say that if you\ngave birth to a algorithm today,\n\n476\n00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:50.170\nit was gonna be seven years before they\nwould actually consider it reliable enough\n\n477\n00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:54.800\nand been through enough scrutiny and been\nthrough its paces that they consider it\n\n478\n00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:00.310\nreliable, consistent, and secure,\nthat you can now use it in major products.\n\n479\n00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:04.660\nThat's been kind of scaled\nback a bit from tha,t but\n\n480\n00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.200\nthere still is a time period, you just\ndon't magically come up with an algorithm,\n\n481\n00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.380\nall of a sudden like hey that looks good,\nlet's use it over here.\n\n482\n00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.860\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n483\n00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.525\nUnless you just really don't care\nabout security all that much.\n\n484\n00:29:15.525 --> 00:29:17.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n485\n00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.160\nit's also worth noting Kerckhoffs's\nprinciple, like I said, it's just that.\n\n486\n00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.050\nIt's not a law, it's something that,\nit's really a suggestion.\n\n487\n00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.890\nThere's plenty of agencies out there and\norganizations that\n\n488\n00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.480\ndon't say one word about\nalgorithms that they design.\n\n489\n00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.460\nNSA's one of them.\n\n490\n00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.910\nNSA does not talk about\nthose types of things.\n\n491\n00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.770\nNSA is developing algorithms all the time.\n\n492\n00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:46.350\nThey've got a lot of extremely smart\npeople with the big craniums on and\n\n493\n00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:47.900\nthey're doing this stuff.\n\n494\n00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.970\nThen again,\nthey really don't need to go out there and\n\n495\n00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.926\nuse Kerckhoffs's principle\nin the general sense.\n\n496\n00:29:53.926 --> 00:29:56.587\nThey need to put it out on the internet\nand say yeah, here, go take a look at it.\n\n497\n00:29:56.587 --> 00:30:01.626\nThey've got like 50, 60 probably\npropeller heads, smart genius guys\n\n498\n00:30:01.626 --> 00:30:06.990\nin there that can, you know, scrutinize\nthe stuff between levitating tables.\n\n499\n00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.870\nI don't know.\nThey're just like, they've got that brain\n\n500\n00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:13.110\npower there, they just don't, they are not\nin the business of talking about it.\n\n501\n00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.130\nHow they work or anything like that.\n\n502\n00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.050\nThey're there.\n\n503\n00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.360\n>> All right, well Sean again,\nanother great episode.\n\n504\n00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.830\nA lot of great information\nabout crytographic attaks.\n\n505\n00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:26.580\nSome of the methods that people are trying\nto use to do that crypt analysis, against\n\n506\n00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.430\nour cryptographic solutions that we are\nputting in place to keep our network safe.\n\n507\n00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.870\nIt's important that we are aware of\nthem so, we can be better prepared and\n\n508\n00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:35.540\ndefend our networks against them.\n\n509\n00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.800\nSo, anything else we want to throw into\nthe steps here before we wrap it up.\n\n510\n00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.470\n>> The take away from this,\nwhether you remember the attacks or\n\n511\n00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.810\nnot, which you should remember\nthe attacks here these are the big ones.\n\n512\n00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:49.922\nBut, the big take away here is\nthat cryptography is not as used,\n\n513\n00:30:49.922 --> 00:30:51.902\nit's not that silver bullet,\n\n514\n00:30:51.902 --> 00:30:56.872\nit's not that cure all that's gonna\nmake everything all nice and all right.\n\n515\n00:30:56.872 --> 00:31:00.994\nIt is something that for\nall it's strengths, can be broken.\n\n516\n00:31:00.994 --> 00:31:05.750\nSo, you have to be prepared all the stuff,\nyou know, leads towards this is\n\n517\n00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:10.920\nthat you have to be prepared and\nunderstand so you do not become a victim.\n\n518\n00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.560\nDon't have a little\nsecurity blanket over you.\n\n519\n00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.700\nI always think of the kids.\n\n520\n00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.380\nIt's like oh,\nthere's somebody in the house.\n\n521\n00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.510\nIt's like pull the blanket up and\nyou can stop the ax murderer.\n\n522\n00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.937\nSorry, that was my thing.\n\n523\n00:31:20.937 --> 00:31:24.850\n>> [LAUGH] Now we know that's\nJohn's childhood nightmares.\n\n524\n00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.045\n>> Eh, you know.\n\n525\n00:31:26.045 --> 00:31:28.110\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\nwell ladies and gentlemen,\n\n526\n00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.630\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n527\n00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.180\nI know we enjoyed making it for you.\n\n528\n00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.970\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n529\n00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:34.950\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n530\n00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:36.895\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n531\n00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:41.410\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.310\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.330\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.896\n>> I'm doing pretty good\nhow you doing today?\n\n6\n00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:19.762\n>> Can't complain,\n\n7\n00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:23.127\nhere we are doing our CompTIA advanced\nsecurity practitioner episodes.\n\n8\n00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:26.430\nIn this one we're gonna be looking\nat advanced network design.\n\n9\n00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.500\nWays that we can design a network to\nhelp us keep that network secure.\n\n10\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.480\nSo what do you got for us there Sean?\n\n11\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.990\n>> Well there's plenty on the table for\nthis.\n\n12\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.490\nWe're going to, during this whole\njourney through network design,\n\n13\n00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.490\nwe're kinda gonna approach\nit a couple ways.\n\n14\n00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.910\nWe're gonna not only talk about the issues\nthat you're gonna have to deal with, but\n\n15\n00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.520\nwe'll also kinda try to roll in some\nof the other things that we've seen,\n\n16\n00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.370\nin maybe like the pen testing area.\n\n17\n00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.592\n>> To kinda show you what it\nlooks like from the other side,\n\n18\n00:00:56.592 --> 00:00:57.737\nto kinda act as a refresher.\n\n19\n00:00:57.737 --> 00:01:01.603\nBut also to kind of illustrate some of\nthe security issues that you're going to\n\n20\n00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:05.490\nbe dealing with in these designs,\nthe things you've gotta consider.\n\n21\n00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.560\nAnd I won't be showing all the toys\nin the toolbox that we have for\n\n22\n00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.520\npen testing, because we've been through\nthat but of course there's plenty more.\n\n23\n00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.390\nWe've always got something waiting.\n\n24\n00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.880\nBut we'll do that along the way, but\nwhat we have to start out with is, just\n\n25\n00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.710\nkinda set the stage here on what it means\nto have advanced network design, I think.\n\n26\n00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.310\nAnd that's a good place to start,\nand to me it sounds\n\n27\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.530\nfunny in the way they kinda come up to you\nand puts it in their body of knowledge.\n\n28\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.950\nThey say advanced network design.\n\n29\n00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.487\nIt's like okay, what does that mean?\n\n30\n00:01:38.487 --> 00:01:41.160\nI've been doing it longer\nthan someone else, or\n\n31\n00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.515\nI got a little certificate that says that.\n\n32\n00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:47.938\nWell, really, I like to think of it\njust as network design period, but\n\n33\n00:01:47.938 --> 00:01:51.110\nwhat they mean by saying\nadvanced network design Is\n\n34\n00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.310\ndealing with some of\nthe more modern issues.\n\n35\n00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.283\nCuz when you go back to some of\nthe CompTIA stuff like the Network+.\n\n36\n00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:01.270\nThe Network+ is still dealing with,\n\n37\n00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.910\neven though it's gotten to be more\ncomplex as the years have gone by,\n\n38\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.005\nit's still dealing with a lot of the basic\nnetwork issues that we have out there.\n\n39\n00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:14.080\nIt really hasn't, it doesn't deal\nwith the more complex things and\n\n40\n00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.180\ndefinitely doesn't put too much\nof the security stuff in there.\n\n41\n00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.510\nSo we're really looking at\nhaving the network, and\n\n42\n00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.470\nthen incorporating some of the stuff\nthat has emerged in the workplace.\n\n43\n00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.450\nAnd emerged from other angles that are\ndefinitely gonna impact your design, or\n\n44\n00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.328\nthat you can't leave out, or\nyou'll be in a lot of trouble if you do.\n\n45\n00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:38.090\n>> So what are some of the new devices,\nor I wouldn't say new, but\n\n46\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.840\nmore modern devices that\nwe might implement?\n\n47\n00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.390\nVersus say I'm thinking like\na simple network that's just\n\n48\n00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.500\na switch and some nodes.\n\n49\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.560\nSo what do we bring in to make the more\ncomplex design that gives us that\n\n50\n00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.140\nsecurity?\n\n51\n00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.480\n>> Well what's really kind of changed the\nlandscape for us, and made it so we have\n\n52\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.220\nto put in the category of advanced network\ndesign is, it is these modern devices.\n\n53\n00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.781\nThese modern devices are things that give\na lot of intelligence, a lot of utility,\n\n54\n00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:11.000\nand just a lot of scalability and all the\nother stuff you want to throw in there.\n\n55\n00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.586\nThey've really kind of made\nmodern networks just much more\n\n56\n00:03:14.586 --> 00:03:16.169\npowerful than they were.\n\n57\n00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:21.081\nMuch easier, I don't know there's probably\na good amount of system administrators out\n\n58\n00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:22.272\nthere freaking out.\n\n59\n00:03:22.272 --> 00:03:24.833\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Oh from what I heard 16th\n\n60\n00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:28.750\nis System Admins' Appreciation Day,\nso I appreciate you guys.\n\n61\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n62\n00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.068\nwhen I'm harassing you as a pen tester,\nremember, I appreciate you.\n\n63\n00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:38.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But why not get a pen tester day?\n\n64\n00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.488\n>> Right.\n\n65\n00:03:40.488 --> 00:03:42.566\n>> Oh that's right we can add that\ninto the calendar whenever we want.\n\n66\n00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:46.838\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But modern devices,\n\n67\n00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:52.819\nwe've got everything from\nthe infrastructure that people don't see,\n\n68\n00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.439\nto stuff like,\nI would still throw firewalls in there.\n\n69\n00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.560\nIDSs, IPSs,\nwireless definitely is gonna be in there.\n\n70\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.876\nThat's just some of\nthe hardware/software stuff, but\n\n71\n00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:08.785\nthere's plenty of other\nthings that go in there.\n\n72\n00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:12.487\nAnd there's plenty of things that\nwe've learned over the years,\n\n73\n00:04:12.487 --> 00:04:15.860\neither just because we've\npredicted stuff ahead of time and\n\n74\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.590\nwe're smart enough to\nput the things in place.\n\n75\n00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.970\nOr we learn the hard way and had to put\nsome of these technologies in place and\n\n76\n00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.010\ndevelop new technologies,\njust to kind of close the barn door\n\n77\n00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.220\nafter everything's all left.\n\n78\n00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.240\nSo you really are gonna be coming\ninto it with a modern network.\n\n79\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.370\nYou're gonna be coming into a workplace\nthat's gonna have all sorts of devices\n\n80\n00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.920\nthat are gonna cause you so\nmany issues, so many problems.\n\n81\n00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.260\nAnd I hate to say that, but\n\n82\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.540\nthey are gonna be a lot of problems\nthat are gonna come up there.\n\n83\n00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.640\nI mean just look at things\nlike smartphones and tablets.\n\n84\n00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.163\nThose are something that people not only\nstore their whole lives on, but something\n\n85\n00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:04.122\nthat they carry around with them, and\nthey carry all sorts of data on it.\n\n86\n00:05:04.122 --> 00:05:09.500\nAnd they can get lost,\nthey can mix and commingle personal\n\n87\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.260\nwith company data and\nall sorts of things can happen there.\n\n88\n00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.100\nThat's something that we haven't\nhad to deal with in the past.\n\n89\n00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.940\nIt wasn't, the most you had to deal with\nsomeone bringing in their notebook, and\n\n90\n00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.800\nthat landscape's changed dramatically.\n\n91\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.657\nThey keep saying that the laptops\nare gonna go away in favor of\n\n92\n00:05:32.657 --> 00:05:34.856\nsmartphones and tablets.\n\n93\n00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:38.170\nMaybe they will eventually, but\nI don't think it's as imminent as the way\n\n94\n00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.656\nthey make it, but it used to be those are\nall things that you had to worry about.\n\n95\n00:05:41.656 --> 00:05:44.869\nNow, you got these other\nthings brought into play\n\n96\n00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:47.711\nthat bring in all sorts\nof issues with them.\n\n97\n00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:51.248\nHow do you manage them,\nhow do you secure them, and\n\n98\n00:05:51.248 --> 00:05:53.811\nhow do you even keep track of things?\n\n99\n00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:59.180\nThere's just a whole bunch of things\nthat are gonna come around that.\n\n100\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.690\nAnd that's so, when we talk advanced\nnetwork design, that's what it is,\n\n101\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.370\nit's introducing new things, and being\nadaptable to deal with new stuff in there.\n\n102\n00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.260\n>> So we'll put our firewalls in there,\nour intrusion detection devices in there.\n\n103\n00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.030\nWhere do we go from there?\n\n104\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.690\n>> You name it.\n\n105\n00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.021\nAnything, it's stuff like that,\nthe firewalls, the IDSs,\n\n106\n00:06:22.021 --> 00:06:26.960\nthe routers,\nthe wireless access points just for local.\n\n107\n00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.610\nAnd then there's also even dealing\nwith stuff that campus area, wireless\n\n108\n00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.780\nnetworks that have come into play, because\nwireless has been a big game changer.\n\n109\n00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.523\nSo we've now got those things\ncovering very large areas.\n\n110\n00:06:41.523 --> 00:06:44.739\nSo that's something that you wouldn't\nhave had to deal with a few years ago.\n\n111\n00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:49.627\nBut now you definitely have to deal with\nthem, and that's not even a case where\n\n112\n00:06:49.627 --> 00:06:54.609\nyou have just a single access point that's\ngot a lot of power being put out on it.\n\n113\n00:06:54.609 --> 00:06:59.186\nYou're talking something that is scaled\nup to even being a mesh network now.\n\n114\n00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:03.630\nSo that's something that\nyou wouldn't have had to\n\n115\n00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.170\ndeal with several years ago, but\nyou're going to deal with it now.\n\n116\n00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.150\nIt's something that has\nbecome easier to set up,\n\n117\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.760\nand something that you're going to\nencounter, if you don't already.\n\n118\n00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.778\nSame thing goes for other stuff too.\n\n119\n00:07:17.778 --> 00:07:25.151\nIt's like, clustering, heck, you've\nbeen doing this for a long time too.\n\n120\n00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:29.584\nRemember like the Microsoft when they\nfirst started pushing clustering,\n\n121\n00:07:29.584 --> 00:07:33.184\nit was like, no, no,\nthere's a topic called clustering.\n\n122\n00:07:33.184 --> 00:07:36.001\nBut there's a whole other\nset of classes for that,\n\n123\n00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:38.108\nthat we don't teach you that in here.\n\n124\n00:07:38.108 --> 00:07:41.664\nAnd it wasn't a much requested class,\nbecause people just don't want\n\n125\n00:07:41.664 --> 00:07:46.063\nto mess with it, and there's just too much\ngoing on there, it's not that way anymore.\n\n126\n00:07:46.063 --> 00:07:50.179\nYou can do it much,\nmuch easier than you could before so\n\n127\n00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:52.785\nnow you're seeing those emerge.\n\n128\n00:07:52.785 --> 00:07:58.149\nThe high availability\nissue is something that\n\n129\n00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:02.970\nis being addressed much more head on now.\n\n130\n00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.700\nSo you've got clustering coming up,\nall sorts of redundancy things,\n\n131\n00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.686\nit's easier to make server farms and\nall that now.\n\n132\n00:08:11.686 --> 00:08:17.180\nSo you keep going on and on and on, you\nguys [LAUGH] probably have a whole bunch\n\n133\n00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:22.400\nof ones that you could throw into this\nmix even that you're going to encounter.\n\n134\n00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.060\n>> All right, so let's talk about,\nI don't know, IPv6.\n\n135\n00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.090\nThere's another thing that we can\nbring into our modern networks that\n\n136\n00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.290\ngives another level of security.\n\n137\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.380\n>> Yeah, that's one of the other big\nthings that's depending on who you talk\n\n138\n00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:39.050\nto, either it's on the horizon,\nway over the horizon and down\n\n139\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.990\nlike a whole bunch of stuff and it's out\npast the new horizon's probe out there.\n\n140\n00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.390\nAnd then there's some people that\nare right in the thick of it,\n\n141\n00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.340\nit all really depends.\n\n142\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.970\nSo IP6 is one of those things\nthat it promises better security,\n\n143\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.870\nit does deliver a better security and\nreally when you get down to it,\n\n144\n00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.290\nand I know probably some people\nare gonna scream at this, but\n\n145\n00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.500\nit's really not that difficult,\nit's really not.\n\n146\n00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.660\nIt's something that's different.\n\n147\n00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.480\nIt's probably not any harder, and\nI know this is kind of a little bit of\n\n148\n00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.470\na stretcher, it's probably harder\nI would say to get into IP6 and\n\n149\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.580\nget a command of it than it was to for\na lot of us to learn IP4 the first time.\n\n150\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.504\nA lot of us learned IP4 and then they\nstarted saying let's do this in binary and\n\n151\n00:09:25.504 --> 00:09:26.771\nwe're like let's not.\n\n152\n00:09:26.771 --> 00:09:27.810\n[LAUGH] And\n\n153\n00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.175\nsubheading all that stuff, it was a lot of\nstuff that just caused us a lot of grief.\n\n154\n00:09:32.175 --> 00:09:38.322\nYou know what, whoever hear about people\ndoing like five day courses on TCPIP?\n\n155\n00:09:38.322 --> 00:09:42.130\nThey're spending like eight,\nnine hours a day just doing that.\n\n156\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.760\nI mean, you insane?\n\n157\n00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.205\nI would not do that now.\n\n158\n00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:48.755\n[LAUGH] I wouldn't teach that for\nfive days.\n\n159\n00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:49.368\n[LAUGH] So\n\n160\n00:09:49.368 --> 00:09:55.073\nit's a crazy thing to consider that\nthat's what they had to do at some point.\n\n161\n00:09:55.073 --> 00:09:59.285\nIP6, yeah, they do,\nI've seen classroom training,\n\n162\n00:09:59.285 --> 00:10:04.285\nthat's a lot shorter and the books\nyou see on it and stuff like that,\n\n163\n00:10:04.285 --> 00:10:09.462\nyeah, they do get into some of those\nreally fine details but overall,\n\n164\n00:10:09.462 --> 00:10:15.428\nit's not really that tough, it's just\na lot of people don't wanna get into it or\n\n165\n00:10:15.428 --> 00:10:21.770\njust don't have the money to implement\nit yet or the manpower to implement it.\n\n166\n00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.900\nSo it's something that is definitely\ncoming into your environment.\n\n167\n00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.430\nIf it's not already there,\nit's going to be there and\n\n168\n00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.110\nyou're gonna have to deal with that too.\n\n169\n00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.350\nThat's a whole another level\nof things that come onto this,\n\n170\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:40.210\nbecause IP4 is gonna go away not\nany time soon, but it will go away.\n\n171\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.305\nYou know, I'll be retired by then.\n\n172\n00:10:42.305 --> 00:10:45.931\n[LAUGH] My grandkids will be retired\nby then, if I had grandkids.\n\n173\n00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:51.071\n>> [LAUGH] It does provide another layer\nof security with IPv6 we've got things\n\n174\n00:10:51.071 --> 00:10:56.705\nlike IP6 built in to it, where it's not\nshoehorned in like it was even with IPv4.\n\n175\n00:10:56.705 --> 00:10:59.370\nA lot of that security stuff\nwas put in after the fact.\n\n176\n00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.688\nIPv6 has all that built into\nit ready to rock and roll.\n\n177\n00:11:02.688 --> 00:11:06.245\nYeah, I always thought of it as funny,\nyou use the term shoehorned and\n\n178\n00:11:06.245 --> 00:11:10.040\nI look at is as they just kind of took\nIP4 and when they were designing IP6,\n\n179\n00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.715\nit's like it would be a great idea to\nhave that stuff over here in IP4, so\n\n180\n00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.993\nthey took it over there and\nduct taped it on.\n\n181\n00:11:15.993 --> 00:11:20.395\n[LAUGH] That's the way I always think\nabout it because it's like it's there, but\n\n182\n00:11:20.395 --> 00:11:23.195\nit's not really there,\nit's just like present.\n\n183\n00:11:23.195 --> 00:11:28.104\nBut not to bash on it, [LAUGH] but\nit's something I've noticed.\n\n184\n00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:32.477\nBut in any case.\n\n185\n00:11:32.477 --> 00:11:34.375\n>> [LAUGH] We handed\nin our mobile devices,\n\n186\n00:11:34.375 --> 00:11:37.150\nanother thing that's definitely\nchanged in our network today.\n\n187\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.525\nOur landscape of our corporate\nenvironments, more and\n\n188\n00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:44.617\nmore mobile devices, tablets,\nlaptops, all the smartphones and\n\n189\n00:11:44.617 --> 00:11:48.082\nit's amazing what you can do\nwith some of these devices.\n\n190\n00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:51.196\nThey're as powerful as\ncomputers we used to have and\n\n191\n00:11:51.196 --> 00:11:55.668\nI could put the same tools on these\nphones that I would on an attack machine.\n\n192\n00:11:55.668 --> 00:11:58.750\nSo it's something else that\nwe've gotta deal with, right?\n\n193\n00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.370\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n194\n00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.560\nIt's funny that you say the stuff\n[LAUGH] that you can do with this.\n\n195\n00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.560\nCoincidentally, normal phone,\nit's a Nexus 5.\n\n196\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.680\nIt's not exactly new.\n\n197\n00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.530\nI was showing everyone here\nyesterday before we went on the air.\n\n198\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.230\nThis is actually an extremely\npowerful pen testing device.\n\n199\n00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:26.900\nI could ruin your day with this thing,\nand it's a working cell phone.\n\n200\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:32.270\nI mean it's got everything in it and all\nthat, but it's been rooted, unlocked, and\n\n201\n00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.480\nit has a whole bunch of custom tools from\nthe deep dark corners of the internet and\n\n202\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.650\nother places.\n\n203\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.380\nAnd I can do countless\nthings to ruin your day,\n\n204\n00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.890\nincluding social engineering\nattacks with this.\n\n205\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.400\nThere's actually stuff\non there to do this.\n\n206\n00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.546\nI have Metasploit loaded on this, and\n\n207\n00:12:47.546 --> 00:12:52.150\nsome other interesting toys that maybe\nwe'll [LAUGH] get into at some point.\n\n208\n00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:58.245\nBut think about it, this is something\nthat's way out classes something like\n\n209\n00:12:58.245 --> 00:13:03.310\nthat pone pad or just typical\nKaylee Linux and anybody else looking at\n\n210\n00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:09.170\nthis I could be sitting here talking\non the phone and texting or whatever.\n\n211\n00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:13.490\nI've got something that's actually\nsweeping your network and\n\n212\n00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.010\ndoing all sorts of nasty stuff.\n\n213\n00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.650\nI mean this thing can even,\nI was showing one of them here.\n\n214\n00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.160\nI was showing how this thing actually\ncan automatically, get this,\n\n215\n00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.080\nI've got a tool on here that can\nautomatically break wireless.\n\n216\n00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.700\nAll I have to do is just start it and\nsingle out a network, and\n\n217\n00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.310\nkeep talking and doing whatever I'm doing,\nor I can just throw it in my pocket.\n\n218\n00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:39.790\nIt will continue the process of trying\nto capture handshakes and packets and\n\n219\n00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:45.890\nkick back the actual key without me doing\nanything except start the whole thing up.\n\n220\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:46.950\n>> Yeah.\n>> So yeah,\n\n221\n00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.980\nthat's the dangers you're\ndealing with is is that\n\n222\n00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.220\nyou have people bringing these things in,\nbut what's on these things?\n\n223\n00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:00.028\nYou probably do not want me as an employee\nbringing this thing into your network\n\n224\n00:14:00.028 --> 00:14:05.570\nbecause I introduced this in there\nas a phone but what else is there?\n\n225\n00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.740\nYou know, I would be concerned about this.\n\n226\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.940\n>> Are there ways we can protect our\nnetworks against those kinds of things or?\n\n227\n00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.389\n>> Yeah, don't be in the building.\n\n228\n00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:19.080\nYeah, there's ways to protect\nagainst these type of things.\n\n229\n00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.190\nIt's really going to come down to you\nknow some of the counter measures we\n\n230\n00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.990\ntalked about in the pen testing course.\n\n231\n00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.960\nYou know when we talked about\nthe whole alpha ethical hacking stuff.\n\n232\n00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:34.440\nYou use some of those things and\nthen there's the other typical and\n\n233\n00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:40.750\nusual suspects would be in play but\nthen, there's only so much you can do.\n\n234\n00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.920\nEspecially if I can get that inside and\non your network or\n\n235\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.090\nbreak into it using that,\nI've made a lot of headway and\n\n236\n00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:54.794\nI can get really far in before you're\nactually going to be able to pick me up.\n\n237\n00:14:54.794 --> 00:14:59.658\nI mean, I've got stuff in there I can\ndo some severe levels of damage to\n\n238\n00:14:59.658 --> 00:15:03.060\nyou before you're going\nto know it's there.\n\n239\n00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.880\nAnd what I did, I mean I specced\nout that phone with the tools and\n\n240\n00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.890\neverything that I wanted, but it's not\nsomething that I've got some special\n\n241\n00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.140\nmagical ability to create that thing.\n\n242\n00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.220\nSomeone else could do\nthe exact same thing I did.\n\n243\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.230\nI just planned that thing out for\nseveral months on, and collecting tools,\n\n244\n00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.140\nstuff that you couldn't get through the\nnormal places and stuff like that and had\n\n245\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.690\nfriends even program [LAUGH] some stuff\nfor me and had that stuff put on there.\n\n246\n00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.984\nSo yeah, there's, you can get that, you\ncan actually have those things pop up on\n\n247\n00:15:30.984 --> 00:15:34.906\nyour network and someone can do some\npretty nasty with it, with very little\n\n248\n00:15:34.906 --> 00:15:38.851\neffort amazingly, very little effort\nthey can carry out a lot of attacks.\n\n249\n00:15:38.851 --> 00:15:41.946\nAnd just the fact that I can sit there and\ntalk on the thing, or\n\n250\n00:15:41.946 --> 00:15:45.832\nthrow it out of my pocket while I'm on\nyour premises talking, you go, hey,\n\n251\n00:15:45.832 --> 00:15:49.338\ncan I use your bathroom or something,\nthis thing is messing you up.\n\n252\n00:15:49.338 --> 00:15:53.768\n>> [LAUGH] So we would definitely see an\nincrease then in the The type of threats\n\n253\n00:15:53.768 --> 00:15:57.210\nthat we have to face when\nwe're designing our networks.\n\n254\n00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.995\n>> Yeah, you wouldn't have had to\ndeal with that just a few years ago.\n\n255\n00:16:00.995 --> 00:16:05.971\nThat would've been something that's, yeah,\nyou would have had seen someone carrying\n\n256\n00:16:05.971 --> 00:16:10.750\ntheir notebook around to do that or\nhave that in their backpack or something.\n\n257\n00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.350\nIt's pretty easy to see that.\n\n258\n00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.040\nBut, that's a normal device.\n\n259\n00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.900\nThat's something that someone carrying\naround a smartphone is not out\n\n260\n00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.630\nof the ordinary by any means.\n\n261\n00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.770\nIt's something that is a standard device.\n\n262\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.335\nThey're ubiquitous.\n\n263\n00:16:26.335 --> 00:16:29.859\nPretty much everyone has\na cell phone nowadays, and\n\n264\n00:16:29.859 --> 00:16:34.840\nthey pretty much all look somewhat\nlike that, a smartphone of some type.\n\n265\n00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.830\nNot everyone, but it's common\nenough that it's gonna slip by.\n\n266\n00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.720\n>> So this really comes down to\nsecuring our wireless network then.\n\n267\n00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.250\nMaking sure you just can't\nget access to that network.\n\n268\n00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:49.490\n>> Your wireless, your physical network,\na bunch of things, that\n\n269\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:56.660\ndevice, I even have the ability to,\nwith just a regular micro USB\n\n270\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:01.520\ncable like you'd use to do data transfers\nbetween the computer and the device.\n\n271\n00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.166\nI can boot the computer off of that.\n\n272\n00:17:03.166 --> 00:17:07.600\nI can do a live boot directly off that and\nload that onto any one of your machines.\n\n273\n00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.350\nSo now I've turned something that\nwould be over wireless, and that would\n\n274\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:16.760\ninclude Bluetooth too cuz that one can\nhit Bluetooth from about 1,000 feet away.\n\n275\n00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.675\nSo, not only can I do that, I can also\nplug it into your computer, or physically,\n\n276\n00:17:21.675 --> 00:17:26.308\nand boot it off that, and boot Kali or\nwhatever distro Linux on that system and\n\n277\n00:17:26.308 --> 00:17:28.900\nnow start messing with it from the inside.\n\n278\n00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:34.422\nAnd so it's not [LAUGH] just\nthat simple to just look at and\n\n279\n00:17:34.422 --> 00:17:37.015\nclassify it as one thing.\n\n280\n00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:38.570\nYou can hit it from a number of areas.\n\n281\n00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.644\nAnd the fact that I can do social\nengineering from that too,\n\n282\n00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:45.474\nI can send out mass amounts of emails\nthat have exploits attached to them.\n\n283\n00:17:45.474 --> 00:17:50.213\nAnd there's even text messages I can drop\noff and crash certain devices off off it.\n\n284\n00:17:50.213 --> 00:17:52.005\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, it's pretty nasty.\n\n285\n00:17:53.685 --> 00:17:55.610\n>> All right so, where does that leave us?\n\n286\n00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.345\nWhere do we really focus our security?\n\n287\n00:17:57.345 --> 00:17:58.535\nWhere do we put this kind of stuff?\n\n288\n00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:04.840\n>> Your security is something that if our\n\n289\n00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.520\nexamination of doing ethical hacking,\nwe can bring that into play.\n\n290\n00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.588\nIf you look at something like that, and\nthen look at what we did with Kali and\n\n291\n00:18:12.588 --> 00:18:14.710\nstuff like Metasploit plus other stuff.\n\n292\n00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:19.373\nI mean, so you really kinda gotta look\nat those things, understand them,\n\n293\n00:18:19.373 --> 00:18:23.816\nto really kind of get a good understanding\nof where you're gonna have to\n\n294\n00:18:23.816 --> 00:18:28.059\nplace your security and\nwhat types of security you're gonna need.\n\n295\n00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:32.771\nOne of things we're trying to avoid at\nthis level with the CASP versus what\n\n296\n00:18:32.771 --> 00:18:34.905\nthe Security Plus taught us.\n\n297\n00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:39.985\nSecurity Plus is a good\ncredential to hold for security.\n\n298\n00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:42.710\nHowever, it is a beginning credential.\n\n299\n00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:46.675\nIt's kind of just like\na shotgun approach to security.\n\n300\n00:18:46.675 --> 00:18:50.190\nIt tells you what security is and\ngives you a taste of it, but\n\n301\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:55.750\nit doesn't go too far into letting you\nunderstand how serious the threats are and\n\n302\n00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.200\nwhat they look like.\n\n303\n00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.192\nAnd when you get to this level,\nyou need to understand those threats.\n\n304\n00:19:01.192 --> 00:19:06.229\nYou need to know what type of risks you\nhave and how to assess that risk, and\n\n305\n00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:11.268\nthen apply the appropriate corrective\nmeasures to bring that risk down or\n\n306\n00:19:11.268 --> 00:19:14.200\ndo your risk mitigation as they call it.\n\n307\n00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.766\nIt's gonna be an ongoing process.\n\n308\n00:19:15.766 --> 00:19:20.605\nIf we've learned anything, it's something\nthat is, it's an ongoing cycle,\n\n309\n00:19:20.605 --> 00:19:23.320\nwe're constantly doing risk assessments.\n\n310\n00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.330\nWe're constantly looking at things,\nchecking logs,\n\n311\n00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.320\nand all the other stuff that goes with it.\n\n312\n00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.585\nYou're bringing in people like me that,\nI am a pen tester.\n\n313\n00:19:31.585 --> 00:19:36.590\nI'm going to work with you to find\nthose holes before someone else does.\n\n314\n00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.870\nSo, that's gonna be part of it.\n\n315\n00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.212\nYou also need to keep\nup on what the news is.\n\n316\n00:19:42.212 --> 00:19:46.708\nWhen you start seeing what's coming across\nin the news, that's gonna also give you\n\n317\n00:19:46.708 --> 00:19:50.014\nsome insight to the types of\nattacks that are also happening.\n\n318\n00:19:50.014 --> 00:19:54.422\nWe've had some pretty good ones\nrecently or pretty bad ones,\n\n319\n00:19:54.422 --> 00:19:57.812\ndepending on what side\nof the fence you're on,\n\n320\n00:19:57.812 --> 00:20:01.995\nthat can tell you the types\nof stuff they're going after.\n\n321\n00:20:01.995 --> 00:20:07.320\nWe're seeing increased attacks with\ndatabases, with web applications.\n\n322\n00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.399\nI mean, some of you may have even been\nimpacted by the one that hit the,\n\n323\n00:20:11.399 --> 00:20:14.807\nhere in the States,\nthe Office of Personnel Management.\n\n324\n00:20:14.807 --> 00:20:18.802\nThat made the news only a couple\nweeks ago, [SOUND] yeah,\n\n325\n00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:20.587\na couple weeks or so ago.\n\n326\n00:20:20.587 --> 00:20:25.520\nThat happened a ways back, but\nit only made the news a little while ago.\n\n327\n00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.201\nThey actually said that there's\na good percentage of Americans,\n\n328\n00:20:29.201 --> 00:20:31.312\nI wanna say the number's about 7%?\n\n329\n00:20:31.312 --> 00:20:32.100\nIs that the one they said?\n\n330\n00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.712\nAbout 7% of Americans have been hit\nby that strike against our Office of\n\n331\n00:20:36.712 --> 00:20:38.580\nPersonnel Management.\n\n332\n00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.650\nAnd that includes stuff\nthat you would get for\n\n333\n00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:45.450\nsecurity clearances like top secret and\nsecret security clearances.\n\n334\n00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:46.920\nThey've got that information.\n\n335\n00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.360\nThey've got the information, if you apply\nfor security clearance, family members,\n\n336\n00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.150\nto see what their backgrounds are,\nthey have those people's things.\n\n337\n00:20:54.150 --> 00:21:01.939\nAnd then they even have, there's a small\nportion of the data that was captured.\n\n338\n00:21:01.939 --> 00:21:07.859\n1.1 million records in there contain\nactual biometric stuff, finger prints.\n\n339\n00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:09.797\nAnd think about how serious that is.\n\n340\n00:21:09.797 --> 00:21:13.060\nI can change your password.\n\n341\n00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.380\nI can reissue you smart cards and\nstuff like that for you.\n\n342\n00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.760\nBut I can't cut off your fingers and\n\n343\n00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.800\nput new ones on there because someone's\nstolen copies of your fingerprints.\n\n344\n00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.480\nIt wouldn't be too hard for someone to\nmodel those things and impersonate you.\n\n345\n00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.670\nSo, it's a pretty scary one, but\n\n346\n00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:33.740\nthat shows you how sophisticated\nthe attacks are getting.\n\n347\n00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.680\nAnd even that's just such a small part\nof the equation that's happening so.\n\n348\n00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.428\n>> All right, really have to stay on our\ntoes and keep up with the latest and\n\n349\n00:21:41.428 --> 00:21:45.570\ngreatest in security, so that we can\ntry to stay ahead of those bad guys.\n\n350\n00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.200\n>> Yeah, it's a very,\nvery tough proposition,\n\n351\n00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.680\nand no one's saying it's gonna be easy.\n\n352\n00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:57.630\nBut, it's something that you're gonna\nhave to keep on top of yourself,\n\n353\n00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:02.650\nand as well as enlist other people\nwithin your company or even an outside\n\n354\n00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.720\nindividual to work with to make sure\nyou have a good security solution.\n\n355\n00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.720\nBecause, when we're talking about stuff\nthat deals with advanced network design,\n\n356\n00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.390\nwhen you throw that word advance\ninto there, we're pretty much ruled\n\n357\n00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.450\nout the fact that this is something that\nyou can take care of all on your own.\n\n358\n00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:21.085\nYou're talking stuff that's a mid to\nenterprise level network with all or\n\n359\n00:22:21.085 --> 00:22:24.101\na good part of bells and\nwhistles in there, and so\n\n360\n00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:26.174\nyou're not doing it on your own.\n\n361\n00:22:26.174 --> 00:22:28.887\nWhich means you're gonna have to have\na team to also assess all the threats\n\n362\n00:22:28.887 --> 00:22:31.700\nbecause you can't be familiar\nwith all the technology.\n\n363\n00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.355\nIn fact, when you start getting up\nto where the CASP wants you to be,\n\n364\n00:22:35.355 --> 00:22:39.349\nyou're starting to move away from\nthe technology, the day to day stuff.\n\n365\n00:22:39.349 --> 00:22:42.963\nYou're not doing the operational stuff,\n\n366\n00:22:42.963 --> 00:22:47.840\nyou're doing more the mid to\nlong-term type of issues.\n\n367\n00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:53.240\nSo, its a tricky proposition at best,\nbut it can be manageable.\n\n368\n00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.500\nYou'll never be completely on top of it.\n\n369\n00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.189\nBut, you can manage it, and\nthat's about as much as you can ask.\n\n370\n00:22:59.189 --> 00:23:00.173\n>> All right, good.\n\n371\n00:23:00.173 --> 00:23:02.070\nAll right,\nwell great information there, Sean.\n\n372\n00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:06.600\nA lot of info to help us set up that\nadvanced network design to try to keep our\n\n373\n00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.490\nnetwork safe.\n\n374\n00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.193\nSo anything else we wanna throw in\nhere before we wrap this one up?\n\n375\n00:23:10.193 --> 00:23:13.143\nI think that kinda gets\nthe point across is that yeah,\n\n376\n00:23:13.143 --> 00:23:17.606\nwe're talking about the heavyweights,\nand the networking side of things, and\n\n377\n00:23:17.606 --> 00:23:22.132\nthe more complex scenarios we're gonna\nencounter, and that we have to address at\n\n378\n00:23:22.132 --> 00:23:26.110\nleast a little bit we're gonna have\nto address as a security manager.\n\n379\n00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.680\nWe're gonna delve deeper into that.\n\n380\n00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.450\nSo, yeah, that's where we're headed,\nthe more advanced stuff.\n\n381\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:32.943\nWe're not just stringing wires anymore.\n\n382\n00:23:32.943 --> 00:23:35.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] We're doing way more than that.\n\n383\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.630\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen that's gonna do it for this one.\n\n384\n00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.100\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n385\n00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.140\n>> And I'm Shawn Ariano.\n\n386\n00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.322\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n387\n00:23:42.322 --> 00:23:48.510\n[SOUND]\n\n",

and\n\n3\n00:00:13.982 --> 00:00:15.621\nwith me today is Mr. Shawn Oriano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:16.670\nHow are you doing Shawn?\n\n5\n00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.350\n>> I am doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.770\n>> I am doing great, excited to be here,\n\n7\n00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.840\nwe're doing another one of our CompTA\nadvanced security practitioner episodes.\n\n8\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.230\nAnd in this one,\nwe’re gonna be covering remote access.\n\n9\n00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.460\nSo this is a concept that,\nat this point in our careers, studying for\n\n10\n00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.350\nthis exam,\nwe’re familiar with what remote access is.\n\n11\n00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.730\nBut now we gotta take a look\nat securing remote access, and\n\n12\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.820\nmaking sure that it’s done\nin a secure fashion, right?\n\n13\n00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.280\n>> Yeah, that’s really the name\nof the game, remote access.\n\n14\n00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.140\nIt isn’t gonna go away and\nI don’t think anyone expects it too.\n\n15\n00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.990\nIt’s just a question of using\nthe right type of remote access,\n\n16\n00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.430\nand making sure that whatever remote\naccess you do choose to use ultimately,\n\n17\n00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.780\nis gonna be acceptable from\nthe risks you defined.\n\n18\n00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.945\nLike we said,\nnothing's ever gonna be free of risk,\n\n19\n00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:04.505\nit's just a question of how much\nare you willing to tolerate.\n\n20\n00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:08.175\nAnd also you know sometimes it's\njust a technical limitation too.\n\n21\n00:01:08.175 --> 00:01:11.955\nSometimes you'd really rather\nnot tolerate that risk but\n\n22\n00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:15.075\nyou've got a bunch of legacy stuff out\nthere that there's really no other\n\n23\n00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:20.045\noption and sure there's a number of\npeople you know watching this or\n\n24\n00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:24.500\nhere you can even say that,\nI know I can say that myself that.\n\n25\n00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.420\nHey, get rid of that,\nlet's get rid of whatever that is and\n\n26\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.410\nreplace it with this like not that easy.\n\n27\n00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.450\nSo we are gonna keep that in mind,\n\n28\n00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.300\neven when we badmouth [LAUGH]\nsome of these technologies.\n\n29\n00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.782\n>> Starting with my favorite telnet,\nI mean, that's what I use for everything.\n\n30\n00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:41.665\nThere's nothing wrong with that, right?\n\n31\n00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:45.200\n>> Yeah, absolutely nothing.\n\n32\n00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.080\nTelnet's one of the dependable old\nstandbys that's, it's been around forever.\n\n33\n00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.280\nIt works great, does a good job but\n\n34\n00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.540\nI don't think anyone's\nreally arguing with that.\n\n35\n00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.890\nIt's just a question of\nin today's market place.\n\n36\n00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.140\nIt's really, really, really insecure.\n\n37\n00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.070\nIt's like you might as well write\nyour stuff on the wall some place.\n\n38\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.960\nThey say, here you go if you want to\nuse it because it's literally that\n\n39\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.120\neasy to view the stuff.\n\n40\n00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.140\nBut it's also worth noting that\nthere's plenty of places that still\n\n41\n00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.860\nuse that technology.\n\n42\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.230\nAnd they have to use it for\nlegacy reasons.\n\n43\n00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.720\nThere's even new technologist coming out\nthat still recommending that you use that.\n\n44\n00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.120\nYou can see they mention\n\n45\n00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.810\nthat in some case you'll see it mentioned\nwith a even android devices I mentioned,\n\n46\n00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.634\njust telnet in and do this,\nit's like, why are you doing that?\n\n47\n00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:37.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like whoa stop it.\n\n48\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.750\nJust don't do that.\n\n49\n00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.210\nYeah, so it's still something that's\n\n50\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.080\nyou know pushed around all the time and\nmentioned all the time.\n\n51\n00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.780\nThey're trying to discourage\npeople's usage of it but\n\n52\n00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.240\nit's still gonna be out there.\n\n53\n00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.530\nI mean, you look at Microsoft.\n\n54\n00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.310\nWhat has Microsoft done for the last,\nwhat, two, three releases, whatever,\n\n55\n00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.910\nof Windows?\n\n56\n00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.310\nThey've said, oh, yeah, we're just\ngonna take that telnet client out and\n\n57\n00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.580\nput it over here.\n\n58\n00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.990\nThat way it'll be more secure.\n\n59\n00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.700\nWhat do people do?\n\n60\n00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.030\nIt's supposed to be there, check a box,\ndownload it, it's back in there.\n\n61\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.950\nSo It's just not something that's\ngonna go away anytime soon.\n\n62\n00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.910\nBut really what is telnet, I guess, just\nto make sure we're all on the same page,\n\n63\n00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.410\nit really is remote access utility.\n\n64\n00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.520\nIt's for command line access.\n\n65\n00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.320\nYou're not getting any more than that.\n\n66\n00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.830\nAnd so you can log into various\nservices or whatever remotely.\n\n67\n00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.570\nYou need to transfer files or\nyou can issue commands to a system.\n\n68\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.640\nYou can do various things with it.\n\n69\n00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.220\nIt's very simple and it works.\n\n70\n00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.080\nThat's why it has been around forever and\n\n71\n00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.530\nit's just stuck around because\nthere's not much really to go wrong.\n\n72\n00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.490\n>> I've had people ask me,\nwhy would anybody ever use telnet,\n\n73\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.870\nwhy is it still there?\n\n74\n00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.950\nAnd I'll tell them, well maybe I'm not\nusing it to issue remote commands.\n\n75\n00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.920\nI'm not a authenticating across it,\nbut I can still use it to check and\n\n76\n00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.725\nsee if a port is open and\nsee if a service is listening.\n\n77\n00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:06.195\nAnd things like that and\nI'm not transmitting sensitive data.\n\n78\n00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:07.525\nSo it has its place.\n\n79\n00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:10.605\nWe just have to understand where I\ncan use it, where I shouldn't use it,\n\n80\n00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:14.295\nand what alternatives I have if\nI'm not gonna use that, right?\n\n81\n00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:15.075\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n82\n00:04:15.075 --> 00:04:20.970\nThat's really the name of the game there\nis Is that you can use these technologies,\n\n83\n00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.290\nit's just a question of if you're\nusing it in an appropriate manner for\n\n84\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.510\npen testing, we use telenet all the time.\n\n85\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.490\nYou know, there are other alternatives\nto do that, I mean, some of\n\n86\n00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.930\nthe stuff that we do, or a good amount\nof the stuff that we do with telenet.\n\n87\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.170\nWe can do through things like Nmap,\nwe can do through Netcat, Cryptcat.\n\n88\n00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.370\nI mean just to name a few,\nyou can really add onto that.\n\n89\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.690\nBut telnet is very simple,\nthat's the thing.\n\n90\n00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.600\nI don't have to start up this whole\ntool and go through a bunch of boxes and\n\n91\n00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.990\neverything to make the thing work.\n\n92\n00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.680\nI can just pop an IP address in there and,\n\n93\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.340\na port number if it's required and\nthen boom, it'll go right to it and work.\n\n94\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.680\nSo that's why it's stuck around for\nso long, its simplicity.\n\n95\n00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.630\n>> I mean, as you said, some of these\ndevices might not support anything else\n\n96\n00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.790\nif that's the only way I have\nto connect to that, that router,\n\n97\n00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.750\nthat switch remotely that I\nmight be stuck with that.\n\n98\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.980\nOr as you say maybe get rid of\nthat router, or that switch, or\n\n99\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.680\nthat device,\nthat requires that older protocol.\n\n100\n00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.870\n>> Yeah, there's been a number of ways of\ndealing with this and the big concern with\n\n101\n00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.199\nTelnet is, is that there's nothing there\nin the way of security, it's just.\n\n102\n00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.870\n>> There's really no\nother way to put that.\n\n103\n00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.200\nThere's nothing there\nin the way of security.\n\n104\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.210\nIt asked you for a user name and password\nbut that doesn't really mean anything.\n\n105\n00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.970\nThat's a security blanket at best.\n\n106\n00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.520\nIt makes you feel like something,\n\n107\n00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.190\nlike you're somethings actually,\nhappening when it really isn't.\n\n108\n00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.820\nSo, that's just something that we\ntry to avoid whenever possible.\n\n109\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.570\nBut there's nothing\nwrong if it is used and\n\n110\n00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.230\nit's used with, you educate yourself and\n\n111\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.630\naware of limitations and\nthings that are gonna come along with it.\n\n112\n00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.540\nI would, for example, tell someone\ndon't use TelNet if you're coming from\n\n113\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.200\nthe outside and trying to login\nto a system on your own network.\n\n114\n00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.410\nThat would be a very poor choice.\n\n115\n00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.820\nUnless you use some sort\nof an encryption or\n\n116\n00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.720\nsomething on top of that but\nyou shouldn't be using Telnet for\n\n117\n00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.420\nsome sort of remote access strategy\ngoing over an insecure network.\n\n118\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.330\nHowever, if it's on the inside and\neverything's all inside your firewall\n\n119\n00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.230\nthat's being blocked so\nnothing can Telnet, concerning Telnet can\n\n120\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.350\ngo either way then you got a bit\nmore trust on your own network.\n\n121\n00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.660\nSo that acts as kind of an additional\nfactor in mitigating whether or\n\n122\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.210\nnot, a mitigating factor towards whether\nor not you're going to use this.\n\n123\n00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.030\nSo not something you need to\nnecessarily be scared of at all.\n\n124\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.320\nAnd yeah, David's right on this is that,\n\n125\n00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.830\nyeah this is one thing I was mentioning\nis that doesn't get installed.\n\n126\n00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:09.900\nTelnet hasn't been installed I believe\nit's at least since Windows Vista.\n\n127\n00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.600\nIt was there in XP.\n\n128\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.270\n>> Yeah I think it was\npre-installed there but a lot of\n\n129\n00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.130\n>> Yeah now a days you\n\n130\n00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.940\nhave to go into your [INAUDIBLE] and\nchoose to install it.\n\n131\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.730\n>> Yeah they've taken it and they've just\ntaken it out, you either have to check\n\n132\n00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.570\nthe box to install it or you can download\nif you really want from Microsoft.\n\n133\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.900\nSo it's there,\nthey haven't gotten rid of it,\n\n134\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.350\nthey've recognized the fact that people\nare gonna be using this and still need it.\n\n135\n00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.240\nBut they're trying to kinda say\nwell the people that need this,\n\n136\n00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.220\nwe'll let them go find it rather\nthan throw it in there and\n\n137\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.850\njust have it there potentially for\nexploitation or something else.\n\n138\n00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.230\nYou know, so that's something to\nreally kind of think about and\n\n139\n00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.490\nFTP would be in the same\nboat too by the way.\n\n140\n00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:58.411\nFTP is something that has been around for\nages just like telnet has.\n\n141\n00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:01.672\nAnd it's a very simple, does its job.\n\n142\n00:08:01.672 --> 00:08:06.860\nIt does it well and\nit still hangs around even to this day.\n\n143\n00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.834\nAnd it sticks around for all those things.\n\n144\n00:08:09.834 --> 00:08:14.458\nAnd it's simple, it's reliable,\nit's a known quantity but it's not secure.\n\n145\n00:08:14.458 --> 00:08:18.655\nIt's not something you should just be\nthrowing out there and saying yeah,\n\n146\n00:08:18.655 --> 00:08:19.630\nthis is great.\n\n147\n00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.240\nEven though people do,\nyou don't want to be one of those people.\n\n148\n00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.005\nThat's something that can work against you\npretty quickly especially when there's\n\n149\n00:08:27.005 --> 00:08:31.306\nreally good alternatives to this,\nyou don't need to use these things unless\n\n150\n00:08:31.306 --> 00:08:35.294\nyou're really just forced up against\nthe wall that you have to do that.\n\n151\n00:08:35.294 --> 00:08:38.719\n>> So what are some of our what\ncan we use in place of that thing?\n\n152\n00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:43.671\n>> SSH is a very common choice\nthat people use just because it's\n\n153\n00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:47.140\nsomething that's also very simple.\n\n154\n00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.850\nAnd it doesn't have a lot of over head and\nit's really available.\n\n155\n00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.780\nSo you can use it as a replacement.\n\n156\n00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.141\nI mean there's other one's you can use for\n\n157\n00:08:55.141 --> 00:08:58.644\nthe remote access stuff\nespecially on the tell net side.\n\n158\n00:08:58.644 --> 00:09:03.510\nI mean nowadays people are the system\nadmins that are coming\n\n159\n00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.000\nin over the last few years are used to\ngetting the whole remote desktop deal\n\n160\n00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.550\nexperience where they can\ngraphically see the whole desktop.\n\n161\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.180\nBut there's still enough usage\nof the command line stuff,\n\n162\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.190\nespecially when you get into pen testing,\na lot of it's command line.\n\n163\n00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.330\nSo once you get to that area,\n\n164\n00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.480\nyou're gonna start moving back\ntowards those other things.\n\n165\n00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.780\nBut SSH is something that can\nbe used to substitute for\n\n166\n00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.230\nTelnet and FTP.\n\n167\n00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:34.690\nAnd to kind of just to carry\non with that theme here,\n\n168\n00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:41.810\njust in case you haven't really ever seen\nwhat that looks like or why Telnet and\n\n169\n00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:47.540\nFTP just to take care of them both,\nwhy there's such a risk is,\n\n170\n00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.434\nwhat I've done on my system here,\nI've got on my desktop.\n\n171\n00:09:52.434 --> 00:09:55.366\nI've got an installation of Kali Linux and\n\n172\n00:09:55.366 --> 00:10:00.235\nthen I also have a metaexploitable\nrunning behind the scenes here.\n\n173\n00:10:00.235 --> 00:10:03.565\nSo just take my word for it,\nthat's running back there.\n\n174\n00:10:03.565 --> 00:10:06.925\nCuz we don't really need to look at that.\n\n175\n00:10:06.925 --> 00:10:09.485\nSo I can quite easily,\n\n176\n00:10:09.485 --> 00:10:14.740\njust, It just opened up a Telnet\nsession which I already have.\n\n177\n00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.920\nRight now I like that\nI've logged into Telnet.\n\n178\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.840\nIt's got a directory in\nthere called vulnerable.\n\n179\n00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.908\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n180\n00:10:19.908 --> 00:10:24.367\n>> Yeah really good sense of humor for\nthese guys but\n\n181\n00:10:24.367 --> 00:10:29.925\nyou can see that it keep rough and\ntype everything out again.\n\n182\n00:10:29.925 --> 00:10:35.153\nYou could see I've gone through and\npunch the different commands in,\n\n183\n00:10:35.153 --> 00:10:41.490\ngone through log in and it's given me\nthe information out saying it recognizes.\n\n184\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.000\nBasically recognizes,\nhe puts the banner and everything up so.\n\n185\n00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.770\nOkay that looks fine I also have nothing\n\n186\n00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:54.840\nreally to fancy there you can see that I\ntyped helmet and put the IP address in.\n\n187\n00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.890\nAsked me for a username and\n\n188\n00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.730\npassword then said okay welcome\naboard what do you want to do?\n\n189\n00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:04.020\nAnd I just did a simple LS to list quote\nwhat was in that location I logged into.\n\n190\n00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.380\nThen I have over on\nthis side I've got FTP,\n\n191\n00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.630\nwhere you can see my command prompt right\nhere, where it's in red, and it's got FTP\n\n192\n00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:18.810\nwith the IP address of the metasploitable\nserver sitting over there.\n\n193\n00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.960\n>> So again,\nI've given it the username and\n\n194\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.170\nthe password\n>> But\n\n195\n00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.270\nyou know which you know I didn't\nhave to do anything to hack it.\n\n196\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.160\nThis isn't the purpose of this.\n\n197\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.060\nI already know them from Metaspoitable,\nthey put it out there.\n\n198\n00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.220\nBut I've got that you know here as well.\n\n199\n00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.910\nNow so you've got these things here\nnow what's the security risk here.\n\n200\n00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.510\nWell that was all set in the clear.\n\n201\n00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.090\nThere's nothing being protected there.\n\n202\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:50.200\nEven though this is all within my own\nvirtual environment between the two so\n\n203\n00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.860\nnot much of a security risk there.\n\n204\n00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.330\nThe same would hold true if you did\nthis in any other environment without\n\n205\n00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:57.366\ndoing anything extra.\n\n206\n00:11:57.366 --> 00:12:00.840\nTelnet and FTP is still going\nto send stuff in the clear and\n\n207\n00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.270\nwhat I've done to kind of illustrate this\npoint is when I did this login in and\n\n208\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:10.180\nI'm just going to go through a bit\nof this is I had WireShark running.\n\n209\n00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:15.070\nI stopped it so\nit's not a live capture at this point.\n\n210\n00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:23.130\nBut what you can see down here\nis I did a packet capture.\n\n211\n00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.590\nYou can see it's got the Telnet\nprotocol listed right there and\n\n212\n00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:32.840\nhighlighted or in one case of highlights\nand look at that specific one but\n\n213\n00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.380\nit says here you can tell it's all\nsprinkled all throughout there you know so\n\n214\n00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.250\nI was just issuing a couple of commands.\n\n215\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:47.420\nI logged in a couple times you'll also\nsee there's some FTP stuff in there.\n\n216\n00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.650\nIt's mixed in there as well.\n\n217\n00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:56.200\nBut what's happened is all I have\nto do is I captured that traffic.\n\n218\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.190\nAnd since I saw Telnet in there.\n\n219\n00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.930\nIt's just screaming out at me.\n\n220\n00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:05.840\nI didn't have to do anything special for\nthat all I had to do it to once I captured\n\n221\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.340\nthat Telnet traffic and I know there's\nnothing special going on there.\n\n222\n00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.690\nAll I did was hit that little\nmagnifying glass up there and\n\n223\n00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.859\nsaid search into details for a packet.\n\n224\n00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:24.700\nAnd type a couple of things in and\njust kind of poke around.\n\n225\n00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.320\nAnd what do I get is actually\nhighlighted the packet for me.\n\n226\n00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:34.710\nAnd you can see in the actual I call it\nkind of the junk over there at the bottom.\n\n227\n00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:40.020\nYou can see it's got log in and\nall the stuff sitting there,\n\n228\n00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.260\noh, it says log in, the MSF admin\nsitting out there telling us,\n\n229\n00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.705\nthat's the user name and\npassword that was going across the wire.\n\n230\n00:13:47.705 --> 00:13:51.780\nSo any sniffer would do this.\n\n231\n00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.930\nLiterally any sniffer would be\nable to do this with Telnet.\n\n232\n00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.830\nAnd FTP or\nanything else that's going in the clear.\n\n233\n00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:06.220\nSo this is why you want\nto actually consider\n\n234\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.980\nnot using this and doing something like\nSSH or something like that because.\n\n235\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.270\nThis is just not gonna stay that way for\ntoo long.\n\n236\n00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:19.630\nSomeone's gonna penetrate this,\nand you can even see for FTP,\n\n237\n00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.670\nI didn't even have to dig\ninside the packet for this.\n\n238\n00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.250\nIt's got right here, FTP.\n\n239\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.840\nI was going through,\nI issued the command to attach FTP.\n\n240\n00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.930\nIt asks me for the user and\nthen I have a password sitting down here.\n\n241\n00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.800\nSo I mean that's as easy as it gets.\n\n242\n00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:43.870\nThis is a very insecure protocol but\nthen again, we don't want to sound like\n\n243\n00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.490\nwe're bashing on it just because when they\nbuilt this, that wasn't their concern.\n\n244\n00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.660\nThey weren't really thinking,\nhow can we make this thing airtight?\n\n245\n00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.800\nSo no one can do this\ntype of attack on it.\n\n246\n00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.050\nThey weren't thinking about that.\n\n247\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.160\nThey wanted something that could\naccess the system remotely and\n\n248\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.440\nrun stuff over there, and\n\n249\n00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.170\nthey wanted something that could transfer\nfiles back and forth across the wire.\n\n250\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.690\nIf you look at it in that context,\nboth of those programs have been very,\n\n251\n00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.120\nvery successful, but once we start mixing\nthe security issues we have nowadays\n\n252\n00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.900\nThe do not even address that one bit.\n\n253\n00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.940\nIt's not like, oh well, there's security\nthere because ask for user name and\n\n254\n00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:17.460\npassword.\n\n255\n00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.040\nYou can clearly see that that's\nnot really any security at all.\n\n256\n00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:26.590\nAll that's gonna do is it's gonna stop\nsomebody who is just a little curious.\n\n257\n00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.330\nThat's it.\n\n258\n00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:32.190\nIt's not gonna stop anybody with\neven a little bit of skill and\n\n259\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.670\nif you're doing pen testing and\nno sniffers and\n\n260\n00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:40.050\nnetwork protocols,\nthis is a no brainer for you.\n\n261\n00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.390\nYou can pull this very, very easily.\n\n262\n00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:46.919\nSo that's just to kind of illustrate you\nknow the remote, you know telnet and\n\n263\n00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:51.459\nFTP to kind of give you an idea of what\nstuff in the clear, how easy it is to get.\n\n264\n00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:56.289\nThis took me about a minute\nto set that demo up.\n\n265\n00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.871\nJust had to start the two virtual machines\nand telling that FTP, boom, captured it,\n\n266\n00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:01.833\nthere you go,\nthat's what you see on screen.\n\n267\n00:16:01.833 --> 00:16:05.045\n>> So, we gotta try to avoid in our\ndesign process, we want to think about\n\n268\n00:16:05.045 --> 00:16:08.978\nwhat protocols we're gonna be using for\nremote administration, or remote access.\n\n269\n00:16:08.978 --> 00:16:13.236\nAnd try to stay away from some of those\nplain text protocols, if we're worried\n\n270\n00:16:13.236 --> 00:16:17.680\nabout somebody running sniffers or\nbeing able to capture that traffic.\n\n271\n00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.080\n>> Yeah, it's absolutely a concern,\n\n272\n00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:27.350\nif you're gonna be running those\nprotocols, is think about, is it worth it?\n\n273\n00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.902\nLike we just said,\nTelnet is something that you can,\n\n274\n00:16:29.902 --> 00:16:31.570\nthat there are reasons to run it.\n\n275\n00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.730\nThere's perfectly valid reasons.\n\n276\n00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:38.400\nI'd be way, way out of line to say,\n\n277\n00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.730\nhey you should not be using Telnet and if\nyou do you're stupid, and all that stuff.\n\n278\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:42.760\nI'd be really,\n\n279\n00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:48.730\npushing it there because there's plenty\nof reasons why you would still run that.\n\n280\n00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:53.035\nBut anybody that's running it should be\nwell aware of the type of issues you just\n\n281\n00:16:53.035 --> 00:16:56.827\nsaw here and has made the decision for\nthemselves, I still need that or\n\n282\n00:16:56.827 --> 00:17:01.220\nI can't get rid of it because I just can't\nreplace the technology that needs it.\n\n283\n00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.200\n>> And then along those same lines\nwe look at things like SSL right?\n\n284\n00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.730\nAnd then we gotta look at its\ncounterparty CTP, which is plain text so,\n\n285\n00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.590\nkind of the same concept going on there,\nright?\n\n286\n00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:14.530\n>> Yeah,\nit would be exactly the same thing.\n\n287\n00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:21.760\nWhat I did for FTP and Telnet could be\ndone just as easily for HTTP requests.\n\n288\n00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.770\nIf someone's transmitting\nanything sensitive over that,\n\n289\n00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:26.970\nit can easily be captured.\n\n290\n00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:32.200\nIf it's not encrypted, I can capture it,\nreassemble it, and see what's going on.\n\n291\n00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.110\nSo that makes it a very,\nvery big concern of yours.\n\n292\n00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.430\nBut then again, I mean,\nmost though, in the case of HTTP,\n\n293\n00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.850\nif you're just going up to\nsomething like USA Today, or\n\n294\n00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:48.500\nsomething like that, just a news\nwebsite or something like that.\n\n295\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.060\nProbably not that big of a deal to\neven worry about encrypting this.\n\n296\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.860\nIt's when you want to log into\nsomething or go to a restricted area or\n\n297\n00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.200\nsomething of a website, or\n\n298\n00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.650\nweb application as the case may be, that's\nwhere you need to bring that to bear.\n\n299\n00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:05.445\nAnd you need to, when you're thinking\nabout setting this stuff up is are,\n\n300\n00:18:05.445 --> 00:18:10.325\ndo you have areas like that, that you\nneed to have that level of protection on?\n\n301\n00:18:10.325 --> 00:18:12.775\nAnd think of how you implement it.\n\n302\n00:18:14.275 --> 00:18:18.402\nThink of how strong it needs to be,\ngoing back to our encryption stuff.\n\n303\n00:18:18.402 --> 00:18:22.496\nAnd there is people that implement all\nsort of password protective stuff on web\n\n304\n00:18:22.496 --> 00:18:26.650\nservers and done some stuff that you\nreally kinda just scratch your head going,\n\n305\n00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.340\ndid you really do that that way?\n\n306\n00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:35.331\nCuz that was just a dumb way\nto implement those things.\n\n307\n00:18:35.331 --> 00:18:39.298\nOne of the things I did during\nthe ethical hacking class or\n\n308\n00:18:39.298 --> 00:18:43.431\ncourse is I went through and\nshowed you how to get into that,\n\n309\n00:18:43.431 --> 00:18:50.160\nlook that software through Google, called\nBig Brother, that system monitoring.\n\n310\n00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.016\nI kid you not, I've seen one on\nthere that pops up now and then and\n\n311\n00:18:54.016 --> 00:18:56.457\nthey're not the only ones that do this.\n\n312\n00:18:56.457 --> 00:18:59.110\nThat you go to the page.\n\n313\n00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:03.050\nSo, you click on the link and go to the\npage and you see all the fields populated,\n\n314\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.480\nstatus information populated, all that.\n\n315\n00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.130\nAnd after all that's populated,\nit brings up a login dialogue box saying,\n\n316\n00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.230\ngive me your user name and password.\n\n317\n00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:13.430\nLike, isn't that a little late?\n\n318\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.490\nYou know I just dragged that out of\nthe way and look at what's back there.\n\n319\n00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.460\nOr if I don't even want to do\nthat I just hit Cancel, and\n\n320\n00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.010\nit says, okay I'll get you later.\n\n321\n00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.380\nYou click on another link it'll pop up,\n\n322\n00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.370\nyou hit Cancel again\nyou keep viewing that.\n\n323\n00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.450\nIt's does nothing.\n\n324\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:31.490\nSomeone put it there because it's gonna\nstop the person that's a casual attacker.\n\n325\n00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.050\nOoh, I shouldn't be here,\nthere's a user name and password.\n\n326\n00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.804\nIt's asking me to log in,\nI'm gonna get in trouble.\n\n327\n00:19:36.804 --> 00:19:37.617\nNo, you're not.\n\n328\n00:19:37.617 --> 00:19:39.718\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're just not.\n\n329\n00:19:39.718 --> 00:19:44.157\nIt was implemented poorly, very very\npoorly, to put something like that\n\n330\n00:19:44.157 --> 00:19:48.240\nin place because it's doing nothing for\nyou security wise.\n\n331\n00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.750\nAnd to kind of also factor\ninto this with the SSL and\n\n332\n00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:58.070\nall of that, is if you look at those\nbig brother sites that are out there,\n\n333\n00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.860\none of the things I said during\nthe ethical hacking course is\n\n334\n00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.000\npeople wanna be able to view those\nstats and stuff like that remotely.\n\n335\n00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.510\nAnd I can totally understand that\nas a network admin wanting to view\n\n336\n00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.350\nthat stuff remotely.\n\n337\n00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.010\nBut even knowing that there's no reason\nI should be able to view your stuff\n\n338\n00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.490\nremotely, unless you've\ncleared me to do that.\n\n339\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.780\nIf I don't have an account there,\nI should not be able to view it.\n\n340\n00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.725\nIf I have no reason to be viewing it,\nI should not be viewing it.\n\n341\n00:20:21.725 --> 00:20:26.657\nAnd you saw we did a few\nquick Google hacks.\n\n342\n00:20:26.657 --> 00:20:30.380\nIt didn't take that long and\nthe stuff was right there on my screen.\n\n343\n00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:36.620\nI was just browsing around, taking my\ntime and seeing what I could find.\n\n344\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.290\nIt wasn't that big of an effort.\n\n345\n00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.610\nIt should never ever be like that.\n\n346\n00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:45.602\nIt should be that you go to that site and\nyou have HTTP access and\n\n347\n00:20:45.602 --> 00:20:51.842\nwhen you go to a section of the site, if\nthis is the way you want to set it up, and\n\n348\n00:20:51.842 --> 00:20:57.026\nwhere the Big Brother stuff is,\nthat should be a login portal and\n\n349\n00:20:57.026 --> 00:21:00.117\nthen that goes to SSL or HTTP over SSL.\n\n350\n00:21:00.117 --> 00:21:01.372\nSo HTTPS.\n\n351\n00:21:01.372 --> 00:21:04.911\nYou log in and then everything\nbehind that stays encrypted and\n\n352\n00:21:04.911 --> 00:21:08.190\nprotected when it's being\ntransmitted back and forth.\n\n353\n00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.880\nSo I can't monkey around to get in there.\n\n354\n00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.718\nAnd so that's another design thing,\nis that you wouldn't want\n\n355\n00:21:14.718 --> 00:21:19.066\nto put just the user and password thing\nin and say okay, I got your stuff.\n\n356\n00:21:19.066 --> 00:21:23.489\nAnd you'd also want to make sure that the\nlogin page that you provided is just not\n\n357\n00:21:23.489 --> 00:21:26.740\nSSL there, and\nthen everything is behind is in the clear.\n\n358\n00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.540\nThis is nothing if you do it that way.\n\n359\n00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.020\nThat's a speed bump,\nthat's what we call that.\n\n360\n00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.990\nThat's gonna make me slow down and\ngo why'd you do that?\n\n361\n00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:36.720\nAnd I'm still gonna get into your\nstuff if you haven't put SSL on it.\n\n362\n00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.490\nSo you wanna have everything behind\nthat wall done that way, and\n\n363\n00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:42.830\nthat would be perfectly acceptable.\n\n364\n00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.480\nIt's using the technology\nthe way it should be.\n\n365\n00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.820\nWe have so many things we already\nlooked at for our other explorations.\n\n366\n00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.490\nI can do HTTP, Wireshark is one of them.\n\n367\n00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.352\n>> Yeah.\n\n368\n00:21:53.352 --> 00:21:56.880\nAll right, and then we've got our VPN\naccess, which is definitely a concern.\n\n369\n00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.970\nIt's gonna be part of our design.\n\n370\n00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:03.200\nRemote access is almost ubiquitous now\nin our networks, well I would say.\n\n371\n00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.750\n>> Yeah, I mean how many networks have you\nheard of that don't have remote access?\n\n372\n00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.890\n>> At a minimum for administration, and\nthen a good portion for user access,\n\n373\n00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.230\nso they can work when they're\neither travelling or at home.\n\n374\n00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:20.796\n>> Yeah, when I've run into people and\nI've asked,\n\n375\n00:22:20.796 --> 00:22:27.797\ndo you have a VPN, or do you have\nany server remote access setup?\n\n376\n00:22:27.797 --> 00:22:30.590\nAnd this is not when\nI'm doing pen testing,\n\n377\n00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:34.350\nthis is like somebody that trusts me or\nwe know each other.\n\n378\n00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:38.357\nI've heard a lot where they say,\nno we don't have any remote access.\n\n379\n00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:41.690\nReally, in this day and age,\nyou don't have any remote access?\n\n380\n00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:44.429\nWhat's really happening here is you\ndon't know you have given them rights.\n\n381\n00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:46.910\nThey haven't shared that\ninformation with you.\n\n382\n00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:51.340\nThat's more likely the case,\nthat's not me being a wise guy about it.\n\n383\n00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.810\nIt's just not something\nthat happens that often.\n\n384\n00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:58.942\nIt does happen but it's not something that\nyou're gonna run into all that often.\n\n385\n00:22:58.942 --> 00:23:02.123\n>> And we're setting up remote access,\nit's like yeah, we're picking the right\n\n386\n00:23:02.123 --> 00:23:04.850\nprotocol, right, making sure that\nwe're setting it up securely.\n\n387\n00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.770\nBecause there are certain protocols we\ncan use that don't secure the traffic.\n\n388\n00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.470\nThere are protocols we can use\nthat do secure the traffic.\n\n389\n00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:16.230\nThere's protocols that rely on the ITD6\nlikethe direct access in Microsoft world,\n\n390\n00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.020\nso there are ways to secure it,\nwe just got to be aware and\n\n391\n00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.990\nmake sure we design it properly.\n\n392\n00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.470\n>> Yeah, you gotta use the right tools for\nthe job.\n\n393\n00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.350\nKnow their limitations.\n\n394\n00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.570\nKnow their strengths, weaknesses,\n\n395\n00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.310\nthat type of stuff and\nuse them the correct way.\n\n396\n00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.205\nJust like the SSL stuff I just mentioned,\n\n397\n00:23:33.205 --> 00:23:37.479\nI just went through this whole thing\nabout saying about using a password.\n\n398\n00:23:37.479 --> 00:23:40.251\nWell, you could very easily just tell me,\n\n399\n00:23:40.251 --> 00:23:46.290\nif you didn't put too much thought into\nit, say, well I'll just use SSL on that.\n\n400\n00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.743\nThat serves no purpose.\n\n401\n00:23:47.743 --> 00:23:52.237\nIt has to be everything from that login\npage and after that, to trying to access\n\n402\n00:23:52.237 --> 00:23:56.751\nthat needs to go over SSL to make sure\nthat it doesn't get into the wrong hands.\n\n403\n00:23:56.751 --> 00:23:58.586\nSo that's a design thing.\n\n404\n00:23:58.586 --> 00:24:02.649\nIt needs to be thought about,\nit needs to be thought out, about.\n\n405\n00:24:02.649 --> 00:24:07.475\nWhen you get to this level, and you start\ntalking about this advanced network\n\n406\n00:24:07.475 --> 00:24:12.524\ndesign, we do expect you to know and\nhave some understanding of the technology,\n\n407\n00:24:12.524 --> 00:24:17.280\nbut as far as actual implementation,\nyou may not ever get into that.\n\n408\n00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.520\nYou need to know where\nthese things come in or\n\n409\n00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.120\nwhere to get the expertise to understand\nwhat the proper design would look like.\n\n410\n00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.280\nFor the big brother stuff,\nif you're not a web person,\n\n411\n00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.440\na web developer or any type of that\nnonsense, there's nothing wrong with that,\n\n412\n00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.480\nthere's people who know how to\ndo that who are good at it.\n\n413\n00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.560\nIf you're not,\nenlist those people to do that and\n\n414\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.590\ntell them this is what I'm trying to do.\n\n415\n00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.420\nDo you see anything weird on this or\n\n416\n00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.780\nanything that would enhance\nthe security of it?\n\n417\n00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.510\nWork together that way.\n\n418\n00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.440\nThat's what the name of the game is.\n\n419\n00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.810\nSomeone wants you to come up with a good\ndesign and how you want things to look,\n\n420\n00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:59.640\nlet someone worry about the actual\ndetails of implementation.\n\n421\n00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.730\n>> And then probably the same kind of\nconcepts when it comes to authentication\n\n422\n00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.710\nand picking an authentication method for\nwhatever it is.\n\n423\n00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:06.690\n>> Yeah, authentication,\n\n424\n00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:11.510\nthere's literally a bunch of\ndifferent methods of authenticating.\n\n425\n00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.970\nThe ones they tend to hit for\n\n426\n00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:18.300\nhere for CompTIA are the usual\nsuspects as I like to say.\n\n427\n00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:26.510\nThere are things like PAP, then you've\ngot CHAP, MS CHAP and all those ones.\n\n428\n00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.880\nBut they hit on all those ones, and\n\n429\n00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.210\nyou get things like Kerberos and\nstuff like that.\n\n430\n00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.900\nIt's probably nothing that you haven't\nrun into, especially with Kerberos.\n\n431\n00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.756\nYou probably, the chances are the network\nyou work on is active directory base, so\n\n432\n00:25:41.756 --> 00:25:45.920\nyou've run the kerberos there even if you\nhaven't directly had to deal with it and\n\n433\n00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.570\nMicrosoft takes that away from you.\n\n434\n00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.140\nSo it's working behind the scenes.\n\n435\n00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.390\nIt just works and\nyou go about what you need to.\n\n436\n00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:58.050\nThe other stuff, the other things\nlike patch app and all that stuff,\n\n437\n00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:03.910\nthose ones are ones that are really kinda\nset up primarily for remote access.\n\n438\n00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:09.060\nAnd those ones using, it's pretty\neasy to make the right decision\n\n439\n00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.390\non that when you think about\nit because you have PAP and\n\n440\n00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.240\nyou even have SPAP if you\nwanna to get down to.\n\n441\n00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.870\nTo those details, those ones,\nwhen you look at the details on them,\n\n442\n00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.270\nthere's no security on those two.\n\n443\n00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:25.640\nSo you should get rid of those, unless\nyou can really justify it, the risks\n\n444\n00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:32.070\nyou have there, ditch it, and then go\nwith CHAP or something up from there.\n\n445\n00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:36.010\nDo not go down to the older ones and\njust leave those be.\n\n446\n00:26:37.272 --> 00:26:39.850\n>> All right well a lot of good\ninformation there about remote access and\n\n447\n00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:43.880\nsome of the different choices we have to\nmake when designing a secure solution\n\n448\n00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.550\nto provide that level of access\nto our corporate environment.\n\n449\n00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:50.890\nSo anything else we need to talk about\nbefore we wrap this one up Shawn?\n\n450\n00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:54.440\n>> No, I think we kind of got,\nI hope we got the point across.\n\n451\n00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.040\nI hope, actually, that little, quick,\nI mean it wasn't a fancy demo there.\n\n452\n00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.740\nI wasn't trying to make it\nreally flashy or anything.\n\n453\n00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:04.720\nI just wanted to show you,\nspecifically, what that looks like.\n\n454\n00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.380\nProbably, a lot of you will have heard\nthat satoma net TP are vulnerable.\n\n455\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:08.980\nThere you go.\n\n456\n00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.890\nThat was a very quick and\ndirty no frills demo there you go and\n\n457\n00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:18.620\nso now you now you've seen it so you\nshould never again go is that vulnerable?\n\n458\n00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.280\nYes, the answer is yes it is.\n\n459\n00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.605\n>> Very good Well that's going to do it\nfor this episode ladies and gentlemen, so\n\n460\n00:27:25.605 --> 00:27:28.075\nsigning off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Broderick.\n\n461\n00:27:28.075 --> 00:27:28.975\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n462\n00:27:28.975 -->

00:00:15.540\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.068\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:17.657\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:17.657 --> 00:00:19.860\n>> Doing fantastic, excited to be here.\n\n7\n00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.370\nWe've got another episode\ncoming your way in our\n\n8\n00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.280\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner\nseries.\n\n9\n00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.670\nAnd in this one we're gonna be\nlooking at something known as SCADA or\n\n10\n00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.445\nSupervisory Control And Data Acquisition.\n\n11\n00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:37.140\nSean, what the heck is that and\nhow does that fit into my network design?\n\n12\n00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.671\n>> This is one of those\nthings that you know you and\n\n13\n00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:43.144\nI had talked about on the break.\n\n14\n00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:46.169\nIt's one of these things that,\n\n15\n00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:51.108\nit's actually good that\nCompTIA is bringing it up.\n\n16\n00:00:51.108 --> 00:00:54.197\nBut it's also one of those things that\njust doesn't fit any other place.\n\n17\n00:00:54.197 --> 00:01:01.093\nAnd quite frankly most of you, maybe all\nof you, will never really run into it.\n\n18\n00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:06.642\nBut even with that being said, it is\nsomething that you should be aware of.\n\n19\n00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:10.670\nIt's something that you may work on.\n\n20\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.970\nThere's nothing saying you don't,\n\n21\n00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.828\nit's just something that's\npretty unique in where it is.\n\n22\n00:01:14.828 --> 00:01:19.140\nBut what SCADA systems are,\nthey're things that are used,\n\n23\n00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.040\ntypically you'll see them in things\nlike power plants, you'll see them.\n\n24\n00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.470\nAnd we talk power plants, we're talking\neverything from electrical grids to\n\n25\n00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.800\nhydroelectric power to\neven nuclear reactors and\n\n26\n00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.980\nstuff like that they show up in.\n\n27\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.370\nThey will show up in manufacturing.\n\n28\n00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.561\nSo they are kind of very\nspecific in where they show up.\n\n29\n00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:42.909\nSo if you work in something like\npower generation or utilities,\n\n30\n00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.270\nthen they're there.\n\n31\n00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.180\nYou already have run into\nthem in some way, shape, or\n\n32\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.760\nform if you're in the IT area.\n\n33\n00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.527\nOnce you get outside of that,\n\n34\n00:01:53.527 --> 00:01:58.414\nthe chance of you running into them really\nkind of decreases quite dramatically.\n\n35\n00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:02.769\nBut it is enough of an issue with these\nsystems, and security issues with them\n\n36\n00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:07.470\nare enough of an issue, that they\nreally do need to be talked about.\n\n37\n00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.190\nThis is probably, to be quite honest with\nall the viewers, everything out there.\n\n38\n00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.020\nThis is one of those things that you're\ngonna really feel kind of unsafe,\n\n39\n00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.840\non some of the stuff after you hear\nwhat's done with these systems.\n\n40\n00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.800\nI can almost guarantee it.\n\n41\n00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.250\nI've seen people go through fits and stuff\nlike this going, that can really be done?\n\n42\n00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.420\nYeah, some of this stuff really\ncan be done and has been done.\n\n43\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.630\n>> It is kind of scary, Sean,\n\n44\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.100\nwhen we're looking at some of the\nvulnerabilities that we face with this.\n\n45\n00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.430\nCuz you see it, as you said,\nin some really important places.\n\n46\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.380\nAs far as like all of our utilities and\npower companies, and\n\n47\n00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.840\nmanufacturing processes.\n\n48\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.240\nHeck, I know they even talk about\nit in like our airports, and ships,\n\n49\n00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.785\nand space stations.\n\n50\n00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:51.827\nAnd it's any kind of system where\nwe've got to automate control over\n\n51\n00:02:51.827 --> 00:02:52.777\nmachinery, right.\n\n52\n00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:56.782\nWhere I can pull up data on\nthe status of a liquid level, or\n\n53\n00:02:56.782 --> 00:02:59.882\na flow through a pipe or\nanything like that.\n\n54\n00:02:59.882 --> 00:03:03.889\nAnd then have controls sent out,\nand adjust those speeds, or\n\n55\n00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.753\nrates of pumping, or\nlevels in a tank and things like that.\n\n56\n00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:12.650\nSo, if I can get in and mess with that,\nwe could really do some damage.\n\n57\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.372\n>> Yeah, and that's the thing is,\nconsider what Mike just said, and\n\n58\n00:03:17.372 --> 00:03:18.640\nthink about what I just said, too.\n\n59\n00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.730\nThe industries that they're in,\nand you're talking about stuff\n\n60\n00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.220\nthat could be manufacturing,\nbut it's also power generation.\n\n61\n00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.209\nAnd I was talking about electrical and\nnuclear power.\n\n62\n00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.095\nI mean, that would be something\nthat is quite frightening for\n\n63\n00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:38.320\nthat to be compromised in some way,\nshape or form.\n\n64\n00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.764\nThese things, these SCADA systems,\n\n65\n00:03:41.764 --> 00:03:46.080\nare present in all of those areas,\nworldwide.\n\n66\n00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.410\nIt's not something that's\nrestricted here to the US.\n\n67\n00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.660\nAnd, traditionally, these SCADA systems,\nwhy they are good at what they do.\n\n68\n00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.640\nThe thing is is that security has been,\n\n69\n00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.120\nI'm not even gonna say\nsecurity's been an afterthought.\n\n70\n00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.211\nThat assumes that someone's\nreally thought about it.\n\n71\n00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.838\nIf I say it's an afterthought, at least\nyou thought about it after the fact.\n\n72\n00:04:07.838 --> 00:04:09.670\nIt's like no,\n\n73\n00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.010\nsomeone didn't even take it out of\nthe box when they got the new stuff.\n\n74\n00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.480\nIt's still sitting back there waiting for\nsomeone to say hey,\n\n75\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.410\nyou left a piece sitting here.\n\n76\n00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.820\nSo it's quite terrifying when you see the\ntypes of stuff that has been done with it,\n\n77\n00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.820\nand the things that can be done with it.\n\n78\n00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.510\n>> And in fairness,\n\n79\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.080\nI think a lot of it was designed with\nthe thought that it's all internal, right?\n\n80\n00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.080\nIt's within this manufacturing facility,\nor this water treatment plant, or\n\n81\n00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.720\nthis power generation plant.\n\n82\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.820\nAnd a software that was used\ninternally to control these devices and\n\n83\n00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.360\nthings like that, and maybe that was okay.\n\n84\n00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.900\nWhen you had good, physical security and\ncouldn't get access to that network.\n\n85\n00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.130\nBut now everything's networked together.\n\n86\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.500\nWe've got all these new techniques for\n\n87\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.020\nintroducing malware, like we talked\nabout in some of our other episodes.\n\n88\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.180\nAnd so all of a sudden,\nthis becomes very vulnerable, and\n\n89\n00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.750\nwith no security in the initial design,\nit is frightening.\n\n90\n00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.940\n>> Yeah, it was not specced\nout to really consider that.\n\n91\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.108\nAnd you hit not the nail on the head, but\n\n92\n00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:14.102\none of the nails on the head,\nby making that statement there,\n\n93\n00:05:14.102 --> 00:05:18.444\nis that the way these things\nare networked together.\n\n94\n00:05:18.444 --> 00:05:20.580\nI mean, they're networking more and\nmore systems together.\n\n95\n00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.864\nOne of the thoughts behind SCADA to keep\nit safe was they air gapped them, so\n\n96\n00:05:24.864 --> 00:05:28.220\nthere was that, and\nthen there was everything else.\n\n97\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.290\nAnd those two didn't touch.\n\n98\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.210\nThat's doesn't stay that way.\n\n99\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.560\nIt really doesn't.\n\n100\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.252\nIf you have any chance at\nall of staying that way,\n\n101\n00:05:37.252 --> 00:05:42.944\nyou have to have a security program\nthat's empowered to just go out there.\n\n102\n00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:47.438\nAnd maybe even literally go out with\na pair of scissors and cut the cord\n\n103\n00:05:47.438 --> 00:05:52.185\nbetween the two, if someone happens\nto drag it between the two systems.\n\n104\n00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:58.408\nCuz once that door's open, it's easy\nenough for something to move across that.\n\n105\n00:05:58.408 --> 00:06:00.816\nAnd even if they're air gapped,\n\n106\n00:06:00.816 --> 00:06:06.837\nyou've got another nagging problem as part\nof this equation called human beings.\n\n107\n00:06:06.837 --> 00:06:11.341\nThat will also go through and mess\nthe whole thing up if it comes down to it.\n\n108\n00:06:11.341 --> 00:06:14.035\n>> It's our nature,\nwe like to fill those gaps, don't we.\n\n109\n00:06:14.035 --> 00:06:18.947\n>> Yeah, they will definitely fill those\ngaps with a whole bunch of problems headed\n\n110\n00:06:18.947 --> 00:06:19.607\nyour way.\n\n111\n00:06:19.607 --> 00:06:27.153\nSo, you really have to factor those two\nthings and plus a bunch of other stuff.\n\n112\n00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:32.121\nI mean like you said, they depend\non security by how you air gap,\n\n113\n00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:34.792\nand control access to the system.\n\n114\n00:06:34.792 --> 00:06:38.416\nThey're not really relying on too\nmuch in the way of technology and\n\n115\n00:06:38.416 --> 00:06:41.070\nsafeguards built into\nthe system to protect it,\n\n116\n00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.100\nlike we would have with our\nnormal networking stuff.\n\n117\n00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.575\nSo that's a huge concern.\n\n118\n00:06:46.575 --> 00:06:50.519\nAnd just to kind of give an example here,\n\n119\n00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:55.634\nof a situation where SCADA\nsystems were exploited.\n\n120\n00:06:55.634 --> 00:07:00.371\nEven though they were designed and\nair gapped, the human element came in.\n\n121\n00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:04.783\nAll we have to do is point\nfrom a couple of years ago.\n\n122\n00:07:04.783 --> 00:07:08.498\nWell more than a couple years ago now,\njust point towards Stuxnet.\n\n123\n00:07:08.498 --> 00:07:16.896\nStuxnet was directly taking advantage\nof the weaknesses in SCADA systems.\n\n124\n00:07:16.896 --> 00:07:21.870\nWhen Stuxnet appeared in the Iranian\n\n125\n00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.340\nnuclear enrichment systems or plutonium,\nuranium or something like that.\n\n126\n00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.490\nWhen they appeared in those systems,\n\n127\n00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:34.500\nwhat happened was that they had the\nsystems that controlled the centrifuges.\n\n128\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.400\nAnd then they had all the other stuff and\nthere was an air gap between those.\n\n129\n00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.450\nWell somehow it hopped and\nyou don't just have it.\n\n130\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.647\nThere's no virus or worm or anything like\nthat smart enough to just jump through\n\n131\n00:07:45.647 --> 00:07:47.545\nthe air as a bunch of\nbits onto another system.\n\n132\n00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:48.659\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> It has to move,\n\n133\n00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:51.122\nhave some way of getting\nfrom one to the other.\n\n134\n00:07:51.122 --> 00:07:52.656\nIn the case of Stuxnet,\n\n135\n00:07:52.656 --> 00:07:57.194\nit's very obvious that some piece\nof media was moved between the two.\n\n136\n00:07:57.194 --> 00:08:03.170\nOr directly plugged into this air\ngapped network and started to spread.\n\n137\n00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:09.295\nAnd because the SCADA systems collectively\nwas monitoring these centrifuges,\n\n138\n00:08:09.295 --> 00:08:12.786\nStuxnet was able to\ntake advantage of that.\n\n139\n00:08:12.786 --> 00:08:15.210\nAnd so Stuxnet got in there and\n\n140\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:20.120\nwas able to do things like\ngot into the systems and was\n\n141\n00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.915\nable to record the speed these centrifuges\nwere supposed to be turning at.\n\n142\n00:08:23.915 --> 00:08:27.500\nAnd was actually feeding this information\nback to the monitoring system.\n\n143\n00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.670\nWhile behind the scenes,\nit was subtly varying, speeding up and\n\n144\n00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:36.170\nslowing down the centrifuges just\nenough to cause them to crack and fail.\n\n145\n00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:40.980\nSo the fact of the matter is that\nit's taking a snapshot of the data,\n\n146\n00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.690\nfeeding that back into\nthe monitoring systems.\n\n147\n00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.500\nAnd then behind the scenes,\n\n148\n00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.340\nit's doing this stuff,\nwhere it's causing systems to fail.\n\n149\n00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:52.270\nAnd you don't break a centrifuge for that\ntype of stuff, just by doing random stuff.\n\n150\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.520\nI mean that will eventually\ncause it to fail.\n\n151\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.180\nBut there was some\nintelligence behind that too.\n\n152\n00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:04.825\nSo now you have a situation where you've\ngot a nuclear processing facility.\n\n153\n00:09:04.825 --> 00:09:09.895\nAnd then you've got, someone had\nknowledge of those systems behind it,\n\n154\n00:09:09.895 --> 00:09:13.509\nwas able to get something on there and\ncause mayhem.\n\n155\n00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:17.028\nI mean, they only had centrifuges fail.\n\n156\n00:09:17.028 --> 00:09:21.590\nI mean, think if that was in a full blown\nnuclear reactor, something like that.\n\n157\n00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.120\nAnd those systems\nare indeed present there.\n\n158\n00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.580\nSo, there's a big issue,\nhere in the United States,\n\n159\n00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.627\nthe nuclear reactors that we have here.\n\n160\n00:09:34.627 --> 00:09:37.220\nThey haven't really commissioned any and\nas I recall,\n\n161\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.100\nhaven't really commissioned\nany in like 30 or 40 years?\n\n162\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.210\n>> Yeah it's been a little while.\n\n163\n00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.800\n>> It's been a long time.\n\n164\n00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.684\nSo, you got to think that the systems that\nare in there are not systems that have\n\n165\n00:09:47.684 --> 00:09:49.694\nbeen really upgraded too much.\n\n166\n00:09:49.694 --> 00:09:51.839\nBecause they can't just go into\na nuclear reactor and go, okay,\n\n167\n00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:52.619\nshut the reactor down.\n\n168\n00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:55.320\nWe're going to rip all this stuff out and\nput in a bunch of flat screens.\n\n169\n00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.533\nThey're not gonna do that,\nbecause those systems were purpose built,\n\n170\n00:09:58.533 --> 00:09:59.330\nuniquely built.\n\n171\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.680\nThey can upgrade some of it,\nbut not all of it.\n\n172\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.890\nSo, you've got a big\narea of concern there.\n\n173\n00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.970\nAnd so you could actually conceivably,\n\n174\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.805\njust to kind of really add\nsomething else to this.\n\n175\n00:10:11.805 --> 00:10:16.590\nStuxnet is something that could\nvery easily be deployed against\n\n176\n00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.300\nour reactors and stuff like that here.\n\n177\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.890\nIt's the exact same systems, so.\n\n178\n00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.810\n>> It's incredibly scary to think about.\n\n179\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.837\nWe read about these data breaches and\nthings like that.\n\n180\n00:10:25.837 --> 00:10:28.719\nAnd it's a horrible thing\nwhen large number of people,\n\n181\n00:10:28.719 --> 00:10:33.030\ntheir personal information is let out,\ncredit card information is let out.\n\n182\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.410\nThat's a horrible, horrible thing.\n\n183\n00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:39.120\nBut to think this kind of breach could\ncause a nuclear reactor to melt down,\n\n184\n00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.890\nbecause they've shut off a cooling valve,\nor something simple like that,\n\n185\n00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.770\nis really scary.\n\n186\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:47.980\nI can't say it any other way.\n\n187\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.650\nAnother thing I have been reading about\nwith SCADA is the EMP as another type\n\n188\n00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:57.540\nof attack that they can throw against\nthese systems that they are vulnerable to.\n\n189\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.500\n>> Yeah, they really did not think of\nsecurity as part of this equation.\n\n190\n00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.280\nIt was something that they're\nonly now realizing that,\n\n191\n00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.540\nwe better really do something about it.\n\n192\n00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:13.650\nSome of these monitoring things that\nfit into the SCADA framework and\n\n193\n00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.660\nare approved for that.\n\n194\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.840\nOne of the main manufacturers of\nthem is Siemens over in Germany.\n\n195\n00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:25.580\nThey make these things and\none of the control units that they have\n\n196\n00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.980\nthat's extremely popular\nis all over the world.\n\n197\n00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.610\nIt's not something that's\nrestricted just to a few areas.\n\n198\n00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:34.890\nIt's all over the world, so\n\n199\n00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.885\nthat vulnerability exists in\nsystems all over the place.\n\n200\n00:11:37.885 --> 00:11:42.352\nSo that's just talking about\nthe nuclear side of things,\n\n201\n00:11:42.352 --> 00:11:45.580\nwhat about the electrical grid?\n\n202\n00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:50.280\nThey've already had attacks against\nthe electrical grid that was taken\n\n203\n00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.240\nadvantage of the big gaps that\nwe have in the SCADA system.\n\n204\n00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.770\nThey just didn't account for that, so\n\n205\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:02.622\nsomeone was able to get some attacks and\ncause problems there.\n\n206\n00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:08.130\nAnd undoubtedly there is more stuff on the\nhorizon that is just waiting to emerge,\n\n207\n00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.170\nor has emerged,\nwe just don't know about it.\n\n208\n00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.600\nIf you think about some of these systems,\n\n209\n00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.690\nI think about stuff like\nif you had let's just say.\n\n210\n00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.130\nHope it doesn't happen,\n\n211\n00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:25.490\nlet's just say someone was able to\nget something into a nuclear reactor.\n\n212\n00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:29.259\nIf you're able to, that's a delicate\nbalance they have in those things.\n\n213\n00:12:29.259 --> 00:12:34.763\nSo if those things are manipulated enough\nover enough of a period of time, or\n\n214\n00:12:34.763 --> 00:12:40.440\neven a short period of time, manipulated\nenough, you could have a meltdown.\n\n215\n00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.791\nIt happens in the right place,\n\n216\n00:12:41.791 --> 00:12:47.320\nyou're gonna have a massive\narea of destruction there.\n\n217\n00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.978\nI think of some place like in\nsouthern California, they've got,\n\n218\n00:12:51.978 --> 00:12:56.480\nI think it's San Clemente,\nit's down near the San Diego area.\n\n219\n00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.470\nIf someone was able to go through and\ntarget that, and\n\n220\n00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:06.970\ncause a meltdown, and\ncause all the radiation all to be spread.\n\n221\n00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.760\nNot only do they have the radiation\ngoing all over the place,\n\n222\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.580\nthey also got major freeways there.\n\n223\n00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:17.670\nSo, the major artery that moves stuff\nback and forth between San Diego,\n\n224\n00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:23.060\nOceanside, and LA and all that, that's\njust been cut off right at the knees.\n\n225\n00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.040\nSo emergency equipment's not\ngonna get through there and\n\n226\n00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.980\nthen you've got just a lot of\npeople living in that area.\n\n227\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.720\nSo, they can't get out of the area\nthey have to sit there and\n\n228\n00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.980\njust basically, take it.\n\n229\n00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.330\nThey're gonna die.\n\n230\n00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.530\nSo, it's really kind of a frightening\nproposition and it's not going away.\n\n231\n00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:45.000\nIn fact just to put this\nin perspective here,\n\n232\n00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.830\nI brought up on my screen just to show\nyou and maybe we can zoom that up a bit.\n\n233\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.770\nThis is actually from\nabout two months ago.\n\n234\n00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.680\nThis was put out there on\nMay 18th of this year.\n\n235\n00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.210\nIf we can get in a bit more on that.\n\n236\n00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.570\nYeah there we go.\n\n237\n00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:09.550\nWhat we have is,\nif you take a look at the numbers in here.\n\n238\n00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.777\nSo they've got a chart,\nthey're showing you kind of areas,\n\n239\n00:14:12.777 --> 00:14:14.750\nthe density of these systems.\n\n240\n00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.700\nLook where we are on it.\n\n241\n00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:24.750\nBut then you'll look at right over here\nto the side what they've put across here.\n\n242\n00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:29.580\nIf you can't read that, it says\nworldwide there's at least 15,000 SCADA\n\n243\n00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.780\nsystems that can be\nhacked by script kiddies.\n\n244\n00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.260\n>> Wow.\n>> That's the current assessment of people\n\n245\n00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.610\nthat are experts in there.\n\n246\n00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.520\nThen you look at this next\ngraphic underneath it,\n\n247\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.720\nbetween 1997 and 2014,\n\n248\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.546\nI mean, you had two attacks\nin 97 that were documented.\n\n249\n00:14:51.546 --> 00:14:56.002\nAnd you're getting it between 2012 and\n2014,\n\n250\n00:14:56.002 --> 00:15:01.550\nyou have 192, 156 and what is it,\n181 attacks against it.\n\n251\n00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:08.200\nThat's, I mean in the scheme of hacks that\nwe have happening, probably not that big.\n\n252\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:13.000\nBut consider the impact that could\nhappen if when those are successful and\n\n253\n00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.850\nif someone really just kind of\nhas it out for the population.\n\n254\n00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.220\nAnd then you could even see here,\n\n255\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:25.670\nthese are the different vendors\nwhose systems have been targeted.\n\n256\n00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.330\nI mean, you're seeing,\nover the different years,\n\n257\n00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.900\nhow much they've increased and\nwhat vendors are getting hit.\n\n258\n00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.190\nI mean, there's just a ton of them.\n\n259\n00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.920\nLook, Siemens is right down there,\njust above the bottom.\n\n260\n00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.800\nThat was the one I was talking about.\n\n261\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.810\nThose controllers and those systems\nare deployed in a lot of environments.\n\n262\n00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:52.272\nSo it could be quite frightening\nwhen you get down to it.\n\n263\n00:15:52.272 --> 00:15:57.451\nAnd then you even have it here,\nincidents and stuff like that,\n\n264\n00:15:57.451 --> 00:16:02.044\nthat have been reported and\nresponded to I mean, U.S.\n\n265\n00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:05.270\nhas over 48,000 hits on there and\n\n266\n00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:10.880\nthen you just kinda go down the list,\nyou can see it decreases.\n\n267\n00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.670\nWe've got us and Germany at the top and\n\n268\n00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:17.730\neveryone else just kinda trails off or\nmaybe isn't reporting it.\n\n269\n00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.860\nWe rely a lot on our\ntechnology in this country,\n\n270\n00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.966\nprobably more than a lot of countries do.\n\n271\n00:16:24.966 --> 00:16:30.743\nI don't wanna sound like I'm\nbeating my chest as an American or\n\n272\n00:16:30.743 --> 00:16:35.103\nanything like that, but\nI would almost say that\n\n273\n00:16:35.103 --> 00:16:40.015\nwe rely on our technology\nmore than anyone else does.\n\n274\n00:16:40.015 --> 00:16:44.594\nI almost wanna say that, but\nI know places in Asia and\n\n275\n00:16:44.594 --> 00:16:49.692\nstuff that do, but\nyou can see just looking at this list for\n\n276\n00:16:49.692 --> 00:16:54.479\nsomething like this,\nthe closest country from Asia is\n\n277\n00:16:54.479 --> 00:16:58.887\nTaiwan with about 2500 reported incidents.\n\n278\n00:16:58.887 --> 00:17:03.830\nAnd so, just really kinda think\nabout this type of stuff,\n\n279\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:09.410\nthe type of things we\nhave that are happening.\n\n280\n00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.704\nThis also just kinda illustrates\nsome other stuff they're saying,\n\n281\n00:17:13.704 --> 00:17:17.715\nwho's attacking and\nwhy they're attacking Skadden systems.\n\n282\n00:17:17.715 --> 00:17:22.124\nSo this is one I found, I mean,\nwho's attacking them, I mean,\n\n283\n00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:24.750\nit's across the board, you name it.\n\n284\n00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.792\nWe've got people across the board that\nare attacking these things and why?\n\n285\n00:17:27.792 --> 00:17:28.720\nYou name it.\n\n286\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.653\nPeople are attacking these for a lot\nof reasons and when you consider this,\n\n287\n00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:37.957\nlook at the fact that when they\nsay why they have protests, yeah,\n\n288\n00:17:37.957 --> 00:17:43.515\nyou could say that in a general area, that\nwould be the hacktivism stuff that we see,\n\n289\n00:17:43.515 --> 00:17:48.327\nbut this takes on a different form,\nit's not like someone's hacking.\n\n290\n00:17:48.327 --> 00:17:53.323\nIt's not like a group like PETA or\nsomeone hacking KFC's websites, and hey,\n\n291\n00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:54.696\nthis is what they do.\n\n292\n00:17:54.696 --> 00:18:00.041\nThis is someone that could be going after,\nthey're protesting nuclear energy or\n\n293\n00:18:00.041 --> 00:18:04.377\nsomething like that, and\nyou could go after one of those things and\n\n294\n00:18:04.377 --> 00:18:09.800\nthere are groups, even domestic terrorist\ngroups here in the U.S. that do that,\n\n295\n00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.460\nones like the Earth Liberation Front's\nthat has been around for ages.\n\n296\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:19.340\nIt's a loose kind of collective,\nit has cells all over the place.\n\n297\n00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.656\nI'm not gonna say they've\ndone stuff like this,\n\n298\n00:18:23.656 --> 00:18:28.310\nbut they've done some pretty radical\nstuff and they're not the only one, so\n\n299\n00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:32.100\nit brings in a new player to\nthe whole scheme of things.\n\n300\n00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.530\nSo if you deal with this stuff,\n\n301\n00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:38.300\nit really should bring into focus the type\nof stuff that you could be facing.\n\n302\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.800\n>> Yes, security is just\nparamount with systems like that.\n\n303\n00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.063\n>> Yes, it really is and\nwhen you look at that,\n\n304\n00:18:46.063 --> 00:18:50.107\nnotice the methods that they're using.\n\n305\n00:18:50.107 --> 00:18:54.375\nNone of those are things that should\nbe any surprise to us, should be really\n\n306\n00:18:54.375 --> 00:18:58.848\nany problem for us to deal with, but\nthey're happening because they just have\n\n307\n00:18:58.848 --> 00:19:03.048\nlaid the system bare and say,\nthe system does what it's supposed to, but\n\n308\n00:19:03.048 --> 00:19:07.517\namongst all the stuff we specced it out to\ndo that it was supposed to do, we never\n\n309\n00:19:07.517 --> 00:19:12.460\nonce considered security as one of those\nthings that should be paramount in it.\n\n310\n00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:17.560\nThat's changing, but\nit's not changing rapidly enough.\n\n311\n00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.612\nIt's one of those things things that when\nsomeone shines a spotlight on it, and\n\n312\n00:19:20.612 --> 00:19:23.805\nsays hey, get your crap together and\nfix this.\n\n313\n00:19:23.805 --> 00:19:28.675\nIt's something that they will put some\nmoney towards it, and start doing things,\n\n314\n00:19:28.675 --> 00:19:31.715\nbut then once that spotlight\ngoes over to something else,\n\n315\n00:19:31.715 --> 00:19:34.437\nwhatever the flavour of the month is,\nthey're like oh,\n\n316\n00:19:34.437 --> 00:19:37.577\nthey're not watching any more, okay,\ngo back to whatever you were doing.\n\n317\n00:19:37.577 --> 00:19:43.787\nSo these methods here are just a small\nnumber of things that happen that can\n\n318\n00:19:43.787 --> 00:19:48.153\ncause this to occur or like this systems\ngoing to be compromised, but they're not\n\n319\n00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:51.573\nanything that's really, oh wow,\nI never heard of spear fishing before.\n\n320\n00:19:51.573 --> 00:19:54.483\nYeah, you have, I'd call you out on it\nif you were here and you told me that.\n\n321\n00:19:54.483 --> 00:19:56.983\nYou say I haven't heard of spear fishing,\nokay get out of my face,\n\n322\n00:19:56.983 --> 00:19:58.766\nyou have, you've heard of that.\n\n323\n00:19:58.766 --> 00:20:03.676\nSo you've really gotta think about it,\n\n324\n00:20:03.676 --> 00:20:08.446\nwho's involved in this, why they might be\ndoing it, how they're carrying it out.\n\n325\n00:20:08.446 --> 00:20:13.328\nI find that when you talk about the who\nand here, that you have governments,\n\n326\n00:20:13.328 --> 00:20:17.619\nthat's one of the things that was\nactually pointed with Stuxnet.\n\n327\n00:20:17.619 --> 00:20:22.247\nStuxnet had a little too much\nintelligence behind it to be just\n\n328\n00:20:22.247 --> 00:20:25.189\na random thing that someone got lucky.\n\n329\n00:20:25.189 --> 00:20:30.116\nThere's been fingers pointed at the U.S.,\nthere's been fingers pointed at Israel,\n\n330\n00:20:30.116 --> 00:20:31.404\nand that's about it.\n\n331\n00:20:31.404 --> 00:20:36.070\n[LAUGH] So there's been fingers\npointing in those two directions.\n\n332\n00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:41.961\nIt's saying they were responsible for\nthe power grid issues we had here.\n\n333\n00:20:41.961 --> 00:20:46.492\nThe finger got pointed back towards China\nbecause a lot of the equipment was bought\n\n334\n00:20:46.492 --> 00:20:49.907\nfrom China and they found the last\none that lists for methods,\n\n335\n00:20:49.907 --> 00:20:51.286\nthey found back doors and\n\n336\n00:20:51.286 --> 00:20:55.424\nthe equipment they used to tie in this\nnew smart grid and intelligent grid,\n\n337\n00:20:55.424 --> 00:21:00.110\nthey bought those components from China,\nthey found back doors implanted on them.\n\n338\n00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:05.080\nAll China had to do is hey, flip a switch\nand they could have shut down major\n\n339\n00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.310\nsections of the grid, but someone did\nan audit on these things and found it.\n\n340\n00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.790\nThat's where the pen testers come in.\n\n341\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.418\nSo they've learned,\n\n342\n00:21:14.418 --> 00:21:20.240\nat least the electrical industry's\nlearned from that little incident.\n\n343\n00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:25.427\nI found out in California,\n\n344\n00:21:25.427 --> 00:21:31.020\njust within the state of California,\nlocal energy companies,\n\n345\n00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.840\nwe're not talking of the big big big ones,\nwe're talking small local ones, that don't\n\n346\n00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.940\nhave the budgets that the big guys do,\nthey're taking people like myself,\n\n347\n00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.620\nand this isn't to pump myself up or\n\n348\n00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.774\nanything, they're taking people\nlike myself that are pen testers.\n\n349\n00:21:47.774 --> 00:21:50.302\nI don't know anything\nabout the energy industry,\n\n350\n00:21:50.302 --> 00:21:53.709\nit's not an industry that I've ever\nreally had to get that far into,\n\n351\n00:21:53.709 --> 00:21:56.820\nI've worked with it, but\nat a very superficial level.\n\n352\n00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.930\nI don't know all the ins and\nouts and regulations and\n\n353\n00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.686\nall that,\ndon't really have any plans to learn that.\n\n354\n00:22:01.686 --> 00:22:06.650\nThat's not something that\nI need to get into, but\n\n355\n00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:10.370\nthey were approaching people like\nmyself and just saying okay well,\n\n356\n00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:13.490\nwe need someone that knows security,\nwe're just going to pair them up with\n\n357\n00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.420\nsomeone that does know the industry, and\nwe're going to have you go to different\n\n358\n00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.570\nenergy companies in the state that this\ncompany had to be contracted with and\n\n359\n00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:28.570\nthey were paying people like insane\namounts of money to go out and\n\n360\n00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.130\nlook at these things cuz they realize\nhow serious it is that they really\n\n361\n00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:36.260\nneed to cough up the bucks to get this\nfixed now before something major happens.\n\n362\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:41.100\nI mean you got people out there that\nhave got pen testing backgrounds,\n\n363\n00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.307\nthat know nothing about the energy\nfield that are getting paid like $4 or\n\n364\n00:22:44.307 --> 00:22:50.680\n500 an hour to do this because they're\njust like, we have to get top talent.\n\n365\n00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.837\nWe have to get them in here now, we can't\nwait cuz something bad's gonna happen if\n\n366\n00:22:55.837 --> 00:23:01.101\nwe keep sitting on our butts, so we gotta\ncough up the dough and make things happen.\n\n367\n00:23:01.101 --> 00:23:04.034\nSo just in case you guys want\nto make some extra money,\n\n368\n00:23:04.034 --> 00:23:06.195\nthere you go because I ain't doing it.\n\n369\n00:23:06.195 --> 00:23:09.366\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right Sean,\n\n370\n00:23:09.366 --> 00:23:13.479\nwell a lot of great information there\nabout Skadden and the vulnerabilities\n\n371\n00:23:13.479 --> 00:23:17.911\nassociated with and if you happen to work\nwith that you've gotta be aware of that so\n\n372\n00:23:17.911 --> 00:23:21.960\nwe can make sure that we think about\nsecurity and design a secure system.\n\n373\n00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.620\nSo anything else we need to talk\nabout before we wrap this one up?\n\n374\n00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:30.590\n>> I would encourage everybody\nthat's watching this either live or\n\n375\n00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:35.820\nrecorded, you may seriously wanna\ntake a good look at this stuff\n\n376\n00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.879\nbecause this really affects\nall of us with Skadden stuff.\n\n377\n00:23:40.879 --> 00:23:45.160\nIt just really affects all of us because\nthe utilities, all of those things,\n\n378\n00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.590\nwe all use them, we all work and so\nhopefully, we are all in some way shape or\n\n379\n00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.370\nform involved in security, I'm assuming\nsince if you are watching this,\n\n380\n00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:57.050\nit's something that you should\nreally be concerned about and\n\n381\n00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.280\nbe trying to kind of see\nif you can involved,\n\n382\n00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:05.630\nif there's any way you can push more\nattention onto this, it really helps.\n\n383\n00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.550\nHeck, I would tell people to even\nthink about there's an organization\n\n384\n00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:14.960\nthat works in the U.S. that works with\nthe FBI it's called InfraGuard and\n\n385\n00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.420\nit's a group that the FBI works with and\nthey share information between a critical\n\n386\n00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:24.180\ninfrastructure and stuff like that to\nmake sure that systems are safe and\n\n387\n00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.730\nsecure and they have a basically early\nwarning system if something happens.\n\n388\n00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:34.420\nIt's something that you guys out here\nwatching me would actually be consider\n\n389\n00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.940\njoining because it's something that you\ncan get good information yourself but\n\n390\n00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.755\nalso can see how you fit in and\nno matter what you do,\n\n391\n00:24:40.755 --> 00:24:43.333\nyou fit into the larger big picture.\n\n392\n00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:50.000\nAnd that InfraGuard is free to join,\nso you might as well.\n\n393\n00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.876\n>> Very good.\n\n394\n00:24:50.876 --> 00:24:52.830\nAll right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, that's gonna do it for\n\n395\n00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:56.620\nanother one of our episodes, so\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n396\n00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.326\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n397\n00:24:57.326 --> 00:24:59.137\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n398\n00:24:59.137 --> 00:25:05.540\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.200\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday with me is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.210\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.470\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.040\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.910\n>> Cannot complain.\n\n8\n00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.030\nHere we are going another episode of our\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner.\n\n9\n00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.211\nIn this episode we're gonna be talking\nabout that pesky little protocol suite\n\n10\n00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:27.790\nTCP/IP.\n\n11\n00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.098\nIt's everywhere right, and we gotta\nmake sure we understand how it works so\n\n12\n00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:33.890\nwe can secure it properly.\n\n13\n00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.936\n>> All right, I'm out, I'm done.\n\n14\n00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:38.880\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's it no more I can't take it.\n\n15\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.425\nYeah, any questions?\n\n16\n00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:45.920\n>> [LAUGH] It is something that we\nprobably have a little experience with\n\n17\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.260\nif we're at this point and we're studying\nfor our Advanced Security Practitioner.\n\n18\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.363\nThat means we've most likely\nbeen through A+ and Net+ and\n\n19\n00:00:52.363 --> 00:00:55.630\nSecurity+ and maybe some Windows\ncourses and things like that,\n\n20\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.525\nso we should be familiar\nwith that TCP/IP suite.\n\n21\n00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:02.703\nWhat do they call out, anything any\ndifferent that they really call out in\n\n22\n00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:04.867\nthis one other than knowing\nthose fundamentals?\n\n23\n00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:06.508\n>> No, that's the thing.\n\n24\n00:01:06.508 --> 00:01:09.470\nIf you have a handle on TCP/IP already,\n\n25\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.305\nwhich you really should have\nif you're up at this point.\n\n26\n00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:17.895\nWe shouldn't be re-teaching you how to,\n\n27\n00:01:17.895 --> 00:01:22.880\nwhat an IP address is and how to do\nthe binary, and all that type of stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.490\nWe should not be doing that.\n\n29\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.550\nAnd then things like OSI and\nthe TCP/IP model.\n\n30\n00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.200\nThose are things that you should\nalready have a handle on.\n\n31\n00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.155\nThose are things that, why they don't\nreally have prerequisites for this,\n\n32\n00:01:37.155 --> 00:01:43.015\nit's really something that, if you got\nthis far, you should have knowledge\n\n33\n00:01:43.015 --> 00:01:47.455\nequivalent to what's on the Network+,\nwhere this is covered ad nauseum.\n\n34\n00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:53.000\nAnd so yeah, there's really not\nany new ground being broken.\n\n35\n00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.630\nIf you can go through all seven layers\nof OSI and go through the layers\n\n36\n00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.650\nof TCP/IP and understand what those mean,\nyou're in perfectly good shape.\n\n37\n00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.760\nIf you understand why they're there,\nhow they work, you're fine.\n\n38\n00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.646\nYou don't really have to\ngo any further than that.\n\n39\n00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:12.590\nObviously TCP/IP they're putting\nit in here for network design,\n\n40\n00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.970\nbecause you're not really gonna run\ninto a network that doesn't use it.\n\n41\n00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.870\nThat's extremely rare.\n\n42\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.000\nYeah I know they're out there,\n\n43\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.330\nso I don't need any [LAUGH]\nnasty letters or anything.\n\n44\n00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.480\nYeah I know they're out there, but\n\n45\n00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.560\nit's just something that you'd\nexpect to run into all the time.\n\n46\n00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.710\nIt's something that you might\nsee a couple in your career,\n\n47\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.440\nyou might never see anything\nexcept TCP/IP based network.\n\n48\n00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.720\nSo we definitely have to\nhave a very good command\n\n49\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.260\nof what TCP/IP is and\nonce you've got that, you're good,\n\n50\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.890\nand pretty much, most of the stuff you\nhave IP4, IP6, that's the big one.\n\n51\n00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.200\nYou might happen to have jumped\ninto the pool with IP6 yet.\n\n52\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.480\nYou're going to,\nyou're definitely going to.\n\n53\n00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.000\nYeah, if you've got a good handle\non it now, which you should,\n\n54\n00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.529\nthen you're in pretty good shape.\n\n55\n00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.940\n>> All right, so\nwe can talk about the OSI model.\n\n56\n00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.530\nI think we're all again,\nlike Sean said, familiar with that.\n\n57\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.330\nWe've got our different little\nsayings that we use to remember\n\n58\n00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.690\nour layers of the OSI model.\n\n59\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.569\nProbably important to understand what\ndifferent protocols are occurring at\n\n60\n00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.630\nthe different layers, I would assume.\n\n61\n00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.446\n>> Yeah, you should know if I was to\nthrow out there things like saying\n\n62\n00:03:23.446 --> 00:03:25.690\nwhere does ARP come into play?\n\n63\n00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.873\nWhere is TCP and UDP and all those ones?\n\n64\n00:03:29.873 --> 00:03:31.960\nWhat layer would they be at?\n\n65\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.870\nYou need to know that.\n\n66\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.738\nYou need to have a command of that and\nbe able to just go through and\n\n67\n00:03:36.738 --> 00:03:40.980\njust quote those without any problem.\n\n68\n00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.170\nAnd to be honest, it's not just\n\n69\n00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.120\nshowing that you have a command of\nTCP/IP and the whole suite of protocols.\n\n70\n00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.750\nThat's really the easy part.\n\n71\n00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.890\nI know that's kind of a simple thing for\nus to say, it's like, oh,\n\n72\n00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.050\nthat's the easy part.\n\n73\n00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.910\nWell, let's also break this down\na bit more here is that, do you know\n\n74\n00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.800\nenough about OSI to understand what I\nmean when I say hey, that box over there,\n\n75\n00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.150\nthat's a Layer-2 device, and that one\nover there, that's a Layer-3 device?\n\n76\n00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.370\nDo you know that means?\n\n77\n00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.050\nYou better, it's very simple.\n\n78\n00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.550\nIf we look at a firewall and they tell you\nfirewall's a certain type of firewall,\n\n79\n00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.620\nyou can use OSI or\nTCP/IP model if you want,\n\n80\n00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.810\nand you can tell where filtering and\nall that stuff's coming in.\n\n81\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.490\nSo it really gets you a long\nway down the line to have\n\n82\n00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.960\na good understanding of the TCP/IP suite\nand how OSI and all these things fit in.\n\n83\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.020\nAgain, it's not like something that\nwe're just gonna say, eh, heck.\n\n84\n00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.640\nI'm gonna reteach you all this again.\n\n85\n00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.340\nWe're assuming that you've\nalready got a good handle on it,\n\n86\n00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.800\nyou just have to understand how\nit fits in and how routing works.\n\n87\n00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.140\nExpect to see stuff like routing\nprotocols mentioned in here.\n\n88\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.140\nAnd we won't mention routing protocols\nnow because we've got a section\n\n89\n00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.405\non that just to kind of really kinda\nmake sure we've got a handle on that.\n\n90\n00:05:09.405 --> 00:05:14.586\nSo things like that.\n\n91\n00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:18.991\n[COUGH] You'll need to know things\nlike not only routing protocols,\n\n92\n00:05:18.991 --> 00:05:21.155\nhow routing works, switching,\n\n93\n00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:26.920\nall those things are stuff that you would\nbe doing as part of your network design.\n\n94\n00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.420\nPeriod, that's it.\n\n95\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.146\nWhen you put those things together,\n\n96\n00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:33.330\nthere's no way you're not gonna\nconsider that and be successful.\n\n97\n00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.100\n>> Right and then, so again things\nthat we probably should already know.\n\n98\n00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.270\nThe OSI model has, what,\nseven layers on that guy?\n\n99\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.730\nThe TCP/IP suite they break it down\ninto four layers, if I remember right.\n\n100\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.600\nI remember that application, they've\ngot that application layer at the top\n\n101\n00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.690\nthat really represents the application,\nsession, and\n\n102\n00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.810\npresentation layers in that OSI model.\n\n103\n00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.210\nThey got the transports are one to one,\nthen they got that internet layer that\n\n104\n00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.113\nmaps to the network\nlayer in the OSI model.\n\n105\n00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:08.305\nAnd then the network interface is really\nthe data link layer in the OSI model.\n\n106\n00:06:09.315 --> 00:06:10.615\nSo it's similar.\n\n107\n00:06:10.615 --> 00:06:11.934\nRemember the OSI model is just that.\n\n108\n00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:18.285\nIt's a model, TCP/IP follows that model,\nbut they don't have to follow it exactly.\n\n109\n00:06:18.285 --> 00:06:19.105\nAnd then as you said,\n\n110\n00:06:19.105 --> 00:06:21.505\nknowing some of the different protocols\nthat occur at the different layers.\n\n111\n00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:26.910\nLike when we're talking about that\napplication layer, HTTP, DNS, FTP, Telnet.\n\n112\n00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.290\nThose guys are all way up there.\n\n113\n00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.470\nThe transport layer, we got things\nlike TCP and UDP, ping, or IGMP.\n\n114\n00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.260\nWhat I'm trying to say, what else?\n\n115\n00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.920\nThe Internet layer, you got IP and IPsec.\n\n116\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.570\nRemember that occurs down there at that\nInternet layer, which is pretty low down.\n\n117\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.710\nIt's way below all of your applications\nthat are occurring up there higher\n\n118\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.650\nin the model.\n\n119\n00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.270\nWhich was one of the great\nthings about IPsec because\n\n120\n00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.080\nthe applications didn't have\nto be aware of it, right?\n\n121\n00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.570\nIt didn't get encrypted until the data had\nalready gone down through the different\n\n122\n00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.280\nlayers and\nmade it down to that Internet layer.\n\n123\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.580\nAnd the same thing on\nthe way up on the other side,\n\n124\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.270\nit gets decrypted before it ever\nmakes back to the applications, so\n\n125\n00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.870\nIP6 was really good in respect, for\nthe fact that I can use it with anything.\n\n126\n00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.100\nThe applications did not\nhave to be aware of IPSec.\n\n127\n00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.820\nAnd then at the bottom,\nyou got your network interface layer,\n\n128\n00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.780\nwhere you got your Ethernet, token ring,\nyour different networking protocols.\n\n129\n00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.130\nSo again, things we should really\nbe familiar with from Network+,\n\n130\n00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.120\nbut definitely important when we're\ndesigning our network, right Sean?\n\n131\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.962\nBecause we've gotta understand\nhow we're putting it together,\n\n132\n00:07:28.962 --> 00:07:32.120\nhow we plan on communicating, and\nwhere we need to focus our security on.\n\n133\n00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.221\n>> Yeah it absolutely is and\nI'll be the first one to tell you,\n\n134\n00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:38.517\nI know OSI and the TCP/IP model,\n\n135\n00:07:38.517 --> 00:07:43.454\nthose things aren't the most exciting\nglamorous thing to talk about.\n\n136\n00:07:43.454 --> 00:07:46.424\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Notice Mike was over here, he was like,\n\n137\n00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:48.140\nI think it's got seven layers of thought.\n\n138\n00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.690\nHe didn't forget,\n\n139\n00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.950\nhe just doesn't want to have flashbacks\nlike I do when I think about this stuff.\n\n140\n00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.300\n>> [LAUGH] It is one of those\nthings that you memorize and\n\n141\n00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.870\nyou learn for Network+ to pass\nthose exams and things like that.\n\n142\n00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.600\nIn the real world, we don't deal\nwith it directly all that much.\n\n143\n00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.350\nI mean, it definitely has an impact and\nwe definitely have to understand it for\n\n144\n00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.990\nthe exams and for\nworking out there in the real world, but\n\n145\n00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.870\nit is something that I will,\nI've only got so much room up there right?\n\n146\n00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.048\nI gotta push some of that stuff\nout to learn new stuff so\n\n147\n00:08:16.048 --> 00:08:19.145\n[LAUGH] the OSI model is just one of\nthose things that I just push out.\n\n148\n00:08:19.145 --> 00:08:21.482\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah I don't blame you.\n\n149\n00:08:21.482 --> 00:08:24.999\nI do not like the OSI model.\n\n150\n00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:26.077\nI don't like it.\n\n151\n00:08:26.077 --> 00:08:31.025\nBut it's necessary and if you\nunderstand the history behind it and\n\n152\n00:08:31.025 --> 00:08:36.061\nhow everyone's playing with their\nown rules before they had this,\n\n153\n00:08:36.061 --> 00:08:39.725\nyou understand directly\nwhy they had to do this.\n\n154\n00:08:39.725 --> 00:08:43.230\nThey've simplified it a bit\nafter they went OSI and\n\n155\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.590\nthen they started going TCP/IP and\nsaid well, we don't need this\n\n156\n00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.810\nuniversally accepted model that\ntakes care of all these protocols.\n\n157\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.620\nWe can kinda squash that down and\nput on a diet and\n\n158\n00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.310\nsay oh, four layers,\nthat's all you need, so.\n\n159\n00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.165\n>> Seven layer cake was starting\nto add up on my waistline now.\n\n160\n00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:02.750\n[LAUGH]\n>> They actually downsized that,\n\n161\n00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.630\njust like everything in the tech industry,\nthey downsized the OSI models.\n\n162\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.980\nIt's like you get four layers.\n\n163\n00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.950\nSo, it's like the lowest\nbidder type thing.\n\n164\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.680\nI can do it in four layers.\n\n165\n00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.850\nSo that's to give you\nthe background though,\n\n166\n00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:24.698\nthat's why you need to know OSI and know\nTCP/IP, know the order, know what happens.\n\n167\n00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:32.047\nYou do not need to become the guru\nof OSI and TCP/IP models.\n\n168\n00:09:32.047 --> 00:09:36.296\nI mean don't try to go through and\ntry to memorize RFCs and IEEE standards,\n\n169\n00:09:36.296 --> 00:09:37.350\nall that.\n\n170\n00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.000\nNot necessary, waste of your time.\n\n171\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.250\nSo the stuff you have now,\nwith all the TCP/IP stuff is good.\n\n172\n00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.365\nMake sure you know the models and\n\n173\n00:09:47.365 --> 00:09:50.420\nthen you've pretty much made\na clean getaway at that point.\n\n174\n00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.170\nDo make sure you know\nhow to use the tools.\n\n175\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:57.930\nThings like ping, ipconfig,\ntraceroute, stuff like that.\n\n176\n00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.270\nMake sure you know those.\n\n177\n00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.330\nI think it's probably something that's\nfair to say that probably just about\n\n178\n00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.900\neveryone here has used them.\n\n179\n00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.307\nI wanna say everyone, but.\n\n180\n00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:09.262\n>> [CROSSTALK] Everyone, yeah, yeah.\n\n181\n00:10:09.262 --> 00:10:12.501\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, someone's right there going, hey,\n\n182\n00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:15.210\nI was trying to tune into Netflix,\nhow'd I get over here?\n\n183\n00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.761\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But no, in all seriousness,\n\n184\n00:10:18.761 --> 00:10:21.865\nthere may be some of you\nthat haven't had to do that.\n\n185\n00:10:21.865 --> 00:10:26.525\nTotally understand but\nyou do need to know it for those.\n\n186\n00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:30.469\nMake sure you've got familiarity with\nthose tools and everything for the exam,\n\n187\n00:10:30.469 --> 00:10:32.040\nand then you're fine.\n\n188\n00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.300\nJust to throw it in there, if you're\ngonna go into pen testing at any point,\n\n189\n00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.240\nif you don't know those models,\nyou better start.\n\n190\n00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.927\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You better start.\n\n191\n00:10:40.927 --> 00:10:46.327\nYou will not be able to effectively\ndo things like session hijacking and\n\n192\n00:10:46.327 --> 00:10:47.660\nport scans.\n\n193\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.700\nYou won't be able to really, effectively\nunderstand those and why you're doing\n\n194\n00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.610\nthem and why they work and how to look for\nthem, unless you know stuff like this.\n\n195\n00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.845\nSo it's not just busywork\nthey're giving you.\n\n196\n00:11:00.845 --> 00:11:02.610\n>> So gotta study that, gotta understand.\n\n197\n00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.571\nI threw a link in the chat\nroom in there and\n\n198\n00:11:04.571 --> 00:11:06.890\nI'll make sure it's in\nthe show notes as well.\n\n199\n00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.310\nJust a nice little drawing I picked\nup from Technet from Microsoft.\n\n200\n00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:16.140\nIt compares, it's got the OSI side by side\nwith the TCP/IP model, side by side with\n\n201\n00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.310\nsome applications and protocols that\nexist at those different layers.\n\n202\n00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:25.105\nAnd understanding where those\nprotocols reside can definitely\n\n203\n00:11:25.105 --> 00:11:28.120\nhelp us figure out ways to secure them.\n\n204\n00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.400\nSo I don't know Sean, like you say,\nTCP is not the biggest topic to talk\n\n205\n00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.470\nabout when it comes to\nsecuring our communications.\n\n206\n00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.740\nAnything else we wanna throw in there?\n\n207\n00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:43.515\n>> Well, do remember, it's something\nI really kind of want to emphasize\n\n208\n00:11:43.515 --> 00:11:48.800\nwith this is, when you talk about\nTCP/IP you have IP4 and IP6.\n\n209\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:55.350\nIP4 is the one that is\nin massive usage today.\n\n210\n00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:59.408\nIP6 is really still a small amount\nin the market relatively speaking.\n\n211\n00:11:59.408 --> 00:12:06.720\nIt's growing and it's out there, but it's\nstill not taking up as much as IP4 is.\n\n212\n00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.720\nThe thing with IP4 that\nwe really need to keep in\n\n213\n00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.560\nfocus when we're talking about security,\ncuz that's the overriding theme here.\n\n214\n00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:20.620\nIs that when you look at things like the\nOSI model, look at the TCP/IP model, and\n\n215\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:25.880\nyou look at IP4 in the context of that,\njust by\n\n216\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.740\nchattering about that stuff and going over\nit, you don't hear security mentioned.\n\n217\n00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.240\nYou really don't, it's not something\nthat they really get behind.\n\n218\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.210\nIt's kind of like, oh, you can move\ndata from here to here and do this,\n\n219\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.310\nthis, and this.\n\n220\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.110\nAnd then you raise your hand go,\nwell what about security?\n\n221\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.600\nAnd they're basically like shut up.\n\n222\n00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.485\nWe don't want to hear from you.\n\n223\n00:12:42.485 --> 00:12:44.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's cuz they didn't think,\n\n224\n00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.300\nthey didn't have that\nas part of their goals.\n\n225\n00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:53.670\nSo they built a protocol, IP4,\nthat works very effectively,\n\n226\n00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:59.040\ndoes its job, scaled up way beyond\ntheir wildest imaginations,\n\n227\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.300\nand has done its job incredibly well.\n\n228\n00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.870\nSo if you look at the scalability,\nthe extensibility and performance,\n\n229\n00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:10.730\nit's done those things\nextremely well over the years.\n\n230\n00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.790\nWhat it hasn't done is, is it has\nnot addressed the security problem.\n\n231\n00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:19.150\nSo it means with all those IP4\nbased solutions, we have to\n\n232\n00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.270\nbring our own solutions to the table and\nmechanisms to actually secure that.\n\n233\n00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:27.846\nAnd that kind of goes back to some of\nour earlier topics in the form of IPSec,\n\n234\n00:13:27.846 --> 00:13:29.303\nyou mentioned.\n\n235\n00:13:29.303 --> 00:13:34.465\nThere's SSL, VPNs,\nplus a whole bunch of other technologies.\n\n236\n00:13:34.465 --> 00:13:37.755\nTypically all those\ntechnologies fit right within\n\n237\n00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:42.165\nthe areas of encryption and cryptography.\n\n238\n00:13:42.165 --> 00:13:43.635\nThere are some ones that don't.\n\n239\n00:13:43.635 --> 00:13:47.445\nThere's things like switches where\nyou can create VLANs to isolate and\n\n240\n00:13:47.445 --> 00:13:48.715\ncontrol traffic.\n\n241\n00:13:48.715 --> 00:13:52.835\nThat would definitely be providing\nsome measure of security IP4\n\n242\n00:13:52.835 --> 00:13:54.730\nitself can't provide.\n\n243\n00:13:54.730 --> 00:14:00.740\nSo you do need to remember that IP4 as it\nis, there's no security mechanisms in it.\n\n244\n00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.822\nAnything you hear in the form of\nacknowledgements or anything like that,\n\n245\n00:14:03.822 --> 00:14:05.670\nthose are done just to say,\nhey it got here.\n\n246\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:10.393\nThat's not to say hey there's some special\nhandshake going on that confirms you got\n\n247\n00:14:10.393 --> 00:14:12.570\nthe secret password or something.\n\n248\n00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.680\nThe only handshaking going is like hey,\nnice to meet you, what do you need?\n\n249\n00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.140\nThat's about it.\n\n250\n00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.309\nIP6 changes that though.\n\n251\n00:14:19.309 --> 00:14:24.970\nIP6 security is a requirement,\nit's mandatory as part of that spec.\n\n252\n00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.560\nSo all the stuff that was been grafted on,\nor\n\n253\n00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.460\nduct taped onto IP4 after the fact\nis inherent in the design of IP6.\n\n254\n00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.176\nIt didn't get out the door without them\nsaying, hey we learned all these lessons\n\n255\n00:14:38.176 --> 00:14:40.810\nwith IP4 over the years being hacked and\nmonkeyed with.\n\n256\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:45.015\nNow we're gonna take all those lessons and\nfigure out how to address those in\n\n257\n00:14:45.015 --> 00:14:49.300\nthe design of IP6 and they've actually\ndone a pretty good job at doing that.\n\n258\n00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:55.570\nYeah, there's some areas that still\nkinda weak, but that's a relative term.\n\n259\n00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.130\nThey're way stronger\nthan they were before.\n\n260\n00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.650\nSo we're making some good headway there.\n\n261\n00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:05.250\nSo IP6 does have exciting things for\nus down the road.\n\n262\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.930\nSo, just to kind of throw that out there.\n\n263\n00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.812\n>> All right, well, Sean,\na lot of good information about TCP/IP and\n\n264\n00:15:11.812 --> 00:15:15.143\nwe gotta make sure that we understand\nwhat's going on at the different layers so\n\n265\n00:15:15.143 --> 00:15:17.170\nwe can keep our networks safe.\n\n266\n00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:22.090\nUsing our IP addressing schemes to\nkeep our networks safe, subnetting.\n\n267\n00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.240\nUsing firewall rules and\nrouter rules to control traffic\n\n268\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.150\nthat's allowed to flow through our\nnetworks or not allowed to flow.\n\n269\n00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.440\nAnything else we want to throw\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n270\n00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.900\n>> No I think we hit this one pretty well.\n\n271\n00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.460\nI think we got the point home that\n\n272\n00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.360\nthis is something that hopefully you've\ngot a good handle on at this point.\n\n273\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.965\nIf not, you've got studying to do.\n\n274\n00:15:43.965 --> 00:15:46.606\nFortunately, we have here at ITPro,\n\n275\n00:15:46.606 --> 00:15:51.400\nwe've got the Network+ courses and\nstuff like that to help you out.\n\n276\n00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.940\nIf you don't have a good command or\nyou feel kind of weak or\n\n277\n00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.120\nsomething in these areas, you've got\nthe resource included right there for\n\n278\n00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.910\nyou to review it, and\nI would strongly encourage that.\n\n279\n00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.430\nBecause as you go further and\nfurther into the area of security and\n\n280\n00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:13.220\nstart moving up the food chain, these are\nthings that are just gonna de-emphasize,\n\n281\n00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.270\nand eventually they're\njust gonna disappear.\n\n282\n00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.542\nDoesn't mean you don't need to know them.\n\n283\n00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:19.325\nSomeone's gonna say, well,\nit's given that you know that.\n\n284\n00:16:19.325 --> 00:16:20.572\nHow come you don't?\n\n285\n00:16:20.572 --> 00:16:23.249\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, it's assumed.\n\n286\n00:16:23.249 --> 00:16:27.700\nThey're onto bigger and\nbetter stuff at that point.\n\n287\n00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.420\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, that's gonna do it for\n\n288\n00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.430\nanother episode here at ITProTV.\n\n289\n00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.990\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike

00:00:15.840\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.960\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.520\n>> Doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.250\n>> Fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.890\nAnother exciting episode\ncoming your way and\n\n8\n00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.910\nour CompTIA advanced security\npractitioner series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.380\nAnd in particular this one we're gonna\nbe looking at secure facility solutions.\n\n10\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.245\nSo ways we can work with that\nphysical security, right Sean.\n\n11\n00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:36.020\n>> Yeah that's a part of the equation\nthat you can't overlook.\n\n12\n00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.120\nIt's like you have to really\nconsider the fact that,\n\n13\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.480\nyeah you've got all this\nnice wonderful technology.\n\n14\n00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.330\nAnd days you can use to deploy to make\nyour network communication safer.\n\n15\n00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.250\nAnd that's a great thing but\nthen there's also the whole concept of\n\n16\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.640\nwhat if someone can actually get in and\ntouch the stuff.\n\n17\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.360\nOnce they get in and do that then your\nnetwork isn't your network anymore.\n\n18\n00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.040\nIt's officially theirs.\n\n19\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.800\nThey've planted the flag.\n\n20\n00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.010\nSo we have to think about\nthat part of things as well.\n\n21\n00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.810\nHow can we physically secure that.\n\n22\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.910\nAnd, fortunately,\na lot of this work's been done.\n\n23\n00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.120\nWe're just applying it to what we have\nalready existing, to the facilities.\n\n24\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.050\nWe're putting our networks in and,\nhow we route things.\n\n25\n00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.580\nPeople have already\nthought about this stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.070\nSo we just have to consult those things,\nor get someone to come in and\n\n27\n00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.240\ntake care of that side of it for\nus, and we're good.\n\n28\n00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.600\n>> And, it's one of those things where\na lot of times it's more difficult,\n\n29\n00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.220\nbecause we might have inherited a building\nor the building wasn't designed for\n\n30\n00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.510\nwhat we're using it for now.\n\n31\n00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.150\nIt's been repurposed and then trying to\nsecure those facilities becomes difficult.\n\n32\n00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.410\nYou and I've both made jokes and stories\nabout networks where you run into them and\n\n33\n00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.630\ntheir server closet is like\nthe old maintenance closet or\n\n34\n00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.765\nsomething like that and\nit's difficult to secure that.\n\n35\n00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:58.120\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, that seems like a horror story.\n\n36\n00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.410\nLike whoa, really?\n\n37\n00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.250\n[LAUGH] Not only is it in a place\nthat is really, really bad and\n\n38\n00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.750\nyou should not see sensitive\nnetworking equipment there.\n\n39\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.880\nYou really shouldn't see\nanything besides some buckets and\n\n40\n00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.880\nsome mops there to be stored\nif you're gonna do that.\n\n41\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.450\nAnd you see them sitting in those places.\n\n42\n00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.517\nProblem with those places is,\n\n43\n00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:25.827\nnot only do they not offer really any\nappreciable security as far as making sure\n\n44\n00:02:25.827 --> 00:02:28.715\nthat they're safe from\nany environmental things.\n\n45\n00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:34.036\nIn a lot of cases, it also can be\nphysically accessed by individuals, stuff\n\n46\n00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:40.100\ncan get plugged in, stuff can get removed\njust as easily, and then where are you?\n\n47\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.160\nYou see those things\nhappen just all the time.\n\n48\n00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.870\nYou see places where, I've literally\nseen places where people come in,\n\n49\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.180\nred teams, people that do teams\nof pen testers, have come in and\n\n50\n00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.570\nplugged in their own routers and switches,\nand plugged them right onto the network.\n\n51\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.130\nThey're in the wiring closet, and said,\nhey, I'll be here popped them in and\n\n52\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.920\nthat was it.\n\n53\n00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.040\nAnd sometimes I heard of one,\nspecifically,\n\n54\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.010\njust kind of narrow it down, they left\ntheir stuff in place for about two months.\n\n55\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.250\nAnd they removed it when\nthey did the pin test,\n\n56\n00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.880\nthey gave them the report and everything.\n\n57\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.020\nSays hey, let me show you something.\n\n58\n00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.640\nYeah see this?\n\n59\n00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.450\nThis isn't yours, [LAUGH].\n\n60\n00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.247\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n61\n00:03:20.247 --> 00:03:21.850\n>> How did that get there?\n\n62\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.690\nWell you weren't paying attention,\nthat's how it got there.\n\n63\n00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.780\n>> I know Don was sharing a story not too\nlong ago about a facility that's a data\n\n64\n00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.450\ncenter, it's one of these\nhuge warehouse buildings and\n\n65\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.920\nit was a data center so lots and\nlots and lots of servers in there.\n\n66\n00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.850\nTop of the line technologies in place, and\n\n67\n00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.380\nsecurity as far as the network goes, and\nall of this, and they got taken down,\n\n68\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.000\nbecause somebody went on the grounds,\ncame up to the building, and\n\n69\n00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.830\ntook something and shoved it down\ninto the fan on the AC systems.\n\n70\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.240\nWhich shut the AC system down,\nwhich raised the internal temperatures,\n\n71\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.440\noffice server shut, I can't even get talk,\nstart shutting down.\n\n72\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.130\nThey did a denial of service,\n\n73\n00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.000\nthey affectingly took this data\nwarehouse out with a broomstick.\n\n74\n00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.650\nAnd that's physical security, right?\n\n75\n00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.330\nNo fences, no guards, no cameras.\n\n76\n00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.340\nThese things were accessible by\nanyone that wanted to walk up.\n\n77\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.790\n>> You know that is funny to\nhear something like that.\n\n78\n00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.690\nDid it have to be someone shoving\nsomething down there to shut the AC out?\n\n79\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.280\nYou know, heck,\nthat's something that's a deliberate act.\n\n80\n00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.445\nBut, what's to say you\ndon't get some wild life or\n\n81\n00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:38.809\nsomething going into that same vent.\n\n82\n00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:40.233\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> It's happened.\n\n83\n00:04:40.233 --> 00:04:45.549\nI know of a company that I was at in\nthe past that they had one of their\n\n84\n00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:51.400\ncomputers shut down because [LAUGH]\nit was a brand new one, too.\n\n85\n00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.440\nAnd they told me it was really funny,\nI wasn't there for it but they told me it\n\n86\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.950\nwas really funny because they let\npeople bring their pets to work, and\n\n87\n00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.230\nit was supposed to be a dog policy, then\nsome people started bringing their cats,\n\n88\n00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.900\nthen some people started\nbringing the more exotic stuff.\n\n89\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.090\nAnd somebody brought in an iguana and\n\n90\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.070\nthat thing disappeared over the weekend,\nthey couldn't find out where it was and\n\n91\n00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.000\nthen someone turned their computer on and\nit didn't work.\n\n92\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.460\nSo the IT came out for that site,\ncame out and pulled the hatch off of it.\n\n93\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.170\nAnd they say he screamed\nlike a little girl,\n\n94\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.220\nlike a little three year old girl or\nsomething.\n\n95\n00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.180\nBecause that iguana had gone in through\none of the hatches that was left open\n\n96\n00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.010\nin the back for the expansion cards.\n\n97\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.080\nWent right in through and then laid on\nthe mother board where it was warm and\n\n98\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.605\nthen promptly shorted it out and\nit exploded inside of the thing.\n\n99\n00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:36.240\n[LAUGH].\n>> Doesn't necessarily need to be\n\n100\n00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.080\nthat stuff.\n\n101\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.725\nThat's going to haunt\nyour dreams ain't it?\n\n102\n00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:39.270\n[LAUGH].\n>> No doubt.\n\n103\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.565\n>> Probably dinner time for\nsome people out there.\n\n104\n00:05:41.565 --> 00:05:42.650\nBon appetit!\n[LAUGH].\n\n105\n00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.650\n>> So different facilities require\ndifferent levels of security.\n\n106\n00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.550\n>> We see it's really secure places\nwhere you've got barriers outside to\n\n107\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.040\nprevent people from being able to\ndrive a vehicle up to the front of it.\n\n108\n00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.950\nWe talk about buildings that have cameras,\nguards, things like that.\n\n109\n00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.360\n[INAUDIBLE] Systems where we've had.\n\n110\n00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.510\n>> Maybe we'll get thumbprint scanners or\nRFID's at the doors and things like that.\n\n111\n00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.950\nThese are all things we can implement\nat the physical security level.\n\n112\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.390\n>> Yeah, those are some of the ones\nthat you do see is that yeah,\n\n113\n00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.630\nyou see systems that can do biometrics,\nyou can do scanning the cards and\n\n114\n00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.250\ndo all sorts of stuff like that with\ncameras and all that fancy stuff.\n\n115\n00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.660\nAnd then there are other things\nthat are outside of that.\n\n116\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.000\nThis is where you really got to\nhave specialized knowledge of it.\n\n117\n00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.930\nThe stuff that we are talking\nabout here is probably for\n\n118\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.270\nmost people that would view\nsomething like this or\n\n119\n00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.380\ngo through the cusp is something\nthat they don't have experience in.\n\n120\n00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.510\nThey're techies, they're managers,\nstuff like that.\n\n121\n00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.790\nThey have not dealt with any facilities\nstuff on the whole or construction or\n\n122\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.320\nanything like that so\n\n123\n00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.110\nyou may not be aware of things that\ndon't deal with stuff like locks.\n\n124\n00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.830\nLocks are the easy one, but\nwhat about the construction of that wall,\n\n125\n00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.060\nis that wall something that\nsomeone could just say well, hey,\n\n126\n00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.200\nhow cute you have a lock on that.\n\n127\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.470\nJust punch right through it.\n\n128\n00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.340\nIt's been done.\n\n129\n00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.920\nYou can punch through drywall pretty\neasily if you really wanna get into it.\n\n130\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.600\nAnd then you can,\nyou have situations where,\n\n131\n00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.130\nwhat if that wall is a false wall,\ndoesn't go all the way to the roof?\n\n132\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.950\nSomeone can just put a ladder to that and\ngo right over,\n\n133\n00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.140\nand do whatever they want at that point.\n\n134\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.650\nAnd keep in mind,\n\n135\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:33.507\nsomeone doesn't necessarily have\nto go in there to steal anything.\n\n136\n00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:37.385\nOne of the things I showed\nin the ethically hacking\n\n137\n00:07:37.385 --> 00:07:43.010\ncourse was I showed you a little\nDropbox you could put in place.\n\n138\n00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.710\nThat may be my whole adjective, to have\nsomething that's not that much bigger,\n\n139\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.760\nit's about the size,\nI guess of of a deck of cards.\n\n140\n00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.971\nJust go in there and plug it in,\nand leave it behind.\n\n141\n00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:58.234\nThose devices, I brought them in here for\n\n142\n00:07:58.234 --> 00:08:01.878\ndemo purposes to show\nyou what they look like.\n\n143\n00:08:01.878 --> 00:08:05.315\nAnd you know what I'm talking about,\nwhat they can do as well.\n\n144\n00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:09.498\nThose devices, in a good number of cases,\nare designed to be, believe it or not,\n\n145\n00:08:09.498 --> 00:08:13.960\nit's a $150 piece of equipment,\nthey're designed to be disposable.\n\n146\n00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.330\n>> No one can retrieve it.\n\n147\n00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.920\n>> Yeah, they basically expect, if you're\na pen tester, you're getting paid so\n\n148\n00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.260\nmuch for the job to break in to the thing.\n\n149\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.235\n>> That 150 bucks doesn't\nmean that much to you.\n\n150\n00:08:24.235 --> 00:08:28.720\nJust take it and plug it in,\npop it in there and done.\n\n151\n00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.740\nSo it can be a disposable asset.\n\n152\n00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.590\nYou know, more than likely,\nif you're doing a pen test and\n\n153\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.770\nyou're authorized to be there,\nyou're going to go get it.\n\n154\n00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.260\nBut, it's designed to be left behind\nif it had to, and not go retrieve it.\n\n155\n00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.560\nYou know so, you know keep in mind,\n\n156\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.120\nsomebody may be placing something in\nthere, you know that's really small and\n\n157\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:53.410\ninconspicuous and it's opening up\na back door, to them wherever they are.\n\n158\n00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.540\nYou know they could even have things like\nthose little boxes that they plug in,\n\n159\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.350\nto an outlet, and\nplug a network cable into.\n\n160\n00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.010\nThey have ones that open up\na wireless access points, and\n\n161\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.190\nthese things look legit.\n\n162\n00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:11.270\nThey actually have stickers that go on,\nmade them look like air fresheners and\n\n163\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.000\nstuff like that.\n\n164\n00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.190\nI mean, heck, if you have seen something\nlike the WiFi Pineapple that Hak5 makes,\n\n165\n00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.490\nthe WiFi Pineapple, they actually\nhave an enclosure that you can nick\n\n166\n00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.440\nthe motherboard out of the WiFi Pineapple\nwith the antennas and everything.\n\n167\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.820\nAnd shove it inside its enclosure,\n\n168\n00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.410\nseal it up, and\nit just looks like an air freshener.\n\n169\n00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.620\n>> All right.\n>> So it's got the lights and\n\n170\n00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.300\neverything else.\n\n171\n00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.330\nIt's got a test button and\neverything on it.\n\n172\n00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.970\nIt looks like it's supposed to be there.\n\n173\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:42.580\nBut meanwhile you could have\nan access point in there.\n\n174\n00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.170\nAct as a WiFi honeypot,\nplug a USB adapter in there,\n\n175\n00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.420\nwith your 3G, 4G stuff and say bye-bye.\n\n176\n00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.490\nAnd you've just broken into\nthat person's network or\n\n177\n00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.800\ncaptured information quite readily.\n\n178\n00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.510\n>> Now some of the things I think about\nwhen we talk about a secure layout on\n\n179\n00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.030\na building, I've always heard\nthe server closet, right?\n\n180\n00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:09.150\n>> If you have the choice we don't put\nthat on an exterior wall where somebody\n\n181\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.110\ncould maybe go through that or we've got\nwireless signals that might bleed out.\n\n182\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.620\nSo trying to put that in the center\nof the room helps with our layout or\n\n183\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.935\nthe center of the building I should say.\n\n184\n00:10:18.935 --> 00:10:21.880\n>> Yeah, you try to make it\nthat way wherever possible.\n\n185\n00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.950\nYou try to keep those assets\naway from external facing walls.\n\n186\n00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.560\nWhat you're trying to do, is its kind of\nlike a, you can look at it like an onion\n\n187\n00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.170\nor, you know the tootsie pop model\n>> Uh-hm.\n\n188\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.750\n>> I just came up with that.\n\n189\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.990\nYou just say you got the soft candy center\nand the center represents your assets.\n\n190\n00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.570\nAnd you have you know,\nstuff layered around it.\n\n191\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.340\nRemember, one of the things we\nhave security is defense in depth.\n\n192\n00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.390\nSo you've got the technology,\nthen you have the physical security and\n\n193\n00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:54.200\neven administrative policies\nto access that building that\n\n194\n00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.060\nsomeone has to go through all of these\nto get physical access to those assets.\n\n195\n00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.630\nAnd if it's against an outside wall,\nIt's not that tough,\n\n196\n00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.850\nI mean if they've got something\nthat's built as cinder blocks or\n\n197\n00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.400\nsomething like that,\nthat's a little tougher.\n\n198\n00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.210\nBut they could conceivably\nopen that wall up with enough\n\n199\n00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:19.150\neffort and get enough people turning\nthe other way, they could do that.\n\n200\n00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:23.590\nBut something that's a little\nmore insubstantial than that,\n\n201\n00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.020\nthen it's not going to\ntake much work at all.\n\n202\n00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.670\nI mean, heck you may be able to get a pair\n\n203\n00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.950\nof steel-toed boots with\nthat stuff in there.\n\n204\n00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.040\nBoom, one good kick,\nyou're right through it.\n\n205\n00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.670\n>> And then you got all your ways in and\nout of the facility.\n\n206\n00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.560\nDo we have all of those monitor guys see\nplaces where, you've got a front door, and\n\n207\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.630\non that front door there's a, an RFID\nscanner, and you've got cameras pointed\n\n208\n00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:50.630\nat it, nice lights out there, but then\nthey've got a side door that's used for\n\n209\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.600\ndeliveries, and\nthey don't take deliveries anymore, and\n\n210\n00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.030\nit's got 6 foot bushes next to it that\nsomeone could easily hide behind.\n\n211\n00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.450\n>> There's no lighting over there,\nit's got some crappy lock on it.\n\n212\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.650\nThose are the kind of things we can\nthink about when we're designing\n\n213\n00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.950\na secure building.\n\n214\n00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.570\n>> Yeah there's so\nmany factors that go into it,\n\n215\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.800\nand it's not just the manmade ones,\nit's the environmental ones too.\n\n216\n00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.640\nYou've got the environmental ones\nthat happen in the form of fires,\n\n217\n00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.970\nfloods, mudslides, earthquakes, tornadoes.\n\n218\n00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.660\nWe have most of those in California.\n\n219\n00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.850\n>> So you've got them all over.\n\n220\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.420\n>> Yeah.\nyeah, we've got all those.\n\n221\n00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.830\nEven the tornadoes, so we're prepared.\n\n222\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.200\nArmageddon ain't got nothing on us.\n\n223\n00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:38.680\nSo you can have all of, you can have\nstuff naturally in the environment.\n\n224\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.610\nYou know,\nI wasn't joking when I said wildlife.\n\n225\n00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:46.450\nWildlife has caused problems\nin the past where things have,\n\n226\n00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:51.610\nbirds have set up nests in stuff,\nthings like dishes and stuff like that.\n\n227\n00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.180\nYou've gotten mice, field mice have\nyou know, come in sometimes and\n\n228\n00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.000\nespecially if you have something near by\ndoing construction on a big open field.\n\n229\n00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.870\nThey build something new those\nmice gotta go somewhere.\n\n230\n00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.190\nSo you have to think about those things.\n\n231\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.980\nAnd then there's even stuff like the fire\ncontrol systems and suppression systems,\n\n232\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:15.150\ndetection systems, all that comes in so\nthere's a lot that can go in here.\n\n233\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.640\nSo it shows you when you look\nat this that It's probably not\n\n234\n00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.590\nsomething that you're gonna have\na really good amount of knowledge on.\n\n235\n00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.630\nYou need to understand that\nthere's a need for this.\n\n236\n00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.940\nBut you're probably gonna\nhave to outsource it or\n\n237\n00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.530\nwork with a facilities\nmanager if you've got one.\n\n238\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.380\nAnd if you're in a large\ncompany you probably do.\n\n239\n00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:40.470\nAnd talk to them about what we've got and\nme being able to bring in an architect and\n\n240\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.980\nso on and so\nforth that can help you reinforce this and\n\n241\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.810\ndo what they need to to bring\nthat up to a specific level.\n\n242\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:49.780\nAnd you determine what that level is.\n\n243\n00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.400\nAnd then there's even\nstuff around the building,\n\n244\n00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.120\nlike you were mentioning bushes and\nstuff like that.\n\n245\n00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.810\nGetting those things,\nmake sure they're trimmed back, and\n\n246\n00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:03.130\nthere's not a way they can approach\nthis facility without being seen.\n\n247\n00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:09.620\nThere's just so many different levels\nto this that it's very tough for\n\n248\n00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.100\nsomeone to really be\na specialist in this and IT.\n\n249\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.934\nIt happens,\nI've had people like that you know,\n\n250\n00:14:17.934 --> 00:14:22.681\nI want to train guys in the military\nthat are security forces or\n\n251\n00:14:22.681 --> 00:14:27.521\nmps something they've done they say,\noh don't do anymore and\n\n252\n00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:32.178\ncrosstrain over into div had Into one of,\ncommunications or\n\n253\n00:14:32.178 --> 00:14:34.410\nIT fields and that happens.\n\n254\n00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.250\nThey're still not specialists and\neverything, but they know a heck of a lot\n\n255\n00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.720\nmore than a regular guys going to know,\nso do be aware of that.\n\n256\n00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.610\nIs that there is a definite need for\nthe physical side of things,\n\n257\n00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.500\nbut you're gonna have to really explore\nall those things and you need to make sure\n\n258\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:54.410\npeople can't ultimately get physical\naccess to things like cables,\n\n259\n00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.230\nand infrastructure, computers,\nanything like that.\n\n260\n00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.920\nThey can't get in or out without being\nmonitored, or being outright stopped.\n\n261\n00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.400\n>> Man traps are another thing I was\nthinking of there when you said that.\n\n262\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.650\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> Make sure somebody's stopped,\n\n263\n00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.470\nor a great way to control who's\nallowed to come through, or\n\n264\n00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.860\ncome into the building itself.\n\n265\n00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.270\nOr just maybe more secure part.\n\n266\n00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.330\nThat's one of the things you mentioned\nearlier, layers of security.\n\n267\n00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.680\nLike here,\nwe're not a super secure facility,\n\n268\n00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.320\nbut we have got some things\nthat need to be secured.\n\n269\n00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.150\nAnd most of my employees can get into\nthe front door of the building but\n\n270\n00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.208\nvery few of them can open up the server\ncloset and get into that area, right.\n\n271\n00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:31.370\nSo their RFID tag is limited\non what they are allowed\n\n272\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.790\nto access physically to control that.\n\n273\n00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:38.340\nMade me think of too, we were talking\nabout scatter earlier in an episode and\n\n274\n00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.460\nI do some work with progressive\nenergy here in Florida,\n\n275\n00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.360\nthey control some nuclear power plants.\n\n276\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.130\nOne of my first experiences in\na facility where you walk in and\n\n277\n00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:50.120\nyou tell the gentleman\nwho you are there to see.\n\n278\n00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.157\nHe tells you,\nthere are 3 elevators over there.\n\n279\n00:15:53.157 --> 00:15:56.118\nHe tells you what elevator\nyou are going to get on.\n\n280\n00:15:56.118 --> 00:15:59.415\nI walk over there to elevator number 2,\nand sure enough the door opens up.\n\n281\n00:15:59.415 --> 00:16:01.796\nI get in,\nthere's no buttons inside the elevator.\n\n282\n00:16:01.796 --> 00:16:04.986\nThe person at the front desk has already\nprogrammed this elevator to go to\n\n283\n00:16:04.986 --> 00:16:05.990\nthe floor that I need.\n\n284\n00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:09.310\nAnd when I get off of that elevator,\nI'm in a glass vestibule and\n\n285\n00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.490\nI'm not getting either\nback into the elevator or\n\n286\n00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:16.360\nonto the floor until somebody form\nthe inside comes and opens that door.\n\n287\n00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.290\nAnd, so, that's the kind of\nthing we're talking about.\n\n288\n00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.990\nWe're talking about physical security.\n\n289\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:24.810\nObviously they've got a much higher\nneed because they've got access to\n\n290\n00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:26.450\nnuclear power plants.\n\n291\n00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.909\nIt really depends on what\nlevel of security you need.\n\n292\n00:16:28.909 --> 00:16:31.886\n>> Someone there is stroking a cat or\nsomething in there.\n\n293\n00:16:31.886 --> 00:16:34.370\n[LAUGH] I've seen that movie,\nI know how it ends.\n\n294\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:39.067\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n295\n00:16:39.067 --> 00:16:40.871\nphysical security is one of those things.\n\n296\n00:16:40.871 --> 00:16:45.971\nIn IT we tend to forget those sides of\nthings, as you say, we're busy dealing\n\n297\n00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:51.080\nwith the cool stuff, the geeky stuff,\nthe technology and things like that.\n\n298\n00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.510\nBut, physical security\nis a huge part of it.\n\n299\n00:16:54.510 --> 00:17:00.100\nBecause, once you get physical access it's\nreally almost impossible to stop somebody.\n\n300\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.153\n>> Yeah,\nit becomes a much tougher proposition.\n\n301\n00:17:03.153 --> 00:17:08.673\nSo you definitely want to cut that off\nat the source as much as possible so\n\n302\n00:17:08.673 --> 00:17:14.194\nthey can't get in and start being touchy,\nfeely with everything and.\n\n303\n00:17:14.194 --> 00:17:17.267\nIt's something that you not\nonly have to account for, but\n\n304\n00:17:17.267 --> 00:17:22.410\nit's also something that I'd say isn't\naudited enough and tested enough, even.\n\n305\n00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.960\nIt's stuff that you would\nexpect would be common sense,\n\n306\n00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.510\nis not as common sense as\nyou would think it is.\n\n307\n00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:35.930\nI've visited places where I just\nwalk in as far as I want and\n\n308\n00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:39.700\nwalk right back out and\nno one would question anything.\n\n309\n00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:44.200\nI did a test once where I,\ntalk about something that you're\n\n310\n00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.980\nreally kind of thinking what can I do\nto really catch someone's attention.\n\n311\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:52.430\nGrabbed a couple computers I mean I\ntook a couple computers in my arms and\n\n312\n00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:53.850\nI'm just like walking out.\n\n313\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.574\nThe guard came out from his desk and\n\n314\n00:17:55.574 --> 00:17:57.964\nI'm like okay well I think\nI got his attention.\n\n315\n00:17:57.964 --> 00:18:01.310\nAnd he held the door open for\nme to walk out to my car.\n\n316\n00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.080\nI loaded them in.\n\n317\n00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.399\nHe actually asked me,\nyou gonna be able to get those in your.\n\n318\n00:18:04.399 --> 00:18:06.349\nI'm like yeah, yeah, I got it.\n\n319\n00:18:06.349 --> 00:18:08.559\nJust stole a couple employees' computers.\n\n320\n00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:11.415\nThey're lucky I gave them back, or did I?\n\n321\n00:18:11.415 --> 00:18:12.335\nYou guys don't know.\n\n322\n00:18:12.335 --> 00:18:15.725\nSo it was that simple.\n\n323\n00:18:15.725 --> 00:18:19.040\nThe dude's a security guard,\nand he was being Mr.\n\n324\n00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.800\nHelpful, and hey,\nthat's all well and good, but\n\n325\n00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.800\nshouldn't there be some question about\nhey, you supposed to have those?\n\n326\n00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.700\n>> Yeah, and that's where management and\ntraining the employees, and teaching them,\n\n327\n00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.820\nwe've talked about this kinda\nthing in several different shows,\n\n328\n00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.822\nbut that human nature,\nwe like to help people.\n\n329\n00:18:38.822 --> 00:18:41.400\nWe wanna be liked and\nopening the door for somebody.\n\n330\n00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.160\nThat's the polite thing to do, right?\n\n331\n00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.959\nBut that's not the secure thing to do.\n\n332\n00:18:44.959 --> 00:18:46.724\n>> Tailgating, she keep coming back in.\n\n333\n00:18:46.724 --> 00:18:48.366\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I so one do that, that night.\n\n334\n00:18:48.366 --> 00:18:52.952\nI was gonna get one of those wheel chairs\nand start stacking monitors and stuff.\n\n335\n00:18:52.952 --> 00:18:54.831\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just wheel it out.\n\n336\n00:18:54.831 --> 00:19:00.539\n>> I didn't do it cuz I\nwasn't able to stop laughing.\n\n337\n00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:01.572\nWhat's so funny man?\n\n338\n00:19:01.572 --> 00:19:02.697\nYou'll find out.\n\n339\n00:19:02.697 --> 00:19:06.390\n[LAUGH]\n>> So it is something that we've gotta\n\n340\n00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.374\nthink about when it comes\nto securing our facilities.\n\n341\n00:19:09.374 --> 00:19:14.489\nA lot of times, like I said we bought\nthe building maybe the building\n\n342\n00:19:14.489 --> 00:19:18.727\nwasn't being that wasn't used for\nthe same purposes.\n\n343\n00:19:18.727 --> 00:19:20.100\nA lot of times you repurpose things.\n\n344\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.800\nI know I've talked about when it comes to\nphysical security, re-purposing a room.\n\n345\n00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.130\nWhere I've had a situation\nwhere it was a cubical farm.\n\n346\n00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.840\nSo there are ports all along the wall for\ndozens of computers and cubicals and\n\n347\n00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.870\nthings like that.\n\n348\n00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:39.430\nAnd now it's turned into a break area,\nor something like that,\n\n349\n00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.270\nthat's not so secure, but\nthe ports are still in the wall.\n\n350\n00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.690\nAnd somebody could walk in there and\nplug in a computer to that port, and\n\n351\n00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:46.710\nnobody would say anything to them.\n\n352\n00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:50.090\nThey could sit there unmonitored,\nand so did we shut those ports down?\n\n353\n00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.750\nDid we snip those cables so\n\n354\n00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.940\nthat they can't possibly\nconnect back to our network?\n\n355\n00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.610\n>> Stuff can get lost in the shuffle.\n\n356\n00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.130\nYou just never really know.\n\n357\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.310\nIt's that does indeed happen.\n\n358\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.290\nBeen in places where yeah, the ports have\nbeen left open, the modems have been left\n\n359\n00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.890\non, phone lines have been turned on,\npeople just plug modems in and\n\n360\n00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:13.470\nbypass security on the network, there's\nthings can fall through the cracks.\n\n361\n00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.530\nThat's why having good accountability and\n\n362\n00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.672\nreally keeping track of\nall the stuff s essential.\n\n363\n00:20:19.672 --> 00:20:21.560\nIt's gonna keep you out\nof a lot of trouble.\n\n364\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.150\nNot all of it but you know,\nwhy make more trouble than you need to?\n\n365\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:29.620\nKeep track of these things, and\ndon't let someone find something.\n\n366\n00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.180\nFind out a security problem because.\n\n367\n00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:37.170\nThey see an extra line item on a bill,\nor something like that.\n\n368\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.450\nThen that's happened,\n\n369\n00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:44.860\nthere's been cases where someone wasn't\ntotally a physical security issue.\n\n370\n00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:50.040\nThere was a famous story where\nsomeone found a breach that\n\n371\n00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.070\nwas going all the way back to Germany and\ninvolved a bunch of stuff.\n\n372\n00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:58.558\nThey found it because there was an extra\nthree cent charge on their phone bill.\n\n373\n00:20:58.558 --> 00:21:03.978\nBut someone checked it and was able\nto keep peeling back these layers and\n\n374\n00:21:03.978 --> 00:21:06.430\nit opened up to this huge thing.\n\n375\n00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.169\nSo, you should really be\nkeeping track of this.\n\n376\n00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:13.697\nYou may not find something like that,\nbut you may very well find something.\n\n377\n00:21:13.697 --> 00:21:17.874\nI've heard of janitors finding things,\nand that's not to say, oh, well,\n\n378\n00:21:17.874 --> 00:21:19.108\nit's just a janitor.\n\n379\n00:21:19.108 --> 00:21:23.503\nI was told by a colleague of mine\nthat he had a janitor ask him\n\n380\n00:21:23.503 --> 00:21:25.477\na question about a green,\n\n381\n00:21:25.477 --> 00:21:31.432\nblinking light in the storage closet\nwhere he kept all his cleaning supplies.\n\n382\n00:21:31.432 --> 00:21:34.539\nI was yeah, I know about technology,\nthat's what the janitor asked him,\n\n383\n00:21:34.539 --> 00:21:37.696\nhe approached the janitor said anything\nyou think you can help, anything,\n\n384\n00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:40.704\nsuggestions to improve security, or\nanything that might be a problem,\n\n385\n00:21:40.704 --> 00:21:42.900\nthe guy said, nah,\nI don't really deal with that.\n\n386\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.554\nSays but you're an IT guy, and you know\nall that technology stuff, and everything,\n\n387\n00:21:46.554 --> 00:21:50.560\nmaybe you can answer a question for me,\nhe says, I been really curious about it.\n\n388\n00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.200\nAnd took him to this closet where\nthis green, blinking light was.\n\n389\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.920\nIt was a modem someone had plugged in and\n\n390\n00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.720\nhad a backdoor, potentially,\ninto the network.\n\n391\n00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.925\nAnd this guy had been there, he says but\nno one asked them any questions\n\n392\n00:22:06.935 --> 00:22:10.975\nabout anything like this, and\nwhen he brought it up, they said, yeah,\n\n393\n00:22:10.975 --> 00:22:15.105\noh yeah, just probably something\nthat maintenance or whatever put in.\n\n394\n00:22:15.105 --> 00:22:16.165\nNo one went to go look.\n\n395\n00:22:16.165 --> 00:22:19.270\nMy friend went in,\nsaid yeah, that's a modem.\n\n396\n00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.473\nThat shouldn't be there.\n\n397\n00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:21.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n398\n00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:24.550\nyou never know who has this\ninformation and who can help you.\n\n399\n00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.110\n>> Yeah, absolutely, so.\n\n400\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:30.980\nSecuring the facility is a important part\nof securing our network, whether we're in\n\n401\n00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.190\nthere from the ground up and building it\nand designing and laying out the building.\n\n402\n00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.142\nFor our purposes, or\nwe're re-purposing something.\n\n403\n00:22:38.142 --> 00:22:42.399\nWe've got to have a good grasp of what\nwe have available, what options we have\n\n404\n00:22:42.399 --> 00:22:46.786\navailable to keep the facility secure and\nhow we can implement them properly and\n\n405\n00:22:46.786 --> 00:22:50.471\ntrain our employees because we know\nthe human is the weakest link.\n\n406\n00:22:50.471 --> 00:22:54.539\nAnd we can do all we can to secure our\nfacilities and it just takes one person\n\n407\n00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:58.603\npropping that back door open or letting\nsomeone else tailgate in on them or\n\n408\n00:22:58.603 --> 00:23:01.639\nholding the door for\nSean as he carries out computers.\n\n409\n00:23:01.639 --> 00:23:02.244\nSo.\n\n410\n00:23:02.244 --> 00:23:04.128\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know how it is.\n\n411\n00:23:04.128 --> 00:23:07.926\nI remember seeing this\nbumper sticker years ago.\n\n412\n00:23:07.926 --> 00:23:12.353\nWhen you think about human\nbeings in the system.\n\n413\n00:23:12.353 --> 00:23:17.500\nYour well laid plans go\nto just to heck and back.\n\n414\n00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.232\nI remember seeing this\nbumper sticker years ago,\n\n415\n00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:23.680\nit says it takes several thousand\nbolts to hold a car together,\n\n416\n00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.296\nit takes one nut to scatter\nit all over the road.\n\n417\n00:23:26.296 --> 00:23:26.942\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n418\n00:23:26.942 --> 00:23:29.400\nthat's what I kinda think\nabout human beings sometimes.\n\n419\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.275\nSo if I could just get rid of that part,\nmost secure system ever.\n\n420\n00:23:33.275 --> 00:23:35.436\n[LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n421\n00:23:35.436 --> 00:23:38.449\nAll right, well Sean, a lot of good\ninformation there about securing our\n\n422\n00:23:38.449 --> 00:23:42.290\nfacilities anything else we need to\ntalk about before we wrap this one up?\n\n423\n00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:47.450\n>> I think we're doing pretty good on that\none, they've got the fundamentals with\n\n424\n00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.980\nphysical security and what it means, and\nit's up to you guys to take it from there.\n\n425\n00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.437\n>> Very good.\nAll right, well,\n\n426\n00:23:53.437 --> 00:23:57.762\nwrapping up another episode here of\nITProTV signing off I'm Mike Rodrick and\n\n427\n00:23:57.762 --> 00:24:00.372\nI'm Sean Oriyano and\nwe'll see

00:00:15.840\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.870\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.190\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.280\n>> I cannot complain.\n\n7\n00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.740\nI'm here doing another episode of our\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner and\n\n8\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.640\nin this episode today Sean,\n\n9\n00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.860\nwe're going to talk about some good old\nsecure network infrastructure design.\n\n10\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.230\nWell there's a mouthful for us.\n\n11\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.540\nWhen it comes to our network\ninfrastructure, things like routers,\n\n12\n00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.980\nswitches, all those interconnecting\ndevices, it's got to be set up properly.\n\n13\n00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.960\n>> Indeed it does.\n\n14\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.670\nThere are plenty of complexities here\ntherefore plenty of room for error.\n\n15\n00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.000\nYou've really got to get this right and\nreally think it out and\n\n16\n00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.650\nplan ahead of time before\nyou go to implement.\n\n17\n00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.390\nAnd so what we're going do here is\nwe're going to talk about really,\n\n18\n00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.370\nwe got a couple devices\nthat we can focus on.\n\n19\n00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.380\nWe can look at switches,\nand we can look at routers.\n\n20\n00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.640\nBoth of those ones tend to\nbe some of the bigger ones.\n\n21\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.180\nI know we're missing a whole bunch of\nother ones, like that's the only one?\n\n22\n00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.370\nYeah, I'm missing the brick\nwall we build around stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.760\nStuff like firewalls and IDSes and\nall that, the reason why I'm not including\n\n24\n00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.730\nthat in this is that I'm well aware\nthat those are security devices.\n\n25\n00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.300\nThose are just something that's going to\nbe discussed a little more fully later and\n\n26\n00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.140\nthere's some other stuff that\nwe can talk about with them\n\n27\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.350\nthat kind of merits its own section.\n\n28\n00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.620\nSo don't freak out and think I have\nhad a fit or something like that.\n\n29\n00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.940\n>> I thought you were going to\nleave out moats altogether and\n\n30\n00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.910\nI got my alligator standing\nby to fill this thing up.\n\n31\n00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.627\n>> All of Florida technically would be\na moat, then, if it's got alligators.\n\n32\n00:01:48.627 --> 00:01:50.760\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So where do we start?\n\n33\n00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.830\nRouters in a big part of our\nnetwork design, obviously for\n\n34\n00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.900\nconnecting our different sub-nets or\nconnecting us to the outside world, and\n\n35\n00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.120\na lot of configuration has\nto be done on those, right?\n\n36\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.010\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n37\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.590\nI mean both these devices are going\nto require a lot of stuff.\n\n38\n00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.480\nA switch has a lot of\nstuff that goes on and\n\n39\n00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.070\nthe router definitely has a lot\nof stuff that goes on with it.\n\n40\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.340\nAnd that's probably,\nif you're going to make a mistake, and\n\n41\n00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.280\nthat's probably one of the leading areas\nwhere you're going to make a mistake,\n\n42\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.280\nespecially if you're brand new to it.\n\n43\n00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.830\nFortunately, the mistakes that we had in\nthe past with routers that were common,\n\n44\n00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.290\na lot of those have already been made and\npeople start planning ahead and\n\n45\n00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.250\nreally kind of thinking stuff out, and\n\n46\n00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.620\nthere's been a lot of brain power\ndedicated towards getting it right.\n\n47\n00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.590\nSo as far as it's something that\nyou can hack and penetrate, yeah,\n\n48\n00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.460\nyou can still do that.\n\n49\n00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.950\nWe're not, as pen testers,\ncompletely out of the picture on that.\n\n50\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.950\nIt just means it's going to\nbe a little more difficult if\n\n51\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.740\npeople are actually\nfollowing the rules and\n\n52\n00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.410\nthought things through, and we're going\nto have to take a little more time on it.\n\n53\n00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.720\nFortunately, or unfortunately\ndepending on how you look at it,\n\n54\n00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.820\nthere is plenty of tools and scripts,\n\n55\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.270\nthings that have been written to help you,\nas a pen tester, extract that information.\n\n56\n00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.200\nSo that's kind of the other\nside of the picture,\n\n57\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.040\nbut I guess really kind of talk about it.\n\n58\n00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.460\nWe look at problems that happened with\nrouters as far as configuration goes.\n\n59\n00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.910\nA lot of it is people jumping in and\n\n60\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.920\nnot thinking about what they're going to\nset up and just going with the basics.\n\n61\n00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.010\nThey think they've got it and they set\nup a rule set and then all of a sudden\n\n62\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.900\nthey think it's fine, all of a sudden\nsomething starts slipping through and\n\n63\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.110\nthey now get their second education\nin the school of hard knocks.\n\n64\n00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.370\nI mean and you've seen them right?\n\n65\n00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.600\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> You've seen\n\n66\n00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.790\nthese sorts of things happen for\na long time.\n\n67\n00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.470\n>> I'm a Windows guy and I know I've\ntried to configure a router and\n\n68\n00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.940\nI got my rules in the wrong order, and\nall of a sudden no traffic could make\n\n69\n00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.810\nit through,\ntraffic that I wanted to allow in.\n\n70\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.046\nVery easy to do, so\nwe gotta make sure we've got our rules.\n\n71\n00:04:01.046 --> 00:04:02.537\n>> Well, technically that's\nthe most secure you can make it.\n\n72\n00:04:02.537 --> 00:04:03.175\n>> It was secure.\n\n73\n00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:07.880\n[LAUGH] Remember, accessibility is\na part of our, so you try that, right,\n\n74\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.255\nyou've got to make sure there's\nmore availability, I should say.\n\n75\n00:04:12.255 --> 00:04:13.080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you've got to\n\n76\n00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.990\nmake sure those resources\nare available to be used.\n\n77\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.440\nThat's what I see, is misconfigured rules,\nrules in the wrong order,\n\n78\n00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.325\nnot looking for private IP addresses\ncoming form the outside, things like that,\n\n79\n00:04:26.325 --> 00:04:27.910\na lot of common mistakes.\n\n80\n00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.390\n>> Yeah, and they've done a lot to really\nhelp you over the years on this, but\n\n81\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.660\nyou still get situations where people\njust jump right in with both feet,\n\n82\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.890\nand I'm all for that.\n\n83\n00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.030\nIf you're going to commit to\nactually doing it, you should do it.\n\n84\n00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.740\nThe thing is is that you\nreally can't get a lot\n\n85\n00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.452\nof what you need just from sitting there\nand reading books and stuff like that.\n\n86\n00:04:51.452 --> 00:04:54.900\nYou can get a good amount of\ninformation there, but a lot of it also\n\n87\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.520\ncomes with experience and some people\njust aren't willing to do that.\n\n88\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.030\nThey read the book, and like, okay,\nI'm good, and they go out and\n\n89\n00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.680\njust start doing, and that doesn't give\nthem all the tools they need to really\n\n90\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.020\nthink about this and plan it correctly.\n\n91\n00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.810\nAnd even if you have the experience,\nyou're going to make mistakes,\n\n92\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.050\nthat's part of the game, but\nthat's where the automated tools,\n\n93\n00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.120\nand that's where a pen\ntester comes in as well,\n\n94\n00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.080\nis to help find those things and\nsay yeah, well there's some things here.\n\n95\n00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.570\nThen you learn from it and\nwe don't do it again.\n\n96\n00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.240\nBut its it's definitely\nnot an easy thing to do.\n\n97\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.600\nI mean heck, that's why you see in a lot\npf places, you see the the software guys\n\n98\n00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.250\nand the infrastructure guys that they\njust focus on all the stuff that\n\n99\n00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.700\nties things together because they're\njust so much to do there and\n\n100\n00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.570\nso much potential for things to be just,\nquite frankly, messed up.\n\n101\n00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.050\nSo yeah, your experience is not unusual.\n\n102\n00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.360\nI'm sure there's a number of people\nout there who've had the same issue,\n\n103\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.020\nand that's why they push it a lot\nin different security guidances,\n\n104\n00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.000\nand that's why they push it for\npen testers too.\n\n105\n00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.970\nTo say this is something\nthat you should look at and\n\n106\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.540\nreally pay extra attention to and if\nthis isn't something that is your thing,\n\n107\n00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.440\nthen you need to get somebody that\nthat is their thing to help you out.\n\n108\n00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.130\nSo I was talking in\nthe ethical hacking course,\n\n109\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.203\nI was talking about the fact that\nyou get individuals that quite\n\n110\n00:06:21.203 --> 00:06:26.608\nliterally will get the book,\nlike the book on the CCNA.\n\n111\n00:06:26.608 --> 00:06:31.620\nI'm not bashing that credential,\nit actually is a very good credential.\n\n112\n00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.410\nBut you're not going to tell me that\nyou're going to get the book and\n\n113\n00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.070\nread through that and\ngo grab a piece of paper and\n\n114\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.020\nall of a sudden magically\nyou're the expert on it.\n\n115\n00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.720\nYou haven't had that seasoning and\nstuff that takes place when\n\n116\n00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.960\nyou are out in the field and\nworking with someone that's done it.\n\n117\n00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.690\nSome people do go the extra mile,\nthey'll go up to eBay or\n\n118\n00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.630\npurchase one of these software\nsimulators that helps them\n\n119\n00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.410\nlearn how to configure a router, and hey\nmore power to you if you're doing that.\n\n120\n00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.390\nThat's taking the initiative and\ngoing one more step on it.\n\n121\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.650\nBut still, there's still some\nthings that you're not going to, or\n\n122\n00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.840\na lot of things that you're not going\nto encounter in those simulators,\n\n123\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.370\nand by playing around with\nthose things on your own\n\n124\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.200\nthat you need to get in the real\nworld through experience.\n\n125\n00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.070\nSo it's that lack of experience that,\n\n126\n00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.646\nit's someone like a pen tester or a black\nhat is going to count on to get in.\n\n127\n00:07:24.646 --> 00:07:29.710\nYou've really got to use\neverything at your fingertips and\n\n128\n00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.620\neverything you can to really\nmake sure you get this right.\n\n129\n00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.671\nAnd if you don't know it,\nyou don't know it.\n\n130\n00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:36.880\nBut-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n131\n00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.820\n>> Not saying no one does it,\n\n132\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.400\nnot saying you do.\n\n133\n00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.380\nJust saying, be aware of it.\n\n134\n00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.845\nKnow your limitations.\n\n135\n00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:47.575\nBut anyway, you were talking\nabout your experience with it,\n\n136\n00:07:47.575 --> 00:07:51.553\ndid you keep messing with them after that?\n\n137\n00:07:51.553 --> 00:07:52.087\nYou were like, this isn't for me.\n\n138\n00:07:52.087 --> 00:07:55.016\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] No, I never have done the full\n\n139\n00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:58.889\nCisco route, but I still play with them,\nlike you were saying,\n\n140\n00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:02.850\nI play with the simulators primarily and\nwork with them that way.\n\n141\n00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.210\n>> It can be a frustrating experience\nThe first time I got into,\n\n142\n00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.648\nlike I don't need to do this really.\n\n143\n00:08:10.648 --> 00:08:15.470\n>> [LAUGH] All right, but the big one\nwas least specific to most specific on\n\n144\n00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.570\nyour rules is one of the keys\nthat you have to remember there,\n\n145\n00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.997\nbut I'm definitely not the expert\nwhen it comes to routers.\n\n146\n00:08:22.997 --> 00:08:26.100\n[LAUGH]\n>> For me the availability portion\n\n147\n00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.640\nwas making sure I had someone available\nthat knew how to do this stuff so\n\n148\n00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.190\nI didn't have to.\n\n149\n00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.330\nBut anyway talking about what we can do to\n\n150\n00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:42.360\nhelp the issue out and make things\nwork a little better, we can go and\n\n151\n00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.036\nI'll do some poking around here with Kali.\n\n152\n00:08:46.036 --> 00:08:51.246\nKali is something that we talked about\nin another course, so if you want\n\n153\n00:08:51.246 --> 00:08:56.540\nto get the whole experience with it, you\ndefinitely want to go and revisit that.\n\n154\n00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.470\nIt's a great course.\n\n155\n00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.920\nThe two of us, we don't make bad courses.\n\n156\n00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.076\nSo it's a great exploration\nof that technology, but\n\n157\n00:09:05.076 --> 00:09:09.230\nwhat we're going to do here is I'm\njust going to show you just briefly\n\n158\n00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.630\nsince I'm not going to actively put a poke\nat a router here, I do want to show you,\n\n159\n00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:19.390\nthough, what I've got up on my screen\nhere is I have the Kali environment.\n\n160\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:25.440\nThe Kali environment, like we said before,\nit's Linux and all that good stuff.\n\n161\n00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.180\nThis is just to, and let me close this\nwindow just to show you before I go into\n\n162\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:35.490\nsome of those things,\nlet me show you the tool set that it has.\n\n163\n00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.089\nSo you have this Kali Linux menu\nin here and we've got bunches and\n\n164\n00:09:40.089 --> 00:09:43.411\nbunches and\nbunches of tools inside of this and\n\n165\n00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:49.033\njust because it has a section in here\nlike you see on these exploitation tools,\n\n166\n00:09:49.033 --> 00:09:54.683\nit has a bunch of Cisco based attacks,\nthat's not the only place it puts them.\n\n167\n00:09:54.683 --> 00:09:59.487\nAnd there's actually other tools that\nare not specifically labeled for\n\n168\n00:09:59.487 --> 00:10:02.510\nrouters that can help\nyou do that analyses.\n\n169\n00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:07.850\nI, for example, wouldn't put something\nlike Endmap out of the picture.\n\n170\n00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:13.870\nEndmap is not called out as specifically\nbeing a tool that is going to analyze\n\n171\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.580\nrouters, but you could definitely use it\nto get some initial information on it and\n\n172\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.520\nmaybe you can get all you want on it.\n\n173\n00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.840\nWe have packet crafters and\npacket forgers that would help you out.\n\n174\n00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.581\nPlus there's plenty of other tools\ninside of Kali that can help you out.\n\n175\n00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:32.449\nI just want to draw your\nattention to the fact that, yeah,\n\n176\n00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:34.970\nwe've got tools in here\nspecifically tailored for\n\n177\n00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.340\nthe big boys as far as routing and\nswitching all that goes.\n\n178\n00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.638\nWe have these tools that you can,\nthis one,\n\n179\n00:10:41.638 --> 00:10:46.273\nthis was the one I had initially\nwhen I came in here, this one,\n\n180\n00:10:46.273 --> 00:10:51.175\nif I had a router accessible to me,\nI could just use this to point at\n\n181\n00:10:51.175 --> 00:10:55.660\nthe router and you could see\nthe stuff it will pull out of it.\n\n182\n00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.570\nYou could see SNMP stuff it will pull out.\n\n183\n00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:03.470\nIt can look for or try to guess a password\noff of this and see if it can grab it.\n\n184\n00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:08.040\nSo if you haven't changed your password or\nused something that is just a word out of\n\n185\n00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.510\na dictionary which quite\nfrankly that's not unheard of.\n\n186\n00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:18.050\nIt should be something that's a lot less\nheard of but unfortunately it's not.\n\n187\n00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:23.360\nI threw out one of our previous\nepisodes in this series.\n\n188\n00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.430\nI was talking about how those machines for\nswiping credit cards at restaurants and\n\n189\n00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.940\nstuff like that, that they don't\nchange those passwords a lot of times.\n\n190\n00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.380\nThey get them from the vendor and just\nlike, here you go and set it there and\n\n191\n00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.850\nlike, it works, look,\nI can swipe credit cards through it.\n\n192\n00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.590\nIt's like yeah, imagine that,\nI'll pick it up from here.\n\n193\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.800\nThat's what you basically have,\n\n194\n00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.850\nis you have something that\nthey haven't changed any.\n\n195\n00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.810\nThis is the type of thing that can happen\nhere too is that someone plugs a device in\n\n196\n00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:53.990\nand they get it all configured and after\ngoing through all those complexities,\n\n197\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:58.570\nthey're just, I don't have to worry\nabout doing any of this other stuff.\n\n198\n00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.910\nI've seen it happen.\n\n199\n00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:05.560\nHeck, one of the worst ones I'd\nseen talking about passwords is,\n\n200\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.060\nI knew an individual that was really,\nreally, really good at this stuff.\n\n201\n00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.630\nHe still is too.\n\n202\n00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:15.340\nThis guy never has to look at a manual,\nor anything else like that.\n\n203\n00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.389\nThis guy just has\nan inherent ability on it.\n\n204\n00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:22.740\nI was talking to him one time and\nhe said, Just to make things easier,\n\n205\n00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.850\nI don't set any passwords.\n\n206\n00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.495\nOh, my head just hurt\nreally bad at that point.\n\n207\n00:12:27.495 --> 00:12:28.530\n>> {LAUGHS}\n>> I mean,\n\n208\n00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:34.490\nhe had his own justification for it, but\nit was, when he was setting stuff up,\n\n209\n00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.470\nhe said just to make it easy on himself,\nhe didn't set any passwords up.\n\n210\n00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.770\nHe said he would set them up later.\n\n211\n00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.920\nCan you imagine on some of these places\nwhere you have racks and racks and\n\n212\n00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.000\nracks of these things?\n\n213\n00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.690\nI don't care how good your memory is,\n\n214\n00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.870\nthere's a good chance of you missing one,\nand that's all I need.\n\n215\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:55.740\nI need just one spot to get in through and\nthat's it.\n\n216\n00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.510\nIt's over for you.\n\n217\n00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.740\nBut anyway, to look at this\n>> We'll have to get on Nate about\n\n218\n00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.240\nthat and\nmake sure he sets those passwords.\n\n219\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.150\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n220\n00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:10.720\nSo you can see quite a bit with this tool.\n\n221\n00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.180\nIt's like I said, specifically designed\nto go after Cisco devices and there's,\n\n222\n00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.960\nlike I said, plenty of other ones in here\nthat do the same thing that can allow you\n\n223\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.050\nto go in, and then you have this one, your\nsigning in that also plays another role in\n\n224\n00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.650\nactually breaking and punching into\nrouters, and that's more of a generic one,\n\n225\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:32.640\nso if you don't have Cisco stuff that\ncould go in and do stuff for you, too.\n\n226\n00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.650\nThere's all sorts of\ntools in here to help you\n\n227\n00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.820\nto audit routers and check routers out.\n\n228\n00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:47.115\nAnd like I said, if you don't have\na Cisco one or if you just want\n\n229\n00:13:47.115 --> 00:13:51.770\nto go another route,\nyou do have things like these information\n\n230\n00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:56.510\ngathering tools built into a system\nlike Kali, that can help you do things.\n\n231\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:02.980\nHere we have stuff on here, there's N Map,\nmake again, like I said we could use that.\n\n232\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.050\nYou could do stuff to find,\nyou could use routers to the services,\n\n233\n00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.000\na lot of those would help you out,\nNetCat would help you out.\n\n234\n00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.760\nThere's just so many things to\nhelp you to pull this information.\n\n235\n00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.760\nNot to mention,\nthey're not loaded into Kali by default or\n\n236\n00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.990\nyou may actually have to go and\ndig around and find them.\n\n237\n00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.500\nThey have Perl scripts and\n\n238\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.610\nBASH scripts that you can run that will\nspecifically send probes at a router\n\n239\n00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:32.345\nto help you engineer, reverse engineer\nwhat that rule set looks like.\n\n240\n00:14:32.345 --> 00:14:37.330\nSo you can start extracting that on it\ntoo and once you get that you can get\n\n241\n00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:42.130\na pretty good picture of how that's\nconfigured and just go from there.\n\n242\n00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.590\nAnd it's kind of scary how\neasy it is to do that.\n\n243\n00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.280\nIt used to be in the old days,\nyou had to use a port scanner and\n\n244\n00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.330\npretty much a packet crafter and\n\n245\n00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.810\nyou scanned and shot packets at\nthe thing to see what went through and\n\n246\n00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.630\nwhat didn't, and you use that to kind\nof build up your knowledge of it.\n\n247\n00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.090\nNow, you have tools like Kali\nthat can say we're not even\n\n248\n00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.780\nplaying by those rules anymore.\n\n249\n00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.310\nI have a script though,\nI'll fire a bunch of stuff at it, and\n\n250\n00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.900\npull some other things off of it.\n\n251\n00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.390\nYou saw in that first tool,\nit even can pull like version numbers and\n\n252\n00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.300\nbug histories and\nstuff like that if they're in there, and\n\n253\n00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.720\ntell you what you need to know about that.\n\n254\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.650\nAnd remember,\nif I can get enough off of a device,\n\n255\n00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:27.250\nlike version numbers and\nstuff like that and model numbers,\n\n256\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:32.630\nonce I can get that, you don't have\nto keep interacting with that device.\n\n257\n00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.470\nYou can use really any operating system at\nthat point to open up a web browser and\n\n258\n00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:41.250\ngo look up that model and see what\nthe history of it is and other things and\n\n259\n00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.890\nsee where you might want\nto go In your attack.\n\n260\n00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.105\nAnd this is just routers.\n\n261\n00:15:46.105 --> 00:15:49.018\nSwitches have their own things and\nstuff like this too.\n\n262\n00:15:49.018 --> 00:15:54.427\nSwitches have there own stuff to probe\naround and see how they're configured.\n\n263\n00:15:54.427 --> 00:15:56.100\nAnd even to bypass them.\n\n264\n00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:01.090\nYou have plenty of tools in there\nto bypass those if you wanna try,\n\n265\n00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.540\nif someone's made a mistake.\n\n266\n00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:09.170\nWe have ones where we can be up\non a switch hard enough that it\n\n267\n00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.140\nturns into a hub, and\nnow we go right around it and\n\n268\n00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.000\nnow we're sniffing larger\nsections of the network.\n\n269\n00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.810\nSections that we shouldn't have\nseen because the limitations of\n\n270\n00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.450\nthat switch is supposed to place on it.\n\n271\n00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.870\nBut we just kick it out of the way and\nsay have a nice day and keep moving on.\n\n272\n00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:28.840\nSo that's just to show you,\nwe already did some of that stuff in\n\n273\n00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:33.090\nour exploration of KaLe and\nthen we did it in ethical hacking.\n\n274\n00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.680\nBut that just show you that we do\nhave plenty of tools that can,\n\n275\n00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.356\nreally ruin your whole day or\nmake your whole day.\n\n276\n00:16:40.356 --> 00:16:45.810\nAll right I would say as a defender\ndon't be afraid to use these things.\n\n277\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:50.620\nIf you find a mistake that's actually\na good thing because it means that you\n\n278\n00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.190\ncan fix it before somebody else finds it.\n\n279\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.420\nYou know don't sit there like I give up.\n\n280\n00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.800\nFix it.\nFind out why you messed it up and\n\n281\n00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.820\nhopefully because you had to go through\nthe work you don't make it again,\n\n282\n00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.320\nthat's my philosophy.\n\n283\n00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.720\nIt's a big enough mistake, yeah, you may\nfeel dumb, and maybe justified, maybe not.\n\n284\n00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.760\nBut it makes an impression on you and\nyou address it and\n\n285\n00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.610\nhopefully you don't do it again.\n\n286\n00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:15.370\n>> Yeah, that's really the big catch\nthere is we've gotta make sure that\n\n287\n00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:18.390\nwe're testing our configurations and\nwe're setting the stuff up properly.\n\n288\n00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.820\nWe can't just assume,\ncuz we know what that spells.\n\n289\n00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.520\nSo we get tools like this, and we test\nour routers to make sure we find any\n\n290\n00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.600\nmisconfigurations, hopefully before\nthe bad guy does, hopefully in a test\n\n291\n00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.160\nenvironment before we put it out\ninto our production environment.\n\n292\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.450\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n293\n00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.000\nTest the stuff out.\n\n294\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.030\nHave someone else take\na look at it that you trust.\n\n295\n00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.090\nI did that early on in my career.\n\n296\n00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.090\nStill do it now as a matter fact.\n\n297\n00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:47.340\nI will run things by people I\nknow that are in this field and\n\n298\n00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.630\nsay what do you think about this.\n\n299\n00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.890\nAnd I always make sure the people I\nam asking are people who will tell me\n\n300\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:54.950\nif I am full of it or not.\n\n301\n00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.890\nAnd sometimes they will\nuse those words and\n\n302\n00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:01.170\na lot harsher ones too which is funny\nbecause I can use the same ones back.\n\n303\n00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's good to have those resources.\n\n304\n00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.530\nBut anyway that's just\nto show you the tools,\n\n305\n00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.290\nthe scripts are available to do this.\n\n306\n00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.865\nSo got prouder to bang on\nthat's really interesting.\n\n307\n00:18:11.865 --> 00:18:14.565\nWe could bang on a little wireless one or\nsomething like that.\n\n308\n00:18:14.565 --> 00:18:17.355\nYou're not gonna see anything\ntoo exciting off that.\n\n309\n00:18:17.355 --> 00:18:23.065\nIt's gonna be kinda just blah but hey,\nyou can practice on one yourself.\n\n310\n00:18:23.065 --> 00:18:24.777\nThese are the ones that work.\n\n311\n00:18:24.777 --> 00:18:26.555\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Kidding.\n\n312\n00:18:26.555 --> 00:18:31.075\n>> Only if you don't wanna work there\nanymore that would be a good idea.\n\n313\n00:18:31.075 --> 00:18:32.835\nSo a lot of good information on routers.\n\n314\n00:18:32.835 --> 00:18:33.995\nWhat do we got next on tap?\n\n315\n00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.960\n>> We talked about the router part,\njust to kinda\n\n316\n00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.705\nrevisit the other one, cuz I don't think\nwe really paid it enough attention here,\n\n317\n00:18:45.705 --> 00:18:50.390\nis really to mention the that\nswitching aspect again.\n\n318\n00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.360\nThe switches that we're talking\nabout in here are just really,\n\n319\n00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.640\nwhen we get into it we're talking about.\n\n320\n00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.750\nI kinda like to call them true switches.\n\n321\n00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.261\nThe real basic ones, the layer two stuff.\n\n322\n00:19:02.261 --> 00:19:06.080\n>> The layer of three\nswitches with V LANs and-\n\n323\n00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:06.580\n>> Yeah, I mean,\n\n324\n00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.430\nyou can start including those in but\nwhen we talk about switches I tend to say,\n\n325\n00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:17.660\nokay if I'm just saying switch without\nany special justification it's layer two.\n\n326\n00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:22.010\nAnd then I know there's layer three and\nother stuff going on.\n\n327\n00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.890\nYou can throw those into the mix and a lot\nof the same stuff that we talked about for\n\n328\n00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.960\nlayer two you can also test\non the higher level ones but\n\n329\n00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.025\njust to make sure to clarify.\n\n330\n00:19:31.025 --> 00:19:36.030\nBut don't under estimate\nthe value of switches and\n\n331\n00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:42.220\ndon't under estimate the fact that there\nare plenty of ways to bypass those too.\n\n332\n00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.010\nHowever, let me kinda\nthrow something into this.\n\n333\n00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.330\nIs one of the things\nwe have with switches,\n\n334\n00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.370\nas well as routers and other hardware.\n\n335\n00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:54.720\nThis is a huge, huge, huge issue in\nthe consumer market, home market,\n\n336\n00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.270\nenterprise market, happens all the time.\n\n337\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.680\nWith these devices,\nyou can do all this great stuff to it.\n\n338\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.190\nOr with your network,\n\n339\n00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.430\nyou can do all this great stuff to make\nsure everything's nice, safe, and sound.\n\n340\n00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.840\nAnd to maintain it and one of the parts\nto maintaining it is patching it.\n\n341\n00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.320\nYou may see where I'm going with that.\n\n342\n00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.500\nIs that when you think about patching and\n\n343\n00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.860\nkeeping stuff up to date quite\nfrequently that's all gonna,\n\n344\n00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.840\nall that tension's going to be focused\nat the software and application side.\n\n345\n00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.660\nAnd hardware tends to be\nkind of the after thought.\n\n346\n00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:33.260\nHopefully it isn't, I wanna say that\nI'm wrong on that more than i'm right.\n\n347\n00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.790\nSo there's environments\nthat i'd like to say,\n\n348\n00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.330\nthere are more environments\nthat are actually being more\n\n349\n00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.907\nmindful to patch those things that\nupdate those things then there aren't.\n\n350\n00:20:42.907 --> 00:20:47.480\nBut in my experience it has been these\nhardware devices plus other ones they can\n\n351\n00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.500\nhave firmware and all that's in place for\n\n352\n00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:56.270\nyears before someone finally takes\na look at it saying well yeah, heck,\n\n353\n00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.703\nwe should of updated that\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n354\n00:20:57.703 --> 00:20:59.460\n>> Like three years ago and\n\n355\n00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.470\nthat may be a big problem for you.\n\n356\n00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:06.550\nYou know not saying if just because\nit is available you should apply it.\n\n357\n00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:12.540\nI'm saying that you should have some\nprocess or some mechanism in place where\n\n358\n00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.800\nyou can evaluate and actually be notified\nif these things are available, and\n\n359\n00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.500\ntake a look to see if there's something\nthat you need to put in place right now,\n\n360\n00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.490\nor if it's something that\nyou can don't have to.\n\n361\n00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:29.130\nAt least know that, I mean,\nI see it happen far too often.\n\n362\n00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:34.010\nI mean, there's plenty of devices that\nwill, that roll into the marketplace and\n\n363\n00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:38.010\nthey get deployed in some environment or\nwhat have you.\n\n364\n00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:42.630\nThey get deployed into that and the only\ntime the firmware's ever patched is when\n\n365\n00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.570\nthey come from the factory and they\nget it in their hands at the place and\n\n366\n00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.190\nthey're, if they read the instructions,\nthey look through it and\n\n367\n00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.770\nsay make sure you're updated\nto the latest version.\n\n368\n00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.741\nOnce you have that,\nthe instructions are gone.\n\n369\n00:21:55.741 --> 00:22:00.468\nAnd no one thinks about it, those things,\nthat's where the values and some of\n\n370\n00:22:00.468 --> 00:22:05.210\nthe tools we have in [INAUDIBLE] they can\npull a version information off of that.\n\n371\n00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:08.594\nIf I see an older version\nthat is kind of what's,\n\n372\n00:22:08.594 --> 00:22:12.470\nwell that's kind of\nsomewhat music to my ears.\n\n373\n00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.200\nBut it also kind of\ntells me that you might\n\n374\n00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.880\nbe at least somewhat paying\nattention to other things, or\n\n375\n00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.000\nasleep at the wheel to a certain degree,\ncuz you're missing that.\n\n376\n00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.190\nAnd it kind of makes be a little more\ncurious and a little more curious,\n\n377\n00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.170\na little more aggressive at finding\nother stuff that you may have missed.\n\n378\n00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:36.330\nSo don't forget that, is the hardware\nalso needs to be upgraded and\n\n379\n00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.220\nthat's something that's common with\nevery piece of hardware out there.\n\n380\n00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.647\nI mean think about it,\n\n381\n00:22:41.647 --> 00:22:46.312\nwhen's the last time you probably most\nif not all of us have smart phones.\n\n382\n00:22:46.312 --> 00:22:48.796\nWhen's the last time you checked for\nan update?\n\n383\n00:22:48.796 --> 00:22:51.349\n>> IOS updates itself,\nI just wait for them to come out.\n\n384\n00:22:51.349 --> 00:22:52.233\n>> Yeah, well you don't count.\n\n385\n00:22:52.233 --> 00:22:57.139\n[LAUGH] And that's actually a good thing\n\n386\n00:22:57.139 --> 00:23:02.380\nthat you have devices that do that.\n\n387\n00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:07.180\nThey realize on those devices,\n\n388\n00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:12.410\none of the things that Apple's been\nvery good at over the years is that\n\n389\n00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:16.540\nthey've made their devices easy to use and\ntaken care of some of those things.\n\n390\n00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.090\nAnd that's one of\nthe things they realized.\n\n391\n00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:22.832\nThe average Joe isn't gonna necessarily\nlook at, or even think about it, at all.\n\n392\n00:23:22.832 --> 00:23:25.370\n>> I've got relatives that\nyou look at their iPhone or\n\n393\n00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.340\nwhat happen if its a few versions behind.\n\n394\n00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.760\nThey've gotten better and\nI'm pushing that stuff out and\n\n395\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.690\nletting you know but it's easy to do.\n\n396\n00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.485\nI don't remember the last time I updated\nthe firmware on my router at the house,\n\n397\n00:23:35.485 --> 00:23:37.920\nupdated at my bios.\n\n398\n00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:43.128\n[CROSSTALK] I reinstalled the operating\nsystem at my house the other day and\n\n399\n00:23:43.128 --> 00:23:48.590\nsaid let me check the bios and I was 3\nversions behind So, yeah that happens.\n\n400\n00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.730\n>> It's something you\ndefinitely keep an eye on.\n\n401\n00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:57.280\nI can tell you, probably each and\nevery person who watches this,\n\n402\n00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.270\nif they were just to\ngo back to their home,\n\n403\n00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:05.070\nthey could start looking at the hardware\ndevices they have around there.\n\n404\n00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:11.360\nI'm talking about TVs,\ngame consoles, set top boxes.\n\n405\n00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.170\nWhen's the last time you checked\nthose to make sure that they\n\n406\n00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.080\nreally have the latest firmware?\n\n407\n00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.220\nMost people, they just plug it in, they\nsee some blinking lights, and okay good.\n\n408\n00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:23.560\nYou know in the home environment, you\nalmost have the same mentality you know in\n\n409\n00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.710\nthe Enterprise environment where it plugs\nit in, and they do some stuff on it.\n\n410\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.330\n\"Hey it works, good job.\" And\nthey're off doing something else.\n\n411\n00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:35.660\nAnd these things, except for\nrule changes and stuff like that now and\n\n412\n00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.040\nthen the firmware doesn't get\nthe attention that it needs.\n\n413\n00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:44.620\nAnd that's something that, it's almost\nlike a ticking timebomb in some cases.\n\n414\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.100\nAnd that's maybe what I need to get in.\n\n415\n00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:52.070\nAnd you may wonder why if you went through\nthe ethical hacking course with us.\n\n416\n00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.360\nSome of the things we talked about.\n\n417\n00:24:55.210 --> 00:25:00.890\nI said in there stuff is older,\nand I made that same comment my\n\n418\n00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:05.950\nbook to people when they were you and\nnot going well at that\n\n419\n00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:11.860\nstuff that was used maybe like two,\nthree, four years ago.\n\n420\n00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.920\nI mean we want more modern stuff.\n\n421\n00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.440\nLike you're telling me you always\nhave the most modern stuff and\n\n422\n00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.065\nyou've updated everything,\nyou've done all this right?\n\n423\n00:25:19.065 --> 00:25:21.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like coming up to me and\n\n424\n00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:25.150\ntelling me, there's no NT four\nsystems left in the world.\n\n425\n00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.880\nThen there's no OS2\nsystems left in the world.\n\n426\n00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.280\nThere's probably people Googling that.\n\n427\n00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.660\nThere are and if you don't think so,\nyou're kidding yourself.\n\n428\n00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.160\nSo you have to remember\nthat these old things,\n\n429\n00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.880\nsome of these older exploits will still\nwork because people have this older stuff,\n\n430\n00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.700\nthey're not giving it any attention.\n\n431\n00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.540\n>> Very good.\n\n432\n00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.230\nAll right, well a lot of good\ninformation about securing our network\n\n433\n00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:50.400\ninfrastructure and taking a look\nat it from the design perspective,\n\n434\n00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.940\nmaking sure that we're, We're setting\nthings up properly in the first place.\n\n435\n00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.920\nSo anything else, Sean,\nyou wanna throw into this episode.\n\n436\n00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.030\n>> We could've left a whole bunch of\nsilence in there because no one's paying\n\n437\n00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:00.800\nattention.\n\n438\n00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.120\nThey're all checking their\nsmartphones updating [LAUGH]\n\n439\n00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.310\n>> No, I don't have anything to add to it.\n\n440\n00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:08.920\nI think we got what we\nneed to get out on that.\n\n441\n00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.620\n>> All right, very good.\n\n442\n00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.320\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n443\n00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.830\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n444\n00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.910\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm MIke Rodrick.\n\n445\n00:26:14.910 -->

00:00:15.970\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.790\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.780\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.550\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.580\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.044\nWe are continuing on our CASP,\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner.\n\n9\n00:00:25.044 --> 00:00:26.870\nGot to make sure I get that one right and\n\n10\n00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.870\non this episode, Sean, we're going to take\na look at protecting our network traffic.\n\n11\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.370\nAnd we saw in previous episodes we talked\nabout encryption and things like that.\n\n12\n00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.990\nAnd we said sometimes you were\nworrying about data that's at risk,\n\n13\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.750\nsometimes we're worried about\ndata that's in motion, right?\n\n14\n00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.759\nYes, so those are the two places where you\nreally got to focus on if want to simplify\n\n15\n00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:51.613\nit is when it's moving or sitting some\nplace.and just to focus on motion part.\n\n16\n00:00:51.613 --> 00:00:57.254\nWe've talked about numerous technologies\nthat do that and talked about SSL,\n\n17\n00:00:57.254 --> 00:01:03.090\ntalked about TLS, we've talked about\nbringing VPNs into the picture.\n\n18\n00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.190\nThere's really so\nmany options that you can use.\n\n19\n00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.520\nAnd then the question becomes when\nyou go to secure that traffic\n\n20\n00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.110\nthat can it be kept confidential,\nonly do you need to verify integrity, or\n\n21\n00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.973\ndo you need also to add in authentication\ncapabilities, and creation.\n\n22\n00:01:18.973 --> 00:01:23.910\nYou know the answer probably in\nmost cases is really all of that.\n\n23\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.010\nWhen you get down to it.\n\n24\n00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.770\nBecause all of those things are if you're\nto be securing traffic, you might as well\n\n25\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.260\nbe doing all of that because it really\ngives you the highest level of security.\n\n26\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.440\nOtherwise, why bother?\n\n27\n00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.060\nThe thing with you have to remember\nwhen you secure traffic though,\n\n28\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.410\nis it's something that\nyou're always going to have\n\n29\n00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.850\nsomeplace you're going to have\nto consider it on your network.\n\n30\n00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.350\nThe question,\nwhich one's the best to use, and\n\n31\n00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.820\nwhich one's going to get you\nthe most performance out of it?\n\n32\n00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.100\nBecause any one of the technologies plus\nother ones we haven't even brought up in\n\n33\n00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.430\nhere, any one of them can do\na good amount of security and\n\n34\n00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.480\ncan do really strong level security.\n\n35\n00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.700\nThe question is that when you start\nromping up the level of security\n\n36\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.110\nyou're talking typically about\nraising encryption levels and\n\n37\n00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.950\nusing stronger algorithms and\nlonger keys and stuff like that.\n\n38\n00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.750\nAll those things are going to really\nimpact you as far as your level of\n\n39\n00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.240\nperformance, because the computer\nhas to be crunching on that, and\n\n40\n00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.820\nthat's on both ends, to make that happen.\n\n41\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.020\nAnd it's also important to recognize\nthat these technologies are complex,\n\n42\n00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.180\nthey do take some configuration and\nplanning.\n\n43\n00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.860\nAnd even in the case of\nsome of them like SSL,\n\n44\n00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.040\nthere are ways to actually\neven defeat that, you know?\n\n45\n00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.312\nSo some of these things that sound like\nthey're airtight which they are build as.\n\n46\n00:02:39.312 --> 00:02:39.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n47\n00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.320\nwith you're IP SEC, it's airtight.\n\n48\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.080\nYou know, SSL it's airtight.\n\n49\n00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.665\nNo it's not.\n\n50\n00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:46.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're just really not.\n\n51\n00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.260\nYou use them, and you configure them\nto a good level that's going to\n\n52\n00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.060\nprobably thwart just about everyone out\nthere but there's still a possibility.\n\n53\n00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.070\nBut the one we talked about yesterday and\n\n54\n00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.090\nwant to take a look at here is IPsec.\n\n55\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.830\nIPsec's been around now for\na while, it's been around what,\n\n56\n00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.640\nfor about 20 years at this point.\n\n57\n00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.160\nSeem to remember it going back that far,\nbut I may be wrong.\n\n58\n00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.880\nBut it's been around for\na considerable length of time.\n\n59\n00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.240\nIt is supported across platforms, so\n\n60\n00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.020\nit's not something that's built\ninto a very specific platform.\n\n61\n00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.700\nIt's used across the board.\n\n62\n00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.870\nYou know, really on all of them,\n\n63\n00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.830\nit's just a question of how\nyou configure it on each, and\n\n64\n00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.170\nare you using the system maybe so old that\nyou don't support, sometimes that happens.\n\n65\n00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.030\nSo just about all the major\noperating systems do support it, and\n\n66\n00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.480\nthey use it really for the same reason,\nso you can talk back and forth.\n\n67\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.590\nNow the thing that,\n\n68\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.082\nthe system that we're going to be most\nfamiliar with is going to be Windows.\n\n69\n00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:50.950\nSo, we'll just be looking at it here and\nhow it works and it's configuring windows.\n\n70\n00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.670\nJust so you can see that and\n\n71\n00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.960\nhopefully when you're looking at how\nthis goes, as Mike's going to demo it.\n\n72\n00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.616\nWhen you're looking at this whole\nthing of how IP sec is configured.\n\n73\n00:04:02.616 --> 00:04:05.720\nWhat you want to be kind of paying\nattention to is not just the security it\n\n74\n00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.390\nprovides, but try to bring in some of\nthe stuff that we talked about during\n\n75\n00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.230\nencryption, and\nsee how that's fitting into the picture.\n\n76\n00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.790\nBecause you should see some things\nright away that just say oh yeah,\n\n77\n00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.810\nI know what that does, and\nthat does, and that does.\n\n78\n00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.540\nEven if it's your first\ntime looking at IP sec.\n\n79\n00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.940\n>> All right, so\nwe'll take a look at it then.\n\n80\n00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.420\nI'm just going to set up\na quick little IPsec lab here.\n\n81\n00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.938\nOne of the other things that I find\nwith Windows admins sometimes,\n\n82\n00:04:27.938 --> 00:04:33.370\nthey forget that they might rely on NTFS\nencryption to encrypt data that's at rest.\n\n83\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.140\nAnd we tend to forget that when\nyou copy that across the network.\n\n84\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.230\nWhen you move it from the file\nserver to the client, or\n\n85\n00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.440\nyou're uploading that encrypted\nfile up to the file server,\n\n86\n00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.890\nthe encryption's gone\nduring that transmission.\n\n87\n00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.190\nIt's NTFS encryption,\nthat's part of the file system, so\n\n88\n00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.630\nit's encrypted while it's at rest there,\nbut it has to be decrypted,\n\n89\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.520\nsent across the network, and\nthen encrypted again at the other end.\n\n90\n00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.470\nThat's one of the places\nI love seeing IPsec,\n\n91\n00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.332\nis it's protecting it\nwhile it's in motion.\n\n92\n00:04:58.332 --> 00:05:00.670\nAll right, so, what I've got here,\nI've got just a simple client.\n\n93\n00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.000\nI'm going to ping one of my web servers\nthat I have, one of my virtual machines.\n\n94\n00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.280\nJust verify that I've got some\nelectrical connectivity there,\n\n95\n00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.310\nthat we are able to communicate.\n\n96\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.500\nAnd I'll flip back over\nto that web server and\n\n97\n00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.560\nopen up my Windows firewall\nwith advanced security.\n\n98\n00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.870\nIn the Windows world,\nremember starting in 2008,\n\n99\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.230\nthey combined the firewall\nwith the IPsec console.\n\n100\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.160\nAnd we now have that Windows\nfirewall with advanced security and\n\n101\n00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.500\nthey've changed IP sec policies\nto connection to security rules.\n\n102\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.480\nWhich are really decided when we're\ngoing to encrypt that traffic and\n\n103\n00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.300\nI'll just right click and choose New Rule.\n\n104\n00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.420\nAnd when you come into\nthat New Rule Wizard,\n\n105\n00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.550\nI've got several options I can choose\nfrom depending on what I'm trying to do.\n\n106\n00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.690\nIsolation, I want to limit all\ncommunications like say, domain members.\n\n107\n00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.820\nUntil some vendor comes in and\n\n108\n00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.580\nthey connect to that network, they're not\na part of that domain, and their machine\n\n109\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.620\nwill not be able to connect with whatever\nnodes I have this policy in place on.\n\n110\n00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.300\nYou've got authentication exemptions,\nwhich are really good when you're setting\n\n111\n00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.120\nup these rules, you might have some\ndevices, as Sean said, that don't support\n\n112\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.865\nIP sec, and if that device needs\nto communicate with that server,\n\n113\n00:06:07.865 --> 00:06:11.230\nis not going to be able to if\nyou're doing required security.\n\n114\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.280\nSo authentication exemptions allow\nme to let those devices communicate\n\n115\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.590\neven without the encryption.\n\n116\n00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.160\nWe could do it for DHCP servers.\n\n117\n00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.460\nThings like that.\n\n118\n00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.890\nServer to server.\n\n119\n00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.190\nSecuring a connection\nbetween two machines.\n\n120\n00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.980\nTunnel, same thing really,\njust authenticating between two computers.\n\n121\n00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.630\nAnd then custom, which I'm going to do.\n\n122\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.586\nBecause it lets me see all the options\ninstead of having a pre-configured\n\n123\n00:06:33.586 --> 00:06:34.200\none here.\n\n124\n00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.550\nI click next and\nI get to choose my end points.\n\n125\n00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.970\nAnd I'm just going to leave it wide open.\n\n126\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.780\nI don't see anybody that's trying\nto connect to this server.\n\n127\n00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.930\nNow in this example,\n\n128\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.880\nI'm going to be using ping because\nit's just the easiest way to demo it.\n\n129\n00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.090\nBut you might think, you know, using this\nfor file transfers or things like that.\n\n130\n00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.630\nI'm just going to leave\nthe end points wide open.\n\n131\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.360\nThen I'll click next.\n\n132\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.520\nAnd then I've got a choice here.\n\n133\n00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.470\nIn the Windows environment\nwe've got three basic policies.\n\n134\n00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.560\nRequest authentication for\ninbound and outbound.\n\n135\n00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.180\nRequire inbound, request outbound.\n\n136\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.500\nOr require both.\n\n137\n00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.240\nIf I say a request, then when somebody\ntries to communicate with the server,\n\n138\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.940\nit's going to say, hey let's secure it.\n\n139\n00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.640\nLet's encrypt this traffic.\n\n140\n00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.410\nIf the other end says I\ndon't understand IPsec.\n\n141\n00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.670\nWell it was just a request and\n\n142\n00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.190\nhe'll let it connect anyway\neven though it's not as secure.\n\n143\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.250\nIf you choose require authentication, that\nmeans when any node tries to connect with\n\n144\n00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.940\nthat server, it's going to require them\nto authenticating and this traffic.\n\n145\n00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.670\nIf the other end cannot,\nit'll drop the connection.\n\n146\n00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.930\nIt won't allow it if\nyou set it to require.\n\n147\n00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.200\nAnd then you can require both inbound and\noutbound.\n\n148\n00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.010\nAnd I'm just going to require inbound and\nrequest outbound for this one.\n\n149\n00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.090\nAnd I'll click next.\n\n150\n00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.900\nAnd then how do I want to\nauthenticate the other end?\n\n151\n00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.420\nThe default user authentication method\nas specified in our IP settings, or\n\n152\n00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.040\nI can just set right here.\n\n153\n00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.500\nTo authenticate via the computer and\nthe user.\n\n154\n00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.533\nOr, just the computer,\nor I can choose advance,\n\n155\n00:07:58.533 --> 00:08:02.662\nwill let me choose more than one\nmethod and the order it does them in.\n\n156\n00:08:02.662 --> 00:08:06.285\nThese options here Computer and\nUser, and Computer.\n\n157\n00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:09.245\nAre dealing with Kerberos so\nthis would be domain members.\n\n158\n00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:12.420\nI'm gonna do computer only for\nthis little demo, and I'll click next.\n\n159\n00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.822\nAnd then for this,\nI'm just gonna choose ICMPV4.\n\n160\n00:08:16.822 --> 00:08:20.407\nSo that means only ICMP traffic\nis gonna require authentication,\n\n161\n00:08:20.407 --> 00:08:23.450\nanything else would be\nallowed to come through.\n\n162\n00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.910\nAgain not the best thing\nto do in the real world.\n\n163\n00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.790\nTypically not trying to\nauthenticate our ping packets.\n\n164\n00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.600\nBut for a demo, it works very well.\n\n165\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.350\nWe'll click next, but\nyou can see from the wizard.\n\n166\n00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.910\nI can be very specific about\nthe protocol that was being used,\n\n167\n00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.628\nI could choose specific port numbers.\n\n168\n00:08:39.628 --> 00:08:43.310\nSo maybe I'll only want to authenticate\nif it's coming across a specific port.\n\n169\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.350\nI'll leave it out again on ISMPV4,\nI'll click next.\n\n170\n00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.678\n>> If I can step in here\n>> Oh absolutely\n\n171\n00:08:48.678 --> 00:08:50.958\n>> I think this is a good point also to\n\n172\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:55.441\nalso emphasize, we were looking\nat yesterday, FTP and TelNet,\n\n173\n00:08:55.441 --> 00:09:00.590\nwe an actually for example, FTP,\nwe can lock that down to a specific port.\n\n174\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.590\nWe know the port for\n\n175\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.090\nthat, if we haven't modified anything\nwe know the port it's going to work on.\n\n176\n00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.911\nAnd so we said that yesterday,\n\n177\n00:09:06.911 --> 00:09:11.410\nwe said FTP doesn't have anything\nin the way of security on its own.\n\n178\n00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.700\nThis could be a way that you actually\ncould provide that by looking at\n\n179\n00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.310\nthe specific ports and say okay, well,\nit doesn't have it but I'm gonna\n\n180\n00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.250\nhave just he core protocol wrap something\naround it to make it more secure.\n\n181\n00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.150\nSo even though it's still\nworking the way it always has,\n\n182\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.750\nif it uses FTP with this machine then\nit will go ahead and secure that.\n\n183\n00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.470\nSo you could provide protection\nwhere it might not otherwise be.\n\n184\n00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.020\n>> Yeah exactly, I could come in here,\nI don't know if they have FTP but I could\n\n185\n00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.310\nchoose custom, and I could definitely\nspecify those port numbers there.\n\n186\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.990\nAll right, so we'll click next on that.\n\n187\n00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.360\nWe get to the profiles, just for\n\n188\n00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.659\nthis lab environment, I'm gonna leave\nit on all three profiles to make sure,\n\n189\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.390\nwell it applies it to everyone,\nthat way we don't have to worry about it.\n\n190\n00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.310\nI'll click next.\n\n191\n00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.625\nSometimes my virtual machines don't\ndetect the domain profile properly.\n\n192\n00:09:56.625 --> 00:09:58.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I wanna to make sure that they\n\n193\n00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.280\ndo it to every network.\n\n194\n00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:00.950\nAnd I'll give it a name.\n\n195\n00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.710\nI'll call it secure ping, Woo hoo, and\n\n196\n00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.890\nI'll click finish, and I've got\na connection security rule in place.\n\n197\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:14.040\nAnd if I flip back over to my client and\nI attempt to ping again, we'll\n\n198\n00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.230\nsee that it resolves the name in to the IP\naddress but I'm getting request time data.\n\n199\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.230\nAnd that's because with IPsec,\n\n200\n00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:27.160\nboth ends of the conversation\nhave to have a policy in place.\n\n201\n00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.910\nThe server's now saying,\nwoah wait a second,\n\n202\n00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.740\nif you want send ICMP traffic to me,\nit has to be authenticated.\n\n203\n00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.990\nThe client is not set up to authenticate\nanything, he is like, I don't know what\n\n204\n00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.050\nthe heck you are talking about,\nwhat is this authentication you speak of.\n\n205\n00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.855\nAnd so he is not doing it,\nthe server is saying, no it's requires so\n\n206\n00:10:42.855 --> 00:10:46.200\nI'm not going to respond to you, I'm not\ngoing to let you communicate with me.\n\n207\n00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.630\nSo I open my windows firewall with\nadvanced security on the client, and\n\n208\n00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.640\nwe basically make the the matching rule.\n\n209\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.150\nAnd of course, in a Windows environment, I\ncan do this through active directory group\n\n210\n00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:59.050\npolicy and I could apply these\npolicies to all my machines.\n\n211\n00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.300\nI wouldn't have to do this individually.\n\n212\n00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.260\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\njust do pretty much the same rule.\n\n213\n00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.160\nThey'd do have to match.\n\n214\n00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.490\nFor the client,\nI'm gonna put it on request.\n\n215\n00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.000\nBecause not all communications coming\nto my client need to be authenticated.\n\n216\n00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.472\nSo I'll leave that on request.\n\n217\n00:11:15.472 --> 00:11:17.690\nThat gives him the ability\nto speak IP SEC if needed.\n\n218\n00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.030\nBut it doesn't force him\nto do it all the time.\n\n219\n00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.180\nMy server, I want everything coming\ninto that to be authenticated.\n\n220\n00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.729\nI'll click Next.\n\n221\n00:11:26.669 --> 00:11:29.250\nAnd I'll make a matching policy over here.\n\n222\n00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.120\nIf they can't agree on an authentication\nmethod, they won't be able to communicate.\n\n223\n00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.940\nAnd I'll do this just for ping on v4.\n\n224\n00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:45.020\nAnd I'll apply it to all 3 profiles,\nand again secure ping.\n\n225\n00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.556\nThe names don't have to match.\n\n226\n00:11:48.556 --> 00:11:53.660\n[LAUGH] All right, after that finished,\nthat puts that rule in place and\n\n227\n00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:58.250\nnow if I go back over to my command\nprompt and I try to ping one more time.\n\n228\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.140\nAll of the sudden I'm connecting again,\nthose pings are allowed.\n\n229\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.380\nNow if we go over to the monitoring node.\n\n230\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.540\nIn my Windows firewall with advanced\nsecurity, I should see that\n\n231\n00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:17.020\nI now have a secure connection established\nbetween 201, which is that web server.\n\n232\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.970\nAnd then another thing I wanna show you\nwhile we've got this open is we'll talk\n\n233\n00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:25.190\nabout that authentication\nexception that we can do.\n\n234\n00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.330\nSo right now he's requiring\nanybody that tries to ping him\n\n235\n00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.240\nis gonna be required to authenticate.\n\n236\n00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.300\nWhat if I had a device that\ndid not understand IP sec, and\n\n237\n00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.156\ncouldn't communicate but needed to.\n\n238\n00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:39.000\nI could come in here,\nand I can make whoops,\n\n239\n00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.550\nlet's do an authentication exemption,\nI'll click next, and then I'll add, and I\n\n240\n00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.140\nwanna make sure I got the right IP address\nthere, I wanna say he was 100, and he is.\n\n241\n00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.684\nAlright so\nyou can do this by IP address by\n\n242\n00:12:54.684 --> 00:12:59.460\nSubnet I'll do it by IP address.\n\n243\n00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.352\nI like this too, you can do it by\na predefined set of computers and\n\n244\n00:13:04.352 --> 00:13:08.413\nyou can pick particular servers, it makes\nit much easier than trying to list all\n\n245\n00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.921\nthe IP addresses of my DHCP servers for\nexample.\n\n246\n00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.202\nAnd Next, and Next.\n\n247\n00:13:16.202 --> 00:13:17.770\nAnd then oops.\n\n248\n00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.710\nI must give it a name.\n\n249\n00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:25.810\nAnd I'll call this Casper 1 exemption.\n\n250\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.974\nSo now what I'm going to do is if\nI flip back over to the client.\n\n251\n00:13:35.144 --> 00:13:36.826\nAnd I disable this rule.\n\n252\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.680\nHe should not be able to\ncommunicate at that point, right?\n\n253\n00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:50.000\nIf I disable this rule but\nbecause of that exemption that we made.\n\n254\n00:13:52.315 --> 00:13:53.610\nHe's still able to ping.\n\n255\n00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.990\nIt shows you how to set up those IP\nsec policies, make it match, and\n\n256\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.540\nalso how to create\nan exemption if you need to.\n\n257\n00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.780\n>> Something I see when I look\nat something like this with\n\n258\n00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.290\nexemptions\n>> Is,\n\n259\n00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.420\nit may not have been something\nthat you would think of outright,\n\n260\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.370\nyou know, especially saying,\nwhat I said a few moments ago about well,\n\n261\n00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:18.370\nyou have all these systems that support\nIP secs, and it's pretty much the norm.\n\n262\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.560\nIs that you're going to find\nany modern operating system and\n\n263\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.770\nthat's a pretty broad statement to make.\n\n264\n00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.030\nAny modern operating system that's\ngoing back to at least 2000.\n\n265\n00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:32.290\nSome people would make a comment that\nwhen the time Windows 95 came out,\n\n266\n00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.860\nthat's the modern operating system.\n\n267\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.380\nWhatever, but most modern operating\nsystems, if not all, are supporting IPsec.\n\n268\n00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.640\nSo it makes the question of well,\nwhen how often would you have to use this?\n\n269\n00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.000\nWell you may not have had to use it\ntoo often necessarily in the past, but\n\n270\n00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.330\nthink about it, just had this conversation\nwith a friend of mine the other day,\n\n271\n00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.020\nyou have that whole emerging internet\nof things as they like to call it.\n\n272\n00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.970\nI could see these devices\nthat you're plugging in,\n\n273\n00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:04.570\nin different areas, maybe even on your\nown corporate networks in some cases.\n\n274\n00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.230\nYou've got a baby operating system in it,\nthe IP sec\n\n275\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.330\nmay not have been something that you say,\noh yeah we've got to put that in.\n\n276\n00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:16.260\nSo you may have to have situations where\nsome of these things might be streaming\n\n277\n00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:21.400\ndifferent types of content or\ndoing different types of communication.\n\n278\n00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.090\nJust don't have that.\n\n279\n00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.710\n>> Right, absolutely.\n\n280\n00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.860\nAnd another thing that you'll see.\n\n281\n00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.800\nI can show you on my screen here.\n\n282\n00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.010\nIt was pretty quick,\n\n283\n00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.540\nright, because I've got two virtual\nmachines running on this one system.\n\n284\n00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.530\nBut notice after I set that rule in place.\n\n285\n00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.810\nUp here you can see where\nmy request was timing out,\n\n286\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.390\ndidn't have that rule in place.\n\n287\n00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.920\nHere's the one after I enable\nthe rule on the client.\n\n288\n00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.830\nAnd take a look at that first ping packet.\n\n289\n00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.220\nThe time there was 313 milliseconds.\n\n290\n00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.580\nAnd then it dropped back down to 1,\nand you can see I'm averaging 1 and\n\n291\n00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.530\n2 on these guys down here.\n\n292\n00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.811\nAnd what that's showing you is that\nwhen they first go to communicate,\n\n293\n00:15:55.811 --> 00:15:57.569\nthey have to compare IP sec policies.\n\n294\n00:15:57.569 --> 00:16:00.874\nThey have to negotiate How\nthey're gonna authenticate, so\n\n295\n00:16:00.874 --> 00:16:03.805\nthat's putting some delay on that traffic,\nright.\n\n296\n00:16:03.805 --> 00:16:05.324\nAnd, if you're talking about a.\n\n297\n00:16:05.324 --> 00:16:10.400\nYou don't want that same overhead\non things like your DNS requests or\n\n298\n00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.437\nyour DORA process with your DHCP and\nthings like that.\n\n299\n00:16:14.437 --> 00:16:18.130\nSo those are good reasons to add some\nof those exceptions in there as well.\n\n300\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.390\nCuz certain types of traffic,\nyou don't need to authenticate it, right,\n\n301\n00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.650\nor you don't need to encrypt it.\n\n302\n00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.412\nWe're going to save that overhead,\nsave that delay there.\n\n303\n00:16:25.412 --> 00:16:27.929\n>> Yeah, it's a good example of that,\n\n304\n00:16:27.929 --> 00:16:34.070\nit would sound like someone with IPSec\non the surface, someone coming in new.\n\n305\n00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:38.380\nIf it all this stuff of sniffing and all\nthese other types of things you can do.\n\n306\n00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.836\nWell just IPSec everything, just shut\nit down, apply it across the board,\n\n307\n00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:44.210\nturn it back on, everything's safe.\n\n308\n00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:48.645\nIt's just not really practical, or\nreally something that's necessary to do.\n\n309\n00:16:48.645 --> 00:16:54.850\nLike I'm saying, DHCP, stuff like that,\nit may not be necessary there.\n\n310\n00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:55.510\nYou could say yeah,\n\n311\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:17:01.264\nthere's some attacks against DHCP where\nI could kill it on the pen testing side.\n\n312\n00:17:01.264 --> 00:17:04.950\nBut still, as long as it's\nprotecting the information and\n\n313\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:10.365\nstuff like that then, heck, it's probably\nnot a big deal for you to do that.\n\n314\n00:17:10.365 --> 00:17:13.150\nSo you really kinda gotta,\nwith these type of things,\n\n315\n00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:17.200\nwhenever I've gone over a firewall rules,\nor doing something like IPSec,\n\n316\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.890\nanything like this, you really need\nto think these things out, and\n\n317\n00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.600\nbe really meticulous about what really\nneeds to be secured and what doesn't.\n\n318\n00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.000\nDon't just say, don't get a hand\ngrenade and throw it out there and\n\n319\n00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.400\nsay we got everything.\n\n320\n00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.320\nNo, you've gotta be a lot more\nsurgical [LAUGH] with it and\n\n321\n00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.645\nsay these things need to be protected.\n\n322\n00:17:35.645 --> 00:17:37.450\nThis other stuff, not necessary.\n\n323\n00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.260\n>> Yeah, you could cause a nightmare on\nyour network if you go to your domain\n\n324\n00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.820\ncontrollers and\nyou require authentication for everything.\n\n325\n00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.891\nAnd you've got machines\nthat are booting up and\n\n326\n00:17:44.891 --> 00:17:47.376\ntrying to authenticate with\nthe domain controller, yet\n\n327\n00:17:47.376 --> 00:17:49.992\nyou're requiring authentication,\nyour log on traffic.\n\n328\n00:17:49.992 --> 00:17:52.640\nYou gotta make all kinds of\nexceptions then for those policies.\n\n329\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.140\n>> Yeah.\n\n330\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.760\n>> You definitely don't\nwant to just blanket say,\n\n331\n00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.620\nI want everything protected,\nyou gotta really plan it out.\n\n332\n00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.414\nAnd that's what CASP is all about,\ndesigning a secure network.\n\n333\n00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:02.895\n>> Yeah, it's a, and\nI hate to use the term, but\n\n334\n00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:05.470\nit's intelligent design is what it is.\n\n335\n00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.265\nNot the other type [LAUGH].\n\n336\n00:18:07.265 --> 00:18:08.304\nYou know what I mean?\n\n337\n00:18:08.304 --> 00:18:10.600\nIt's being intelligent\nabout how you design.\n\n338\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.140\nIt's not just going through and saying\nokay, I'm gonna get a big roller and\n\n339\n00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.720\npaint everything with it and\nsay okay, now we're good.\n\n340\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.962\nNo, you can't really do that,\n\n341\n00:18:18.962 --> 00:18:21.910\nyou gotta be a lot more\nthoughtful in how you plan stuff.\n\n342\n00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:24.200\nAnd then you'll get good results,\nand you'll be happy with it and\n\n343\n00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.180\nhave something that has\nraised the bar on security.\n\n344\n00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.436\n>> Absolutely, all right so\n\n345\n00:18:28.436 --> 00:18:33.560\nwe talked about IPSec, what else do we\nwant to talk about here with encryption?\n\n346\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.840\n>> Well I think something to kind\nof bring in to the picture here is,\n\n347\n00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.970\nwe talked yesterday and\nover other sections, we talked about SSL.\n\n348\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.660\nNow, just to make sure we're all\non the same page with what SSL is,\n\n349\n00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:50.490\nit's just how you secure\ncommunications between two points.\n\n350\n00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.070\nSimilar to IPSec in a lot of ways.\n\n351\n00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.810\nA place where you typically see it is for\ndoing E-commerce or\n\n352\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.530\nlogging into web mail, stuff like that.\n\n353\n00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.650\nBut it is present in\nother areas to be sure.\n\n354\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:07.020\nSo we have this technology that's been\nin use for a long, long, long time.\n\n355\n00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.550\nAnd it's been put in place\nbecause it's been doing the job.\n\n356\n00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:16.434\nBut it's a good example though of how\nsomething that you think is really bullet\n\n357\n00:19:16.434 --> 00:19:20.950\nproof, and actually, I'm not gonna\nuse the term bullet proof for SSL.\n\n358\n00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.303\nWhat I'm gonna say, actually,\nit's a good technology and\n\n359\n00:19:24.303 --> 00:19:28.310\nhas really stood the test of time\nover its evolution from way back.\n\n360\n00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.250\nI think Netscape's the one that did it.\n\n361\n00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.469\n>> Yeah, I wanna say I was reading\nsomething the other day that was pretty\n\n362\n00:19:32.469 --> 00:19:34.425\ninteresting, that they were\nthe ones that originated SSL.\n\n363\n00:19:34.425 --> 00:19:35.567\n[LAUGH]\n>> Some of you\n\n364\n00:19:35.567 --> 00:19:37.470\npeople are gonna have to look up Netscape,\nsorry.\n\n365\n00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:41.520\nSo, [LAUGH] but it's been around for\na long time and\n\n366\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.560\nit's really done a good job\nat what it was intended for.\n\n367\n00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.520\nHowever, you do still here\nabout attacks against it, and\n\n368\n00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.590\nit's even successful attacks.\n\n369\n00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:56.241\nThey had one not too long\nago where they were actually\n\n370\n00:19:56.241 --> 00:20:01.006\nable to find a hole in\nthe software that supports SSL.\n\n371\n00:20:01.006 --> 00:20:06.459\nWhere they could just send a sequence of\ncommands at a system that supports SSL and\n\n372\n00:20:06.459 --> 00:20:11.670\ncause, well in this case a server,\nsend a sequence of commands and say well,\n\n373\n00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:17.240\nif you don't support this form of SSL,\njust downgrade to an older version.\n\n374\n00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.800\nAnd those older versions, they had\nholes and stuff like that in them.\n\n375\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.350\nAnd so what happened is the person that\nconfigured that server just went in and\n\n376\n00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.200\nenabled those old versions saying okay,\nI want the biggest range of compatibility.\n\n377\n00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.490\nAnd so, if you support the modern\nversion it would try that first, and\n\n378\n00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.910\nit would say okay, you support it,\ngood, you'd never see these things.\n\n379\n00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:38.800\nBut those people that had older\nclients and hadn't done upgrades and\n\n380\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.950\nstuff like that, and you know they're\nout there, they'd hit that system and\n\n381\n00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.510\nthey couldn't support the newer version.\n\n382\n00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:49.140\nSo they system would say, okay, I've\ngot something I can help you out with,\n\n383\n00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:53.490\nand would switch to an older,\nI won't say deprecated version,\n\n384\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.910\nbut it is definitely be considered legacy\nversion, something that shouldn't be used,\n\n385\n00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.530\nthere's been holes in it.\n\n386\n00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.110\nSo once that was found out,\n\n387\n00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:06.220\nattackers were going to servers\nthat had that particular flaw.\n\n388\n00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.850\nThey could do some scans and find it out.\n\n389\n00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.082\nAnd then they could just force when\nthe initial handshake was made to say,\n\n390\n00:21:10.082 --> 00:21:11.239\nno, no, no, I don't support that.\n\n391\n00:21:11.239 --> 00:21:14.448\nAnd it would kick it down to the old\nversion, they'd break it and\n\n392\n00:21:14.448 --> 00:21:17.850\ncould get in to the server and\ndo all sorts of nonsense at that point.\n\n393\n00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.370\nThey could even go through and\nuse that as a way to\n\n394\n00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.580\nget around the more modern version, and do\nsomething to shut that off completely or\n\n395\n00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.090\nreconfigure it so\nthey can do what they want anyway.\n\n396\n00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.230\nSo it was pretty nasty, and\n\n397\n00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:34.150\nthat's really a configuration problem\nmore than it is an SSL problem.\n\n398\n00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.864\nEven though the flaw,\nit's exploiting a flaw in SSL,\n\n399\n00:21:36.864 --> 00:21:40.345\nyou could get rid of that just by\nunchecking those boxes, so to speak,\n\n400\n00:21:40.345 --> 00:21:44.373\nin whatever technology you're using and\nsaying, I'm just not gonna use that.\n\n401\n00:21:44.373 --> 00:21:46.500\nAnd then someone can't do it.\n\n402\n00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.150\nIf you go to that server now and\n\n403\n00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.870\nI've disabled it, you go to that server\nand say hey I don't support that.\n\n404\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.620\nServer's going to say well hey,\nsee you later.\n\n405\n00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.880\nWhen you get into the 21st century,\ncall me.\n\n406\n00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.609\nThat's what happens.\n\n407\n00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:01.770\n>> Kinda sounds like a double edged sword.\n\n408\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:06.501\nI think we are on SSL 3 but as a network\nadmin I don't wanna limit my customers,\n\n409\n00:22:06.501 --> 00:22:07.014\nright.\n\n410\n00:22:07.014 --> 00:22:10.566\nI wanna make sure that all those\npeople can come to my website and\n\n411\n00:22:10.566 --> 00:22:12.860\nbuy my products so I wanna enable.\n\n412\n00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.930\nDo I want to be secure and force them to\nonly use the latest version of SSL, and\n\n413\n00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.170\nif they not, they can't buy my product.\n\n414\n00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.278\nOr do I allow them to come in with\nthose older versions of SSL, but\n\n415\n00:22:22.278 --> 00:22:24.536\nnow expose myself to\nthose vulnerabilities?\n\n416\n00:22:24.536 --> 00:22:25.360\nIt's a tough call.\n\n417\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.317\n>> Yeah, and that's precisely a lot of\nplaces will go through, because it comes\n\n418\n00:22:30.317 --> 00:22:35.510\nto that risk/reward type thing or\nthat cost/benefit, whatever you get.\n\n419\n00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.222\n>> They look at security as being\nsomething that's just a big black hole to\n\n420\n00:22:38.222 --> 00:22:39.589\nthrow money into in a lot of places.\n\n421\n00:22:39.589 --> 00:22:43.690\nAnd so they don't want SIP in\nthe way of things like sales.\n\n422\n00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.334\nSo what they'll do is say,\n\n423\n00:22:45.334 --> 00:22:48.844\nhow likely is that gonna be\na problem on the security side?\n\n424\n00:22:48.844 --> 00:22:54.360\nWell, probably not, it's still SSL is SSL\nas far as the general public's concern.\n\n425\n00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.940\nBut when this came out, it caused\na re-evaluation of things, saying well,\n\n426\n00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.640\nif you have people that\nare using a technology or\n\n427\n00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.756\na version of it that's really\nquite old at this point,\n\n428\n00:23:03.756 --> 00:23:08.478\nthen we've got to draw the line somewhere.\n\n429\n00:23:08.478 --> 00:23:10.820\nAnd so\nthey just started getting rid of that,\n\n430\n00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.920\nsaying nope, we can't have that anymore.\n\n431\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.410\nYou can look up that attack.\n\n432\n00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.860\nIf you Google SSL downgrade attack,\nor something like that,\n\n433\n00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.320\nyou can get the particulars on it.\n\n434\n00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.892\nI've simplified it a bit for here, but\njust to illustrate that something that's\n\n435\n00:23:24.892 --> 00:23:29.464\na good technology, you can do things that\nwould actually weaken it or allow people\n\n436\n00:23:29.464 --> 00:23:33.863\nto get around it and just ignore the fact\nthat you have good security over here.\n\n437\n00:23:33.863 --> 00:23:38.200\nBut over here, I'm just gonna leave that\ndoor as it is, I'll go through this door.\n\n438\n00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.160\nSo that's one thing you can do with SSL,\n\n439\n00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.360\nand, like I said,\nthat's on the configuration side.\n\n440\n00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:51.838\nThe other thing you can do is you can\nlook up a technology called SSL Strip.\n\n441\n00:23:51.838 --> 00:23:58.700\nI've actually got those on my cell\nphone and in my phone pad back here.\n\n442\n00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.182\nYou can grab that even for Linux systems.\n\n443\n00:24:02.182 --> 00:24:07.560\nAnd what it is, it's a man in the middle\nattack, is what it actually boils down to.\n\n444\n00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.950\nAnd, what you do is you poison the network\nand cause a victim to go through your\n\n445\n00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:18.355\nsystem to go some place else and then\nyou lure them in with an HTTP address.\n\n446\n00:24:18.355 --> 00:24:21.890\nThey go to you and then when they\ncome through on the other side,\n\n447\n00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.645\nthey're basically using you as a proxy,\nthey go through you with HTTP and\n\n448\n00:24:25.645 --> 00:24:28.615\nyou translate it over SSL\ntraffic on the other side.\n\n449\n00:24:28.615 --> 00:24:34.210\nSo, they think they're actually working\nand everything's as it should be.\n\n450\n00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:38.704\nBut they're going right on through\nsomebody else that's translating it to SSL\n\n451\n00:24:38.704 --> 00:24:41.730\nand the responses back\nfrom SSL back to them.\n\n452\n00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:46.300\nSo that's one of the things,\nyou've got to look at that URL,\n\n453\n00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.040\ndoes that URL actually say HTTP or HTTPS?\n\n454\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.960\nEven though it says HTTP, it's possible\nthat someone could've gone out\n\n455\n00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.790\nthere an d poisoned your system,\nyour ARP cache and routed\n\n456\n00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:04.920\nyour stuff right through theirs and, are\nswapping stuff back and forth actively.\n\n457\n00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.660\nTranslating HTTP to HTTPS and back and\nforth, they're doing the requests,\n\n458\n00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:14.606\nsending the requests for you and\nsending the replies back to you and\n\n459\n00:25:14.606 --> 00:25:18.190\nmeanwhile, they're\nrecording all this stuff.\n\n460\n00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:19.610\n>> In middle attacks.\n\n461\n00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:20.980\n>> Yeah, it's a pretty nasty one.\n\n462\n00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.300\nIt takes just a little bit\nof effort to set up too.\n\n463\n00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.430\nSo you don't really have to do too much.\n\n464\n00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.610\nIt's basically set up the system as\na proxy, and figure out what you're going\n\n465\n00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.111\nintercept and go poison the victim and\nle the fun and games begin.\n\n466\n00:25:35.111 --> 00:25:37.140\n>> Nice.\n>> And you're now intercepting,\n\n467\n00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.590\nall you've got to do now is turn on\nsomething like wire shark or D sniff or\n\n468\n00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.815\nwhatever, intercept those credentials,\nor that information,\n\n469\n00:25:43.815 --> 00:25:46.910\nwhatever it is you're looking for,\nand you're good to go.\n\n470\n00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.340\nHeck you may just want to credentials.\n\n471\n00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.440\nOnce you've got them, kill the connection,\nI'm going to log in on your behalf and\n\n472\n00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.750\nstart causing It starts causing problems.\n\n473\n00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:59.540\nAnd that's something that's not\nexploiting a flaw in SSL at all.\n\n474\n00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.460\nThat's SSL's working as it's supposed to.\n\n475\n00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.320\nInstead of it going from this point\nall the way to this point and\n\n476\n00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.510\nstopping it right here.\n\n477\n00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.550\nAnd I'm translating it,\nsending it back all the way over to you.\n\n478\n00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.320\n>> Yeah.\n>> So that's called SSL strip,\n\n479\n00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.740\nif you want to look in to that one.\n\n480\n00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.635\nIt's got automated utilities for\nthat, believe it or not.\n\n481\n00:26:19.635 --> 00:26:20.440\n>> [LAUGH] We believe it.\n\n482\n00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.870\nThen the last thing I know we want to\ntalk about there Sean is firewalls,\n\n483\n00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:28.390\nanother big component in\nthe security of my network.\n\n484\n00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.040\n>> Yeah, we've done some discussion\non firewalls in here already.\n\n485\n00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.910\nWhat I kinda just wanna quickly\npoint out there you can,\n\n486\n00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:38.350\nif you have a Kaylee and\nyou're still playing around with that,\n\n487\n00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:42.510\nyou may wanna take a look at something\ncalled the firewalk utility in there.\n\n488\n00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:46.880\n>> And the reason why that utility is\ninteresting is it's just a command line\n\n489\n00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:52.230\nutility that you tell it\nthe ports you want to scan and\n\n490\n00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.730\nthe system you want to scan and\n>> And\n\n491\n00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.330\nyou just send your information out to it.\n\n492\n00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.700\nAnd execute the command.\n\n493\n00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.290\nI mean there's a little more to it but\nwhat happens is it'll send the stuff out\n\n494\n00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:06.520\nto that system and it will first of all\ngo through a phase called ramping where\n\n495\n00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.560\nit tries to find out how far away\nthat system you're targeting is.\n\n496\n00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.870\nAnd see how long it takes to respond,\nso it's calibrating itself and\n\n497\n00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.790\nfiguring out where that is.\n\n498\n00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:23.160\nOnce its done that, it will start sending\nspecially crafted probes to that target.\n\n499\n00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.220\nTo say okay, how long should I wait for\nthe responses to come back or\n\n500\n00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:32.540\nnot before I declare that's dropping\nthose packets or receiving those packets.\n\n501\n00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:37.840\nAnd so by doing this and you really\ncan configure these command or script\n\n502\n00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.740\nrather to do things for you, you can\nstart reverse engineering that rule set.\n\n503\n00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.297\nYou can dump all that out from that\ncommand to a text file and then review it,\n\n504\n00:27:46.297 --> 00:27:49.799\nand use it to say, okay, well, this is\nwhat I gotta do on my attack because\n\n505\n00:27:49.799 --> 00:27:53.278\nI found this port, this port, and\nthis port are open but these ones are.\n\n506\n00:27:53.278 --> 00:27:56.909\nAnd this is the time it takes for\nthem to respond, so\n\n507\n00:27:56.909 --> 00:28:00.202\nnow you can readjust your\nattack to account for\n\n508\n00:28:00.202 --> 00:28:05.130\nthe fact that it may take longer or\nshorter to respond to something.\n\n509\n00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:10.190\nPlus there's other stuff too, you can\neven tell it what range of ports to go to\n\n510\n00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:13.970\nYou can tell what port to\nscan from your system.\n\n511\n00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.530\nSo you don't have to tell\nit to go through any port.\n\n512\n00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.795\nYou can say go out through port 53 or\nport 80.\n\n513\n00:28:18.795 --> 00:28:22.610\nMaybe port 80's open and you expect it to.\n\n514\n00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.370\nYou can route the scan\nright through port 80 and\n\n515\n00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:30.480\nout to the victim and\nhave responses come back and\n\n516\n00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.120\nreally be kinda stealthy that way so\nit look like normal internet traffic.\n\n517\n00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:38.919\nSo, that's the way of automating\n\n518\n00:28:38.919 --> 00:28:44.530\nthe extraction of\ninformation from a firewall.\n\n519\n00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:47.970\nYou can build that rule set, reverse\nengineer it by firing these things at\n\n520\n00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:52.240\nit and once you're done,\nnow you've got a very good insight\n\n521\n00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.380\ninto how they're doing things and figure\nout where you're gonna go from there.\n\n522\n00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.840\n>> Or test my own rule set and\n\n523\n00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.980\nsee where the heck I goofed up and\nwhat I need to fix.\n\n524\n00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.260\n>> Yeah, it could be.\n\n525\n00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.440\nI would say on that part of it, if\nyou're an intermediate or advanced user,\n\n526\n00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:11.050\nyeah, than that would be a orobably in\nthe high leveled intermediate side.\n\n527\n00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:16.140\nEven it would help you out, because\nyou still have to know at that phase,\n\n528\n00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.910\nor looking at this, that this is\nwhat it is actually telling you.\n\n529\n00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:21.440\nYou just say these are open or\nthis how long it's taking to respond,\n\n530\n00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.340\nthese are the rules that are in place.\n\n531\n00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.860\nIf you setup the firewall it\nshould give you an exact copy or\n\n532\n00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.240\nvery close to what you have.\n\n533\n00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:34.030\nSo you're just going to see a copy of\nthe mistakes, it won't call them out.\n\n534\n00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.020\nBut it may be a good sanity check for\n\n535\n00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:40.460\nyou because if you are an intermediate or\nadvanced user, you can look at that and\n\n536\n00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.670\nsay, okay I set it up over here and over\nhere, oh that's what' they're seeing and\n\n537\n00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.860\nthat's what the effect of it is, and\nI can make a tweak over here to do it.\n\n538\n00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.610\nBut you still have to be able\nto interpret the results.\n\n539\n00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:49.670\nBut you could use it for that.\n\n540\n00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.850\n>> Alright well Sean again,\nanother great episode,\n\n541\n00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:56.670\na lot of great information on securing\nour network, our infrastructure, and\n\n542\n00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.730\nour traffic as it flows\nacross our network.\n\n543\n00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.030\nSo anything else you wanna\nthrow into this episode?\n\n544\n00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.890\n>> Those are the big things that\nthey need to take away I think,\n\n545\n00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:09.300\nis that the understand I didn't wanna\ntalk specifically about firewalls or,\n\n546\n00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.910\nabout what they are and all that.\n\n547\n00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.850\n>> Kind of expect that, most people\nknow that, it's just to show that\n\n548\n00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:17.750\nthings like firewall, SSL,\nare those are definitely vulnerable.\n\n549\n00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:21.070\nAnd then,\nyou got a good look at IP sac and\n\n550\n00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.510\nhow that can be one way\nof securing your traffic.\n\n551\n00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.510\nAnd don't underestimate it,\nit's a very very powerful tool.\n\n552\n00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.030\nSo it definitely merits you, get in and\n\n553\n00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.250\nget your hands dirty on it\n>> Very good.\n\n554\n00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.680\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen\nthat's going to do it for this one.\n\n555\n00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.050\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n556\n00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.143\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI am Mike Rodrick.\n\n557\n00:30:37.143 --> 00:30:38.070\n>> And I am Sean Oriyano.\n\n558\n00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.227\n>> And we will see you next

00:00:15.940\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.950\nHow you doing Shawn?\n\n5\n00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.220\n>> I'm doing pretty good how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.610\n>> I'm doing well, excited to be here.\n\n7\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.040\nWe've got another episode\ncoming your way in our\n\n8\n00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.330\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner\nseries, and in this one Sean,\n\n9\n00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.170\nwe're gonna be taking about\nweb services security.\n\n10\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.540\nSo, probably a big part of\nwhat we need to secure, huh?\n\n11\n00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.055\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:36.910\n[LAUGH] There's a lot happening here.\n\n13\n00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.050\nAnd this is one of those things that\n\n14\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.540\nwe covered in much broader\ndetail in ethical hacking.\n\n15\n00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.102\nBut we're gonna look at it again,\nmaybe introduce some new stuff here and\n\n16\n00:00:49.102 --> 00:00:51.950\nkind of talk about what that means\nto you as far as your design.\n\n17\n00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.710\nBecause that's really the name\nof the game since you have seen\n\n18\n00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.740\nsome of the pen testing side already.\n\n19\n00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.400\nWhat does that mean for\nyou in design standpoint?\n\n20\n00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.370\nWhat can you put in place to both\nprovide a level of service and\n\n21\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.110\nfunctionality as well\nas keep it protected?\n\n22\n00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.020\nIt's a fine line, it's kind of a tightrope\nalmost you're walking but you can do it.\n\n23\n00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.060\n>> There seems to be a big shift.\n\n24\n00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.940\nOur web servers used to be a very common\nattack vector that people would use.\n\n25\n00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.250\nWeb servers have come a long way and\nmuch more secure and things like that, but\n\n26\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.690\nwe have to run all those darn services,\n\n27\n00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.900\nall those web applications\nthat are being developed.\n\n28\n00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.010\nAnd the security on those,\nsometimes, is not so good.\n\n29\n00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.830\nThey're developed in-house, or\nthey're developed in a rushed way or\n\n30\n00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.050\nmanner and not thoroughly tested.\n\n31\n00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.780\nAnd all of a sudden they open up all these\nnew vulnerabilities on our web server.\n\n32\n00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.900\nBy its nature it has to be accessible,\nright?\n\n33\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.980\nIf it's a public-facing website,\nwe can't just shut it down or\n\n34\n00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.610\nblock it off from the Internet.\n\n35\n00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.180\n>> Yeah, you really can't just go\nthrough and yank the cable out and\n\n36\n00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.890\nsay okay it's safe.\n\n37\n00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.919\nYou have accomplished at\nleast the safe part of it,\n\n38\n00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:06.708\nI guess I have, but\nit's not useful as a web server anymore.\n\n39\n00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:09.425\n>> Your revenue for\nyour e-commerce is gonna go downhill fast.\n\n40\n00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:10.063\n[LAUGH].\n\n41\n00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:13.243\n>> Yeah, unless you unplug someone\nelse's or hold it hostage but\n\n42\n00:02:13.243 --> 00:02:14.690\nthat's a different story.\n\n43\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.060\nIt's definitely one of these things\nthat by its very nature you have to\n\n44\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.497\nhave a web server and\nthe services on top of it exposed,\n\n45\n00:02:24.497 --> 00:02:27.810\nat least if you're doing\nbusiness with the public.\n\n46\n00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.290\nI mean there are cases where\nyou use them internally.\n\n47\n00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.640\nBut don't think just because\nyou're using it internally that\n\n48\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.820\nyou're completely off the hook.\n\n49\n00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.430\nBecause you always can have\na malicious employee or\n\n50\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.760\nsomething like that deciding that they're\njust gonna smoke you for whatever reason.\n\n51\n00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.425\nIt has happened, it doesn't even\nhave to be someone malicious.\n\n52\n00:02:44.425 --> 00:02:45.300\nIt could be someone,\n\n53\n00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.642\none of you guys trying the stuff\nout when I told you not to.\n\n54\n00:02:47.642 --> 00:02:53.770\n[LAUGH] You kind of need to\nkeep that in perspective.\n\n55\n00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.340\nSo we'll just kind of assume from the\nstandpoint of what we're looking at here\n\n56\n00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.730\nthat this is something you're gonna do for\na public facing service or\n\n57\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.120\nsite, because more than likely that's\none of the big ones you're gonna face.\n\n58\n00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.570\nThe stuff internally you will face but\nthat's kinda a different profile,\n\n59\n00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.910\nand honestly you can include some of\nthe stuff that we're talking here on\n\n60\n00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.880\nthe private side as well.\n\n61\n00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.490\nSo, if we look at our most basic\nthing in this whole process,\n\n62\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.180\nit is the web server and\nthe operating system it sits on top of.\n\n63\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.230\nThose things are being exposed\nto the outside world and\n\n64\n00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.110\nwe can put those in a DMZ or\nheck if you really want to do it,\n\n65\n00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.470\nyou can put it on someone else's\nsystem server someplace else.\n\n66\n00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.560\nWe'll kind of assume,\njust to make it easy,\n\n67\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.490\nthat you are hosting it so you have a DMZ\nand you dropped this right in there.\n\n68\n00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.520\nAnd now you're figuring out,\n\n69\n00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.990\nokay, I know there's DMZ and\nI know the protection that that provides.\n\n70\n00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.820\nThat double walled area where I can\nhave publicly accessible services\n\n71\n00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.110\nthat are protected but at the same\ntime aren't in my private network.\n\n72\n00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.710\nSo we've done that, so you already\ndesign-wise have some protection,\n\n73\n00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.310\nbut you still have to have some\nexposure on that web server.\n\n74\n00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.050\nOtherwise why even put it out\nthere in the first place?\n\n75\n00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:22.040\nWeb servers, we look at them,\nthey're something that is even though they\n\n76\n00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.710\ndo serve up the basic level, just static\ncontent, it's something that's a target.\n\n77\n00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.870\nIt may be the first entry\npoint that a black hat or\n\n78\n00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.065\nan attacker period is gonna use\nto get into your organization.\n\n79\n00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:36.747\nThat's probably gonna be\nthe first thing they see.\n\n80\n00:04:36.747 --> 00:04:42.266\nSo they're gonna use some of the tools\nthat we saw over in our pen testing or\n\n81\n00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:44.690\nour ethical hacking section.\n\n82\n00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.310\nWe saw stuff like Netcraft.\n\n83\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.490\nWe saw that Netcraft makes it very,\n\n84\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.060\nvery easy to get basic\ninformation about a system.\n\n85\n00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.731\nSo we can just go out there and,\nlike I have done here on my screen for\n\n86\n00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:59.224\nthose of you that don't remember Netcraft,\n\n87\n00:04:59.224 --> 00:05:02.262\nto show just how easy it is\nto extract some of the stuff.\n\n88\n00:05:02.262 --> 00:05:04.899\nI just went in and\nstuck in Nintendo's website,\n\n89\n00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:07.161\nwanted to try something different, so.\n\n90\n00:05:07.161 --> 00:05:08.926\n>> No USA Today?\n\n91\n00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:12.790\n>> No USA Today.\n\n92\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.190\nI'm doing this cuz I'm angry they\nhaven't released Zelda yet, the new one.\n\n93\n00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.210\nBut it's been on my mind, I'm obsessive.\n\n94\n00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.860\nBut what we have here is,\nI punched in the actual\n\n95\n00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.390\nURL and you can see it gives\nme the information on it.\n\n96\n00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:35.140\nI can see an IP address staring at\nme right in the face, right there.\n\n97\n00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.857\nYou can see address, we can assume\nthat that address, for right now,\n\n98\n00:05:38.857 --> 00:05:40.500\nwe can assume it's correct.\n\n99\n00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.540\nThat actually is correct.\n\n100\n00:05:43.446 --> 00:05:48.747\nInterestingly enough, I mean,\nyou look at the address for\n\n101\n00:05:48.747 --> 00:05:53.210\nNintendo, and it's got,\nthey're in Redmond.\n\n102\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.230\nMario's going over there\nbeating up Master Chief.\n\n103\n00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.230\n[LAUGH] But anyway, so\nyou can see information on this.\n\n104\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:08.400\nYou can see what it's hosted on top of,\nthe operating system.\n\n105\n00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.560\nThe operating system, as we learned in\nthe ethical hacking side of things,\n\n106\n00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.540\nthat operating system\ndoesn't have to be correct.\n\n107\n00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:21.180\nIn this case, that doesn't make sense\nas an operating system, just doesn't.\n\n108\n00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.920\nThat's a hosting service or something.\n\n109\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.116\nI wanna say IF5.\n\n110\n00:06:25.116 --> 00:06:26.556\nIsn't that an ISP or something?\n\n111\n00:06:26.556 --> 00:06:28.436\n>> I believe so, I'm not sure, though.\n\n112\n00:06:28.436 --> 00:06:32.260\n>> So\nit's clearly not an operating system.\n\n113\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.000\nIt's something that, when the probe\nwhen out at the network level and\n\n114\n00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.280\nthe probe went out at the application\nlevel, the probe at the network level,\n\n115\n00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:47.400\nthe first thing it hit was something\nin front of the actual system behind.\n\n116\n00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.544\nFor the web server,\n\n117\n00:06:48.544 --> 00:06:52.920\nwe can see that the web server when\nit's setup at application-level probe,\n\n118\n00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.310\nsince it wasn't the operating system,\nit continued on and hit the service.\n\n119\n00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.006\nAnd said, the banner grab it got\nwas Apache and so that makes sense.\n\n120\n00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:05.348\nYou do see down that list,\n\n121\n00:07:05.348 --> 00:07:10.690\nyou do see that they have Linux on there,\nwhat three times?\n\n122\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.745\nThat kinda sorta tells us, I expect,\n\n123\n00:07:14.745 --> 00:07:21.635\nI believe memory serves you can\nrun Apache on Windows, but why?\n\n124\n00:07:21.635 --> 00:07:25.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can do it, so\n\n125\n00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.760\nit's unlikely that that's what it'd be, so\n\n126\n00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.910\nwe know it's one of the nix operating\nsystems, so it means it's Unix or\n\n127\n00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.400\nLinux, and I would assume more than\nlikely, nowadays it's gonna be Linux.\n\n128\n00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:42.110\nAnd so we see that on there in\nthe big five, or big five, F5.\n\n129\n00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.290\nAll right, so\nI need more caffeine, apparently.\n\n130\n00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.163\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we see that information there, but\n\n131\n00:07:49.163 --> 00:07:53.493\nyou're seeing really quickly and\neasily we got IP addresses, and\n\n132\n00:07:53.493 --> 00:07:58.362\nwe keep scrolling down this, you can\neven see that it's got Information on\n\n133\n00:07:58.362 --> 00:08:02.100\nthe next level up,\nthe actual application level thing.\n\n134\n00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:08.430\nSo we're seeing there, Amazon Web Servers,\nJava's in use in there, JavaScript.\n\n135\n00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.460\nAnd I haven't even looked at the website,\n\n136\n00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.870\nI'm just pulling this right\ndirectly off of this.\n\n137\n00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.430\nThey've got stats and stuff like that\nhere, it pulled all these things off with\n\n138\n00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:24.250\njust a simple scan of that\nwebsite just using Netcraft.\n\n139\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:30.090\nSo what we saw there is this\nwould be a reconnaissance phase,\n\n140\n00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.920\nthis thing that we are doing.\n\n141\n00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.100\nYou've already got quite a bit of\nstuff that someone can gather.\n\n142\n00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.800\nIs this bad seeing this?\n\n143\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.600\nNot necessarily.\n\n144\n00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.230\nThe stuff doesn't have to be something\nthat is you need to freak out and\n\n145\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.240\nsay I need to fix this.\n\n146\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.740\nIt's what you're looking for when you\nsee this, is could someone do something\n\n147\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.695\nwith it and is it dangerous to have it,\nto leave it out there.\n\n148\n00:08:53.695 --> 00:08:57.320\nCuz whatever they could do is\npretty nasty in of itself,\n\n149\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.225\nwhat I wouldn't want to see on some\nthings see stuff really describing\n\n150\n00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:06.690\nthe technology really thoroughly and\nto tell us, this is how I have it,\n\n151\n00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:11.150\nthis is the configurations I have, and\nthis stuff and this stuff and this stuff.\n\n152\n00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.810\nSo NetCraft is telling us yeah,\nwe have Java and stuff like that.\n\n153\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.300\nSo, yeah, we've gotren some information.\n\n154\n00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.361\nNow the question is, and we could say\nat this point, we're done with this,\n\n155\n00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:23.460\nwe've got information there.\n\n156\n00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.060\nSo the question would be,\nwhat are you going to do with this?\n\n157\n00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.850\nSo you put that in the pile.\n\n158\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.320\nThen the next thing is\nwhat are you going to do,\n\n159\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.670\nwhat other type of\ninformation could you get?\n\n160\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.007\nOther information we looked\nat in our ethical hacking.\n\n161\n00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:42.508\nYou may recall we looked at something\ncalled ID Serve from GRC.com.\n\n162\n00:09:42.508 --> 00:09:46.250\nAnd that one was another\nway of doing a banner grab.\n\n163\n00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.000\nYou could just go out there and\ngo to a site.\n\n164\n00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.920\nAnd it would yank the banner off\nof that and tell you, hey this\n\n165\n00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.500\nis the technology I found in place and you\ncould read the header right there as well.\n\n166\n00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.480\nThe cool thing about that is,\n\n167\n00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.530\nit's probably going to give\nyou a pretty accurate answer.\n\n168\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.660\nBut if you recall when we use that tool\n\n169\n00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.820\nthat we could actually read\nthe server tag itself.\n\n170\n00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.210\nSomeone could remove that server tag.\n\n171\n00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:19.240\nIf you recall an ID Serve and\ngive me a second,\n\n172\n00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.890\nI can probably go ahead and\ndo this for you.\n\n173\n00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.430\nSo yeah, we'll go ahead and\nwe can take that off for\n\n174\n00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.800\nright now with the NetCraft stuff.\n\n175\n00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:33.400\nLet's talk about that GRC\nusing something like ID Serve.\n\n176\n00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.250\nID Serve is a simple tool,\nand I'll get it here and\n\n177\n00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:43.450\nI'll get it up on the screen here for\nyou in a moment.\n\n178\n00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.820\nWhat we'll do is I'm just going to grab\nID Serve and I'm going to use it so\n\n179\n00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.260\nI just got it up here.\n\n180\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.272\nWhat I am going to do is I am just\ngoing ahead and run it right off there,\n\n181\n00:10:53.272 --> 00:10:55.220\nsmall little tool.\n\n182\n00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.802\nI am just going to put in, I'l do\nthe same website that we just had, and\n\n183\n00:10:59.802 --> 00:11:01.780\nsay query the server.\n\n184\n00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.860\nAnd it comes back with Apache as well,\nso okay.\n\n185\n00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.580\nWe've confirmed it in two sources\nthat we consider to be reliable.\n\n186\n00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.660\nSo if we go through and look at this,\n\n187\n00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:17.290\nyou can see that somewhere buried\nin here there is information on.\n\n188\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.978\nThere's a server tag right there.\n\n189\n00:11:19.978 --> 00:11:24.308\nWe're seeing it right there front and\ncenter and it says, server Apache.\n\n190\n00:11:24.308 --> 00:11:27.827\nAnd, of course, if you read through that\nheader, all that header information,\n\n191\n00:11:27.827 --> 00:11:29.520\nthere's other stuff for you.\n\n192\n00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.270\nThis tool's just concerned with\nextracting that server tag and\n\n193\n00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.720\nthis'll displaying it to you.\n\n194\n00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:39.600\nBut if that's something that isn't going\nto be useful to you then you could\n\n195\n00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.220\ngo over here and say okay,\nthis doesn't always get the same results.\n\n196\n00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.610\nThat's actually kind of interesting.\n\n197\n00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:56.430\nSo, the White House has its own distro\nof operating system apparently.\n\n198\n00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.735\nThis is where,\nthis is actually a good example\n\n199\n00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:03.652\nof things you have to think\nabout as a designer as well.\n\n200\n00:12:03.652 --> 00:12:07.517\nOkay, I know looking at this that\nthe server identified itself as\n\n201\n00:12:07.517 --> 00:12:08.700\nthe White House.\n\n202\n00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.894\nYeah, sure, whatever, but\nI told you that this tool is just plucking\n\n203\n00:12:13.894 --> 00:12:18.470\nthe server tag out of there and\nsaying if I find the server tag,\n\n204\n00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:24.340\nwhatever you see after the colon, put\nthat in that box and we'll call it even.\n\n205\n00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.680\nHowever, if you did this on your own\nsystem as part of your designs, and said\n\n206\n00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.660\noh, well, it comes back as White House,\ngood luck on making that work for you.\n\n207\n00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:40.780\nWell, if you go through this, and\nyou start really examining things.\n\n208\n00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.430\nSometimes in these headers,\nyou can see little, subtle clues, and\n\n209\n00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:50.820\nit looks like they may have got a little\nmore knowledgeable about this and\n\n210\n00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.930\ndone their homework on this, is sometimes\nthe stuff you will see come up in there\n\n211\n00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.410\nwill give you clues to the technology\nthat is there in place.\n\n212\n00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:04.140\nAnd you can read into it and\nsay well, they're using Linux and\n\n213\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.830\nthey're probably using\nApache on top of it.\n\n214\n00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:13.100\nI believe that's at least what the\nwhitehouse.gov used to run their stuff on.\n\n215\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.590\nCuz when we used to run this\ntool what you would see\n\n216\n00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:19.120\nis you'd see it would say\neither no server at all.\n\n217\n00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.680\nSo when the server identified itself\nit would say I don't know and\n\n218\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.670\nit would tell you because there's no\nserver tag, it can't tell you what it is.\n\n219\n00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:31.030\nBut all you got to do is scroll through\nthis header and there was a line in it\n\n220\n00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:35.720\nthat included several stuff like\nthat P3P tag on there does.\n\n221\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.790\nIt would include stuff that said Drupal.\n\n222\n00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.390\nAnd Drupal is a content management system.\n\n223\n00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:48.580\nAnd so soon as I saw that I'm going okay,\nthose things indicate that's a Drupal CMS.\n\n224\n00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.990\nI go over to the Drupal site and\nsee what operating system it runs on.\n\n225\n00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.420\nAnd I believe the only\noperating system and\n\n226\n00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.550\nWeb server it ran on\nwas a Apache on Linux.\n\n227\n00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:02.525\nSo just by looking one little\nsubtle clue on there I was able to\n\n228\n00:14:02.525 --> 00:14:05.115\nextrapolate that out with\na little bit of research.\n\n229\n00:14:05.115 --> 00:14:08.095\nSo that's the thing you have to think\nabout is pulling out a tag like this.\n\n230\n00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:11.735\nIf you're designing your Web services and\nall that is pulling out these tags.\n\n231\n00:14:11.735 --> 00:14:13.399\nAre they really going to help you or\n\n232\n00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:17.240\nis it really not going to do anything for\nyou at all?\n\n233\n00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:22.240\nThe average Joe looking at this might very\nwell say hey, they might actually very\n\n234\n00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.590\nwell think that hey, the government's\ndoing something behind the scenes and\n\n235\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:26.830\nthey got their own disk drive.\n\n236\n00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.995\nNo, it's just the way they identified it.\n\n237\n00:14:28.995 --> 00:14:33.590\nSo keep that in mind when you\nare looking at some of these things.\n\n238\n00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.349\nThese tools, you kinda sometimes\nhave to read extra stuff into it.\n\n239\n00:14:37.349 --> 00:14:42.133\nSo that's just a very,\nvery simple example.\n\n240\n00:14:42.133 --> 00:14:44.950\nSo that'll be something that\nyou can do with the Web server.\n\n241\n00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:50.030\nEvery Web server you configure it to\nremove the tags and banners from it.\n\n242\n00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.982\nAnd what it identifies.\n\n243\n00:14:50.982 --> 00:14:54.170\nYou could decide if that's\nsomething that's worthwhile or not.\n\n244\n00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.290\nYou can do stuff to cause it to identify\nas something else like we have here.\n\n245\n00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.030\nI mean you do a lot of things.\n\n246\n00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.590\nThat's just on the Web server side.\n\n247\n00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.950\nWhen you go up above that you've got\nadditional things you can even do with\n\n248\n00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.090\nthe Web application.\n\n249\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.580\nThe Web application,\n\n250\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.738\nyou can do stuff to have it\nidentify authentication systems and\n\n251\n00:15:13.738 --> 00:15:19.020\nhave it crawl the whole site and really\nkind of go through a bunch of stuff.\n\n252\n00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.708\nWhat I was doing over on, and\n\n253\n00:15:22.708 --> 00:15:28.397\nI will switch over to\nanother system here for\n\n254\n00:15:28.397 --> 00:15:35.033\nyou, is what I did is I ran\na scan over on my Kali Box.\n\n255\n00:15:35.033 --> 00:15:41.037\nAnd what I have over here is I ran a tool\nto sweep a domain that I chose and\n\n256\n00:15:41.037 --> 00:15:46.738\nyou can say that it's even picked\nup certificate information and\n\n257\n00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:49.555\nhost keys and all sorts of that.\n\n258\n00:15:49.555 --> 00:15:54.815\nThere's the hosting provider,\nit's got Go Daddy in there, so.\n\n259\n00:15:54.815 --> 00:15:59.750\nIt was trying all sorts of\nstuff against this domain.\n\n260\n00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.000\nYeah, and\njust in case you're paying attention,\n\n261\n00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.010\nyou guys can zoom up on that, I don't\ncare, that's a domain I use for testing.\n\n262\n00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.646\nI own the domain seanoriyanosucks, so\nif anyone's gonna say that, it's me.\n\n263\n00:16:11.646 --> 00:16:13.205\nSo.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n264\n00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:16.061\n>> So anyway it went through and\n\n265\n00:16:16.061 --> 00:16:20.226\nit ran bunches of different scans for me,\n\n266\n00:16:20.226 --> 00:16:27.270\njust kinda going through and\nfinding out what's going on with this.\n\n267\n00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.060\nIt's pretty neat that it did this.\n\n268\n00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.470\nThis is one called GoLismero.\n\n269\n00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.640\nAnd it just crawled the whole site.\n\n270\n00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.010\nIt went through different\nsocial media platforms and\n\n271\n00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:43.220\nstuff like that to see what it could\nspecifically find with the site.\n\n272\n00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.140\nAnd then it even fired up Nmap as\npart of the process to see what it\n\n273\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.310\ncould find with that.\n\n274\n00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:52.160\nAnd what's really, really cool about this,\nyou could even tell it to go and\n\n275\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.920\ntake this information and format it into\na report and put that out there for you.\n\n276\n00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.410\nSo now you have a good level\nof reconnaissance you've done\n\n277\n00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.180\nagainst someone's system.\n\n278\n00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.290\nThis did take a while to do, by the way.\n\n279\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:11.220\nThis is not something that one of\nthe reasons why we had a longer\n\n280\n00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.940\nbreak there is because I had to start this\nup to get a good amount of information,\n\n281\n00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.300\nand took a while to do.\n\n282\n00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.360\nThat test site I have is a very,\nvery small site.\n\n283\n00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.920\nThere's not much there.\n\n284\n00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.900\nSo it's done just for me to go through and\n\n285\n00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.470\njust pound on it and test on the different\nnon-invasive stuff like this is.\n\n286\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.885\nAnd It took a while on that.\n\n287\n00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.825\nIf you're going after a bigger target,\n\n288\n00:17:34.825 --> 00:17:38.965\nyou're going to have to start tweaking\nthe scan so it doesn't take as long but\n\n289\n00:17:38.965 --> 00:17:43.605\nstill there's quite a bit of\ninformation you know in here.\n\n290\n00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:48.885\nIt doesn't really look like much just\nkind of you know scrolling by here but\n\n291\n00:17:48.885 --> 00:17:49.635\nthere's a lot there.\n\n292\n00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:51.846\nYou format to an HTML report or something.\n\n293\n00:17:51.846 --> 00:17:55.108\nIt's gonna be,\n\n294\n00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:59.820\nperformance report it's gonna\nbe a lot more readable and\n\n295\n00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.410\nit's gonna be a lot more understandable\nand you'll see just how much is there so.\n\n296\n00:18:05.322 --> 00:18:06.520\n>> All right, so good example of,\n\n297\n00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.280\nyou know,\nsome of the things we've gotta look at.\n\n298\n00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.220\nAnd we're trying to secure our\nweb servers and our web services.\n\n299\n00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:16.000\n>> Yeah don't ever under estimate this\ntype of of stuff that someone can gather\n\n300\n00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.340\nand, just to put one more\nthing into play here,\n\n301\n00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:28.300\nis using something like this, Maltego.\n\n302\n00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.790\nThis is something that some of you saw\n\n303\n00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:38.250\nwhen we did our ethical\nhacking portion of things.\n\n304\n00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:43.320\nWhat I can do with this one is, this one\neven has a simple wizard interface on it\n\n305\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.130\nthat I can put in just any URL and\nI can do a quick non-invasive scan so\n\n306\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.790\nit's not penetrating anything at all so\nI can put in,\n\n307\n00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:57.890\nyou know, put in like a small,\nI'll just put in a Nintendo again.\n\n308\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.955\nI'm gonna pick on them today.\n\n309\n00:18:59.955 --> 00:19:03.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, it will do it's scan and\n\n310\n00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.810\nyou can see it's gonna start doing it,\ndoing it's thing.\n\n311\n00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.590\nIt's asking me, are these okay,\nis it okay to run this scan.\n\n312\n00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.660\nYeah, go right ahead.\n\n313\n00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.700\nYou only have to do this.\n\n314\n00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.110\nJust accept any of these things.\n\n315\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.430\nOnce, I just updated it before I ran it.\n\n316\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.530\nSo it's saying okay I found the site.\n\n317\n00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.140\nIs this the URL you\nare wanting me to scan?\n\n318\n00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:29.130\nIf it found more than one URL it\nwould say these may be sub ones or\n\n319\n00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.950\nones that are close.\n\n320\n00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.590\nSo I go through and so\nokay well that's fine.\n\n321\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:39.440\nSo I'm just you know running\nthrough doing different things and\n\n322\n00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.650\nyou can see it's doing stuff over there.\n\n323\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:47.000\nLet me open that window up and\nwhat I've got\n\n324\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.260\nthere is in a few short button clicks you\ncan see the domain in the middle of that.\n\n325\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.000\nBut then I see around it.\n\n326\n00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.210\nYou can see, this is the domain,\nthis is the actual web site itself.\n\n327\n00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:05.520\nCuz remember the domain doesn't represent\na web site that we typically make\n\n328\n00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.890\nthat connection between the two.\n\n329\n00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.310\nBut domain doesn't automatically\nmean you have a web site there.\n\n330\n00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.670\nSo it's gone through, and\nso there's the domain.\n\n331\n00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.000\nThere's the website.\n\n332\n00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.850\nThere's the technologies that are being\nused that it recognizes very quickly\n\n333\n00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:19.950\noff the top.\n\n334\n00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:24.070\nAnd then when I go over here, it's even\npulling out additional information.\n\n335\n00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.960\nThere's the net block, so\nit's IP address net block.\n\n336\n00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.120\nAnd then it's even pulling out\nadditional stuff over here.\n\n337\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.920\nAnd I could keep digging down in that too.\n\n338\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.653\nI mean this can go pretty far.\n\n339\n00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:43.510\nThose who remember Maltego you can\nright-click on just about anything in here\n\n340\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:48.320\nand get even more information\npopping up on DNS records and\n\n341\n00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.560\nall sorts of interesting\nstuff a long the way and\n\n342\n00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.450\nwhat's cool about that from this tool,\nis that yes there's a free version of it.\n\n343\n00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.540\nThis happens to be the paid version of it.\n\n344\n00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.191\nWhat's really cool about this stuff\nwas whether you get the free or\n\n345\n00:21:04.191 --> 00:21:08.480\nyou decide to cough up the money for the\npaid version which if you're really in.\n\n346\n00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.810\nI would say not to try to be\na sales person or anything here.\n\n347\n00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:16.960\nIf you're someone that is\ngonna be doing pen testing or\n\n348\n00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.460\ndoing audits of your security and\n\n349\n00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.570\nkind of want to see what other\npeople can find, it's not that much.\n\n350\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:28.550\nIt's just around $1,000 for the paid\nversion, and while it's not a small amount\n\n351\n00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.570\nthe information it yields on\nwhat's out there about you.\n\n352\n00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.480\nAnd this isn't the only stuff it can do.\n\n353\n00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.590\nIt is incredibly invaluable.\n\n354\n00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:41.990\nThis stuff can do this but it can also do\nstuff like analyze Twitter information and\n\n355\n00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.020\nFacebook information, stuff like that.\n\n356\n00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.040\nIt can go right on through and see,\nokay what's being talked about you,\n\n357\n00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.790\nwhere are you being posted?\n\n358\n00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.420\nIt can find out stuff that,\nit can find out\n\n359\n00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.880\nemails that have come from your domain\nthat maybe people have posted online.\n\n360\n00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.007\nAnd so you can find out,\nmaybe if an employee got disgruntled and\n\n361\n00:21:59.007 --> 00:22:00.542\ndid something stupid.\n\n362\n00:22:00.542 --> 00:22:05.367\nAnd posted stuff on a newsgroup someplace.\n\n363\n00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:07.540\nYou could track that down pretty quickly.\n\n364\n00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.900\nSo think about that from\nterms of a security breach,\n\n365\n00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.890\nsomeone posted insider information.\n\n366\n00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.650\nThis could be very, very,\nvery valuable for you.\n\n367\n00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.990\nLike I said,\nnot to mention the stuff that we have.\n\n368\n00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.910\nWe already have right here\ngiving me the whole idea of\n\n369\n00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:27.290\nwhat my web technology looks\nlike to someone on the outside.\n\n370\n00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:30.720\nSo this is just to kind of give\nyou that kind of spiel on it.\n\n371\n00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.580\nYou decide to go along with it,\nyou know, your thing.\n\n372\n00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.280\nAnd on top of stuff like this.\n\n373\n00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.320\nSo, that's just Maltego.\n\n374\n00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:43.870\nOther tools that you might actually\nfactor in, we mentioned Nmap before.\n\n375\n00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.180\nWe know what the deal is that.\n\n376\n00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.670\nWe also have tools like Burp Suite.\n\n377\n00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:54.150\nBurp Suite was another one that you\ncould use as a proxy between your web\n\n378\n00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:57.410\nbrowser and the site and you could analyze\nthe headers that go back and forth.\n\n379\n00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.210\nThat's tremendously valuable\nas a web developer.\n\n380\n00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:04.200\nSo if you're setting up a web service and\nyou wanna see what's being spit back and\n\n381\n00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.690\nforth between a client application and\n\n382\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.150\nthe actual service,\nyou can see that right away.\n\n383\n00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:14.890\nIt will start saying back and forth,\nhey this is what's being seen.\n\n384\n00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:19.040\nYou can even go through and edit those\nthings and see how it responds to it.\n\n385\n00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.540\nAnd then if you wanna explore another\nclass of tools, just throw those in.\n\n386\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.320\nThere's things like,\nanother class of tools is our fuzzers,\n\n387\n00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.270\nour fuzzers will try different\nranges of values to see\n\n388\n00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:35.290\nif someone can crash a server or\na web application and so you have that.\n\n389\n00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.700\nAnd then don't forget Metasploit.\n\n390\n00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.170\nWe did a whole series on Metasploit.\n\n391\n00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:44.810\nMetasploit can kick your butt\npretty hard if in the right hands.\n\n392\n00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.059\nAnd so that's another great tool.\n\n393\n00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:52.047\nAnd we've only just gone through and taken\na small handful of tools off the top,\n\n394\n00:23:52.047 --> 00:23:54.966\nand said these are some\nof the ones you can use.\n\n395\n00:23:54.966 --> 00:23:58.563\nSo what I would look at is\nGrabbing some of these tools,\n\n396\n00:23:58.563 --> 00:24:02.020\ntesting them against your\npublic facing services.\n\n397\n00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.880\nSee what's revealed and then maybe\ndo your research on those things\n\n398\n00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.740\nthat are revealed,\nsee how that relates to you.\n\n399\n00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.640\nBut you should at least have the basics.\n\n400\n00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.400\nIf the basics stuff is\npart of your design,\n\n401\n00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.200\ndon't just expose something\ndirectly to the Internet.\n\n402\n00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.880\nThat's stupid to do.\n\n403\n00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.420\nThere's really no way to phrase that.\n\n404\n00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.680\nThat's just stupid and you know it.\n\n405\n00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.850\nSo don't do that.\n\n406\n00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:27.410\nThere's stuff like patching, fire walls,\nanti-virus, anti-malware, anti-spam.\n\n407\n00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.910\nThose all come into play.\n\n408\n00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:35.130\nAnd this is additional stuff on top\nof that just to make you safer and\n\n409\n00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.060\nkeep you from becoming a victim.\n\n410\n00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.080\n>> A lot of things to consider then when\nwe're setting up a web server, especially\n\n411\n00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.060\nif it's gonna be a public facing web\nserver, how we can make sure that that\n\n412\n00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.760\nthing is secure, the services that are\nrunning on that server are secure as well.\n\n413\n00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.770\n>> Yeah,\nyou have to educate yourself on it, and\n\n414\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.900\nit would also be a big part of\nthis too is, we've all been there.\n\n415\n00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:59.540\nWe've all been in the field long enough\nthat we were there in the bad old days of\n\n416\n00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.220\nthe Internet.\n\n417\n00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.870\n[LAUGH] You know, way way back.\n\n418\n00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:05.030\nAnd you had people that were\non you could put a website up.\n\n419\n00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.770\nSo they'd put a web server someplace.\n\n420\n00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.670\nThey got a website and that was it.\n\n421\n00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:13.990\nIf you accomplished that task,\nyou were a hero to people at that point.\n\n422\n00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.600\nWithout any.\n\n423\n00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.790\nBut the thing is is that just doing\n\n424\n00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:22.410\nthat was just like swimming with sharks\nwhen you have a nice cut on you.\n\n425\n00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.250\nSomething bad is going to happen.\n\n426\n00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.270\nSo nowadays you can't get away with that.\n\n427\n00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:30.610\nSo when people do do that sort of thing,\nwhich still happens,\n\n428\n00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:34.390\nthey put a server out there,\nthey become a victim very, very quickly.\n\n429\n00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:39.210\nSo learn your technology, really learn and\nstudy up on it before you\n\n430\n00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:43.250\ndecide just throw it to the wolves and\ncause yourself all sorts of headaches.\n\n431\n00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.830\n>> All right, good.\n\n432\n00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:44.750\nAll right, well.\n\n433\n00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.380\nAgain, a lot of great information\non securing our web servers and\n\n434\n00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.000\nthe services that are running\non those web servers.\n\n435\n00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.680\nSo Sean, anything else we\nwanna toss into this episode?\n\n436\n00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.870\n>> No, I think we've got it.\n\n437\n00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.570\nI mean, we talked about the design stuff,\n\n438\n00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:01.160\nbut mainly we focussed on how\nto gather the information.\n\n439\n00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.200\nThe idea here is that we can tell\nall these sorts of design tips and\n\n440\n00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.020\ntricks to do but seeing, you know,\n\n441\n00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:12.750\nwhat someone can view about you just\nwith a few simple button clicks.\n\n442\n00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.040\nThat kind of helps you figure out,\n\n443\n00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.170\nyou know where you're gonna\nguide your design and so\n\n444\n00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:20.230\nthat was really the goal here is that you\nknow some of the design stuff already.\n\n445\n00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.770\nIt's just now what are you going to do.\n\n446\n00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.380\nThis is the information that's exposed,\nwhat are you going to do with those\n\n447\n00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.410\nthings plus other stuff you\nknow to protect yourself.\n\n448\n00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:27.980\n>> Very good.\n\n449\n00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.850\nAll right.\nWell ladies and\n\n450\n00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:29.970\ngentlemen that's going to do it for\nthis one.\n\n451\n00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.450\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n452\n00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.640\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n453\n00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.460\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n454\n00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.909\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n455\n00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:41.690\n[SOUND]\n\n",

am your host Mike Rodrick and\nhere with me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:16.281\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:17.420\n<< I am doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.000\nHow are you doing?\n<< I cannot complain.\n\n7\n00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.200\nHere we are doing another episode of our\nComp TIA Advanced security practitioner.\n\n8\n00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.730\nAnd in this episode, Sean, we're gonna\nbe talking about distributed and\n\n9\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.880\nshared computing and in particular\nin this one, enterprise security.\n\n10\n00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.150\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of things\nthat we have happen here.\n\n11\n00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.740\nWe talk about enterprise security and\nthis whole idea of shared computing.\n\n12\n00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.750\nlet's just summarize it,\nI think it would be a good thing to do.\n\n13\n00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.610\nWhere we're headed with this.\n\n14\n00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.720\nWe're talking about enterprise security,\n\n15\n00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.580\nwe're not just talking about\nthe policies on a large scale.\n\n16\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.810\nOf course that's part of it,\nthe technologies, networks, and polices,\n\n17\n00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.870\nall that go on at a large scale.\n\n18\n00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.310\nSpecifically we're going to have\na focus here, this episode and\n\n19\n00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.120\nthe next few episodes,\non the enterprise security issue plus\n\n20\n00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.870\nthings like specifically virtualization\nwhich is a big, big thing.\n\n21\n00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.760\nAnd then of course the really\nbig thing we've got to address\n\n22\n00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.200\nis cloud security and\ncloud computing, period.\n\n23\n00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.040\nBecause that's something that\nit's in your environment today.\n\n24\n00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.960\nAnd for most people, it's in their\nenvironment today I guess to be fair and\n\n25\n00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.170\nif it's not there, it's probably\ngoing to be there pretty soon.\n\n26\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.170\nIt's like the cloud is coming.\n\n27\n00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.430\nIt's on the horizon.\n\n28\n00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.020\nSo two levels so\nyeah we're dealing with that radar.\n\n29\n00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.370\nIt's definitely something that's making\nits way into your environment if it hasn't\n\n30\n00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.590\nalready.\n\n31\n00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.650\nI was just talking to Mike, I couldn't\nfind the exact number of companies or\n\n32\n00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.891\nstatistics on how many\ncompanies have moved to or\n\n33\n00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:59.926\nincorporate some sort of cloud\ntechnology in their environment.\n\n34\n00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:05.970\nBut, it's got to be quite high now, or\n\n35\n00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.800\nquite middle of the road\nat the very least.\n\n36\n00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.400\nAnd, only going to increase.\n\n37\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.480\nSo when you look at that,\nplus virtualization,\n\n38\n00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.060\nwhich has had longer legs and been around\na lot longer than Cloud computing has.\n\n39\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.460\nThat's already well-made its\nway to every environment.\n\n40\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.230\nHow many environments do you know\nthat don't have at least some form\n\n41\n00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.850\nof virtualization in it?\n\n42\n00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.230\nYou know and then we have all\nthe other enterprise security issues,\n\n43\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.150\nyou know kind of layered on top of that\nstuff, you know we've addressed a previous\n\n44\n00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.550\nepisode stuff that you've already seen,\nprobably in your day to day IT work.\n\n45\n00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.060\nYou know, so a lot of things happening\nhere to take care of and keep track of.\n\n46\n00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.730\n>> Absolutely, so where do we even start?\n\n47\n00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.280\nIt just seems like it's\na overwhelming at times.\n\n48\n00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.540\n>> Yeah,\nit's a lot of layers going on here.\n\n49\n00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.080\nIf you don't get it right,\nI can't help but\n\n50\n00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.080\nthink with all these layers of things, one\non top of the other, and all these issues\n\n51\n00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.900\ncoming into play when you're talking\nabout something like enterprise security.\n\n52\n00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.790\nThink of a game of Jenga.\n\n53\n00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.560\nIt's like, one thing's got to be out\nof position man and that's going down.\n\n54\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.540\nSo where do you start?\n\n55\n00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.400\nAt the fundamental levels of enterprise\nsecurity, it's really just talking\n\n56\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.310\nabout doing proper planning and\nassessments, risk assessments,\n\n57\n00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.900\nwhich is a topic that we're going\nto get to later on down the road.\n\n58\n00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.460\nBut that's something that does come\ninto play, so you've got to plan,\n\n59\n00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.950\nfigure out where you're going, and\nonce you've got that plan in place,\n\n60\n00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.020\nand what you need to support, that's part\nof your governance, I'd like to say,\n\n61\n00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.360\nis you have that whole idea of what\nthe governance is going to be and\n\n62\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.900\nwhat your technology supports,\nthen you start\n\n63\n00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.560\nfiguring out where security\ncomes in on that whole picture.\n\n64\n00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.420\nAnd as it's been said before in other\nplaces and we'll state it again here for\n\n65\n00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.410\nthe record, you got to plan security\nin from the very beginning.\n\n66\n00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.050\nIf you're going to do it\nthe best possible way.\n\n67\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.215\nI mean that's not always\nthe way it's going to happen.\n\n68\n00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:12.095\nI'm not going to kid and\nyou're not going to kid you on that.\n\n69\n00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:16.915\nBecause you can't always say, well I'm\ngoing to plan security from the beginning,\n\n70\n00:04:16.915 --> 00:04:20.285\nand if I don't, well what you going to do,\njust tear it out and start from scratch?\n\n71\n00:04:20.285 --> 00:04:21.435\nOf course not.\n\n72\n00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:25.930\nYou're going to do what you can\nwith the situation that exists and\n\n73\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.160\nsee what you can to weave it in\nas best you can to the fabric of\n\n74\n00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.830\nthe technology and\nenvironment that's there.\n\n75\n00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.980\nSo you got the technology.\n\n76\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.300\nYou've got what the business is doing.\n\n77\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.340\nDoes the technology support that?\n\n78\n00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.700\nSo all that planning goes into that.\n\n79\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.380\nThen you go security and\nthen you have to have things like,\n\n80\n00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.310\nin addition to the technology,\nyou have to have policies that say\n\n81\n00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.330\nhow the human element's going to interact\nwith it so that comes in to play.\n\n82\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.430\nAnd then somewhere along the road any\n\n83\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.860\nsort of legal issues are also goin\ngto come into play there too.\n\n84\n00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.500\nWe don't exactly know where that\nmight come into play on you.\n\n85\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.590\nHopefully if you get your wish here and\n\n86\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.580\nget the ideal situation,\nsomeone has dealt you a winning hand, and\n\n87\n00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.400\nyou get to deal with it\nright at the beginning.\n\n88\n00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.320\nCompany's starting,\nyou're laying your plans and all that.\n\n89\n00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.891\nAnd you've got the legal issues right\nthere that you have to deal with.\n\n90\n00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:25.869\nBut you know how that works, not only is\nthat probably not realistic that you're\n\n91\n00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:29.613\ngoing to get all those legal issues\nhanded to you right at the beginning, nor\n\n92\n00:05:29.613 --> 00:05:33.241\nare you probably going to be able to do\nthe planning at the very beginning in\n\n93\n00:05:33.241 --> 00:05:34.580\nevery case.\n\n94\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.710\nEven if you were handed the legal\nissues at the very beginning,\n\n95\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.900\nthe reality is that those things change.\n\n96\n00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.830\nYou know it seems like,\nyou know, in some cases,\n\n97\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.870\nalmost every other day,\nlegal issues seem to change.\n\n98\n00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.720\nOr they bring another one to play.\n\n99\n00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.030\nAll it takes is really, when you\nare talking about enterprise security and\n\n100\n00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.820\nlegal issues and other security\nissues is it takes one good attack or\n\n101\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.226\none good attempted attack.\n\n102\n00:05:59.226 --> 00:06:02.100\nAnd, there's going to be a lot of things\nshaken up and they're going to say,\n\n103\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.320\nwhat do we have to do to fix this?\n\n104\n00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.470\n>> All of a sudden the money\nbecomes a little more available,\n\n105\n00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.120\nthe capital is there to maybe to\nstart fixing and securing things.\n\n106\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.730\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n107\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.060\nThat's something that the piggy bank and\nthe wallets seems to open,\n\n108\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.500\ncheckbooks all seem to open at that point,\nwhich is worthwhile\n\n109\n00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.760\nto bring that into this picture as well\nbecause when you really get down to it.\n\n110\n00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.070\nAre really starting to get down\nto some of the big issues here.\n\n111\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.010\nOne of the other big issues is\nthat comp t is going to look for.\n\n112\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:34.650\nAnd you should very well be expected to as\na CASP and is going up above this as well.\n\n113\n00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.590\nIs you have to manage this stuff\nfigure out where you're going, and\n\n114\n00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.810\nyou're going to have to fight for budgets\nand figure out how to allocate budgets and\n\n115\n00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.230\nhow to get the most bank for the buck.\n\n116\n00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.850\nAnybody can get really,\nreally good security, not infallible,\n\n117\n00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.180\nthat perfect force field\naround everything.\n\n118\n00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.060\nYou can't get that.\n\n119\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.870\nWe know that.\n\n120\n00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.596\nBut if you have unlimited funds,\nyou can do quite a bit.\n\n121\n00:06:58.596 --> 00:07:01.090\nYou ain't going to get unlimited funds,\nno one has unlimited funds\n\n122\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.330\neven though it seems like it, not even\nthe government has unlimited funds.\n\n123\n00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.900\nIt does get, the speaker does\nget turned off now and then.\n\n124\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.700\nSo, your going to have to figure\nout how to best allocate that.\n\n125\n00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.710\nThat both within the sense of\nif they give you that budget,\n\n126\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.310\nhow are you going to use it\nto reach your security needs,\n\n127\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.700\nas well as making sure you get your\nbudget for what you need next year and\n\n128\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.690\nthe year after that and what happens when\nthat company that's selling product,\n\n129\n00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.650\nall of sudden says, hey,\nwe're not selling enough product.\n\n130\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.130\nWell, you've got some money left over and\ntake that and shove it over here.\n\n131\n00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.320\nAnd I don't hear you.\n\n132\n00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.050\nI don't hear you and\nsecurity's not an issue.\n\n133\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.510\nAll those things are going to\ncome into enterprise security and\n\n134\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.780\nwe're still just scratching\nthe surface on it.\n\n135\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.420\nYou could really add to this a lot.\n\n136\n00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.130\n>> And\nthe cloud solves all our problems I think.\n\n137\n00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.640\nWe just put it up in the cloud\nwe should be good to go.\n\n138\n00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.942\n>> Oh yeah.\nThat's the big, what's the saying,\n\n139\n00:07:50.942 --> 00:07:52.409\nthe elephant in the room?\n\n140\n00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:57.521\nThat's the big thing is that Is nowadays,\n\n141\n00:07:57.521 --> 00:08:01.400\nthat new buzzword is the cloud.\n\n142\n00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.580\nThey like talking the cloud this and\ncloud that.\n\n143\n00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.940\nBefore that it was virtualization and\nany number of other buzzwords before.\n\n144\n00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.040\nIt was hey, we need to have that.\n\n145\n00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.600\nSo, one of the things you are gonna have\nto address as part of your enterprise\n\n146\n00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.440\nsecurity issue is addressing that,\nI almost wanna say,\n\n147\n00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.450\ninevitable introduction of\nthe cloud into your environment.\n\n148\n00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.310\nIf it's not there, it will be there.\n\n149\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.030\nAnd you already know,\nprobably a lot of you already know,\n\n150\n00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.920\njust from general IT stuff,\nthe issues that you have with the could.\n\n151\n00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.110\nWe could go on and on and on about that,\nhow that impacts enterprise security.\n\n152\n00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.551\nYou can have all these nicely\nlaid plans and mechanisms and\n\n153\n00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:46.174\nstuff in place to have\nwhat you might perceive or\n\n154\n00:08:46.174 --> 00:08:49.998\nclose to perceiving it\nas a well-oiled machine.\n\n155\n00:08:49.998 --> 00:08:53.980\nWe'll say it's a well-oiled\nmachine to be fair.\n\n156\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.460\nBut, let's just say that you got a thing\nrunning the way you're supposed to, and\n\n157\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.710\nsomeone says, hey, guess what?\n\n158\n00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.350\nWe heard about the cloud.\n\n159\n00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.210\nWe're gonna bring that in.\n\n160\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.100\nWhat does that do?\n\n161\n00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.845\nThat throws a big monkey\nwrench into everything, and\n\n162\n00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:07.103\nnow you got to figure\nout incorporate that.\n\n163\n00:09:07.103 --> 00:09:14.590\nJust from a general IT sense,\nhow many issues can we bring up on that?\n\n164\n00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.650\nYou don't have your date\nin your control anymore.\n\n165\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.380\nIt's somewhere off site.\n\n166\n00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.020\nYou don't know really where it is.\n\n167\n00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.170\nYou know it's via the ISP or\n\n168\n00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.430\nthe cloud service provider, specifically\nhas it, but where is that hosted?\n\n169\n00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.129\nYou can't point to a box someplace.\n\n170\n00:09:31.129 --> 00:09:34.575\nAnd in some cases,\nthose boxes or that bubble,\n\n171\n00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:40.110\nwhatever you want to call it, that's\nhosted on may be somewhere overseas.\n\n172\n00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.400\nSo now you have those\nissues kind of creeping in.\n\n173\n00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.140\nSo there's a lot of things that come\ninto play just from an IT sense.\n\n174\n00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.843\nYou have to keep connectivity,\n\n175\n00:09:49.843 --> 00:09:53.220\nwhat do you do if you have\na problem getting access to it?\n\n176\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.450\nYou just can't go in and\nchange something like you could before, or\n\n177\n00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.370\ngive a server a good swift kick,\nand hope it fixes it.\n\n178\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:06.270\nYou're depending on someone else to be\non their game to really make that work.\n\n179\n00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.168\nAnd I can't tell you how\nmany IT administrators have,\n\n180\n00:10:10.168 --> 00:10:15.761\nI've at least encountered and talked to,\nover I could say just the past year,\n\n181\n00:10:15.761 --> 00:10:20.169\nthat have told me about stories\nwhere they've had to deal with\n\n182\n00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:25.037\nsupporting contractors on site\nthat couldn't support the stuff.\n\n183\n00:10:25.037 --> 00:10:28.475\nThey were having to tell them,\nhey, this is how this works, and\n\n184\n00:10:28.475 --> 00:10:31.130\nnow they're not even in\nthe building anymore.\n\n185\n00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.167\nThey can't just walk over there and smack\nthem on the back of the head and say,\n\n186\n00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:35.065\nthis isn't working.\n\n187\n00:10:35.065 --> 00:10:36.580\nYou're doing it the wrong way.\n\n188\n00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.500\nThat person's on the other side of the\ncountry or in another country altogether.\n\n189\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.510\nYou just can't do that.\n\n190\n00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.130\nYou just can't go over there and\ndeal with that anymore.\n\n191\n00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.730\nYou're at their mercy, and many companies\nhave found that out the hard way that,\n\n192\n00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.790\nthat's something that is gonna be a big,\nbig problem.\n\n193\n00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.360\nCloud seems nice on the surface\n\n194\n00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.510\nfrom an IT standpoint cuz you can\noffload your stuff to somebody else.\n\n195\n00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.138\nAnd you can pay a fee for it.\n\n196\n00:11:03.138 --> 00:11:06.853\nAnd even though you're paying a fee, it's\ncheaper than maintaining and purchasing,\n\n197\n00:11:06.853 --> 00:11:10.110\nupgrading, and doing all that training,\nall that other stuff.\n\n198\n00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.550\nBut there are hidden costs and\n\n199\n00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:17.540\nhidden things that you may not\nbe able to quantify, exactly.\n\n200\n00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.410\nI mean, how do you quantify if\nyou can't talk to someone that's\n\n201\n00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.630\nin another country.\n\n202\n00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.406\nThat there may be a language barrier,\na time change difference,\n\n203\n00:11:30.406 --> 00:11:32.340\nall those things come into play.\n\n204\n00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.080\nHow are you gonna deal with that?\n\n205\n00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.215\nAnd that's just the IT stuff.\n\n206\n00:11:36.215 --> 00:11:39.060\nNow you bring in the security\nstuff into play.\n\n207\n00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.945\nWhat if your data,\nis it hosted in another country?\n\n208\n00:11:43.965 --> 00:11:45.485\nYou may not be allowed to do that.\n\n209\n00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:47.055\nHave you asked the right questions?\n\n210\n00:11:47.055 --> 00:11:54.775\nWhen you were going to buy that cloud\nsolution, did you ask where is my data?\n\n211\n00:11:54.775 --> 00:11:57.275\nNot a lot of companies ask that.\n\n212\n00:11:57.275 --> 00:11:59.005\nWhere's your data being hosted?\n\n213\n00:11:59.005 --> 00:12:05.040\nIf you're outsourcing it, if nothing\nsays it has to be in this country just\n\n214\n00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.140\nwhen they're providing it to you, you're\nthe one that's responsible for asking, and\n\n215\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:15.240\nfirst of all knowing, if it has to be\noverseas or if it can be overseas or not.\n\n216\n00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.904\nAnd then on top of that,\nnot only knowing where they're hosting it,\n\n217\n00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:21.140\nknowing if you're allowed to do that.\n\n218\n00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.900\nYou work for not just the U.S.\ngovernment, but\n\n219\n00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.990\nreally a lot of different government\nagencies and even just private companies.\n\n220\n00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.392\nThey are regulated, or\n\n221\n00:12:30.392 --> 00:12:35.100\nthere's certain laws in place that say\nthey can't put those things overseas.\n\n222\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.552\nThey're strictly barred from doing that,\nand\n\n223\n00:12:38.552 --> 00:12:42.650\nISPs try all sorts of tricky\nthings to get around that.\n\n224\n00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:47.978\nI've seen tricks where they said,\nwell, what we're gonna do is,\n\n225\n00:12:47.978 --> 00:12:52.839\nthey say the law says well,\nit has to be managed by nationals of\n\n226\n00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:58.290\nthe country where the company is in,\nor that government is in.\n\n227\n00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.990\nAnd, there's a little loophole there.\n\n228\n00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:04.120\nSounds like, oh, it has to be host\nby nationals from that country.\n\n229\n00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.930\nYeah, nothing says that those\nnationals can't be put on a plane and\n\n230\n00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.670\nput some place where everything's\ncheaper and less regulated.\n\n231\n00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.620\nSo that was a loophole they found.\n\n232\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.750\nSay, oh yeah, they're hosted by U.S.\n\n233\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.160\nNationals or British Nationals like,\noh, that sounds great.\n\n234\n00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.594\nWhoa, whoa, wait, what, where are they?\n\n235\n00:13:20.594 --> 00:13:21.532\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n236\n00:13:21.532 --> 00:13:22.947\n>> These guys could be in several\n\n237\n00:13:22.947 --> 00:13:25.560\nplaces on the planet and\nstill meet that requirement.\n\n238\n00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.720\nSo they had to tighten up those\nrequirements to say no, no,\n\n239\n00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.931\nit can't be that way.\n\n240\n00:13:29.931 --> 00:13:32.847\nAnd then, heck, you may like the cloud and\n\n241\n00:13:32.847 --> 00:13:36.700\nreally wanna leverage\nthe benefits of the cloud.\n\n242\n00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.570\nBut the law says\n\n243\n00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.910\nthat you have very specific requirements\nto meet within your industry.\n\n244\n00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.920\nThe one that I think\nof is just healthcare.\n\n245\n00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.460\nHealthcare, they have their own\nthings with HIPAA coming in to play\n\n246\n00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.910\nthat you have to consider.\n\n247\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.024\nAnd it sounds like, well,\nthere is expertise already embedded and\n\n248\n00:13:58.024 --> 00:14:02.011\nexisting that you can leverage to\nfind out what you've got to do.\n\n249\n00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:07.940\nBut that's only a partial credit\nanswer if I can put it that way.\n\n250\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.010\nThe thing to look at there is,\nfor example, for\n\n251\n00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:16.650\nsomething like, I use an example in\none of the previous courses we did,\n\n252\n00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.690\nabout a health care company I\nwas aware of in California.\n\n253\n00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:25.157\nThat wanted to go to a cloud solution\nbecause they wanted to leverage that\n\n254\n00:14:25.157 --> 00:14:29.041\nbenefit of having shared computing and\nshared access to data,\n\n255\n00:14:29.041 --> 00:14:30.665\nwhat we expect with that.\n\n256\n00:14:30.665 --> 00:14:34.500\nThe problem was was that being in\nCalifornia, they had HIPAA guidelines.\n\n257\n00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.412\nAnd they had the state\nguidelines that came into play,\n\n258\n00:14:37.412 --> 00:14:40.721\nplus a few other things that came\nin with privacy and all that.\n\n259\n00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:44.540\nAnd it was a nightmare for\nthe people setting it up.\n\n260\n00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:49.640\nThey spent a small fraction of the year or\ntwo on that project,\n\n261\n00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.980\nI think it was actually a year\nto set up that project.\n\n262\n00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.920\nA small time of it actually\nimplementing the technology,\n\n263\n00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.060\nthe bulk of that time was\nsitting with lawyers and\n\n264\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.230\nother experts to figure out what\nthe solution was gonna look like.\n\n265\n00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.042\nI mean it's crazy.\n\n266\n00:15:01.042 --> 00:15:02.760\nI mean,\nthat's what you're gonna have to deal with\n\n267\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.660\nat the enterprise security level,\njust when talking about the cloud.\n\n268\n00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.230\nWe haven't talked about\nany other stuff yet.\n\n269\n00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.700\n>> Right, and then it seems like I see\nbusinesses thinking, well, if I put my\n\n270\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.730\ndata out there in the cloud, I don't\nhave to worry about disaster recovery.\n\n271\n00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.600\nI don't have to worry about\nproviding fault tolerance or\n\n272\n00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.050\nsometimes even backing up my data because\nthe cloud's gonna handle all that.\n\n273\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.474\nAnd that's not quite the case right?\n\n274\n00:15:24.474 --> 00:15:26.602\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, they have the nice\npuffy cloud out there, and\n\n275\n00:15:26.602 --> 00:15:29.269\nthey want to lay their head on it and\ngo, oh, everything's all better.\n\n276\n00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:31.232\nWell, quite frankly, it's not.\n\n277\n00:15:31.232 --> 00:15:36.189\nIf you think that,\nthat's the way it's gonna work,\n\n278\n00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:41.367\nyou probably need to really\nrevisit what the cloud is and\n\n279\n00:15:41.367 --> 00:15:46.784\nhow it works because it definitely\ndoes not work that way.\n\n280\n00:15:46.784 --> 00:15:51.409\nRealistically, when you buy a cloud\nsolution, you have to assume\n\n281\n00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:56.126\nthat they're giving you just the very\nbasic that they can give you.\n\n282\n00:15:56.126 --> 00:16:00.800\nAssume any of those extra bells and\nwhistles that you want, or need,\n\n283\n00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.717\nto have It's safer you just assume\nthey're not there until you verified\n\n284\n00:16:05.717 --> 00:16:08.710\nwith them directly that they're there.\n\n285\n00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:14.590\nI will even go as far I might be\na little bit biased on this thing.\n\n286\n00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:18.720\nWhen I look at but I would say when I want\nto talk to a salesperson, I tend to say,\n\n287\n00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.710\nokay, I don't trust what you're saying,\ndo you have a technical?\n\n288\n00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.170\nPerson that could really\nanswer these questions.\n\n289\n00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:29.490\nIt's not a ding against salespeople,\n\n290\n00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.490\nit's that a lot of them don't\ncome from a technical background.\n\n291\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:37.100\nThey're sell sell sell, you ask those\nquestions, they're either reading off\n\n292\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.230\nthe script or they don't really know\nhow to interpret your stuff, and\n\n293\n00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:45.970\nso it's probably better just to get a hold\nof if you have those hard technical\n\n294\n00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.670\nquestions to ask to get someone on their\nside that knows it to ask those questions.\n\n295\n00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.590\nSee what is provided and\n\n296\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.880\nthen figure out what additional\nthings you need to provide.\n\n297\n00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.030\nBecause there's requirements for\n\n298\n00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.600\nsome laws out there that you have\nto provide the ability to do.\n\n299\n00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.460\nThat you not only have to provide\nthe disaster recovery stuff\n\n300\n00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.430\nthat you mentioned.\n\n301\n00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:06.810\nThat's not necessarily always considered.\n\n302\n00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.860\nJust because it's out on the Cloud doesn't\nmean they have any responsibility to back\n\n303\n00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:10.990\nit up necessarily.\n\n304\n00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.940\n>> Or the fact that they're\nnot immune to failures, right?\n\n305\n00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.170\nI mean Amazon has had an outage, which\ncaused some down time for customers, and\n\n306\n00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.070\nyou think, I don't have to worry\nabout anything it's Amazon.\n\n307\n00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.400\nThey got enough, they have outages,\n\n308\n00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.310\nthere was another one I read\nabout where they made a mistake,\n\n309\n00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:28.190\nit was a cloud provider, made a mistake\nin their system administration.\n\n310\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.840\nEnded up wiping out all their customer\ndata and that company ended up going out\n\n311\n00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.740\nof business, but, these customers thought,\nwell my data's safe, it's in the Cloud.\n\n312\n00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:40.430\nThese people have give me an SLA that\ngives me this percentage of up time and\n\n313\n00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.740\nall this protection.\n\n314\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.570\nThat doesn't mean it's guaranteed, right?\n\n315\n00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:48.460\nSo, you still have to provide for disaster\nrecovery, backup, things like that.\n\n316\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.330\n>> You have to ask these questions.\n\n317\n00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:54.160\nIf you don't, you may end up with\na solution where all they're providing is\n\n318\n00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.370\nthat shim as they like to say,\njust that platform, like hey,\n\n319\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.490\nhere's some space for you to move in.\n\n320\n00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:04.180\nIt's kind of like they gave you just\na building with a bunch of rooms in there\n\n321\n00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.280\nand saying, that room's yours.\n\n322\n00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.360\nIf you need anything, let us know.\n\n323\n00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.350\nIf you don't know about these other\nlittle things that need to be provided,\n\n324\n00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:17.670\nlike fire suppression, desks and power and\n\n325\n00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:23.210\nall those basic things,\nyou're not necessarily gonna include them.\n\n326\n00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.020\nSo, you have to ask when\nyou go to a cloud provider,\n\n327\n00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.030\ndo you provide disaster recovery?\n\n328\n00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.060\nThat's gonna be a big one.\n\n329\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.190\nDo you back it up?\n\n330\n00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.510\nYou do not want to find\nout after the fact,\n\n331\n00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.960\nthat's the wrong time\nto find out about it.\n\n332\n00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.920\nGet this checklist going,\nthat's one of the primary things.\n\n333\n00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:45.540\nThen ask them what type of security\nmeasure do you have in place?\n\n334\n00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.480\nCan I encrypt my stuff up there and\nwho has the key?\n\n335\n00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.120\nThat's one that may not\neven cross your mind.\n\n336\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.680\nI mean think about it.\n\n337\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.030\nWhen you go to a cloud provider and\nthey say, oh yeah,\n\n338\n00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:01.790\nwe provide encryption for your stuff.\n\n339\n00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.260\nIt's this level and all that stuff.\n\n340\n00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.160\nAll the good stuff we talked about\nduring our first section of a cast.\n\n341\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.670\nWe talked about all these fancy\nencryption standards and all that.\n\n342\n00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.060\nOkay, well that's all well and good.\n\n343\n00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.750\nWhat about the question of\nwho's got a hold of the key.\n\n344\n00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.270\nAnd if they've got a hold of\nthe key which it's not unheard of.\n\n345\n00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:22.310\nIn fact, it's fairly common\nif they provide that service.\n\n346\n00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.970\nOr you pay for that service,\nthat they encrypt this stuff for you and\n\n347\n00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:26.980\nhold the key.\n\n348\n00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.400\nIf they hold the key, guess what?\n\n349\n00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.862\nGovernment can come to them directly and\nsay, you know what,\n\n350\n00:19:31.862 --> 00:19:34.602\nwe want access to their data,\ngive us their key.\n\n351\n00:19:34.602 --> 00:19:37.829\nThey don't have to tell you\nthat's actually happened.\n\n352\n00:19:37.829 --> 00:19:40.136\nThey may be instructed not to tell you.\n\n353\n00:19:40.136 --> 00:19:45.022\nSo, if privacy is really important to you,\nwhich it should be, and\n\n354\n00:19:45.022 --> 00:19:49.825\nyou are dealing with maybe for\nexample the public that wants to make\n\n355\n00:19:49.825 --> 00:19:54.712\nsure that their stuff is being kept\nprivate, you may wanna go with,\n\n356\n00:19:54.712 --> 00:20:00.332\nyeah it's key-estro, that's the actual\nformal term for it, good catch.\n\n357\n00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:03.374\nBut, if you wanna see how\nthat's actually handled,\n\n358\n00:20:03.374 --> 00:20:08.140\nbecause some ISPs they'll take\npossession of the key and that's theirs.\n\n359\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:14.630\nThen there's other ones that will\nactually give you control of the key.\n\n360\n00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.410\nThere was one Cloud Source\nprovider actually made a big\n\n361\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.140\ndeal about this because they were seen.\n\n362\n00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.890\nNow subpoenas were coming up and\nto different providers, and\n\n363\n00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.310\nI think they'd actually got a couple\nbefore they said, you know what,\n\n364\n00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.840\nwe don't feel comfortable\nwith the fact that we\n\n365\n00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.330\nhave to not comply with the subpoena,\nwhich they were fine with doing that.\n\n366\n00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.950\nBut, they didn't or\nweren't supposed to tell the customer,\n\n367\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.490\nin fact they weren't supposed\nto tell the customer.\n\n368\n00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:47.430\nThat customer was basically assuming\neverything was running on all cylinders,\n\n369\n00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:48.920\nwith no problem.\n\n370\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.860\nAnd so, meanwhile they have chunk of\ntheir data being taken and decrypted and\n\n371\n00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.525\nanalyzed without their knowledge.\n\n372\n00:20:55.525 --> 00:20:58.700\nSo, this company did was is they\nsaid we're gonna switch that,\n\n373\n00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.670\nwe're still gonna provide it encrypts\nservices like we always have.\n\n374\n00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.080\nBut, the key is gonna be in your hands.\n\n375\n00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.240\nSo, the only way anyone can ever get\naccess to your data is if they come\n\n376\n00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.180\ndirectly to you.\n\n377\n00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.900\nThey can't come to us as the service\nprovider, because we don't have the key.\n\n378\n00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.680\nAll we know is there is a big jumble of\nones and zeros sitting over there that\n\n379\n00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:23.320\nlook confusing and don't mean anything to\nus cuz we don't know how to decrypt it.\n\n380\n00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.040\nAnd so that's how they solve that.\n\n381\n00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.980\nThat's something that you may want to mix\ninto your solution because it gives you\n\n382\n00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.830\nmore control over your information.\n\n383\n00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.860\nAnd that's so\nyou have the encryption part of it and\n\n384\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.560\nthen we talk about disaster recovery.\n\n385\n00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.370\nOne of the thing I'd throw into that,\non top of where it's being hosted,\n\n386\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:47.102\none of the thing comes on top of that,\nthat whole mix there is,\n\n387\n00:21:47.102 --> 00:21:54.120\nsometimes in this regulation is asking for\nthe ability to do forensics.\n\n388\n00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:00.580\nWe did our whole series on forensics.\n\n389\n00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:05.100\nIt was, we saw all this cool stuff and\neverything, but they've got forensics.\n\n390\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.460\nThey've got it well-fleshed out for\nthings like tablets, PCs and\n\n391\n00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.820\nservers and stuff like that, Webster,\n\n392\n00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:16.140\nall the things that have already been\nfleshed out and are continuing to evolve.\n\n393\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:20.590\nThey pretty much fleshed out\nthe issues with mobile devices, but\n\n394\n00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:26.655\nthat issue with the Cloud, there's really\nnot effective forensics for that yet.\n\n395\n00:22:26.655 --> 00:22:31.470\nBecause, one of the things we looked at\nwhen we were doing our forensics stuff,\n\n396\n00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:36.920\nwas we need to preserve the space on a\ndrive where data may have resided before.\n\n397\n00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.440\nWell due the way the Cloud works,\n\n398\n00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.500\nelasticity issue the way\nit reallocates stuff.\n\n399\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.860\nWho knows if your stuff that's\nsitting over here so to speak,\n\n400\n00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.200\nmaybe sitting over here and someone else's\nstuff may be sitting there overwriting it.\n\n401\n00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:56.260\nEven worse as far as security goes is not\nonly has someone overwritten this and\n\n402\n00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.690\nscrambled this data, there's no way\nto really do forensics on that.\n\n403\n00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:04.020\nThe other issue that comes into play is\nthe person that's stuff is there now,\n\n404\n00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.610\nis there any way shape or\nform that they can actually get\n\n405\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:12.350\na copy of that information\nof the actual platform.\n\n406\n00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.120\nThat's actually come into play.\n\n407\n00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.630\nSo, you have to think about that.\n\n408\n00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.850\nIf that's a concern of yours,\nthat someone else,\n\n409\n00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:24.430\nmaybe that's hosted on there may have\na situation where when stuff gets,\n\n410\n00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:28.380\njust reallocated on the Cloud,\nthat they may be able to read that space.\n\n411\n00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.010\nYou may be stuck.\n\n412\n00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.640\nYou may say, you know what?\n\n413\n00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.475\nCan't go to a Cloud Service\nprovider to do this.\n\n414\n00:23:34.475 --> 00:23:35.315\nOpen up the check books.\n\n415\n00:23:35.315 --> 00:23:37.745\nWe've gotta build one\non-premises to do this.\n\n416\n00:23:37.745 --> 00:23:38.965\nWe're stuck.\n\n417\n00:23:38.965 --> 00:23:41.525\n>> It really does open up a lot of\nquestions like when you think about\n\n418\n00:23:41.525 --> 00:23:45.285\nsomebody coming in and then let's say,\nmost of it's shared hosting, right?\n\n419\n00:23:45.285 --> 00:23:48.490\nWe're not the only one that this\ncompany is providing services for.\n\n420\n00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.730\nLet's say somebody else has\ndone something wrong and\n\n421\n00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.961\nthe authorities have to come in and\ngrab those stands.\n\n422\n00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:55.200\nWell what about my data\nthat's on his stands?\n\n423\n00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.833\nI didn't do anything wrong, but my data's\non there, and now it's gone, and so\n\n424\n00:23:58.833 --> 00:24:01.986\nI've got downtime, I'm going through\nBasically a recovery process\n\n425\n00:24:01.986 --> 00:24:04.886\nbecause I've just lost all my\nvirtual servers or what have you.\n\n426\n00:24:04.886 --> 00:24:09.725\nYou've got concerns with chains of\ncustody which are almost, it seems like,\n\n427\n00:24:09.725 --> 00:24:13.420\nimpossible to do with these\ncloud service providers.\n\n428\n00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.870\nYou got employees from the cloud service\nproviders, what if you got people that\n\n429\n00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:21.090\nare managing those actual servers\nthat are hosting our information.\n\n430\n00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.450\nThis person's working with\ncompany A's data, but\n\n431\n00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:27.780\nhe's also working with company B's data,\nis that person trustworthy?\n\n432\n00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.050\nWhat if company A pays them to\nget access to company B's data?\n\n433\n00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:33.980\nSo it really does open\nup a lot of concerns.\n\n434\n00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:39.210\n>> And you're kind of getting in\nthe area Mike, when you talk about that,\n\n435\n00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:43.830\nyou know with the shared stuff and people\nhaving access to different things, and\n\n436\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:48.020\nthe government coming in and grabbing\nstuff, what happens to your stuff?\n\n437\n00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:52.060\nWell let's say that that\nscenario does happen.\n\n438\n00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:56.960\nWhat we learned when we went through the\nwhole forensics process, the way they're\n\n439\n00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:01.830\nsupposed to do it when they serve a search\nwarrant for that or get a subpoena,\n\n440\n00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:07.670\nwhat have you, to grab the suspected\ninformation, they're supposed\n\n441\n00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:13.285\nto do their best to limit getting\nextraneous data when they collect it.\n\n442\n00:25:13.285 --> 00:25:18.860\nAnd that's not exactly how it's worded,\nbut you get the idea.\n\n443\n00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.690\nIt's like they're gonna come in and\n\n444\n00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.610\ngrab the suspected data, but if they\nhappen to get some collateral damage as\n\n445\n00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:32.180\nlong as they've done their best to limit\nit and protect the privacy of it after\n\n446\n00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:38.100\nthe fact, all's well and\ngood on my collection side.\n\n447\n00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:43.550\nAs long as I can show I've done those\nthings, I'm good, I'm out of danger.\n\n448\n00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.015\nI might get questioned, did you do it\nright, what measures did you take?\n\n449\n00:25:47.015 --> 00:25:50.215\nBut as long as the person that's\ndoing that forensic analysis or\n\n450\n00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:55.295\nextracted that data, I can show that I\ndid my best due diligence as I saw in\n\n451\n00:25:55.295 --> 00:26:00.775\nthe chat room here, as long as I've\nexercised that, then I should be okay.\n\n452\n00:26:00.775 --> 00:26:05.809\nBut on your side as a customer, and\nsomeone that may have customers yourself,\n\n453\n00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.470\nthat data technically is\nin someone else's hands.\n\n454\n00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.620\nEven if it is the government or you know,\n\n455\n00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.930\nwhat have you, it's in someone else's\nhands, so you've got to explain,\n\n456\n00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.320\nyou may very well have to explain\ndepending on the situation that, hey,\n\n457\n00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:26.180\nyou know, there was search warrant\nserved in such and such a situation.\n\n458\n00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.630\nDo you really wanna have that discussion,\neven though it didn't apply to you?\n\n459\n00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.900\nHey, there was a search warrant served and\nthey may have gotten some of our\n\n460\n00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.220\ndata as part of another investigation\nthat doesn't involve us.\n\n461\n00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.730\nThey accidentally, or whatever,\ngot some of this stuff.\n\n462\n00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:43.036\nDo you think your clients are really\ngoing to be too happy about that?\n\n463\n00:26:43.036 --> 00:26:45.450\n>> Yeah.\n\n464\n00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:48.650\n>> I know that there's a good\nnumber of them from the IT side,\n\n465\n00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:54.600\nthose of us that know IT and understand\nthe cloud, we get the issue there.\n\n466\n00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.900\nBut when you get to the other side, this\nisn't the IT issue, they're pretty much\n\n467\n00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.840\nthinking the same thing, that hey you must\nbe like whoever you're hanging out with.\n\n468\n00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.510\nSo they figure if someone got\na search warrant served to them,\n\n469\n00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.570\nwhat are you doing hanging out with them?\n\n470\n00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:11.680\nIt's like everyone went to the same\ngrocery store, I don't know if the person\n\n471\n00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.320\nin the next aisle's stealing something or\nif they're doing whatever with it.\n\n472\n00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.270\nDon't blame me because\nof that type of stuff.\n\n473\n00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:23.450\nBut, some people are, so it could\nbe a public relations problem too.\n\n474\n00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.120\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n475\n00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.910\nAnd the downtime that can be created,\njust not a good scenario.\n\n476\n00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:30.130\nSo a lot of things we gotta think about\nif we're going to be moving to the cloud,\n\n477\n00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:31.310\nand most of us are.\n\n478\n00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:37.090\nI mean it's got a lot of benefits and so\nwe just weigh the benefits with the risks\n\n479\n00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:41.410\nthat are involved, and most companies are\ngoing to cloud cuz the benefits are there.\n\n480\n00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.620\nAnd we can mitigate a lot of those risks\nas long as we know what they are and\n\n481\n00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.190\nwe see them ahead of time and\nwe know how to plan and\n\n482\n00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:50.470\ndesign our networks properly which\nis what we're learning here.\n\n483\n00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:51.870\nA lot of great information, Shawn.\n\n484\n00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.480\nAnything else we want to throw\ninto this particular episode?\n\n485\n00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.660\n>> Just a little bit here in the end,\nI would advise anybody just\n\n486\n00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.380\nthis is something that steps outside\nthe CASP, and I think it's important to do\n\n487\n00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.570\nthat wherever necessary, and this is one\nof those places where it's necessary.\n\n488\n00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.810\nIf you are in any way shape or\nform dealing with a cloud or\n\n489\n00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:15.570\nwill be dealing with a cloud, there's way\nway more issues than we could even have\n\n490\n00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:21.830\nthe time to talk about in a course\nlike this or what have you.\n\n491\n00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.000\nYou really need to familiarize\nyourself with all the fine print and\n\n492\n00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.020\ndo your research because there's\na lot of information out there, and\n\n493\n00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.770\nit's not necessarily all well organized.\n\n494\n00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:36.030\nSo really make, get yourself acquainted\nwith what your requirements are and\n\n495\n00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:40.610\nwhat's provided out there, and\nthen see where you can reconcile it and\n\n496\n00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:41.810\nsee if it's a good solution.\n\n497\n00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:46.780\nIt's okay to say no if you don't have\nthat or make the recommendation and\n\n498\n00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.580\nsay no don't do it.\n\n499\n00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.500\nI've done that plenty\nof times in my career.\n\n500\n00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.730\nPeople will get sometimes really\nupset like why are you saying no,\n\n501\n00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:55.650\nwe had all these plans.\n\n502\n00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:58.760\nYou asked my opinion,\nI said it was insecure and it was crap and\n\n503\n00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.970\nI said don't use it.\n\n504\n00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:05.480\nYou choose to go on, hey, I'm just telling\nyou what I see from where I'm sitting.\n\n505\n00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.030\n>> Very good.\n\n506\n00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.760\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nhope you enjoyed this episode.\n\n507\n00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.030\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n508\n00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:11.910\n>> And I'm Shawn Rianno.\n\n509\n00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.219\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n510\n00:29:13.219 --> 00:29:17.238\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.480\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwe're here today, Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.430\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.090\n>> Doing pretty good,\ngot my head in the clouds.\n\n6\n00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.540\n>> [LAUGH].\nHead in the clouds, that's a good\n\n7\n00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.890\nplace to be because we are doing our\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner,\n\n8\n00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.090\nand in this episode we\nare looking at cloud computing.\n\n9\n00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.537\nSo, you're right where\nyou need to be Sean.\n\n10\n00:00:27.537 --> 00:00:28.264\n>> How appropriate!\n\n11\n00:00:28.264 --> 00:00:29.890\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.027\n>> All right, so what have we got?\n\n13\n00:00:31.027 --> 00:00:32.340\nCloud computing, definitely.\n\n14\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.110\nWe've seen it In a previous episode\nwe talked a little bit about it,\n\n15\n00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.890\nwe said it was the buzz term\nin most modern networks today.\n\n16\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.780\nEverybody's talking about the cloud.\n\n17\n00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.100\nWhat do we need to be aware of about\ncloud when it comes to designing\n\n18\n00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.660\na secure network?\n\n19\n00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.813\n>> There's so many issues here and\nyou're gonna see a mixture\n\n20\n00:00:50.813 --> 00:00:57.410\nof the old types of issues you had to\ndeal with and I kinda hate to say that.\n\n21\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.190\nBut some of the traditional I guess\na better way to put it that we've had with\n\n22\n00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.860\nsecurity and design.\n\n23\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.583\nPlus a whole bunch of new ones\nthat are still being fleshed out.\n\n24\n00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:09.094\nAnd still being kind of figured\nout what they're gonna be,\n\n25\n00:01:09.094 --> 00:01:11.000\nwhich is really the tough part.\n\n26\n00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.930\nI can figure out stuff like we've\ntalked on our previous segment we've\n\n27\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.040\ntalked about, things like encryption.\n\n28\n00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.590\nThe encryption stuff has been,\nit's evolving still.\n\n29\n00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.980\nBut it's been beaten to death.\n\n30\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.340\nThey are coming up with new algorithms and\nnew strategies all the time.\n\n31\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.340\nBut we know what encryption is.\n\n32\n00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.890\nIt's a known quantity,\nit's beaten to death.\n\n33\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.995\nWe don't even have to\nworry about that too much.\n\n34\n00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:35.635\nStuff like where it's hosted,\nthat's a pretty cut and dry issue.\n\n35\n00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:39.625\nYou figure out where it's hosted and\nwhose hosting it, and all that good stuff.\n\n36\n00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:44.055\nAnd availability, all those things,\ndisaster recovery, those are known issues.\n\n37\n00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:48.515\nBut then you start figuring out when\nyou have this kind of nebulous,\n\n38\n00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:51.601\nunknown bubble out there called the Cloud.\n\n39\n00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:59.860\nHow does that impact your other\nareas like we said the legal issues\n\n40\n00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.160\nbeing one, privacy issues with your\nclients, accessibility issues for\n\n41\n00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.960\nyour clients and for you,\nhow much or how little do you buy?\n\n42\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.630\nWhat questions do you ask\nwen you are coming in?\n\n43\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.000\nDo you go totally private cloud or\ndo you go commercial?\n\n44\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.955\nWhat are you gonna host\nin the commercial cloud?\n\n45\n00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:26.043\nCuz the Cloud just isn't,\nsaying that there is a cloud in the IT\n\n46\n00:02:26.043 --> 00:02:32.008\nworld is like saying that there is only\none type of Cloud in the real world.\n\n47\n00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:34.655\nThere's not one type of cloud in the sky.\n\n48\n00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:37.185\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's one type of cloud\n\n49\n00:02:37.185 --> 00:02:37.790\nhere in Florida.\n\n50\n00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.584\nIt's called rain clouds.\n\n51\n00:02:39.584 --> 00:02:42.063\n[LAUGH] At least I've noticed that.\n\n52\n00:02:42.063 --> 00:02:47.140\nSo that's kinda where we're going is that,\nyeah, there's not just one type of thing.\n\n53\n00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.932\nSo, there's a lot of variation here and\nnew ground that's gonna have to be\n\n54\n00:02:51.932 --> 00:02:57.126\nbroken or has been broken or you're gonna\nhave to break it in your specific case.\n\n55\n00:02:57.126 --> 00:03:00.470\n>> All right, so we got different\nmodels of cloud computing.\n\n56\n00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.229\nI guess different levels of\nhow far we go into the cloud,\n\n57\n00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.295\nis that what we're talking about there?\n\n58\n00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:06.295\n>> Yeah.\n\n59\n00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:11.382\nIs what we're really king of looking\nat with these cloud models is.\n\n60\n00:03:11.382 --> 00:03:15.700\nLet's kinda spin this question just\na bit is when we talk about models,\n\n61\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.280\ntalk about really in kinda\nservices that are available.\n\n62\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.080\nIt goes back to what I said\na few moments ago is that\n\n63\n00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.950\nthere's not just one type of cloud.\n\n64\n00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.245\nYou don't just have a little\npuffy thing out there.\n\n65\n00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:32.055\nThey're drawing a diagram and that's where\nwe're putting our stuff and that's it.\n\n66\n00:03:32.055 --> 00:03:34.395\nIt's not just a question of\nwhere you're storing data.\n\n67\n00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:38.445\nA lot of people do associate it with that,\nand that's because of\n\n68\n00:03:38.445 --> 00:03:43.110\nthe consumer perception of stuff like\nMicrosoft's One Drive, and Google.\n\n69\n00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.190\nThings like Dropbox and other stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.740\nAmazon got their stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.200\nThere's a whole bunch of things out there\nthat the public sees in general and\n\n72\n00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.280\nthat's helped kind of bolster this thing\nof it's just a big thing to store data.\n\n73\n00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.870\nI mean you ask somebody that's\nnot in IT what's the cloud\n\n74\n00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.120\nthey may kind of go around different\ndirections, there's still some confusion.\n\n75\n00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.370\nBut generally they'll\ncome down to oh well,\n\n76\n00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.860\nif you give an example of Microsoft's\nOneDrive or SkyDrive, whatever they're\n\n77\n00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.180\ncalling it now, they'll say oh well\nthat's the place where I store my data.\n\n78\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.420\nThat's what they look at, but\nthat's not the only model that you have.\n\n79\n00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.540\nYou have services being provided out\nthere, in addition to just the raw space.\n\n80\n00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.916\nYou have, of course, virtualization,\nwhich we're gonna be talking about.\n\n81\n00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:35.650\nYou have things like mail services\nbeing provided out there so\n\n82\n00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.550\nyou can host your mail server\nout there Microsoft offers that\n\n83\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.480\nyou can buy what you need and\njust give that to you.\n\n84\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.870\nSo they host exchange.\n\n85\n00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.770\nThey do all that and\n\n86\n00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.250\nthey give you some access to it to\nyou the management that your in.\n\n87\n00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.230\nBut they're for on sense of purposes.\n\n88\n00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.450\nThey have the server,\nyou have the console.\n\n89\n00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.380\nEverything else outside of those things.\n\n90\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.420\nGot to define your SLA of course.\n\n91\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.740\nBut you have that.\n\n92\n00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.470\nThen you also have things like Microsoft\neven has stuff like Active Directory\n\n93\n00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.789\nhosted in the cloud.\n\n94\n00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.553\nSo you can host all kinds of, you can\nhost your Active Directory out there, or\n\n95\n00:05:13.553 --> 00:05:18.392\nhave just a little bit inside your company\nand use the federation services, or\n\n96\n00:05:18.392 --> 00:05:22.090\nwhatever, to link them together,\nyou can do that.\n\n97\n00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.750\nThen you could step of to infrastructure\nI think like firewalls and\n\n98\n00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.790\nantivirus, anti malware\nprotection in there.\n\n99\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.200\nSo you can have quite a few things\nbuilding around this cloud model.\n\n100\n00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.810\nAnd then you even have on\ntop of that whether or\n\n101\n00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.380\nnot you're gonna go with something\nthat's hosted by the people out there or\n\n102\n00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.390\nyou're gonna take care of it yourself.\n\n103\n00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.140\nThat's another spin on it.\n\n104\n00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.320\nIf your goal is to not have to take care\nof your thing like your own mail server,\n\n105\n00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.470\nand not have to worry about stuff that\ngoes on with Active Directory necessarily\n\n106\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.140\nor some of the minutia, I guess say with\nActive Directory, you probably don't want\n\n107\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.980\nyour own private cloud because that means\nyou're just, you're still hosting it.\n\n108\n00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.020\nYou're just adding a whole bunch\nof other stuff on top of it.\n\n109\n00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.000\nSo you can push it out there, and\nyou could keep going and going and\n\n110\n00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.680\ngoing with it.\n\n111\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.790\nBut the thing here would be is\nthat it's far more than just a box\n\n112\n00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.590\nthat's hosted someplace that you just put\nstuff in and come back and get it later.\n\n113\n00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.350\nIt's not just for that for syncing that\ntype of data and making it available.\n\n114\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.850\nIt's services and infrastructure and\nvarious platforms you can have.\n\n115\n00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.020\nYou can host of bunch of things up there.\n\n116\n00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.570\nAnd the list seems to be growing all\nthe time with what they're gonna do.\n\n117\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.540\nI mean all sorts of databases and\nstuff like that have gone there too.\n\n118\n00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.760\nSo you really got a lot of stuff on the\nbuffet that you can choose from to make\n\n119\n00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.620\nyour own solution and\nnot even have to worry about this stuff.\n\n120\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.508\nThis is something I see\nthat David put up here.\n\n121\n00:06:55.508 --> 00:06:58.319\nRemote process is all the rage,\neven 25,30 years ago.\n\n122\n00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.659\nI've had several friends\nthat I've talked to saying,\n\n123\n00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:07.750\nthat are in IT, that are like yeah,\nthey just renamed the stuff.\n\n124\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.390\nThat's all they did.\n\n125\n00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.172\nThey didn't create anything new.\n\n126\n00:07:09.172 --> 00:07:11.390\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> They just said, it's the Cloud.\n\n127\n00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.600\nThe price we were charging for\nthe old stuff was kinda going down hill.\n\n128\n00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.290\nPeople got used to it.\n\n129\n00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.030\nRename it.\n\n130\n00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.790\nKeep the same stuff behind the scenes and\nwe'll charge up here again.\n\n131\n00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.137\nWe'll rename it something else later.\n\n132\n00:07:22.137 --> 00:07:26.788\n>> [LAUGH] And then there's several\ndifferent providers of Cloud services?\n\n133\n00:07:26.788 --> 00:07:28.680\nThat means we're not stuck\nwith just Microsoft.\n\n134\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.660\n>> Yeah, you're definitely\nnot stuck with just them.\n\n135\n00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.498\n>> Not that being stuck with\nMicrosoft is a bad thing,\n\n136\n00:07:34.498 --> 00:07:36.785\nMicrosoft is a very good service\nprovider don't get me wrong.\n\n137\n00:07:36.785 --> 00:07:37.830\n>> Is anyone from Microsoft here?\n\n138\n00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.565\nNo.\n[LAUGH] Microsoft's just one of them, and\n\n139\n00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:45.135\nto be honest it's from what I understand.\n\n140\n00:07:45.135 --> 00:07:48.799\nIf you get behind the curtain,\nso to speak, of Microsoft,\n\n141\n00:07:48.799 --> 00:07:50.940\nit's not really them hosting it.\n\n142\n00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.039\nThey branded it.\n\n143\n00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:54.950\nIt's hosted by someone else.\n\n144\n00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.810\nI don't know who that is, and\nit's not really important.\n\n145\n00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.928\nFor here.\nBut, yeah,\n\n146\n00:07:58.928 --> 00:08:01.790\nMicrosoft has their own\nservices that they provide.\n\n147\n00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:06.230\nSo all their Exchange stuff and\nstuff like that.\n\n148\n00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:13.720\nThey offer all those things through\na third party that's branded their stuff.\n\n149\n00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.500\nBut then you also have\nGoogle out there and Amazon,\n\n150\n00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.590\nand those really, for all intents and\npurposes are the big three.\n\n151\n00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.690\nThose are the ones you're gonna run into,\nare those three providers.\n\n152\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.869\nI'm not saying there's not other\nones commercially available.\n\n153\n00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:33.560\nI'm just saying those are the ones you're\ngonna run into that are huge players\n\n154\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.070\nthere.\n\n155\n00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.780\nSo more than likely if you're ever going\nto be rolling your own or creating your\n\n156\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:44.560\nown cloud solution from scratch, you're\nprobably going to one of those big three.\n\n157\n00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.159\nYou can go with the smaller one,\nand it's not to kind of pick on,\n\n158\n00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:53.605\nor disrespect any of the smaller ones.\n\n159\n00:08:53.605 --> 00:08:57.417\nBut you've got to question\nwhen you go to a smaller one,\n\n160\n00:08:57.417 --> 00:09:01.556\nare they gonna be able to really\nscale up and meet your needs,\n\n161\n00:09:01.556 --> 00:09:05.710\nand they'll provide what you\nneed to get the job done?\n\n162\n00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:12.060\nAnd from what someone else also told\nme that does a lot of consulting\n\n163\n00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.850\ncentered on cloud services and\ndeveloping cloud-based solutions,\n\n164\n00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.000\nfrom what I've heard,\nthose providers are, those big three,\n\n165\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.230\nseem to occasionally go out and\njust gobble up one of the small ones.\n\n166\n00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.430\nSo you get a case of the big fish\nswallowing the smaller one and\n\n167\n00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.340\njust growing in size.\n\n168\n00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:36.310\nSo that happens, but when you talk about\na provider, the bigger issue here is\n\n169\n00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:41.710\nnot really to endorse any,\nis to endorse any specific provider.\n\n170\n00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.100\nThey've all got their pros,\nthey've all got their cons.\n\n171\n00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.195\nI mean, you go to somebody like Microsoft,\n\n172\n00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:54.733\nyou've got a pretty good\nconfidence there that they should\n\n173\n00:09:54.733 --> 00:10:00.491\nbe able to handle what your needs\nare because its their stuff,\n\n174\n00:10:00.491 --> 00:10:06.380\nit's their stuff,\nthey've got a lot of knowledge behind it.\n\n175\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.813\nThey've invested a lot of\nmoney in that stuff, and\n\n176\n00:10:08.813 --> 00:10:10.690\nit's going to be available globally.\n\n177\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.059\nIf you're an enterprise company, which is\nreally when we go back to the beginning,\n\n178\n00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:19.465\ntalking about enterprise company, you're\nnot somebody just sitting in one spot.\n\n179\n00:10:19.465 --> 00:10:23.260\nYou're somebody that's\ngrown way beyond that,\n\n180\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.070\neither to a country-wide size deal\nwhere you are encompassing the whole\n\n181\n00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:33.335\ncountry like the United States, Canada or\ncontinental Europe, something like that.\n\n182\n00:10:33.335 --> 00:10:37.525\nYou could be going way beyond that,\nencompassing the whole globe.\n\n183\n00:10:37.525 --> 00:10:38.355\nNow what are you gonna go with?\n\n184\n00:10:38.355 --> 00:10:43.225\nA small server cloud\nservice provider based\n\n185\n00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:48.775\nsomewhere in the US in some city and\nthat's the whole deal.\n\n186\n00:10:48.775 --> 00:10:52.600\nOr are you going to use a bigger provider?\n\n187\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.940\nI am probably going to go with somebody\nlike a Microsoft or a Google or\n\n188\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:00.260\nan Amazon that can scale with me,\nI know is going to be there, to do it.\n\n189\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.427\nI'm not saying the other\nperson won't be there.\n\n190\n00:11:02.427 --> 00:11:06.766\nI'm just saying there may be more things\nthat I'm going to need to know before\n\n191\n00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:11.140\nI get the nice warm fuzzy feeling\nsaying yea, I'm gonna go with them.\n\n192\n00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:11.730\nAnd then, also,\n\n193\n00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:16.420\nthe smaller ones may not be prepared\nto handle security the same way.\n\n194\n00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:21.590\nYou can bet you get the bigger providers,\nthey dealt with a wide range of issues,\n\n195\n00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.540\nhave greater exposure and experience.\n\n196\n00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.960\nSo they should know how to deal with\na lot of those types of things.\n\n197\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.840\nI say should, because nothing's 100%, but\n\n198\n00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.980\nthey should know how to deal\nwith these types of things.\n\n199\n00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.380\nSo make sure when you choose a provider,\n\n200\n00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:41.340\nyou know what your needs are as far\nas how large a company you are.\n\n201\n00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.580\nEnterprise level, you're going to want\nto have an enterprise-level solution.\n\n202\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:49.612\nYou may pay more for it, but in the end,\nit only takes one really bad day to kind\n\n203\n00:11:49.612 --> 00:11:55.380\nof make you re-evaluate [LAUGH] should\nyou have gone with the lowest provider.\n\n204\n00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.830\nSo, that's just kind of that.\n\n205\n00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.606\nAnd also think, by the way,\nwhen you're doing this,\n\n206\n00:12:00.606 --> 00:12:04.440\nwhat is it you're actually\nasking of the provider?\n\n207\n00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.270\nJust mentioned a cloud as\nsomething to store data in.\n\n208\n00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.360\nAnd something that you can host services\nin, or just strictly as a platform to put\n\n209\n00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.770\nyour own virtualization and\nall that stuff on it.\n\n210\n00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.881\nWhat exactly are your\nexpectations going into it?\n\n211\n00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:21.730\nCuz that's gonna knock out some of\nthose providers right off the list.\n\n212\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.410\nThey're just not gonna be\nable to help you there,\n\n213\n00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.060\nbecause they're not set\nup to do such things.\n\n214\n00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:33.760\nSo this is one of those areas\nwhere proper planning goes in.\n\n215\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.930\nI've heard it before, kind of a rule of\nthumb, that I've heard some people quote.\n\n216\n00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.928\nAs they say, about three quarters of your\ntime should be spent just the planning and\n\n217\n00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:44.280\nfleshing stuff out.\n\n218\n00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.990\nOnce you've got that and\nyou've got that all figured out,\n\n219\n00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.215\nwhat you need to do, you can build\nthe technology of that pretty quickly.\n\n220\n00:12:50.215 --> 00:12:55.100\nThat' just snapping pieces into place,\nto have the technology do this.\n\n221\n00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.670\nSo make sure you know what it is you're\ndoing because the cloud service providers,\n\n222\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.300\nlike a lot of companies, you ask for\nit, they'll sell it to you.\n\n223\n00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:09.640\nThe responsibility is on you to know\nif that's the right solution or not.\n\n224\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.250\n>> Then we look at\nthe different providers.\n\n225\n00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.270\nThere's a lot of benefits\nof going with the cloud.\n\n226\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:20.125\nSo I know there's a lot of risks involved,\nbut most people are still doing it and\n\n227\n00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:22.140\nthat's because there are some\nreally good benefits.\n\n228\n00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.050\n>> Oh yeah,\nthere's tremendous benefits, and\n\n229\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.460\nthis is what you're\ngonna have to evaluate.\n\n230\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.280\nAs that person that's building\nthe solution, as and is doing\n\n231\n00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.900\nthe enterprise security solutions is that\nfiguring out, what the benefits are.\n\n232\n00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.910\nWhat you want to avoid, and\nthis is really the tricky part and\n\n233\n00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.250\nI've seen this in the real world.\n\n234\n00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:47.459\nI've seen this brought up\nby colleagues of mine.\n\n235\n00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:52.309\nI've seen it just numerous times in\ndifferent forms, is don't just, don't just\n\n236\n00:13:52.309 --> 00:13:57.250\nlet someone push you into this because\nhey, that's the latest and greatest thing.\n\n237\n00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.630\nThe buzz word says, hey,\nI got to have the cloud.\n\n238\n00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.540\nI've heard that with other technologies,\nit always seems to turn out bad.\n\n239\n00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.900\nSomeone gets something just based\non the fact that it's the current\n\n240\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.380\nflavor of the day.\n\n241\n00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.670\nIt looks cool, sounds cool.\n\n242\n00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.220\nI got to get it.\n\n243\n00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.360\nI got what's in fashion so to speak.\n\n244\n00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.690\nSo as a security person, I would say no.\n\n245\n00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.060\nYou should never be in that\nposition where you're like,\n\n246\n00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.290\nI want to go with what\nthe flavor of the day is.\n\n247\n00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:27.350\nYou want something that you\nknow you're where you're going.\n\n248\n00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.110\nYou know what benefits you're\ntrying to reap and go for it.\n\n249\n00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:35.040\nIn the case of the cloud benefits you're\nlooking for, are you're looking for\n\n250\n00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.090\nthe ability to have\nbetter fault tolerance.\n\n251\n00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.480\nThat would be a big benefit of it.\n\n252\n00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.940\nIf you go with a provider, you wanna\nmake sure that they have the ability to,\n\n253\n00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.150\nI like to say,\ntake a punch and keep going.\n\n254\n00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.510\nYou wanna have that.\n\n255\n00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.200\nBig providers are gonna\nbe able to do that.\n\n256\n00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.990\nIf there's a big storm in some part\nof the country, or some disaster,\n\n257\n00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.550\nwhat have you, they've got other\ncenters that replicate their data over,\n\n258\n00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.590\nso you've got a big benefit there.\n\n259\n00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.650\nYou may also be trying to, in the case\nof something like mail services.\n\n260\n00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:15.770\nMail services, I know a lot of\norganizations that are going to hosting\n\n261\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.130\ntheir mail services in the cloud.\n\n262\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:23.670\nBecause they no longer have to worry,\nat least, worry about the same issues\n\n263\n00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:28.010\nthat they had to worry about by hosting\nall the stuff like Exchange on site.\n\n264\n00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.210\nI mean let's face it.\n\n265\n00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:33.470\nThere may be people watching\nthis that are Exchange experts.\n\n266\n00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.420\nThey've been doing this for\na while and they understand it and\n\n267\n00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.230\nknow it and feel comfortable with it.\n\n268\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.070\nYou people especially should\nknow that Exchange is\n\n269\n00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.600\nnot something that's\nthe easiest thing to maintain.\n\n270\n00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.220\nIt's a good product,\nnot saying anything against that.\n\n271\n00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:54.720\nIt's not something that you just point and\nclick, you've got to know your stuff.\n\n272\n00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.488\nSo if I Taking exchange and\nhosting it someplace else and\n\n273\n00:15:58.488 --> 00:16:01.374\nsaying I just want X\nnumber of mailboxes and\n\n274\n00:16:01.374 --> 00:16:05.480\nI want to be able to do certain\nthings to my console on my side.\n\n275\n00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.790\nYou've taken away a lot of those things.\n\n276\n00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:13.650\nSo you're reaping the benefit of being\nable to put those funds someplace else.\n\n277\n00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:18.155\nEither towards additional training, maybe\nincreasing your IT staff, what have you,\n\n278\n00:16:18.155 --> 00:16:20.460\nyou've got benefits from that.\n\n279\n00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.720\nAnd so you got shared data,\nshared services,\n\n280\n00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:29.595\nthe benefits of being able to\naccess them almost anywhere.\n\n281\n00:16:29.595 --> 00:16:33.095\nI mean, there's a tremendous\namount of things there, however,\n\n282\n00:16:33.095 --> 00:16:35.715\nyou still also have to\nconsider security too.\n\n283\n00:16:35.715 --> 00:16:37.205\nDon't just look at the features and say,\n\n284\n00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.373\noh that looks great,\nthey're giving me a lot of stuff.\n\n285\n00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:44.367\nThey have 24/7 support,\nthey've got people that are right\n\n286\n00:16:44.367 --> 00:16:48.315\nhere in whatever country I'm in,\nthey're familiar with the needs here,\n\n287\n00:16:48.315 --> 00:16:52.070\nthey speak the same language and\nthere's no barrier there.\n\n288\n00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.430\nI don't have wait for certain hours for\nthem to be available.\n\n289\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.400\nAll those things.\n\n290\n00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.720\nThat's another big, big,\nbig benefit that you wanna reap.\n\n291\n00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.346\nBut make sure whatever you come in with,\nand I think this has been a bit big\n\n292\n00:17:05.346 --> 00:17:10.300\nproblem with doing stuff in the cloud,\nis people look at features and\n\n293\n00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.600\nthey don't really look at in the long term\nwhat those features really mean to them.\n\n294\n00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.900\nOne of the things that I've seen that\nhas been pushed as a benefit is to talk\n\n295\n00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.400\nwith the mail server issue.\n\n296\n00:17:22.456 --> 00:17:27.480\nI ran into someone that was a good example\nof this back in California is that his\n\n297\n00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.900\nstate agency was pushing, or has pushed,\neverything out to the cloud,\n\n298\n00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.560\nat this point, they've all pushed\neverything out to the cloud.\n\n299\n00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:40.500\nThey want to get rid of the mail\nservices or the mail server's on site,\n\n300\n00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.660\nso they want to push them outside.\n\n301\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.090\nSo they looked at the numbers and\neverything, and\n\n302\n00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.340\nthen they said,\nwell it's gonna be much cheaper.\n\n303\n00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:51.950\nIt's this cost per month to maintain\na mailbox, on a mailbox by mailbox basis.\n\n304\n00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:57.810\nIf we go over to Microsoft solution\nit's this much less, so wow,\n\n305\n00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:02.430\nthat's a big savings there,\nbecause we have thousands of mailboxes.\n\n306\n00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.190\nIt's like, yeah, not so fast sunshine,\n\n307\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.890\nbecause you're not\nfactoring everything in.\n\n308\n00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.440\nYou're only looking at raw numbers,\n\n309\n00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.870\nyou're not looking at all the other\nstuff that comes on top of it.\n\n310\n00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.960\nHe, being an experienced IT guy and\n\n311\n00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.260\na security guy said, here's all the other\nnumbers you're not factoring in.\n\n312\n00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.150\nHe says, let's make sure you're\nspeaking truthfully here.\n\n313\n00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.790\nSo where they thought they\nwere coming out way ahead\n\n314\n00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.340\nit was almost the exact opposite.\n\n315\n00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:30.690\nThey were coming out behind by\npushing them off site because there\n\n316\n00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.340\nwas lower maintenance costs and stuff\nlike that by actually keeping it on site.\n\n317\n00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.870\nAnd that's always gonna be true, but the\ncosts were lower by keeping it on site.\n\n318\n00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:42.970\nBut state of California\ndecided that all their\n\n319\n00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:47.330\nstate agencies were gonna do that,\nso even though he was like,\n\n320\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:52.280\nthis is not a good idea, they were\nlike no it's going out there so yeah.\n\n321\n00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.100\nI'm sorry, I'm from California, we're\nnot known for making smart decisions.\n\n322\n00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.470\nWe did elect Jerry Brown after all.\n\n323\n00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.060\n[LAUGH]\n>> And had an actor.\n\n324\n00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.780\nYou had an actor as a governor.\n\n325\n00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:00.995\nI mean, come on.\n[LAUGH]\n\n326\n00:19:00.995 --> 00:19:02.411\n>> Oh, now that was cool.\n\n327\n00:19:02.411 --> 00:19:05.860\n>> It is true.\nYou did have the Terminator up there.\n\n328\n00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.920\nYou mentioned security.\n\n329\n00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.270\nThere's definitely a lot of other\nconcerns when it comes to security and\n\n330\n00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.970\ncloud computing.\n\n331\n00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.280\nWhat are some of the things\nthat we really gotta focus on?\n\n332\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:22.850\n>> A lot of things that you're gonna be\nfocusing on outside of the basics is going\n\n333\n00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.890\nto be things like, cuz there are things\nthat every instrument needs to have.\n\n334\n00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.620\nThey need to make sure that\nthey're gonna have support,\n\n335\n00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.330\nthey're gonna have scalability,\nit's gonna be there when they need it,\n\n336\n00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.110\nall the things are there.\n\n337\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:37.100\nOkay, so we take those things and\nwe put them off to the side.\n\n338\n00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:42.260\nWhat are things that you really,\nreally, really need to ask on well, and\n\n339\n00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:48.000\nexamine a bit more, is, those are things\nthat your business needs to provide.\n\n340\n00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.790\nIf your business is providing services to\ncustomers or specific application needs,\n\n341\n00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:57.380\nspecific legal requirements, those\nare things that you need to flush out\n\n342\n00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.170\nbefore you go to that service provider\nto see if they can actually meet it,\n\n343\n00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.180\nbecause they don't know that.\n\n344\n00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.220\nThat health care company I was\ntalking about back in California,\n\n345\n00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:13.670\nthey went to somebody that was a third\nparty, that did IT consulting a lot,\n\n346\n00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:17.920\nto actually set up their whole\ncloud solution, because they,\n\n347\n00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.030\neven with all their experience, they did\nnot feel they had enough knowledge on\n\n348\n00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:27.650\nstaff to make that, to make that\ntransition and have everything happen.\n\n349\n00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:31.490\nAnd the way it worked out is when\nthey brought these IT consultants in,\n\n350\n00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:36.420\nthose IT consultants had to consult\nwith the people that were already\n\n351\n00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.320\nthere on site with their current solutions\nwere doing and what they need to maintain.\n\n352\n00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.780\nSo they had that and that was the obvious\npart, but then they had to bring in\n\n353\n00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:51.920\nthe legal guys to say okay we're\nkinda wading into new territory here.\n\n354\n00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.330\nSo what types of things\ndoes HIPAA require?\n\n355\n00:20:55.330 --> 00:21:00.290\nThey had some HIPAA experience, so\nthey were able to look at that.\n\n356\n00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.790\nBut then someone,\nwhen they dug into it even more,\n\n357\n00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:08.740\nsomeone said, yeah, did you know state\nof California has some additional\n\n358\n00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.010\nrequirements that need to be met from\nwhatever your cloud provider is?\n\n359\n00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.650\nAnd they said up to a certain point, well,\nwe thought we were gonna be able to go\n\n360\n00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:21.690\nwith a commercial provider, but they got\nto a point where it said we can't do that,\n\n361\n00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:26.440\nbecause we cannot say\nwith a high enough degree\n\n362\n00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:31.410\nof confidence that they're gonna be able\nto provide the protection that we need.\n\n363\n00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:36.290\nAnd the protection they were looking for\nwas stuff like encryption, whether\n\n364\n00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.870\nthey were able to provide the proper\nlevel of encryption that they needed.\n\n365\n00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:44.890\nAnd there were also things like,\ncould they give them a solid guarantee\n\n366\n00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:49.410\nthat their stuff was gonna be in a big,\niron box so to speak and\n\n367\n00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:55.070\nno one else was gonna be able to\npenetrate that and access their data.\n\n368\n00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.720\nNobody could make those promises to them.\n\n369\n00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.860\nThey said, you're on a shared environment.\n\n370\n00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:05.230\nWe can allocate stuff to you and give you\nstuff off to the side to say that's yours,\n\n371\n00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.240\nbut you're still in a shared\nhosting environment.\n\n372\n00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.780\nThe people that\nare touching those servers,\n\n373\n00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.730\neven if we gave you servers that were\ncompletely dedicated to your stuff and\n\n374\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:19.530\nyour stuff alone, there's still people\nhere because you've outsourced it to us,\n\n375\n00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:22.260\nthat are going to be babysitting\nthose things and taking care of it.\n\n376\n00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:28.140\nSo with that all being factored in, we're\njust gonna have to, to make sure that\n\n377\n00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:33.460\nwe can sleep well at night and make sure\nthat we're not sued to hell and back.\n\n378\n00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.900\nWe're just gonna go through and build\na whole private cloud here from the ground\n\n379\n00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.570\nup, and so that's indeed what they did,\nand they haven't\n\n380\n00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:47.970\nhad to deal with any of those problems,\nthose things went away immediately.\n\n381\n00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.450\nYeah, the costs went way up,\n\n382\n00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:54.910\ncuz now you've gotta bring all of\nthat on site and do it the right way.\n\n383\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:59.740\nBut you're able to, in the long term,\nsleep better at night and\n\n384\n00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.550\nyou'll have a lower risk\nof some of those breaches.\n\n385\n00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.150\nSo you really want to make sure\nyou get the right solution.\n\n386\n00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:11.490\nYou don't want to be a company,\nand I won't tell you who it is,\n\n387\n00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:16.870\nbut I know of a company that got\ncaught in the whole thing and\n\n388\n00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:21.520\nit's like, well, we're hosting\nvirtual labs and stuff like that.\n\n389\n00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.180\nAnyway, it was a educational company.\n\n390\n00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.960\nAnd they wanted to host their\nvirtual labs and they didn't want to\n\n391\n00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.310\npay someone to outsource it or\nhost those things for them.\n\n392\n00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:36.655\nSo what they did, and it's a valid idea,\nthey didn't plan it right.\n\n393\n00:23:36.655 --> 00:23:41.490\nThey made their own private cloud and\ninvested, from what they told me,\n\n394\n00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.990\ninvested some obscene amount of money.\n\n395\n00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:48.868\nIt was in the mid-six figures or\nhigher, to build their own cloud, and\n\n396\n00:23:48.868 --> 00:23:52.709\nso they built their own cloud and\ngot everything set up.\n\n397\n00:23:52.709 --> 00:23:57.329\nIt didn't do what they needed it to\nbecause they didn't plan it right.\n\n398\n00:23:57.329 --> 00:23:59.106\nEverything was all wrong so\n\n399\n00:23:59.106 --> 00:24:04.048\nit ended up that this 6 figure investment\nthat they put in to a cloud became,\n\n400\n00:24:04.048 --> 00:24:08.010\na couple of the guys in the IT department,\nbecame their toy.\n\n401\n00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:11.410\nThey got to try out all different\nsorts of screwy things on there.\n\n402\n00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.580\nAnd I remember talking to these guys and\nlike what are you doing this for?\n\n403\n00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.520\nWell no one else is using it.\n\n404\n00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.190\nYou've got to be kidding me.\n\n405\n00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.470\nThat stuff's, you've not even taken\nsome of that little cellophane they have\n\n406\n00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.293\non the windows and stuff.\n\n407\n00:24:22.293 --> 00:24:23.860\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> You haven't even taken that off yet.\n\n408\n00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.525\nYou know, it's like they only got it less\nthan a year ago before they decided that,\n\n409\n00:24:27.525 --> 00:24:29.060\nhey,this wasn't the right solution.\n\n410\n00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.930\n>> Wow.\n>> You know,\n\n411\n00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:33.210\nso that would be a dumb route to go.\n\n412\n00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.470\nYou've gone through and\n\n413\n00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.760\nwasted a lot of money on something\nthat you ultimately can't use.\n\n414\n00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.130\nI'd say in their case they were saying\nthey couldn't use it I'd say in their\n\n415\n00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.190\ncase, even though you spent that amount\nof money it wasn't going to be used for\n\n416\n00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.000\nwhat you originally thought\nit was going to be used for.\n\n417\n00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.330\nYou could have actually found something\nthat was more practical for it.\n\n418\n00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.595\nRather than the IT guys going hey,\nwe've got this big box to put stuff on.\n\n419\n00:24:54.595 --> 00:24:57.260\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I've got my own cloud that I manage,\n\n420\n00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.350\nit's like what?\n\n421\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.390\nYou could have found a solution for it.\n\n422\n00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.670\nBut, you want to be\nthe situation where you have.\n\n423\n00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.720\nA problem and\nyou address a solution to it.\n\n424\n00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.570\nYou don't want to have a solution in\nsearch of a problem which is what they\n\n425\n00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:11.870\nended up with.\n\n426\n00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:15.470\n>> And then we've also got to worry about\nthe vulnerabilities of the problems was\n\n427\n00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.640\none of those things that we didn't have to\ndeal with when everything was in house.\n\n428\n00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:23.040\nYeah, there's almost\nan endless amount of those,\n\n429\n00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.760\nand a lot of those things are things that\nwe've seen before in other areas like\n\n430\n00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.250\nconnectivity problems,\nyou lost control of it.\n\n431\n00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.590\nI mean interestingly enough,\n\n432\n00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:37.970\nthe lots control is something that's\nnot really necessarily a vulnerability.\n\n433\n00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:42.150\nYou know, if you lose control of it, yeah,\nyou better trust whose on the other side\n\n434\n00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.500\nof that wire that they know their\nstuff and they are obeying the rules.\n\n435\n00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.590\nAnd everything is all safe and sound.\n\n436\n00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:54.790\nYou're hoping that but there could\nbe other issues that come into play.\n\n437\n00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.750\nDo you trust those people out there?\n\n438\n00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.390\nAre they keeping it safe?\n\n439\n00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:05.410\nAre they going to inform you\n\n440\n00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:10.070\nwhen there's a problem or\nschedule out time or something?\n\n441\n00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.860\nI've seen that happened where they\njust Well, just gonna turn it off and\n\n442\n00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.770\ndo maintenance right now.\n\n443\n00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:18.235\nIt's like, be nice if you kinda told\nus that, that you were gonna do that.\n\n444\n00:26:18.235 --> 00:26:19.640\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Actually, you believe it?\n\n445\n00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.230\nI actually ran into somebody that\nwas using a Cloud server provider.\n\n446\n00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:30.100\nThey very rarely told them when\nthey were gonna do maintenance,\n\n447\n00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.290\nand all the maintenance\nthey could have done.\n\n448\n00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.820\nThey could have done in the evening.\n\n449\n00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.400\nAnd done it less invasively.\n\n450\n00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.020\nLike most sane companies will do if\nthey're not 24 hours will do at 2 in\n\n451\n00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.430\nthe morning on like a Saturday or\nsomething.\n\n452\n00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:47.745\nSo everybody's either asleep or\ndrunk or something like that.\n\n453\n00:26:47.745 --> 00:26:49.380\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> The point being, they're not there.\n\n454\n00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.160\n>> You know, at the work place,\nso it's gonna be low impact.\n\n455\n00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.540\nBut they would just do it whenever\nthey kind of felt like it.\n\n456\n00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.640\nYou know you kind of have a picture,\n\n457\n00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.500\nthere's some guy just sitting there kind\nof trying to justify his paycheck just\n\n458\n00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.720\nflipping a switch going\nyeah let's take it down.\n\n459\n00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.970\nAnd I'm gonna do it right at 1:00\nin the afternoon on like a Monday\n\n460\n00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.930\ncuz no one would be using the stuff\nin the middle of the day like that.\n\n461\n00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:12.270\nAnd you had them where they\ncouldn't access their stuff.\n\n462\n00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.710\nIt was frustrating.\n\n463\n00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.880\nNo kidding.\n\n464\n00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.810\nSo that would be something that would\nbe a big vulnerability you bet.\n\n465\n00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:22.570\nSo you don't want to run\ninto those type of things.\n\n466\n00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:26.570\nAnd we talk about some of these other\nvulnerabilities too is that remember when\n\n467\n00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:31.980\nyou put stuff up in the cloud do consider\nwho else could be potentially viewing it.\n\n468\n00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.500\nThat's why if you throw\nstuff up in the cloud.\n\n469\n00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.730\nThere should be no, I would say for all\nextensive purposes there should be no case\n\n470\n00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.110\nwhere you don't put\nsomething in the cloud and\n\n471\n00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.600\nhave it encrypted before it gets there.\n\n472\n00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.900\nAnd I would even add in,\nI do not want, like I said before,\n\n473\n00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.200\nI do not want someone\nelse control my keys.\n\n474\n00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.300\nThose keys either are gonna\nbe in my control or\n\n475\n00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.780\nthey're gonna be a third\nparty that's in a key escrow.\n\n476\n00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.030\nThey're not gonna be with that ISP because\nI do not want the ISP put in a situation\n\n477\n00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:01.510\nwhere either they have to give a queue\nwithout telling me, or if someone decides\n\n478\n00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:05.170\nthat they wanna start poking and prying\non my stuff and you do get people at it,\n\n479\n00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:09.980\nas much as we like to think that that\ndoesn't happen, that happens all the time.\n\n480\n00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:15.100\nEvery company that handles data has\npeople that poke around on it and\n\n481\n00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.880\nit's kinda something that\nyou assume happens, but\n\n482\n00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.270\nwho knows what someone may poke around and\nfind.\n\n483\n00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:25.570\nPeople nowadays, not only are they\npoking around in it, they love just,\n\n484\n00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:30.690\nhey look what I found and\nspill the beans with stuff,\n\n485\n00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.900\nand all of a sudden,\nthey're making headlines.\n\n486\n00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.930\nLook at this company is trying to do.\n\n487\n00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.360\nNow you've got to spin that.\n\n488\n00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.910\nYou've got the legal\nissues going with it and\n\n489\n00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:42.340\na whole bunch of things\nthat come out with it.\n\n490\n00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.170\nSo you really you've got.\n\n491\n00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.290\nHow many issues can we talk\nabout with vulnerabilities.\n\n492\n00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:51.800\nAnd that's not even factoring in the other\nvulnerabilities that we get if we\n\n493\n00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.340\nare hosting stuff like web apps and\ndatabases and stuff like that.\n\n494\n00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.040\nThose are still vulnerable to\nthe stuff that web apps and\n\n495\n00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.060\ndatabases are normally vulnerable to.\n\n496\n00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.780\nEspecially if you are talking\nsomething like, a database being.\n\n497\n00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.140\nBeing interacting with a web application.\n\n498\n00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.410\nThere comes SQL injection.\n\n499\n00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:10.200\nThose are no different in operation\nthey would be in other case.\n\n500\n00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.300\n>> All right well Sean a lot of great\ninformation about going to cloud and\n\n501\n00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.910\nnot so\nhappy with those white puffy clouds but.\n\n502\n00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:17.639\n>> I know I gotta get there.\n\n503\n00:29:17.639 --> 00:29:20.420\n[LAUGH] So at least now I've got\na good idea of what I need to do\n\n504\n00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:24.950\nif I'm gonna design part of my\nnetwork to be out there in the cloud.\n\n505\n00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:25.620\nGood info on that.\n\n506\n00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.820\nAnything else we wanna throw\nin before we wrap that one up?\n\n507\n00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.720\n>> Yeah, just one.\n\n508\n00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.260\nIt's not necessarily\na short statement here, but\n\n509\n00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:37.720\nsomething to throw in at the end of this\nis talking about the research part of it.\n\n510\n00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.270\nProbably one of the bigger challenges you\nhave when you're deciding to make that\n\n511\n00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:44.990\nmove to that cloud and\ndo that plan is just\n\n512\n00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:49.940\nall the different opinions\nthat are out there.\n\n513\n00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.720\nI've several time over\nthe past handful of years\n\n514\n00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:58.060\nsince the cloud kind of got\na lot steam behind it and\n\n515\n00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:03.550\npush behind it I have seen numerous\nsituations of the consultant.\n\n516\n00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:08.800\nNumerous situations had to teach\nthe stuff too in numerous cases.\n\n517\n00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.266\nYou won't believe the types of\ninformation that's out there.\n\n518\n00:30:12.266 --> 00:30:16.260\nThe endless sea of have stuff out there\nthat's written about the Cloud and\n\n519\n00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:21.040\na lot of it is either crap or\nit's contradictory or it's incomplete.\n\n520\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.710\nThat's probably the biggest\nfrustration you have.\n\n521\n00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.650\nI mean the Cloud has been out long enough\nthat you figure people had their act\n\n522\n00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.590\ntogether and\nwe have some consistent things out there,\n\n523\n00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.770\nwhich there are some consistent guides and\n\n524\n00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:35.600\nthings to help you out, to really\nkinda steer your decisions better.\n\n525\n00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.700\nAnd relevant information and\nstuff like that.\n\n526\n00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.250\nIt's really.\n\n527\n00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.660\nWhile there is that out there and\nit's getting better.\n\n528\n00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:47.020\nYou're seeing really just a sea of\n\n529\n00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:51.200\ndocumentation and guidances out there and\nbest practices that are out there.\n\n530\n00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.240\nAnd they can conflict just so much and\n\n531\n00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.520\ncause you confusion that you may\njust say I want out of this.\n\n532\n00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.820\nI don't want to deal with this.\n\n533\n00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.810\nI've had that happen to me numerous times.\n\n534\n00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:07.630\nI swear I've had people ask me\nquestions about the Cloud and\n\n535\n00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:13.800\nlatent security and\nI give them what my view on it is.\n\n536\n00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:18.030\nAnd you can go on the web and find that,\nand find not only a view that\n\n537\n00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:22.970\nmay be like mine, but you can find\n100 other different answers to that.\n\n538\n00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:26.450\nAnd those 100 different answers may\nhave come from 20 different people\n\n539\n00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.590\nit seems like.\n\n540\n00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.750\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So that's\n\n541\n00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.050\nprobably one of the biggest\nproblems you've got.\n\n542\n00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:35.690\nAnd I hope you've got help\nif you have to really\n\n543\n00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:39.170\ndecide the Cloud, or maintain the Cloud.\n\n544\n00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.400\nI hope you really have help to\ndecide whether the issue is for,\n\n545\n00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.960\nit's really gonna be a team effort.\n\n546\n00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.490\nIt's not something you should do on your\nown because you're gonna need help to go\n\n547\n00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:48.090\nthrough all this information and\nconsolidate it.\n\n548\n00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.540\nThat's why you need to\nhave that checklist.\n\n549\n00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.390\nI highly recommend you have\na checklist that really concisely and\n\n550\n00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.560\nquickly says,\nthese things need to be addressed.\n\n551\n00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.525\nAnd then we start researching a solution.\n\n552\n00:31:59.525 --> 00:32:01.195\nTo go into your service provider and\n\n553\n00:32:01.195 --> 00:32:04.015\nall that, you could make sure\nthat those things are being met.\n\n554\n00:32:04.015 --> 00:32:08.735\nAt least you can be clear on what you\nwant before you do your research and\n\n555\n00:32:08.735 --> 00:32:10.605\nhave to sort through all of that big mess.\n\n556\n00:32:10.605 --> 00:32:12.860\n>> Very good.\nAll right, well ladies and\n\n557\n00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.330\ngentlemen that's going to bring\nus to the end of another episode.\n\n558\n00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.050\nHope you guys enjoyed watching

00:00:14.746\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:17.672\nAnd with me today is Mr.\nSean Oriyano, how are you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.672 --> 00:00:19.297\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:19.297 --> 00:00:20.969\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:24.632\nHere we are doing another episode of our\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioners\n\n8\n00:00:24.632 --> 00:00:27.920\nseries, and this one we're going to\nbe taking a look at virtualization,\n\n9\n00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.430\na part of everybody's network,\nit seems like, Sean.\n\n10\n00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.170\n>> Yeah, it's pretty much in some\nway shape or form that's gonna be\n\n11\n00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.840\nbounced around, a term that's gonna\nbe used all over the place and\n\n12\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.790\nit's definitely not something that we're\ngonna see the end of any time soon.\n\n13\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.390\nIt's definitely gonna be in here for the\nlong haul, it's already been out here for\n\n14\n00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.590\nseveral years,\nIt's gonna continue to be out there,\n\n15\n00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.626\njust because it does a lot of neat things\nand provides us a lot of benefits.\n\n16\n00:00:57.626 --> 00:01:00.600\nSo we need it, but that being the case,\n\n17\n00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.940\nwe need to talk about how that fits in\nas far as our security planning goes.\n\n18\n00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.910\nBecause how can we leverage\nthe benefits of it?\n\n19\n00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.280\nAnd are there any problems?\n\n20\n00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.830\nEvery technology and\nevery situation has some problems.\n\n21\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.870\nSo, there's sure to be some\nwith virtualization, too,\n\n22\n00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.550\nso we kinda need to discuss those as well.\n\n23\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.996\nThough, I don't know\nwhat to say except hey,\n\n24\n00:01:22.996 --> 00:01:26.195\nyou talk about virtualization.\n\n25\n00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:29.551\nHow many different solutions can you even\nthink of with what they're using nowadays.\n\n26\n00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:31.408\n>> There's quite a few.\n\n27\n00:01:31.408 --> 00:01:33.740\nVirtualization brings a lot\nof things to the table.\n\n28\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.190\nIt lets us consolidate servers.\n\n29\n00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.110\nIt's probably one of the biggest things\nI see people using virtualization for,\n\n30\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.142\ntaking a physical server that I could have\nrun a single operating system on there and\n\n31\n00:01:44.142 --> 00:01:45.980\ninstall a couple roles on it.\n\n32\n00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.140\nAnd basically just barely\ntickle the processor,\n\n33\n00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.686\nnot come close to\nutilizing all the RAM and\n\n34\n00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:55.780\nall the performance that server brings\nwas leftover virtualization on there.\n\n35\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.960\nNow I can run 5, 10 different servers on\nthat one physical hardware platform and\n\n36\n00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.910\nI could take full advantage of\nthose 4 quad core processors and\n\n37\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.210\nthat 64 gigabytes of RAM\nthat's in that server.\n\n38\n00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.510\nSo at a bare minimum,\nlet's just consolidate our servers and\n\n39\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.660\nthat's a good thing.\n\n40\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.330\nI remember when we first\nwent to virtualization here\n\n41\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.090\nwe were up to about 15 physical servers\nin our racks and our server closet.\n\n42\n00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.750\nAnd through the use of virtualization,\nwe were down to three physical servers and\n\n43\n00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.290\nthat was just because we\nwanted the fault tolerance and\n\n44\n00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.540\nthe ability to load balance on it.\n\n45\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.080\nWe could have probably gone further\nthan that but so at a minimum,\n\n46\n00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.770\nthat's one of the things why we see so\nmuch virtualization.\n\n47\n00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.600\nIsolations of operating systems,\n\n48\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.530\nisolation of applications that can't\nco-habituate, that don't get along.\n\n49\n00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.690\nDifferent versions of the same program,\nfor example,\n\n50\n00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.620\nbeing able to host that on two separate\nvirtual servers because you can't install\n\n51\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.830\nit, both versions on the same server.\n\n52\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.380\nSo a lot of uses of it within our network,\nbut it\n\n53\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.140\ndoes introduce some concerns as well when\nit comes to designing a secure network.\n\n54\n00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.210\n>> Yeah, it absolutely does.\n\n55\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.090\nThe stuff that you were mentioning\nthat it's being used for,\n\n56\n00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.130\nthose are always front and\ncenter when they talk about it.\n\n57\n00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.050\nWhen they talk about\nvirtualization it's like, yeah,\n\n58\n00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.290\nwe can really kind of eliminate\nsome of this extra hardware,\n\n59\n00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.380\nso to speak, and\njust squeeze it down onto fewer systems.\n\n60\n00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.320\nAnd just limit to the ones that we\nneed just to keep some level of\n\n61\n00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.900\nreal redundancy there like\nyou said you're doing here.\n\n62\n00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.830\n>> Eliminate all those\nextra power supplies.\n\n63\n00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.960\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> Also reduces my cooling cost.\n\n64\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.270\nIt's definitely a domino\neffect when it comes to\n\n65\n00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.530\nthe savings that you can\nget from virtualization.\n\n66\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.630\n>> Yeah, that's been one\nof the big areas that yeah,\n\n67\n00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.890\neven the green aspect of it, yeah, that\nthey can really just consolidate there.\n\n68\n00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.390\nSo that's pushed.\n\n69\n00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.010\nAnd then of course,\nthe other ones you were mentioning.\n\n70\n00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.010\nIf you were going to attach\ndifferent versions of applications.\n\n71\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.100\nThat's been something that they've had\na real love affair with that they can host\n\n72\n00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.100\nall these different version of\nan application without having to go do\n\n73\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.690\nthe same type of stuff they would've\nhad to do before to get it.\n\n74\n00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.740\nAnd then there's other benefits\nfrom the security standpoint.\n\n75\n00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.310\nThe isolation part, big one, big, big, big\none there is that we can wrap something\n\n76\n00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.332\nin a nice little virtualized package and\nit's its own island unto itself and\n\n77\n00:04:20.332 --> 00:04:24.826\nwe can decide to open that up as much\nas we want or as little as we want.\n\n78\n00:04:24.826 --> 00:04:30.117\nAnd heck, even depending on the\nvirtualization technology you're choosing,\n\n79\n00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:35.015\nthat's even going to dictate just how\nmuch you can open it and how secure and\n\n80\n00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:36.748\ninsecure it actually is.\n\n81\n00:04:36.748 --> 00:04:41.432\nCuz there's virtualization strategies on\nthe low end, there's stuff that's like not\n\n82\n00:04:41.432 --> 00:04:45.240\nto pick on it, like the McDonald's\nof virtualization solutions.\n\n83\n00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.839\nThen there's the high end stuff like\nthe Burger King, no, I'm kidding,\n\n84\n00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:53.210\nthere's the higher end\nsolutions that offer more.\n\n85\n00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.310\nI mean, I'd say something like on the low\nend we'd have something like virtual PC.\n\n86\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.220\nI don't think anyone's\ngonna argue that that's not\n\n87\n00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.850\na lower end solution as far\nas virtualization does.\n\n88\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.390\nIt does virtualization.\n\n89\n00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.340\nIt's designed to do\nvery small scale stuff.\n\n90\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.450\nAnd if you push it any further than just\nhost an individual operating system or\n\n91\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.400\ntwo, you're really\nstretching it far beyond\n\n92\n00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.340\nwhat it was originally designed for.\n\n93\n00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.286\n>> It was one of those good old type\ntwo hypervisors where you're actually\n\n94\n00:05:21.286 --> 00:05:25.491\nrunning the hypervisor on top\nof an operating system like a,\n\n95\n00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:30.533\nI think VM workstation is one,\nVM Player or not VM Player, VirtualBox.\n\n96\n00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:33.528\nMicrosoft's Virtual PC was another one.\n\n97\n00:05:33.528 --> 00:05:37.490\nReally when you get into the Enterprise,\nwe move to those type 1 hypervisors where\n\n98\n00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.957\nit goes down on the bare metal system and\nit goes underneath everything.\n\n99\n00:05:40.957 --> 00:05:45.267\nAnd so even the operating system,\nthe hypervisor's underneath everything,\n\n100\n00:05:45.267 --> 00:05:47.656\nsits right directly on\ntop of the hardware.\n\n101\n00:05:47.656 --> 00:05:51.464\n>> Yeah, which one you choose is\ndefinitely gonna impact what type of\n\n102\n00:05:51.464 --> 00:05:55.170\nsecurity benefit you're gonna\nbe able to reap from that.\n\n103\n00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.938\nSo if you just wanna host different\nversions of an application or\n\n104\n00:05:59.938 --> 00:06:02.850\nOS, or if you wanna consolidate a bit,\n\n105\n00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.180\nyou can use almost any virtualization\nsolution will accomplish that.\n\n106\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.300\nBut if you want to really do isolation,\nthen you kinda gotta bump things up and\n\n107\n00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.650\njust decide how aggressive\nyou want to get with it.\n\n108\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.632\nYou can do isolation with both\nthe virtualization levels that Mike was\n\n109\n00:06:18.632 --> 00:06:19.730\nmentioning.\n\n110\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.090\nYou can do both of those just\none's gonna be a lot better to do\n\n111\n00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.440\nthan the other if you're really\nserious about locking stuff down and\n\n112\n00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.990\nkeeping it from things from getting in or\nmixing and matching.\n\n113\n00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.820\nSo you'll have to kind of take\nthat type of step into account.\n\n114\n00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.980\nThen there's on top of the isolation\npart of it which it's like setup.\n\n115\n00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.740\nBig benefit that you can keep stuff\nin their own little bubbles and\n\n116\n00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.410\nthey talk as much as you want to or\nas little as you want to.\n\n117\n00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.420\nYou can make them each act like their own\nindividual machine, they don't know other\n\n118\n00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.850\nones exist out there, there's no sharing,\nno touching, none of that.\n\n119\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:01.240\nBut then other reasons that\nthey've used virtualization,on\n\n120\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.010\nthe security side, is for\ntesting development purposes.\n\n121\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.370\nIt's so incredibly easy to just use that,\n\n122\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.550\nuse a virtualized environment\nto install a clean slate.\n\n123\n00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.710\nAnd then test your stuff on top of it,\nand if you break it, hey whatever,\n\n124\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.120\nI can either roll back a snapshot on it,\nor\n\n125\n00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.850\nI can grab a copy of it,\ngrab a clean copy of it and\n\n126\n00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.240\ndrop it in, re-attach it and\nstart from scratch if you want.\n\n127\n00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.820\nYou can't do that as easily\non a physical system.\n\n128\n00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.360\nYou can do it but\nit is a lot more involved.\n\n129\n00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.680\nAnd so you can really reap those benefits,\ntoo and\n\n130\n00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.770\nthere's even other stuff beyond that.\n\n131\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.410\nIf you do use virtualization,\nyou can really even do stuff.\n\n132\n00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.650\nIf you design it correctly,\n\n133\n00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.350\nyou can kick up your availability\nto an incredibly high level.\n\n134\n00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.780\nBecause you are layering\nsolutions together.\n\n135\n00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.927\nI had talked to somebody that said the way\nthey had introduced virtualization\n\n136\n00:07:59.927 --> 00:08:01.215\nin their environment.\n\n137\n00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:03.306\nWell, they didn't introduce\nit to their environment.\n\n138\n00:08:03.306 --> 00:08:06.963\nWith this project, but\nit was something that they used to\n\n139\n00:08:06.963 --> 00:08:11.410\nreally to do the consolidation and\nincrease the availability.\n\n140\n00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.990\nAnd then they did have the other\nisolation stuff in there to a degree but\n\n141\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.860\nthey did it in a different way.\n\n142\n00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.410\nBut what they did was is it\nwas one of the major banks,\n\n143\n00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.200\nso they deal with all of\nthe different datacenters.\n\n144\n00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.190\nThis is a huge, huge bank, it's a global\none and what they did is instead\n\n145\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.117\nof just having a bunch of datacenters all\nover the country that had just racks and\n\n146\n00:08:31.117 --> 00:08:34.860\nracks and racks of servers and\nall the stuff that went with it and\n\n147\n00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.920\nthe personnel to manage that.\n\n148\n00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.780\nWhat they did is they decided well, we're\ngonna implement a virtualization solution\n\n149\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.400\nand we're gonna have\na sand out there as well.\n\n150\n00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.560\nAnd what they did was they had the front\nend systems that carried the application,\n\n151\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.910\nthey built virtual machines for\neach one of those.\n\n152\n00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:57.100\nAnd once they had those built, they just\nkept those pristine copies of everything.\n\n153\n00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:01.000\nAnd then the data that they were working\nwith was actually sitting somewhere else\n\n154\n00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.690\non the sand.\n\n155\n00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.510\nSo they would connect to that and the\nvirtual machines would connect to that.\n\n156\n00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:10.020\nSo they really had\nthe application side and\n\n157\n00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.100\nthe data side,\nreally isolated from each other there.\n\n158\n00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.368\nAnd then they also had to make sure\nthose virtual systems, to make sure that\n\n159\n00:09:17.368 --> 00:09:21.180\nthey had the best protection they\nhad as far as availability goes.\n\n160\n00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:26.747\nWhen they had copies of virtual machines,\nif one of them got corrupted or\n\n161\n00:09:26.747 --> 00:09:30.764\nflaked out or\nanything during the course of the day,\n\n162\n00:09:30.764 --> 00:09:34.300\nthey may not even try\nto fix that directly.\n\n163\n00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:39.850\nThey might just say you know what,\nI don't need to mess with this\n\n164\n00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.463\nfor a couple hours or whatever.\n\n165\n00:09:42.463 --> 00:09:46.020\nI don't wanna monkey around with this,\nI need to have those services up.\n\n166\n00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.480\nSo what they would do is they\nwould just take one of those,\n\n167\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.080\nstop that virtual machine briefly.\n\n168\n00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.543\nCopy the original copy of that\nvirtual machine back because remember,\n\n169\n00:09:53.543 --> 00:09:55.451\nthey weren't hosting any data there.\n\n170\n00:09:55.451 --> 00:09:58.318\nThose things were preconfigured\nwith everything it needed.\n\n171\n00:09:58.318 --> 00:10:01.959\nAll they do just take the old one,\ncopy the new one over top of it,\n\n172\n00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:06.230\nrestart the virtual machine,\nthey're back where they want it to be.\n\n173\n00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.980\nWhereas before they would have to maybe\nreimage the systems or diagnose a problem.\n\n174\n00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.140\nAnd that could take a considerable amount\nof time depending what the problem was.\n\n175\n00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.500\nAnd so they're able to maintain a\nsubstantially high degree of availability.\n\n176\n00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.920\nThey were able to consolidate\nthe guy told me the datacenters\n\n177\n00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.870\nthey had they were literally able to\nconsolidate them down to like two or\n\n178\n00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.403\nmaybe three racks of a huge building-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n179\n00:10:30.403 --> 00:10:32.555\n>> Down to that with just the SAN out\n\n180\n00:10:32.555 --> 00:10:33.118\nthere.\n\n181\n00:10:33.118 --> 00:10:36.920\nAnd so they maintained all of\nthese facilities out there.\n\n182\n00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:42.360\nAnd they went through facility by\nfacility doing this virtualization\n\n183\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.230\nplus this other solution to get this level\nof protection, this level of availability.\n\n184\n00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:52.140\nAnd it was so well designed that\nthey said, at most any one virtual\n\n185\n00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.980\nmachine the most would ever be\nout with maybe 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n186\n00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.840\nIt was just planned so well ahead and\n\n187\n00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.800\nthat was something that they couldn't\nhave done without virtualization.\n\n188\n00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.720\nThey just did some really good planning,\nstuff that was really well thought out.\n\n189\n00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.990\nAnd it worked really, really, really well.\n\n190\n00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:17.545\nThey were telling me that they had\nVMware doing the virtualization,\n\n191\n00:11:17.545 --> 00:11:20.005\nthen they had the virtual\nmachines inside of that.\n\n192\n00:11:20.005 --> 00:11:24.415\nAt the hardware level, they had raid and\nall that good stuff set up.\n\n193\n00:11:24.415 --> 00:11:27.790\nAnd then they had some level\nredundancy that goes with the SAN.\n\n194\n00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.760\nAnd then of course,\nif that facility got hit,\n\n195\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.980\nthey could just roll it over to\nanother facility or some other place\n\n196\n00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:36.730\nin the country or somewhere else in\nthe world that can pick it up immediately.\n\n197\n00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:40.750\nIt was a hot site situation, where they\ncould just move wherever they want.\n\n198\n00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.920\nIn fact, not even a hot site situation,\n\n199\n00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:48.050\nall those centers were working all\nthe time, but they had the ability\n\n200\n00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:53.000\nto pick up the slack of any of the other\nones at any point in time, if required.\n\n201\n00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.100\nSo natural disaster,\n\n202\n00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.380\nwhatever hits one, power outage whatever,\nit just rolls right over to wherever,\n\n203\n00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.610\nno one notices the bank still processing\ntransactions and everything else.\n\n204\n00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.760\nAnd no one's the wiser\neverything's happening.\n\n205\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.820\n>> Nice.\n\n206\n00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.210\nAnd virtualization doesn't stop there,\nwe've got virtualization of our servers.\n\n207\n00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.500\nWe've got virtualization in our\nlocal area networks as well.\n\n208\n00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.750\n>> Yeah, they're doing that\ntoo on different levels.\n\n209\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:21.001\nWe started with the virtual LANs or\nthe VLANs on the switches,\n\n210\n00:12:21.001 --> 00:12:26.152\nwhere we could just take a switch and\nset up what looked like actual separate\n\n211\n00:12:26.152 --> 00:12:31.900\nnetworks but were really all physically\nconnected to that same device.\n\n212\n00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.480\nThen you can even look further\non the virtualization site,\n\n213\n00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.740\nif you want to throw it in we\neven have virtual switches and\n\n214\n00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.070\nstuff like that which we\ncan actually use too.\n\n215\n00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.230\nSo they brought those in.\n\n216\n00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:48.600\nThe VLANs of course, that was a tremendous\nbenefit to securities which is alone\n\n217\n00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.170\nhave a tremendous benefit, but then when\nyou bring in the VLANs and the ability\n\n218\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:57.910\nto really compartmentalize traffic and\nsort things out the way you want it to.\n\n219\n00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.578\nI probably don't have to tell\nanybody in here that works in IT and\n\n220\n00:13:03.578 --> 00:13:08.068\ndeals with infrastructure what that meant\nto be able to manage your systems more\n\n221\n00:13:08.068 --> 00:13:11.686\nefficiently and more effectively and\ncontrol how things talk,\n\n222\n00:13:11.686 --> 00:13:14.652\nthat was just a great,\ngreat, great thing to have.\n\n223\n00:13:14.652 --> 00:13:18.760\nAnd so virtualization on all\ndifferent levels has changed stuff.\n\n224\n00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.690\nWe're not even talking about,\nif you get to Microsoft's technology.\n\n225\n00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:26.495\nRemember Microsoft's uses virtualization,\nit uses that term in a lot of places.\n\n226\n00:13:26.495 --> 00:13:28.146\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you're like, what?\n\n227\n00:13:28.146 --> 00:13:29.990\nYou go to other places of virtualization,\n\n228\n00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.300\nyou always think of at least I thought\nof for a long time is just hey,\n\n229\n00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.450\nI hear they have an application or\nan operating system, I just screw in like\n\n230\n00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.460\na light bulb into that and do it as\nmany times n my system as I wanted.\n\n231\n00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.470\nMicrosoft starting doing things like\nthey used to run an application\n\n232\n00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.230\nvirtualization with that\nApp-V product they had.\n\n233\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.600\nThat was really cool things that\njust virtualized an individual\n\n234\n00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.250\napplication which was really, really neat,\n\n235\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:00.400\ngot people off of those old\nplatforms like the NT stuff.\n\n236\n00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.990\nWe'd actually be able to get rid of those\nand move those over to a new one, but\n\n237\n00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.580\nthen they also have things,\npresentation visualisation.\n\n238\n00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.285\nI never liked that term-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n239\n00:14:10.285 --> 00:14:10.933\n>> But I understand\n\n240\n00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:12.200\nwhere they're going with it.\n\n241\n00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.750\nBut it's just another term for\nthat Remote Desktop\n\n242\n00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.690\nterminals services situation where I'm\njust showing you the output of stuff.\n\n243\n00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.000\nBut it's really somewhere out in\nla la land that it's being hosted.\n\n244\n00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.970\nYou're not touching it,\nso that also has changed\n\n245\n00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.690\nin a sense the level of security we\nhave and the way we manage things.\n\n246\n00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:36.110\nA security standpoint, the patching and\nmanagement being centralized is\n\n247\n00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:41.040\na huge benefit that's much quicker,\nif you can get away with that.\n\n248\n00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.820\nYou have one server you can go and\npatch stuff on, manage stuff on, and\n\n249\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.820\nthen people just make\nconnections from wherever.\n\n250\n00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.730\nAnd they all think, if you want them\nto look at it that way, they all\n\n251\n00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:55.740\nthink it's being presented on their\ndesktop or it resides in their desktop.\n\n252\n00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.210\nBut it's not, it's sitting some place\nelse and they're none the wiser on that.\n\n253\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.920\nThey don't need to know that\nit's sitting someplace else and\n\n254\n00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.760\nthat also allows you to run multiple\nversions of applications and\n\n255\n00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.460\ndo all different sorts of\ninteresting possibilities.\n\n256\n00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.080\nBut from the security side,\n\n257\n00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.640\nthat's just an awesome amount of power\nto have that I can push this stuff off.\n\n258\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.630\nAnd centralize it and lock it down and\ndo all that good stuff\n\n259\n00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:24.430\nthat I wanna have to really protect\nmyself and make sure my employees and\n\n260\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.160\nthe people interacting the system\nare doing something best possible way.\n\n261\n00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.180\nSo it depends on how far you wanna go,\non how far you wanna take it,\n\n262\n00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.741\n>> And with this virtual LANs,\n\n263\n00:15:34.741 --> 00:15:38.125\nobviously again not news we're\ngiving our virtual LANs ids,\n\n264\n00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:43.210\nand then the switches are filtering that\ntraffic based on data they're controlling.\n\n265\n00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.338\nWhat ports that data is allowed\nto go out based on that ID and\n\n266\n00:15:46.338 --> 00:15:49.582\nkinda security issues you've had\nto deal with with virtual LANs?\n\n267\n00:15:49.582 --> 00:15:54.450\nI would say probably the biggest\nthing I see with virtual LANs\n\n268\n00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.480\nis really just getting them kinda set\nup right on that seems to kind of\n\n269\n00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.920\ncaused some issues with it.\n\n270\n00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.456\nOutside of that, once you have\ngot that initial set up done.\n\n271\n00:16:03.456 --> 00:16:07.730\nIt doesn't seem to be\nthat big of an issue.\n\n272\n00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.885\nSome of the things that people do\nconcern themselves with is that,\n\n273\n00:16:11.885 --> 00:16:16.484\nsince you do by nature in a VLAN have\neverything on and plugged into the same\n\n274\n00:16:16.484 --> 00:16:21.109\nphysical device behind the scenes,\nor you're using some way to do that.\n\n275\n00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.630\nEverything's still going to the same\ndevice so if you can somehow get in and\n\n276\n00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:30.260\ncompromise that switch and\ndo anything to it,\n\n277\n00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.990\nyou can hop over to\ndifferent things on it.\n\n278\n00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:36.640\nAnd there are possibilities with that,\nthat technically,\n\n279\n00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.090\nstuff like flooding it, the switch and\n\n280\n00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:43.790\nstuff like that could cause some results\nthat may allow you to hop through things.\n\n281\n00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.810\nThat's definitely a possibility, but\n\n282\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:50.580\nfor the most part it's really gonna come\ndown to getting the setup just right, and\n\n283\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.370\nmake sure your clients are where\nthey're supposed to be.\n\n284\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.520\nAnd then you're good.\n\n285\n00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.746\nOutside of that, yeah,\nthere's not really too much pf note,\n\n286\n00:16:58.746 --> 00:17:03.559\nat least at this level I wouldn't\nreally concern myself with too much.\n\n287\n00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:07.250\nI don't know if you were thinking\nsomething specific on that.\n\n288\n00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.533\n>> And then storage is obviously\na big portion of designing,\n\n289\n00:17:10.533 --> 00:17:14.760\nwith virtualization, all of a sudden\nwe have to deal with shared storage.\n\n290\n00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.700\nRight, we've got all\nthese virtual servers.\n\n291\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:23.262\nThey're hard drives or VHDs or VHDxs or\nVMDKs or whatever technology we are using.\n\n292\n00:17:23.262 --> 00:17:26.861\nAnd they're all hosted on shared storage,\nlike on a SAN typically, for\n\n293\n00:17:26.861 --> 00:17:28.460\nthat performance.\n\n294\n00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.900\nBut that raises some concerns as well.\n\n295\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.905\n>> Yeah, shared storage,\nit's a great thing.\n\n296\n00:17:32.905 --> 00:17:38.160\nIt's one of the bedrocks that we\nbuild our networking technologies on,\n\n297\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.640\nthat we've always had the ability to\nhave some sort of shared storage.\n\n298\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.830\nIt's one of the reasons why you have\na network in place, you wanna share stuff.\n\n299\n00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:50.415\nSo you roll out a network\nto do just that thing.\n\n300\n00:17:50.415 --> 00:17:54.290\nIn the case of what we're talking in\na modern stance with enterprise storage,\n\n301\n00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:58.585\nwe're not just talking necessarily\nabout that simple file share someplace.\n\n302\n00:17:58.585 --> 00:18:01.590\nAnd we're not just talking\njust about virtualization,\n\n303\n00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.885\nwhich can also be done this way.\n\n304\n00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:08.961\nYou're talking about custom devices,\nor maybe not custom device\n\n305\n00:18:08.961 --> 00:18:13.945\nisn't the right word or, special built\ndevices are another class of devices that\n\n306\n00:18:13.945 --> 00:18:18.600\nare built to store and scale up and\nhold large volumes of data and\n\n307\n00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.390\nhave their own sets of quirks and\nfeatures that go with that.\n\n308\n00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.210\nWhen I think of enterprise storage,\n\n309\n00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.400\nI think of stuff like\nthe NetApp technologies.\n\n310\n00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.500\nNetApp, if you're not\nfamiliar with their stuff,\n\n311\n00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.908\nthey build appliances of different types.\n\n312\n00:18:33.908 --> 00:18:38.349\nOne of their ones that has a lot of\npenetration in the market are these big\n\n313\n00:18:38.349 --> 00:18:42.581\nstorage devices that they have\ndiffering levels of these devices.\n\n314\n00:18:42.581 --> 00:18:47.260\nI mean they have ones on the lower end,\nfor them, lower end.\n\n315\n00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.268\nLower end does not mean that hey,\ngo down to Best Buy and pick one up.\n\n316\n00:18:50.268 --> 00:18:52.967\n>> Yeah that I can afford [LAUGH]\n>> Wrong, you can, I think you\n\n317\n00:18:52.967 --> 00:18:57.980\ncan get them on eBay, used ones off eBay,\nfor like five grand or six grand.\n\n318\n00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.215\nYou can even get them,\n\n319\n00:18:59.215 --> 00:19:03.640\nsometimes see the higher end ones that\nhave been decommissioned for around ten.\n\n320\n00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.130\nIt's still a pretty hefty price tag,\neven for something that's used.\n\n321\n00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:11.553\nBut for the enterprise type situation,\n\n322\n00:19:11.553 --> 00:19:15.203\nthose devices are a big benefit.\n\n323\n00:19:15.203 --> 00:19:20.406\nWhen you get to NetApps devices,\nthey have ones that can\n\n324\n00:19:20.406 --> 00:19:25.393\nstore multiple terabytes and\nabove of information.\n\n325\n00:19:25.393 --> 00:19:28.182\nAnd they have the ability\nto do all the nice\n\n326\n00:19:28.182 --> 00:19:30.830\nthings like hot swapping drives on it.\n\n327\n00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.925\nThey have hot spares where if a drive\nfails they can just move it right over to\n\n328\n00:19:34.925 --> 00:19:37.930\nanother one without you even\nhaving to worry about it.\n\n329\n00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.855\nAnd heck, these devices even have\nthe ability, because they're specially\n\n330\n00:19:41.855 --> 00:19:46.680\nregistered with NetApp,\nonce you've set these things up with them,\n\n331\n00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:53.470\nyou buy the device and you get a nice\nspecial ID number, whatever with it.\n\n332\n00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.910\nAnd that's the one they identify you with.\n\n333\n00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:01.800\nThat system even can essentially call\nhome, if one of those drives fails on it,\n\n334\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.590\nyou just can't go out and\nbuy a drive some place.\n\n335\n00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:10.710\nYou actually have to get the drive\nfrom NetApp to be fully guaranteed and\n\n336\n00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.952\nreap all the benefits, because there\nare a lot of benefits to this.\n\n337\n00:20:13.952 --> 00:20:16.290\nAnd so, that drive fails,\n\n338\n00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:21.380\nit'll move stuff over to another drive,\none of those spares.\n\n339\n00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.020\nBut it will also, at the same time,\ncontact NetApp and tell them,\n\n340\n00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.270\non this particular customer's site,\nthis drive failed,\n\n341\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.805\nof this size,\ngive them all the information.\n\n342\n00:20:30.805 --> 00:20:33.790\nAnd they'll send out a drive to you,\n\n343\n00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:37.980\npretty much no questions asked,\nthere you go.\n\n344\n00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.550\nThere are actually I know people\nhave worked with that technology,\n\n345\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.240\nand they said they've shown up to work,\n\n346\n00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:50.150\nthey've had something fail on\na Friday evening or something.\n\n347\n00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.500\nAnd on Monday morning there's a box\n\n348\n00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.352\nfrom NetApp sitting there that's\ngot the hard drive in it.\n\n349\n00:20:56.352 --> 00:21:03.060\nSo and you didn't get an email or\nanything on it, or a call, or anything.\n\n350\n00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.853\nAll of a sudden, when you go in\nMonday morning, or the next day,\n\n351\n00:21:06.853 --> 00:21:10.950\nyou see that hey, something's failed and\nhere's the drive for it.\n\n352\n00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:14.373\nAll you gotta do is just turn\nthat one drive off, pop this in,\n\n353\n00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:16.806\nturn it back on and walk away, in essence.\n\n354\n00:21:16.806 --> 00:21:20.770\nSo, that's something that you get with,\nand I'm not trying to plug their stuff.\n\n355\n00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:25.220\nI mean, there's other companies\nthat do this sort of thing as well.\n\n356\n00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.150\nBut that's something you're not gonna get\non the lower end storage technologies,\n\n357\n00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.640\nthey just don't do that.\n\n358\n00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.210\nThat's why you pay these tons of bucks and\n\n359\n00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.930\nget all this special\ntraining on these things.\n\n360\n00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.420\nBecause, as an enterprise customer,\n\n361\n00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:45.230\nenterprise environment,\nwhen you get to that scale of knowledge,\n\n362\n00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.580\nyou have the budgets, typically,\nto get that stuff, but it's a necessity.\n\n363\n00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:54.710\nIf you're processing stuff for\ncustomers, you need to have data stay\n\n364\n00:21:54.710 --> 00:22:00.590\navailable all the time, or have\nthe greatest amount of uptime you can.\n\n365\n00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.670\nYou will pay for that, you will pay\nthat extra money for it, if it's\n\n366\n00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.855\nsomething that's only 10,\n20, $30,000, I say only.\n\n367\n00:22:10.855 --> 00:22:12.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Relatively speaking, it's only,\n\n368\n00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.230\nbecause some of these devices\ngo up into the six figure range.\n\n369\n00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:20.400\nAnd if you get all the bells and whistles\nthey go in the seven figure range.\n\n370\n00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.999\nSo, yeah you spend that money because you\njust can't afford to be in a situation\n\n371\n00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:28.844\nwhere something just goes off and\nyou've gotta go figure out where\n\n372\n00:22:28.844 --> 00:22:32.913\nyou're going to get parts for it,\nand how quickly they can get there.\n\n373\n00:22:32.913 --> 00:22:35.510\nIs it gonna be able to support the load,\nand all that.\n\n374\n00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.687\nYou know with any of these enterprise\nsolutions they can do that,\n\n375\n00:22:38.687 --> 00:22:42.385\nin addition to the fact that they also\nhave things like built-in security in\n\n376\n00:22:42.385 --> 00:22:44.820\nthem, and very good built-in security.\n\n377\n00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.440\nThese enterprise storage devices\nare known to even have built-in\n\n378\n00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.780\nencryption into them.\n\n379\n00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.010\nEither built into the actual firmware, or\n\n380\n00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.900\nbuilt directly into the hardware,\nso it's seamless.\n\n381\n00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.140\nAnd if you're processing a lot of data,\n\n382\n00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.710\nthat's gonna really sell itself,\nbecause when it's at the hardware level,\n\n383\n00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:12.190\nit moves a lot faster typically\nthan it does at the software level.\n\n384\n00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.370\nSo that's gonna really be worth\nits weight in gold to you.\n\n385\n00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:19.330\nSo you'll pay the extra money cuz you know\nthe extra money here is gonna translate to\n\n386\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.680\nseveral jumps in performance over here.\n\n387\n00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.160\nAnd hence, you can process more data,\nget more customers taken care of, and\n\n388\n00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:30.600\ntherefore, reap the revenues or\nwhatever it has off of that.\n\n389\n00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.160\nSo enterprise storage, the systems,\nthere's a lot going with them, but\n\n390\n00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.690\nthere's also, you gotta figure out,\ndo you need this.\n\n391\n00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.840\nSome of these things,\ngetting a NetApp device, getting a SAN,\n\n392\n00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.860\nsomething like that.\n\n393\n00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.317\nSounds all well and good,\nI mean you can get into a SAN,\n\n394\n00:23:43.317 --> 00:23:47.295\nI think at one point they said you can\nget into a low-end SAN for like $250,000.\n\n395\n00:23:47.295 --> 00:23:51.784\nI'm sure the number's a little bit\nlower than that now to kinda just\n\n396\n00:23:51.784 --> 00:23:55.250\nget into the shallow end\nof the pool on that.\n\n397\n00:23:55.250 --> 00:24:00.130\nBut the thing is, is that even if I\nsit here and say it's only $250,000.\n\n398\n00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.610\nOh really, it's only $250,000.\n\n399\n00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:07.903\nThat's still,\neven if you have that money to invest\n\n400\n00:24:07.903 --> 00:24:14.172\nin that It's not $250 or\n$50,000 layout on that.\n\n401\n00:24:14.172 --> 00:24:17.609\nYou don't just get someone from the\ngeneral IT population to go over there,\n\n402\n00:24:17.609 --> 00:24:18.800\ntake care of those boxes.\n\n403\n00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.050\nSet that up and do something.\n\n404\n00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:21.630\nIt's not.\n\n405\n00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.780\nThere's teams that take care of that\nhave to be specially trained and\n\n406\n00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:29.180\nthat may be the only thing they do\nif it gets a big enough deployment.\n\n407\n00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:33.780\nThey may not do anything else on\nthe network except manage that thing.\n\n408\n00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:34.635\nThat's there baby.\n\n409\n00:24:34.635 --> 00:24:36.920\nThey take care of it.\n\n410\n00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.170\nUpgrade it.\n\n411\n00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.830\nWhatever, dust it off,\npolish it, whatever.\n\n412\n00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.560\nThey do everything on that.\n\n413\n00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:49.870\nSame thing with the stuff that falls\ninto the category of the netapp devices.\n\n414\n00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.740\nThose people have to go to\nspecial training for that.\n\n415\n00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.930\nAnd I think, just to kinda tell you,\njust kinda put it in perspective,\n\n416\n00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.950\nthe investments that you're looking at,\nif your design enterprise\n\n417\n00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:05.790\nsecurity solution and you decide that I\nwant to have one of these devices and\n\n418\n00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:11.140\nyou've got it in the budget to say\nI've got the $200,000 dollars to spend\n\n419\n00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:15.440\non this device and it does everything\nI need to and I'm happy with that.\n\n420\n00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.260\nSo you go to somebody like\nnetapp buy it and plug it in,\n\n421\n00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.670\nand it's like I've got some\npeople I've got to train.\n\n422\n00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.640\nWell, you're not going to send one person,\n\n423\n00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.980\ntwo people trained,\nyou're gonna send more than that.\n\n424\n00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.440\nLast time I heard a week's worth of\ntrains from Net App stuff was something\n\n425\n00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.310\nfrom $12 to $14 thousand dollars.\n\n426\n00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:36.110\nIt was somewhere in that range.\n\n427\n00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:37.990\nIt may have come down and\n\n428\n00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:42.210\nthe thing is that you can only go to\nspecific people even to get that.\n\n429\n00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.900\nSo when you-\n>> That's on top of the cost you've\n\n430\n00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.360\nalready spent on the device.\n\n431\n00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:46.930\n>> Yeah.\n\n432\n00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:50.980\nThat's an additional cost and when they do\nany upgrades to it you're also gonna be\n\n433\n00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.510\npaying to send them back to that.\n\n434\n00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:57.890\nSo you may buy one of those devices,\nyou've got to pay that stuff,\n\n435\n00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.720\nyou've got to pay travel because\nthere's only a small number of places\n\n436\n00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.780\nin the country, and I'm talking U.S.\nhere, that even offer that training.\n\n437\n00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.360\nThey have to be specifically blessed\nby net app to offer that and\n\n438\n00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.700\nhave the trainers all specially\ntrained by net app and\n\n439\n00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:17.670\ngo through way bunch of stuff,\nand so because of all that,\n\n440\n00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.980\nthat's a lot of cost you're getting\njust by buying something like that.\n\n441\n00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:26.530\nSo when you design it and you're somebody\nthat the cast is targeted towards,\n\n442\n00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:30.940\nbudgets are part of your responsibilities\n\n443\n00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.090\nThose are all costs that are part of it,\nbut are not right there on paper.\n\n444\n00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.490\nYou're going to have to factor those in.\n\n445\n00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.160\nYou're going to have to figure out,\nhey, if you've got four people,\n\n446\n00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.300\nwhat four people can you pull out,\nand send them out there.\n\n447\n00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:47.290\nAnd maybe you're some place, I was in\na netapp training class at one point.\n\n448\n00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:52.000\nI keep bringing them up, but it's really\none of the better examples of it.\n\n449\n00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.390\nPeople had to come in from places like in\nEurope to Northern California to train.\n\n450\n00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:58.500\nCan you imagine that?\n\n451\n00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:03.040\nHaving to go, go ahead,\ncross a whole ocean and\n\n452\n00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.865\npassports are involved to do all that,\nthat's a lot of expense and\n\n453\n00:27:07.865 --> 00:27:11.645\ntime and everything that goes with that.\n\n454\n00:27:11.645 --> 00:27:13.365\nSo there's a lot of things and\n\n455\n00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:17.955\nenterprise storage is kind of\na rarefied air, unique environment.\n\n456\n00:27:17.955 --> 00:27:22.765\nNow the cool thing about it, that bar is\nstarting to, the costs are starting to\n\n457\n00:27:22.765 --> 00:27:28.380\ncome down because you look at stuff like\nWindows has those things like iScuzzy,\n\n458\n00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:35.520\ninitiators built into it that you\ncan use to target those devices and\n\n459\n00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.580\nthen those companies start making their\nown custom ones that open up more\n\n460\n00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.730\nstuff on their device so you don't\nnecessarily in the case of some of these\n\n461\n00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.740\nthings used to use Custom\ndistros of Linux, so\n\n462\n00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.510\nnow you have to train someone on Linux,\nthat may have never touched it before.\n\n463\n00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.680\nAnd have to train them all the specific\ncommands for that storage device.\n\n464\n00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.630\nSo they realize that hey maybe\nthat's not the best thing.\n\n465\n00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:02.660\nWe'll still leave the Linux stuff in\nthere, but we'll also make a Windows GUI\n\n466\n00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:08.050\nand nice stuff in there, so\nit's more accessible to people, but still,\n\n467\n00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:12.700\nthey're gonna require some level\nof training with stuff like that.\n\n468\n00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.790\nAnd, some cases it's not easy to get.\n\n469\n00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.660\nI mean heck, some of these devices.\n\n470\n00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:23.160\nAnd some of these systems you get, because\nof the way they've structured their stuff,\n\n471\n00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.870\nnot only do you have to go run\na training there sounds like can't\n\n472\n00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.170\nset up a class if you don't have the time.\n\n473\n00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.050\nWhat have people done in the past?\n\n474\n00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.950\nThey have bought a book or\nsomething on it.\n\n475\n00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:34.970\nBut guess what?\n\n476\n00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:36.910\nSome of these things don't\neven have books on them.\n\n477\n00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:41.620\nThey're actually, all the stuff is\nproprietary and anybody that tries to\n\n478\n00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.860\nwrite a book they will just pound them\ninto the ground saying, no you're not.\n\n479\n00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.980\nWhat will happen is that you are stuck.\n\n480\n00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.380\nYou go to their classes or\nyou just suck it up and\n\n481\n00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.920\nfigure it out on your own or don't buy it.\n\n482\n00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.740\nWell-\n>> That's it.\n\n483\n00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.010\n>> Alright,\nwell a lot of good information there.\n\n484\n00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:01.530\nTalked about virtualization, talked about\nVLANs, talked about enterprise storage.\n\n485\n00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:02.900\nBut, we are about out of time.\n\n486\n00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.660\nSo, anything else you want\nto through in there Sean?\n\n487\n00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.930\n>> No, I think we kind of hit it.\n\n488\n00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.140\nWe covered a lot of ground\nat enterprise security.\n\n489\n00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.230\nAnd the cloud and virtualization stuff.\n\n490\n00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:13.110\nI think we kinda got it.\n\n491\n00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.160\nIt's up to you guys now.\n\n492\n00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.900\n>> Well alright, ladies and gentleman I\nhope you've guys enjoyed this episode.\n\n493\n00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.280\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n494\n00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.147\n>> And I'm Seana Riano.\n\n495\n00:29:21.147 --> 00:29:22.319\n>> And

00:00:15.000\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.430\nAnd with me today is Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.520\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.270\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n7\n00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.090\nHow are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.000\n>> I'm doing fantastic,\nexcited to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.900\nContinuing on on our cast for our CompTia\nAdvanced Security Practitioner episodes.\n\n10\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.940\nIn this episode Sean, we are gonna\nbe talking about host securities.\n\n11\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.400\nSound like a pretty important part\nof designing a secure network.\n\n12\n00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.940\n>> Yeah, absolutely is when you look\nat the hosts, or just to kinda clarify,\n\n13\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.490\nwe're talking about the individual\nsystems on there and we could even\n\n14\n00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.500\ngo out there and narrow that down to,\nwe can talk about individual systems.\n\n15\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.210\nUsually, when people like a host,\n\n16\n00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.170\nthey tend to think of stuff like\nthe client systems but really, we just\n\n17\n00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.430\nput it down to anything that's plugging\ninto the, that's part of the network.\n\n18\n00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.880\nIn our case has an address or\nsomething assigned to it.\n\n19\n00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.590\nSometimes they use the term node,\ndon't hear that as much for\n\n20\n00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.850\nsome reason as I used to and\nI don't know why that is, but\n\n21\n00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.820\nIt's something that's, in the very generic\nsense, is plugged into the network.\n\n22\n00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.820\nIf we start backing off from that a bit,\nthen we start seeing that does\n\n23\n00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.160\ninclude clients, servers, printers, and\njust a whole kind of mixed bag of things.\n\n24\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.630\nAnd Mixed bag is actually kind of right,\nI mean,\n\n25\n00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.300\nhow many different things can you\nplug in your network today, right.\n\n26\n00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.040\nIt's crazy.\n\n27\n00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.250\n>> And it's all got to be secure.\n\n28\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.040\nAnd we've got to worry about each and\nevery one of them.\n\n29\n00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.385\nBecause they all bring vulnerabilities.\n\n30\n00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.900\nSo different types of host,\nI know you've got a nice little list here.\n\n31\n00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.990\nObviously clients and servers, but\nthings you might not think about like,\n\n32\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.390\ncameras is another one\nyou've got there listed.\n\n33\n00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.960\n>> Yeah, I was trying to kinda,\nwhen I was making a brief list of things,\n\n34\n00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.990\nit's easy to point out the clients server,\npart of it, because that's there.\n\n35\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.430\nWe can see that, we interact with them all\nthe time, that's perfectly understandable.\n\n36\n00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.920\nPrinter, same type of deal,\nwe know those hosts are out there.\n\n37\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.530\nBut now thanks to this whole\nidea of Internet enabling and\n\n38\n00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.870\nall different sorts of things,\nwhy making them wireless capable.\n\n39\n00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.870\nJust about wherever you look, you got\njust a tremendous range of hosts and\n\n40\n00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.360\none of the ones are cameras.\n\n41\n00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.740\nAnd cameras are one that you\ncan pick up actually fairly\n\n42\n00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.060\neasily if you wanna get down to it.\n\n43\n00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.090\nIt was mentioned in the chat room I saw,\nwhen you guys were having your discussion\n\n44\n00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.640\non Windows 10, I saw about about\nusing showdown in the search engine,\n\n45\n00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.860\nwhich we also showed in\nthe ethical hacking course.\n\n46\n00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.630\nIf you recall, when we're in a showdown,\nthat was an ethical hacking course.\n\n47\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.548\nWe saw that showdown would actually\nallow us to view different pieces\n\n48\n00:02:59.548 --> 00:03:04.460\nof hardware and we could do\nqueries on it and customize it.\n\n49\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.880\nIt would pull out under\nthe right conditions,\n\n50\n00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.220\nif you knew what cameras\nyou were looking for or\n\n51\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.750\nwhat specific type of host you were\nlooking for, it's gonna find it.\n\n52\n00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.670\nIf it's in their system, then they\ncan crawl it, they will find it and\n\n53\n00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.540\nthen we can step right over to\nthe mainstream stuff because not everyone\n\n54\n00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.670\nis gonna know about a tool like\nthe showdown search engine.\n\n55\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.660\nYou only have to use Google and\ndo some Google hacking to find\n\n56\n00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.053\nhosts that are attached to a network that\nare exposed in ways they shouldn't be.\n\n57\n00:03:38.053 --> 00:03:44.590\nCameras are one that you can actually\nvery easily find with Google hacking,\n\n58\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.540\nand the way you do it is you do stuff\nlike you search for things like\n\n59\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.250\nthe administration page or a string value\nfor the camera model you're looking for.\n\n60\n00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.900\nYou can do things that will actually\ncause it to pop up and say, okay, well,\n\n61\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.970\nthere it is.\n\n62\n00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.730\nAnd so with a few other key words,\n\n63\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.460\nyou can narrow that search down\nto a specific domain name.\n\n64\n00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.320\nAnd at that point,\nyou've got that client nailed down and\n\n65\n00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.540\nyou can start potentially clicking on\nsecurity cameras and stuff like that.\n\n66\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.640\nIt's actually kind of scary when you get\ndown to it, especially considering what\n\n67\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.140\nthese security systems and cameras will be\nmade available to do physical security.\n\n68\n00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.430\nMore and more places are pushing that and\n\n69\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.660\nthey're adapting stuff that shouldn't\nbe used in those environments.\n\n70\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.785\nThey're putting them\ninto those environments.\n\n71\n00:04:34.785 --> 00:04:39.970\nRemember taking cameras that are best\nused in a consumer environment and\n\n72\n00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.050\nhave security appropriate for that and\nthey may just be saying, oh well,\n\n73\n00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.580\nI'm gonna plug it into our environment and\n\n74\n00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.140\nnot think of the fact that you're\nusing the wrong tool for the job.\n\n75\n00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.210\nYou should be buying something that has a\nlittle more heft, a little more weight in\n\n76\n00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.300\nthe security side than it would be\nnecessary for a consumer to have.\n\n77\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.174\nAnd so people have found cameras and use\nthat to monitor stuff inside a building\n\n78\n00:05:03.174 --> 00:05:07.310\nand see who is there, who is not there.\n\n79\n00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.941\nThat can get really kind of frightening,\nthen on top of that,\n\n80\n00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:16.319\nit doesn't require someone\nbreaking into your network.\n\n81\n00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:20.240\nThere's been multiple\ncases where someone has,\n\n82\n00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.719\nor a company rather,\nhas had a camera on their network and\n\n83\n00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:29.289\nthey left it open in such a way\nthat someone could come in and\n\n84\n00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.610\nget in over the Internet and\njust access that camera.\n\n85\n00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.194\nI actually literally knew someone that,\nand it wasn't me.\n\n86\n00:05:37.194 --> 00:05:39.400\n[LAUGH] But I wish I had.\n\n87\n00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.733\nNo, no,\nI know someone that was able to punch into\n\n88\n00:05:43.733 --> 00:05:47.900\nthe cameras inside of like a Walgreens.\n\n89\n00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.580\nThey have a physical store, they were\nactually able to punch into the camera\n\n90\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.140\nthere and actually able to gain control\nof the camera and pan about the store.\n\n91\n00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.670\nSomeone was asleep at the wheel when\nthey set that thing up, let me tell you.\n\n92\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.600\nSo that was one that was a real\neye opener, when you saw that and\n\n93\n00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.880\nthat just is continued on.\n\n94\n00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.590\nBut then, if we move away from the camera\nstuff, let's talk about the printer issue.\n\n95\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.750\nWhen we went through ethical hacking,\nwe saw many tools where we could\n\n96\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.130\nplug into printers and view print queues\nand see what was going on with them.\n\n97\n00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.960\nAnd well, both showed and Google and\nusing Google hacking can also\n\n98\n00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.150\nreveal printers that are have exposure\nin ways that they shouldn't be having.\n\n99\n00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.214\nThat's another very common one,\nused to be able to find some,\n\n100\n00:06:39.214 --> 00:06:43.290\na whole host of, what they called that,\nwhat is one for Apple?\n\n101\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.270\nThe phaser printer?\n\n102\n00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.798\nSomething like that.\n\n103\n00:06:46.798 --> 00:06:51.610\nThese are printer that, I think are called\na phaser or something like that.\n\n104\n00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.720\nThey had a printer that if\nyou searched for that string,\n\n105\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.390\nit would actually puke out\na bunch of results in Google.\n\n106\n00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.094\nAnd a lot you could just click on and\nsee the control panel and console and\n\n107\n00:07:01.094 --> 00:07:01.850\neverything.\n\n108\n00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.973\nAll the stuff that you\nsee through a browser and\n\n109\n00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:05.780\nthat might pop up right on your screen.\n\n110\n00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.160\nAnd so what can you do with that?\n\n111\n00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:15.520\nWell, let's say I could probably intercept\nprint jobs and do that sort of stuff.\n\n112\n00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.600\nThat could be bad enough in itself,\nif I could get copies of print jobs.\n\n113\n00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.424\nWe have tools that we saw in ethical\nhacking that all you got to do is punch in\n\n114\n00:07:23.424 --> 00:07:24.236\nan IP address.\n\n115\n00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:28.872\nAnd if you can give the right credentials\nor if it can just plug in directly,\n\n116\n00:07:28.872 --> 00:07:31.888\nyou can tell it whatever\nthat goes through this,\n\n117\n00:07:31.888 --> 00:07:36.730\nthis printer grabs the print queue and\nright to PDF and send it to me.\n\n118\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.877\nAnd me, at the same time,\nlet the person have their print job and\n\n119\n00:07:39.877 --> 00:07:41.290\nthey will be none the wiser.\n\n120\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:46.845\nSo having these different types of hosts\non there are something that should\n\n121\n00:07:46.845 --> 00:07:53.297\nactually make you think about what type of\nsecurity you're providing or can provide.\n\n122\n00:07:53.297 --> 00:07:58.844\nSo ask yourself when you plug a host\ninto your network, Can you reasonably\n\n123\n00:07:58.844 --> 00:08:04.035\nsecure that or is it something that\nyou need to really have so much that\n\n124\n00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:10.510\nyou're willing to put up with somebody's\nholes that are gonna come with it.\n\n125\n00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.550\nAnd you might find some interesting\nthings as a result of that.\n\n126\n00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.656\nPeople plug all sorts of crazy\nstuff in their networks and\n\n127\n00:08:18.656 --> 00:08:22.087\njust do not think about\nit until it's too late.\n\n128\n00:08:22.087 --> 00:08:26.200\nThat is not what you want to have,\nit's definitely not what you want to have.\n\n129\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.777\n>> What is our solution there?\n\n130\n00:08:27.777 --> 00:08:29.870\nWhat do we try to do to fix this?\n\n131\n00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.340\nThere is a lot of them.\n\n132\n00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.698\nThere is a lot of solutions.\n\n133\n00:08:32.698 --> 00:08:38.550\nThe easiest one would be, read the darn\ninstructions when you get it, right?\n\n134\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.250\nPay attention to what they have.\n\n135\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.885\nMost of these systems do have basic\nsecurity measures provided for them.\n\n136\n00:08:45.885 --> 00:08:49.986\nI'm not talking the computers now.\n\n137\n00:08:49.986 --> 00:08:52.810\nI'm talking just these other\nthings like the cameras,\n\n138\n00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:57.330\nlike the printers, like these little\nthings that you can see plugged in.\n\n139\n00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.140\nI'm even thinking about of\nthe off-the-wall stuff, the novelty stuff.\n\n140\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.670\nI think I've mentioned it\nin here a couple times.\n\n141\n00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:10.370\nI mean you could see them, find them\non eBay, those little goal lights that\n\n142\n00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.530\nlook like the ones in hockey, and so\nyou can plug a wireless card into it, and\n\n143\n00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.750\nyou can hook it up to your\nwireless network, and\n\n144\n00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.080\njust tell it what team you want to watch,\nor what team's your favorite, and\n\n145\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.710\nany time they score a goal,\nthat red light will go off.\n\n146\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:30.210\nIt's kind of an interesting and\ncool kind of thing to see,\n\n147\n00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.510\nbut I've never once heard him talk about\nanything to do with security more than\n\n148\n00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:38.040\na little bit with those so\ncould you get into it?\n\n149\n00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.550\nPossibly, it's the same thing with this\nhome automation stuff too, there's like,\n\n150\n00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.220\nthose things they don't\nreally talk about security.\n\n151\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.490\nThat's de-emphasized, it's hey look\nyour thermostat can do this and\n\n152\n00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.480\nyou can put a camera over your, over the\npeep hole in the door of your house and\n\n153\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.640\ndo all this stuff.\n\n154\n00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.440\nSo, most of those things, even though they\ndon't talk about security as the main\n\n155\n00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:05.040\nthing, there's usually something there\nin the vain of security that you can do.\n\n156\n00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.980\nAnd they may be just simple\nas setting a password.\n\n157\n00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.200\nThat's gonna get you something on it.\n\n158\n00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.680\nAlso, ask yourself, do you need to\nmake these things internet facing?\n\n159\n00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.700\nWhy a camera's internet facing,\nthat's monitoring your premises,\n\n160\n00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.890\nthat should be a no brainer,\nwhy is that why would you\n\n161\n00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:25.280\nhave that in your situation that would\nprobably be first thing I'd be looking at.\n\n162\n00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.630\nI don't care about the web interface the\nbrowser interface it's like I said before\n\n163\n00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.000\nwith interfaces I want to hear browser\ninterfaces, cause that's what it is,\n\n164\n00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.180\nweb immediately gets association.\n\n165\n00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.420\nThat should be going out in\nthe Internet and it shouldn't be so\n\n166\n00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.840\nwe don't wanna see that.\n\n167\n00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.960\nAnd then if you have these\nsituations where you have a device\n\n168\n00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:51.815\nthat just doesn't have adequate\nsecurity in of itself, well,\n\n169\n00:10:51.815 --> 00:10:56.935\nwe have talked about other\nsolutions to provide security.\n\n170\n00:10:56.935 --> 00:10:59.985\nThe demo you did yesterday,\nMike, on IP sec.\n\n171\n00:10:59.985 --> 00:11:05.162\nThat was actually a really great\none because you could use that\n\n172\n00:11:05.162 --> 00:11:08.952\nto potentially secure stuff where\nthere's no security on its own.\n\n173\n00:11:08.952 --> 00:11:12.832\nOf course, you do have that requirement\nthat that host you're plugging in does\n\n174\n00:11:12.832 --> 00:11:18.872\nsupport IPsec, but then again you at least\nwanna check to see if that's an option.\n\n175\n00:11:18.872 --> 00:11:20.489\nIf that's not an option, who knows?\n\n176\n00:11:20.489 --> 00:11:25.420\nMaybe you segment out a network and\nput those things on that network.\n\n177\n00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.340\nSo you have to think about that.\n\n178\n00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.310\nAnd one more thing I put\non this list of clients is,\n\n179\n00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.790\nbecause we could go on forever and ever\nabout all these exotic-type clients, and\n\n180\n00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.895\nI'm not gonna go down that road.\n\n181\n00:11:37.895 --> 00:11:43.965\nBut I could also factor into this,\nwhat about those untrusted hosts?\n\n182\n00:11:43.965 --> 00:11:49.628\nAnd when I talk untrusted hosts, or maybe\nwe could call them guests on your network.\n\n183\n00:11:49.628 --> 00:11:53.795\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You have people that bring in their own\n\n184\n00:11:53.795 --> 00:11:57.957\ncomputers and laptops and\nthey don't think about it.\n\n185\n00:11:57.957 --> 00:12:03.080\nTo them, it's just a new toy to them or\nit's the way they work or what have you.\n\n186\n00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.370\nThey come in and\nthey just start using on your network and\n\n187\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.500\nit may be just as simple they're just\ngonna see if there's a cable some place or\n\n188\n00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.330\nan open jack some place and they're gonna\nplug it in and as far as they're concerned\n\n189\n00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.440\nthey got network access and they'll start\nbrowsing the internet and typing away and\n\n190\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.540\ndoing whatever, and it shouldn't be there.\n\n191\n00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.970\nIt should be something that they ask\npermission you should not have someone\n\n192\n00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:29.660\njust physically walking in from wherever\nand just plugging something in.\n\n193\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.890\nAnd I didn't even care if that person's\njust walking in from wherever,\n\n194\n00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:37.980\nif it's something that works for your\ncompany they shouldn't be allowed just to\n\n195\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.690\nplug something in without any rhyme or\nreason.\n\n196\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.100\nJust that hey, I'm gonna put it there.\n\n197\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.110\nSo that's another big, big problem.\n\n198\n00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.600\nThe way to deal with a lot of that now\nis some things like port security,\n\n199\n00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.410\nso they can make sure those\ndevices just can't attach.\n\n200\n00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:01.510\nThey plug in, they will not get any\nconnectivity, and then they also have for\n\n201\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.790\nwireless, it's not uncommon for\na company to set up a guest wireless.\n\n202\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.280\nThat's becoming a more\ncommon thing to set up and\n\n203\n00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.820\nwhere they'll have the main network that's\ngot everything that they need on it.\n\n204\n00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.010\nIt may even have its own\nwireless access point on it.\n\n205\n00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.130\nBut then they have\na separate compartmentalized\n\n206\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.710\nguest wireless network that these hosts\ncoming in from the outside can attach to.\n\n207\n00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.100\nAnd it still may require a password on it,\ntypically it does.\n\n208\n00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.970\nBut what happens is,\nis when they plug into it,\n\n209\n00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:36.280\nsince it's segregated from the rest of the\nnetwork, they can't jump over into that.\n\n210\n00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.418\nBut they still get just basic things,\n\n211\n00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:41.520\nessentially internet\naccess is what it's for.\n\n212\n00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:47.680\nIt may be something that just\ngives them that basic access so\n\n213\n00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.030\nthey can browse stuff like Wikipedia or\n\n214\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.570\ncollect emails or\nwhat have you and that's it.\n\n215\n00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:59.330\nEven though you can use port\nsecurity to plug directly in,\n\n216\n00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.730\ndon't give them your main WiFi password.\n\n217\n00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.870\nGive them the guest one and call it a day.\n\n218\n00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.950\nThat way you are a lot more secure.\n\n219\n00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.610\nThere are strategies to\ndeal with this stuff,\n\n220\n00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:15.798\neven if it's something that doesn't\nprovide adequate security on its own.\n\n221\n00:14:15.798 --> 00:14:19.540\nIt's something that\n\n222\n00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:24.070\nyou can't address through mixing\nother technologies into the mix.\n\n223\n00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:30.880\nYou probably, a lot of the techniques\nyou probably already have in hand.\n\n224\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.460\nAlso remember, it's very easy to\nidentify a host and where hosts are,\n\n225\n00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.140\nso all I need is to find a host\nto use as an entry point and\n\n226\n00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.320\nthen I may not be after\nthat specific host,\n\n227\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.450\nI may be using that as a way\nto get in through that hole,\n\n228\n00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:53.160\nand then start scanning the rest of\nthe network to see what's out there.\n\n229\n00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.440\nYou know so and\nonce I start finding that out and\n\n230\n00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.246\nfinding what's available then I can start\ntargeting some specific vulnerabilities.\n\n231\n00:15:00.246 --> 00:15:02.770\nRemember from Metasploit stuff,\n\n232\n00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:07.250\nonce we did our initial scans and\nfound out what systems are out there,\n\n233\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.600\nwe could use Metasploit to\npotentially to start targeting\n\n234\n00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:16.210\nexploits toward systems to take them\nover or to damage them or what have you.\n\n235\n00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.750\nThat's kind of where we're headed.\n\n236\n00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.045\nI know I said a mouthful there,\nbut that's where things are going.\n\n237\n00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.620\n>> [LAUGH] So\nwe've got to discover those hosts,\n\n238\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.760\nand we've got to harden those hosts,\nand I know you've got an example for\n\n239\n00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.860\nus of showing us what kind\nof things we might see?\n\n240\n00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:36.500\n>> What i'm going to do here, is first\nof all before I go directly into this,\n\n241\n00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.433\nI\n>> I can tell you, we've seen this stuff\n\n242\n00:15:40.433 --> 00:15:44.642\nbefore but\nto just re-acquaint you with it,\n\n243\n00:15:44.642 --> 00:15:48.763\nhow easy it is to find\nthese hosts out there.\n\n244\n00:15:48.763 --> 00:15:55.753\nSomething else I kind of want to point out\nis that you do have it, a Kali NetHunter.\n\n245\n00:15:55.753 --> 00:16:00.840\nAnd you also have something that\nyou can put in to Cayley itself.\n\n246\n00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.640\nThey do have one tool that\nspecifically looks for cameras.\n\n247\n00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.600\nYou can actually find one\nin the Google Play store,\n\n248\n00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:15.350\nif you poke around enough you will find\na utility in there that can help you\n\n249\n00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.970\nsweep a network and look for\nthe signatures of a camera.\n\n250\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.850\nAnd it'll tell you hey,\nhere's the cameras that are out there and\n\n251\n00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:28.380\nonce they're out there you can start\ntrying to target those specifically and\n\n252\n00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.400\nsee if you can attach to them, and\nif anything's coming off of them.\n\n253\n00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:37.130\nIt can be kind of a nasty\nthing when it gets down to it.\n\n254\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:42.870\nSo yeah, let's take a quick\nlook at a couple things here.\n\n255\n00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.290\nWhat I have done is I have two tools,\n\n256\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:51.790\nI've already run a scan with one of them,\njust to kind of reacquaint you with it.\n\n257\n00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.220\nOf course, we've got Kali Linux and\n\n258\n00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.640\nthen this is Zenmap, which is just\nthe graphical frontend for Nmap.\n\n259\n00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.970\nAnd this is just to show you again,\nif you forgot about this, or\n\n260\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:07.560\njust need to be reacquainted with it,\nI just chose one IP address.\n\n261\n00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.720\nI only brought up one of\nthe hosts on my network here.\n\n262\n00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.900\nSo what I've done is I just\nhave that metasploitable system\n\n263\n00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.200\nout there because it just gives\nme some interesting results.\n\n264\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.710\nIt's not always gonna be that easy.\n\n265\n00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.280\nI mean, let's Let's just face it,\n\n266\n00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.820\nthat metasploitable system is\non really unsteady ground.\n\n267\n00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.520\nI can sneeze, it'll fall over.\n\n268\n00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.770\nSo, it's meant to be like that.\n\n269\n00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:35.090\nSo I just went ahead and scanned that and\n\n270\n00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:40.100\nI've got my scan being done, told me\nthe open ports and stuff like that on it.\n\n271\n00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.060\nOkay, so that gave me that, but\nonce I start going through here,\n\n272\n00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.040\nsome additional services,\nit's the exact type of stuff\n\n273\n00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.930\nthat you would like to see if\nyou're scanning a range of hosts.\n\n274\n00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.670\nI could have put in a whole IP range.\n\n275\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.950\nI could have done on that\nIP in the command line,\n\n276\n00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.580\nyou could see the command\nstring up towards the top.\n\n277\n00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:02.070\nI could have done for that last\none I could have done like /24 or\n\n278\n00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:06.940\n/16 and swept that whole range of\nIPs to find the hosts that are live.\n\n279\n00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.050\nAnd each one of those done\na specific scan on it.\n\n280\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:10.770\nDidn't do that,\n\n281\n00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.420\ndon't need to do it because I know that\nthere is only that one host out there and\n\n282\n00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:19.719\nthat would be actually incredibly noisy\nto do in real life, so I didn't do it.\n\n283\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:26.040\nBut I've got stuff here that told\nme that host is indeed vulnerable.\n\n284\n00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.200\nI'm getting information on the services,\nso that's getting me deeper and\n\n285\n00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.210\ndeeper into this.\n\n286\n00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:37.920\nI've got domain information,\nI've got information about,\n\n287\n00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:43.750\nthere's the certificate information\nit's pulled and returned to me.\n\n288\n00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.021\nSo I'm seeing some of that with\nthe keys and all those things on it.\n\n289\n00:18:47.021 --> 00:18:53.001\nAnd as we keep going down there's some\nmore information we get RPC info and\n\n290\n00:18:53.001 --> 00:18:54.410\nNetBIOS info.\n\n291\n00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:59.610\nThere's some Java stuff it looks like in\nthere, and then as I keep going down,\n\n292\n00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.510\nits got MySQL running on it.\n\n293\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.470\nYou know, so we're identifying quite\na bit just by targeting this one.\n\n294\n00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.500\nSo if you found this as an exposed host,\n\n295\n00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.870\nyou already have, by looking at this,\nyou've got these exposures.\n\n296\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.020\nYou've got a lot of\npotential ways to get in.\n\n297\n00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:22.680\nYou're just gonna have to start targeting\nand choosing which way you're gonna do it.\n\n298\n00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.840\nAnd as you get down even further you can\nsee that down towards the bottom it's\n\n299\n00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.190\ngot the Mac address on there, and it's\nrun some other queries on it saying yeah,\n\n300\n00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.860\nI've identified this as Linux.\n\n301\n00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.720\nAnd you can go down further,\nit's telling you even more,\n\n302\n00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.290\nthere's a Samba version number.\n\n303\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.160\nThis would be stuff that,\nif I targeted any specific host and\n\n304\n00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.730\ndid an intense scan like this,\nI could expect to get information.\n\n305\n00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.140\nMaybe not as much, but\nexpect to get something back.\n\n306\n00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.890\nProbably, at the very least,\n\n307\n00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.980\nin most cases you get information\nabout what OS is there.\n\n308\n00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.300\nAnd if that OS gives you stuff\nlike service pack information or\n\n309\n00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.260\nbuild information, that is getting\nto the point where you've got\n\n310\n00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.040\na pretty good amount of information\njust with that to go on.\n\n311\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.290\nCuz you could start doing some research\non that to see what vulnerabilities might\n\n312\n00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.490\nbe there.\n\n313\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.320\nAnd seeing if it's something that\nyou could take advantage of.\n\n314\n00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:21.460\nIt just happens to this, I'm getting\nthat plus a bunch of other stuff\n\n315\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.690\non top of it which is just,\nif I'm a blackhat, looking at this,\n\n316\n00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.820\nI'm drooling right now because I don't\neven know what I want to go after first.\n\n317\n00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.920\nThere's just so much stuff.\n\n318\n00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:38.300\nSo that would be looking at\nsomething like Nmap to do this.\n\n319\n00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:43.905\nBut, like I said, Nmap is not the only\none that can do something like this.\n\n320\n00:20:43.905 --> 00:20:48.045\nThere are other tools that give you\ninformation that might be useful.\n\n321\n00:20:48.045 --> 00:20:53.085\nLet's just say we had a host\n\n322\n00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:59.170\nthat we want to identify and\nretrieve information out of and\n\n323\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:04.540\nwe didn't want to do something like Nmap,\nmaybe to get the information\n\n324\n00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.910\nto Nmap would be too intrusive, or\njust send out too many red flags.\n\n325\n00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.480\nWe want to do something that's a little\nlower profile, you can do that.\n\n326\n00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:20.080\nThe tool I use for that is this guy\nover here, is something called p0f.\n\n327\n00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:27.013\nWhat I did is I went ahead and started,\nyou can see right at the red prompt there,\n\n328\n00:21:27.013 --> 00:21:30.150\nit's p0f is actually what they call it,\nand\n\n329\n00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:34.383\nI told it just to listen to\nanything that's coming on eth0.\n\n330\n00:21:34.383 --> 00:21:39.090\nSo that's my connection out of this thing.\n\n331\n00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:43.960\nWhat happens is it loads up a p0f,\nit's got a database on it and\n\n332\n00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.168\nit will start looking at the traffic\nas it goes back and forth.\n\n333\n00:21:47.168 --> 00:21:49.700\nSo anything that goes out of that,\nanything that comes back,\n\n334\n00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.180\nit's gonna try to fingerprint,\nsee what it can find and\n\n335\n00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.190\nit will display information\nas it goes through.\n\n336\n00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:59.540\nI could pipe this right out to a file\nif I wanted, I didn't do it here.\n\n337\n00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.950\nI just displayed it on\nthe screen here to make it easy.\n\n338\n00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:11.610\nSo, what I have is I went out and\nI typed into my web browser.\n\n339\n00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:15.902\nI typed in the address, and\nit starts setting up the connection, and\n\n340\n00:22:15.902 --> 00:22:19.972\nthen I start seeing okay, there's,\nright here on this screen,\n\n341\n00:22:19.972 --> 00:22:23.154\nI see there's the request going out for\nmy system.\n\n342\n00:22:23.154 --> 00:22:27.459\nSo it says Firefox,\nit identified it as that so,\n\n343\n00:22:27.459 --> 00:22:33.080\nis that enough when it says,\napp is Firefox 10x or newer?\n\n344\n00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:38.420\nWell, if I go through the list which says,\nraw_sig in there,\n\n345\n00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.160\nI can start seeing other\ninformation about my host.\n\n346\n00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.740\nIt says, Gecko Firefox, it's the browser,\nbut when I start seeing some of that stuff\n\n347\n00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.912\nit makes me start wondering, oh well,\nwhat's the operating system on there?\n\n348\n00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:56.270\nAnd if you look, you can actually\nsee it's got towards the end of\n\n349\n00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:00.100\nthat line just before the bottom of\nthe first tag, it says X11, right here,\n\n350\n00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.843\nand it says Linux, and it says X86_64.\n\n351\n00:23:04.843 --> 00:23:09.250\nSo, we know it's a Linux operating system,\nso we've got that.\n\n352\n00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.680\nBut, on the other side, so\n\n353\n00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.760\nthat's going out if I go down\nhere just a little bit more.\n\n354\n00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.300\nScrolled up just a little too quickly,\nI guess I got a little excited.\n\n355\n00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:27.678\nSo that's the response going out and\nthen coming back and what we see in here.\n\n356\n00:23:27.678 --> 00:23:32.010\nWell, the thing coming back from this\nthing is saying it's an Apache server.\n\n357\n00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:39.683\nSo, all I did is I just said hey,\nthis is the URL I want to go to,\n\n358\n00:23:39.683 --> 00:23:46.679\nit resolved it just like it always\nwould whether I had this on or not.\n\n359\n00:23:46.679 --> 00:23:50.778\nIt sent something out, it fingerprinted\nit, and sent something back and\n\n360\n00:23:50.778 --> 00:23:51.912\nfingerprinted it.\n\n361\n00:23:51.912 --> 00:23:54.999\nAnd so we are finding out about that host.\n\n362\n00:23:54.999 --> 00:23:57.430\nSo who is the host?\n\n363\n00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:01.190\nWell, all I did is I just browsed\nto one of my favorite websites.\n\n364\n00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.975\nI go here everyday.\n\n365\n00:24:01.975 --> 00:24:06.845\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I just put in this website and\n\n366\n00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:09.955\nthis was just the stuff\ngoing on behind the scenes.\n\n367\n00:24:09.955 --> 00:24:13.435\nNow, there was more than that going on,\nbut\n\n368\n00:24:13.435 --> 00:24:16.745\nI did get a good amount of\ninformation just off of that.\n\n369\n00:24:16.745 --> 00:24:18.157\nI know about the host.\n\n370\n00:24:18.157 --> 00:24:22.557\n>> If I was to go out and\ndo P0F or just a ping or\n\n371\n00:24:22.557 --> 00:24:27.627\ncraft a specific packet I could\nactually turn on P0F and do that too.\n\n372\n00:24:27.627 --> 00:24:29.527\nAnd what would happen is\nthat pack that went out and\n\n373\n00:24:29.527 --> 00:24:31.340\ncame back would also fingerprint it.\n\n374\n00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.780\nSo if you couldn't get it directly and\n\n375\n00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:38.070\nyou couldn't get that system to respond,\nyou could try one of the other,\n\n376\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.790\nyou could try doing another protocol and\nsee if that would actually help out.\n\n377\n00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:45.570\nNow if I kind of wanted to\nbe a little bit messier.\n\n378\n00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.710\nLet me go through, what is it,\nCLS clears the screen.\n\n379\n00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.610\nI forget.\nWhy do I always forget that term?\n\n380\n00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:52.210\n>> Clear.\n\n381\n00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.420\n>> Is it clear?\n\n382\n00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:53.920\nOkay.\n\n383\n00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.570\n>> So Windows creeping back in.\n\n384\n00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.810\n>> But I'm just gonna tell it\nto make it all nice and clear.\n\n385\n00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:04.640\nSo there it is.\n\n386\n00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.590\nIt's sitting there, listening.\n\n387\n00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:12.400\nLet's go back and\nrevisit something from yesterday.\n\n388\n00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.062\nI like that,\nhe's saying Sean Oriyano sucks.\n\n389\n00:25:16.062 --> 00:25:18.252\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I like that, I own that.\n\n390\n00:25:18.252 --> 00:25:20.468\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, let's just go through and\n\n391\n00:25:20.468 --> 00:25:25.360\ndo the whitehouse.gov site.\n\n392\n00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.440\nOkay, so remember yesterday\nwhen we did ID Serve and\n\n393\n00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.570\nwe looked at some of our other stuff,\nit wasn't conclusive.\n\n394\n00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.890\nID servers saying it's whitehouse.gov.\n\n395\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.420\nThe server is whitehouse.\n\n396\n00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:44.390\nYeah right, it's not that and\nNetcraft was giving us mixed results.\n\n397\n00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:50.490\nSo here's just another way of,\nit's actually passively scanning\n\n398\n00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:55.290\nstuff because we're not aggressively\ndoing anything here for any of this.\n\n399\n00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:59.020\nWe are just turning on, it's listening,\nand we're browsing to there.\n\n400\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.420\nThat's a normal thing, so all we have to\ndo is open up a browser and go to that and\n\n401\n00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.780\nhit enter on it, and so\nit just goes through and says okay,\n\n402\n00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.820\nthere's the White House's website,\nooh how exciting.\n\n403\n00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:16.300\nSo if I go over to P0F to see what it got,\n\n404\n00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.160\nwell it's giving me stuff.\n\n405\n00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.580\nIt's displayed quite a bit, so\n\n406\n00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:27.260\nlet me scroll up to see if I've got\nanything that, more towards the top,\n\n407\n00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:31.730\nthat is giving me anything\nthat I can work on.\n\n408\n00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:36.986\nWhoops, it looked like it's\nstill loading stuff there.\n\n409\n00:26:36.986 --> 00:26:39.045\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n410\n00:26:39.045 --> 00:26:41.970\n>> But I saw it right there.\n\n411\n00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.160\nI mean I scrolled right past it.\n\n412\n00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.358\nI'm gonna do control c so\nit doesn't keep collecting stuff there.\n\n413\n00:26:48.358 --> 00:26:52.693\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you saw it right here, so\n\n414\n00:26:52.693 --> 00:26:56.780\nthere's something going out and\n\n415\n00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.980\nlet's go underneath it,\ndo we see anything?\n\n416\n00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.660\nNot seeing anything yet on there, but\n\n417\n00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.320\nif I keep going through,\nyeah there's some stuff.\n\n418\n00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.410\nIt looks like I had rack space on there,\nand if I keep poking through this,\n\n419\n00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.010\nI saw one of these as I went through.\n\n420\n00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:25.480\nI did see some Linux stuff that\nindicated that's what it would be.\n\n421\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.390\nIn fact, when you start getting\ndown to here, the raw signature,\n\n422\n00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.980\nyou can see that it's setting cookies and\nstuff like that.\n\n423\n00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:38.560\nBut it was in there as I keep\ngoing through, I can see what\n\n424\n00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.480\nthe host actually is and start learning\nabout services and stuff like that.\n\n425\n00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.740\nThat would be something\nthat acts as an entry point\n\n426\n00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.600\nbecause I've got something that's\ngiving me a good amount of information.\n\n427\n00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.805\nThis thing just happens to be telling me\nits life story, almost, at this point.\n\n428\n00:27:51.805 --> 00:27:53.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I dug through it enough or\n\n429\n00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.430\nI happen to dump this out to a text file.\n\n430\n00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.330\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I could go through and\n\n431\n00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.772\nsearch it and find stuff real easily.\n\n432\n00:28:01.772 --> 00:28:06.820\nIn fact, looking at this,\nthis is talk about something we had in our\n\n433\n00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.730\nprevious episodes, talking about\nif somebody uses the cloud and\n\n434\n00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.910\nall these different hosting technologies.\n\n435\n00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:16.640\nIf you look really closely at that,\n\n436\n00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.990\nyou have something that's\na dead give away right here.\n\n437\n00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.382\nWhat that says right there,\nif you can't read it,\n\n438\n00:28:23.382 --> 00:28:28.250\nsays https://mycloud.rackspace.com.\n\n439\n00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:32.960\nI bet if I went to there, yeah, they're\nusing rackspace.com to host their stuff,\n\n440\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.840\nbut they are using a cloud solution,\n\n441\n00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.680\nwhich wouldn't really surprise me for\nconsidering the type of stuff\n\n442\n00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:45.630\nthat the White House gets to\nthat website all the time.\n\n443\n00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:49.712\nYou know there's a lot of complaints,\nno I'm kidding.\n\n444\n00:28:49.712 --> 00:28:50.760\n>> [LAUGH] Not in the White House.\n\n445\n00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.270\n>> Never.\n\n446\n00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.400\nLet me talk to your manager.\n\n447\n00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:58.330\n[LAUGH] So yeah,\nyou're seeing right on there you're seeing\n\n448\n00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:02.540\nthat there's a lot of good stuff just\ncoming through from a quick scan.\n\n449\n00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.590\nSo that's just kinda to open\nyour eyes just a bit on that,\n\n450\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:12.170\nand that's just a couple tools that\nwe had seen in our past explorations.\n\n451\n00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:16.920\nNow we're seeing if we send a packet\nout to something, if we did a sweep of\n\n452\n00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:22.290\na range of IPs to see which ones are alive\nand then targeted those ones specifically,\n\n453\n00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:25.610\nwe could start learning about them and\nthen see, hey do I have an entry point.\n\n454\n00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.980\nThen that might be the time under\nthe right conditions to break out some\n\n455\n00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:30.730\nheavy hitters.\n\n456\n00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:35.720\nMaybe Metasploit is gonna open\nup the guns with that and\n\n457\n00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.244\nstart planting stuff on systems or\n\n458\n00:29:38.244 --> 00:29:41.580\nmaybe you're gonna find something else\nthat might be interesting to you.\n\n459\n00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:46.725\nFinding these hosts and\nbeing able to discover them, and\n\n460\n00:29:46.725 --> 00:29:52.170\nkind of just walk around, can get you\na long way towards really getting in.\n\n461\n00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.810\nYou gotta pay attention to what hosts\nare being on there and if they're secured.\n\n462\n00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:00.510\nI'm not saying stuff I found here\nmeans that either Nintendo's website,\n\n463\n00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.220\nor the White House website is insecure.\n\n464\n00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.780\nI'm just showing that the information,\nthat's a way to gain information.\n\n465\n00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.410\nYou would just apply it out\nwhen you're doing pen tests or\n\n466\n00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:12.312\nsomething against a target and\nsee what you could find.\n\n467\n00:30:12.312 --> 00:30:15.970\nRemember when we did pen testing we\nfound out how to get a range of IP's and\n\n468\n00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:17.880\nsub it in pretty quickly.\n\n469\n00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.410\nWe can really just narrow it down\nto something and sweep across that.\n\n470\n00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:25.808\nYou always want to pay attention to what\nhosts you have and who you exposed them to\n\n471\n00:30:25.808 --> 00:30:29.410\nbecause you never know if they're gonna do\nsomething like what we just showed here,\n\n472\n00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:30.140\nor other stuff.\n\n473\n00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.650\n>> Or other stuff, and\nthat's the part that scares me.\n\n474\n00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.560\n[LAUGH] Well, ladies and gentleman,\nthat looks like that does it for time for\n\n475\n00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.800\nthis particular episode, so\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n476\n00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.870\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n477\n00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:42.190\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n478\n00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:46.890\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.470\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, with me today\nis Sean Oriyano, how you doing Sean?\n\n4\n00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.234\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n5\n00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:20.220\n>> I can not complain,\n\n6\n00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.111\nwe're doing another episode of our\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner.\n\n7\n00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:27.433\nAnd in this episode Sean,\nwe're gonna focus in on firewalls and\n\n8\n00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:29.103\ngood old access control lists.\n\n9\n00:00:29.103 --> 00:00:31.355\n>> Yep, that's what we have.\n\n10\n00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:36.098\n>> [LAUGH] So firewalls, I mean we,\nat this point in our careers, studying for\n\n11\n00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:39.807\nour exams, we should be familiar\nwith what a firewall is.\n\n12\n00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:42.895\nIt's a device that will\nblock all those ports.\n\n13\n00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:46.450\nWe have 65,535 of those guys.\n\n14\n00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.500\nFirewalls go in and\nblock all those ports and\n\n15\n00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.280\nthen we get to open up which ports we\nwanna allow to come through, right?\n\n16\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.210\n>> Yeah, absolutely, they're just\na mechanism that regulates the, or\n\n17\n00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.190\ncontrols the flow of\ntraffic between two zones,\n\n18\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.920\nas I like to call it,\nthat they aren't trusted the same way.\n\n19\n00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.510\nOne's got a higher or lower security level\nthan the other so you have to control\n\n20\n00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.490\nthe communication between the two,\nhence the need for a firewall.\n\n21\n00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.469\nAnd as you should already know,\nif not, just quickly,\n\n22\n00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:23.055\nis that there's several different\ngenerations of firewalls.\n\n23\n00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:27.955\nEverything from the basic packet\nfiltering stuff that just looks at where\n\n24\n00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:32.776\nit's coming from, where it's going to,\nimportant protocol, that,\n\n25\n00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:36.987\nall the way up to the application\nlayer and all that good stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:41.723\nAnd there's different things\nhappen at each one of the levels.\n\n27\n00:01:41.723 --> 00:01:46.767\nAnd they all offer you something\nthat the other one doesn't,\n\n28\n00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:51.522\nor they add to something that\nthe other ones already have.\n\n29\n00:01:51.522 --> 00:01:57.670\nSo that's what a firewall is,\nnot a new device or a new concept.\n\n30\n00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.400\nIt's something that has been around for\na while.\n\n31\n00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.680\nWe have, in addition to\ndifferent types of firewalls,\n\n32\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.720\nwe have them implemented\nin many different ways.\n\n33\n00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.410\nWe have firewalls are implemented\nas a hardware device,\n\n34\n00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.925\nones are implemented as software, some\nthat are implemented as custom software.\n\n35\n00:02:14.925 --> 00:02:19.405\nI mean there's examples of Linux distros\nthat are out there that have been stripped\n\n36\n00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:22.805\ndown and reworked,\nthat all they do is act as a firewall.\n\n37\n00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:27.353\nYou can't put applications, all that stuff\non there, that's all they're meant to do.\n\n38\n00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:33.065\nAnd so they've just taken it down\ndifferent paths with how they're made.\n\n39\n00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:38.854\nAnd then beyond that we have firewalls\nat work at the enterprise level,\n\n40\n00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:42.240\nwhich is more where we're talking here.\n\n41\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.910\nFor the stuff we're going through with\nthe CASP is those types of devices like\n\n42\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.170\nthe Cisco stuff, and the whole\ncheckpoint stuff, and all those things.\n\n43\n00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.165\nWe're talking stuff at that level,\nbut there are host-based ones or\n\n44\n00:02:57.165 --> 00:03:03.359\npersonal ones, sometimes call them too,\nthat just reside in the individual system.\n\n45\n00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.310\nAnd those are quite common.\n\n46\n00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.114\nEither people will download them onto\ntheir system and use it as-is, or\n\n47\n00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:12.590\nthey will already be present.\n\n48\n00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.522\nIn the case of Windows, we've had at\nleast something that was either called or\n\n49\n00:03:17.522 --> 00:03:19.701\nqualified as a firewall since XP.\n\n50\n00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:22.413\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Those that have been around that long\n\n51\n00:03:22.413 --> 00:03:23.138\nknow what I mean.\n\n52\n00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:28.260\nSo they've had it in there for a while.\n\n53\n00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.293\nAnd you can also for, like I said, any\nof these operating systems you have out\n\n54\n00:03:32.293 --> 00:03:34.731\nthere, you can download a firewall for\nthem.\n\n55\n00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:39.331\nAnd that includes even the stuff\non your mobile phones and tablets,\n\n56\n00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:41.116\nthey do exist even there.\n\n57\n00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:45.098\nSo you can go all the way down and\nget them there if you want,\n\n58\n00:03:45.098 --> 00:03:47.700\nwhich isn't necessarily a bad idea,\n\n59\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.680\nconsidering the types of stuff that\nare being done with mobile devices.\n\n60\n00:03:53.905 --> 00:03:56.618\nBut that's the different forms\nthat a firewall can take.\n\n61\n00:03:56.618 --> 00:04:00.595\n>> Nice, all right, so I guess one of the\nbiggest things we gotta do is figure out\n\n62\n00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:02.745\nwhere to put the firewall?\n\n63\n00:04:02.745 --> 00:04:07.822\n>> Yeah, there's some things\nthat would jump out immediately\n\n64\n00:04:07.822 --> 00:04:11.932\nas being obvious choices on where to put\na firewall when you're doing your design.\n\n65\n00:04:11.932 --> 00:04:17.162\nBut then there's some things that\nwouldn't necessarily be as obvious to\n\n66\n00:04:17.162 --> 00:04:20.782\njust someone coming into it or\nlearning this stuff for the first time.\n\n67\n00:04:20.782 --> 00:04:25.962\nFor example,\nit's kind of obvious that between\n\n68\n00:04:25.962 --> 00:04:29.122\nyour network and the great beyond and\n\n69\n00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:32.120\nall the stuff outside your control,\nthere's going to be a firewall there.\n\n70\n00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.420\nI mean that one is academic.\n\n71\n00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.970\nAs soon as you know what firewalls are and\nknow the differences between here and\n\n72\n00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.660\nthere, yeah,\nstick a firewall right in there.\n\n73\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.080\nAnd then of course we have the next level\nimplementation of that which would be\n\n74\n00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.360\noutside world, firewall,\nDMZ, another firewall,\n\n75\n00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.890\nthen everything inside that\nnetwork that's under your control.\n\n76\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.270\nThat's another variation of it.\n\n77\n00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.590\nBut it's not unheard of to have\nthem just on your internal network\n\n78\n00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.730\nto block off certain areas\nto certain types of traffic.\n\n79\n00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.150\nWhen necessary, that's done.\n\n80\n00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.745\nYou'll see them,\nsometimes they'll actually go through and,\n\n81\n00:05:10.745 --> 00:05:14.180\nin the case of Windows you can do\ngroup policy to configure firewalls.\n\n82\n00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.190\nSometimes they will use that to configure\nfirewalls on the host systems because\n\n83\n00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.140\nthey need to allow a certain type of\ntraffic that wasn't allowed before.\n\n84\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.038\nAnd so they need to manipulate those.\n\n85\n00:05:26.038 --> 00:05:28.121\nAnd then there's even firewalls and\n\n86\n00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:31.630\nthings like those wireless\nrouters that you'll get.\n\n87\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.830\nThat's a very common one for\nthe consumer grade area.\n\n88\n00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.671\nAnd then you even see them\nembedded inside of other devices,\n\n89\n00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.950\nwhich may just be an afterthought.\n\n90\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.070\nBut, I would say if you wanna\nboil away all this confusion and\n\n91\n00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.581\ndecide if you've got\na situation where you need, or\n\n92\n00:05:49.581 --> 00:05:54.260\nmight need to have a firewall,\nis look at the situation and\n\n93\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.548\nsee if you have a change in\nsecurity context between the two.\n\n94\n00:05:57.548 --> 00:05:59.630\nIf there is dropping of security or\n\n95\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.830\nincrease in the level of\nsecurity between two points.\n\n96\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.950\nIf that's the case,\nthen you may be looking at,\n\n97\n00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.730\nif this is low security over here and\nhigher security over here,\n\n98\n00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.080\nthere's gonna probably be a firewall or\nsomething here\n\n99\n00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.620\nto make sure that stuff doesn't flow\nback and forth just however it sees fit.\n\n100\n00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.310\nThat there's only certain things\nthat go one way, or the other.\n\n101\n00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.380\nSo that's kind of\nthe simple rule of thumb.\n\n102\n00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.548\nBut there are plenty of implementations.\n\n103\n00:06:29.548 --> 00:06:33.332\nHeck, some people might say just\ninternally on your network, you've\n\n104\n00:06:33.332 --> 00:06:38.250\nalready got a firewall wrapped around your\nnetwork between you and the outside world.\n\n105\n00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.415\nIf you've got a change in\nsecurity between two points,\n\n106\n00:06:40.415 --> 00:06:44.720\nthey might just say,\nI'm going to throw a router in there and\n\n107\n00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.295\njust use that to block some traffic and\njust call it even.\n\n108\n00:06:48.295 --> 00:06:49.555\nAnd which you could do,\n\n109\n00:06:49.555 --> 00:06:53.925\nyou could set up ACLs on the router\nto control the flow of traffic.\n\n110\n00:06:53.925 --> 00:06:58.025\nSo these rules would say, well,\nthese things just aren't allowed to go or\n\n111\n00:06:58.025 --> 00:07:00.020\nthey can't touch these hosts in here.\n\n112\n00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.580\nYou could definitely do that if\nthat's more your cup of tea.\n\n113\n00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.420\nThere's different opinions\non this to be sure,\n\n114\n00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:14.270\npeople will put a router in place\nwhere others will put a firewall.\n\n115\n00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.970\nSome people might actually put, instead\nof doing a double firewall situation,\n\n116\n00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.340\nthey might actually rip out for the DMZ.\n\n117\n00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.330\nThey might say, okay, the outer firewall,\nI'm gonna rip that out and\n\n118\n00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.579\nput a router in there, and just use that\nto create what they call a screen subnet.\n\n119\n00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:34.990\nWhere that router actually blocks\ncertain types of traffic from coming in,\n\n120\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.420\nand everything else they\nkind of assume that hey,\n\n121\n00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.060\nif it can get past it,\nit can query the stuff inside the DMZ.\n\n122\n00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.996\nBut then you have that other firewall\non the other side of that DMZ or\n\n123\n00:07:44.996 --> 00:07:49.094\nscreen subnet where stuff can't\nget through into the main network.\n\n124\n00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:55.305\nSo you've got some creativity here, but\nwhich one you use, a router with its ACLs,\n\n125\n00:07:55.305 --> 00:08:00.117\nor firewalls with its rules and\nall the stuff that goes with that,\n\n126\n00:08:00.117 --> 00:08:04.020\nIt's kind of almost like\na personal taste thing.\n\n127\n00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:09.450\nI tend to the stuff nowadays,\nI tend to lean more towards if I\n\n128\n00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:15.280\nhave a chance of security contacts, I lean\nmore towards the firewall than the router.\n\n129\n00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.350\nA router I use if maybe I had\na DMZ bordered by two firewalls,\n\n130\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.890\nI might put a router in front of the outer\none, just so it blocks some traffic that I\n\n131\n00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.990\nknow I don't even want\nthe firewall to be bothered with.\n\n132\n00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.050\nI know it shouldn't be in here,\nor even be evaluated, so\n\n133\n00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.400\nI'm just gonna block it at the router\ncuz it can do it a lot easier.\n\n134\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.880\nAnd then I'll let other traffic\npass through to be evaluated but\n\n135\n00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.000\nthat's just one of\nthe things that I might do.\n\n136\n00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.060\nYou might look at me and\ngo I would never do it that way.\n\n137\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.500\nI'm not gonna tell you you're stupid or\ndoing it the wrong way.\n\n138\n00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.340\nIt's just that's the way\nyou've chosen to do it.\n\n139\n00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.174\n>> The different we can set them up,\ndifferent places we can put them depending\n\n140\n00:08:53.174 --> 00:08:55.440\non what we're trying to\ndo with that device.\n\n141\n00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.310\n>> Yeah, and that's true, and really it's\ntrue with any of these types of devices.\n\n142\n00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.840\nYeah, you got firewalls, you got routers.\n\n143\n00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.045\nI could sit here, and we are going to\ntalk about IDS's and IPS's and here.\n\n144\n00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:10.947\nIt's the exact same discussion with those\nis that you can get many different answers\n\n145\n00:09:10.947 --> 00:09:12.685\non where you want to put them.\n\n146\n00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:16.059\nSome people will place those\nin very specific places and\n\n147\n00:09:16.059 --> 00:09:19.810\nother people will just liberally\nput them all over the place.\n\n148\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.070\nBut we'll get to that\ndiscussion in due time so\n\n149\n00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.320\nwe won't have that now and\nwear it out and ruin the surprise.\n\n150\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.150\nSo how do we, you know if we put\na firewall in place, how do we know if\n\n151\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:36.200\nit's setup properly or what do we\nneed to do to secure this device?\n\n152\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.150\n>> Well as far as a firewall goes, I mean\nyou were mentioning on it that, when you\n\n153\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:46.860\nget a firewall, what you do is, they are\nusually always locked all the way down.\n\n154\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.570\nWe see the heavy duty ones\nare all locked down, and so\n\n155\n00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.410\nnothing's getting through,\nit's designed to be that way.\n\n156\n00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:01.570\nAnd then you create the steps you need\nto actually allow what you want to pass.\n\n157\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:06.630\nAnd so you go from having just\na bulletproof, in essence\n\n158\n00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:11.530\nbarrier to adding the levels of security\nyou feel are appropriate on there.\n\n159\n00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:17.280\nSo what those rules will look like and\nwhat the configuration looks\n\n160\n00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.495\nlike is gonna depend on you knowing\nwhat applications your supporting.\n\n161\n00:10:22.495 --> 00:10:25.495\nIf you're gonna have\na DMZ would be in there.\n\n162\n00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:30.185\nWhat types of traffic should\nbe getting to your network.\n\n163\n00:10:30.185 --> 00:10:32.388\nWhat types of activity should\nbe going off your network.\n\n164\n00:10:32.388 --> 00:10:34.591\nI mean,\nthose things should all be determined and\n\n165\n00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:38.052\nI'd even go as far as to say if people are\nlooking at this and planing this out and\n\n166\n00:10:38.052 --> 00:10:41.199\nthen they know those things on their\nnetwork and have a good knowledge of\n\n167\n00:10:41.199 --> 00:10:44.416\nit which they should, is that you have\na good knowledge of these things.\n\n168\n00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:49.012\nIt should be as easy for you to get\neven Excel spreadsheet out line by line\n\n169\n00:10:49.012 --> 00:10:53.149\nthe rules you need and\ndetermine the order like you were saying,\n\n170\n00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:56.795\nfrom most specific to least specific,\nor way.\n\n171\n00:10:56.795 --> 00:10:58.435\nOther way around, yeah.\n\n172\n00:10:58.435 --> 00:11:00.752\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't change.\n\n173\n00:11:00.752 --> 00:11:01.518\nSo.\n\n174\n00:11:01.518 --> 00:11:04.687\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you'll get that, you can get that,\n\n175\n00:11:04.687 --> 00:11:08.724\nyou can lay it out in a spreadsheet and\nonce you've got that out and\n\n176\n00:11:08.724 --> 00:11:13.620\nyou can visualize it and see what you\nneed then you just have to go about.\n\n177\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.460\nFigure out how to get\nthat into your firewall.\n\n178\n00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.230\nYou know, however that may be,\nwhatever firewall you have.\n\n179\n00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:23.350\nYou know, so know what's on your network,\nknow what applications you're supporting,\n\n180\n00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.260\nwhat traffic needs to flow and\nwhat doesn't need to flow.\n\n181\n00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.870\nAnd, then, just start once you've got\nthat visualized you can start creating\n\n182\n00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.237\nthe rules off of it.\n\n183\n00:11:32.237 --> 00:11:39.480\nThen comes the actual real test,\nwhich is does it work?\n\n184\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.460\nFirst I, trust me, whoever says they're\ngetting firewalls the first time,\n\n185\n00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.590\nsays they got it right the first try and\n\n186\n00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.290\neverything passed and\nworked the way they wanted it to is lying.\n\n187\n00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:53.950\n[LAUGH] That's just my philosophy, so not\nalways but that's the way I feel about it.\n\n188\n00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.750\nI kind of feel that it was really\nsimple and they got real lucky.\n\n189\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.790\nWho knows.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n190\n00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.780\n>> I'm sure it happens on the first try\n\n191\n00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.750\nbut they can be kind of nasty.\n\n192\n00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:01.930\n>> Yeah.\n>> When you get in\n\n193\n00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.030\nto it at the first time.\n\n194\n00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.450\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> That's how you learn.\n\n195\n00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.095\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n196\n00:12:06.095 --> 00:12:08.525\nOr somebody makes it through your\nfirewall and that's how you learn.\n\n197\n00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:09.730\n>> Yeah, you learn it that way too.\n\n198\n00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:10.955\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Either way, you learn.\n\n199\n00:12:10.955 --> 00:12:11.935\nThat's the good thing.\n\n200\n00:12:11.935 --> 00:12:12.545\n>> Right.\n>> All right.\n\n201\n00:12:12.545 --> 00:12:14.665\nSo what else do we need\nto talk about then?\n\n202\n00:12:14.665 --> 00:12:17.535\nWe talked about different types\nof firewalls, where we should\n\n203\n00:12:17.535 --> 00:12:22.200\nput those in our network, what else\nyou wanna talk about with firewalls?\n\n204\n00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.595\n>> Well, the next thing with\nfirewalls comes in, it to is,\n\n205\n00:12:26.595 --> 00:12:29.250\nto make sure you set it up right is,\n\n206\n00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.218\nis really testing it to see if\nit's meeting your expectations.\n\n207\n00:12:34.218 --> 00:12:38.662\nAnd there's really a lot of\nways you can test a firewall,\n\n208\n00:12:38.662 --> 00:12:43.105\nit just depends on how aggressive\nyou want to get with it,\n\n209\n00:12:43.105 --> 00:12:49.960\nhow complete you want to be with it, and\nhow much time you have, that good stuff.\n\n210\n00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.640\nAnd fortunately, we do have\n\n211\n00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.280\nwith all these different methods we\nalso have automated tools built into it.\n\n212\n00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.460\nThat can help you really kind of\ntake a look at the firewall and\n\n213\n00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.470\nsee what's happening there and\nif stuff is getting past it.\n\n214\n00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.050\nOr, if someone can figure how,\n\n215\n00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:09.820\nif someone is able to figure out what your\nfirewall looks like from the outside.\n\n216\n00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.400\nWe have plenty techniques\nto help us out there and\n\n217\n00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.050\nto make sure the stuff is done right.\n\n218\n00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:20.890\nAnd so that's the good news, is that\nyou can test the stuff out pretty easy,\n\n219\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.760\nor pen tester can test it\nout pretty easy for you.\n\n220\n00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.900\nSo that's kind of our next step there,\nis to see what we can do we're gonna\n\n221\n00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:34.660\nlook at it mainly from the pen tester side\nis that I've got a black box situation.\n\n222\n00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.750\nI don't know what's behind the curtain.\n\n223\n00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:41.960\nAnd now I'm just launching stuff\nat the firewall to see, well,\n\n224\n00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.480\ndoes it stop the traffic,\ndoes it let it pass?\n\n225\n00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.450\nWhat happens with it?\n\n226\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.560\nSo that's where we're\nheaded at this point.\n\n227\n00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.440\n>> All right, well let's take a look and\nsee what kind of damage we can do.\n\n228\n00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.010\n>> All right, that's music to my ears.\n\n229\n00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:02.133\nAll right, so what I have got\nhere is the first thing I'm\n\n230\n00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:07.365\ngonna show is I kind of show\nyou what the results of it are,\n\n231\n00:14:07.365 --> 00:14:10.417\nis you could do packet crafting.\n\n232\n00:14:10.417 --> 00:14:14.307\nPacket crafting is basically\nlike using ping, but\n\n233\n00:14:14.307 --> 00:14:18.921\nthe difference is that instead\nof just doing what ping does,\n\n234\n00:14:18.921 --> 00:14:24.256\nwhich is where you type in the command and\nmaybe tell it how often to send\n\n235\n00:14:24.256 --> 00:14:29.670\nthe ping and adjust the size of\nthe ping and all that and where to go.\n\n236\n00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.510\nYour pack crafting's going\none step further than that.\n\n237\n00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:39.460\nYou're actually sending a packet off\nlike Ping does except you are creating\n\n238\n00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.610\nthe packet was certain\nparameter set on it.\n\n239\n00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:50.930\nNow what I've done to give you\na sense of what's happening here\n\n240\n00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:58.250\nis I have you know, I will scroll this\nup you can see them information here.\n\n241\n00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.670\nYou can see EIFH Ping3\nwhich is the pack crafter,\n\n242\n00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.903\nthey actually is an H ping 2 as well.\n\n243\n00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:07.995\nThere is also an H ping, but if you're\nusing that, that's way out of date, so\n\n244\n00:15:07.995 --> 00:15:09.735\nyou shouldn't be using that.\n\n245\n00:15:09.735 --> 00:15:13.925\nSo what you have is,\nI did H ping 3, and I did this -V.\n\n246\n00:15:13.925 --> 00:15:16.845\nNotice it's a capital V.\n\n247\n00:15:16.845 --> 00:15:24.370\nThat says verbose, and I just targeted\nanother IP address on my virtual system.\n\n248\n00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.970\nAnd it starts just going ahead just\nsaying, ping, ping, ping, ping.\n\n249\n00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.700\nNotice immediately it told me, okay,\nthere's no flags or anything set on it.\n\n250\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.910\nAnd it gave me some information and\nthen it gave me in successive lines,\n\n251\n00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:43.470\nit's actually given me you can see\nsequence numbers in there, you can see\n\n252\n00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:48.450\nother information about that packet that's\ngoing across and going back and forth.\n\n253\n00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.704\nSo you're seeing some information there.\n\n254\n00:15:52.704 --> 00:15:58.030\nSo that's very very basic but\nI really didn't do much to craft,\n\n255\n00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.310\nI didn't do anything to\ncraft a packet there at all.\n\n256\n00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.445\nI just said, start pinging this and\ngive me everything.\n\n257\n00:16:03.445 --> 00:16:05.837\nTell me everything you hear back and\nforth.\n\n258\n00:16:05.837 --> 00:16:11.077\n>> But you can actually with Hping,\n\n259\n00:16:11.077 --> 00:16:13.891\nyou can put it up.\n\n260\n00:16:13.891 --> 00:16:17.916\nIf you just bring Hping up and\n\n261\n00:16:17.916 --> 00:16:21.616\nyou do type help log desk.\n\n262\n00:16:21.616 --> 00:16:23.701\nIt's late in the day or something for me.\n\n263\n00:16:23.701 --> 00:16:26.814\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're not using that old\n\n264\n00:16:26.814 --> 00:16:27.589\nversion of Hping.\n\n265\n00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:28.956\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK].\n\n266\n00:16:28.956 --> 00:16:31.472\n>> All right.\n\n267\n00:16:31.472 --> 00:16:34.310\nSo, there we go.\n\n268\n00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:39.120\nI just went to bring up the help on here\n\n269\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.100\ninstead of me just running many\ndifferent combinations of packets.\n\n270\n00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.980\nThat would show you what it does as well.\n\n271\n00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.350\nBut I showed you what just a simple\ncommand what it looks like.\n\n272\n00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.898\nWell let's talk about the switches and\nwhich you can customize that input and\n\n273\n00:16:53.898 --> 00:16:57.300\nalso kind of point some of these out and\nwhy you might do this.\n\n274\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.800\nSo what I have here is I'm\ngoing to just looking at\n\n275\n00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.560\nthe switches that are available on this.\n\n276\n00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.040\nLet me kinda stretch that out there.\n\n277\n00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.165\nNever wants to cooperate just quite right,\nbut okay.\n\n278\n00:17:10.165 --> 00:17:10.770\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n279\n00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:14.760\n>> So\nyou can do all sorts of tweaks to this.\n\n280\n00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:22.150\nYou can really customize the packets\nthat are being sent to a remote station.\n\n281\n00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:27.600\nSo you could see in there will give\nyou an initial block of commands.\n\n282\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.820\nNotice for one thing the version, one is\na lower case v there's an uppercase and\n\n283\n00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.710\nlower case v this is\na case sensitive command.\n\n284\n00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.460\nThis one does is when you run the lower\ncase v it will tell you obviously what\n\n285\n00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.228\nversion you have.\n\n286\n00:17:40.228 --> 00:17:43.460\nWhat I wanna point out about this,\nis this something that does have.\n\n287\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:49.750\nIt does get updated and\nit does include information on new things.\n\n288\n00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.790\nSo if you update it will be able to\nfingerprint stuff more accurately and\n\n289\n00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.710\ndo different things with that.\n\n290\n00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:00.070\nBut as we go down the list and notice\none of the things you can do to actually\n\n291\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:04.960\nreally tweak out this packet.\n\n292\n00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.950\nNotice you can tell what\nprotocol it's gonna use.\n\n293\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.910\nYou can take a look at\nthat dash A command.\n\n294\n00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.390\nYou can spoof where it's coming from.\n\n295\n00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.140\nSo if you wanna see if a firewall for\n\n296\n00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.880\nexample you know what the internal\naddress range is on it.\n\n297\n00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.240\nAnd you wanna just pluck an IP\naddress out of that internal range and\n\n298\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.930\nfire it from the outside.\n\n299\n00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.800\nThat firewall shouldn't allow it to pass,\nit should just drop it and kill it.\n\n300\n00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.840\nSo and say this isn't gonna happen.\n\n301\n00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:37.460\nBut if it does you've got other\nproblems that you've gotta address.\n\n302\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.790\nBut how can you check it from this side.\n\n303\n00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.390\nSpoof one of those local addresses and\nsee what happens.\n\n304\n00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:46.800\nSee if this comes back and says,\nnope it didn't get through.\n\n305\n00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.350\nOr no it passed it will tell you that.\n\n306\n00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:55.910\nSo that's one thing we can do right\nthere to test a rule on the firewall.\n\n307\n00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.380\nBut then there's other\ntweaks as you go through.\n\n308\n00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:04.180\nAs you look at this you can tell\ndifferent flags to set on it what TCP,\n\n309\n00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.310\nUDP what size of the packet.\n\n310\n00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.620\nI mean there's a lot of\nstuff right in here.\n\n311\n00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:15.070\nYou can even tell it you see at the bottom\nof my screen there you can even see\n\n312\n00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.880\nthe dash capital E.\n\n313\n00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.620\nThat one you can even tell what\ndata to actually stick in there.\n\n314\n00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.350\nSo when it fires the stuff out so\n\n315\n00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:27.430\nit looks even more realistic than it would\nif it was just a single packet going out.\n\n316\n00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.410\nSo you can use these\ncombinations of things\n\n317\n00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:35.370\nto really test to see how the system or\nhow that firewalls gonna respond.\n\n318\n00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:40.310\nAnd you could script this too, you can\ncreate your own script with this and\n\n319\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.590\nuse it to identify stuff on firewalls\nthat might be interesting to you.\n\n320\n00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:49.940\nSo you can go through and\nrun standardize tests to see okay\n\n321\n00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:54.230\nby getting this information, I can start\ntelling what type of firewall that is.\n\n322\n00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.830\nCuz I know this is unique and\n\n323\n00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.430\nthis is unique over here,\nyou could customize something like that.\n\n324\n00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.860\nYeah so that's kind of neat.\n\n325\n00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.620\nAlso notice some of the stuff in here,\nyou can fragment packets or\n\n326\n00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.850\nswitches there fragment packets and\nthat can tell you how the firewalls gonna\n\n327\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:12.300\ndeal with those types of things or\neven IDS which we haven't gotten into.\n\n328\n00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.300\nAnd then you can even see that there\nare commands in here that can allow you to\n\n329\n00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.460\nchange sequence numbers and even adjust\nthe offsets of data going through.\n\n330\n00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.450\nSo you can create thing\nlike teardrop attacks and\n\n331\n00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:30.160\nstuff like that to watch how different\nmechanisms deal with it like firewall.\n\n332\n00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.130\nOr an IDS in that case as well.\n\n333\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.770\nSome a pretty good level\n\n334\n00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.940\nof flexibility in this command.It's\nnot the only hack crafter out there.\n\n335\n00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.940\nThis one is all done is pretty\nmuch all done in command line.\n\n336\n00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.250\nI think there are some GUIs that call\n\n337\n00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.160\non the Windows side if you\nreally wanna use that.\n\n338\n00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.990\nBut it tends to be this is one of those\ncommands that tends to be just it\n\n339\n00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.210\nseems like it's quicker just\nto use the command line.\n\n340\n00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:00.060\nJust put in the range of\nIPS put in the flags and\n\n341\n00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.380\nhit enter and just wait to see what\nthe fireworks are gonna be if anything.\n\n342\n00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.730\nSo that's it,\n\n343\n00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:10.080\nbut what we're really getting down to it\nis just that we are taking that packet and\n\n344\n00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:14.280\ninstead of just sending out\na packet you know unadulterated.\n\n345\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.360\nWe can create a packet with\nspecific parameters that we want\n\n346\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.265\nto go to that target and\nsee how that target responds.\n\n347\n00:21:21.265 --> 00:21:23.535\nSo now we're taking more control.\n\n348\n00:21:23.535 --> 00:21:25.905\nSo that's one thing you can do.\n\n349\n00:21:25.905 --> 00:21:28.825\nIt could be tedious to do\nthis on a one up basis.\n\n350\n00:21:28.825 --> 00:21:31.765\nYou're not gonna go to start\ntargeted individual ports that you\n\n351\n00:21:31.765 --> 00:21:32.925\ncan do with this.\n\n352\n00:21:32.925 --> 00:21:37.045\nYou're gonna target individual ports\ndoing that, you'd be insane to do that.\n\n353\n00:21:37.045 --> 00:21:40.310\nSo you probably wanna write\na script to do something like that.\n\n354\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.300\nThe test he is saying is out, it's for\n\n355\n00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:47.800\nus what flags are worthwhile\nusing which one's are.\n\n356\n00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:54.000\nThat depends on the particular\ntype of thing you are looking for\n\n357\n00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.580\nin some firewalls it will be\nworthwhile to set certain flags.\n\n358\n00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.190\nAnd the certain flag\nwill tell you right away,\n\n359\n00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.562\nif you run a test with it the results\ncoming back will tell you.\n\n360\n00:22:04.562 --> 00:22:06.790\nHey, this what type of firewall this is.\n\n361\n00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.108\nLike they ACT flag if you\nremember from ethical hacking and\n\n362\n00:22:10.108 --> 00:22:12.950\nsome of our other adventures of this area.\n\n363\n00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.590\nYou remember that we\nsaid that the ACT flag.\n\n364\n00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:19.870\nThe ACT flag if you set that and\nfire it out at a client and\n\n365\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:23.410\nthat client happens to be on\nthe center of a firewall.\n\n366\n00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.360\nWhether or\nnot you gonna response back to that ACT,\n\n367\n00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.400\nwill tell you if the firewall sitting\nin between is present or not.\n\n368\n00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.920\nIf it is present then you can tell it's\n\n369\n00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.444\nprobably a stable firewall because\nit will see that say there's ACT.\n\n370\n00:22:37.444 --> 00:22:41.690\nAnd there's nothing coming from this\nside for you to act in the first place.\n\n371\n00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:45.430\nSo that interaction shouldn't\nbe happening, it'll kill it.\n\n372\n00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.350\nWhereas if it goes cross you'll\nsee something like closed or\n\n373\n00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.509\nsomething coming back potentially and\nthat would tell you that.\n\n374\n00:22:51.509 --> 00:22:55.838\nYeah, it got all the way through that\nhose cuz I see the response coming back\n\n375\n00:22:55.838 --> 00:22:58.068\nwith the finger that hose all over it.\n\n376\n00:22:58.068 --> 00:23:01.740\nSo that's why would use for\nexample that one, but\n\n377\n00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.670\nyou could do other things like you know\nthese SIS and resets and stuff like that.\n\n378\n00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:10.490\nI mean recall when we did our port\nscans with end map what we did is\n\n379\n00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:14.822\nwe would go through the command line\ndo these little flag the SS and\n\n380\n00:23:14.822 --> 00:23:17.860\ndash SA and stuff like that.\n\n381\n00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.700\nSX and all that to customize it.\n\n382\n00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.340\nYou can do the same thing here.\n\n383\n00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.460\nExact same thing here if you want to.\n\n384\n00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:32.050\nAnd if NMAP wasn't available to you or it\njust wasn't practical to use or you needed\n\n385\n00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:37.250\na lot more control than NMAP could\noffer by default you might do it here.\n\n386\n00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.430\n>> And we can use this to test\nboth firewalls like network\n\n387\n00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.800\nbased firewalls as well\nas host based firewalls?\n\n388\n00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.260\n>> Yeah, any type of firewall you\ncan test with this absolutely 100%.\n\n389\n00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.725\n>> All right we've got a lot of good\ninformation there about firewalls.\n\n390\n00:23:50.725 --> 00:23:53.016\nAny closing thoughts that we\nwanna put in this episode?\n\n391\n00:23:53.016 --> 00:23:57.709\n>> Yeah let's actually show one other\nthing because I want to show that it's not\n\n392\n00:23:57.709 --> 00:23:59.018\nthe only way to do it.\n\n393\n00:23:59.018 --> 00:24:05.740\nI've got something else set up here,\ntoo, to give you another little example.\n\n394\n00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:06.300\n>> A bonus demo.\n\n395\n00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.440\nI like it.\n>> Yeah, a bonus demo.\n\n396\n00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.840\nYou guys that punched out\nearly don't get to see it.\n\n397\n00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.520\nIt's like the extra track on the CD or\nalbum.\n\n398\n00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.042\nThis one,\nI just boil down to a really simple one.\n\n399\n00:24:18.042 --> 00:24:21.550\nThis is something that\nyou can try on your own.\n\n400\n00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:25.410\nThis is one way of doing\nwhat they call firewalking.\n\n401\n00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.080\nI mentioned firewalking yesterday.\n\n402\n00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.590\nThere is a script that is in that does it\n\n403\n00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:37.570\non its own that you can run and you can\ngive it a whole string of parameters.\n\n404\n00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:42.610\nIt will give you results that are similar\nto this, maybe not the same format but\n\n405\n00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:47.938\nsomewhat similar, or what you can do here,\nis I got a script for\n\n406\n00:24:47.938 --> 00:24:53.980\nNmap called Firewalk, and\nit does the exact same type of thing.\n\n407\n00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.040\nAlso, you can add other stuff to it too\nbecause now you don't just have Firewalk,\n\n408\n00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:03.860\nas a script running, as a python script\nwhich is what Firewalk by itself is.\n\n409\n00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:08.300\nYou have Nmap and you can start chaining\nother commands onto it to help do\n\n410\n00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:13.150\nother things while it's checking\nthat firewall, which is really neat.\n\n411\n00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:17.020\nYou can sweep across the whole range,\nand do all sorts of stuff.\n\n412\n00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.105\nThis is just a very basic look at it.\n\n413\n00:25:20.105 --> 00:25:21.870\nWhat you can see is,\n\n414\n00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:26.720\nI've got the results that are right\nabout the middle of the screen.\n\n415\n00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:32.000\nI can see that it's told me,\nit's got 995 filtered ports,\n\n416\n00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.980\nit tells me what it actually\nfound that are open but\n\n417\n00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:39.970\nthen you go through and\nyou look at what the script did.\n\n418\n00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.370\nThe script says it found out that\nthere was some blocked ports there and\n\n419\n00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.700\ntold you immediately,\nthese ones are specifically blocked.\n\n420\n00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.660\nSomething's keeping these things from\ngiving me any response whatsoever.\n\n421\n00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.830\nI'm seeing that immediately.\n\n422\n00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:58.480\nThen you look at the bottom,\nit's got trace route response too.\n\n423\n00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.972\nIf you look all the way at the bottom of\nthe thing there, you can see Nmap and\n\n424\n00:26:02.972 --> 00:26:07.550\nthe dash-pn,\nwhich means don't do a ping in this case.\n\n425\n00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.750\nIt says just exclude that.\n\n426\n00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:14.870\nIf I had done that in some cases,\nit will case a scan not to hang but\n\n427\n00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:19.230\nit will cause it to sit there for a bit\nbefore it says I can't find the host.\n\n428\n00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:25.040\nThis case, I turned it off,\nI don't want a ping.\n\n429\n00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.020\nI want you to actually fire stuff\nat that and tell me what you get.\n\n430\n00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.760\nWe have that dash dash\nscript equals firewalk, so\n\n431\n00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:38.860\nit's telling Nmap to process that\nscript and do the firewalking dance,\n\n432\n00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.960\nwhatever you want to call it,\nthen it runs the tracer out command.\n\n433\n00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:49.640\nIt says also what trace route does, so\nit tells you all the hops between this.\n\n434\n00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.240\nThis doesn't look all that exciting here\nbecause this is right here on the local\n\n435\n00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.080\nnetwork going against\nanother machine here.\n\n436\n00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:02.420\nBut if you were tested against\nanother system that you own or\n\n437\n00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.450\ngoing across a network, whatever you do,\n\n438\n00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.460\nyou could see some pretty\ninteresting results off of this.\n\n439\n00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.430\nYou will see that it will tell you\nwhen you get to the firewalk section,\n\n440\n00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.620\nwhich is what we're really focusing\non here, I mean the other stuff is\n\n441\n00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.890\ngreat to have, that's why we ran those\nat the same time to do a compare.\n\n442\n00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.090\nBut if you do this firewalk,\non a normal host,\n\n443\n00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:26.540\nwhat will happen under a normal\nsituations, you'll typically see a whole\n\n444\n00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:30.130\nbunch of blocked ports and\na whole bunch of other stuff showing.\n\n445\n00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.310\nIt's saying, yeah there's stuff\nnot letting this go through or\n\n446\n00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.640\nthis is not responding in\nthe way that's normal.\n\n447\n00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.860\nIt's telling you that there's rules\nthere in place that are saying\n\n448\n00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.620\nit's dropping these or\nthere are such and such, whatever.\n\n449\n00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.650\nNow, you are in essence, by doing this,\n\n450\n00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.310\nyou are starting to reverse\nengineer the whole rule set.\n\n451\n00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:52.801\nThis firewalk script, plus Nmap and\n\n452\n00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:57.370\nother stuff that we have built in,\nif you do some explorations and\n\n453\n00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:02.390\nreally try this, you can get\nsome amazing results out of it.\n\n454\n00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.310\nYou really can.\n\n455\n00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:06.700\nYou can get a whole list\n\n456\n00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.740\nof almost exactly what the rules look like\nif you read between the lines just a bit.\n\n457\n00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.900\nYou can look at that and say, yeah,\n\n458\n00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.220\nI can see exactly the way\nthat traffic is flowing.\n\n459\n00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:20.060\nIf you've got access to the rule set,\nyou can compare the two and go wow,\n\n460\n00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:25.050\nthis is the actual road map that\nI'd use to program that firewall.\n\n461\n00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:29.820\nThis is how it looks to traffic and\nthat's how I expect traffic to react, so\n\n462\n00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.830\nI can make inferences from this traffic\nto see what that rule set looks like.\n\n463\n00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.930\nIt may not be a bad test for you to do.\n\n464\n00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:40.695\nThis is actually something I really\nwould recommend you trying out.\n\n465\n00:28:40.695 --> 00:28:47.240\nRemember, if you're gonna do this and\nhave the opportunity and permission,\n\n466\n00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.150\nof course, to do it, don't just do it from\nthe outside, do it from the inside too.\n\n467\n00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:54.850\nRemember, the rules can change\nwhether you're making ingress or\n\n468\n00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:55.910\negress to the network.\n\n469\n00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.730\nVery, very, interesting.\n\n470\n00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:02.030\nLike I said, there's also\nthe stand alone Firewalk utility,\n\n471\n00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.664\nif you don't want to use the script.\n\n472\n00:29:03.664 --> 00:29:04.320\nThe script,\n\n473\n00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.980\nif you wanna use that, you actually\nhave to grab it from the Nmap site.\n\n474\n00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.740\nHe's got a bunch of other scripts there.\n\n475\n00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.500\nFyodor, the guy that writes Nmap, actually\nhas a whole bunch of scripts up there,\n\n476\n00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.030\nso you can create your own scripts,\nor you can use some of his too.\n\n477\n00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.570\nThe scripting language is\nactually pretty robust,\n\n478\n00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:25.810\nand fairly simple to learn\nif you wanna get into it.\n\n479\n00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:26.340\n>> All right, good.\n\n480\n00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.100\nGreat ways to test our firewall,\n\n481\n00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.750\nmake sure they are doing\nwhat they're supposed to do.\n\n482\n00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.790\nLadies and gentlemen, that's gonna\ndo it for this particular episode.\n\n483\n00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:36.328\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n484\n00:29:36.328 --> 00:29:38.611\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano, and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n485\n00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:44.150\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Roderick.\n\n3\n00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.470\nWith me today is Mr.\nSean Ariano, how are you doing Sean?\n\n4\n00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.470\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n5\n00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.320\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n6\n00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.240\nWe're doing another episode in our Comp To\nYa Advanced Security Practitioner series\n\n7\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.290\nand in this one, we're going to\nbe looking at Host Hardening.\n\n8\n00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.630\nWe're going to take the hosts\nof our networks and\n\n9\n00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.730\nmake them a little bit\nmore secure all right?\n\n10\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.312\nYep, that's the name of the game\nhere you're doing a host hardening\n\n11\n00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:41.901\nis that you're trying to take it to\na installation of a given system.\n\n12\n00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:46.823\nAnd rack up the security to a level\nthat is more than it was and\n\n13\n00:00:46.823 --> 00:00:52.839\nmore in line with what you need it to\nbe at for your particular situation.\n\n14\n00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.455\nAnd it's a process that does require\nsome really really good knowledge of\n\n15\n00:00:57.455 --> 00:01:02.815\nthe systems you're dealing with, because\nyou just can't follow best practices and\n\n16\n00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:06.310\nassume that that's gonna be the end all,\ndo all.\n\n17\n00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.940\nYou have to do more than that.\n\n18\n00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.920\nYou have to know if you're\nworking with Windows.\n\n19\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.670\nYou have to be willing to go above and\nbeyond the best practices.\n\n20\n00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.840\nYou've gotta do your research.\n\n21\n00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.395\nYou've gotta know those little\nfeatures and things that the bugs,\n\n22\n00:01:20.395 --> 00:01:21.890\nthe other features.\n\n23\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.395\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That are in a product to be able to\n\n24\n00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:29.135\nfigure out, you know, what's the best\napproach to locking a system down, and\n\n25\n00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:34.970\nwhat's the balance for me between having\na system that's got a lot of features and\n\n26\n00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.650\nhaving a system that is secure.\n\n27\n00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.270\nThose things do fly kind of\ncounter to one another, so\n\n28\n00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.810\nyou really gotta figure out that balance.\n\n29\n00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.120\nAnd we can't tell you what\nthat balance is gonna be, but\n\n30\n00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.010\nwe can tell you how you\ncan use a given product or\n\n31\n00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.900\ntalk about how you get a given\nproduct to use the stuff to get there.\n\n32\n00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.930\nAnd then need to determine\nwhich ones you use.\n\n33\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.220\n>> So I guess one of the first\nthings we do is we start with our\n\n34\n00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.250\noperating system, right?\n\n35\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.470\nAnd that's got to be\na trusted operating system.\n\n36\n00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.190\n>> Yeah there's,\nthe trusted operating system\n\n37\n00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.040\nis going to be a part of the equation\nhere in certain situations,\n\n38\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.390\nwhen you say a trusted operating system,\nit's more than just saying whatever\n\n39\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.890\noperating system your using you've got\na certain comfort level that you use and\n\n40\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.280\ncertain expectations and\nyour okay with it.\n\n41\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.080\nLike some people might say I'm\ncomfortable with Windows and\n\n42\n00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.020\nother people say I'm comfortable\nwith a Mac or Linux of whatever.\n\n43\n00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.310\nIt goes beyond that when you get\nto a trusted operating system.\n\n44\n00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.840\nA trusted operating system\nis something that has been\n\n45\n00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.350\nbuilt with certain goals in mind.\n\n46\n00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.320\nIt can actually go through the\ncertification accreditation process and\n\n47\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.810\nbe tested and evaluated.\n\n48\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.710\nAnd then once that's done,\nsomeone can rubber stamp it and\n\n49\n00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.810\nput it into an environment.\n\n50\n00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.060\nSo that's what a trusted operating\nsystem will give us the ability to do.\n\n51\n00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.500\nYou know that a trusted operating system\nwill maintain A certain rating and\n\n52\n00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.820\na certain protection level on\nthe information it's processing and\n\n53\n00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.850\nstoring no matter what it's doing.\n\n54\n00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.980\nSo that's a significant thing to keep\nin mind because you want a system that\n\n55\n00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.050\nyou know if it's supposed to be processing\ndata that's a top secret, let's say.\n\n56\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.160\nIf that system fails,\nif certain things are being done with it,\n\n57\n00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.910\nyou wanna know that the data that's\nprocessing, since it's rated as\n\n58\n00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.860\na Top Secret system, it maintains that top\nsecret rating no matter what it's doing.\n\n59\n00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.950\nAnd so\nthat's an important part as an equation.\n\n60\n00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.050\nIf it can't do that,\nthen there's issues that come into\n\n61\n00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.660\nplay mainly if you add those expectations\nand meet those expectations.\n\n62\n00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.590\nYou can still choose to rubber stamp it.\n\n63\n00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.700\nThere can be someone in your\norganization that says yeah,\n\n64\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.860\nI'm gonna rubber stamp this and say yeah.\n\n65\n00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.920\nEven though it doesn't do it,\nit's approved.\n\n66\n00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.680\nBe a dumb move in most cases to do that.\n\n67\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.410\nBut you could do that.\n\n68\n00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.890\nUsually it means that if you have\nsomething that doesn't meet your specs,\n\n69\n00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:04.720\nthen what are you gonna have to do?\n\n70\n00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.430\nYou're going to find an alternative.\n\n71\n00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.710\nEspecially I'd say in a case like that,\nwhere it was supposed to be\n\n72\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.000\ntop secret rating and it's only doing\nsomething that's less than that.\n\n73\n00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.180\nNo it's just not gonna fit.\n\n74\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.360\nSo, a trusted operating\nsystem is something that\n\n75\n00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.800\nis built a certain way,\nhandles information a certain way, and\n\n76\n00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.660\nmaintains certain ratings and\nall that through its life cycle.\n\n77\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.117\n>> Okay so, how do we know if we\nhave a trusted operating system?\n\n78\n00:04:34.117 --> 00:04:37.212\n>> There's ways to\nactually accomplish that.\n\n79\n00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:43.356\nYou can set up your own certification or\nCNA program where you could say these\n\n80\n00:04:43.356 --> 00:04:49.315\nare things that you need that system\nto have and perform those tests on it.\n\n81\n00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:53.980\nAnd say okay, it meets these requirements\nand maybe it doesn't meet these.\n\n82\n00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.130\nAnd you just give your hopefully,\nyour unbiased objective report on it.\n\n83\n00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.535\nAnd then that will go to someone\nthat will do the actual process of\n\n84\n00:05:05.535 --> 00:05:11.120\nblessing that system for being used or\nsay, send it back and have it redone or.\n\n85\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.410\nIt's a proof for limited use.\n\n86\n00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.930\nThey do have options there,\nyou can get a system\n\n87\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.890\ntrusted that way because it's trusted,\nit's verified, you got confidence in it,\n\n88\n00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.990\nyour so predictable,\nyou know all those types of things.\n\n89\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.980\nHowever, you can also use\nstuff in the industry.\n\n90\n00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.270\nThere's certain programs in\nthe industry that you know,\n\n91\n00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.110\nanybody here that's kind of been\nthrough the CISP for example.\n\n92\n00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.715\nYou've maybe looked at that material or\nyou've been involved in the CNA program or\n\n93\n00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.821\nyou've worked for the government and\n\n94\n00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:45.613\nreally it could be\nthe government of any country.\n\n95\n00:05:45.613 --> 00:05:49.540\nGovernments usually have and\nmilitants usually have, and\n\n96\n00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.096\ngovernment contractors usually have,\nsome sort of CNA program that\n\n97\n00:05:54.096 --> 00:05:58.670\nthey put in place that will follow\none of the government guidelines.\n\n98\n00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.780\nAnd those have changed over the years,\nby the way.\n\n99\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.561\nThose are not the same archaic,\n\n100\n00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:09.220\nreally just rigid programs they use to\nhave, they're a lot more flexible now.\n\n101\n00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.090\nYou may remember, some of you may remember\nthey used to have something called\n\n102\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.280\nyou know ice ITSEC and\nTCSEC and the common criteria.\n\n103\n00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.480\nThey had all those ones.\n\n104\n00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.380\nThose were things that helped us\nevaluate systems to see if they\n\n105\n00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.790\nwere a trusted system,\nthey told us that they had to maintain or\n\n106\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.130\ndo certain things to earn certain ratings.\n\n107\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.820\nAnd one of them that went from\na d all the way at the bottom,\n\n108\n00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.290\nthen there was different levels\nof a c rating, then a b rating,\n\n109\n00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:44.020\nthen even an a level radion which\nhad little subsections of it and\n\n110\n00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.650\nit said if you had like an a one\nrating you did everything,\n\n111\n00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.210\nyou were secure, verified secure system.\n\n112\n00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.460\nYou did everything you were supposed to.\n\n113\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.510\nBut that system was very rigid,\n\n114\n00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.280\nyou could do things that still maintained\na really high level of security but if\n\n115\n00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.630\nyou didn't do what they specified on the\nlist, you didn't meet that rating so that\n\n116\n00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.660\nwas kind of a problem because it didn't\naccount for every possible situation.\n\n117\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.140\nNow a days the certification and\naccreditation programs\n\n118\n00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.440\nthat are out there and are constantly\nevolving, lay out a framework.\n\n119\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.080\nThey led a framework on how\nto set up the program and\n\n120\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.610\nhow to determine what risks and\nrewards you're gonna get out of it, and\n\n121\n00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.920\nhow to determine what those are and how\nto evaluate them, how to write a report.\n\n122\n00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.640\nAnd then, who's gonna be\nthe actual approving authority,\n\n123\n00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.880\nis gonna go out and\nactually sign off on it or not.\n\n124\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.920\nSo they've made it more flexible.\n\n125\n00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.675\nAnd that's constantly evolving.\n\n126\n00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:51.434\nIn fact, they just released maybe\ntwo years ago, three years ago, they\n\n127\n00:07:51.434 --> 00:07:56.273\nreleased a new version of it, to replace\nsome stuff that had been in use for\n\n128\n00:07:56.273 --> 00:08:00.252\nMany years, they replaced one\nthat added new things to it and\n\n129\n00:08:00.252 --> 00:08:03.949\nkind of discarded some of the steps and\nstreamlined it.\n\n130\n00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:05.867\nMade it so it worked better.\n\n131\n00:08:05.867 --> 00:08:07.497\nSo if you're a company,\n\n132\n00:08:07.497 --> 00:08:12.030\nyou don't have to follow those\ntypes of things as a blueprint.\n\n133\n00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.370\nI definitely would not follow the old\nrainbow series and stuff like that.\n\n134\n00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.510\nThat stuff's gonna get you in trouble.\n\n135\n00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.530\nIf you wanted to get guidance,\nyou can look at some of the stuff\n\n136\n00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.230\nthat the federal government\nhere in the US puts out.\n\n137\n00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.240\nThose are things that you can get\noff websites and you get in books.\n\n138\n00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.790\nYou can use it as a way to\nguide your program if you want.\n\n139\n00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:35.070\nOr you can just kind of go from scratch\nand figure out how you're gonna\n\n140\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.864\ndetermine the features and testing and\nhow it's gonna be approved and all that.\n\n141\n00:08:38.864 --> 00:08:42.610\nSo there's ways you can definitely\nset up your own program.\n\n142\n00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.670\nI typically recommend if you're gonna\nset up a program to evaluate systems,\n\n143\n00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.400\nthe easiest way to do it if\nyou've had no experience,\n\n144\n00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.710\njust look at what the federal\ngovernment here in the states does.\n\n145\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.208\nLike I said, there's plenty of resources\non that, white papers, everything else.\n\n146\n00:08:57.208 --> 00:09:01.160\nThere's even training classes on\nthat that tell you how to do it.\n\n147\n00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.568\nAnd you may not need to take the training\nclass, but you can get the books and\n\n148\n00:09:04.568 --> 00:09:06.750\nsay, oh, okay, that's how a program works.\n\n149\n00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.640\nAnd I can use this and\n\n150\n00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.240\nadapt it to my specific needs instead\nof just making it up as I go along.\n\n151\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.830\n>> And then we've also got another one,\ntrusted computing base, and\n\n152\n00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.340\nthat's different from our\ntrusted operating system?\n\n153\n00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.790\n>> Yeah, that's the tricky one, because\nyou're using the word trust there twice.\n\n154\n00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.000\nTrusted operating system or\ntrusted system, and\n\n155\n00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.190\nthen you've got A TCB,\na trusted computing base.\n\n156\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:34.000\nA trusted computing base,\nthe tricky thing about it is, is that when\n\n157\n00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.460\nyou look at a trusted computing base,\na trusted computing base, if you have a,\n\n158\n00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.400\nwhat's called a security boundary, kind\nof like what we had when we talked about\n\n159\n00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.780\nfirewalls, that there's everything over\nhere, and there’s everything over there.\n\n160\n00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:51.830\nAnd then there’s a wall right here that\ncreates that boundary between the two.\n\n161\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.490\nA TCB basically is gonna use\nthe same type of principle.\n\n162\n00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:01.040\nExcept in this case you're gonna have,\nif you were to draw a circle on a piece\n\n163\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.960\nof paper and you had a bunch of little\npieces sitting out here that represented\n\n164\n00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.660\nthe components you were evaluating,\nyou would take all those pieces,\n\n165\n00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.290\nand anything you put inside the circle\nwould be inside trusted computing base.\n\n166\n00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.760\nAnd you would evaluate that\ntrusted computing base to see\n\n167\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.370\nwhat level of security it can maintain.\n\n168\n00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:26.210\nSo the TCB doesn't tell you specifically\nthat there's certain levels of security.\n\n169\n00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:31.500\nIt actually tells you that these\nare the things I evaluated and\n\n170\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.610\nwhen I evaluated it,\nI got this level of security.\n\n171\n00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:41.660\nIt's an important thing to keep in mind\nthat you need to have a TCB defined.\n\n172\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.390\nAnd you don't have to call it a TCB, but\nyou typically do because it's, when you're\n\n173\n00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:50.430\ntalking technology and computing systems,\nbecause it's a standardized term,\n\n174\n00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.040\npeople understand it, and\nknow it, and why change it?\n\n175\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.933\nYou're just gonna make life\ndifficult on yourself.\n\n176\n00:10:56.933 --> 00:11:03.475\nIt's important to know that if you\ndon't use TCB, you look at it this way.\n\n177\n00:11:03.475 --> 00:11:08.595\nIf I evaluated my laptop sitting right\nhere, I'd go through and I'd do some\n\n178\n00:11:08.595 --> 00:11:14.720\ntests on it and generate a nice, prettier\nlooking report and everything on it.\n\n179\n00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.310\nAnd after I've said,\nokay this is the, I've certified that\n\n180\n00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.820\nit meets these requirements, and then I\ntake the report and the laptop and hand it\n\n181\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.890\nover to Mike, if I haven't told\nMike what specifically the criteria\n\n182\n00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:36.353\nout of the test was when I ran it,\nhow the heck does he know what to test?\n\n183\n00:11:36.353 --> 00:11:38.678\nYeah, he's got some results here.\n\n184\n00:11:38.678 --> 00:11:44.280\nBut under what conditions did you actually\nmake that, did you perform that test?\n\n185\n00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.670\nHe doesn't know cuz I\nhaven't given him that.\n\n186\n00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:51.200\nI didn't define the TCB, so\nhe has no way to compare apples to apples.\n\n187\n00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.630\nSo, a TCB is an important thing.\n\n188\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.740\nIt represents, hey,\nthis is what you're evaluating.\n\n189\n00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.720\nA TCB can change.\n\n190\n00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.740\nIt doesn't always have to be the same\nthing, but if you're evaluating you\n\n191\n00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.450\nhave to use it as a way to compare\napples to apples, not some crazy thing.\n\n192\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.135\nIf you compare them differently,\nthe results just aren't going to be valid.\n\n193\n00:12:13.135 --> 00:12:17.140\n>> And so if we start with a trusted\noperating system on our trusted computing\n\n194\n00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:22.440\nbase, then there's also a software we can\nuse to help secure our endpoints as well?\n\n195\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.250\nYeah that's the next step here\nis that typically when you do a,\n\n196\n00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.300\nwhen you evaluate\na trusted operating system,\n\n197\n00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.890\nit's typically considered to be that\nsystem as shipped whatever it is.\n\n198\n00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.000\nSystem as it arrives or created,\n\n199\n00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.450\nbecause you could have created it\nin house, that's what's evaluated.\n\n200\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.690\nThen, once it's evaluated,\n\n201\n00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:49.050\nif you're talking a computing system, they\ncould actually add into the evaluation,\n\n202\n00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:53.000\nthey could add in some\nother components into it.\n\n203\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.334\nBut they may also just as well say that\nyou evaluate a piece of hardware in that\n\n204\n00:13:00.334 --> 00:13:06.300\nonce you evaluate the piece of hardware,\nand does it do what it's supposed to?\n\n205\n00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.356\nYou can also evaluate the operating\nsystem separately if you want.\n\n206\n00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:15.305\nThen you can also say when you talk about\nthis Endpoint Security Software, those\n\n207\n00:13:15.305 --> 00:13:20.197\ncan be things that are tested and verified\nby other people yet again if you want.\n\n208\n00:13:20.197 --> 00:13:24.600\nPeople can reverse engineer that if\nthey can, if that's allowed to be done.\n\n209\n00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.070\nSometimes that will not be allowed to\nbe done, because the vendor might say,\n\n210\n00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.730\nno those are trade secrets there and\nthat ain't happening.\n\n211\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.598\nBut you will typically find,\nif you have those other components,\n\n212\n00:13:35.598 --> 00:13:39.310\nyou'll find some way to see\nwhat they've been evaluated to.\n\n213\n00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.340\nAre they approved for\nuse in your environment?\n\n214\n00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.480\nSome pieces of software that you have\n\n215\n00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.985\nliving out there may not be\nbecause of its place of origin.\n\n216\n00:13:49.985 --> 00:13:52.650\nOr who was involved in its development.\n\n217\n00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.800\nIt may not be something that's\nallowed anywhere near your systems.\n\n218\n00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.920\nYou might be able to use that at home or\nsomething if you want, but\n\n219\n00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:03.140\nyou definitely can't use it on a work\nsystem in a secure environment.\n\n220\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.540\nAnd places try to avoid that.\n\n221\n00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:11.312\nBut the stuff we're talking about for\nEndpoint Security Software,\n\n222\n00:14:11.312 --> 00:14:13.226\nI'm talking about endpoints.\n\n223\n00:14:13.226 --> 00:14:16.467\nWe're talking about\nthe different things involved,\n\n224\n00:14:16.467 --> 00:14:19.940\nlike a conversation between systems,\nreally.\n\n225\n00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.450\nWhen most people say endpoints,\nthey're probably referring to the client.\n\n226\n00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.937\nIt doesn't have to be the client,\nbut they probably are.\n\n227\n00:14:25.937 --> 00:14:30.261\nAnd software you can put in place to\nsecure the client is really all the usual\n\n228\n00:14:30.261 --> 00:14:30.955\nsuspects.\n\n229\n00:14:30.955 --> 00:14:35.534\nAnti-viruses, anti-malware, firewalls.\n\n230\n00:14:35.534 --> 00:14:37.777\nAnd then you can just\nkeep building on that.\n\n231\n00:14:37.777 --> 00:14:42.316\nAnd I even put on here, what place do you\nknow would be safe without a spam filter?\n\n232\n00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:44.426\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, right?\n\n233\n00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:48.620\n>> [LAUGH] I don't know too\nmany would be happy about that.\n\n234\n00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.680\nYou could keep adding to this list.\n\n235\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.887\nYou really could go on and on and\non and on and on with stuff to say,\n\n236\n00:14:56.887 --> 00:15:01.710\nthis is what you want to have\nin place to enhance security and\n\n237\n00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:07.025\nbring it up to a level where it's\nreally exceeds what you expect.\n\n238\n00:15:07.025 --> 00:15:09.924\nAnd just to kind of throw\nit into this discussion,\n\n239\n00:15:09.924 --> 00:15:13.524\nsince there's been a lot of\nthings thrown around it already.\n\n240\n00:15:13.524 --> 00:15:17.517\nWhen you are installing this\nEndpoint Security Software, and\n\n241\n00:15:17.517 --> 00:15:20.907\ndoing the evaluating a TCB,\nand having trusted OSs,\n\n242\n00:15:20.907 --> 00:15:25.804\nwhen you're doing all this and putting\nthis whole solution together, one of\n\n243\n00:15:25.804 --> 00:15:31.200\nthe things you're trying to do is make\nsure you stay above a certain baseline.\n\n244\n00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.250\nA baseline is important.\n\n245\n00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.777\nI can sit here and\nevaluate systems all day and tell you,\n\n246\n00:15:37.777 --> 00:15:42.701\nhey this has got this rate,\nthis does that, this does this.\n\n247\n00:15:42.701 --> 00:15:48.044\nThat means absolutely squat if I\ndon't set a minimal requirement,\n\n248\n00:15:48.044 --> 00:15:53.776\nor expect a requirement for a certain\nclass of system in an environment.\n\n249\n00:15:53.776 --> 00:15:57.351\nI say having a baseline is kind of\nlike When you go to Disney Land and\n\n250\n00:15:57.351 --> 00:16:00.278\nthey have thing saying you\ngotta be this high to ride.\n\n251\n00:16:00.278 --> 00:16:02.310\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n252\n00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.870\n>> That's kind of it.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.420\n>> So that's kind of the same idea except\n\n254\n00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.720\nfor networks and computing systems.\n\n255\n00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.280\nYou gotta meet this minimum requirement,\nif you're below that\n\n256\n00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.700\nthen well there's gotta be some\nsort of mediation that happens.\n\n257\n00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.760\nOr it's gotta be chucked and\ngotten rid of.\n\n258\n00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.700\nOr, in some cases, they would, that system\nor environment could be signed off on,\n\n259\n00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.620\nand granted an exclusion.\n\n260\n00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:29.210\nCuz let's face it, there are some systems\nout there that we call legacy systems\n\n261\n00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:34.220\nthat quite frankly, they are needed, but\nthere is no way that they're ever going to\n\n262\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:40.360\nbe brought to something that is anywhere\nclose to approaching modern standards.\n\n263\n00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.200\nI have had people ask me.\n\n264\n00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.780\nHow do you secure DOS systems?\n\n265\n00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.140\nI think I mentioned that here before.\n\n266\n00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.230\nIt's like, how do I secure a DOS system,\nlike, it's DOS, that's how you secure it.\n\n267\n00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.150\nWhat else do you want me to do?\n\n268\n00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.290\nThere's nothing else I can really do.\n\n269\n00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:59.120\nDon't let people touch it,\nso that's about it.\n\n270\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:04.690\nSo if you run into one of\nthese environments that has\n\n271\n00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:09.890\na DOS system in there,\nresiding out there, that DOS system\n\n272\n00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.690\nmay be running something that there's no\nalternative to, you can't be ported over.\n\n273\n00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.330\nYou can't virtualize it.\n\n274\n00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:16.960\nYou're stuck.\n\n275\n00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.655\nThat's what you gonna have until you can\nrip out the whole thing end to end and\n\n276\n00:17:21.655 --> 00:17:27.055\nredo it and if that's the case,\nand you can't just afford\n\n277\n00:17:27.055 --> 00:17:30.775\nto redevelop something, rip everything\nout and replace with modern stuff.\n\n278\n00:17:30.775 --> 00:17:37.915\nThey're gonna grant an exemption to that,\nand that happens all the time.\n\n279\n00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:42.240\nI think, believe it or not,\nthere's a lot of satellite systems and\n\n280\n00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.750\nstuff like that,\nstuff that was launched years ago that\n\n281\n00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.650\nhave DOS as part of their\nground systems in there.\n\n282\n00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:49.670\nYou know, GPS systems.\n\n283\n00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.760\n>> That's why we need to bring\nthe birds down and re-program them and\n\n284\n00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.670\nsent them back up.\n\n285\n00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.290\n>> Yeah.\n\n286\n00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.460\nThey can't do that anymore.\n\n287\n00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.930\nThey- some of the systems\nthat are up today,\n\n288\n00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:04.640\nthe systems that interact with them\non the ground use a DOS platforms.\n\n289\n00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.888\nYou know, they, when were they designed?\n\n290\n00:18:06.888 --> 00:18:09.120\ncome on [LAUGH] it's like\nthey been around for a while,\n\n291\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.600\nthey didn't have you know\nWindows around at the time.\n\n292\n00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.780\nSo at least not what it looks like now so\nthey went with something like DOS.\n\n293\n00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:21.315\nThey're not gonna rip out a whole bunch\nof GPS satellites and rebuild everything,\n\n294\n00:18:21.315 --> 00:18:23.409\nthat would be we've, not feasible.\n\n295\n00:18:23.409 --> 00:18:25.150\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n296\n00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.710\nSo we got our trusted operating system,\nwe got our trusted computer base,\n\n297\n00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.520\nour computing base, and then we gotta make\nsure that we're baselining our system,\n\n298\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.911\nright, running at least certain sets of\nendpoint security software on there like\n\n299\n00:18:36.911 --> 00:18:41.170\nanti-malware, anti-spyware and\nall of that.\n\n300\n00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.670\n>> Yeah you're going to have these\nthings present in your environment.\n\n301\n00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:48.200\nAnd that's not meant to be\nanywhere near an exhaustive list,\n\n302\n00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.420\nit's just bring it to your attention that\nthere are additional things you can do.\n\n303\n00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:57.370\nAnd that's not the end of it, there is\nadditional hardening that you can do.\n\n304\n00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.790\nTo really tweak the system to bring\nit up to even a higher level, and\n\n305\n00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.850\nthat's something that\nwe're gonna get into.\n\n306\n00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.200\nBut there's other things that you can\nreally do to enhance it even more, and\n\n307\n00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.400\nmore and, more as you go through.\n\n308\n00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.480\nYou've just gotta decide how\nmuch time you wanna spend.\n\n309\n00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.610\nIs it worth it?\n\n310\n00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.940\nIs there really a lot of\nreward by doing that, or\n\n311\n00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.040\nare you just doing it because\nyou got nothing better to do?\n\n312\n00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.788\nWho knows?\n\n313\n00:19:18.788 --> 00:19:19.762\n[LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n314\n00:19:19.762 --> 00:19:22.840\nyou've got to sign up to work\ndoing some of these things.\n\n315\n00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.730\n>> Very good.\nAll right.\n\n316\n00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.860\nA lot of great information.\n\n317\n00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.410\nTrying to think of what else we\nneed to talk about here, Sean,\n\n318\n00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.660\nwith our in point security software.\n\n319\n00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.295\nAnything else you can think to throw in?\n\n320\n00:19:33.295 --> 00:19:36.795\nI think we kind of got\nthe point across with that.\n\n321\n00:19:36.795 --> 00:19:43.695\nAs long as everyone understands it's\ncool with what a trusted OS is.\n\n322\n00:19:43.695 --> 00:19:49.552\nAnd kind of, we gave you some insights CNA\nprocess and definitely know what a TCB is,\n\n323\n00:19:49.552 --> 00:19:52.682\nthat's I don't believe other\npeople have a problem with that.\n\n324\n00:19:52.682 --> 00:19:56.542\nAnd remember TCB does not\nimply a security rating.\n\n325\n00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:59.362\nIt's something that you use to evaluate a,\n\n326\n00:19:59.362 --> 00:20:01.902\na secure [INAUDIBLE]\ncertain security level.\n\n327\n00:20:01.902 --> 00:20:05.402\nSo just because you trust or\nyou trust base that means hey,\n\n328\n00:20:05.402 --> 00:20:08.200\nthis thing is crap as far\nas security is concerned.\n\n329\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.120\nAnd then the same, and then there can be\na trust computing base that evaluates,\n\n330\n00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.420\nthis is super duper awesome.\n\n331\n00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.650\nYou know, they're both considered\ntrusted computing bases,\n\n332\n00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.810\nbut one's evaluated on the very low end of\nthe scale, the other one's way up there.\n\n333\n00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.260\nSo remember, it doesn't imply a certain\nsecurity rating it just says,\n\n334\n00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.950\nthis is what went into the pot to, and\n\n335\n00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:31.750\nwas stirred around to actually\ngive us the actual rating.\n\n336\n00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.430\n>> All right well a lot of\ngreat information there.\n\n337\n00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:37.980\nAgain, first step in hardening your\nhost or your node is to make sure we've\n\n338\n00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.950\ngot these things in place,

00:00:17.510\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nwith me today is Mr. Shawn Ariano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.660\nHow are you doing Shawn?\n\n5\n00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.681\n>> Doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:21.020\nHow are you doing?\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.891\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:25.373\nWe're doing another episode in our CompTIA\nAdvanced Security Practitioners Series.\n\n9\n00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:28.382\nAnd in particular in this one,\nwe are going to continue our look at host\n\n10\n00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:31.190\nhardening, we took a brief look\nat that in our previous episode.\n\n11\n00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.896\nNow we're gonna continue that theme, and\n\n12\n00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:38.643\nsee how we can help secure these\nendpoints, or these nodes on our network.\n\n13\n00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:40.907\n>> Yeah, that's the name of the game now.\n\n14\n00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:46.376\nIt's just that we went through and talked\nabout what goes into evaluating a system,\n\n15\n00:00:46.376 --> 00:00:50.350\nand how you get there,\nother things you might include.\n\n16\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.250\nBut now comes the time where we move\non to things that we can start doing\n\n17\n00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.760\nto go beyond just receiving a system and\nsaying that's how it's gonna be.\n\n18\n00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.250\nAnd we'll assume that that's\nthe way it's just gonna stay.\n\n19\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.370\nClearly not so what can we do after we've\nconsidered what software needs to go in\n\n20\n00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.730\nand what the role is?\n\n21\n00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.500\nWell, we have to start tweaking the system\nto make it work the way we want and\n\n22\n00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.708\nmaintain the security level\nthat we want as well.\n\n23\n00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:22.014\nSo that's the process that\nwe have going on here.\n\n24\n00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:27.870\n>> I mean host hardening is one of those\nthings that we do at the very beginning.\n\n25\n00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.600\nWe've got our baselines.\n\n26\n00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.950\nWe might have different baselines for\ndifferent systems.\n\n27\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.662\nI've got a baseline of security\nsettings that I apply to my client\n\n28\n00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:35.560\noperating systems.\n\n29\n00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.704\nA baseline of security settings that I\napply to my DHCP servers for example.\n\n30\n00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:45.535\nAnd usually that can include many things,\nincluding making sure we're using\n\n31\n00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:49.660\na trusted computing base, configuring\nsettings on the machine, removing default\n\n32\n00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.430\nsettings, eliminating services, a lot of\nstuff goes into hardening these hosts.\n\n33\n00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.106\n>> Yeah, it's a very,\nvery involved process.\n\n34\n00:01:57.106 --> 00:01:58.583\nIt can be a delicate process.\n\n35\n00:01:58.583 --> 00:01:59.666\nIt's something that could be\n\n36\n00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.960\nvery time-consuming when\nyou initially set it up.\n\n37\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.190\nAnd glad you actually brought it by a\ndifferent types of systems because that's\n\n38\n00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.730\nan important part of this whole\nthing is that you don't just\n\n39\n00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.660\nharden the system and just carry it that\nright on through the whole organization.\n\n40\n00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.210\nI mean, you're gonna harden them all, yes,\nhopefully you're gonna harden them all.\n\n41\n00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.450\nBut you've gotta consider the fact\nthat when you're doing this,\n\n42\n00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.660\nit's not a one size fits all thing.\n\n43\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.610\nThere's different computers, and different\nsystems that fit different purposes.\n\n44\n00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.160\nSo you can't just apply the same guidance\nacross the board because it just won't\n\n45\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.640\nwork and second of all, not all systems\nare gonna be exactly the same anyway.\n\n46\n00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.230\nSo, heck,\n\n47\n00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.100\nif you set all of your systems on\nthe organization were running Windows 7 or\n\n48\n00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.180\n8 or 10, or you know, 9 that they lost, I\ndon't know or that they have one of those.\n\n49\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.090\nLet's say you had one of those\nacross the organization were\n\n50\n00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.570\nlucky enough to have a situation where\nthey had Windows 7 as all your clients.\n\n51\n00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.330\nAnd so, theoretically, it's all the same\nversion all the same type, well,\n\n52\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.670\nyou can lock them all down\nthe same way if you wanted to.\n\n53\n00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.870\nStill doesn't make sense because\nnot everyone is gonna be using that\n\n54\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.490\noperating system the exact same\nway to do the exact same things.\n\n55\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.050\nSo therefore, they will have to\nbe considered as in groupings\n\n56\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.290\nof a machines that are in the same\nrole and then you'll organize or\n\n57\n00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.540\nharden those the way that they need\nto perform that specific role.\n\n58\n00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.560\nSo do remember that.\n\n59\n00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.716\nThat's an important thing\nto carry through this.\n\n60\n00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:35.216\nI mean heck, we've even got\nyou know clients and servers,\n\n61\n00:03:35.216 --> 00:03:39.841\nthat's array, two roles there and\nthen there's not just one type of server.\n\n62\n00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:41.617\nThere's bunches of those and\na bunch of types of clients.\n\n63\n00:03:41.617 --> 00:03:44.901\nSo you could have a lot\nof work ahead of you, but\n\n64\n00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:48.200\nit's really tough when\nyou first get into it.\n\n65\n00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.100\nAfter that, it's just updates\nif you stay on top of it.\n\n66\n00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.760\nSo that's the good thing about it.\n\n67\n00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.710\n>> And we might have multiple baselines.\n\n68\n00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.880\nWe might have a baseline that we\napply to all Server 2012 R2 machines.\n\n69\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.050\nAnd then we got a separate baseline\nthat we apply on top of that if\n\n70\n00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.860\nit's running DNS and DHCP, for example.\n\n71\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.110\n>> Yeah, exactly, it's that,\ndepending on what's there and\n\n72\n00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.110\nwhat you expect that system to do,\n\n73\n00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.370\nthat's gonna dictate just what's gonna\nbe there and what's not gonna be there.\n\n74\n00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.620\nYou don't need to perform the same\nguidance or the same thing on all of them.\n\n75\n00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.780\nSo you're gonna definitely create\ndifferent baselines and so\n\n76\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.480\nyou have different expectations\nof what's on each one.\n\n77\n00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.220\nIf you go to a server that's just\nhosting a Web server itself and\n\n78\n00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.370\nthat's it, that's gonna be\na specific configuration there.\n\n79\n00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.810\nIt's gonna be expected.\n\n80\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.390\nBut once you start adding in a Web\napplication, that changes it.\n\n81\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.410\nIf it's a certificate server,\nthat's another one.\n\n82\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.230\nA domain controller,\ndefinitely is another one.\n\n83\n00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.590\nYou're not gonna secure that the same\nway you secure everything else,\n\n84\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.110\nthat would be a very bad move.\n\n85\n00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.700\n>> We don't make sure port 80 is\nopen on our domain controllers?\n\n86\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.222\n>> Oh, well that's fine.\n\n87\n00:04:53.222 --> 00:04:56.037\n>> [LAUGH] So yeah,\ndefinitely different baselines,\n\n88\n00:04:56.037 --> 00:04:59.703\ndifferent configurations we want to apply,\nas you said earlier,\n\n89\n00:04:59.703 --> 00:05:03.512\nbased on the role that those machines\nare playing in our enterprise.\n\n90\n00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:06.694\n>> In fact,\nI encourage people to leave little ports\n\n91\n00:05:06.694 --> 00:05:09.992\nlike that open because\nthat's how I make my money.\n\n92\n00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:13.255\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All serious, though,\n\n93\n00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:17.834\n[COUGH] I shouldn't have said that,\nor we gotta edit that out.\n\n94\n00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:24.336\nSo, yeah, it's gonna be a process\nthat definitely takes some time.\n\n95\n00:05:24.336 --> 00:05:26.330\nYou have to make all these considerations.\n\n96\n00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.730\nSo, you get that out of the way and\n\n97\n00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.630\nyou've determined what needs to be there,\nwhat doesn't.\n\n98\n00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.830\nWhat you do to get to that point?\n\n99\n00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.626\nHeck, what do you do if\nyou're new to this thing and\n\n100\n00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:41.741\nyou don't know specifically what\nshould be and what shouldn't be there.\n\n101\n00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:45.916\nThat's gonna be the tough part,\nyou're thrown to the wolves,\n\n102\n00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:50.495\nthey're gonna say go take care of that and\nyou're like oh damn [LAUGH].\n\n103\n00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:52.573\nIt's like what are you gonna do?\n\n104\n00:05:52.573 --> 00:05:59.354\nFortunately why you're still gonna\nhave to step up your game and\n\n105\n00:05:59.354 --> 00:06:06.860\nstart learning what things you\nhave to do on top of other stuff.\n\n106\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.929\nThere are a lot of guidances posted\nout there that can help you out.\n\n107\n00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.930\nThere's different agencies that will\npost them out there, Microsoft for\n\n108\n00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.790\nexample posts their stuff.\n\n109\n00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.750\nSome industries will put out certain\nguidelines that they say this is a good\n\n110\n00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.050\nidea or\nbest practices that you can build on.\n\n111\n00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.560\nWhen you go here in the states,\n\n112\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.480\nthe federal government has white\npapers and PDFs they put out.\n\n113\n00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.540\nThat say this is something\nthat we found as helpful and\n\n114\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.880\nwe just wanna put it out there and\nyou can build on top of it.\n\n115\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.903\nYou could even go to the NSA\nhas some white papers out there\n\n116\n00:06:46.903 --> 00:06:52.565\nthat tell you what you can do with\nyour computer to make it safer.\n\n117\n00:06:52.565 --> 00:06:53.924\n[COUGH] Don't let the NSA on it.\n\n118\n00:06:53.924 --> 00:06:56.745\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That number one.\n\n119\n00:06:56.745 --> 00:06:58.625\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n120\n00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:00.680\n>> Oh, I'm gonna get audited this week.\n\n121\n00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.307\n>> Yes, you are.\n\n122\n00:07:01.307 --> 00:07:03.086\n[LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n123\n00:07:03.086 --> 00:07:05.610\nyeah,they've got stuff out there too.\n\n124\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:12.030\nSo there's plenty of things with the point\nbeing that with all the stuff out there,\n\n125\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.770\nyou can put together your own\nsolution off of all that and\n\n126\n00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.160\nenhance it, build on it, and\nget something that more closely\n\n127\n00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.450\nfits your environment than\nwould be in a generic sense.\n\n128\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.800\nSo, that's the cool thing if\nyou just stepped into it.\n\n129\n00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.242\nI know that proposition,\njust stepping into this,\n\n130\n00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:34.525\nthis situation where we\nhave to harden systems for\n\n131\n00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:38.994\nthe very first time, it can be\na scary proposition for some people.\n\n132\n00:07:38.994 --> 00:07:43.496\nBecause you know, especially if\nthey're Internet facing systems, or\n\n133\n00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:48.293\ncritical systems, you know that you've\ngotta make every effort possible to\n\n134\n00:07:48.293 --> 00:07:53.233\nget that right and if you don't, you know\nwhat the consequences could be is that\n\n135\n00:07:53.233 --> 00:07:57.363\nSomeone could get into that system and\nwalk away with your data, or\n\n136\n00:07:57.363 --> 00:08:00.560\ncause mayhem or\nall sorts of things with it.\n\n137\n00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.390\nAnd that's going to cost the company\nyou're doing this work for.\n\n138\n00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.100\nIt's gonna cost them a lot and\nembarrassment.\n\n139\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.000\nAnd money and time and all that.\n\n140\n00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.620\nAnd it could very well cost you your job,\nand\n\n141\n00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.930\nmaybe even in some cases if you're\nshown to be just flat out negligent,\n\n142\n00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:25.280\nyou could be facing legal remedies\nas well, to put it that way.\n\n143\n00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.440\nSo, it's something that you've got to take\nseriously, but don't be afraid of it,\n\n144\n00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.630\njust know that you're gonna have to roll\nup your sleeves, do some work, but we have\n\n145\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:40.700\nwhite papers, books, and all those things\nout there to help you, so we like that.\n\n146\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.340\nAlways good.\n\n147\n00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.820\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n148\n00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.030\n>> Take advantage of the,\nMicrosoft for example.\n\n149\n00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.840\nI know that's one that I'm familiar with.\n\n150\n00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.790\nThey've got all kinds of best\npractices out there, and\n\n151\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.510\nthey've got a lot of experience\ndealing with Microsoft servers.\n\n152\n00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.400\nThey've got a lot of organizations\nthat they, they help support.\n\n153\n00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.550\nThese are big, large companies.\n\n154\n00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.130\nSo when they talk about best practices,\n\n155\n00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.850\nthey've got a pretty good idea of\nhow to keep those servers secure.\n\n156\n00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.470\nSo why reinvent the wheel?\n\n157\n00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.170\nWhy not go out and\n\n158\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.240\nget those papers from these\norganizations that make them available?\n\n159\n00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.190\nYeah, absolutely,\nuse what's available to you.\n\n160\n00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.670\nDon't be afraid of the process of doing\nthis and don't go into it, your nose in\n\n161\n00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:21.270\nthe air and think you know everything,\ncuz you don't, you know, no one does.\n\n162\n00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.713\nNow I know.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:09:22.713 --> 00:09:24.860\n>> Oh yeah, they say nobody is perfect.\n\n164\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.520\nI define perfection as me done.\n\n165\n00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.182\nI'm measuring.\n\n166\n00:09:27.182 --> 00:09:31.312\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [INAUDIBLE] My nose going in the air.\n\n167\n00:09:31.312 --> 00:09:34.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Guys in the back are climbing the desk,\n\n168\n00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.356\nit's getting thick.\n\n169\n00:09:36.356 --> 00:09:39.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we have, so we've got.\n\n170\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.590\n>> You know, that, you know that part of,\nyou know things done.\n\n171\n00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.090\nSo hopefully you're,\nyou're gonna step up and do this.\n\n172\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.480\nAnd talk to, talk to, and\n\n173\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.780\ntalk to other people and\nget your work done on that side.\n\n174\n00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.420\nAnd get a plan of attack going,\nget your base lines established.\n\n175\n00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.770\nNow is time for you to start figuring\nout how you're gonna implement those.\n\n176\n00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.890\nAnd you've got, oh,\na lot of options there too.\n\n177\n00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:08.000\nYou have things like your\nsystem's management software,\n\n178\n00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.310\nthat not only track your assets, but\nalso have ways of pushing out stuff.\n\n179\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.740\nI mean, we've been have stuff\nlike in the past SMS, or\n\n180\n00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.900\nconfiguration manager now,\nwhat's the other one?\n\n181\n00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.240\nI always script the name Altruist or\nsomething\n\n182\n00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.150\n>> Alturist?\n\n183\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.850\n>> Yeah [INAUDIBLE] there's\na lot them out there\n\n184\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.190\nthat do these sort of things and then.\n\n185\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.050\n>> Of course you have stuff like group\npolicy that can help you out, I mean,\n\n186\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.860\nit's designed to do stuff like that.\n\n187\n00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.320\nSo you got a lot of powerful things\nthat you can bring to bear to solve this\n\n188\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.460\nproblem and do it very quickly, so\nthat's another great benefit of this.\n\n189\n00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.040\nBut, it'll still require\nyou to do your actual work,\n\n190\n00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.730\nand when you're someone\nthat's at a CASP level.\n\n191\n00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.730\nKeep in mind that this is something\nthat not only do you have to create, but\n\n192\n00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.780\nyou have to figure out a way to\nimplement it, and evaluate it regularly,\n\n193\n00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.760\nas well as consider the fact that\nthis is a living, breathing process.\n\n194\n00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.110\nIt's not something that you do once and\nokay, I'm done,\n\n195\n00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.440\nI'm out, I'm at the end of the day.\n\n196\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.550\nNo, it's something that you\nhave to redo the baselines,\n\n197\n00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.380\nyou have to reevaluate the roles,\ncuz roles might fall out of favor,\n\n198\n00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.100\nthey might be combined,\nnew ones might come in.\n\n199\n00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.330\nYou might have new devices come in.\n\n200\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.560\nWhat are you gonna do about\nthose Android devices or\n\n201\n00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.730\niOS devices that come into play\nthat weren't there before?\n\n202\n00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:29.440\nYou need to now say, okay I need to figure\nout how do I deal with those devices?\n\n203\n00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.850\nHow to write baselines for them, and\nhow do I enforce those baselines or\n\n204\n00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.270\nimplement the baselines?\n\n205\n00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.820\nYeah so, there's a lot of\nthings I could go into it but\n\n206\n00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.520\nit's the stuff I mention before,\nbut also it's living and\n\n207\n00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.010\nbreathing and figure out or\nplan how often this is gonna be done.\n\n208\n00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:51.690\nMost places will do it, or\nat least glance at it like every year to\n\n209\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.830\nsomeone there to make sure that\nthose things are still on track.\n\n210\n00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.730\nAnd if there's any major changes,\nI like to call them triggering events.\n\n211\n00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.390\nIf there's any sort of triggering events,\n\n212\n00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:05.520\nthey will use that to say,\nokay, we're not gonna wait for\n\n213\n00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.810\nthe regularly scheduled time,\nwe're just gonna go ahead and do it now.\n\n214\n00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.774\nLike we just had it today, or\nyesterday or whatever with Windows 10,\n\n215\n00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.920\nIf that's coming into your environment,\nyou know, very quickly, well guess what?\n\n216\n00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.050\nIf you just did your evaluation of\nyour baselines and roles and all that,\n\n217\n00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.190\nyou know six months ago,\nwhat are you going to do?\n\n218\n00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.290\nWait another year and a half to do it?\n\n219\n00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.130\nAnd Windows 10 is going\nto sit there with the old\n\n220\n00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.430\nguidelines maybe from Windows 7 in there.\n\n221\n00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.160\nCourse not.\n\n222\n00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.470\nThat would be a very bad move, because\nmaybe those work but how do you know?\n\n223\n00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.080\nYou haven't you just made an assumption.\n\n224\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.970\nYou know so\nyou want to be careful with that, but\n\n225\n00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.480\nlike I said there's lots of\nstuff out there to help you.\n\n226\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.240\nI've already seen today,\nyesterday I was looking at it.\n\n227\n00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.410\nThere's already plenty of security\ndocumentation out there already for\n\n228\n00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:01.750\nWindows 10, up to and including stuff\nlike the pen testing and even forensics.\n\n229\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.680\nSo if you wanna get in and\nstart doing that, you can.\n\n230\n00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.670\nFirst I'm gonna check and\nsee why you downloaded 10,\n\n231\n00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.990\ncuz that's a crime in itself.\n\n232\n00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.720\nIt's late in the day.\n\n233\n00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.430\nI'm doing it.\n\n234\n00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.605\nI don't care.\n\n235\n00:13:14.605 --> 00:13:15.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n236\n00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.370\ndo you have anything you\nwanna show us today?\n\n237\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.940\nYou wanna move into IPS and IDS?\n\n238\n00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.130\n>> Let's take a look at the exploit hosted\n\n239\n00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:30.910\nmanagement mitigation toolkit.\n\n240\n00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.870\nWhat I wanna start off on,\njust to give you a really quick overview\n\n241\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:40.190\nof this before I switch\nover to the tool itself.\n\n242\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:45.370\nThis is a guide that the NSA put out,\n\n243\n00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.030\na formal presentation\nthat they put out on it.\n\n244\n00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:54.120\nIt talks about what it's\nsupposed to do for it.\n\n245\n00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:59.120\nI'm not gonna read the whole thing to you,\nbut what it does is,\n\n246\n00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.700\nthis toolkit is designed to help you look\nat your applications and you environment.\n\n247\n00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.790\n>> And then help you take actions\n\n248\n00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.380\nto bring it down to a point where it\nis a more manageable or more secure,\n\n249\n00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.330\nso this is one of those things that we're\ntalking about earlier that there are's\n\n250\n00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.190\nplenty of guidance out there\nto help you with this stuff.\n\n251\n00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.480\nThis is just one of those\nthings that go with it.\n\n252\n00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.540\nIt's not an exhaustive detailed,\nyou know, crazy.\n\n253\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.541\n>> You know, a long read, but\n\n254\n00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:33.390\nit does have good information on\nwhat the EMET's supposed to do.\n\n255\n00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:38.410\nIt tells you a bunch of little details and\nwhere they positioned it,\n\n256\n00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:45.190\nand Microsoft and\nother people in the industry do work\n\n257\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:50.160\nwith NSA, for example to help them,\nyou know, develop some of these guides.\n\n258\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.460\nSo, you know,\nthis isn't just NSA saying this.\n\n259\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.500\nThis is both the vendors themselves, as\nwell as other security experts come in and\n\n260\n00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.920\nhelp put these guides together.\n\n261\n00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.010\nSo that's where this is\nkind of coming from.\n\n262\n00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.160\nYou know?\n\n263\n00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.890\nSo, this is what that guide\nis just to kind of show you,\n\n264\n00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.570\nyou know, what's going through here.\n\n265\n00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:11.640\nAnd this does quite a bit.\n\n266\n00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.800\nIt's a very good read,\nif you have the time to look at it.\n\n267\n00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.270\nIt's about 12 pages, but\nit's mostly graphs and stuff like that.\n\n268\n00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.090\nBut just FYI,\nthat's just kinda something out there.\n\n269\n00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.830\nIt's on the EMET, and\nthen Microsoft also has\n\n270\n00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.010\nsome documentation on their site\nthat tells you how to use it.\n\n271\n00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:34.480\nThey've got a brief PDF that kind of shows\nyou, hey this is what they emat does,\n\n272\n00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.800\nand then you just get in and\nstart working with it.\n\n273\n00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.069\nSo kind of wanted to point\nthat out you know to you.\n\n274\n00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:46.144\nThis is something that this presentation\nwas in October of last year,\n\n275\n00:15:46.144 --> 00:15:50.798\nso right around the time the last\nmajor update to EMET came up so.\n\n276\n00:15:50.798 --> 00:15:52.156\nJust FYI.\n\n277\n00:15:52.156 --> 00:15:55.045\nAll right, so this is the EMET right here,\n\n278\n00:15:55.045 --> 00:15:58.710\nthe Enhanced Mitigation\nExperience Toolkit.\n\n279\n00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:03.630\nIt's just, as you can see,\nit's fairly simple looking,\n\n280\n00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.370\nbut it actually does quite a bit.\n\n281\n00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.580\nIt's kind of like\n\n282\n00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:15.840\nthe Baseline Security Analyzer that\nMicrosoft has had for a long time.\n\n283\n00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:21.430\nIt's sorta along those lines, but\nit goes several steps up above that.\n\n284\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:26.300\nWhere the MBSA looks at the OS and\njust a couple applications,\n\n285\n00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:31.470\nthis builds on top of\nall that substantially.\n\n286\n00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.730\nSo what we can do here is,\nyou can see it tells you,\n\n287\n00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.880\nthis is what the current\nstatus of the system is.\n\n288\n00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.110\nBut it's also designed to help you give\ninformation about applications as well as\n\n289\n00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.610\nit's even got a simple wizard\nin here that you can click, and\n\n290\n00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.370\nwhen I go to that wizard\nit will pop back up.\n\n291\n00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:52.080\nIt will give the ability to either\naccept what it considers to be\n\n292\n00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.900\nrecommended actions to do on the system\nto mitigate some of the basic\n\n293\n00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:03.100\nthings that we have or\nyou can tweak it out later on.\n\n294\n00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.700\nYou can do a lot of stuff here.\n\n295\n00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.430\nSo if I said, use recommended settings,\n\n296\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.660\nit tells you right up front, it's not\ntrying to really hide anything from you.\n\n297\n00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.160\nIt tells you, hey, this is the stuff\nthat it's gonna do for you and\n\n298\n00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.649\nmake sure that these things are in\nplace to make make things safer.\n\n299\n00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.300\nSo I just click on it and it comes\nback and it's applied that guidance.\n\n300\n00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.060\nI can also do the same thing\nwith apps on here too.\n\n301\n00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:30.960\nYou can see on screen I just went\nahead and turned on the apps\n\n302\n00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.940\npart of it and when I clicked on that,\nlook at what it has.\n\n303\n00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:40.710\nIt has a list of the applications\non my system that it,\n\n304\n00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:45.540\nthe ones that recognizes right off the\nbat, I can actually click add application\n\n305\n00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.358\nand go browse for\nother things on my of file system,\n\n306\n00:17:48.358 --> 00:17:51.060\nadd those in and\nthen just go through the list and\n\n307\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.380\ntell it what features I want this tab\nto have access to as an application.\n\n308\n00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.380\nI mean, these things are,\nsome of these things are,\n\n309\n00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.530\nyou're gonna have to do a good amount of\nresearch on to figure out what they mean.\n\n310\n00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.690\nSome of these things are only gonna\nmean stuff to a programmer and\n\n311\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:11.440\nthey're not gonna mean anything for\nthe rest of us, so\n\n312\n00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.500\nmaybe you want to leave them the way they\nare but you always should double check.\n\n313\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.360\nSo we have those type of things.\n\n314\n00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.770\nThen it also has stuff telling\nyou how it's gonna manage memory.\n\n315\n00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.610\nIn this case its got stuff with WEP and\nall these other things.\n\n316\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.525\nThat's a weirdest name for\na feature on a Heap Spray.\n\n317\n00:18:30.525 --> 00:18:32.510\n>> [LAUGH] Heap Spray?\n\n318\n00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.685\n>> The heck is that?\n\n319\n00:18:33.685 --> 00:18:36.292\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I really don't really wanna know.\n\n320\n00:18:36.292 --> 00:18:38.103\n>> [LAUGH] We'll leave that one alone.\n\n321\n00:18:38.103 --> 00:18:39.680\nToo many jokes there.\n\n322\n00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.585\n>> New from Ocean Spray, Heap Spray.\n\n323\n00:18:41.585 --> 00:18:44.210\n>> [LAUGH] So, but\n\n324\n00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:49.450\nyou've got your applications there and\nyou can see it's\n\n325\n00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:55.400\ngot a lot of really fine-grained stuff\nthat you can do with these applications..\n\n326\n00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.510\nAnd what's really cool about it is you can\nget this stuff all set up the way you want\n\n327\n00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:06.340\nit and the way you prefer it to be, and\nthen you can just go through and export\n\n328\n00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.950\nthat and bring it into other systems and\napply that same guidance there.\n\n329\n00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:14.090\nSo what you're doing in this,\nit's creating a template that you\n\n330\n00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.770\ncan take to more and more and\nmore systems and rapidly deploy this.\n\n331\n00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.940\nSo, pretty neat tool,\n\n332\n00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:24.520\nthough you're going to have to really\ndo your homework on this stuff.\n\n333\n00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:30.350\nI mean, some of these things on here,\nor a good number of the things on here,\n\n334\n00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.700\nprobably about half of them I'd have\nto go really do a double check or\n\n335\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.276\ncheck one of my programming\nfriends to see, okay,\n\n336\n00:19:36.276 --> 00:19:41.170\ngive me the quick elevator pitch,\nas they say, on this.\n\n337\n00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.640\nTell me what that is.\n\n338\n00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.330\nYou gotta do that to programmers\notherwise you'll get all confused and\n\n339\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.670\nyour brain will crash.\n\n340\n00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:53.200\nSo but you can do that with,\nso that's the application one.\n\n341\n00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.240\nSo make sure if you're doing this\nthat you really check it out.\n\n342\n00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.950\nAnd then you've got other\nfeatures in there too.\n\n343\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.490\nYou can see,\nyou can adjust the stuff on the system.\n\n344\n00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:08.600\nYou can review the running processes and\nchange stuff with those if you needed to.\n\n345\n00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.060\nSo the end goal of this being that\n\n346\n00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.190\nit can do more than these\nother mitigation tool kits.\n\n347\n00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.990\nIt can actually go to the next level,\nand it can go to the next level and\n\n348\n00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:24.460\nreally lock them down even more\nthan these other tools could.\n\n349\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.610\nThe MBSA is just not even\ngonna get near this stuff.\n\n350\n00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:31.010\nIt's gonna go way, way underneath this.\n\n351\n00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.510\nThis is gonna be way, way above that.\n\n352\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:39.060\nThis thing does what it can to help you\nto make your life a little bit easier.\n\n353\n00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.340\nYou can even see on here, or\n\n354\n00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:45.430\nyou can set up your own profiles on\nhere so it knows what to look for.\n\n355\n00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:50.380\nI could say, hey, I wanna change my\nsecurity, the maximum level of security.\n\n356\n00:20:51.895 --> 00:20:55.575\nI'm not gonna do that right now cuz I\ndon't know what the impact in the system\n\n357\n00:20:55.575 --> 00:20:59.665\nis gonna be because I haven't\ntested it on this one, but\n\n358\n00:20:59.665 --> 00:21:02.505\nit's something you would want\nto check these things out.\n\n359\n00:21:02.505 --> 00:21:08.465\nYou could even use the profiles to reduce\nsecurity to another level if you want.\n\n360\n00:21:08.465 --> 00:21:10.620\nYou've got those sorts of things.\n\n361\n00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.590\nAnd then if you really get bored, as every\napplication if you wanna look like you're\n\n362\n00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.040\ndoing something, looks cools, you can\nalways change the color scheme on it too,\n\n363\n00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.130\nwhich I think is always a good feature.\n\n364\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.080\n>> Does make you look\na lot smarter there Sean.\n\n365\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.820\n>> Yeah.\n>> I agree.\n\n366\n00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.420\n>> It's the expert version.\n\n367\n00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.765\nLook, it's a darker color.\n\n368\n00:21:26.765 --> 00:21:29.650\n[LAUGHTER].\n\n369\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.460\nHow can I not be an expert with\na cool looking interface like that.\n\n370\n00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:40.070\nSo but that's just a kind of a quick and\ndirty overview of this tool kit.\n\n371\n00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.840\nI would think probably not a lot\nof you have heard of this or\n\n372\n00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.210\nhad experience with it.\n\n373\n00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.830\nMaybe you have, that's cool.\n\n374\n00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:52.290\nBut it's not something that everyone\nnecessarily knows about,so I'm just kind\n\n375\n00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:58.250\nof trying to put it out there and say,\nhey here's another tool you can use.\n\n376\n00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.100\nBut then you have other websites to\nhelp you with hardening the system.\n\n377\n00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.900\nThis does application stuff and\nsome of the system stuff but\n\n378\n00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:11.040\nyou have some stuff that\nisn't included here,\n\n379\n00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.630\nlike services that\nare running on the system.\n\n380\n00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:19.858\nYou can go to websites like\nblackviper.com is what I recommended.\n\n381\n00:22:19.858 --> 00:22:27.890\nIn fact, that guy's website, if I looked\nat it, I don't have it up right now, but\n\n382\n00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:32.970\nthat website I was looking at it, and\nhe even has the Windows 10 stuff up.\n\n383\n00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.005\nSo he's pretty much on his game.\n\n384\n00:22:35.005 --> 00:22:39.180\nHe's got the Windows 10 configurations for\nservices that you can turn on and\n\n385\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.250\noff safely to get your\nsystem to work better, but\n\n386\n00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.790\nyou can also use this as a way\nto get a more secure system.\n\n387\n00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:50.170\nAnd then just some other stuff\nthat can help you harden a system.\n\n388\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:55.830\nDon't forget some of the pen testing\ntools that we have at our disposal.\n\n389\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:00.065\nIf you really wanna get down to it,\nyou can use stuff like\n\n390\n00:23:00.065 --> 00:23:05.010\nNexpose', you can use stuff like Nessus.\n\n391\n00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:11.690\nThose will help you out, especially if\nyou're using something like the Microsoft\n\n392\n00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:16.270\ntechnologies because a lot of,\nwhen it finds a vulnerability on those,\n\n393\n00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.540\nit will link right back to\nthe knowledge-based article telling you,\n\n394\n00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.850\nhey this has a vulnerability.\n\n395\n00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.930\nAnd if you go right to the horse's mouth,\nyou can see this is what it is, and\n\n396\n00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.690\nthis is what they've done, and this is,\nheck, this is how you fix it or\n\n397\n00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.100\nthis is how you patch it.\n\n398\n00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:35.090\nSo it really gets you right down to\nthe basics there to help you out.\n\n399\n00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.070\nSo you've got plenty of\nresources here up and\n\n400\n00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.760\nabove just reading some white papers and\nall that.\n\n401\n00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.828\nI don't like reading white papers either.\n\n402\n00:23:44.828 --> 00:23:46.155\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Who does, right?\n\n403\n00:23:46.155 --> 00:23:48.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I didn't read my own books.\n\n404\n00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.670\nI read the check that they write me.\n\n405\n00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.172\nI don't read the books.\n\n406\n00:23:52.172 --> 00:23:55.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hey, it's all about priorities man.\n\n407\n00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.418\n>> That's right.\n\n408\n00:23:56.418 --> 00:23:59.050\n[INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n>> Alright, well Seam today with a lot of\n\n409\n00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.930\ngreat information there on learning how to\nharden our systems on our networks so we\n\n410\n00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:07.770\ncan better protect our network against all\nthose bad guys and bad things that happen.\n\n411\n00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.730\nAnything else we want to throw in\nhere before we wrap this one up?\n\n412\n00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.840\n>> No, I think that's covered\nsome pretty good ground.\n\n413\n00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.460\nI would hope that, heck,\njust this quick and dirty look, as it was,\n\n414\n00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.410\nat this EMAT, I would hope\nthat gets a good number of you\n\n415\n00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:27.520\nout here watching this to kind of say,\nhey, well maybe let\n\n416\n00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.380\nme take a look at that tool to see if\nthat's something that can help me out.\n\n417\n00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.910\nIt's just one more thing you\ncan put in your tool kit.\n\n418\n00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:33.550\nThat's the goal.\n\n419\n00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.187\n>> I'm downloading it in the background.\n\n420\n00:24:35.187 --> 00:24:35.740\n[LAUGH] Alright.\n\n421\n00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.340\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n422\n00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.500\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n423\n00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.410\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n424\n00:24:42.410 -->

00:00:16.820\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick\nwith me today Sean Ariano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.270\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.160\n>> I'm doing pretty good how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.210\n>> I cannot complain.\n\n7\n00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.950\nExcited to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.200\nWe're doing another episode on our Comtia\nAdvanced Security Practitioner series.\n\n9\n00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.790\nWe're gonna look at something\na little bit different.\n\n10\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.610\nIt's called data exfiltration.\n\n11\n00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.440\nJohn you're gonna have to\nhelp me out with that one.\n\n12\n00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.400\n>> It just sounds awesome.\n\n13\n00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.050\nI don't think we need\nto say anything else.\n\n14\n00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.554\n>> What is my data doing [CROSSTALK]\n>> That's good enough.\n\n15\n00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:38.968\n>> That's what I need to know.\n\n16\n00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:39.876\n>> It's exfiltrating.\n\n17\n00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:42.802\nSounds like we should have\na little sand table here, and\n\n18\n00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:44.554\ndrawing something out in there.\n\n19\n00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:47.268\nIt's like, we're gonna attack at dawn.\n\n20\n00:00:47.268 --> 00:00:47.819\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:51.880\n>> So but what data exfiltration is\n\n22\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.040\nis it's a fancy technical term for\n\n23\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.470\nsaying, for basically covering the concept\nof stuff leaving your organization.\n\n24\n00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.500\nIt's exfiltrating,\n\n25\n00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.190\nopposite of infiltrating, which would be\na problem too but that's for another time.\n\n26\n00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.580\n>> So this is definitely a huge,\n\n27\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.940\nhuge problem if you recast this and\n\n28\n00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.930\nput it in common terms of stuff leaving\nyour organization, information that\n\n29\n00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.230\nshouldn't be leaving your organization,\nyou realize what we're getting into.\n\n30\n00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.460\n>> So you're talking about me\nputting a file on a thumb drive and\n\n31\n00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.600\nthen walking out of the building and\nthat's information that shouldn't be\n\n32\n00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.480\nworked with outside of the organization,\nor copy a file to my phone, or something?\n\n33\n00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.830\n>> All of the above,\nwe can keep going with that.\n\n34\n00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.130\nI mean it could be anything from someone\ngoing out there and grabbing a piece of\n\n35\n00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.650\npaper, and walking out with it, you know\nwhatever, it could be a lot of things.\n\n36\n00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.620\nCovered by the term data exfiltration,\nit absolutely,\n\n37\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.240\npositively is a someone having\na flash drive, thumb drive, whatever.\n\n38\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.070\nPlugging that in and\ncarrying something out.\n\n39\n00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.610\nHappens all the time,\neither maliciously or\n\n40\n00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.130\nmore then likely someone's\njust not thinking about it but\n\n41\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.820\nthose things are easy to pop out and\npop into a system and transfer files.\n\n42\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.510\nWe're used to it every place else,\nwhy not at work?\n\n43\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.300\nWhy not make our lives easier?\n\n44\n00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.140\nEveryone wants to do that.\n\n45\n00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.390\nSo they're gonna go for\n\n46\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.640\nthat rather than necessarily thinking\nabout the security aspect of it.\n\n47\n00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.280\nSo that's just some\nthings that we consider.\n\n48\n00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.356\nIt's flash drives it's CDs and DVDs\n>> MCDs for\n\n49\n00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:33.403\nexample that's how we had\nthe stuff get over on\n\n50\n00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:38.193\nto Wiki leaks is that\nthey had an army private\n\n51\n00:02:38.193 --> 00:02:43.370\nthat he went through and was\n>> Took CDs in that were readable and\n\n52\n00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.230\nwritable and\nwiped the music off of them and\n\n53\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.296\nput stuff on and\ncarried them right back out.\n\n54\n00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:54.410\nSo there was [LAUGH] obviously\n\n55\n00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.930\na huge amount of fallout from that\n>> It ended with,\n\n56\n00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.450\nstrangely enough if you\nignore the center part,\n\n57\n00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.071\nit started with him joining the army and\ndoing this, and then he's a woman.\n\n58\n00:03:04.071 --> 00:03:05.638\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know how that ended.\n\n59\n00:03:05.638 --> 00:03:06.912\nI don't know how that happened.\n\n60\n00:03:06.912 --> 00:03:07.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But,\n\n61\n00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.890\ndon't ever read the Cliff Notes versions\nof that, because you will go, what?\n\n62\n00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.990\nSo, anyway, so that's something that.\n\n63\n00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.060\nSo there's that.\n\n64\n00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.360\nThere's also people emailing\nstuff out of an organization.\n\n65\n00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.480\nHappens far too often.\n\n66\n00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.461\nHow many times have you run into\na situation, or read about a situation,\n\n67\n00:03:29.461 --> 00:03:33.564\nwhere someone forwards an email\nthat's company confidential?\n\n68\n00:03:33.564 --> 00:03:36.200\nAnd all of a sudden,\nthat's appearing all over the place.\n\n69\n00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.620\nWasn't suppose to be that way.\n\n70\n00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.200\nHappens a lot unfortunately or\n\n71\n00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.750\nsomeone talks about something\nthey're not supposed to.\n\n72\n00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.370\nAll those things are things that\nare covered by data exfiltration, so.\n\n73\n00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.230\nAnd there's more stuff even beyond\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n74\n00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.327\nThere's plenty of ways data can, they\nalso call this data leakage sometimes,\n\n75\n00:03:57.327 --> 00:03:59.701\nthat can get out of an organization.\n\n76\n00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:03.989\nSo you really gotta write a good policy\nand you gotta have good technology and\n\n77\n00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.344\nyou gotta have good physical security to\nmake sure that this stuff this type of\n\n78\n00:04:08.344 --> 00:04:09.765\nthing doesn't happen.\n\n79\n00:04:09.765 --> 00:04:14.452\nAnd we're seeing more creative ways\neven to do this which is a scary\n\n80\n00:04:14.452 --> 00:04:18.135\nkind of thing about as there's\ngetting to be more and\n\n81\n00:04:18.135 --> 00:04:21.570\nmore kind of back door and\ncrazy ways to do it.\n\n82\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.820\n>> Social media,\nhas that changed a little bit too?\n\n83\n00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.400\nWould that be included in this?\n\n84\n00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.240\nOh, that would definitely be something\nthat could be a big player in here.\n\n85\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.920\nIt seems like no one really thinks of\nwhat they're posting on social media,\n\n86\n00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.430\nit's just a question of,\nhey let's post something on social media,\n\n87\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.980\nnot, does it belong up there.\n\n88\n00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.655\nOr, what you're sharing that they just\ndon't think about those sorts of things.\n\n89\n00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:48.615\nThen you get plenty of other\ncases on top of that with\n\n90\n00:04:48.615 --> 00:04:54.408\npeople taking pictures with their phones\nand getting that exif data on there.\n\n91\n00:04:54.408 --> 00:05:00.290\nThat is gives you GPS information, so\nthe list keeps going on and on and on.\n\n92\n00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.620\nSo you really now have to start thinking\nabout how you're gonna counter that and\n\n93\n00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.640\nthere's been a lot of brain power\ndedicated to this to how do we stop\n\n94\n00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.550\nthis from becoming a problem or\nbecoming a worse problem.\n\n95\n00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.345\nBring it down to a more manageable\nlevel and it's still is a big problem,\n\n96\n00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:25.380\nit tends to be kind of a growing problem,\nseems like almost when\n\n97\n00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.182\nyou cut off one of the heads of this,\nanother two more pop up in its place.\n\n98\n00:05:31.182 --> 00:05:33.689\nIn some cases because\njust make it easier and\n\n99\n00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.000\neasier to carry data and move it around.\n\n100\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.741\nI mean you've got, now it's stuff that\nyou couldn't get on a flash drive,\n\n101\n00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:47.860\nnow you can just upload to a cloud service\nor you can do remote access strategies.\n\n102\n00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.945\nSome people are creative\nenough to do that so\n\n103\n00:05:50.945 --> 00:05:55.925\nyou name it there's many ways to do\nthis so I guess the question would be.\n\n104\n00:05:55.925 --> 00:05:56.955\nWe could go on and on and\n\n105\n00:05:56.955 --> 00:06:02.487\non about all different ways you could\nsmuggle data out of an organization.\n\n106\n00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:06.590\nNext question is, I guess really,\nwhat do you do about it?\n\n107\n00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.024\nSo you know, well I guess-\n>> I mean I know a lot\n\n108\n00:06:10.024 --> 00:06:14.687\nof companies that put policies in place\nlike to try to block most removal media or\n\n109\n00:06:14.687 --> 00:06:18.446\nyou know, prevent writing anything\nother than the hard drive,\n\n110\n00:06:18.446 --> 00:06:21.620\nthe fixed drive that's in the computer.\n\n111\n00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.100\nLike I thought that was offline files,\nyou know,\n\n112\n00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.640\nmaking sure that same scenarios where\nsomebody's cash files locally and\n\n113\n00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.690\nthey leave and promise that,\nI thought it's stolen.\n\n114\n00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.290\nYeah, they're well hidden or\n\n115\n00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.660\nthey're easy to find on a hard drive but\nthey're still accessible.\n\n116\n00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.160\nSo Alice said, HIPPA might have\nsaid you can only access the stuff\n\n117\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.480\nwhile you're inside the organization.\n\n118\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.940\nAnd now you got those files cached on\na laptop that could easily be stolen or\n\n119\n00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.450\nlost.\n\n120\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.640\n>> Yeah,\nthat definitely is something that happens.\n\n121\n00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.300\nAnd it's funny you mentioned\nthis the HIPAA one\n\n122\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.911\nbecause I knew a woman that worked for\n\n123\n00:07:02.911 --> 00:07:08.170\na health care company, and\nthey let her work at home.\n\n124\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.833\nWhich isn't a problem, but\nshe's looking at files that are for\n\n125\n00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:19.160\ndifferent patients, which are absolutely,\npositively covered by HIPPA.\n\n126\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.130\nNow the thing is that,\nyou know she access this stuff at home,\n\n127\n00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.242\nyou know she lives alone.\n\n128\n00:07:26.242 --> 00:07:30.749\nExcept for having, I think she\nhad a cat or two if I recall, but\n\n129\n00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:36.819\nwhat they did to make sure that, in their\nmind, no one was there seeing this stuff,\n\n130\n00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:41.154\nthey had a camera when she was\nworking put on her computer and\n\n131\n00:07:41.154 --> 00:07:45.664\nthey could just at scheduled intervals,\nthey would take, or\n\n132\n00:07:45.664 --> 00:07:50.300\neven random ones they could take\npictures of what was going on.\n\n133\n00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:56.653\nAs I see there is no one else there,\nbut okay that's really gonna work.\n\n134\n00:07:56.653 --> 00:07:58.777\nIt's like oh they were taking a picture?\n\n135\n00:07:58.777 --> 00:07:59.519\nOkay.\n\n136\n00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:01.352\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Safe now, we're secure.\n\n137\n00:08:01.352 --> 00:08:03.800\nNo one's in the area of that thing.\n\n138\n00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.540\n>> Yeah.\n\n139\n00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.450\n>> So\nthat's what immediately came to mind.\n\n140\n00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.910\nIt's, yeah okay, well fine, when you're\nworking I'll just be in the other room.\n\n141\n00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.150\nThey're not going to know or I could just\nget down underneath this thing of it or\n\n142\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.650\nwhatever.\n\n143\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.026\n>> Right, or\nanother camera pointed at the screen and\n\n144\n00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:20.703\nI'm watching it from the other room,\nI mean, what the heck?\n\n145\n00:08:20.703 --> 00:08:22.360\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n146\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.882\n>> So.\n>> It was just not really, in my mind,\n\n147\n00:08:25.882 --> 00:08:28.469\na well thought out solution.\n\n148\n00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:33.360\nAnd I mean, heck she even told me at one\npoint she made a joke to them, they said,\n\n149\n00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.222\nno one's there watching this stuff, right?\n\n150\n00:08:36.222 --> 00:08:37.560\nCuz they heard TV in the background.\n\n151\n00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.210\nShe says, no, nobody except the cat, and\nthat cat doesn't really talk to anybody.\n\n152\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.110\nAnd so the person just when they're\nin like pause it's like, no,\n\n153\n00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.785\nno really is that gonna be\nokay to have that there?\n\n154\n00:08:48.785 --> 00:08:51.547\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like I think we need ISIS,\n\n155\n00:08:51.547 --> 00:08:54.082\nI think you need to get a mental\nhealth program is what you need.\n\n156\n00:08:54.082 --> 00:08:59.059\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But that was something that they did to\n\n157\n00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:04.230\nkind of prevent prying\neyes from seeing that.\n\n158\n00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:10.140\nBut it's got limited utility,\nI would think, in that situation.\n\n159\n00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.400\n>> I would just think it would be a very\ntough thing for an organization because\n\n160\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.040\nshort of stopping everybody at the door\nand searching them on their way in and\n\n161\n00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.180\non their way out,\nhow are you gonna control this?\n\n162\n00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.870\nI mean,\nhow do you stop this kind of thing?\n\n163\n00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.568\n>> Yeah, it's a very tough thing.\n\n164\n00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:35.206\nAnd organizations that are really serious\nabout this whole security proposition,\n\n165\n00:09:35.206 --> 00:09:41.842\nwhat they're gonna do is they are going to\nput very explicit policies in place saying\n\n166\n00:09:41.842 --> 00:09:47.287\nthat you're not gonna bring certain\nitems in, such as USB devices.\n\n167\n00:09:47.287 --> 00:09:49.607\nAnd they will throw\na lot of stuff on there.\n\n168\n00:09:49.607 --> 00:09:54.400\nThey will throw, with the USB devices\nthey will throw in stuff like,\n\n169\n00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.710\nnot just the regular flash drives,\nbut the portable hard drives.\n\n170\n00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:05.520\nThey will even ban music players from\ncoming in because those are really just\n\n171\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.900\na big hard drive.\n\n172\n00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.940\nAnd then they even say with cell phones,\nthere's of places\n\n173\n00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:16.050\nthat say those cell phones,\nthey don't come in certain areas, period.\n\n174\n00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:21.166\nIf they have a camera on them, that is\ngonna stop them from certain areas,\n\n175\n00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:24.560\nand other areas are like no,\nnot bringing it in.\n\n176\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.532\nI've been in places with my\ncontract with the military,\n\n177\n00:10:29.532 --> 00:10:35.230\nand being in that those phones\ndon't go in those areas.\n\n178\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.020\nIf those things happen to be found on you,\nyou're getting tackled or\n\n179\n00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:38.860\nsomething like that.\n\n180\n00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.910\nYou gotta figure a 19-year-old's\ngonna tackle you just because he can\n\n181\n00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.751\nat that point.\n\n182\n00:10:43.751 --> 00:10:46.935\n[LAUGH] But\nthat's the kind of the stuff they do and\n\n183\n00:10:46.935 --> 00:10:51.440\nif they find those things on you,\nthat's the other side of it.\n\n184\n00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.878\nAnd places that are that serious about it,\nif they find that in any way shape or\n\n185\n00:10:55.878 --> 00:10:59.565\nform one of those things made it in,\nyou're really gonna have to\n\n186\n00:10:59.565 --> 00:11:04.220\nexplain yourself at that point because\nthey are not gonna mess around.\n\n187\n00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:11.210\nThey could do everything from just\nsaying okay well, don't do it again.\n\n188\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:16.780\nOr they can take a closer examination and\nsee where you were and\n\n189\n00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.510\nwhy this happened, which they're probably\ngonna see why it happened anyway.\n\n190\n00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.360\nUp to firing you and even bringing\nyou up on charges in some cases.\n\n191\n00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.100\nThey can do that,\ndepending on the situation.\n\n192\n00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.779\nAnd that brings up another point here,\nis that you can't have a situation where,\n\n193\n00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:39.635\nany sort of policy can't just exist and\nsay you're not gonna do this,\n\n194\n00:11:39.635 --> 00:11:42.130\nand not have any sort of teeth to it.\n\n195\n00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:46.750\nIf it doesn't have any teeth to it,\nsaying they're going to smack you around\n\n196\n00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:51.620\nbig time if you do this,\nthen what's the point?\n\n197\n00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.460\n>> Gotta be some repercussions to\nthose kind of actions in other words.\n\n198\n00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.790\n>> Yeah, that's absolutely correct.\n\n199\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:01.910\nIf you don't have something that says hey,\nthis is gonna be the outcome\n\n200\n00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:07.185\nif you do this then who's gonna care?\n\n201\n00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.775\nI'm not gonna care about it.\n\n202\n00:12:08.775 --> 00:12:11.325\nI'm just gonna be, okay,\nyeah sure, whatever.\n\n203\n00:12:11.325 --> 00:12:15.160\nYou want me to bring it in,\nI'll remember not to do that next time.\n\n204\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.680\nAnd I've been in places like that.\n\n205\n00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.730\nI was in one place in particular\nwhere I wasn't briefed on it.\n\n206\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.880\nMy escort didn't brief me on the fact\nthat I wasn't supposed to have\n\n207\n00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.870\na removable hard drive on me\nwhen I went in that facility.\n\n208\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:32.570\nAnd when I pulled it out,\nman you would have thought that hey,\n\n209\n00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:37.580\na guy did something really, really,\nwhich I did do something really bad.\n\n210\n00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.340\nYou would've thought I kicked a puppy or\nsomething like that, I don't know.\n\n211\n00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:46.043\nPeople were like [SOUND] and all the air\nwent out of the room like, what?\n\n212\n00:12:46.043 --> 00:12:48.390\n[LAUGH] And they were going you're\nnot supposed to have that in here,\n\n213\n00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.448\ndon't bring that in here, what happened,\nwhy didn't, and so didn't you know this?\n\n214\n00:12:51.448 --> 00:12:52.792\nAnd I was like, know what?\n\n215\n00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:55.228\nAnd they found out the person\nthat was my escort and\n\n216\n00:12:55.228 --> 00:12:59.410\nthat initially brought me in never\nbriefed me and he was told to brief me.\n\n217\n00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:04.110\nSo guess who got in really big\ntrouble about the whole thing?\n\n218\n00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.180\nThey knew I wasn't anywhere because\nI was being observed the whole time.\n\n219\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.590\nHim, they're saying,\nis this how you operate really?\n\n220\n00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.910\nWe're trusting you with all these\nclearances and all that and\n\n221\n00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.110\nyou're not doing this?\n\n222\n00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:19.750\nSo, yeah they take it pretty seriously\nif you do these sorts of things.\n\n223\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.980\nBut that's just the USB devices.\n\n224\n00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:27.030\nThings like a papers,\npeople walking out with these things.\n\n225\n00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:32.040\nAny sort of paperwork that's just out\nthere, if you're not actively using it,\n\n226\n00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.740\nkeep an eye on it.\n\n227\n00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.470\nIt needs to be locked up,\nbecause when you're not there,\n\n228\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.470\nsomeone can very easily walk away from it.\n\n229\n00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:43.250\nAnd by the time you find out it's gone,\nit might be too late.\n\n230\n00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.830\nSo you've got that.\n\n231\n00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:48.502\nIt's also with things like cloud services\nwe talked about if you're gonna have cloud\n\n232\n00:13:48.502 --> 00:13:49.730\nservices.\n\n233\n00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.910\nNothing wrong with having a cloud service,\nbut the problem there comes in is that\n\n234\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.960\nyou're gonna have to limit and\nblock those sites so you can't use those.\n\n235\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.320\nJust like a lot of places\ndon't allow employees or\n\n236\n00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.260\nwhoever's there to use web mail for\nthe exact same reason.\n\n237\n00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.474\nThey do not want them spreading\nthe stuff through the email, or\n\n238\n00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:13.540\nwhatever, they're saying\nthat's just not gonna happen.\n\n239\n00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.630\nSo a lot of different\ntechniques that can be done.\n\n240\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.068\nBut you have to stay on top of it,\nyou have to do audits,\n\n241\n00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:22.350\nyou have to keep an eye on it.\n\n242\n00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:27.115\nAnd most of all, since a lot of\ndata exfiltration stuff is gonna be\n\n243\n00:14:27.115 --> 00:14:31.550\nsomething that's initiated on\nthe side of the human being.\n\n244\n00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.930\nIt's not a technology failure,\nit's a problem with the human element.\n\n245\n00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.470\nYou're gonna have to have\nsomething in there that says,\n\n246\n00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.560\nhey this is what's gonna happen if\nyou happen to screw up and do this.\n\n247\n00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.589\nWe're gonna do something about it.\n\n248\n00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.730\nAnd you have to be\nconsistent about it too.\n\n249\n00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.720\n>> And I know there's some technologies\nwe can probably put in place,\n\n250\n00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.808\nlike Microsoft has their rights management\nserver that I think let's you control\n\n251\n00:14:53.808 --> 00:14:57.040\nwhether the emails are allowed\nto go out of your domain.\n\n252\n00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.120\nOr, what was the other\none I was thinking of?\n\n253\n00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.480\nOh, dynamic access control.\n\n254\n00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.050\nYou can access this file but\nonly from this particular workstation, so\n\n255\n00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.450\nmaybe that can help limit\nsome of that exfiltration.\n\n256\n00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:12.330\n>> Yeah, you can definitely do\nsomething like rights management,\n\n257\n00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.402\nthat's a very good point.\n\n258\n00:15:13.402 --> 00:15:18.182\nIn fact, I think that was the main kind of\nthrust behind that technology was to make\n\n259\n00:15:18.182 --> 00:15:21.740\nsure stuff doesn't cross that\nline into the outside world.\n\n260\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:26.828\nThey're making sure that they can apply\ncertain usage rights to it to make\n\n261\n00:15:26.828 --> 00:15:32.671\nsure that you only can consume the data a\ncertain way if you're working internally.\n\n262\n00:15:32.671 --> 00:15:36.890\nAnd if you're outside then a whole\ndifferent set of things apply.\n\n263\n00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:42.258\nBasically, you're really not gonna\nbe able to use that stuff at all.\n\n264\n00:15:42.258 --> 00:15:47.655\nSo they've really stepped up the game\nwith the digital stuff on there.\n\n265\n00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:51.135\nSo if someone is stupid and\ndecides to forward something out, or\n\n266\n00:15:51.135 --> 00:15:53.620\njust careless cuz that happens too.\n\n267\n00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.149\nIt's not always the malicious intent,\nthey just aren't thinking.\n\n268\n00:15:57.149 --> 00:16:01.582\nWell, this also acts as a way\nto save them from themselves.\n\n269\n00:16:01.582 --> 00:16:06.570\nSo, you don't have to go through, like,\nwhat's gonna be on the news tomorrow?\n\n270\n00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.490\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\n271\n00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.951\nWho's gonna be suing us now?\n\n272\n00:16:08.951 --> 00:16:10.220\nNot any of that stuff.\n\n273\n00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.260\nYou can tell the person,\nhey, the system stopped it.\n\n274\n00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.100\nWhat was the deal here, and, you can-\n>> Honest mistake,\n\n275\n00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.600\nI was just gonna forward this email on\nto somebody but that violates policy,\n\n276\n00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.880\nand who knows what that person is\nthen gonna do with the data, right?\n\n277\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.367\nOnce you've forwarded it outside your\norganization, that person can forward it\n\n278\n00:16:28.367 --> 00:16:31.411\nonto anybody, your competition,\nprint it, post it on the Internet.\n\n279\n00:16:31.411 --> 00:16:33.660\nGood old, all kinds of crazy things.\n\n280\n00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.509\n>> Yeah absolutely, and\n\n281\n00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:41.165\njust to kind of show you how easy it\nwould be to do some of these things.\n\n282\n00:16:41.165 --> 00:16:45.669\nWhat I was doing here,\nkinda bringing up on my screen here,\n\n283\n00:16:45.669 --> 00:16:50.084\nthis is brand new,\nthis is something called the LAN turtle\n\n284\n00:16:50.084 --> 00:16:54.690\nthat Hak5 just brought out\njust a little while ago.\n\n285\n00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.290\nAnd it doesn't really look like that much.\n\n286\n00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.530\nIn fact, they've got a little\nscreen up here up top.\n\n287\n00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.330\nYou can see the device in play there.\n\n288\n00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.020\nYou can see, they've got,\nit looks like a USB network adapter.\n\n289\n00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.750\nYou can do these little things with it.\n\n290\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.130\nThe thing is,\nis that what that actually is,\n\n291\n00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.170\nis that's something that they kind\nof got it diagrammed out here.\n\n292\n00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:19.960\nWhat it does is you can take this\nthing and which really is, and\n\n293\n00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.770\nit looks like just a regular\nnetwork adapter, but on top of that\n\n294\n00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:30.390\nit's got the ability to open up\nshells remotely on a system.\n\n295\n00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.410\nSo you plug this in and\n\n296\n00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.820\nyou configure it, then just take it,\nplug it in, pop the network cable in it.\n\n297\n00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:41.805\nLooks just like a regular\nUSB network adapter and\n\n298\n00:17:41.805 --> 00:17:47.070\nsince it's purposely made to look\nlike that, it's very easy for\n\n299\n00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.850\nsomeone to say, okay,\nthere's nothing wrong here, and move on.\n\n300\n00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:56.830\nSo this could be yet another way of\ngetting data out of an organization.\n\n301\n00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:01.600\nAnd granted, if you're seeing something\nlike this, this is malicious.\n\n302\n00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.020\nOnce you find out who did it,\nthis is someone that you really need to\n\n303\n00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:10.500\ntake a rubber hose to or something,\nand figure out why they're doing this.\n\n304\n00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:15.630\nIt needs to be investigated cuz you don't\nhave someone innocently plug that in.\n\n305\n00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.120\nIf they're doing that and can figure all\nthis stuff and do all the things it takes\n\n306\n00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.900\nto make this happen,\nthey know what they're doing, period.\n\n307\n00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.540\nSomething really needs\nto be done about it.\n\n308\n00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.760\nBut, yeah it's got all these\nlittle features in it.\n\n309\n00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.520\nIt actually literally\ncan be fully configured.\n\n310\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.890\nIt's got its own attacks built in.\n\n311\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.690\nI mean, if you look at this,\n\n312\n00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:40.870\nyou probably can't see it too well on your\nscreen, but maybe we can zoom up a bit.\n\n313\n00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:45.702\nIf you look at this thing, it's literally\ngot the ability to open a Meterpreter,\n\n314\n00:18:45.702 --> 00:18:48.024\nif you remember that from Metasploit.\n\n315\n00:18:48.024 --> 00:18:51.760\nIt can do that so\nit can give you that access to a system.\n\n316\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:57.606\nIt's got the ability to DNS spoofing,\nto go through and do SSH,\n\n317\n00:18:57.606 --> 00:19:03.720\nNetcat, Nmap, it got the ability to\nproxies, it can do stuff with email.\n\n318\n00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.738\nI mean,\nit can do some pretty nasty things.\n\n319\n00:19:06.738 --> 00:19:11.351\nOnce you've plugged this in some place and\nthe blinking little lights come in and\n\n320\n00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:17.128\neverything, it's almost indistinguishable\nfrom any other network adapter.\n\n321\n00:19:17.128 --> 00:19:21.000\nIt just looks like\na regular Ethernet adapter.\n\n322\n00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.900\nYou plug in, pop it in, and\nyou saw in there they just\n\n323\n00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.790\nput a piece of masking tape on and\nsaid, oh yeah, don't remove.\n\n324\n00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.470\n>> IT, do not remove, I like that.\n\n325\n00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.050\n>> It probably would work [LAUGH]\nto have something like that and\n\n326\n00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.810\nreally I have one of these myself.\n\n327\n00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.908\nNot that much, look at that,\nI mean 50 bucks.\n\n328\n00:19:39.908 --> 00:19:43.377\nYeah, 50 bucks you can have\none of these things and,\n\n329\n00:19:45.397 --> 00:19:49.670\nStart causing all sorts of mischief.\n\n330\n00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.249\nAnd to show you the thought process here,\n\n331\n00:19:52.249 --> 00:19:57.054\nis with a pen tester you wouldn't\nnecessarily wanna do something like this.\n\n332\n00:19:57.054 --> 00:20:02.643\nBut for someone that's malicious, a black\nhat that gets access to those things,\n\n333\n00:20:02.643 --> 00:20:08.799\n50 bucks, one of the things about it being\nthat cheap, relatively speaking of course,\n\n334\n00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:12.830\nyou configure it, plug it in,\nget your access to it.\n\n335\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:13.925\nYou don't go back and get it.\n\n336\n00:20:13.925 --> 00:20:15.540\nJust leave it there, it's 50 bucks.\n\n337\n00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.700\nIf I'm a black hat, once I get what I\nwant and get the access that I want and\n\n338\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.240\nI've stolen your information,\nI'll go sell your information for\n\n339\n00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.080\nthousands of dollars out there.\n\n340\n00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.464\n50 bucks, it's a drop in the bucket.\n\n341\n00:20:27.464 --> 00:20:33.450\nSo it really doesn't matter\nat that point to that person.\n\n342\n00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.823\nSo very, very inconspicuous,\nit just does everything,\n\n343\n00:20:37.823 --> 00:20:42.031\nit looks and\nfeels just like a regular network adapter.\n\n344\n00:20:42.031 --> 00:20:45.400\nAnd you'd have to take a close inspection.\n\n345\n00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.245\nOne of the only ways you can tell\nis to flip the thing over and\n\n346\n00:20:49.245 --> 00:20:53.670\nit's got the little label on\nthe back that identifies,\n\n347\n00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.460\nhas a MAC address setting on it.\n\n348\n00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.422\nIt actually says generic\nUSB adapter on it.\n\n349\n00:20:58.422 --> 00:21:00.117\n[LAUGH] That's how they did it.\n\n350\n00:21:00.117 --> 00:21:02.485\nIt's like, oh,\nI wonder who the generic corporation is?\n\n351\n00:21:02.485 --> 00:21:03.483\nIf you do that, you fail.\n\n352\n00:21:03.483 --> 00:21:04.677\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n353\n00:21:04.677 --> 00:21:09.088\nif you see generic network adapter on it,\nyeah okay, sure.\n\n354\n00:21:09.088 --> 00:21:13.730\nBut that's one of the new things\nthat has actually been put out into\n\n355\n00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.100\nthe environment to make your life\njust that much more difficult.\n\n356\n00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.503\nAnd that's not even bringing the stuff\ninto play like the USB Rubber Ducky and\n\n357\n00:21:21.503 --> 00:21:22.798\nstuff like they have.\n\n358\n00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:26.398\nAnd then heck, we even talked about, you\nand I were talking yesterday about the one\n\n359\n00:21:26.398 --> 00:21:29.340\nthe Israelis came up with,\nyou guys can look at this one on your own.\n\n360\n00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.080\nThe Israelis came up with one\nthat they figured out how to,\n\n361\n00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.180\nonce they plant a piece of\nmalware onto a air gap system, so\n\n362\n00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.820\nyou have a network that's air\ngapped from everything else.\n\n363\n00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.240\nOnce someone gets into\nthose air gap systems and\n\n364\n00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.488\ncan plant a small piece\nof malware in there.\n\n365\n00:21:44.488 --> 00:21:47.504\nThey can use a cellphone and\nuse just regular GSM and\n\n366\n00:21:47.504 --> 00:21:52.450\nradio frequency signals to actually\nsee what's going on in that system.\n\n367\n00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.810\nNo wireless adapter or anything required.\n\n368\n00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:59.910\nIt's just the fact that that system,\nwhen electronic equipment\n\n369\n00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:05.060\nhas all that stuff passing through it,\nit's actually generating waves.\n\n370\n00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.720\nThey're using this stuff to actually\nconfirm it and read it remotely.\n\n371\n00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.680\n>> Scary stuff, tough to try to\nprevent this data exfiltration.\n\n372\n00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.020\nAll right, so Sean, anything else\nwe wanna throw in on this one?\n\n373\n00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:23.015\n>> Except to remember that this is\nsomething that you're gonna address\n\n374\n00:22:23.015 --> 00:22:26.558\nthrough physical security,\nchecking people.\n\n375\n00:22:26.558 --> 00:22:29.407\nThen policies to tell and\ntraining to let them know,\n\n376\n00:22:29.407 --> 00:22:32.820\nthat would all fit in\nthe administrative side.\n\n377\n00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.183\nAnd the punishment side too if\nsomething happens, three strikes,\n\n378\n00:22:36.183 --> 00:22:37.428\nyou're out rule maybe.\n\n379\n00:22:37.428 --> 00:22:40.070\nAnd then the technology part of it.\n\n380\n00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:43.690\nOne of the ways you can stop\nsomething like a LAN turtle would be\n\n381\n00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.520\nto be checking for\nsuspicious traffic on your network.\n\n382\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.160\nThat's what an IDS does.\n\n383\n00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.570\nYou look at those things and go why is\n\n384\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.080\nthat machine opening a connection\nto something outside my network?\n\n385\n00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.368\nThat should not be happening.\n\n386\n00:22:56.368 --> 00:22:58.150\nSo you can track it down.\n\n387\n00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:03.150\nBut that requires you to be on your game\nand recognize that that could happen.\n\n388\n00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.581\nAnd to have things that look for\nsuspicious activity.\n\n389\n00:23:05.581 --> 00:23:06.487\n>> Oh, good.\n\n390\n00:23:06.487 --> 00:23:08.809\nAll right,\nwell again another great episode, but\n\n391\n00:23:08.809 --> 00:23:12.090\nlooking at the clock it's about time for\nus to wrap things up.\n\n392\n00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.630\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n393\n00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.740\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n394\n00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.030\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n395\n00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:22.880\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:13.586\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:15.451\nWith me today is Sean Oriano.\n\n5\n00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:16.950\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.235\n>> I'm feeling pretty good today.\n\n7\n00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:20.350\n[LAUGH] How you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.200\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.890\nGlad to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.892\nWe've got another exciting\nepisode coming your way in our\n\n11\n00:00:23.892 --> 00:00:26.840\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner\nseries.\n\n12\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.220\nIn this episode, Sean, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at application security.\n\n13\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.870\nNow, we've already taken a look at\nhardening hosts and what that involves,\n\n14\n00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.760\nnow we're gonna look at the applications\nthat run on top of those hosts, and\n\n15\n00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.760\nthis is a big part of security-net,\nthere's a lot of vulnerabilities that can\n\n16\n00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.605\nbe introduced with applications,\nright, Sean?\n\n17\n00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:46.890\n>> Oh yeah, absolutely, I mean because\nyou've got the operating system of course,\n\n18\n00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.440\nand you know as Mike was saying we went\nthrough that and talked about it, but\n\n19\n00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.100\nreally you don't install an operating\nsystem, just call it a day and\n\n20\n00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.750\nsay okay we're done.\n\n21\n00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.680\n>> I just like to stare\nat my pretty background.\n\n22\n00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.440\n>> Yeah, it's like, hey, look at that.\n\n23\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.750\nI don't know maybe some of you are doing\nit with Windows 10, I don't know.\n\n24\n00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.481\nIt's up to you, maybe that's all it does.\n\n25\n00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:06.035\nI don't know.\n\n26\n00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:07.098\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n27\n00:01:07.098 --> 00:01:11.760\n>> But that don't just start, well you\nstart with the Operating System but\n\n28\n00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.090\nyou don't just end there, and the thing\nyou're using the most are gonna be\n\n29\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.740\nthe applications that reside on top of it,\nso that's where you've\n\n30\n00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.450\nalso gotta focus some attention on it, and\nthe reality is with applications is you\n\n31\n00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.710\ncan focus attention on it but there's not\njust a small handful of applications.\n\n32\n00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.580\nThere might be a small handful of\napplications that you use day to day, but\n\n33\n00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.760\nthere's a whole bunch of stuff\nrunning behind the scenes.\n\n34\n00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.458\nAnd then there's a whole big\nwide world of other stuff that's\n\n35\n00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:47.440\nhappening out there that fall\nwithin the scope of applications.\n\n36\n00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.368\nSo, there's stuff that comes off the\nshelf, there's stuff that's custom made,\n\n37\n00:01:51.368 --> 00:01:53.345\nthere's stuff that's home grown.\n\n38\n00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:58.465\nI mean, there's just a ton of things,\nso those can be a big source\n\n39\n00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:02.780\nof vulnerabilities with the way you mix\nthem together and use them, and all that.\n\n40\n00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.940\n>> Yeah, it seems like,\nas far as operating systems go,\n\n41\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.350\nthere's not that many choices.\n\n42\n00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.700\nThese are big vendors and\nthey put out patches and updates.\n\n43\n00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.230\nThey're testing their product\nconstantly and it's relatively easy to,\n\n44\n00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.580\nonce you learn how to harden\nthat operating system and\n\n45\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.700\nthen if you've got 100, 1,000,\n10,000 Windows 8 clients, for example.\n\n46\n00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.240\nAnd you've got some script or\nyou've figured out some method to do your\n\n47\n00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.775\nhardening, you run through your checklist,\nand you're good to go.\n\n48\n00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:27.400\nApplications though, as you said, are so\n\n49\n00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.260\nvaried in where we get them from and\nit just seems like it's not\n\n50\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.270\nnearly as easy to keep track of all of\nthe vulnerabilities on applications.\n\n51\n00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.800\n>> Yeah, it could be a real mess and\na real nightmare with the amount of\n\n52\n00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.390\napplications that you have, and that's,\njust like I said, the off-the-shelf ones.\n\n53\n00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.780\nI mean, we're not even including\nthings like the web applications and\n\n54\n00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.840\nstuff that people have\nbuilt right in house and\n\n55\n00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.440\nthen you can even roll into that\neven the mobile stuff now a days is.\n\n56\n00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.040\nWe have a whole host of mobile\napplications out there.\n\n57\n00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.990\nAnd it's not just the ones you see and\nstuff like the Apple Store or\n\n58\n00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.670\nthe Google Play store.\n\n59\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.210\nIt's stuff outside of that, too.\n\n60\n00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.590\nThere's a lot of even\nblack market stuff and\n\n61\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.700\nthose areas is like say, you could be\nbringing into your environment and\n\n62\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.720\npeople will bring into your environment\nand so that adds something else to it.\n\n63\n00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.790\nSo it's a very nasty thing\npotentially brewing.\n\n64\n00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.070\n>> And especially when you look\nat it like those homemade,\n\n65\n00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.540\nI say homemade applications,\nit's applications developed in house.\n\n66\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.495\nI'm not an app developer, but I could\nwhip, like one time I made something that\n\n67\n00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:37.240\nallowed somebody to copy files down\nfrom a share down to a local machine.\n\n68\n00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.820\nSo open up the dialogue box\ndid a directory listing.\n\n69\n00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.730\nThey can put check marks there and\nthey can click copy or\n\n70\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.790\nwhatever to copy them down.\n\n71\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.870\nEasy enough, but\nthere wasn't a lick of security in that.\n\n72\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.640\nThere was not a single error\nchecking line or anything.\n\n73\n00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.870\nAnd I see that a lot in these\ncompanies that maybe don't pay a big\n\n74\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.280\nsoftware developer to come in and\n\n75\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.440\nhelp them, they get somebody in-house\nthat knows just enough to get it done.\n\n76\n00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.960\nAnd they're left with a very insecure\nsolution that might work and do what they\n\n77\n00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.890\nwant it to do, but there's absolutely\nno security checks in there at all.\n\n78\n00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.652\n>> Yeah, that's a very common\nscenario to happen and it's like,\n\n79\n00:04:10.652 --> 00:04:14.470\njust play on that a computer and\nsay there you go.\n\n80\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.554\nAnd to also kind of focus on a point\nthere, to be honest, when you're saying\n\n81\n00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:25.090\nabout the homemade applications about\njust the stuff that they make in house.\n\n82\n00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.670\nRealistically nowadays,\n\n83\n00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.230\nthe homemade really can be homemade\nif you really get down to it.\n\n84\n00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.200\nI mean if you really\nwanna split hairs on it.\n\n85\n00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.075\nYou can create all sorts of applications\nwith the tools that are available.\n\n86\n00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:40.097\nIt's got, in some cases, to be that easy.\n\n87\n00:04:40.097 --> 00:04:45.355\nSome of you may know this but already,\n\n88\n00:04:45.355 --> 00:04:50.850\nbut you can create without writing really\nany code, you can create applications for\n\n89\n00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.660\nyour mobile phones, your tablets, and\nyour desktop systems already have made it.\n\n90\n00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.400\n>> Yeah, WYSIWYG type SDKs, or\nsoftware development cases,\n\n91\n00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.980\nanybody can download, access, and\nmake these applications, and then,\n\n92\n00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.300\neven scarier,\nmake them available to other people.\n\n93\n00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.070\nThen if I think I'm getting a good\napplication, because it's available on\n\n94\n00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.950\nthis webpage or this app store or what\nhave you, and unbeknownst to me, it was\n\n95\n00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.650\ndeveloped by somebody over the weekend and\nhas nothing security in it wise.\n\n96\n00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.410\nSo, yeah, it can be a challenge.\n\n97\n00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.930\n>> Yeah.\n\n98\n00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:21.560\nAbsolutely.\n\n99\n00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.000\nYou don't know what you could\nbe running into nowadays, so\n\n100\n00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.990\nthat takes us to what we can\ndo to protect ourselves.\n\n101\n00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.345\nThat was a good intro right there.\n\n102\n00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:29.845\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n103\n00:05:29.845 --> 00:05:31.209\nYeah, there was a flashlight.\n\n104\n00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:32.853\nRemember that whole scare about that\n\n105\n00:05:32.853 --> 00:05:36.200\nflashlight app?\nI think that was available on the iOS and\n\n106\n00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.350\ncome to find out, it was calling home,\nin the background.\n\n107\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.980\n>> Yeah, there were quite a few of those,\nespecially the flashlight app locations.\n\n108\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.660\nAnd quite a few of them\nwere doing just that.\n\n109\n00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.390\nSo it was kind of a widespread thing.\n\n110\n00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.470\nI remember that one as well.\n\n111\n00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.990\nI have people back home asking me,\nit's like, did you see that thing?\n\n112\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.540\nYeah, I saw that.\n\n113\n00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.540\nI know what you're talking about.\n\n114\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.400\nSo, yeah.\n\n115\n00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.360\n>> So we really got to spend as much time,\nif not more time then,\n\n116\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.070\nsecuring our applications.\n\n117\n00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.910\n>> Yeah,\nyou're going to spend a considerable\n\n118\n00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.911\namount of time doing your stuff\nwith your operating system,\n\n119\n00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:18.870\nbut the applications, that brings a whole\nbunch of other stuff with it, and\n\n120\n00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.960\nthat kind of takes you to the whole idea\nof why is it so hard to actually do that?\n\n121\n00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.020\nThat's something to kind of really spend\na little time on is why is it that,\n\n122\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.100\nrelatively speaking, it's an OS, once\nyou get the OS kind of locked down and\n\n123\n00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.950\nplanned about what features you\nwant to have and don't have.\n\n124\n00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.270\nOnce you have that, why is it so easy to\nset up something just like group policy or\n\n125\n00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.580\na template and then get that on the system\nand you know I won't say call it a day,\n\n126\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.630\nbut you know you're at\na pretty good point there.\n\n127\n00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.360\nYou can just kind of rinse and\nrepeat for the most part.\n\n128\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.800\nWhy can't you do the same\nwith applications?\n\n129\n00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.700\nWell, it's because of\na lot of it's because of\n\n130\n00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.450\nthe stuff we were just talking about\nthat you have this whole huge universe\n\n131\n00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.556\nof applications sitting out there, and\nthey come from all different sources.\n\n132\n00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:08.600\nBut then you even have questions\nof when they built those things,\n\n133\n00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.650\nwhat was the actual intention?\n\n134\n00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.310\nYou don't necessarily know what\nthe intention was when they built that.\n\n135\n00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.320\nWere they geared towards features or\nwere they geared toward security?\n\n136\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.200\nWhat side of the fence were they on?\n\n137\n00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.940\nIt's probably more than likely in most\ncases gonna be geared towards features.\n\n138\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.820\nI mean, I know the discussions\nyou're having with that,\n\n139\n00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.950\nwith the people have with the wi-fi sense.\n\n140\n00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.260\nIt sounds like from everything\nI'm hearing in the back and\n\n141\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.970\nforth you're having with\neveryone on that is that\n\n142\n00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:46.270\nthey built that with the whole idea\nof it's a convenience in mind.\n\n143\n00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.280\nThere wasn't really much in security\notherwise some of the stuff that\n\n144\n00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.030\nI've heard talked about on that they\nwouldn't have designed it that way.\n\n145\n00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.960\nNot to say it's an insecure, nasty thing.\n\n146\n00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.260\nIt could have been done better.\n\n147\n00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.240\nThey could've stepped up and\ndone it a bit better.\n\n148\n00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.272\nAnd that's not an uncommon scenario to\nrun into is that companies will You know,\n\n149\n00:08:05.272 --> 00:08:10.304\njust kind of shying off the security side\nin favor of making it more feature rich,\n\n150\n00:08:10.304 --> 00:08:13.640\nand that's where your\nproblems start to occur.\n\n151\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.699\nWe had the one just, you know,\n\n152\n00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:21.993\nas of time of tape it's a little\nbit of was Chrysler and\n\n153\n00:08:21.993 --> 00:08:26.715\nthe Jeeps, well,\nacross their product line.\n\n154\n00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:33.000\nThey had this embedded\nOS in their vehicles.\n\n155\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.180\nAnd it's because the combination\nof features and that OS and\n\n156\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.165\nyou know maybe a couple other\nfactors that was able to be hacked.\n\n157\n00:08:41.165 --> 00:08:44.740\nAnd they just focused on hey let's make\nsomething that's got all the nice bells\n\n158\n00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.780\nand whistles that makes us stand out\nover other auto manufacturers cars.\n\n159\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:54.490\nThey didn't focus on, hey how did we lock\nthis down, did we do this the proper way?\n\n160\n00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.240\nAnd then it even shows one of the other\nthings that you have to worry about,\n\n161\n00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.762\nas far as being someone that is\ndealing with software in applications.\n\n162\n00:09:02.762 --> 00:09:08.430\nI'm definitely not trying to\npick on Chrysler with this,\n\n163\n00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.300\nthey just make a good\nrecent example of this.\n\n164\n00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.210\nThey're not the only\nones that have done this.\n\n165\n00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.830\nI was showing you,\n\n166\n00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:22.970\nwe were talking about the on one of\nthe breaks about the Chrysler issue.\n\n167\n00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:27.450\nI was showing you the PDF, remember\nI showed you that, that PDF in there?\n\n168\n00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:33.280\nIf you're not aware of it,\nyou can look this up, is Chrysler, when\n\n169\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.940\nthey found this problem, they were pretty\nquick about doing something about it.\n\n170\n00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.970\nWhich, you know,\nthat's a positive to take away from it,\n\n171\n00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.600\nthat they jumped in and\nstarted working on a fix for it.\n\n172\n00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.350\nBut the fix, you know they had\nthree ways you could get it, and\n\n173\n00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.890\none of the ways was, if you couldn't\ngo into one of their dealerships,\n\n174\n00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.570\nor do it the other way they had it,\nthey would mail you a USB drive and\n\n175\n00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.650\nthey'd have a PDF file somewhere in there,\nhad the instructions in there,\n\n176\n00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:04.830\nthe instructions were like 12 pages,\nand saying here do it yourself.\n\n177\n00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.240\nAnd that's already a problem right there.\n\n178\n00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.890\nI'm thinking of so\nmany things wrong with that, to fix that.\n\n179\n00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:17.310\nBut then on top of it,\nthat guide was filled with verbiage that,\n\n180\n00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:21.020\nit would freak out a lot of people.\n\n181\n00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.660\nIf you don't know your technical stuff and\n\n182\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.820\nnot comfortable in that world,\nthat's gonna freak you out.\n\n183\n00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.680\nI'm not talking that you're\na gadget guru and like hey,\n\n184\n00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.530\nI've got the latest phone and\nstuff like that.\n\n185\n00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:34.410\nNo that was stuff in there that they're\nmentioning stuff like Akamai and\n\n186\n00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.212\nNetSession and stuff like that.\n\n187\n00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:40.792\nIt's like, those things are going over\npeople's heads, freaking out and.\n\n188\n00:10:40.792 --> 00:10:44.380\n>> I tell you I have trouble teaching\nmy users to change their homepage,\n\n189\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.470\nI can't imagine one of these\npeople at home trying to\n\n190\n00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.100\nupdate the computer system in their car.\n\n191\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.440\nI mean they're gonna call me the next day\nand say I've bricked my car last night so\n\n192\n00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.965\nI won't be coming in right.\n\n193\n00:10:54.965 --> 00:10:57.020\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that would be it and\n\n194\n00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.742\nyou know that's even funny even bring\nthat part of it up, one of the things\n\n195\n00:11:01.742 --> 00:11:05.800\nthat's been pointed out about this, and\nif you looked at the guide you'll see it.\n\n196\n00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.960\nIs that in the guide that they\nsent out with this USB drive,\n\n197\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.315\nthat guide does not not include a lick\nof information on troubleshooting.\n\n198\n00:11:16.315 --> 00:11:19.615\nThey're just kind of assuming that, hey\nyou plug it in and it's gonna work, yeah,\n\n199\n00:11:19.615 --> 00:11:22.635\nwe know how often that\npromise is delivered on.\n\n200\n00:11:22.635 --> 00:11:23.255\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n201\n00:11:23.255 --> 00:11:26.370\nI've got like, step by step by step,\nthere's no way it's gonna go wrong.\n\n202\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.955\n>> It fails, that's unpossible!\n\n203\n00:11:27.955 --> 00:11:30.530\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you know we talk about I've\n\n204\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.010\nalways learned with security that if you\ndraw a triangle on a piece of paper and\n\n205\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.020\nyou put security at one corner,\nease of use at another corner, and\n\n206\n00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.390\nthen functionality at the third corner.\n\n207\n00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.992\nI say corner,\nthe third point on that triangle.\n\n208\n00:11:42.992 --> 00:11:46.822\nAnd the you put a dot in the center and\nas you move towards functionality,\n\n209\n00:11:46.822 --> 00:11:49.840\nyou're moving away from security and\nease of use right?\n\n210\n00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:55.270\nThe more things that that application can\ndo, the less intuitive it becomes and\n\n211\n00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.755\nthe less secure it becomes,\nas you move towards ease of use.\n\n212\n00:11:58.755 --> 00:12:01.905\nIf you make it very simple and\neasy to use, it's probably not all that\n\n213\n00:12:01.905 --> 00:12:06.825\nfunctional as a pretty simple thing, and\nyou start moving away from security.\n\n214\n00:12:06.825 --> 00:12:10.445\nYou move that point down towards\nthe security point of that triangle, and\n\n215\n00:12:10.445 --> 00:12:13.485\nnow you're moving away from\nfunctionality and ease of use.\n\n216\n00:12:13.485 --> 00:12:15.485\nSo a lot of times it's trying\nto find that balance in there.\n\n217\n00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.805\nAnd then Shawn,\nwe were talking about applications,\n\n218\n00:12:17.805 --> 00:12:20.990\nI think, if we're trying to\nharden an application, you know\n\n219\n00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.930\none of the issues we run into sometimes is\nthe fact that I paid for the application,\n\n220\n00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.681\nwe didn't develop it in house,\nI don't have access to the source code.\n\n221\n00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:34.791\n>> Yeah that's one that's pointed out as\nbeing a concern a lot of areas is that,\n\n222\n00:12:34.791 --> 00:12:38.835\nI don't know what's going\non behind the curtain.\n\n223\n00:12:38.835 --> 00:12:43.835\nYou know, I just get the prepackaged\napplication, it's proprietary and\n\n224\n00:12:43.835 --> 00:12:47.243\nso I'm buying a license to use this and,\nyou know,\n\n225\n00:12:47.243 --> 00:12:52.620\nthat's the case of course as far as\napplications go with Microsoft stuff.\n\n226\n00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.570\nMicrosoft has some things to be fair,\n\n227\n00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.990\nthat are open source,\nthey do have them out there, but,\n\n228\n00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:04.200\nyou're not getting the open source on\nWindows, or Office, or any of those guys.\n\n229\n00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.070\nThat just ain't happening.\n\n230\n00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.750\nAnd before anyone kinda goes,\nnuts on that, yeah,\n\n231\n00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.600\nI'm well aware of it you're\na developer for them,\n\n232\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.714\nyou can little snippets of source code for\nWindows, that does happen.\n\n233\n00:13:14.714 --> 00:13:19.264\nI'm well aware of that but Microsoft's not\ngonna puke up their source code to Windows\n\n234\n00:13:19.264 --> 00:13:23.701\nand say, here you go, go do whatever you\nwant with it, that just doesn't happen.\n\n235\n00:13:23.701 --> 00:13:26.900\nSo that can be a concern.\n\n236\n00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.830\nHowever, I would also say,\nthe idea with open source is that\n\n237\n00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:38.610\nthe source code's there, you can audit\nit and see what's going on with it.\n\n238\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.460\nYou know suppose the idea is that you get\nthis warm, fuzzy feeling out of it, but\n\n239\n00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:48.080\nI would also kind of caution against that,\nnot saying that's a bad idea,\n\n240\n00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.030\nbut also got to remember that\njust because it's open source\n\n241\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:56.080\ndoesn't necessarily mean that\nit's any more secure for one.\n\n242\n00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.045\nAnd second of all he got source code,\nyou've got to take the time to audit that\n\n243\n00:14:00.045 --> 00:14:04.139\nand go explain that, you know, if you\nconvince your company to go open source.\n\n244\n00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:08.272\nGo convince them that if you have Linux or\nexample, which you know,\n\n245\n00:14:08.272 --> 00:14:11.100\nthat's open source,\nto tell them that yeah,\n\n246\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.740\nyou convince them to bring in Linux,\nthey're like great.\n\n247\n00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.380\nIt's like okay,\n\n248\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.940\nas far as security goes, we've got an open\nsource product, let's go audit the code.\n\n249\n00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.970\nYeah, see how well that goes over.\n\n250\n00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:27.690\nBecause not only do you more than\nlikely just not have the manpower or\n\n251\n00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:32.060\ncapabilities in house, you're gonna\nhave to go out and contract that.\n\n252\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.850\nAnd it's gonna require a lot of\nstuff to go through that code\n\n253\n00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.660\nbecause that's pretty high end stuff.\n\n254\n00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.310\nYou're not having the person that's oh,\nweekend warrior with code, do that.\n\n255\n00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:46.260\nSo, it's not necessarily just by having\nopen source code, it's been blessed and\n\n256\n00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.145\nmagically has this shield around\nit where it's nice and secure.\n\n257\n00:14:49.145 --> 00:14:50.940\nYeah, you've got the source code so\n\n258\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.760\nyou can look at it,\nI'm not trying to hide anything, but\n\n259\n00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.800\nthen again you still have to go through\nthat source code to see what's going on.\n\n260\n00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.329\nSo that's something that I kind of\nput there out there as a mighty big\n\n261\n00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:05.360\nasterisk next to it,\n[LAUGH] just to warn you.\n\n262\n00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:12.360\nIt's always been something that's\nkinda stuck with me and kinda bothered\n\n263\n00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.230\nwhen people point out, go directly to\nopen source as being, it's more secure.\n\n264\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.460\nIt's like, well,\nyou know it depends on how you look at it.\n\n265\n00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:24.190\nLet's be fair, is that yeah, it's open\nsource so yes you can see the code, so\n\n266\n00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:28.520\npresumably that means that they're saying,\nhey, you wanna look at at, there you go.\n\n267\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.710\nYou're hoping that by doing that\nthere's at least implication of,\n\n268\n00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:35.520\nsince they're not hiding it and\nletting you see it,\n\n269\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.910\nhopefully there's no shenanigans or\nanything going on.\n\n270\n00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.240\n>> Would the average person or\n\n271\n00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.530\nwhoever was looking at it actually be\nable to recognize bad code in there,\n\n272\n00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:49.720\nor a buffer overflow vulnerability when\nyou're looking at that application code?\n\n273\n00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.470\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\nI heard it for years and years.\n\n274\n00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.980\nI still hear it today is that magically,\nyou've got this suite of armor on if\n\n275\n00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.810\nyou're open source, and\nit's not that case.\n\n276\n00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.466\nThe people I used to hear make that\nA lot of people used to make that\n\n277\n00:16:05.466 --> 00:16:09.466\nclaim that open source was automatically\na great thing for security,\n\n278\n00:16:09.466 --> 00:16:14.670\nweren't even programmers, like, oh,\nI'm using this, it's all open source.\n\n279\n00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.490\nSo it's really secure.\n\n280\n00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.450\nThat would really just\nthrow that out there.\n\n281\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.210\nIt's like, really,\nhave you looked at the source code?\n\n282\n00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.520\nNo, but I can.\n\n283\n00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.241\nDo you understand the source code,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:25.850\n>> do you understand programming?\n\n285\n00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.030\nNo.\nWell, that's not really\n\n286\n00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.788\nhelping you, is it?\n\n287\n00:16:27.788 --> 00:16:31.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we've got a lot of complexities\n\n288\n00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.650\nthen when it comes to,\ntrying to harden these applications.\n\n289\n00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:42.230\n>> Yes, as far as the complexities go,\nissue goes, the point to mention there\n\n290\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:48.990\nis, with modern applications,\nit's no longer just a stand alone system.\n\n291\n00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.450\nIt hasn't been that way for years,\nwhere you just have to deal with that.\n\n292\n00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:57.580\nIt's the networked applications, and\nit was the client server initially,\n\n293\n00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:02.580\nwhich we still have that that core model,\nbut then you also have\n\n294\n00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:07.330\nsituations where it's not\njust a simple client server.\n\n295\n00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.590\nOnce you really start peeling back stuff,\nand really take a good look at it,\n\n296\n00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:14.220\nit's a distributed model,\nit's not sitting in one spot,\n\n297\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.070\nyou've got it on different servers,\nyou have different services involved.\n\n298\n00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:22.180\nWe were talking about some of that\nyesterday, to kind of take a step back\n\n299\n00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.610\nwhen we were talking about the Cloud and\nvirtualization, those things\n\n300\n00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:30.970\nare absolutely, definitely making it much\nmore distributed and much more complex.\n\n301\n00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.130\nSo now you're not just\nsaying there's stuff here,\n\n302\n00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.770\nand there's stuff there, there's stuff\nhere, there and everywhere else, and\n\n303\n00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.610\nI gotta track down all of these little\nthings and play Whack-a-Mole with\n\n304\n00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:45.990\nthe problems wherever they may happen to\nbe, and that's a massive undertaking.\n\n305\n00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.082\nIt's tough to kind of say\nit's ever gonna get done, and\n\n306\n00:17:49.082 --> 00:17:52.058\nyour gonna be able to audit\neverything 100% completely.\n\n307\n00:17:52.058 --> 00:17:55.810\nSometimes you gotta take faith\nthat the vendor you've chosen,\n\n308\n00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.480\nsince they have a good reputation, your\nhoping that they got their act together,\n\n309\n00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.410\nand you can kind of be\na little more relaxed on that.\n\n310\n00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:07.350\nSo that can be a big problem\nwith these environments as well.\n\n311\n00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.200\n>> So we really need to set\nup some kind of testing,\n\n312\n00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:15.320\nsome method that we use when we're making\na decision to purchase an application?\n\n313\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.180\n>> Yeah, there should be some\nsort of testing, testing suite or\n\n314\n00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:25.152\nsteps being done to make sure\nthat everything is above board.\n\n315\n00:18:25.152 --> 00:18:31.860\nWhen you expand out the testing model or\ntesting topic,\n\n316\n00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.510\nand remember that there should be testing\nthat's being done on the developers side,\n\n317\n00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:40.580\nto make sure that that stuffs working, and\nthen there should be testing done on your\n\n318\n00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:45.810\nside, to make sure that the stuff that\nyou want is being delivered upon.\n\n319\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.140\nWhen you bring in any new application,\nor any new environment,\n\n320\n00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.530\nI'm a big supporter of, and\nif you haven't already noticed it,\n\n321\n00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:59.520\nof having a list of things or\ncheck list of stuff that you need to see,\n\n322\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.560\nto feel comfortable that you've got,\nthat your requirements are being met.\n\n323\n00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.130\nIt's not something that you just make up\nas you go along, going oh that's good,\n\n324\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.138\nthat's good.\n\n325\n00:19:07.138 --> 00:19:11.830\nIt's fine, maybe you find something that\nis good, but you want to have some core\n\n326\n00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.630\nthings that are must haves, and if you\ndon't have that, it'll cause you to take\n\n327\n00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:21.020\na step back to see, well,\nmaybe this isn't the right thing for me.\n\n328\n00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.820\nSo that's important to have\nthat established going in.\n\n329\n00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.340\nDon't just get the stuff and\nget all dazed, and\n\n330\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.020\namazed and\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:30.990\n>> everything else\n\n332\n00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.290\nby all the little flashing buttons and\nstuff like that in there.\n\n333\n00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:39.410\nAnd you know, and all of you\nwatching this, know how that is.\n\n334\n00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:45.490\nIf you've worked in IT, and we're not\ntalking help desk stuff or anything like\n\n335\n00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:50.170\nthat, I'm talking you know you're the one\nin charge of having to make the decisions\n\n336\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:56.100\non when to deploy something, or when\nit's the right time to deploy something.\n\n337\n00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:01.010\nThink of all the times you've been around,\nwhere a new version of Windows or Office\n\n338\n00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:07.390\ncomes out, and someones saying, when\nare we gonna get the new version here?\n\n339\n00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.160\nI already know there's companies\n\n340\n00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.010\nthis week that are dealing with\nthat mess with Windows 10.\n\n341\n00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:19.620\nThere's business out there that\nare running Windows 7 right now.\n\n342\n00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.500\nThey're completely fine with it,\nthey're happy with it, and\n\n343\n00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.590\nit's doing everything you need to, from\nthe business side and the security side.\n\n344\n00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:30.180\nThey've got everything kind of stabilized\nand they're happy where it is management\n\n345\n00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.000\nwise, but then you've got people\ngoing in those same companies.\n\n346\n00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.320\nIt's like, hey,\nwhen are we getting Windows 10?\n\n347\n00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.640\nWell At some point we'll get that,\nwell when cuz I've got that at home and\n\n348\n00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.630\nI just downloaded it or\ninstalled it last night or the day before,\n\n349\n00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:48.570\nit's like well that doesn't make you an\nexpert on deploy enterprise environment.\n\n350\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.330\nNo offense, when someone at\nhome does that it's like, ok.\n\n351\n00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.270\nYou've got it, you like it,\nI'm happy for you.\n\n352\n00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.960\nBut there's different\nrequirements in that environment,\n\n353\n00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.680\nversus the enterprise environment.\n\n354\n00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.450\nI don't care how much the marketing\nteam from Microsoft, or\n\n355\n00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.630\nanybody else that's pushed that practice\nsaying that it's the greatest thing ever.\n\n356\n00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.850\nThe reality is is that I have my\nown criteria for my environment,\n\n357\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:17.410\nthat needs to be met, and\nI need to have a warm fuzzy feeling,\n\n358\n00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.470\nthat says that that product is\ngonna be okay in my environment,\n\n359\n00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.480\nnot gonna do anything crazy and\nI'm gonna be okay with that.\n\n360\n00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.070\nIt it doesn't do that,\nthen you just don't bring it in.\n\n361\n00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:32.540\nAnd, you know, the thing is, is that you\ndo have to deal with these issues today.\n\n362\n00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.320\nPeople will bring those things in,\nand heck, if it wasn't for\n\n363\n00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.290\nthings like group policies and\nstuff like that, give us the ability and\n\n364\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.390\npermissions to really\nlock the systems down,\n\n365\n00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:47.400\nyou'd have the situation we had years ago,\nwhere someone would go to IT and\n\n366\n00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.150\nsay, when are we going to get\na new copy of Office, let's say.\n\n367\n00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:54.430\nYou'd say, well,\nthe new version of Office,\n\n368\n00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.432\nwe haven't tested it yet or anything.\n\n369\n00:21:56.432 --> 00:22:00.760\nIt's gonna be, maybe six months\nto a year before we get that.\n\n370\n00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.120\nWell, that's not good enough for them.\n\n371\n00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.870\nSo, as far as they're concerned,\nthey've got a license of it at home,\n\n372\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.140\nthey can bring in and install on there.\n\n373\n00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.710\nAnd say oh well hey I've got it.\n\n374\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.570\nAnd look I solved the problem.\n\n375\n00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:12.820\nAnd to heck with IT.\n\n376\n00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.240\nThey don't know what\nthey're talking about.\n\n377\n00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.780\nI just did it right now so joke's on them.\n\n378\n00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like there's so\n\n379\n00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.630\nmany levels of wrong with that.\n\n380\n00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.500\nThey've introduced an unknown\nquantity into your network.\n\n381\n00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.650\nThey brought a home\nlicense into your stuff,\n\n382\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.630\nand that's a big problem for you and them.\n\n383\n00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:34.420\nBut there's all different levels to that,\nthat cause problems.\n\n384\n00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.630\nSo, I think probably a lot\nof us that have been around\n\n385\n00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:42.610\nIT long enough have had that very issue\noccur, and we've had to go through and\n\n386\n00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:45.710\njust smack some people on the back of\nthe head, and go don't do that again, and\n\n387\n00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.560\nlooked into how to lock\nthe systems down after that.\n\n388\n00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.540\n>> Exactly, so a lot of things have\nto be considered when we're trying to\n\n389\n00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.820\nwork with these applications,\nand secure these applications.\n\n390\n00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.670\nYou also mentioned scale in here, and\n\n391\n00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:02.570\nthat's gonna play a part in our\ndecision making process, right?\n\n392\n00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:03.670\nHow big we are?\n\n393\n00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.440\n>> Yeah, that's another big\nchallenge when you do a design, and\n\n394\n00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:12.900\nyou're putting together as\na security practitioner in the CASP.\n\n395\n00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.770\nAs a manager, you can no longer\njust focus on just the features,\n\n396\n00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.600\nand the security of it.\n\n397\n00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:25.110\nYou also have to focus on, or bring into\nthe mix, how are all those features,\n\n398\n00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:29.810\nhow's security, and how's this management\nof that product gonna come in,when I start\n\n399\n00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.200\nscaling it up from just a small.\n\n400\n00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.860\nAnd this is what happens in the end.\n\n401\n00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.714\nWhen you do your testing by the way is\nthat if you're doing your testing in\n\n402\n00:23:38.714 --> 00:23:42.947\nhouse, one of the things that's commonly\ndone is a pilot program in enterprise\n\n403\n00:23:42.947 --> 00:23:47.561\nenvironments, where they will find people\nthat represent different parts of the user\n\n404\n00:23:47.561 --> 00:23:50.908\npopulation, and that are considered\nalso to be power users and\n\n405\n00:23:50.908 --> 00:23:55.205\nhave the time to report back on things\nthey're finding when they use these things\n\n406\n00:23:55.205 --> 00:23:58.150\nin a workplace environment\nunder actual conditions.\n\n407\n00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:03.027\nThey do that to simulate what it's gonna\nbe, to simulate and get an idea of how\n\n408\n00:24:03.027 --> 00:24:08.150\nthe products gonna work under actual work\nconditions and bring it out of the lab.\n\n409\n00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.783\nBut that pilot program,\n\n410\n00:24:09.783 --> 00:24:15.460\nwhy it tries its best to simulate how that\nproduct's gonna be used, it can't simulate\n\n411\n00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:20.630\nhow it's gonna work when you start\ngetting these large-scale deployments.\n\n412\n00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:25.220\nYour pilot program in an Enterprise\nenvironment may include 50 to 100 people,\n\n413\n00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.100\nlet's say.\n\n414\n00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.670\nIf you're a large company, you may\nhave tens of thousands, or whatever,\n\n415\n00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.070\npeople to spread across the whole planet.\n\n416\n00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:36.300\nNow you've got different languages,\nyou've got all sorts of\n\n417\n00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:40.300\ninteresting deployment scenarios\nthat are gonna come into play.\n\n418\n00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.735\nAnd then there may be management issues\nthat come up, that, you're just like whoa,\n\n419\n00:24:44.735 --> 00:24:46.480\nhold on, what do I do now?\n\n420\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.952\nI mean, this stuff isn't\ngonna come up in the pilot.\n\n421\n00:24:48.952 --> 00:24:54.950\nJust to kind of use that as an example,\n\n422\n00:24:54.950 --> 00:25:01.927\nI remember running into a place that\nhad about 25,000 people minimum,\n\n423\n00:25:01.927 --> 00:25:06.760\nor thereabouts, at this one location,\nand a good portion of those\n\n424\n00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.090\npeople had computers on their desks, and\nmost of them had a couple on their desk.\n\n425\n00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.713\nAnd then there was other stuff\nthat was used in other places.\n\n426\n00:25:14.713 --> 00:25:17.780\nWell, this was back in the SMS2 days.\n\n427\n00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.270\nAnd SMS2, I mean,\nI don't know if anyone had that pain and\n\n428\n00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.320\nsuffering that went with that,\nit wasn't really the best.\n\n429\n00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:29.677\nIt wasn't until the third version\nof SMS that Microsoft really\n\n430\n00:25:29.677 --> 00:25:35.265\nbrought their A-game and got something\nthat was a really good product.\n\n431\n00:25:35.265 --> 00:25:40.340\nHad it's issues, but, still,\nthere were a lot of people that used that.\n\n432\n00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.120\nThey had their frustrations with it,\nbut they used it,\n\n433\n00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.990\nand did get some good\nbenefit out of having that.\n\n434\n00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.940\nWell, the thing was,\nis the place I was at when I came in,\n\n435\n00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.850\nI was doing some consulting, one of the\npeople I talked to, they had just moved\n\n436\n00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:01.600\nover to the third version of it, and it\nwas purring by the time I was talking to\n\n437\n00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.710\nthe guy that was in charge of making\nsure that project was working.\n\n438\n00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.730\nYou could tell he really knew what he\nwas doing, got everything all set up and\n\n439\n00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:16.690\nplanned out properly before he\ncommitted to actually deploying it.\n\n440\n00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.146\nWell, he was telling me about\nthe nightmares they had with 2, and\n\n441\n00:26:19.146 --> 00:26:22.590\nthe previous people that\nhad set this stuff up.\n\n442\n00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:27.120\nAnd what they had done is these used\npeople had clearly, at least one of\n\n443\n00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.620\nthe things they had clearly had, was\nthey had deployed 2 into a test sandbox\n\n444\n00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:37.000\nenvironment which, that's a good start,\nbut they used that to do everything.\n\n445\n00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.560\nThey didn't simulate anything\nout above that initial site, and\n\n446\n00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.390\nso they just kinda started doing\nthis piecemeal deployment with it,\n\n447\n00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:48.480\nreally not any,\nat least from what he could tell and\n\n448\n00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.730\nwhat he was telling me, there wasn't\nreally a rhyme or reason to it.\n\n449\n00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:52.990\nIt was just like, hey, you know what?\n\n450\n00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.670\nWe've got a deck of cards here and\nthere's one for you and you and you.\n\n451\n00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.326\nAnd it's like, there's pattern here?\n\n452\n00:26:57.326 --> 00:26:58.560\nNope, there you go.\n\n453\n00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.480\nThat's kind of what it\nseemed like they were doing.\n\n454\n00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.580\nIt was a mess, they had nothing but\nproblems with it.\n\n455\n00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.388\nIt was slow, it was really\ncausing all sorts of glitches.\n\n456\n00:27:07.388 --> 00:27:09.440\nYou'd mentioned features.\n\n457\n00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.570\nDon't even bring that up, you can see me,\nI'm actually having flashbacks,\n\n458\n00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.960\nbecause it wasn't planned\nin a proper manner.\n\n459\n00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.810\nIn fact, it was literally so\nbad that the guy I was talking\n\n460\n00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:26.420\nto actually was able to get a mandate and\n\n461\n00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:31.800\npermission to rip out all the SMS stuff\nthat was there, from the ground up,\n\n462\n00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:36.670\njust rip the whole thing out and\nstart from scratch.\n\n463\n00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:37.740\nNo upgrades, nothing.\n\n464\n00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.990\nEven though it was an option,\nthey were like, that's just a disaster.\n\n465\n00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:44.930\nJust get rid of that, and\nlet's start from scratch.\n\n466\n00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:49.840\nAnd that was one of the cases where it was\nbetter to go back to the drawing board and\n\n467\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.480\njust make things happen.\n\n468\n00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.300\n>> Yeah, that's an important lesson\nI know I've learned, as well.\n\n469\n00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.145\nUpgrading does not solve your problems,\nit just upgrades your problem.\n\n470\n00:27:58.145 --> 00:28:00.790\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's a very good way to put it.\n\n471\n00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.443\n>> It doesn't fix anything.\n\n472\n00:28:02.443 --> 00:28:03.580\n[LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n473\n00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.800\ndon't think just because of\nthe application that you've got,\n\n474\n00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.990\nif it works in a small environment and\neverything's there,\n\n475\n00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:16.420\nyou need to make sure those things\nare going to scale up and it can handle.\n\n476\n00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.240\nSome of these products that work,\nand applications that work,\n\n477\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:24.200\nin a small environment are designed just\nfor that, to work in a small environment.\n\n478\n00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.240\nThey weren't designed to\nscale up to these large,\n\n479\n00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.850\nlarge deployments, and\nthey just can't do their job there.\n\n480\n00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.620\nThey weren't effective.\n\n481\n00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.010\n>> And that's a great lead-in to I think\nwhat we were gonna talk about next,\n\n482\n00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.690\npoor planning and poor policy.\n\n483\n00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.470\nIt sounds like they didn't plan at all\nwhen they were rolling out the SMS2, and\n\n484\n00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:46.010\nthey didn't have a policy in place,\nand now they do.\n\n485\n00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.330\nSo maybe they fixed\nsome of their problems,\n\n486\n00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.360\nbut those are things we see often?\n\n487\n00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.812\n>> Yeah, unfortunately you do.\n\n488\n00:28:51.812 --> 00:28:52.611\n>> Unfortunately?\n\n489\n00:28:52.611 --> 00:28:53.780\n[LAUGH]\n>> Definitely,\n\n490\n00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.310\nit's an unfortunate\ncircumstance that you have.\n\n491\n00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:01.830\nI really wanna say that as\nfar as these applications go,\n\n492\n00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:06.750\nin the deployment and security issue, one\nof the big problems we had for years, and\n\n493\n00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:11.755\nthis is kind of to spread\nthe blame around, for example.\n\n494\n00:29:11.755 --> 00:29:16.570\nTo use that SMS 2 example,\none of things, and\n\n495\n00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:22.127\nthis thinking and\nstatement I'm gonna put out here is\n\n496\n00:29:22.127 --> 00:29:27.824\nsomething I got directly\nfrom Microsoft themselves.\n\n497\n00:29:27.824 --> 00:29:33.478\nWhen I did some contracting work up in\nRedmond and was there with their people,\n\n498\n00:29:33.478 --> 00:29:39.047\na good group of people and they're very\nhonest with you, and they're like,\n\n499\n00:29:39.047 --> 00:29:43.780\nyeah, we weren't strong at that before so\nwe kind of fixed that.\n\n500\n00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.630\nThey were addressing things,\nso contrary to popular belief,\n\n501\n00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.720\nyou're like what are they doing,\njust sitting there cashing checks?\n\n502\n00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:54.130\nNo, they are doing stuff up there and they\nare honest with themselves going, yeah.\n\n503\n00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:58.780\nSo that was great to know\nthat because it means that\n\n504\n00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:04.400\nthey're recognizing things, and where\nto put the proper resources in there.\n\n505\n00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.935\nBut one of the things that\nthey they were telling me,\n\n506\n00:30:06.935 --> 00:30:10.555\nbecause they came out\nwith a series of guides.\n\n507\n00:30:10.555 --> 00:30:14.795\nThis was about 6 years ago,\n7 years ago they started coming out with\n\n508\n00:30:14.795 --> 00:30:19.875\nthis whole new series of guides\nthat really didn't exist before and\n\n509\n00:30:19.875 --> 00:30:24.345\nthe guides filled the gap\nbetween here's what\n\n510\n00:30:24.345 --> 00:30:30.290\nthe product does and\nhere's how you set it up.\n\n511\n00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:33.170\nThat was what you had before.\n\n512\n00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:36.500\nThis is the sales stuff,\nthis is this the product you're buying.\n\n513\n00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.310\nIf you get it, this is what it will do.\n\n514\n00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:43.340\nAnd then once you get it, oh good, great,\ncongratulations, here's how you set it up.\n\n515\n00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.960\nThere's a problem there.\n\n516\n00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.460\nThe sale stuff tells you that's what\nit will do once you have it set up and\n\n517\n00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.590\neverything goes all nice and and perfect.\n\n518\n00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:55.393\nThe how to set things up just tell\nyou that, here's how you set it up.\n\n519\n00:30:55.393 --> 00:31:00.074\nThey don't fill in that rift\nbetween here's the features,\n\n520\n00:31:00.074 --> 00:31:05.220\nhow you set them up, and\nhere's what the end result would be.\n\n521\n00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:09.960\nIt's like how do you set them up,\nhow do you make the choice to set up\n\n522\n00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.600\nthose features and know that those\nfeatures or these design choices\n\n523\n00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.840\nare things that are gonna get you\nto where you want to be over here.\n\n524\n00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:24.220\nA lot of times, you had to kind of jump\nacross that rift yourself and figure out\n\n525\n00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:30.390\nwhat this big black hole, what was going\nto go in there, and make things happen.\n\n526\n00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:33.374\nAnd that's where you had a lot of issues.\n\n527\n00:31:33.374 --> 00:31:36.709\nYou had a lot of third party guides\nthat tried to kind of go all\n\n528\n00:31:36.709 --> 00:31:38.113\ndifferent directions,\n\n529\n00:31:38.113 --> 00:31:43.190\nyou had just all sorts of various things,\nlike some of these third party guides.\n\n530\n00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.690\nYou had people that would use it off\ntheir own experience, which is great.\n\n531\n00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:51.130\nAnd then you had the good old school\nof trial and error, or hard knocks,\n\n532\n00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:55.536\nwhere you kind of do something,\nget a shock, don't do that again.\n\n533\n00:31:55.536 --> 00:31:57.929\n>> [LAUGH] There was that.\n\n534\n00:31:57.929 --> 00:32:01.900\nI could say with SMS2,\nin that particular deployment,\n\n535\n00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.010\nthere was a certain\ndegree of that going on.\n\n536\n00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.428\nIt was, here's the case studies and\n\n537\n00:32:07.428 --> 00:32:11.718\nstuff that Microsoft puts out in\nthere ad slicks and everything,\n\n538\n00:32:11.718 --> 00:32:16.481\nand then here is the classes and the\ntraining and books on how to set it up.\n\n539\n00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:19.622\nAnd then nothing to tell you,\nhey now that you know how to set it up and\n\n540\n00:32:19.622 --> 00:32:23.318\nknow what the features can do, here's how\nyou make a choice of which features to\n\n541\n00:32:23.318 --> 00:32:25.820\npull out of the toolbox and\ndeploy over here.\n\n542\n00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.050\nJust kind of how the design\nprocesses is driven.\n\n543\n00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.088\nGot to be much better at that.\n\n544\n00:32:31.088 --> 00:32:36.720\nAnd the great thing for us is that helps\nus accelerate our design process and\n\n545\n00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.240\nplan things out, which is a much better\nway, with a much clearer picture.\n\n546\n00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.890\nAnd help us decide these\nare the features we need, and\n\n547\n00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.015\naddress the issues that you just\nplain didn't think of before.\n\n548\n00:32:47.015 --> 00:32:50.630\nSo that's a great thing that's happening.\n\n549\n00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.410\nMicrosoft's doing it, plus other\ncompanies are doing it now, too,\n\n550\n00:32:55.410 --> 00:33:00.250\nas there's more material that\nfills in that gap of saying, okay,\n\n551\n00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:03.390\nhere's what the product can do, here's\nsome of the customers that are using it\n\n552\n00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:07.660\nthat are getting these results, and\nlet's hear some guides that will tell you\n\n553\n00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.520\nhow to determine what the best solution\nis for your specific situation.\n\n554\n00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.350\nDon't try to get over here because that's\nthem, let's get something that works for\n\n555\n00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.340\nyou based off of what our product does.\n\n556\n00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:17.930\n>> Very good, all right.\n\n557\n00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:20.970\nWell, a lot of great information\non securing applications.\n\n558\n00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.760\nWe've got more to talk about\nwith applications, but\n\n559\n00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.580\nlooking at the clock we're out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n560\n00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:30.200\nSo signing off for\nITPro.TV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n561\n00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.740\n>> And I'm Sean Reano.\n\n562\n00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.620\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

00:00:14.080\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.580\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.620\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.040\n>> Doing pretty good, how are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.680\n>> Fantastic,\nexcited because we've got another episode\n\n8\n00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.440\nin our Comp T Advance Security Practice\ncoming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.690\nIn this one we're going to continue\nour look at hardening applications and\n\n10\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.280\nwe're going to take a look at\nsome specific application issues.\n\n11\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.840\nThat we have to deal with out there.\n\n12\n00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.931\nAnd Sean, there's a few of them.\n\n13\n00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:34.880\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n14\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.870\nthis is by no means an exhaustive list.\n\n15\n00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.650\nSo, you know, keep that in mind.\n\n16\n00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.100\nI mean we could never, even if they\nallocate us all the time we wanted,\n\n17\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.040\nwe're never going to get through them all.\n\n18\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.887\nSo that's just to give you some kind\nof some, the idea of we're going.\n\n19\n00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:55.339\nAnd some of the, we're going to\ngive some of the highlights and\n\n20\n00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.989\nspecifically stuff we're talking\nabout here to be quite honest,\n\n21\n00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.486\nwe've avoided really just saying,\nhey we're teaching specifically you know,\n\n22\n00:01:03.486 --> 00:01:06.640\nwhat's going to be in the exam and\nstuff like that.\n\n23\n00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.130\nIt's not what we're about.\n\n24\n00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.700\nBut the stuff here,\nthe ones that are chosen off this list,\n\n25\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.970\nare the ones that are going\nto be addressed in\n\n26\n00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.490\npart of this body of knowledge, but you\nknow, generally you like to say okay yeah,\n\n27\n00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.740\nthese are the things, and there's a whole\nother big wide world out there too.\n\n28\n00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.470\nSo you're going beyond the exam,\nbut these are ones in this case,\n\n29\n00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.760\nthat we can't [LAUGH] really do that.\n\n30\n00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.040\nWe'd be here forever.\n\n31\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.650\nSo yeah,\nthat's just kind of to kind of you know,\n\n32\n00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.630\nto focus your thinking\non this specific one.\n\n33\n00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.660\n>> Oh, I don't have anywhere to be for\nthe next ten years.\n\n34\n00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.162\nSean, what's the hold up?\n\n35\n00:01:41.162 --> 00:01:43.910\n>> [LAUGH] You guys don't\nmind staying tuned in, right?\n\n36\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.905\nWe're gonna do our own telethon and\njust keep this thing going.\n\n37\n00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:48.620\nEveryone's has got beards down to here.\n\n38\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.490\n>> Yeah [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah there's, there's allot of them.\n\n39\n00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.420\nWhere do you,\nwhere do you even start with, these?\n\n40\n00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.910\n>> Yeah.\nYou know there's no real specific place I,\n\n41\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.890\nI could pick out to start on this and\nso, you know,\n\n42\n00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.540\nI just kind of as, the ones I've got here\non the list are the ones that are just,\n\n43\n00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.010\nlike I said, these are the ones that are,\ntend to be the highlights,\n\n44\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.751\nor some of the bigger issues,\nas far as Comp TSI looks at it.\n\n45\n00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:20.250\nYou know, if you step outside, something\nlike the Casp, I mean you could start\n\n46\n00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.140\nfrom many different points, it all depends\non what you're specifically looking for.\n\n47\n00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.790\nI mean you could find problems\nwith a specific feature,\n\n48\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.220\nyou can find stuff specific to a mobile\ndevice, you can find specific to\n\n49\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.600\na desktop, you know and all sorts\nof things can start this journey.\n\n50\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.330\nThe ones that they have\nkind of focused on here,\n\n51\n00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.340\nfrom the Comp TSI, are things that are\nreally kind of the web based type stuff.\n\n52\n00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.160\nThey've just chosen that.\n\n53\n00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.300\nAnd so some of the stuff\nhere isn't just web stuff,\n\n54\n00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.439\nbut a lot of is isn't\nspecifically in that area, so\n\n55\n00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:01.390\njust to kind of put that in\nthe proper frame of reference.\n\n56\n00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.859\n>> All right, so, what in our unordered\nlist then where do we start [LAUGH].\n\n57\n00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.930\n>> [LAUGH] Okay now that's a better way,\nso\n\n58\n00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.174\nsome of the ones that we have for\nexample, cross site scripting.\n\n59\n00:03:12.174 --> 00:03:16.230\nCross site scripting\nit's not something that's\n\n60\n00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.220\nnew to us talking about the way\nany of the courses we've done and\n\n61\n00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.430\nI'm sure that a lot of you have\nalready heard about this, and\n\n62\n00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.930\nmaybe not encountered it specifically, but\nyou've heard about cross site scripting.\n\n63\n00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.510\nSo really what is you know, cross site\nscripting and why is it such a bad thing.\n\n64\n00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.490\nWell, cross site scripting, what makes\nit bad, is the fact that someone can\n\n65\n00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.030\nconstruct a URL and send that to you,\nand have you go to one location,\n\n66\n00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.740\nwhile at the same time executing\ncode from another location.\n\n67\n00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.860\nAnd so the problem there is\nthat you're going to one place,\n\n68\n00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.820\nand when you run this code\nfrom this other place,\n\n69\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.560\nthat code may be coming from\na place that you don't trust.\n\n70\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.350\nAnd it's just piggybacking on the trust\nyou have with the primary site.\n\n71\n00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.500\nAnd that code, when it runs, could be\nyou know, cherry picking or looking for\n\n72\n00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.320\nspecific pieces of information that\ncould be useful to an attacker.\n\n73\n00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.880\nIt could not only steal\nthings like cookies and\n\n74\n00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.950\npersonal data and\ninstall stuff on a system.\n\n75\n00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.580\nIt could even be doing stuff\nlike stealing session ID's and\n\n76\n00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.140\nstuff like that to set them up to\ndo a session hijacking against you.\n\n77\n00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.700\n>> Well that doesn't sounds good.\n\n78\n00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.584\n>> Yeah that definitely is\nnot a good thing at all.\n\n79\n00:04:35.584 --> 00:04:38.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, it's been around for ages and\n\n80\n00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.590\nthat's the thing.\n\n81\n00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.930\nIt's not a problem that seems to be\njust disappearing and going away.\n\n82\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.160\nIt's something that is there,\nand absolutely it still happens.\n\n83\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.960\nAnd the browser manufacturers and\nthe people that make web applications and\n\n84\n00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.880\nthe web servers and all that,\nthey have done a lot of things to kind of\n\n85\n00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.000\nstem the tide of this,\nbut It's still there.\n\n86\n00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.100\nIt's still a very real threat.\n\n87\n00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.880\nIt is something that you\nwill encounter and so\n\n88\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.450\nyou need to you know, kind of,\nkeep in mind when you do this.\n\n89\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.830\nIt's not something that when you\nheard about it 15 years ago,\n\n90\n00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.290\nwhich you could go back 15 years ago and\nstill hear about it.\n\n91\n00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.070\nIt's pretty much the same issue.\n\n92\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.700\nIt's just what they're doing\nwith it may have changed.\n\n93\n00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.494\nBut the specifically the situation still,\nit does the same type,\n\n94\n00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:32.560\nit does the same overall, so\nthey can adapt it to certain situations.\n\n95\n00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.300\n>> Is it something that I deal with\nas a web admin on my web server or\n\n96\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.490\nis it something that the client\nhas to worry about, and\n\n97\n00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.840\nthat they can protect themselves from it?\n\n98\n00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.330\nWhere does that fall in?\n\n99\n00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.185\n>> You know, it's both.\n\n100\n00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:46.680\n>> Yeah.\n>> It really is both sides of it.\n\n101\n00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.080\nBrowsers, they have put\na lot of patches in place.\n\n102\n00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.270\nIf you go through and look at\nthe different versions of browsers and\n\n103\n00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.850\nupdates that come out.\n\n104\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.644\nThere's quite a few over\nthe years that have said, and\n\n105\n00:05:56.644 --> 00:05:58.660\nthis fix is a cross side scripting bug.\n\n106\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.730\nAnd they'll usually say something\nlike it's a cross site scripting.\n\n107\n00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.970\nThey'll do something like XSS.\n\n108\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.360\nThat's the shorthand for\ncross site scripting.\n\n109\n00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.010\nSo you do see that in the browser side,\nwhich is one of the reasons why you wanna\n\n110\n00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.060\nbe upgrading your browser and\nstay on top of that.\n\n111\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.347\nI'm not saying always go bleeding edge,\nthat's up to you if you want to do that,\n\n112\n00:06:20.347 --> 00:06:25.720\nbut you know, keep it modern, you mean\nyou shouldn't be running like some\n\n113\n00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.380\npeople are still running you know IE 6 you\nknow there's really no excuse for that.\n\n114\n00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.575\n>> You looked at my computer again.\n\n115\n00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:34.970\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, knock it off all right,\n\n116\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.270\nit's you still see people running that and\nthey.\n\n117\n00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.610\nThere's all sorts of wrong with that, but\npeople are still running that in certain\n\n118\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.590\nsituations, they're just like, hey,\nthis works for me, I'm not upgrading,\n\n119\n00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.740\nI've even heard the excuse out there with,\nfor example that version, the browser.\n\n120\n00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.740\nAnd this is unique to that browser.\n\n121\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.560\nBut I've heard it saying, well our\ndevelopers wrote code you know, for\n\n122\n00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.440\nthat and they haven't written any code for\nthe newer browser, so we have\n\n123\n00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.342\nto use Zilla for this application to work\nit's like well, you know developers?\n\n124\n00:07:11.342 --> 00:07:11.870\n>> All developers?\n\n125\n00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.400\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.520\n>> That's kind of where I'm going,\n\n127\n00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.530\nyou know, with that.\n\n128\n00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.410\nIt's like, you know,\nI know developments a though,\n\n129\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.640\na doing application developments and\ncoding is a tough job.\n\n130\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.710\nI would never take away from it.\n\n131\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.090\nIt's one that you know,\nI am myself am incapable of doing,\n\n132\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.460\nyou know I know that so I respect that,\nknow a lot of people in that area, but\n\n133\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.560\nquite frankly your developers can't, are\nthat far behind, can't keep up with it.\n\n134\n00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.600\nFire them and get new ones.\n\n135\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's just my bottom line with that.\n\n136\n00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.820\nThat's, I can accept, you know,\nmaybe your release behind,\n\n137\n00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.700\nmaybe even two instances behind,\nbut how far back is six?\n\n138\n00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.770\nIt's, that's the, you're talking\nancient history at that point.\n\n139\n00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.400\nThere's no excuse for that.\n\n140\n00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.810\n>> And then, you've got click jacking.\n\n141\n00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.200\nThat's an interesting one.\n\n142\n00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.378\n>> Yeah, click jacking is a really,\nreally fascinating one.\n\n143\n00:07:56.378 --> 00:08:01.464\nIt's where, it's kind of like I\nlook at the same category as a.\n\n144\n00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:02.925\nAs like Click Bait.\n\n145\n00:08:02.925 --> 00:08:07.965\nYou click on something, they take it,\nand they take you someplace else and\n\n146\n00:08:07.965 --> 00:08:11.940\nredirect you all over the web and\nback doing things.\n\n147\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.490\nThat's a technique they use.\n\n148\n00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:18.553\nThe ad companies\n\n149\n00:08:18.553 --> 00:08:25.460\nuse that and website owners will use that.\n\n150\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.140\nAs a way to increase their revenues and\n\n151\n00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:34.013\nto get you to do whatever but\nThere could be a nasty side\n\n152\n00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:36.860\nto this too they could redirect\nyou to some place that.\n\n153\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.960\nYou don't wanna go.\n\n154\n00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.040\nIt's not a place that you would\ngo under normal conditions,\n\n155\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.150\nbut you click on and all of a sudden\nit shoves you someplace where it's\n\n156\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.960\ngot some nasty things lurking on it.\n\n157\n00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.660\nAnd that could be a case where you click\non something, it sends you someplace and\n\n158\n00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.430\nit makes you think that it's okay and\nit looks interesting.\n\n159\n00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.090\nBut the site you go to does\ndrive by downloads and\n\n160\n00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.746\nshoves a bunch of stuff on your system\nbefore you have any time to stop it.\n\n161\n00:09:04.746 --> 00:09:07.780\n>> I swear those guys have their\ntiming down so well you're waiting for\n\n162\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.300\na page to load and you click on a link you\nwanna click, but the page is still loading\n\n163\n00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.700\nand then as soon it loads their\nad slides down into place and\n\n164\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.270\ncovers up the where you were clicking and\nnow you just clicked on that ad and\n\n165\n00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.760\nyou're going somewhere else you\nhad no intention of going to.\n\n166\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.610\n>> Yeah, once they've got you,\nenticed you to clicking on that link,\n\n167\n00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.190\nthey can do a lot of things at that point.\n\n168\n00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.760\nThey can really do stuff\nto own that browser and\n\n169\n00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.690\nthat system if they want to go that\nfar and you're vulnerable to that and\n\n170\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.620\nremember it's not too difficult to\ncraft some of the vulnerabilities.\n\n171\n00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.630\nWe saw when we went through our\nwhole stuff with Metasploit and\n\n172\n00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:54.400\none portion of it was cuz\nMetasploit has multiple heads and\n\n173\n00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.560\nstuff that you can use\nto get it to attack.\n\n174\n00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.530\nAnd we had stuff where we\ncould fire exploits and\n\n175\n00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:05.410\ntake advantage of vulnerabilities on\na system to push something on to it, and\n\n176\n00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.800\nthen do our nasty business.\n\n177\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.720\nBut what happens if you have a system that\nit's not possible to run a remote code on,\n\n178\n00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.530\nor it's very, very tough, or\nyou don't have an exploit to leverage it.\n\n179\n00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.560\nWell you have that social\nengineering tool kit\n\n180\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:26.300\nthat you can create\nauthentic looking emails\n\n181\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.155\nthat have links embedded into and\nso click on that, and you can do,\n\n182\n00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:35.435\ncross site scripting or you can do click\njacking plus a couple other things.\n\n183\n00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:40.325\nAnd one of the things I can do with click\njacking is cause you to click on a link in\n\n184\n00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:45.570\nan email and they have in the social\nengineer toolkit, they have several things\n\n185\n00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:51.700\nagainst Flash and so how many systems\nyou know that actually run Flash.\n\n186\n00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.890\nIt's probably almost all of them.\n\n187\n00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.890\nIt seems like almost all of them.\n\n188\n00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.035\nSo they've sharpened\ntheir knives on that one.\n\n189\n00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:03.550\nAnd said yeah we got you,\nyou just gotta pick it off the list,\n\n190\n00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.980\nand say craft an email on it, fire it out,\nor you know you could take that link,\n\n191\n00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.840\nembed it in a website and entice people\nto go there and do a drive by download on\n\n192\n00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:18.015\nthem and it pushes a A RAT, you know,\nremote access Trojan, on their system and\n\n193\n00:11:18.015 --> 00:11:22.955\nyou've got control of a system now,\nor way to control a system now.\n\n194\n00:11:22.955 --> 00:11:25.755\n>> And that click jacking sounds like\nit leads right into our next one,\n\n195\n00:11:25.755 --> 00:11:29.275\nwhich was session management, because if\nthey can get us to click on something,\n\n196\n00:11:29.275 --> 00:11:32.855\nthat's half the battle in trying\nto take over our system, right?\n\n197\n00:11:32.855 --> 00:11:36.855\n>> Yeah, that is a really one of\nthe places where this could head.\n\n198\n00:11:36.855 --> 00:11:39.410\nYou could be going right down that road.\n\n199\n00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.220\nSession management is kind\nof the good guy term for it.\n\n200\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.120\nThat's what the developers will use.\n\n201\n00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.730\nIs that when they create\na session they will do,\n\n202\n00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.030\nyou're hoping that the right things\nare done to create secure session ID's and\n\n203\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.140\nto make sure that those all taken care of.\n\n204\n00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.020\nAnd they're not easily predictable.\n\n205\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.230\nThat there's a good degree\nof entropy in them.\n\n206\n00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.760\nStuff like that However,\nif that's not done,\n\n207\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.100\nthen that leads you to the other\nterm that floats around,\n\n208\n00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.440\nsession management, which is session\nhijacking, which is where someone can grab\n\n209\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.090\nthose session IDs that are being generated\nand aren't being managed correctly.\n\n210\n00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:23.870\nThey can grab them and they can see if\ntheir first of all if their predictable,\n\n211\n00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.540\nif their predictable they\ncan create their own,\n\n212\n00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.730\nthey can just forge their own that\nfollows the standard and get in they\n\n213\n00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.790\ncould do a cross site and\ngrabbed your session ID that's unique\n\n214\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:41.280\nto you and use that as a way to get\nin as you and then do the dirty work.\n\n215\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.260\nThen there's a whole bunch of other\nthings that they could do to grab those\n\n216\n00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.220\nsession ID These.\n\n217\n00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.710\nIf they're easily readable,\nlike I said, predictable,\n\n218\n00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.350\nany of those things like that,\nthey could do a session hijack\n\n219\n00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:00.460\nby session management not\nbeing performed correctly.\n\n220\n00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:05.020\nNow, the thing about this is that when\nyou talk about session hijacking,\n\n221\n00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.110\nyou've got the web side and\n\n222\n00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.970\nyou've got the network side, so\nyou can do it at those two levels.\n\n223\n00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.970\nAs far as the network side, we won't\nreally worry about that right now,\n\n224\n00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.450\ncuz that's not really something we\nwanna bring into the discussion.\n\n225\n00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.400\nJust to make sure that you know that\nthere's two different levels on that.\n\n226\n00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.550\nNow When we kick out the network side and\n\n227\n00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.930\nwe look at the application side with\nthe session IDs and web applications,\n\n228\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:31.970\nwhich is all the stuff they were just\ntalking about that it refers to.\n\n229\n00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.530\nTools that we have to do that,\nplenty of them.\n\n230\n00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:39.920\nYou can use the raw tools,\nstuff like Wireshark\n\n231\n00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.090\nwould help you out with this, you could\nsniff session IDs and stuff like that.\n\n232\n00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:49.170\nBut then you've got tools that I wanted\nto make sure I mentioned these in here so\n\n233\n00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.620\nyou could be aware of them.\n\n234\n00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.460\nYou test them,\nyou test them at your own risk so\n\n235\n00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.100\nI'm telling you to you\nknow be careful with that.\n\n236\n00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.330\nThey are out there.\n\n237\n00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:02.216\nThey are dangerous and\njust having them on your system will cause\n\n238\n00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:05.995\na lot of anti-malware\nsystems to freak out.\n\n239\n00:14:05.995 --> 00:14:08.445\nThey will just go hey, whoa,\nwhat are you doing here?\n\n240\n00:14:08.445 --> 00:14:10.285\nWhat are you installing this here for?\n\n241\n00:14:10.285 --> 00:14:15.682\nSo one of the ones that help you out that\nhelps you out with this is something\n\n242\n00:14:15.682 --> 00:14:16.792\nlike Fire Sheep.\n\n243\n00:14:16.792 --> 00:14:20.072\nIt's not,\nit's by no means something that's new.\n\n244\n00:14:20.072 --> 00:14:25.341\nIt's been around for a while it\nactually initially got into Into\n\n245\n00:14:25.341 --> 00:14:31.201\nsomething like Mozilla's AP store and\na few other ones.\n\n246\n00:14:31.201 --> 00:14:33.591\nIt was there before, like whoa,\n\n247\n00:14:33.591 --> 00:14:38.501\nthat's an evil application, let's rip\nit out of there and get rid of it.\n\n248\n00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:41.691\nIt's still available so\ndon't just think that you're gonna,\n\n249\n00:14:41.691 --> 00:14:45.151\nif you go through some of these\nthings like Mozilla shop or whatever.\n\n250\n00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:48.039\nIf it's not there, you're out of luck.\n\n251\n00:14:48.039 --> 00:14:49.050\nNo, it's still out there.\n\n252\n00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.750\nJust means that you're gonna have to go\nhunt it down, find it, make sure you're\n\n253\n00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.900\ngetting it from a legit source, which the\ndeveloper of it still has their site up.\n\n254\n00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.730\nAnd then you're gonna have\nto install it yourself.\n\n255\n00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:04.570\nAnd you may get some warnings,\nboth from your anti-malware system plus\n\n256\n00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:09.340\nyou know plus the browser might say\nhey wait a minute this isn't something\n\n257\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.220\nthat's on the level but if you've got\nit from a legitimate source and you're\n\n258\n00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.810\non a system that you're testing it on is\nsafe or if you have good confidence in it.\n\n259\n00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.020\nThen you can install it,\n\n260\n00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.010\npretty much without concern if\nyou've done your due diligence.\n\n261\n00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.810\nIf you get Fire Sheep on your system,\n\n262\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:29.520\nwhat it's designed to do, is it's designed\nto grab stuff like Facebook credentials.\n\n263\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.160\nIt can do that.\nIt can grab the session ID's and\n\n264\n00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.330\nstuff like that.\n\n265\n00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:36.580\nAnd we used to do some\nnasty business with that.\n\n266\n00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.270\nSo that's one,\nthat was actually probably as far as\n\n267\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.680\nprepackaged shrink-wrap type\nof applications to do this,\n\n268\n00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.390\nthat was probably the first one\nthat we really caught out there.\n\n269\n00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.574\nBut then they've stepped up their game.\n\n270\n00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:53.251\nAnd you, the people that have developed\nthis type of stuff not the guy that\n\n271\n00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:54.451\ndeveloped firesheet.\n\n272\n00:15:54.451 --> 00:15:58.188\nBut collectively the people that\ndevelop this type of stuff have moved\n\n273\n00:15:58.188 --> 00:16:01.753\nthat over to Other platforms,\nfiresheet runs across platforms.\n\n274\n00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:05.405\nBut you also have things like for\nthe Android platform,\n\n275\n00:16:05.405 --> 00:16:09.521\nyou have one called DroidSheep,\nwhich you can run and it will,\n\n276\n00:16:09.521 --> 00:16:13.560\nit's a sniffer, but\nit's designed to look specifically for\n\n277\n00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.627\ncredentials and session ID's and\ndisplay them for you, so you can use them.\n\n278\n00:16:18.627 --> 00:16:22.036\nAnd then they even got a really\nnasty one and you can kind of tell,\n\n279\n00:16:22.036 --> 00:16:23.120\nfrom the name of it.\n\n280\n00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.820\nThey've got one called face sniff\nthat's designed specifically for\n\n281\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.080\nthe android platform.\n\n282\n00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.187\nI think you can get it for IOS too,\nand it's designed to stiff\n\n283\n00:16:31.187 --> 00:16:35.390\nthe credentials of relating\nspecifically to Facebook for that.\n\n284\n00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.390\nAnd those are really kind\nof like the top three.\n\n285\n00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:41.110\nThere's other ones that\nare kind of competing for\n\n286\n00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:46.470\nthat title of nasty,\nvicious tool for session hijacking.\n\n287\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.840\n>> All right, and\n\n288\n00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.950\nthen geotagging is another one that\nwe've discussed a couple of times.\n\n289\n00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:55.150\n>> Yeah, geotagging, it's something that\n\n290\n00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:03.200\nunlike some of the stuff that we've talked\nabout, it's a double edged sword really,\n\n291\n00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.300\nbecause it's something\nthat is great to have\n\n292\n00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:14.680\nby some standards, and by other standards,\nit can be used against you.\n\n293\n00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:20.990\n>> So don't think of it necessarily as a\nbad thing, think of it as something that,\n\n294\n00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.790\nit's got the the possibilities to\ngo either way, it just depends.\n\n295\n00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:29.510\nSo what geotagging does, if you\nhaven't had the long spiel on that or\n\n296\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.360\nhaven't heard it before,\nis geotagging, it actually says,\n\n297\n00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.670\nwell you can have when you\ncreate a piece of content,\n\n298\n00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:46.660\nin this case it's an image, when you\ncreate an image, it has a XIF data on it.\n\n299\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.440\nSo what that XIF data\ndoes is the XIF data and\n\n300\n00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.360\nI'm going to kind of show you stuff here\non it, but XIF data is something that is\n\n301\n00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:02.680\ntagged on an image that tells you,\nokay this is where that image was taken.\n\n302\n00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.710\nThis is the camera, this is the time,\nthis is the date, and\n\n303\n00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:10.700\nit's not necessarily a bad\nthing having that, because hey,\n\n304\n00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.500\nyou may want to have that because you\ntake a picture with your camera or\n\n305\n00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.410\nyour cell phone or whatever,\nsomething with GPS enabled.\n\n306\n00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.660\nIt makes it really easy for\nyou to tie back to where it is.\n\n307\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.440\nI mean, one of areas I think\nthat this is incredibly helpful,\n\n308\n00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.990\nis one of the things that I participated\nin is doing search and rescue.\n\n309\n00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.130\nAnd when you're doing arial\nphotography in the old days,\n\n310\n00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:39.540\nyou had to have the guy pick out the map\nand the quadrant you are in the map.\n\n311\n00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.630\nYou had a guy in there that was\nkeeping track of where you are, and\n\n312\n00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.460\nhe'll give you the close coordinates.\n\n313\n00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.290\nSomeone will go out and find it.\n\n314\n00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:51.986\nWell, now if I have a camera or a device\nthat's GPS enabled, I'm taking pictures,\n\n315\n00:18:51.986 --> 00:18:54.590\nI don't have to ask for that information.\n\n316\n00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.570\nI just put the camera up at,\nat, porthole and\n\n317\n00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.190\nclick, it's embedded right in the image.\n\n318\n00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:04.378\nSo if someone, when I go back or\ntransmit that photo back to\n\n319\n00:19:04.378 --> 00:19:10.050\nthe headquarters or the base station,\nthey immediately know where it is.\n\n320\n00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.594\nThey can task another unit with going\nout there to see if that's something\n\n321\n00:19:13.594 --> 00:19:15.548\nthat needs to be investigated further.\n\n322\n00:19:15.548 --> 00:19:16.511\n>> Oh I see.\n\n323\n00:19:16.511 --> 00:19:19.670\n>> So, that would be a positive on it.\n\n324\n00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.940\nThere's plenty of positives, but\nthere's also the dark aspect of it, or\n\n325\n00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.750\nthe potential bad side of it.\n\n326\n00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.860\nAnd that's where you get\nsomething like this.\n\n327\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:34.970\nNow Echosec itself is\nnot a tool that's nasty.\n\n328\n00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.870\nIt's like anything,\nit could be used either way.\n\n329\n00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:44.700\nEchosec, what it will do is it\nrelies on social media postings and\n\n330\n00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.270\nin other things that are tagged with\nthis locational data or somehow or\n\n331\n00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:56.170\nsomeway are able to be tied to a location,\nand it displays that location on a map.\n\n332\n00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:00.110\nSo, you can choose a location and\nthen once you've got that location,\n\n333\n00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.690\nyou can say, \"Okay,\nI've got that location\".\n\n334\n00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:08.230\nAnd draw a box around what you want\nto see and it will display it.\n\n335\n00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:13.420\nWhat I did here, is I just said,\nLas Vegas Strip, and\n\n336\n00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:20.195\nI choose this one because,\njust to make it interesting,\n\n337\n00:20:20.195 --> 00:20:26.440\nbecause I know there's a lot of people, no\nmatter what time of year you're talking.\n\n338\n00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.630\nThere's a lot of people walking up and\ndown in that place,\n\n339\n00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:33.395\ntaking pictures of everything, selfies,\ndoing all sorts of stuff, twittering, and\n\n340\n00:20:33.395 --> 00:20:39.395\neverything else, and so\nsince there's so much of that, I can\n\n341\n00:20:39.395 --> 00:20:44.735\nsee that there's actually a lot of things\nshowing up on this photo right here.\n\n342\n00:20:44.735 --> 00:20:49.305\nYou can see that this is between the last\nfour days it looks like, when you\n\n343\n00:20:49.305 --> 00:20:53.895\nlook at my scale up top, the last four\ndays, I mean look at the number of blips.\n\n344\n00:20:53.895 --> 00:20:58.460\nToday's not even done, and look at the,\nit hasn't even reached noon in\n\n345\n00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.080\nVegas yet, so we're still working on this.\n\n346\n00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:08.008\nAnd you can see over on the left hand\nside, you can see the stuff that\n\n347\n00:21:08.008 --> 00:21:13.790\npeople have posted.\n\n348\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.190\nBe a little bit careful with this.\n\n349\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.300\nBut you know,\nyou can see stuff that people have posted.\n\n350\n00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.742\nI mean, you hover over some of these\nthings, or click on them, it will\n\n351\n00:21:24.742 --> 00:21:30.763\ntell you, it will give you information\non where that was taken, who took it.\n\n352\n00:21:30.763 --> 00:21:34.949\nSo I click on this image right here,\n\n353\n00:21:34.949 --> 00:21:39.285\nthat was July 31st 11:37 am.\n\n354\n00:21:39.285 --> 00:21:45.053\nWell my clock's still set in west coast\ntime, it's 11:41 on west coast, which\n\n355\n00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:50.680\nis what the time zone Vegas is in, so this\nwas taken you know about four minutes ago.\n\n356\n00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:56.480\nSo and I can pinpoint to location\non the map exactly where that is.\n\n357\n00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.290\nIs the person that's taking\nknowing necessarily that this what\n\n358\n00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.930\nthey're doing and broadcasting?\n\n359\n00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.070\nThey probably don't.\n\n360\n00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:11.040\nBecause people leave these settings turned\non in their camera or on their phones,\n\n361\n00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.380\nand they also think of the fact that 'hey,\nthere's all these location services and\n\n362\n00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.560\neverything else that's enabled\nby default in addition to GPS'.\n\n363\n00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.310\nSo you don't have to have your\nGPS turned on to get this.\n\n364\n00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:27.910\nYou can have,\nif it's not tagging it with your GPS, it's\n\n365\n00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:32.640\ntagging it through off of towers and stuff\nlike that and IP addresses and all that.\n\n366\n00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.020\nIt can put that together to get a fairly\naccurate idea of where you are.\n\n367\n00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.230\nAnd so that's what we're kind\nof seeing in here as well.\n\n368\n00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:45.920\nSo kind of a potential concern there.\n\n369\n00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:50.600\nAs far as an application goes,\nwhat something like\n\n370\n00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:56.490\nEchosec does is they just go to those\nvarious services, plug into them,\n\n371\n00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.020\nand when you query something on the map,\nit just extracts that from that.\n\n372\n00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.450\nAll those things are readily\navailable to them.\n\n373\n00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:07.200\nThey're not hacking anything, they're not\nsnooping or prying into any of your stuff.\n\n374\n00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.730\nThey're just showing this is stuff that\nyou've put out there that the application\n\n375\n00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:15.580\nallows you to put out there,\nand if you know about it or\n\n376\n00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.960\nnot, it's being put there if\nyou don't tell it not to.\n\n377\n00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.093\nIn most cases, you have to tell\nit not to put it there, and so\n\n378\n00:23:25.093 --> 00:23:29.562\nyou're just going there,\nclicking away, doing your stuff and\n\n379\n00:23:29.562 --> 00:23:33.866\nthey're able just to readily\nextract this through the API and\n\n380\n00:23:33.866 --> 00:23:37.423\nbring it into here and\ndisplay it for us to browse and\n\n381\n00:23:37.423 --> 00:23:42.009\nlaugh at people on their vacation and\nwhat ever else we want to do.\n\n382\n00:23:42.009 --> 00:23:45.307\nAnd you'd be amazed,\nboth in a good and bad way,\n\n383\n00:23:45.307 --> 00:23:48.209\nabout the stuff that people post on there.\n\n384\n00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:52.797\nAnd think that I'm in my own\npart of the Internet and\n\n385\n00:23:52.797 --> 00:23:59.210\nno one's gonna be able to find it\nbecause there's this big sea of data.\n\n386\n00:23:59.210 --> 00:23:59.740\nYeah.\n\n387\n00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.235\nYou've got another thing coming if that's\nwhat you think that's gonna happen.\n\n388\n00:24:03.235 --> 00:24:09.730\nNotice I didn't just liberally start\nscrolling through this like crazy.\n\n389\n00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.600\nBecause I do not want to\nhave to rerecord this.\n\n390\n00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.910\nI do not want to get yelled at for\nsomething showing up there.\n\n391\n00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.880\nBecause I've had some stuff where\nit scrolled through it when I\n\n392\n00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.320\ntried the stuff out, and\nwe're like eye bleach.\n\n393\n00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.917\nGet that out of here.\n\n394\n00:24:23.917 --> 00:24:27.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I wanted to gouge my eyes out.\n\n395\n00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.470\nAnd some of these things people you can\ntell they thought well no one's ever going\n\n396\n00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:31.090\nto find it.\n\n397\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.130\nWell someone's gonna find it.\n\n398\n00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.132\n>> Absolutely.\n\n399\n00:24:34.132 --> 00:24:38.910\nAnd then input validation is another\nbig one that we've got to deal with.\n\n400\n00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:42.875\n>> Yeah so we don't need to worry about\nthe geo tagging, so that's one with that.\n\n401\n00:24:42.875 --> 00:24:45.895\nWe have other things that\ncan cause nastiness, and\n\n402\n00:24:45.895 --> 00:24:48.495\none of them is input validation.\n\n403\n00:24:48.495 --> 00:24:50.055\nInput validation is just like it sounds.\n\n404\n00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:52.425\nIt's you put something\ninto an application and\n\n405\n00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:55.305\nthere's a mechanism to validate\nthat it was in the correct format.\n\n406\n00:24:55.305 --> 00:24:57.845\nOkay, that's easy enough, right?\n\n407\n00:24:57.845 --> 00:24:59.235\nIt's straightforward.\n\n408\n00:24:59.235 --> 00:25:01.995\nIt seems like there's nothing\nreally more to add to that.\n\n409\n00:25:01.995 --> 00:25:03.465\nThere is more to add to that.\n\n410\n00:25:03.465 --> 00:25:09.340\nWhat we have to add onto that is the fact\nthat when you do input validation or\n\n411\n00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:14.320\na lack of input validation it leads\nto other stuff that could be big,\n\n412\n00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.314\nnasty things for you to have to deal with.\n\n413\n00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:20.234\nFor example, SQL injections.\n\n414\n00:25:20.234 --> 00:25:22.930\nSQL injections.\n\n415\n00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:27.860\nThey are largely enabled by having\na lack of input validation or\n\n416\n00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.590\npoor input validation.\n\n417\n00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:33.290\nAnd so if you are doing it correctly and\n\n418\n00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.380\nsomeone can monkey around\nwith fields on a form.\n\n419\n00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:41.080\nThey can construct queries right through\nthat form that you kindly provided them,\n\n420\n00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.660\nand start getting information out of that.\n\n421\n00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:45.740\nThat's like design 101.\n\n422\n00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.720\nI would think with design applications\nthey would tell you, hey, if you put\n\n423\n00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:54.520\na form out there, don't you have an idea\nof what type of information you want back?\n\n424\n00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:59.350\nIf you do, then you put restrictions\non it to make sure it's only that, so\n\n425\n00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:04.940\npeople can't do all this nastiness\nwith it or do it as easily as we see.\n\n426\n00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.920\nThere's that, then there's even\nthe unexpected outside of SQLl injection.\n\n427\n00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.930\nThere's even something\na technique called fuzzing.\n\n428\n00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:17.330\nAnd what fuzzing does it feed\nranges of values to something.\n\n429\n00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.860\nAnd you can tell there's\nactually utilities that do this.\n\n430\n00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.660\nYou can feed it ranges of value and\nsee how the application reacts.\n\n431\n00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:31.840\nAnd then based on how it reacts\nyou can determine if there's\n\n432\n00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.960\nsomething you have to do to shore\nup the application or fix it.\n\n433\n00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:42.040\nFuzzing can reveal some very\ninteresting results that\n\n434\n00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:47.020\nyou would not expect because you may not\ntry these weird combinations of things.\n\n435\n00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:51.230\nAnd I can tell you from working\nin the area of testing software\n\n436\n00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:56.190\napplications as one of my job\nresponsibilities years ago,\n\n437\n00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.645\nthe stuff that before\nfuzzy became a thing.\n\n438\n00:26:59.645 --> 00:27:04.735\nPeople were doing the crude,\nbrute force version of fuzzing.\n\n439\n00:27:04.735 --> 00:27:10.085\nI remember I worked with people in Japan,\nand I don't know what it is about\n\n440\n00:27:10.085 --> 00:27:14.835\nthe Japanese, they were very good at this,\nthey had some extra sense or whatever\n\n441\n00:27:14.835 --> 00:27:19.243\nto be able to do this, because the people\nwe worked with over there, they were\n\n442\n00:27:19.243 --> 00:27:23.255\nconstantly sending us stuff, it's like,\noh well do this and watch what comes out.\n\n443\n00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.710\nWhat possessed you to do that?\n\n444\n00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.230\nThat was what came to mind.\n\n445\n00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:30.870\nWhat possessed you to do that?\n\n446\n00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:32.870\nI'm not saying that this\nisn't a good catch,\n\n447\n00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:36.740\nbut we have a lot of brain power over\nhere that never thought of that.\n\n448\n00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.620\nYou did that on your own, so\nyou've got to tell us what the secret is.\n\n449\n00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:40.265\n>> It was my cat.\n\n450\n00:27:40.265 --> 00:27:41.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n451\n00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.460\nthey just put it on the keyboard and\nstomp around.\n\n452\n00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.140\nThey come up with this thing.\n\n453\n00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:47.700\nWhat did you?\n\n454\n00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.750\nWhat are you doing?\n\n455\n00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:54.800\nSome of the results that they\nwould get just by punching\n\n456\n00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:00.090\nin some stuff that was\nnot entirely random but\n\n457\n00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:07.060\nthat someone could easily put\nthat in just by accident.\n\n458\n00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.290\nBut it probably unlikely.\n\n459\n00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:13.010\nIt would open doors and show you,\noh well, that's apt to actually happen.\n\n460\n00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:14.430\nLet me open up a code, wait a minute,\n\n461\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.390\nthere's something else in\nhere that can be done.\n\n462\n00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:20.820\nLet me fix that code before any\nof these other bad things happen.\n\n463\n00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.950\nWhich may be more likely,\nso that was a good thing.\n\n464\n00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:29.572\nBut yeah, I swear it still sticks\nwith me that my Japanese friends over\n\n465\n00:28:29.572 --> 00:28:35.408\nthere that they were able to just,\nit was like a magical ability I swear.\n\n466\n00:28:35.408 --> 00:28:39.249\nThey had like divining rods or something\ndoing that because there had to be some\n\n467\n00:28:39.249 --> 00:28:42.344\nmystical power going on that I\ndon't know about that they had.\n\n468\n00:28:42.344 --> 00:28:44.694\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right well Sean,\n\n469\n00:28:44.694 --> 00:28:46.944\ntell you what there was a lot\nof great information on.\n\n470\n00:28:46.944 --> 00:28:50.423\nAgain, more application, in this case,\nspecific application issues that we've\n\n471\n00:28:50.423 --> 00:28:53.620\ngotta deal with, that we've gotta be\nable to protect our networks against.\n\n472\n00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.190\nAnd we've gotta think about\nwhen we're designing a good,\n\n473\n00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:01.040\nsecure network and machines and\nthe application that are running on those.\n\n474\n00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.840\nAnything else you wanna throw in\nhere before we wrap this one up?\n\n475\n00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:10.400\n>> No, I think we covered a pretty airly\n\n476\n00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.410\ndecent range of things that can\nhappen in web applications.\n\n477\n00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:14.990\nLike I said,\n\n478\n00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.440\ndo not think that it's on that strictly\nlimited to what you have here.\n\n479\n00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:25.290\nThese just happen to be the things\nthat CompTL likes to hit on but\n\n480\n00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:28.760\nthere's plenty of other ones so\nI don't want you to take away from this\n\n481\n00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.390\nthat if you're someone that's watching\nthis and as a web developer and\n\n482\n00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:35.780\nyou're Shawn and\nMike just missed an opportunity\n\n483\n00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.190\nto talk about a whole nuch of other\nnasty ones out there that happened.\n\n484\n00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.440\nWell, we're well aware,\nfirst of all we're not developers,\n\n485\n00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.300\nwe're not trying to work\non it at that level.\n\n486\n00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.110\nSecond of all, there's only so\n\n487\n00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:49.720\nmany that can be tested on to make\nsure you have an awareness of it, and\n\n488\n00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.200\nthese things actually make you aware\nof some of the things that can happen.\n\n489\n00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.390\nAnd hopefully when you're doing your\ntesting and planning, and doing\n\n490\n00:29:56.390 --> 00:30:00.710\nyour design as a CASP, as that management\nperson, this has opened your eyes.\n\n491\n00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:06.320\nIt's like I'd better take a closer look at\nthis stuff because I know there's this and\n\n492\n00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.330\nthere's probably other stuff,\nand you'd be right.\n\n493\n00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:10.010\nYou just have to do your research.\n\n494\n00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.880\n>> All right, good.\n\n495\n00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.670\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n496\n00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.870\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n497\n00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.803\n>> And I'm Shean

Rodrick.\n\n3\n00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.221\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:17.420\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.780\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.520\n>> I'm doing great, excited to be here.\n\n7\n00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.260\nWe got another of our CompTIA\nadvanced security practitioner\n\n8\n00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.190\nepisodes coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.200\nAnd in this one we're going to look at\nsomething called application sandboxing.\n\n10\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.290\nAnd Sean, I don't think we're talking\nabout taking our applications outside and\n\n11\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.550\nplaying with them in the sandbox.\n\n12\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.340\nSo, what are we talking about here?\n\n13\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.940\n>> I would do that, that's a great idea.\n\n14\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.225\n>> Have a little Tonka truck.\n\n15\n00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:42.686\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Some little matchbox cars,\n\n16\n00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:43.482\nwe're good to go.\n\n17\n00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:46.692\n>> Hey, you know, after doing all this\nstuff it's probably a good break.\n\n18\n00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:53.895\n[LAUGH] Yeah well I mean we're definitely\nnot talking something like that, but\n\n19\n00:00:53.895 --> 00:00:59.320\nwhen we talk about sandboxing,\nsandboxing is a technique they use,\n\n20\n00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.990\nand there's several different\nways to implement it.\n\n21\n00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.130\nBut it all comes down to a way\nto kind of compartmentalize, or\n\n22\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.380\nenclose an application and\nwrap it in such a way that it has its\n\n23\n00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.280\naccess restricted to what's\noutside in the big wide world.\n\n24\n00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.860\nSo, we're doing it for security reasons\nof course, because by doing this we\n\n25\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.690\ncan perhaps stop the spread\nof things like malware.\n\n26\n00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.740\nWe could stop things from\naccessing what's in other boxes or\n\n27\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.430\nother areas of the system that might\nbe more sensitive information.\n\n28\n00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.640\nWe can just do some interesting\nstuff there to really restrict\n\n29\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.718\nwhat's happening in control access.\n\n30\n00:01:46.718 --> 00:01:50.070\n>> So it's kinda like isolating\nthe application then,\n\n31\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.510\nin its own little environment.\n\n32\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.621\nAnd I almost don't have to worry about\noutside influences and things like that.\n\n33\n00:01:55.621 --> 00:02:01.367\n>> Yeah, that's exactly what you would\nhave by doing something like this,\n\n34\n00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:05.269\nand you do see this in\na number of different cases.\n\n35\n00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:10.417\nI mean, ones that immediately\ncome to mind would be\n\n36\n00:02:10.417 --> 00:02:16.730\nstuff like the browser in\nWindows from Vista forward.\n\n37\n00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.205\nThere's a mode in there on the 64-bit side\nwhere you can, in essence, have it running\n\n38\n00:02:21.205 --> 00:02:24.664\nin a sandbox where it's got it's own\nlittle piece of the registry and\n\n39\n00:02:24.664 --> 00:02:27.075\nit's got a piece of\nthe system it has access to.\n\n40\n00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:29.641\nAnd that's all locked down\nto just those things,\n\n41\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.080\nunless you decide to turn it off that is.\n\n42\n00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.470\nIt's got those, but\nthen you also have another notable\n\n43\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.820\nside of this is the isolation or\nsandboxing that happens with Java.\n\n44\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.435\nJava as a language\nimplements that as well.\n\n45\n00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:49.420\nWhere, unless you do something special,\nbasically signing your application,\n\n46\n00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.230\nusing the digital signature technology\nto verify where it came from and\n\n47\n00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.250\nthat someone's on the level,\nit puts it in the sandbox.\n\n48\n00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.810\nSo the stuff running in that\nmachine is kept enclosed and\n\n49\n00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.620\nisolated so it doesn't really get\na lot of access to the outside world.\n\n50\n00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.840\nIt has to kind of, it can do a few things,\nbut it's extremely limited.\n\n51\n00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.350\nBut those would be\na couple examples of it.\n\n52\n00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.461\nBut I think it's kind of also\nimportant here to maybe make\n\n53\n00:03:16.461 --> 00:03:19.898\na distinction when you\ntalk about sandboxing.\n\n54\n00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:24.768\nBecause you use the term isolation, and\nthe description I'm using also could\n\n55\n00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:28.457\nbe something that could be\na situation where you're like,\n\n56\n00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:32.177\nis he talking virtualization or\nis he talking sandboxing?\n\n57\n00:03:32.177 --> 00:03:37.240\nThere can be some confusion there and\nin a lot of cases they're the same,\n\n58\n00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.510\nbut there's other situations where\nthey're decidedly different.\n\n59\n00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.800\nSandboxing, as we're talking here,\nis more along the lines of\n\n60\n00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.598\ndoing an individual application and\nreally doing the isolation at that level.\n\n61\n00:03:50.598 --> 00:03:55.660\nAnd really restricting what happens,\nif anything happens at all,\n\n62\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.950\nbetween the two sides of what's\ninside the box and what's outside.\n\n63\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.260\nVirtualization, you tend to have\n\n64\n00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.290\nmore control without having to do\ntoo much of the special things.\n\n65\n00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.070\nYou'd still have more control over what\nlevel of access you can do either way.\n\n66\n00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.540\nSome virtualization systems like Hyper-V,\nyou can't, for example,\n\n67\n00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.660\ndrag and drop between the host and\nthe guest, but you can set up stuff like\n\n68\n00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.100\nsharing of the files on the system that\nmakes you kind of go through that one.\n\n69\n00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.340\nBut there's other ones that\ndon't take that into account.\n\n70\n00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.940\nThey're isolated but you can drag and\ndrop back and forth, and so\n\n71\n00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.790\nit's not as rigidly enforcing\nthe isolation as the other ones would.\n\n72\n00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.017\nSo we're talking more about, like I said,\nstuff at the application level,\n\n73\n00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.003\nstuff like that.\n\n74\n00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:49.490\nBut the term sandboxing, to be quite\nhonest, is used quite liberally.\n\n75\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.880\nYou'll hear that term used all over\nthe place and, what can you say?\n\n76\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.920\nAs long as you've got the basic concept\ndown that you're putting something\n\n77\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.060\nin this box and giving it its own area to\nplay in, hence the term [LAUGH] sandbox.\n\n78\n00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.421\nThen you're pretty much in\nthe right zip code, I guess.\n\n79\n00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:15.815\n>> Gotcha, and then so you've got the\ndifferent models that we can do with our\n\n80\n00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:20.685\nsandbox, like you mentioned with that\napplication or through virtualization.\n\n81\n00:05:20.685 --> 00:05:25.240\n>> Yeah, you can use it\nthose two ways and, in fact,\n\n82\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.530\nI mentioned just to put\na kind of a spin on this.\n\n83\n00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.180\nI just told you,\nJava uses that sandboxing model so\n\n84\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.730\nwhen you're running something\nin the browser or on the system\n\n85\n00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.368\nit's got that box around it unless the\ndeveloper decides to digitally sign it.\n\n86\n00:05:42.368 --> 00:05:48.100\nWell, Iguess what they call the stuff\nthat runs Java on an individual system.\n\n87\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.120\nThey call them JVMs,\nJava Virtual Machines.\n\n88\n00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.580\nSo I just told you it uses the sandbox,\nand I'm telling you, oh, virtualization,\n\n89\n00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.690\nsandboxing, there's some similarities,\nbut there's also differences there too.\n\n90\n00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.550\nWell, that just really just messed you\nup cuz I went through and said, oh,\n\n91\n00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.585\nwell Java uses sandboxing, but\nthey've got Java Virtual Machines.\n\n92\n00:06:03.585 --> 00:06:07.155\nWhat, what is that?\n\n93\n00:06:07.155 --> 00:06:09.474\nIt's terminology, right?\n\n94\n00:06:09.474 --> 00:06:12.214\nThey can decide to change the game on you,\nand\n\n95\n00:06:12.214 --> 00:06:15.830\nthat's what they kinda played\naround with a bit there.\n\n96\n00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.920\n>> So is it something that I\ncan do with any application?\n\n97\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.230\nOr do I need another application\nto do this for me, or?\n\n98\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.590\n>> It's really one of\nthose things that depends.\n\n99\n00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.990\nThere are situations\nwhere it's just provided\n\n100\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.680\nas part of its core functioning on Java.\n\n101\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.840\nJava has that built-in to it\nas part of its foundation.\n\n102\n00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.330\nAnd so it's a core thing,\nit's provided by default.\n\n103\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.910\nYou don't have to do\nanything special to get it.\n\n104\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:51.580\nHowever, there's a lot of applications\nthat you might want to sandbox but\n\n105\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.560\nyou just can't because they\nweren't designed that way.\n\n106\n00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.350\nOr you can't do it easily because\nthey weren't designed that way.\n\n107\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.710\nUsually if you really kinda look for\nthe solutions you can do sandboxing.\n\n108\n00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.140\nIt's just a question of do you really want\nto do it, and are you willing to look for\n\n109\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.810\nthe solution.\n\n110\n00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.320\nBut some things are already provided,\n\n111\n00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.010\nother stuff you actually have\nto go hunt down a solution.\n\n112\n00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.320\nSo with stuff like Java, there.\n\n113\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.260\nStuff like the browser IE, it's already\nthere, turned on, and ready to go.\n\n114\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.382\nBut if you want to virtualize\nsomething else then, and it\n\n115\n00:07:26.382 --> 00:07:31.144\ndoesn't provide that functionality itself,\nthen you gotta figure out how to get it.\n\n116\n00:07:31.144 --> 00:07:32.442\n>> Gotcha, gotcha, so\n\n117\n00:07:32.442 --> 00:07:36.635\nwhat's some of the applications we\nmight use to do some sandboxing?\n\n118\n00:07:36.635 --> 00:07:43.190\n>> Well, that's the question there,\nis what can you use to do that?\n\n119\n00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.719\nThere's a few solutions.\n\n120\n00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:48.794\nOne of the ones that I kinda\nwanna introduce people to,\n\n121\n00:07:48.794 --> 00:07:53.398\nto do this sort of thing if they\nwant to play with it Is something\n\n122\n00:07:53.398 --> 00:07:56.521\ncalled Sandboxie, is what they call it.\n\n123\n00:07:56.521 --> 00:07:57.632\n>> Clever [LAUGH].\n\n124\n00:07:57.632 --> 00:08:01.617\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] it's got kind of a little\nbit of an interesting history to it.\n\n125\n00:08:01.617 --> 00:08:06.318\nAnd I have it up here on my screen\non my system here ready to go.\n\n126\n00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:09.960\nAnd just from the get go\nit doesn't look like much.\n\n127\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.180\nSo you see,\nthis is the console right here.\n\n128\n00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.110\nEven though you're not seeing much,\nthis is the console.\n\n129\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:26.110\nSo, all I did was install this and didn't\ndo anything really special to set this up.\n\n130\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.816\nJust installed it, and\nsaid hey, here you go.\n\n131\n00:08:29.816 --> 00:08:34.350\nWell, you can set up additional\nsandboxes if you want.\n\n132\n00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.280\nRight now, I just have the one.\n\n133\n00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.990\nThis is the one that came\nright out of the box.\n\n134\n00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.966\nAnd this thing just sits here,\n\n135\n00:08:41.966 --> 00:08:45.780\nwhen you install it it runs\ndown in your system tray.\n\n136\n00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.998\nSo you can see it's running here.\n\n137\n00:08:47.998 --> 00:08:51.297\nI just right-click on it and tell it I\nwant to see the console and this comes up.\n\n138\n00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:55.390\nYou don't have to start\nthe whole console up every time.\n\n139\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:02.670\nLet's just say we have a situation\nwhere we want to sandbox a browser.\n\n140\n00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.780\nSo that's a concern of\nyours because let's look at\n\n141\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.645\nthe issues we have with web browsers and\nwhy you might want to do this.\n\n142\n00:09:11.645 --> 00:09:16.765\nIs you look at a web browser,\na web browser by its very\n\n143\n00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:22.623\nnature you have something on your system\nthat's opening up into an untrusted area,\n\n144\n00:09:22.623 --> 00:09:24.905\nbeing the Internet.\n\n145\n00:09:24.905 --> 00:09:27.945\nAnd then you are taking content\nfrom that untrusted area,\n\n146\n00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:30.540\nbringing it down to that system and\nrunning it locally.\n\n147\n00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.670\nAnd, just think about that,\n\n148\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:38.170\nyou're taking stuff from your trusted area\nout in untrusted and bringing it down.\n\n149\n00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.180\nSo you're opening a conduit directly into\nthat and pulling stuff onto the system.\n\n150\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.920\nSo it definitely opens up some doors.\n\n151\n00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.625\n>> Concerns there?\n\n152\n00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:50.930\n>> Yeah, some major security concerns.\n\n153\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.286\nSo you want to do something to\nkind of stem the tide of that.\n\n154\n00:09:55.286 --> 00:09:59.180\nSo what you could do is,\nif your browser doesn't support it,\n\n155\n00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.110\nyou can use this to support that ability.\n\n156\n00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.140\nAnd so, and then interestingly enough,\njust kind of a side note to this, you\n\n157\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.620\nlook at the name of it, called Sandboxie,\nand you look at the way it's spelled.\n\n158\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.170\nI mean that was actually,\n\n159\n00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.310\nthat I-E was actually a separate\nthing at the end for a while.\n\n160\n00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.540\nThe people originally created this for\n\n161\n00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.970\nInternet Explorer to isolate Internet\nExplorer before they implemented that\n\n162\n00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.940\nsandboxing model in Vista,\nthey had that around.\n\n163\n00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.529\nSo this was a way of providing\nthat security but they long\n\n164\n00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:36.000\nsince realized that, hey,\nthis is a good idea.\n\n165\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.020\nThis is a pretty good product, pretty\nsimple product, and we'll just let it so\n\n166\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.745\nit could be used with all\nthese other things too.\n\n167\n00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:45.955\nAnd so,\nreally cool that they gave us that.\n\n168\n00:10:45.955 --> 00:10:51.925\nIn fact, on my system here,\nI've got a couple browsers on it.\n\n169\n00:10:51.925 --> 00:10:56.455\nYou can see I've got Chrome and\nI've got Firefox down there at the bottom.\n\n170\n00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:58.129\nI do not have IE on this system.\n\n171\n00:10:58.129 --> 00:10:59.498\n>> You're missing Internet Explorer, yeah.\n\n172\n00:10:59.498 --> 00:11:01.964\n>> Yeah, I hunted it down and killed it.\n\n173\n00:11:01.964 --> 00:11:04.166\nI do not like Internet Explorer.\n\n174\n00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:08.152\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And honestly,\n\n175\n00:11:08.152 --> 00:11:14.510\nit's not a Microsoft bashing thing,\nit's just not my preferred browser.\n\n176\n00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.608\nAnd so, I just figured,\nI tend to use Chrome and\n\n177\n00:11:18.608 --> 00:11:23.539\nI tend to use Firefox as my\nmain browsers most of the time.\n\n178\n00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:27.308\nI'll just clear the space\nthat IE is using since it\n\n179\n00:11:27.308 --> 00:11:30.460\nwas just sitting there collecting dust.\n\n180\n00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:35.480\nIt wasn't a specific security concern or\nany hatred of Microsoft that did it.\n\n181\n00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.900\nI just wanna [LAUGH] make that clear.\n\n182\n00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.730\nI uninstalled it because I just\ndidn't need it, so get rid of it.\n\n183\n00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.500\nIt goes to that whole thing\nwe talked about yesterday,\n\n184\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.290\nby the way too, of hardening.\n\n185\n00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.490\nI don't need it there, I have the ability\nto remove it, so I got it out of there.\n\n186\n00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.350\nThat's kinda that thought process, too.\n\n187\n00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:59.530\nAll right, so we got Sandboxie up here,\nI got the sandbox defaults.\n\n188\n00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:06.335\nWhat I can do is, I can right-click on\nthis, and it says okay, Run Sandbox.\n\n189\n00:12:06.335 --> 00:12:12.305\nWell, here t's got some stuff set up for\nyou by default.\n\n190\n00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:15.455\nYou see the web browser, email reader,\nyou can choose your program,\n\n191\n00:12:15.455 --> 00:12:19.595\nyou can go to Start menu, or you can open\nup Windows Explorer and go through that.\n\n192\n00:12:19.595 --> 00:12:22.655\nIt will sandbox all sorts\nof combinations of things.\n\n193\n00:12:22.655 --> 00:12:26.800\nIf you go to the web browser and\nI click on it, you can see in here,\n\n194\n00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.480\nit's starting in that Sandbox.\n\n195\n00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.240\nIt started up Firefox, you can see\nthere's some other stuff going on there.\n\n196\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.380\nI don't need to have that console running,\nby the way.\n\n197\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.648\nThat console can be minimized.\n\n198\n00:12:36.648 --> 00:12:41.130\nThat's really, I opened it up for your\nbenefit, so you can see what Sandboxie,\n\n199\n00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.800\nthe application looks like.\n\n200\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.530\nYou can see over here that\nI've got a minimized version,\n\n201\n00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:51.250\nso you can see it popping up\nwhy I've got Sandboxie up.\n\n202\n00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.915\nYou can see that the browser did indeed\nstart, that browser is sandboxed.\n\n203\n00:12:54.915 --> 00:12:58.500\nThat's not something that\nFirefox does on its own.\n\n204\n00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.240\nIt's something that Sandboxie\nhas put that wrapper around it.\n\n205\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.930\nWhat's really neat about this is that if\nthere's a question in your mind of whether\n\n206\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:11.190\nor not that's actually a sandbox or not,\nlook, I've hovered over it for a second.\n\n207\n00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.970\nAnd it drew that little yellow\nborder around it saying, by the way,\n\n208\n00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:20.330\nthis is not running the normal way,\nthis has been sandboxed.\n\n209\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.020\nSo I've got something\nthere that's sandboxed.\n\n210\n00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:30.430\nSo I can just go ahead and use it, there's\nnothing special I gotta do at this point.\n\n211\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.540\nI went ahead and ran the browser.\n\n212\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.430\nI can go in and start just use it like\nI always have, nothing I gotta do.\n\n213\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.980\nIf I save files and\nstuff like that on there,\n\n214\n00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:46.790\nthen that is something that you do have\nto take a little bit of consideration of.\n\n215\n00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:50.610\nAnything I do inside that sandbox,\ndownloading files,\n\n216\n00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.960\nthey will be saved to that sandbox.\n\n217\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.420\nYou kill the sandbox,\nthose files are going bye bye.\n\n218\n00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.950\nThat's what you want.\n\n219\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.730\nYou don't want that stuff\nbeing saved on the system cuz\n\n220\n00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.080\nthat would defeat the whole\npurpose of doing this.\n\n221\n00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.035\nBut that begs the question,\nwhat do you do if you want those files,\n\n222\n00:14:07.035 --> 00:14:11.880\nif you've saved something, and presumably\nyou've saved your system for a reason.\n\n223\n00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:18.250\nYou can, when you go through this,\nit has the ability to go through and\n\n224\n00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.550\nview the contents of each\nindividual application.\n\n225\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.560\nSo you do have the ability to go through\nthe menus, depending what application\n\n226\n00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.020\nyou're talking about, and say okay, or\njust right-click on the application.\n\n227\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.880\nAnd saying, I wanna go and\ndrag those files out of there.\n\n228\n00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.753\nYou could say,\nokay they're clear, I trust them.\n\n229\n00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:41.609\nYou can just say okay, grab that file and\ndrag it onto your desktop and\n\n230\n00:14:41.609 --> 00:14:44.640\nyou're done, you've got what you need.\n\n231\n00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.025\nSo it's really, really neat and\nreally, really powerful.\n\n232\n00:14:49.025 --> 00:14:53.955\nAnd you can even, in here, if I were\nto right-click on this default sandbox,\n\n233\n00:14:53.955 --> 00:14:58.785\nwhat would happen is it would, and\nsay start another application,\n\n234\n00:14:58.785 --> 00:15:01.962\nit would start another\napplication that sandbox.\n\n235\n00:15:01.962 --> 00:15:05.492\nRemember what I was talking\nabout with Sandboxie,\n\n236\n00:15:05.492 --> 00:15:10.572\none of the benefits you can reap from\nit is, let's just say for kicks I\n\n237\n00:15:10.572 --> 00:15:15.022\nhad a couple applications I wanted to run\nthat were on different security levels.\n\n238\n00:15:15.022 --> 00:15:18.993\nSo one's processing high security stuff,\none's processing lower security stuff.\n\n239\n00:15:18.993 --> 00:15:23.847\nWell, I want to make sure when I'm\nrunning those that these two things don't\n\n240\n00:15:23.847 --> 00:15:29.270\ncross paths, because they're processing\nstuff at different context levels.\n\n241\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.740\nI don't want them interfering.\n\n242\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.520\nWell, running them in the same sandbox\njust shoots that whole process in\n\n243\n00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.380\nthe foot,\nthat's not gonna be helpful to you.\n\n244\n00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.364\nWhat you can do is you\ncan go through here and\n\n245\n00:15:42.364 --> 00:15:49.685\ncreate new sandboxes with their own\nsettings as much as you want to configure.\n\n246\n00:15:49.685 --> 00:15:53.491\nAnd then just take those applications,\nassign it to that other sandbox.\n\n247\n00:15:53.491 --> 00:15:54.989\nAnd you only have to do that once.\n\n248\n00:15:54.989 --> 00:16:00.270\nAssign it over there, and once you've done\nthat, start the application over there.\n\n249\n00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.050\nThey've been compartmentalized\nunder their own boxes.\n\n250\n00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.930\nSo, you can start one over here,\nand one over here.\n\n251\n00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.920\nThey will run the same desktop.\n\n252\n00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.940\nLook like normal, act like normal,\ndo everything you would expect them to.\n\n253\n00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.810\nExcept behind the scenes, they have\nbeen put in their own corners, and\n\n254\n00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.740\nthey don't touch in any way,\nshape, or form.\n\n255\n00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.740\nThe only way they would do that is if\nyou both ran them on the desktop without\n\n256\n00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:28.520\nSandboxie, or if you ran them\nin the same sandbox themselves.\n\n257\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.110\nAnd you can pretty much have,\nas far as I know,\n\n258\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:35.950\nI've never had to push it,\nsomething like this to any sort of limit.\n\n259\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:40.170\nAs far as I understand, you can\nhave as many sandboxes as you want.\n\n260\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.190\nAnd you can have all sorts of combinations\nand do all that good stuff with it.\n\n261\n00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:47.790\nI mean, you might choose to isolate just\na couple applications from one another.\n\n262\n00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.720\nOr isolate an application\nfrom everything else.\n\n263\n00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.550\nYou can group them in different ways.\n\n264\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.840\nYou can have a sandbox that has,\n\n265\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.230\nall the stuff that has,\none common security rating.\n\n266\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.520\nYou can throw them in one thing and then,\n\n267\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.490\nyou can have another one that\nhas everything else, and\n\n268\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:03.640\nhas another security rating.\n\n269\n00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.700\nI mean,\nyou can get really creative with this, but\n\n270\n00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:12.250\nthe thing being that,\nyou can really lock down and say.\n\n271\n00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.210\nAnd lock down and\nprotect access between applications.\n\n272\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.090\nAnd keep these things from maybe\ntouching or having any problems.\n\n273\n00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:23.040\nI think it's just a really\nfantastic way to do stuff.\n\n274\n00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:29.410\nI happen to like Sandboxie, but\nthere are other ones that do this.\n\n275\n00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.940\nIf you want, try Sandboxie and,\nI can't think of the URL for it right now.\n\n276\n00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.880\n>> I've got it right here.\n\n277\n00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.810\nI'll put it our there for them.\n\n278\n00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.450\n>> Yeah, Sandboxie, you can grab that.\n\n279\n00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:44.150\nThere is a kind of a demo\nslash trial version.\n\n280\n00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:50.670\nThat's why I've got here and\nthen they have like single user, and\n\n281\n00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:56.530\neven enterprise user versions of it, if\nyou choose to use it at those levels so.\n\n282\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.010\nI would encourage you, yes.\n\n283\n00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.940\nEspecially there's, I think we even have\na home version too that's completely free\n\n284\n00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.250\nif you choose to use it there,\nso you might try it.\n\n285\n00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.840\nI wouldn't encourage,\nhey it's something that you like.\n\n286\n00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.210\nI knew you can you and\nyou like in the homing environment.\n\n287\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.660\nIt's really great for an enterprise\nenvironment too under certain situation.\n\n288\n00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.640\nAnd so, take a look.\n\n289\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.670\nIt might be something that is worth you,\n\n290\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:28.060\nto spend the money on for your business,\nin providing an extra layer of protection.\n\n291\n00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.010\n>> You have the ability to do some of the\ntesting of those applications that we were\n\n292\n00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:34.310\ntalking about in previous\nepisodes as well.\n\n293\n00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.120\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n294\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:42.250\nAbsolutely a way to do that to really\nprotect yourself and wrap things up.\n\n295\n00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.730\nAnd like I said, there's other\nones out there, that do this.\n\n296\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:50.960\nI've just found that Sandboxie tends to\nbe one of the easiest ways to implement\n\n297\n00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:56.660\nSandboxing on a system and to reap all\nthe benefits that go with it, so yeah,\n\n298\n00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:02.060\ncheck it out, but the underlying cons,\nno matter what you use, is still the same.\n\n299\n00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:08.510\nSandboxing is a way of isolating or\ncontrolling access to resources,\n\n300\n00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:13.410\nand limiting the access of applications in\nwhat they can do, so you don't have this,\n\n301\n00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.100\nthis spread of things or\nthis interference or anything like that.\n\n302\n00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.860\n>> All right, well Sean a lot of good\ninfo there on how we can you know,\n\n303\n00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.850\nsafely, if I can say that,\nsafely test applications, and\n\n304\n00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.370\nmaybe you're downloading an application,\n\n305\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.210\nor you're thinking about putting\nan application as part of your image.\n\n306\n00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.740\nYou wanna test it first and\nsee what it does.\n\n307\n00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.270\nNow you got a way to isolate\nit from everything else,\n\n308\n00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.920\nand see exactly what it's doing\nwithout putting your systems at risk.\n\n309\n00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.850\n>> Yeah, I like that you brought that up\nbecause that's a very good point that I\n\n310\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.867\nneglected [LAUGH] to bring up.\n\n311\n00:19:43.867 --> 00:19:46.390\nI mean is there's that,\n\n312\n00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:51.210\nthis is a good way to test a lot of\nthe stuff that we've been talking about.\n\n313\n00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.590\nIt's not going to be 100% in every case.\n\n314\n00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.620\nSome of that stuff just isn't going to be\nsuited to doing a Sandbox environment.\n\n315\n00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.960\nBut it's definitely not a bad idea to\ntry it within that Sandbox environment,\n\n316\n00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.050\nto see maybe this is ideal.\n\n317\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:11.360\nBut at the end of the day, hey, you may\nhave to go and do a full virtual system,\n\n318\n00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.730\nor you may not even be able to do virtual.\n\n319\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.920\nYou may have to get a physical\nbox to put this on.\n\n320\n00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.960\nBecause there's some things that we have\nin the testing and security world that\n\n321\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:25.280\njust are not gonna work unless\ntheir physically on a box period.\n\n322\n00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.230\nBut for\ntesting a good number of things yeah,\n\n323\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:33.960\nthis would be an awesome thing to use for\nthat without having to,\n\n324\n00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:39.130\nI love virtualization as much as the next\nperson does, and I know the benefits\n\n325\n00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:43.700\nof it, but virtualization does seem\nnow and then to have its quirks, and\n\n326\n00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.890\neven those things aside,\nstill it's still kind of a resource hog.\n\n327\n00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.720\n>> That was a lot easier than\nspinning up a new machine,\n\n328\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.400\nand getting that application\ninstalled on there, and trying to\n\n329\n00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.840\nisolate that virtual machine, so I can\ndefinitely see the usefulness of that.\n\n330\n00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.170\n>> Absolutely.\n\n331\n00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.880\nAlright well a lot of\ngood info there Sean.\n\n332\n00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.310\nAnything else we need to talk\nabout when it comes to Sandboxing?\n\n333\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.160\n>> Not really.\n\n334\n00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.390\nI think we've covered\nwhat the points were.\n\n335\n00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.440\nYou can see it's actually\na pretty simple concept, I think.\n\n336\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.460\nAnd you saw really quickly how to\nuse an application to isolate stuff.\n\n337\n00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:24.780\nSo if you got that down, what Sandboxing\nis, and and what it looks like,\n\n338\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.960\nand you're good, you're good, it's just\na question of how you're gonna do it, and\n\n339\n00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.300\nthis can be done in code, by the way,\nyou don't have to do it this way.\n\n340\n00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.690\nThere's ways to write code\nin certain languages, and\n\n341\n00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.190\nstuff like that that they provide that for\nyou, such as Java.\n\n342\n00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.980\nSo that, it's not just limited to doing it\nlike this, you can do it other ways too.\n\n343\n00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.780\n>> Very good, all right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, that's gonna do it for\n\n344\n00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.370\nthis episode.\n\n345\n00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.670\nHope you enjoyed watching.\n\n346\n00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.940\nSigning off for ITProTV,

Rodrick.\n\n3\n00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.221\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:17.420\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.780\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.520\n>> I'm doing great, excited to be here.\n\n7\n00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.260\nWe got another of our CompTIA\nadvanced security practitioner\n\n8\n00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.190\nepisodes coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.200\nAnd in this one we're going to look at\nsomething called application sandboxing.\n\n10\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.290\nAnd Sean, I don't think we're talking\nabout taking our applications outside and\n\n11\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.550\nplaying with them in the sandbox.\n\n12\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.340\nSo, what are we talking about here?\n\n13\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.940\n>> I would do that, that's a great idea.\n\n14\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.225\n>> Have a little Tonka truck.\n\n15\n00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:42.686\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Some little matchbox cars,\n\n16\n00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:43.482\nwe're good to go.\n\n17\n00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:46.692\n>> Hey, you know, after doing all this\nstuff it's probably a good break.\n\n18\n00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:53.895\n[LAUGH] Yeah well I mean we're definitely\nnot talking something like that, but\n\n19\n00:00:53.895 --> 00:00:59.320\nwhen we talk about sandboxing,\nsandboxing is a technique they use,\n\n20\n00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.990\nand there's several different\nways to implement it.\n\n21\n00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.130\nBut it all comes down to a way\nto kind of compartmentalize, or\n\n22\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.380\nenclose an application and\nwrap it in such a way that it has its\n\n23\n00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.280\naccess restricted to what's\noutside in the big wide world.\n\n24\n00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.860\nSo, we're doing it for security reasons\nof course, because by doing this we\n\n25\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.690\ncan perhaps stop the spread\nof things like malware.\n\n26\n00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.740\nWe could stop things from\naccessing what's in other boxes or\n\n27\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.430\nother areas of the system that might\nbe more sensitive information.\n\n28\n00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.640\nWe can just do some interesting\nstuff there to really restrict\n\n29\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.718\nwhat's happening in control access.\n\n30\n00:01:46.718 --> 00:01:50.070\n>> So it's kinda like isolating\nthe application then,\n\n31\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.510\nin its own little environment.\n\n32\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.621\nAnd I almost don't have to worry about\noutside influences and things like that.\n\n33\n00:01:55.621 --> 00:02:01.367\n>> Yeah, that's exactly what you would\nhave by doing something like this,\n\n34\n00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:05.269\nand you do see this in\na number of different cases.\n\n35\n00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:10.417\nI mean, ones that immediately\ncome to mind would be\n\n36\n00:02:10.417 --> 00:02:16.730\nstuff like the browser in\nWindows from Vista forward.\n\n37\n00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.205\nThere's a mode in there on the 64-bit side\nwhere you can, in essence, have it running\n\n38\n00:02:21.205 --> 00:02:24.664\nin a sandbox where it's got it's own\nlittle piece of the registry and\n\n39\n00:02:24.664 --> 00:02:27.075\nit's got a piece of\nthe system it has access to.\n\n40\n00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:29.641\nAnd that's all locked down\nto just those things,\n\n41\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.080\nunless you decide to turn it off that is.\n\n42\n00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.470\nIt's got those, but\nthen you also have another notable\n\n43\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.820\nside of this is the isolation or\nsandboxing that happens with Java.\n\n44\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.435\nJava as a language\nimplements that as well.\n\n45\n00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:49.420\nWhere, unless you do something special,\nbasically signing your application,\n\n46\n00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.230\nusing the digital signature technology\nto verify where it came from and\n\n47\n00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.250\nthat someone's on the level,\nit puts it in the sandbox.\n\n48\n00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.810\nSo the stuff running in that\nmachine is kept enclosed and\n\n49\n00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.620\nisolated so it doesn't really get\na lot of access to the outside world.\n\n50\n00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.840\nIt has to kind of, it can do a few things,\nbut it's extremely limited.\n\n51\n00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.350\nBut those would be\na couple examples of it.\n\n52\n00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.461\nBut I think it's kind of also\nimportant here to maybe make\n\n53\n00:03:16.461 --> 00:03:19.898\na distinction when you\ntalk about sandboxing.\n\n54\n00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:24.768\nBecause you use the term isolation, and\nthe description I'm using also could\n\n55\n00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:28.457\nbe something that could be\na situation where you're like,\n\n56\n00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:32.177\nis he talking virtualization or\nis he talking sandboxing?\n\n57\n00:03:32.177 --> 00:03:37.240\nThere can be some confusion there and\nin a lot of cases they're the same,\n\n58\n00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.510\nbut there's other situations where\nthey're decidedly different.\n\n59\n00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.800\nSandboxing, as we're talking here,\nis more along the lines of\n\n60\n00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.598\ndoing an individual application and\nreally doing the isolation at that level.\n\n61\n00:03:50.598 --> 00:03:55.660\nAnd really restricting what happens,\nif anything happens at all,\n\n62\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.950\nbetween the two sides of what's\ninside the box and what's outside.\n\n63\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.260\nVirtualization, you tend to have\n\n64\n00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.290\nmore control without having to do\ntoo much of the special things.\n\n65\n00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.070\nYou'd still have more control over what\nlevel of access you can do either way.\n\n66\n00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.540\nSome virtualization systems like Hyper-V,\nyou can't, for example,\n\n67\n00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.660\ndrag and drop between the host and\nthe guest, but you can set up stuff like\n\n68\n00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.100\nsharing of the files on the system that\nmakes you kind of go through that one.\n\n69\n00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.340\nBut there's other ones that\ndon't take that into account.\n\n70\n00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.940\nThey're isolated but you can drag and\ndrop back and forth, and so\n\n71\n00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.790\nit's not as rigidly enforcing\nthe isolation as the other ones would.\n\n72\n00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.017\nSo we're talking more about, like I said,\nstuff at the application level,\n\n73\n00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.003\nstuff like that.\n\n74\n00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:49.490\nBut the term sandboxing, to be quite\nhonest, is used quite liberally.\n\n75\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.880\nYou'll hear that term used all over\nthe place and, what can you say?\n\n76\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.920\nAs long as you've got the basic concept\ndown that you're putting something\n\n77\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.060\nin this box and giving it its own area to\nplay in, hence the term [LAUGH] sandbox.\n\n78\n00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.421\nThen you're pretty much in\nthe right zip code, I guess.\n\n79\n00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:15.815\n>> Gotcha, and then so you've got the\ndifferent models that we can do with our\n\n80\n00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:20.685\nsandbox, like you mentioned with that\napplication or through virtualization.\n\n81\n00:05:20.685 --> 00:05:25.240\n>> Yeah, you can use it\nthose two ways and, in fact,\n\n82\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.530\nI mentioned just to put\na kind of a spin on this.\n\n83\n00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.180\nI just told you,\nJava uses that sandboxing model so\n\n84\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.730\nwhen you're running something\nin the browser or on the system\n\n85\n00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.368\nit's got that box around it unless the\ndeveloper decides to digitally sign it.\n\n86\n00:05:42.368 --> 00:05:48.100\nWell, Iguess what they call the stuff\nthat runs Java on an individual system.\n\n87\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.120\nThey call them JVMs,\nJava Virtual Machines.\n\n88\n00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.580\nSo I just told you it uses the sandbox,\nand I'm telling you, oh, virtualization,\n\n89\n00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.690\nsandboxing, there's some similarities,\nbut there's also differences there too.\n\n90\n00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.550\nWell, that just really just messed you\nup cuz I went through and said, oh,\n\n91\n00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.585\nwell Java uses sandboxing, but\nthey've got Java Virtual Machines.\n\n92\n00:06:03.585 --> 00:06:07.155\nWhat, what is that?\n\n93\n00:06:07.155 --> 00:06:09.474\nIt's terminology, right?\n\n94\n00:06:09.474 --> 00:06:12.214\nThey can decide to change the game on you,\nand\n\n95\n00:06:12.214 --> 00:06:15.830\nthat's what they kinda played\naround with a bit there.\n\n96\n00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.920\n>> So is it something that I\ncan do with any application?\n\n97\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.230\nOr do I need another application\nto do this for me, or?\n\n98\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.590\n>> It's really one of\nthose things that depends.\n\n99\n00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.990\nThere are situations\nwhere it's just provided\n\n100\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.680\nas part of its core functioning on Java.\n\n101\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.840\nJava has that built-in to it\nas part of its foundation.\n\n102\n00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.330\nAnd so it's a core thing,\nit's provided by default.\n\n103\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.910\nYou don't have to do\nanything special to get it.\n\n104\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:51.580\nHowever, there's a lot of applications\nthat you might want to sandbox but\n\n105\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.560\nyou just can't because they\nweren't designed that way.\n\n106\n00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.350\nOr you can't do it easily because\nthey weren't designed that way.\n\n107\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.710\nUsually if you really kinda look for\nthe solutions you can do sandboxing.\n\n108\n00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.140\nIt's just a question of do you really want\nto do it, and are you willing to look for\n\n109\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.810\nthe solution.\n\n110\n00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.320\nBut some things are already provided,\n\n111\n00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.010\nother stuff you actually have\nto go hunt down a solution.\n\n112\n00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.320\nSo with stuff like Java, there.\n\n113\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.260\nStuff like the browser IE, it's already\nthere, turned on, and ready to go.\n\n114\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.382\nBut if you want to virtualize\nsomething else then, and it\n\n115\n00:07:26.382 --> 00:07:31.144\ndoesn't provide that functionality itself,\nthen you gotta figure out how to get it.\n\n116\n00:07:31.144 --> 00:07:32.442\n>> Gotcha, gotcha, so\n\n117\n00:07:32.442 --> 00:07:36.635\nwhat's some of the applications we\nmight use to do some sandboxing?\n\n118\n00:07:36.635 --> 00:07:43.190\n>> Well, that's the question there,\nis what can you use to do that?\n\n119\n00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.719\nThere's a few solutions.\n\n120\n00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:48.794\nOne of the ones that I kinda\nwanna introduce people to,\n\n121\n00:07:48.794 --> 00:07:53.398\nto do this sort of thing if they\nwant to play with it Is something\n\n122\n00:07:53.398 --> 00:07:56.521\ncalled Sandboxie, is what they call it.\n\n123\n00:07:56.521 --> 00:07:57.632\n>> Clever [LAUGH].\n\n124\n00:07:57.632 --> 00:08:01.617\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] it's got kind of a little\nbit of an interesting history to it.\n\n125\n00:08:01.617 --> 00:08:06.318\nAnd I have it up here on my screen\non my system here ready to go.\n\n126\n00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:09.960\nAnd just from the get go\nit doesn't look like much.\n\n127\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.180\nSo you see,\nthis is the console right here.\n\n128\n00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.110\nEven though you're not seeing much,\nthis is the console.\n\n129\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:26.110\nSo, all I did was install this and didn't\ndo anything really special to set this up.\n\n130\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.816\nJust installed it, and\nsaid hey, here you go.\n\n131\n00:08:29.816 --> 00:08:34.350\nWell, you can set up additional\nsandboxes if you want.\n\n132\n00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.280\nRight now, I just have the one.\n\n133\n00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.990\nThis is the one that came\nright out of the box.\n\n134\n00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.966\nAnd this thing just sits here,\n\n135\n00:08:41.966 --> 00:08:45.780\nwhen you install it it runs\ndown in your system tray.\n\n136\n00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.998\nSo you can see it's running here.\n\n137\n00:08:47.998 --> 00:08:51.297\nI just right-click on it and tell it I\nwant to see the console and this comes up.\n\n138\n00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:55.390\nYou don't have to start\nthe whole console up every time.\n\n139\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:02.670\nLet's just say we have a situation\nwhere we want to sandbox a browser.\n\n140\n00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.780\nSo that's a concern of\nyours because let's look at\n\n141\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.645\nthe issues we have with web browsers and\nwhy you might want to do this.\n\n142\n00:09:11.645 --> 00:09:16.765\nIs you look at a web browser,\na web browser by its very\n\n143\n00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:22.623\nnature you have something on your system\nthat's opening up into an untrusted area,\n\n144\n00:09:22.623 --> 00:09:24.905\nbeing the Internet.\n\n145\n00:09:24.905 --> 00:09:27.945\nAnd then you are taking content\nfrom that untrusted area,\n\n146\n00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:30.540\nbringing it down to that system and\nrunning it locally.\n\n147\n00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.670\nAnd, just think about that,\n\n148\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:38.170\nyou're taking stuff from your trusted area\nout in untrusted and bringing it down.\n\n149\n00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.180\nSo you're opening a conduit directly into\nthat and pulling stuff onto the system.\n\n150\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.920\nSo it definitely opens up some doors.\n\n151\n00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.625\n>> Concerns there?\n\n152\n00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:50.930\n>> Yeah, some major security concerns.\n\n153\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.286\nSo you want to do something to\nkind of stem the tide of that.\n\n154\n00:09:55.286 --> 00:09:59.180\nSo what you could do is,\nif your browser doesn't support it,\n\n155\n00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.110\nyou can use this to support that ability.\n\n156\n00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.140\nAnd so, and then interestingly enough,\njust kind of a side note to this, you\n\n157\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.620\nlook at the name of it, called Sandboxie,\nand you look at the way it's spelled.\n\n158\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.170\nI mean that was actually,\n\n159\n00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.310\nthat I-E was actually a separate\nthing at the end for a while.\n\n160\n00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.540\nThe people originally created this for\n\n161\n00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.970\nInternet Explorer to isolate Internet\nExplorer before they implemented that\n\n162\n00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.940\nsandboxing model in Vista,\nthey had that around.\n\n163\n00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.529\nSo this was a way of providing\nthat security but they long\n\n164\n00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:36.000\nsince realized that, hey,\nthis is a good idea.\n\n165\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.020\nThis is a pretty good product, pretty\nsimple product, and we'll just let it so\n\n166\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.745\nit could be used with all\nthese other things too.\n\n167\n00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:45.955\nAnd so,\nreally cool that they gave us that.\n\n168\n00:10:45.955 --> 00:10:51.925\nIn fact, on my system here,\nI've got a couple browsers on it.\n\n169\n00:10:51.925 --> 00:10:56.455\nYou can see I've got Chrome and\nI've got Firefox down there at the bottom.\n\n170\n00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:58.129\nI do not have IE on this system.\n\n171\n00:10:58.129 --> 00:10:59.498\n>> You're missing Internet Explorer, yeah.\n\n172\n00:10:59.498 --> 00:11:01.964\n>> Yeah, I hunted it down and killed it.\n\n173\n00:11:01.964 --> 00:11:04.166\nI do not like Internet Explorer.\n\n174\n00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:08.152\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And honestly,\n\n175\n00:11:08.152 --> 00:11:14.510\nit's not a Microsoft bashing thing,\nit's just not my preferred browser.\n\n176\n00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.608\nAnd so, I just figured,\nI tend to use Chrome and\n\n177\n00:11:18.608 --> 00:11:23.539\nI tend to use Firefox as my\nmain browsers most of the time.\n\n178\n00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:27.308\nI'll just clear the space\nthat IE is using since it\n\n179\n00:11:27.308 --> 00:11:30.460\nwas just sitting there collecting dust.\n\n180\n00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:35.480\nIt wasn't a specific security concern or\nany hatred of Microsoft that did it.\n\n181\n00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.900\nI just wanna [LAUGH] make that clear.\n\n182\n00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.730\nI uninstalled it because I just\ndidn't need it, so get rid of it.\n\n183\n00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.500\nIt goes to that whole thing\nwe talked about yesterday,\n\n184\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.290\nby the way too, of hardening.\n\n185\n00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.490\nI don't need it there, I have the ability\nto remove it, so I got it out of there.\n\n186\n00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.350\nThat's kinda that thought process, too.\n\n187\n00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:59.530\nAll right, so we got Sandboxie up here,\nI got the sandbox defaults.\n\n188\n00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:06.335\nWhat I can do is, I can right-click on\nthis, and it says okay, Run Sandbox.\n\n189\n00:12:06.335 --> 00:12:12.305\nWell, here t's got some stuff set up for\nyou by default.\n\n190\n00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:15.455\nYou see the web browser, email reader,\nyou can choose your program,\n\n191\n00:12:15.455 --> 00:12:19.595\nyou can go to Start menu, or you can open\nup Windows Explorer and go through that.\n\n192\n00:12:19.595 --> 00:12:22.655\nIt will sandbox all sorts\nof combinations of things.\n\n193\n00:12:22.655 --> 00:12:26.800\nIf you go to the web browser and\nI click on it, you can see in here,\n\n194\n00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.480\nit's starting in that Sandbox.\n\n195\n00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.240\nIt started up Firefox, you can see\nthere's some other stuff going on there.\n\n196\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.380\nI don't need to have that console running,\nby the way.\n\n197\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.648\nThat console can be minimized.\n\n198\n00:12:36.648 --> 00:12:41.130\nThat's really, I opened it up for your\nbenefit, so you can see what Sandboxie,\n\n199\n00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.800\nthe application looks like.\n\n200\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.530\nYou can see over here that\nI've got a minimized version,\n\n201\n00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:51.250\nso you can see it popping up\nwhy I've got Sandboxie up.\n\n202\n00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.915\nYou can see that the browser did indeed\nstart, that browser is sandboxed.\n\n203\n00:12:54.915 --> 00:12:58.500\nThat's not something that\nFirefox does on its own.\n\n204\n00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.240\nIt's something that Sandboxie\nhas put that wrapper around it.\n\n205\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.930\nWhat's really neat about this is that if\nthere's a question in your mind of whether\n\n206\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:11.190\nor not that's actually a sandbox or not,\nlook, I've hovered over it for a second.\n\n207\n00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.970\nAnd it drew that little yellow\nborder around it saying, by the way,\n\n208\n00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:20.330\nthis is not running the normal way,\nthis has been sandboxed.\n\n209\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.020\nSo I've got something\nthere that's sandboxed.\n\n210\n00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:30.430\nSo I can just go ahead and use it, there's\nnothing special I gotta do at this point.\n\n211\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.540\nI went ahead and ran the browser.\n\n212\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.430\nI can go in and start just use it like\nI always have, nothing I gotta do.\n\n213\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.980\nIf I save files and\nstuff like that on there,\n\n214\n00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:46.790\nthen that is something that you do have\nto take a little bit of consideration of.\n\n215\n00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:50.610\nAnything I do inside that sandbox,\ndownloading files,\n\n216\n00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.960\nthey will be saved to that sandbox.\n\n217\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.420\nYou kill the sandbox,\nthose files are going bye bye.\n\n218\n00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.950\nThat's what you want.\n\n219\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.730\nYou don't want that stuff\nbeing saved on the system cuz\n\n220\n00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.080\nthat would defeat the whole\npurpose of doing this.\n\n221\n00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.035\nBut that begs the question,\nwhat do you do if you want those files,\n\n222\n00:14:07.035 --> 00:14:11.880\nif you've saved something, and presumably\nyou've saved your system for a reason.\n\n223\n00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:18.250\nYou can, when you go through this,\nit has the ability to go through and\n\n224\n00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.550\nview the contents of each\nindividual application.\n\n225\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.560\nSo you do have the ability to go through\nthe menus, depending what application\n\n226\n00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.020\nyou're talking about, and say okay, or\njust right-click on the application.\n\n227\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.880\nAnd saying, I wanna go and\ndrag those files out of there.\n\n228\n00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.753\nYou could say,\nokay they're clear, I trust them.\n\n229\n00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:41.609\nYou can just say okay, grab that file and\ndrag it onto your desktop and\n\n230\n00:14:41.609 --> 00:14:44.640\nyou're done, you've got what you need.\n\n231\n00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.025\nSo it's really, really neat and\nreally, really powerful.\n\n232\n00:14:49.025 --> 00:14:53.955\nAnd you can even, in here, if I were\nto right-click on this default sandbox,\n\n233\n00:14:53.955 --> 00:14:58.785\nwhat would happen is it would, and\nsay start another application,\n\n234\n00:14:58.785 --> 00:15:01.962\nit would start another\napplication that sandbox.\n\n235\n00:15:01.962 --> 00:15:05.492\nRemember what I was talking\nabout with Sandboxie,\n\n236\n00:15:05.492 --> 00:15:10.572\none of the benefits you can reap from\nit is, let's just say for kicks I\n\n237\n00:15:10.572 --> 00:15:15.022\nhad a couple applications I wanted to run\nthat were on different security levels.\n\n238\n00:15:15.022 --> 00:15:18.993\nSo one's processing high security stuff,\none's processing lower security stuff.\n\n239\n00:15:18.993 --> 00:15:23.847\nWell, I want to make sure when I'm\nrunning those that these two things don't\n\n240\n00:15:23.847 --> 00:15:29.270\ncross paths, because they're processing\nstuff at different context levels.\n\n241\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.740\nI don't want them interfering.\n\n242\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.520\nWell, running them in the same sandbox\njust shoots that whole process in\n\n243\n00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.380\nthe foot,\nthat's not gonna be helpful to you.\n\n244\n00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.364\nWhat you can do is you\ncan go through here and\n\n245\n00:15:42.364 --> 00:15:49.685\ncreate new sandboxes with their own\nsettings as much as you want to configure.\n\n246\n00:15:49.685 --> 00:15:53.491\nAnd then just take those applications,\nassign it to that other sandbox.\n\n247\n00:15:53.491 --> 00:15:54.989\nAnd you only have to do that once.\n\n248\n00:15:54.989 --> 00:16:00.270\nAssign it over there, and once you've done\nthat, start the application over there.\n\n249\n00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.050\nThey've been compartmentalized\nunder their own boxes.\n\n250\n00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.930\nSo, you can start one over here,\nand one over here.\n\n251\n00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.920\nThey will run the same desktop.\n\n252\n00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.940\nLook like normal, act like normal,\ndo everything you would expect them to.\n\n253\n00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.810\nExcept behind the scenes, they have\nbeen put in their own corners, and\n\n254\n00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.740\nthey don't touch in any way,\nshape, or form.\n\n255\n00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.740\nThe only way they would do that is if\nyou both ran them on the desktop without\n\n256\n00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:28.520\nSandboxie, or if you ran them\nin the same sandbox themselves.\n\n257\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.110\nAnd you can pretty much have,\nas far as I know,\n\n258\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:35.950\nI've never had to push it,\nsomething like this to any sort of limit.\n\n259\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:40.170\nAs far as I understand, you can\nhave as many sandboxes as you want.\n\n260\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.190\nAnd you can have all sorts of combinations\nand do all that good stuff with it.\n\n261\n00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:47.790\nI mean, you might choose to isolate just\na couple applications from one another.\n\n262\n00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.720\nOr isolate an application\nfrom everything else.\n\n263\n00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.550\nYou can group them in different ways.\n\n264\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.840\nYou can have a sandbox that has,\n\n265\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.230\nall the stuff that has,\none common security rating.\n\n266\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.520\nYou can throw them in one thing and then,\n\n267\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.490\nyou can have another one that\nhas everything else, and\n\n268\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:03.640\nhas another security rating.\n\n269\n00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.700\nI mean,\nyou can get really creative with this, but\n\n270\n00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:12.250\nthe thing being that,\nyou can really lock down and say.\n\n271\n00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.210\nAnd lock down and\nprotect access between applications.\n\n272\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.090\nAnd keep these things from maybe\ntouching or having any problems.\n\n273\n00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:23.040\nI think it's just a really\nfantastic way to do stuff.\n\n274\n00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:29.410\nI happen to like Sandboxie, but\nthere are other ones that do this.\n\n275\n00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.940\nIf you want, try Sandboxie and,\nI can't think of the URL for it right now.\n\n276\n00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.880\n>> I've got it right here.\n\n277\n00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.810\nI'll put it our there for them.\n\n278\n00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.450\n>> Yeah, Sandboxie, you can grab that.\n\n279\n00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:44.150\nThere is a kind of a demo\nslash trial version.\n\n280\n00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:50.670\nThat's why I've got here and\nthen they have like single user, and\n\n281\n00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:56.530\neven enterprise user versions of it, if\nyou choose to use it at those levels so.\n\n282\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.010\nI would encourage you, yes.\n\n283\n00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.940\nEspecially there's, I think we even have\na home version too that's completely free\n\n284\n00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.250\nif you choose to use it there,\nso you might try it.\n\n285\n00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.840\nI wouldn't encourage,\nhey it's something that you like.\n\n286\n00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.210\nI knew you can you and\nyou like in the homing environment.\n\n287\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.660\nIt's really great for an enterprise\nenvironment too under certain situation.\n\n288\n00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.640\nAnd so, take a look.\n\n289\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.670\nIt might be something that is worth you,\n\n290\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:28.060\nto spend the money on for your business,\nin providing an extra layer of protection.\n\n291\n00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.010\n>> You have the ability to do some of the\ntesting of those applications that we were\n\n292\n00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:34.310\ntalking about in previous\nepisodes as well.\n\n293\n00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.120\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n294\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:42.250\nAbsolutely a way to do that to really\nprotect yourself and wrap things up.\n\n295\n00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.730\nAnd like I said, there's other\nones out there, that do this.\n\n296\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:50.960\nI've just found that Sandboxie tends to\nbe one of the easiest ways to implement\n\n297\n00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:56.660\nSandboxing on a system and to reap all\nthe benefits that go with it, so yeah,\n\n298\n00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:02.060\ncheck it out, but the underlying cons,\nno matter what you use, is still the same.\n\n299\n00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:08.510\nSandboxing is a way of isolating or\ncontrolling access to resources,\n\n300\n00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:13.410\nand limiting the access of applications in\nwhat they can do, so you don't have this,\n\n301\n00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.100\nthis spread of things or\nthis interference or anything like that.\n\n302\n00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.860\n>> All right, well Sean a lot of good\ninfo there on how we can you know,\n\n303\n00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.850\nsafely, if I can say that,\nsafely test applications, and\n\n304\n00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.370\nmaybe you're downloading an application,\n\n305\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.210\nor you're thinking about putting\nan application as part of your image.\n\n306\n00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.740\nYou wanna test it first and\nsee what it does.\n\n307\n00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.270\nNow you got a way to isolate\nit from everything else,\n\n308\n00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.920\nand see exactly what it's doing\nwithout putting your systems at risk.\n\n309\n00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.850\n>> Yeah, I like that you brought that up\nbecause that's a very good point that I\n\n310\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.867\nneglected [LAUGH] to bring up.\n\n311\n00:19:43.867 --> 00:19:46.390\nI mean is there's that,\n\n312\n00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:51.210\nthis is a good way to test a lot of\nthe stuff that we've been talking about.\n\n313\n00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.590\nIt's not going to be 100% in every case.\n\n314\n00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.620\nSome of that stuff just isn't going to be\nsuited to doing a Sandbox environment.\n\n315\n00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.960\nBut it's definitely not a bad idea to\ntry it within that Sandbox environment,\n\n316\n00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.050\nto see maybe this is ideal.\n\n317\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:11.360\nBut at the end of the day, hey, you may\nhave to go and do a full virtual system,\n\n318\n00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.730\nor you may not even be able to do virtual.\n\n319\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.920\nYou may have to get a physical\nbox to put this on.\n\n320\n00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.960\nBecause there's some things that we have\nin the testing and security world that\n\n321\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:25.280\njust are not gonna work unless\ntheir physically on a box period.\n\n322\n00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.230\nBut for\ntesting a good number of things yeah,\n\n323\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:33.960\nthis would be an awesome thing to use for\nthat without having to,\n\n324\n00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:39.130\nI love virtualization as much as the next\nperson does, and I know the benefits\n\n325\n00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:43.700\nof it, but virtualization does seem\nnow and then to have its quirks, and\n\n326\n00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.890\neven those things aside,\nstill it's still kind of a resource hog.\n\n327\n00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.720\n>> That was a lot easier than\nspinning up a new machine,\n\n328\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.400\nand getting that application\ninstalled on there, and trying to\n\n329\n00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.840\nisolate that virtual machine, so I can\ndefinitely see the usefulness of that.\n\n330\n00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.170\n>> Absolutely.\n\n331\n00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.880\nAlright well a lot of\ngood info there Sean.\n\n332\n00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.310\nAnything else we need to talk\nabout when it comes to Sandboxing?\n\n333\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.160\n>> Not really.\n\n334\n00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.390\nI think we've covered\nwhat the points were.\n\n335\n00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.440\nYou can see it's actually\na pretty simple concept, I think.\n\n336\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.460\nAnd you saw really quickly how to\nuse an application to isolate stuff.\n\n337\n00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:24.780\nSo if you got that down, what Sandboxing\nis, and and what it looks like,\n\n338\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.960\nand you're good, you're good, it's just\na question of how you're gonna do it, and\n\n339\n00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.300\nthis can be done in code, by the way,\nyou don't have to do it this way.\n\n340\n00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.690\nThere's ways to write code\nin certain languages, and\n\n341\n00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.190\nstuff like that that they provide that for\nyou, such as Java.\n\n342\n00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.980\nSo that, it's not just limited to doing it\nlike this, you can do it other ways too.\n\n343\n00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.780\n>> Very good, all right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, that's gonna do it for\n\n344\n00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.370\nthis episode.\n\n345\n00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.670\nHope you enjoyed watching.\n\n346\n00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.940\nSigning off for ITProTV,

00:00:13.966\nI'm your host Mike Broderick.\n\n4\n00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.855\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:16.960\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.390\nI am doing pretty good, how are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.540\n>> Cannot complain.\n\n8\n00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.190\nExcited to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.270\nWe've got another exciting episode.\n\n10\n00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.660\nLots of excitement going\non as you can tell,\n\n11\n00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.550\nwith our CompTia Advanced\nSecurity Practitioner series.\n\n12\n00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.194\nIn this one we're gonna be talking\nabout Application security\n\n13\n00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:34.330\nframework, that's a mouth full.\n\n14\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.859\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.136\n>> I don't even know what I'm saying.\n\n16\n00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.413\nWhat the heck am I saying?\n\n17\n00:00:37.413 --> 00:00:38.133\n>> That makes two of us.\n\n18\n00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:42.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So for\n\n19\n00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.535\nthe next 30 minutes,\nwe're going to do shadow puppets.\n\n20\n00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:49.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What we're talking about here\n\n21\n00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.240\nwhen we talk about application\nsecurity frameworks.\n\n22\n00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.940\nFirst of all, this can be a little bit of\n\n23\n00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.620\na messy area is kinda\nthe way I look at it.\n\n24\n00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.659\nAnd I think it comes from other\nsecurity work that I do and\n\n25\n00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.745\nthen you talk about\nthis application stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:13.782\nThe application security framework we're\ntalking about here is really just a way\n\n27\n00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:18.607\nof creating software, testing software,\nand putting it through its paces.\n\n28\n00:01:18.607 --> 00:01:23.722\nThat type of stuff before\nit leaves the cradle and\n\n29\n00:01:23.722 --> 00:01:30.810\ngoes into the big,\nwide world as a full fledged application.\n\n30\n00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.350\nYou can sometimes have issues\nwith this when you look at\n\n31\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.670\nthe term framework that's used a lot.\n\n32\n00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.530\nYou look at Metasploit.\n\n33\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.770\nMetasploit itself is\nconsidered a framework.\n\n34\n00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.076\nBut it's not designed to be\na development platform at all.\n\n35\n00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:53.260\nIt's designed to be something that's for\ntesting and looking for vulnerabilities,\n\n36\n00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.100\nthat's what it does and\nit does that very very well, we also have,\n\n37\n00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.540\nI've gotten my hack phone,\nI guess that's what you call it,\n\n38\n00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.570\nI've got over there, on that one I\nhave a Adroit security framework.\n\n39\n00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.540\nIt doesn't do application development over\nthere either, it has a bunch of testing\n\n40\n00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.940\ntools in there, so there's a bunch\nof ways that use this term.\n\n41\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.980\nFor here, just to make sure we're\nsetting the stage correctly on it,\n\n42\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.435\nand since we have at least talked about\none of those in the past with Metasploit.\n\n43\n00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:28.830\nAnd notice we were talking about\nMetasploit, when we talked about it,\n\n44\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.080\nwe never we didn't really call it\nthe Metasploit security framework.\n\n45\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.530\nBut if you actually look at the console,\nand if you go back and look at those shows\n\n46\n00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.050\nyou'll notice that the prompt for\nit says MSF, there's MSF console.\n\n47\n00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.750\nIt's Metasploits security framework.\n\n48\n00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.370\nJust no one calls it the whole security\nframework unless they're using\n\n49\n00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.410\nthe official title.\n\n50\n00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.550\n>> Now we know why the logon is MSSF now.\n\n51\n00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.380\n>> Exactly.\n\n52\n00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.520\nThat's where that comes from.\n\n53\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.670\nAnd developers do use that\nas one of their tools\n\n54\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.710\nduring this process that we're gonna\nbe going over and talking about.\n\n55\n00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.730\nBut it's used in other areas too.\n\n56\n00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.790\nWe used it very clearly for pen testing.\n\n57\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.420\nThey used it for the same thing,\nbut to evaluate and kick holes and\n\n58\n00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.700\nmess with their applications.\n\n59\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.230\nSo with that being said we could move\non to what that those frameworks\n\n60\n00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.374\nactually mean, or life cycles as\nsometimes they call it to mean\n\n61\n00:03:22.374 --> 00:03:27.929\nto us as far as application developers\nfrom a security standpoint.\n\n62\n00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:31.155\n>> Okay, sounds good to me\n>> So,\n\n63\n00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:36.495\nwhat we're looking at is before\nwe start looking at specifically\n\n64\n00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:41.710\nat any examples when we talk about\na security framework or a life cycle,\n\n65\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.720\nwe are talking about using a structured\n\n66\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.670\nprocess to go through the development\ncycle of an application and\n\n67\n00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.100\nmake sure that things are being done and\nbeing handled the way they should.\n\n68\n00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.540\nIt's different than just saying\nhey you know plan the thing out,\n\n69\n00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.543\nyou know get behind the console,\nstart coding and then release it when you\n\n70\n00:04:06.543 --> 00:04:12.053\nthink you got something that meets the\nrequirements that you've put out there.\n\n71\n00:04:12.053 --> 00:04:14.290\nSo what we're trying to do is\nwe're trying to avoid that and\n\n72\n00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.590\nwe're trying to say let's\nput a structure in place.\n\n73\n00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.690\nIf you don't put a structure in\nplace at least of some sort.\n\n74\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.090\nWhat's gonna happen is you're gonna, more\nlikely, on the larger projects or as they\n\n75\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.410\nscale larger and larger, you're gonna\nget to a point where it becomes a mess.\n\n76\n00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.560\nIt just doesn't work, or\nit becomes very tough to manage, so\n\n77\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.550\nwe're trying to avoid that, make something\nthat can scale up to an enterprise\n\n78\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.150\nproject, even, and still retain certain\nlevels of quality and performance.\n\n79\n00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.900\nAnd we're going to the checklist, too.\n\n80\n00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.461\nWith that being said, just to kind\nof throw out the different types of\n\n81\n00:04:52.461 --> 00:04:55.455\nframeworks or\nlife cycles that are out there,\n\n82\n00:04:55.455 --> 00:05:01.210\nthere's a lot of them just to be quite\nblunt about it there's a lot of them.\n\n83\n00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:08.180\nMicrosoft has theirs, it has what they've\ncome up that is, it works pretty well.\n\n84\n00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.280\nThere's also other of ones that\nreside out in the wild that are used.\n\n85\n00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.480\nYou know, they've got an agile\ndevelopment life cycle,\n\n86\n00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.170\nthey have like a version of life cycle,\nof life cycle management and\n\n87\n00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.270\nframeworks, called Extreme Programming.\n\n88\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.090\nYou still see that one.\n\n89\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.464\nExtreme Programming, for example,\nis one where the whole software\n\n90\n00:05:36.464 --> 00:05:41.744\ndevelopment process is centered\naround having a very small team and\n\n91\n00:05:41.744 --> 00:05:47.320\nthat team does planning, development,\nQA, and all that in one shot.\n\n92\n00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.990\nIt's a small team they can adapt to,\nthey can very quickly and\n\n93\n00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.982\nhopefully very effectively\ndeal with problems.\n\n94\n00:05:53.982 --> 00:05:59.820\nAnd so\nthey've used that in some situations but\n\n95\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.850\nthat one like any of these\nmodels does its drawbacks.\n\n96\n00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.830\nIf you look at Extreme Programming,\n\n97\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.760\nkeeping that very small team\nworking on things, sounds great.\n\n98\n00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.580\nEverything's kept all in the family, and\nthey can go through stuff quite rapidly\n\n99\n00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.730\nand address problems and cover problems\nand make changes and go right on through.\n\n100\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.270\nGreat, like to hear that,\nbecause it means from\n\n101\n00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.150\na very real standpoint that I\ncan get this thing out quicker.\n\n102\n00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.590\nHowever, everything is\nbeing done in the family.\n\n103\n00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.360\nAmongst that one team, so the chances of\nsomething not being evaluated in a truly\n\n104\n00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.420\nobjective manner definitely exist so\nthat would be a big drawback there.\n\n105\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.430\n>> Yeah, cuz I mean, obviously if I'm\nworking on that project I'm a little\n\n106\n00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.330\nbiased and I might not test it\nas thoroughly as I should or\n\n107\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.259\nmight not report some of\nmy findings that I should.\n\n108\n00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:57.100\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah you definitely hit\n\n109\n00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.240\nthe right the nail on the head,\nyou're gonna be biased towards it.\n\n110\n00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.190\nActually, I used to joke around\nwith some of my programmer friends\n\n111\n00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.000\nwhen I was talking about this and\nother security people.\n\n112\n00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.710\nI said having someone evaluate their\nown security or own program or\n\n113\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.310\nwhat have you, there's no way they're\ngoing to be, no matter how hard they try,\n\n114\n00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.300\nthey're not going to be unbiased and\nbe objective.\n\n115\n00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.010\nIt's just like when someone shows you, you\nshow someone your kid's baby picture like,\n\n116\n00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.908\noh look how cute it is.\n\n117\n00:07:23.908 --> 00:07:26.250\nYou're like [LAUGH] someone\ncrawled in that crib,\n\n118\n00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.120\nit ain't that kid cuz that's not a kid.\n\n119\n00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.110\nThat's a sasquatch or\n\n120\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.860\nsomething man, it's like-\n>> And definitely there could be I might\n\n121\n00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.980\nhave deadlines that I get penalized if I\ndon't reach or, you know, I wanna get this\n\n122\n00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.450\nproduct out the door, so I've got reasons\nto maybe not be so honest with my results.\n\n123\n00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.840\n>> Yeah, and it's not to say it doesn't,\n\n124\n00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.730\nit's not to say that\nthis system won't work,\n\n125\n00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.319\nit's just to say that you\nhave to realize that there's\n\n126\n00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:02.031\na potential problem there\nthat you may have to address.\n\n127\n00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:06.689\nWell that being said, I guess what\nwe can do is we can move into talk\n\n128\n00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:11.460\nabout Microsoft's model,\nwhich would be one of the bigger ones.\n\n129\n00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.735\nIt's also one of the ones\nthat will be tested on and\n\n130\n00:08:16.735 --> 00:08:20.345\nasked questions about in the exam, so\nI'm just kinda throwing that out there.\n\n131\n00:08:20.345 --> 00:08:21.095\n>> Hint, hint.\n\n132\n00:08:21.095 --> 00:08:24.675\n>> Yeah, doing a little bit\nof foot stomping there, so\n\n133\n00:08:24.675 --> 00:08:28.525\nto speak, and\nlooks at the reason for that is,\n\n134\n00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:34.200\nit's not to say that those other models\naren't important and don't exist.\n\n135\n00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.770\nIt's just that in this case,\nthis one we do know is on there.\n\n136\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.110\nAnd it's something that you\nwill get quizzed about, and\n\n137\n00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.130\ndo have to have an awareness of.\n\n138\n00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.520\nYou may never end up using the SDLC for\nMicrosoft, you might use another one.\n\n139\n00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.370\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n140\n00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.530\nYou may even develop your own process.\n\n141\n00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:54.420\nI've seen that, too.\n\n142\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.310\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n143\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.100\nThat's the way the real world works\nis that you use what's appropriate.\n\n144\n00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.710\nWe don't want to muddy the waters\nwith too much confusion,\n\n145\n00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:09.310\nby covering all those one\nwhen it's not necessary.\n\n146\n00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:14.420\nWe're just going to give you an awareness\nof it, that those ones are out there.\n\n147\n00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.650\nYou can seek those ones out once you\nunderstand the concept behind why\n\n148\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.890\nyou would have that.\n\n149\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:23.770\nAnd then, or\nonce we've got that down we can just look\n\n150\n00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:29.420\nat the SDLC briefly and\nsee what that does for\n\n151\n00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.810\nus and maybe get a better understanding of\nall of them in the process, I would think.\n\n152\n00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.100\n>> Fantastic, I like that idea.\n\n153\n00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:41.229\n>> All right, so what I've done\ninstead of just going through and\n\n154\n00:09:41.229 --> 00:09:47.149\nyakking about it, what I did is I\nbrought up Microsoft's website on this.\n\n155\n00:09:47.149 --> 00:09:52.954\nIn Microsoft you can actually Google,\noh sorry it's Microsoft, you gotta Bing.\n\n156\n00:09:52.954 --> 00:09:55.076\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> So\n\n157\n00:09:55.076 --> 00:09:58.770\nGoogle Bing then search\nfrom Bing to find this.\n\n158\n00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:04.229\nBut Microsoft's SDLC, they've got their\n\n159\n00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:09.695\nown documents on this\nthat goes through it.\n\n160\n00:10:09.695 --> 00:10:13.781\nAnd it's pretty much similar\nto some of the other\n\n161\n00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:18.300\nmodels you'll see that also\ncall themselves SDLCs.\n\n162\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.000\nWhat we have here is you can see\nthat they have the actual phases,\n\n163\n00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.530\nthings that they expect you have coming\nin, which isn't a bad idea by the way.\n\n164\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.760\nTo make sure everyone's on the same\npage before they go into the cycle and\n\n165\n00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.490\nstart interacting as a team, what you\nwant to do is make sure that they're all\n\n166\n00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.030\nspeaking the same language and\nusing the same terms.\n\n167\n00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.450\nIf they don't,\nyou could end up with a big problem there.\n\n168\n00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.500\nAnd we talked about that and other things\nlike forensics and stuff like that.\n\n169\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:52.395\nThe value of being on the same page,\nit can really be the difference between,\n\n170\n00:10:52.395 --> 00:10:54.595\nit won't be as dramatic as saying life and\ndeath but\n\n171\n00:10:54.595 --> 00:10:57.975\nit can be the difference\nbetween success and failure.\n\n172\n00:10:57.975 --> 00:11:00.265\nIt doesn't take much.\n\n173\n00:11:00.265 --> 00:11:04.115\nBut the SDLC process, you can see they've\n\n174\n00:11:04.115 --> 00:11:08.905\nvery clearly broken it\ndown into five phases.\n\n175\n00:11:08.905 --> 00:11:12.265\nAnd then they have the stuff coming in\nthat they expected to have training and\n\n176\n00:11:12.265 --> 00:11:13.540\nknowledge wise.\n\n177\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:19.590\nAnd then stuff that they have after your\nrelease just in case problems come up,\n\n178\n00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.540\nand quite frankly,\nit's not just in case they will come up.\n\n179\n00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.470\nIt's just how you're going to deal\nwith them when they get there.\n\n180\n00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.300\nSo they go through and\nthey spell all this stuff out.\n\n181\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.290\nThey tell you what type of\ntraining they expect you to have.\n\n182\n00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:38.800\nThis is something that really, if you're\ngoing to be doing secure programming,\n\n183\n00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.320\ndo it the proper way, you really need\nto have your developers introduced\n\n184\n00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.450\nto the basic security concepts.\n\n185\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.740\nThat's been something that,\nfor a long time, was lacking.\n\n186\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.520\nIt led to problems.\n\n187\n00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.350\nIt definitely led to problems,\nbecause you have the developers going and\n\n188\n00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.140\nconcentrating on just writing the code.\n\n189\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:07.180\nI'm not going to sit here and pick on,\nwas the code good or was it bad.\n\n190\n00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:12.520\nThat's just where their focus was,\nso they had that.\n\n191\n00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.130\nBut they weren't necessarily\nhaving too much of emphasis on\n\n192\n00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.760\nthe secure coding part, aspect.\n\n193\n00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.790\nThere wasn't a lot of guidance on it.\n\n194\n00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.810\nThe guidance that was out there\nwasn't as necessarily emphasized.\n\n195\n00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.401\nYou could take a programming classes or\npick up a book and they would give you\n\n196\n00:12:28.401 --> 00:12:32.221\nlike a short chapter on and usually just\none chapter and a short chapter at that.\n\n197\n00:12:32.221 --> 00:12:36.378\nThey would say, basically, by the way\nsecure a code and do this stuff.\n\n198\n00:12:36.378 --> 00:12:37.475\nOkay, you good?\n\n199\n00:12:37.475 --> 00:12:38.365\nAll right, good.\nWe'll go ahead and\n\n200\n00:12:38.365 --> 00:12:39.409\ntalk about some more stuff.\n\n201\n00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.690\nThat's a good start.\n\n202\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.420\nIt's not the end all do all of it,\nnor should it be.\n\n203\n00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.730\nIn fact I remember when\nVista was getting developed,\n\n204\n00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:56.230\none of the things that Microsoft did\nwas they actually stopped development\n\n205\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:01.038\nof that product for\nnot a substantial period of time, but\n\n206\n00:13:01.038 --> 00:13:06.560\nit was a good period of\ntime to be noticeable.\n\n207\n00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.120\nAnd they did it because they said,\nyou know what, we want to address it.\n\n208\n00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.040\nWe want to make sure secure coding and\n\n209\n00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.840\nsecure programming is being obeyed,\nand everyone's aware of it.\n\n210\n00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.920\nSo let's make sure if we're going to make\na secure product and a safe product,\n\n211\n00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.000\nlet's take our developers and\nstart sending them out to security trains.\n\n212\n00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.110\nSo they would actually stop development\non major projects to the whole team and\n\n213\n00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.650\nsaid you're going to training and\nhad them taught secure coding\n\n214\n00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:40.300\npractices by someone that was,\nor individuals that were\n\n215\n00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.660\nexperts in that side of things to make\nsure that they were actually doing that.\n\n216\n00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:51.000\nAnd you did see, you did start seeing\na ramping up of the security in there.\n\n217\n00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.688\nAnd I know we could make\njokes about Vista and\n\n218\n00:13:52.688 --> 00:13:54.920\neveryone pretty much has\nwe've all heard them.\n\n219\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:00.790\nBut, there was definitely a ramping\nup of the secure code and\n\n220\n00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:04.040\nstuff like that, some behind\nthe scenes that not everyone sees.\n\n221\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.320\nThere was a ramping up of that,\nand that had increased.\n\n222\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.195\nSo before they started going,\n\n223\n00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:12.740\nyou're really going into revamping\na lot of the development processes and\n\n224\n00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.920\nall that, they made sure everyone\nhad exposure and knowledge of what\n\n225\n00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.563\nsecure development practices were to\nmake sure those were being followed.\n\n226\n00:14:21.563 --> 00:14:25.486\nSo that was a big plus on there.\n\n227\n00:14:25.486 --> 00:14:29.210\nSo, yeah, Vista came out and\nthey had issues with it, but\n\n228\n00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.350\nthere was other things going on.\n\n229\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.016\nAnd I'm not trying to make excuses for it,\n\n230\n00:14:33.016 --> 00:14:35.240\nbut, yeah,\nthat was something that they did.\n\n231\n00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.610\nAnd during that, it didn't get much\nattention called to it, but it did happen.\n\n232\n00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:44.440\nSo you can see on here, just to kind\nof if you go to this website and\n\n233\n00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.952\nMike's put that up for you guys.\n\n234\n00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:51.732\nIf you go through it, and\nI'm not going to punch on every\n\n235\n00:14:51.732 --> 00:14:56.738\npoint on this prerequisite training,\nbut you look at it.\n\n236\n00:14:56.738 --> 00:15:00.125\nI mean, kind of look at some of the areas,\nin general,\n\n237\n00:15:00.125 --> 00:15:03.450\nthat a good programmer\nshould have experience with.\n\n238\n00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.980\nSecure design, you look at secure design,\nattack surface reduction,\n\n239\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.620\ndefense and depth,\nleashed privilege, secure defaults.\n\n240\n00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.956\nThat one sounds kinda funny.\n\n241\n00:15:13.956 --> 00:15:15.150\n>> [LAUGH] That's an oxymoron, right?\n\n242\n00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.300\n>> Yeah, secure defaults.\n\n243\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:23.160\nAll right, so, but\nyou look at those, those\n\n244\n00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.820\nare all things that we'll say default for\nthe last one, we won't say secure default.\n\n245\n00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:33.720\nBut we can look at those things and\nsay, what those, really?\n\n246\n00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.080\nThat's nothing new to us.\n\n247\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:36.790\n>> It shouldn't be right?\n\n248\n00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.368\n>> Yeah, it's not something that's new.\n\n249\n00:15:40.368 --> 00:15:45.018\nIt's something that they just weren't\nbeing taught on that side necessarily.\n\n250\n00:15:45.018 --> 00:15:50.319\nNow if you have someone that was\ntrying to stay ahead of the curve and\n\n251\n00:15:50.319 --> 00:15:52.601\nwas in IT and stuff already.\n\n252\n00:15:52.601 --> 00:15:56.995\nAnd doing security and maybe had exposure\nto that, then they would have this, but\n\n253\n00:15:56.995 --> 00:15:59.795\nit wasn't a universal thing\nlike it needed to be, so\n\n254\n00:15:59.795 --> 00:16:04.337\nthat's something that's brought into\nbasic concept, then you threat modeling.\n\n255\n00:16:04.337 --> 00:16:09.331\nThat was them understanding,\nwhat could be coming in and facing,\n\n256\n00:16:09.331 --> 00:16:13.180\nthey didn't really have\nthe best possible thing.\n\n257\n00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.730\nWe knew that about as pen testers and\nstuff like that and\n\n258\n00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.530\npeople that are network designers.\n\n259\n00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.200\nBut they weren't really\nlooking at that on that side.\n\n260\n00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.780\nAnd then you just keep going on and on.\n\n261\n00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.160\nThere's the testing part,\nprivacy, oh hey, look at that.\n\n262\n00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.880\nThey got privacy in there, and they\ntalk about some of the general things,\n\n263\n00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.160\nlike risk analysis,\ntypes of privacy data, best practices.\n\n264\n00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.210\nWell, heck we love to see that, right?\n\n265\n00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.733\n>> Absolutely.\n\n266\n00:16:35.733 --> 00:16:39.580\n>> With today's world,\nyou better have that.\n\n267\n00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.795\nSo there's just some interesting things in\nthis list that they were making sure of,\n\n268\n00:16:42.795 --> 00:16:45.770\nand you can see, look at that for\nsecure coding, look what's on there.\n\n269\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:46.885\nWhat did we just talk about?\n\n270\n00:16:46.885 --> 00:16:47.700\nCross site scripting.\n\n271\n00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.690\nOh look, that's there!\n\n272\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.870\nSQL injections,\nwell we've talked about that and\n\n273\n00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.160\nbeat that into the ground in other places.\n\n274\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.760\nCryptography, well we've talked\nabout that in the first one.\n\n275\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:01.050\nI mean, think about how many people\nyou even know that are working\n\n276\n00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:06.100\nwith cryptographic technologies and they\njust know it's a way of taking this and\n\n277\n00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.230\nscrambling it up and\nputting it out here some other form.\n\n278\n00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.990\nThat's what they think of it as,\nthey don't know the other things.\n\n279\n00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.725\nI'm not saying you need\nto put a lab coat up and\n\n280\n00:17:13.725 --> 00:17:15.660\nstart working on a chalkboard\nto understand it.\n\n281\n00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:21.360\nYou just need to have some understanding,\nand too many people don't have that.\n\n282\n00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.610\nI don't need you to be a mathematician and\nall type of stuff, but\n\n283\n00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.620\nI do need you to have some understanding,\nso\n\n284\n00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:31.960\nyou can identify what's garbage\nfrom what's the good stuff.\n\n285\n00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.833\nSo that was lacking a lot at one point and\nwas actually bumped up.\n\n286\n00:17:36.833 --> 00:17:41.356\nThen you see the advanced stuff in here,\nis that you've got user interface design,\n\n287\n00:17:41.356 --> 00:17:43.280\nstuff that the coders really need.\n\n288\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.580\nYou know,\nthey've got here resources they go to.\n\n289\n00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:50.427\nI mean, hey, if you guys missed it,\nthe guys that are CISSPs,\n\n290\n00:17:50.427 --> 00:17:53.278\nBell-LaPadula and the Biba model.\n\n291\n00:17:53.278 --> 00:17:57.812\nYou may remember those from the CISSP, you\nknow the Bell being the confidentiality\n\n292\n00:17:57.812 --> 00:18:02.560\nand the Biba being the integrity model, so\nthey're hammering those things in there.\n\n293\n00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.670\nThat's one of the few places you'll see\nthat, as I like to say off the CISSP.\n\n294\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.620\nYou know, a lot of people when they do the\nCISSP blowing, when am I gonna use this?\n\n295\n00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.580\nOn the exam, and after that never.\n\n296\n00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:17.854\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you know that's a joke\n\n297\n00:18:17.854 --> 00:18:22.710\non my part, not a good one but\na joke on my part.\n\n298\n00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.610\nBut that's it, it's just kidding around.\n\n299\n00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.540\nThere are places to use it,\nit's just not a everyday thing and\n\n300\n00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.440\nremember the CISSP is something\nthat is just like this one.\n\n301\n00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.030\nThis one, the CASP is getting to be\na broader audience, the management part,\n\n302\n00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.980\ntrying to expose you to different areas.\n\n303\n00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.450\nThe CISSP is going even broader than that,\nand\n\n304\n00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.670\ngiving you even exposure to\na whole bunch of other things.\n\n305\n00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.907\nSo you may not ever use it,\nyou may not ever directly use it, but\n\n306\n00:18:48.907 --> 00:18:50.370\nyou need to know it.\n\n307\n00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.900\nIf I'm managing a software team,\nis being someone that's designing\n\n308\n00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.130\nthe infrastructure and\nneeds something coded or readjusted.\n\n309\n00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.500\nIf they're talking that language,\nI better know it.\n\n310\n00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.650\nMay not use it directly,\nbut I better know it.\n\n311\n00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:01.340\n>> Absolutely.\n\n312\n00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.500\n>> So we all better be speaking the same\nlanguage, that speaks directly to that.\n\n313\n00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.884\nSo, we've got the basics out of the way,\nbut\n\n314\n00:19:08.884 --> 00:19:12.004\nthen you start looking at the other ones,\n\n315\n00:19:12.004 --> 00:19:17.460\nlook at when you do the actual SDLC\nprocess, figuring out what you need.\n\n316\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.710\nI mean look at this.\n\n317\n00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.815\nI don't even need to go through\nthis whole page here, and\n\n318\n00:19:21.815 --> 00:19:23.830\nI'm not gonna beat you up with that.\n\n319\n00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.341\nI'll let you review this on your own,\n\n320\n00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:29.570\nif you want to read every\nlittle detail about it.\n\n321\n00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.623\nBut look at this actual first\nofficial phase of the requirements.\n\n322\n00:19:33.623 --> 00:19:36.566\nThe project inception, security cost,\n\n323\n00:19:36.566 --> 00:19:40.850\ndevelopment support costs,\nall these things go in.\n\n324\n00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:45.154\nWell, heck, the one that's music to my\nears off of that is it's not just hey,\n\n325\n00:19:45.154 --> 00:19:49.526\nwe're gonna go and build an application\ntoday, let's start that journey down\n\n326\n00:19:49.526 --> 00:19:52.750\nthe yellow brick road and\nfigure out what we're gonna do.\n\n327\n00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.450\nNo, they're not just\ntalking about features.\n\n328\n00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:59.550\nRight here they're saying,\nlet's talk about security, right there.\n\n329\n00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.010\nAnd how many times do we have to say it,\n\n330\n00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.680\nthat if you're gonna do security properly,\nyou gotta do it at the beginning.\n\n331\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.186\nAnd so, right there, they say we're\naddressing security requirements right\n\n332\n00:20:10.186 --> 00:20:13.610\nthen and there,\nto make sure that they're being handled.\n\n333\n00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.495\nAnd I like when you get\nto the details of this,\n\n334\n00:20:17.495 --> 00:20:23.731\nthat you can see that it's telling you,\nand maybe we can, just to kind of\n\n335\n00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:29.370\nemphasize one thing in here is if\nwe can zoom up on there just a bit.\n\n336\n00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.657\nYou can see because it's kind of small\nthat there's a section there that says\n\n337\n00:20:32.657 --> 00:20:33.780\nsecurity requirements.\n\n338\n00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:38.340\nI just kind of want to point out something\nkind of briefly there, is what we have is\n\n339\n00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:43.650\nit says, develop a short questionnaire.\n\n340\n00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.584\nThat's something that you saw put out and\nthey mentioned that.\n\n341\n00:20:47.584 --> 00:20:52.822\nGoing for the CISSP they mention that,\nbut it's all something we've\n\n342\n00:20:52.822 --> 00:20:58.236\nmentioned when we do our pen testing\ntoo is to get a questionnaire sent out\n\n343\n00:20:58.236 --> 00:21:03.860\nto ask people what they see as security\nproblems and what things they need.\n\n344\n00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.510\nWe're trying to get a good\npicture from across the board,\n\n345\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.350\nand then mix those all in and say,\nokay, we've got our solution now.\n\n346\n00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.870\nNow, so that's a really good\nthing that we all like to see.\n\n347\n00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.680\nOkay, so you do the requirements,\nspec out the requirements.\n\n348\n00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.430\nOkay, so we talked about the plan,\nwe talked about planning stuff out.\n\n349\n00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:22.560\nThat's what that is.\n\n350\n00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:30.206\nThen we go over to the next\nphase which is doing the design.\n\n351\n00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:33.666\nI think this is actually better\nhaving this all zoomed in like this.\n\n352\n00:21:33.666 --> 00:21:35.375\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I really do\n\n353\n00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:36.416\nnot have the face for TV.\n\n354\n00:21:36.416 --> 00:21:39.876\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And in any case so,\n\n355\n00:21:39.876 --> 00:21:44.238\nin here you talk about the design,\nthis is where you\n\n356\n00:21:44.238 --> 00:21:49.220\nfigured out what your requirements are,\nwhich is great.\n\n357\n00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.540\nWe've got our requirements,\nnow we're moving on.\n\n358\n00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:56.060\nWhat do those requirements, how do they\ntranslate over into something that's\n\n359\n00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:01.290\na little more actionable, you can't really\ndo much just by having requirements.\n\n360\n00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.390\nRequirements aren't enough to\njust go in and start coding.\n\n361\n00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.300\nI mean some people will say yeah,\n\n362\n00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.070\nyou can and I'm not gonna really\nargue with you with that too much,\n\n363\n00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:15.020\ncuz in some cases I mean you guessed you\ncould if you really wanted to do that.\n\n364\n00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.030\nBut we don't have,\nwe're saying at the enterprise level\n\n365\n00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.650\nwhere this would really apply,\nthat we don't have that luxury.\n\n366\n00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.727\nWe've got to really say, let's make sure\nthat we've got all the requirements in and\n\n367\n00:22:25.727 --> 00:22:28.445\nthen we've mushed those and\nall that and worked those and\n\n368\n00:22:28.445 --> 00:22:30.830\nsaid, here's what our\ndesign should look like.\n\n369\n00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:35.752\nYou have documentation, you've got your\nwhite boards, whatever, and say boom,\n\n370\n00:22:35.752 --> 00:22:37.290\nthis what we want to have.\n\n371\n00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.491\nI mean so we're doing that\nwith how those requirements\n\n372\n00:22:41.491 --> 00:22:45.550\ntranslate into features,\nand stuff like that.\n\n373\n00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:50.560\nIn fact, I like to say the design phase\nwould be at the enterprise level.\n\n374\n00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.731\nAt the place I was at we had the very,\nvery high level\n\n375\n00:22:55.731 --> 00:23:00.920\npeople were the people\nlike software architects.\n\n376\n00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.120\nAnd those were guys that had\na knowledge of how coding worked.\n\n377\n00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.127\nThey had moved up through the ranks and\nacquireda lot of knowledge and\n\n378\n00:23:08.127 --> 00:23:11.445\nexperience that now they could\nreally guide a project and\n\n379\n00:23:11.445 --> 00:23:14.788\nthen later on spec out stuff\nbased on what they've seen.\n\n380\n00:23:14.788 --> 00:23:19.400\nOr saw were deficiencies or\nthings that could be\n\n381\n00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.430\nadded to enhance the functionality\nof a product, they have that.\n\n382\n00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.869\nSo when you're talking of requirements and\ndesign,\n\n383\n00:23:24.869 --> 00:23:27.370\nthat's like kind of a software\narchitect type thing.\n\n384\n00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:32.417\nAnd the high level senior programming\nstaff, where they're flushing things out,\n\n385\n00:23:32.417 --> 00:23:36.182\nsaying, okay that wish list item or\nthat feature that we want or\n\n386\n00:23:36.182 --> 00:23:41.040\nthat area we want to address, this is the\nfeature, this is how we take care of it.\n\n387\n00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.627\nAnd then once we have that say,\nthis is what we want,\n\n388\n00:23:44.627 --> 00:23:46.920\nwe want a feature that does this.\n\n389\n00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.878\nAnd they don't tell you specifics,\nthey just tell you,\n\n390\n00:23:50.878 --> 00:23:54.759\nhey this is what we want\na feature to be able to carry out.\n\n391\n00:23:54.759 --> 00:23:57.127\nThen comes the implementation part,\n\n392\n00:23:57.127 --> 00:24:00.531\nthat's Phase 3 as we can see here,\nimplementation,\n\n393\n00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:05.417\nis now saying okay well someone is giving\nyou what they want to see, well boom.\n\n394\n00:24:05.417 --> 00:24:10.560\nIt goes to the programmers and\nit gets chopped up into pieces.\n\n395\n00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.950\nAnd if it's a big enough project\nit's chopped up into pieces and\n\n396\n00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:18.120\nyou translate these into\nactual working features.\n\n397\n00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.780\nSo that's what's happening there.\n\n398\n00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.720\nSo we're moving down the line.\n\n399\n00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.320\nOnce you get that implemented then\nthe verification also known as testing,\n\n400\n00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.050\nI guess is another really\ngood way to put it.\n\n401\n00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.027\nEven though verification\ndoes cover more than that.\n\n402\n00:24:33.027 --> 00:24:37.599\nVerification is testing,\nit's a the Q&A process, and\n\n403\n00:24:37.599 --> 00:24:42.741\neven in some cases it's moving to,\nyou kind of have the alpha and\n\n404\n00:24:42.741 --> 00:24:46.390\npre-alpha phases happening there.\n\n405\n00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:50.130\nIn some cases they even have what\nthey call gunslingers where they have\n\n406\n00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.810\npeople come in from the outside\nwith actual projects and\n\n407\n00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.030\nsee if they can do their\nprojects with your software.\n\n408\n00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:04.220\nI know at the place I was at that did\ncomputer-aided engineering and design,\n\n409\n00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:09.340\nwe had it for a long time and we knew for\na long time that, even though we\n\n410\n00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:15.590\nwere making what the industry perceived as\ngreat software, and it was great software,\n\n411\n00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.110\nit could be done better because the people\nthat designed it were computer nerds.\n\n412\n00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:22.260\nThere's a big difference between a bunch\nof computer nerds that are going, hey,\n\n413\n00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.340\nlook at all the different ways we can draw\nlines and do solid models and all this\n\n414\n00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:30.230\ntype of stuff, to someone that's actually\nan engineer that's not a computer nerd.\n\n415\n00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.960\nYou have the engineer that's\ndesigning an engine for\n\n416\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.160\na car or structure or something.\n\n417\n00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.020\n>> They've got stuff that\nwe as computer nerds and\n\n418\n00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.770\nsoftware development people\ndon't have that experience with.\n\n419\n00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.932\nAnd so doing those sort of things\nintroduces another level of testing where\n\n420\n00:25:46.932 --> 00:25:49.230\nwe would say, oh, we didn't see that.\n\n421\n00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.737\nAnd we've got the person right here\nthat's doing this type of stuff,\n\n422\n00:25:52.737 --> 00:25:56.661\nlet's talk to them about how that feature\ncould be reworked to provide the best\n\n423\n00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:59.350\nfunctionality, the most bang for\nthe buck for them.\n\n424\n00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.450\nBecause we're not designing for\nus, we're designing for\n\n425\n00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:06.087\nthem, so\nthat's where verification also helps out.\n\n426\n00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.470\nAnd so we have that.\n\n427\n00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.960\nI even would point out in\nhere on Microsoft's stuff,\n\n428\n00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.960\nwe don't need to zoom in on that.\n\n429\n00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.040\nThey're specifying right here\none of the areas of concern.\n\n430\n00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.995\nLook at that, confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability.\n\n431\n00:26:20.995 --> 00:26:22.095\n>> I've heard of that somewhere before.\n\n432\n00:26:22.095 --> 00:26:23.525\n>> Yeah, haven't you?\n\n433\n00:26:23.525 --> 00:26:25.124\nIt's right there.\n>> Yeah, the little CIA triad.\n\n434\n00:26:25.124 --> 00:26:27.667\n>> Yeah, they're not making any\nbones about it, it's right there.\n\n435\n00:26:27.667 --> 00:26:31.465\nI mean so, we're seeing these\nworlds start to line up, right?\n\n436\n00:26:31.465 --> 00:26:34.810\nWe have what we've been doing and\nthere's what they've been doing.\n\n437\n00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.650\nWe're starting to see those roads,\nhow they come together.\n\n438\n00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.900\nRemember, this is not, and\nno one works in an island, in a vacuum,\n\n439\n00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.020\nanything like that.\n\n440\n00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.500\nThey all fit together, they need to be\nworking towards the same goals that we\n\n441\n00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:48.480\nare as IT, because that's gonna be in our\nenvironment and we're gonna be in theirs.\n\n442\n00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.970\nAnd then once we verify,\nthen we have the release phase.\n\n443\n00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:57.360\nThe release phase is figuring out how\nyou're gonna get it out to the public,\n\n444\n00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.130\njust how that's gonna start, and\n\n445\n00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:04.910\nthat can be pretty involved\nwhen you get down to it.\n\n446\n00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:10.013\nEspecially when you have large,\nvery large-scale\n\n447\n00:27:10.013 --> 00:27:16.060\nsoftware projects, cuz when you're\ndeveloping the stuff behind the scenes,\n\n448\n00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.210\npeople don't see that and\nit's a much smaller team.\n\n449\n00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:25.795\nYou look at Microsoft's Windows team,\nthat a darn huge development team.\n\n450\n00:27:25.795 --> 00:27:30.985\nHowever, when you compare\nthat to the number of people\n\n451\n00:27:30.985 --> 00:27:34.085\nthat are actually gonna be deploying\nthat in something like Windows 10,\n\n452\n00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:37.615\nI mean, they've said the board and\n\n453\n00:27:37.615 --> 00:27:42.995\nthe CEO of Microsoft says they wanna have\nit on what, a billion user desktops?\n\n454\n00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:45.480\nThat's what they're shooting for.\n\n455\n00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:50.505\nAnd so if that's the case, a billion\nversus whatever their number is in\n\n456\n00:27:50.505 --> 00:27:56.055\nMicrosoft that develops Windows, hey,\nocean, meet the drop in the bucket.\n\n457\n00:27:56.055 --> 00:27:59.561\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That is so, you've gotta now take it\n\n458\n00:27:59.561 --> 00:28:05.498\nout of how we use it as a development team\nto how everyone else is gonna see it.\n\n459\n00:28:05.498 --> 00:28:11.150\nAnd that brings us to,\nonce we've got that released of course,\n\n460\n00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:15.981\nis after you've released it,\nresponding to issues.\n\n461\n00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:21.720\nCuz nothing goes out\nthe door 100% flawless.\n\n462\n00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.310\nIf you're a software\ndeveloper you think that,\n\n463\n00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:25.651\nthen you're not a good software developer.\n\n464\n00:28:25.651 --> 00:28:27.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All kidding aside,\n\n465\n00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.140\nyou know as well as I do.\n\n466\n00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:34.043\nAside from a software developer joking\naround about it, I don't think a single\n\n467\n00:28:34.043 --> 00:28:38.286\none of them is ever going to claim,\nthis stuff is 100% bug free and\n\n468\n00:28:38.286 --> 00:28:42.692\nhonestly believe that they're playing\na joke on you when they do that.\n\n469\n00:28:42.692 --> 00:28:44.074\nThey know there's going to be problems.\n\n470\n00:28:44.074 --> 00:28:48.676\nSo when you get to a large-scale project,\nthey know they're there,\n\n471\n00:28:48.676 --> 00:28:51.179\nthey just haven't found all of them.\n\n472\n00:28:51.179 --> 00:28:54.017\nOr the ones they have found,\nthey prioritize them and say okay,\n\n473\n00:28:54.017 --> 00:28:57.750\nthese are level ones, twos, threes, or\nhowever they choose to prioritize them and\n\n474\n00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.886\nsay, we'll work through all the ones,\nbecause those are critical.\n\n475\n00:29:00.886 --> 00:29:03.230\nThose are no-goes, the product crashes,\n\n476\n00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:08.020\nwhatever, and they'll work their way\nthrough down the list if possible.\n\n477\n00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.550\nAnd usually during the development cycle,\n\n478\n00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.640\nthey have milestones saying how many\nthey gotta squash before they go on.\n\n479\n00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.240\nBut there's still a point where you've\ngotta draw a line in the sand and\n\n480\n00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.160\nsay it's going, it will ship on that date.\n\n481\n00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.640\nWhen people pick on companies and say,\nwhy did Microsoft ship this stuff,\n\n482\n00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.980\nthis thing still has bugs in it.\n\n483\n00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.710\nWell, did you ever wanna see a release\nof that software, or any software for\n\n484\n00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:31.470\nthat matter?\n\n485\n00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.300\nThere is no such thing\nas bug free software.\n\n486\n00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.610\nWhat they will do is they\nwill prioritize and they at\n\n487\n00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:40.730\nsome point have to draw the line in\nthe sand and say, okay, it's gonna ship.\n\n488\n00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:41.740\nIf you wait for\n\n489\n00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:47.370\ntomorrow to ship something, the funny\nthing about that is tomorrow never comes.\n\n490\n00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.240\nSo you'll be sitting there forever.\n\n491\n00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:55.070\nWhen I think about that\nthere was a big joke for\n\n492\n00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:59.890\nyears in the gaming industry about, and\nyou hear the term still used, vaporware.\n\n493\n00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.620\nIn the gaming industry, there's an\ninfamous project, and even if you're not\n\n494\n00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:06.610\na gamer, you can still read about this and\nget an appreciation for what happened.\n\n495\n00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.830\nThere was a game that was in\ndevelopment for over a decade,\n\n496\n00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:14.352\nI think it was actually closer to 15 years\nor something called Duke Nukem Forever.\n\n497\n00:30:14.352 --> 00:30:16.178\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n498\n00:30:16.178 --> 00:30:20.750\n>> They rewrote that and rewrote that and\nrewrote that so many times.\n\n499\n00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:25.065\nAnd the guy that was the head of the\nproject was kind of fanatical about, or\n\n500\n00:30:25.065 --> 00:30:30.086\nobsessive compulsive or whatever about,\nno, no, that doesn't look good enough.\n\n501\n00:30:30.086 --> 00:30:32.774\nDo this, this is gonna be,\nwe need to make the coolest game ever and\n\n502\n00:30:32.774 --> 00:30:33.837\ndo this and this and this.\n\n503\n00:30:33.837 --> 00:30:38.445\nAnd they actually, several times, ditched\nthe whole stuff which was almost done and\n\n504\n00:30:38.445 --> 00:30:41.653\nrewrote it again cuz he said oh,\nthat wasn't good enough.\n\n505\n00:30:41.653 --> 00:30:43.430\nAnd no, this isn't good enough,\nthat isn't good enough.\n\n506\n00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:46.577\nFinally, I couldn't believe\nthey waited this long.\n\n507\n00:30:46.577 --> 00:30:49.475\nThe company that was\nactually publishing it for,\n\n508\n00:30:49.475 --> 00:30:53.891\nthat development house said, to hell\nwith you, you finish it by this date or\n\n509\n00:30:53.891 --> 00:30:57.260\nwe will take the whole thing\naway from you, period.\n\n510\n00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:02.315\nAnd they were still kind of dawdling and\nsaying oh, no we need a little more time.\n\n511\n00:31:02.315 --> 00:31:04.619\nThey said nope, took them to court,\ntook the whole IP and\n\n512\n00:31:04.619 --> 00:31:06.710\ngave it to two other\ncompanies to finish off.\n\n513\n00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:07.321\nAnd they put the game out.\n\n514\n00:31:07.321 --> 00:31:12.557\nAnd the game was, I won't say panned but,\nfor 15 years of hype and people waiting,\n\n515\n00:31:12.557 --> 00:31:18.340\nall these promises that it's gonna be out,\nit's gonna be out, it's gonna be out.\n\n516\n00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.339\nIt was never gonna meet up expectations\nno matter how good it was.\n\n517\n00:31:20.339 --> 00:31:22.148\nAnd so it wasn't panned but\n\n518\n00:31:22.148 --> 00:31:26.900\nit wasn't the stellar type of\nreception they expected to get.\n\n519\n00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.100\n>> Maybe that's what\nthey meant by forever.\n\n520\n00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.566\nYou're gonna be waiting forever for\nthis game.\n\n521\n00:31:30.566 --> 00:31:35.733\n>> Yeah, in fact the joke they said was\nwhen you saw some of the early concept\n\n522\n00:31:35.733 --> 00:31:40.730\nart for the game and pictures of what\nthe box was supposed to look like,\n\n523\n00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:45.755\ninstead of saying, Duke Nukem Forever,\nit said, Duke Nukem Never.\n\n524\n00:31:45.755 --> 00:31:49.047\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They started joking around,\n\n525\n00:31:49.047 --> 00:31:55.820\nit's like infamous as being one of\nthe longest cases of vaporware, ever.\n\n526\n00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.415\nI think it still holds that record.\n\n527\n00:31:57.415 --> 00:32:00.484\n>> Yeah, I can definitely see,\nI've done projects around the house, and\n\n528\n00:32:00.484 --> 00:32:03.453\nprojects on my computer where you're\nlooking for that perfection and\n\n529\n00:32:03.453 --> 00:32:06.842\nyou're never gonna get there, and so\nyou're never going to actually finish.\n\n530\n00:32:06.842 --> 00:32:10.476\nAnd sometimes, you just need to say,\nokay, this is acceptable.\n\n531\n00:32:10.476 --> 00:32:13.420\nIt seems like what you're saying, with the\ndifferent levels there one, two and three,\n\n532\n00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:14.179\nit's like all right.\n\n533\n00:32:14.179 --> 00:32:17.320\nIf we can kill these bugs,\nwe can go ahead and put it out.\n\n534\n00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.470\nAnd we have patches,\nwe have updates that can go out so.\n\n535\n00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:22.850\n>> Yeah.\nYou do your best\n\n536\n00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:24.700\nto do a little triage on it.\n\n537\n00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:30.870\nGet out the stuff that is important and\ncritical to the health and\n\n538\n00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:34.090\nwell being of that product, but there's\nstill gonna be some things in there.\n\n539\n00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.160\nAnd then you just address them as they go,\nbut\n\n540\n00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.340\nthere's no such thing\nas a non-buggy product.\n\n541\n00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.600\nSo, but that's SDLC,\nthat's kind of what SDLC does.\n\n542\n00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.279\nYou can see it's a very\nstructured product.\n\n543\n00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:49.960\nI guess we've got a critic here\nsays Duke Nukem was terrible?\n\n544\n00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.320\nI don't know, I never played it.\n\n545\n00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.980\n>> It didn't come close to the hype.\n\n546\n00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.940\n>> I'll take your word for it.\n\n547\n00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.950\n>> All right, well, tell you what, Sean,\n\n548\n00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.910\nlot of good information there\nabout how we go about developing\n\n549\n00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:07.120\napplications in a secure manner by using\nthis application security framework.\n\n550\n00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.640\nAnd a lot of it just seemed to make sense.\n\n551\n00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.195\nHow can I ask my developers to make sure\nthis application is not susceptible to\n\n552\n00:33:14.195 --> 00:33:17.810\ncross-site scripting if they don't\nknow what cross-site scripting is?\n\n553\n00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:20.040\nSo training and\nall those different phases.\n\n554\n00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.210\nAnd it's great that we have a place like\nMicrosoft that spells it out for us,\n\n555\n00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.090\nthat can walk us through\nthat entire process.\n\n556\n00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.450\nSo fantastic.\n\n557\n00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:32.080\nAnything else we wanna throw in\nhere before we wrap this one up?\n\n558\n00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.820\n>> There is one thing that I\nwould bring out on this is.\n\n559\n00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.710\n>> You know about you know\nmaking sure you're saying\n\n560\n00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:43.480\nabout that was example cross-site\nscripting, they got to know that.\n\n561\n00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.990\nAnd there's plenty of other\nstuff they've got to know too.\n\n562\n00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.950\nOne of the things I've seen you know and\nI've been working and training and\n\n563\n00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:54.360\nconsulting in security for\nyou know over two decades now.\n\n564\n00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:01.820\nThat first ten years, or\nwhatever I am in the industry,\n\n565\n00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:05.380\nfifteen years in the industry,\nI didn't see many or\n\n566\n00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:11.340\ndidn't run into many developers\ncoming into the classes.\n\n567\n00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:16.192\nOr even my college classes that were doing\nstuff like you know I've filmed here for\n\n568\n00:34:16.192 --> 00:34:22.430\nITPro, like CEH, you very rarely saw\na developer come into those things.\n\n569\n00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:26.933\nBut over the last ten years and even less,\n\n570\n00:34:26.933 --> 00:34:32.415\nten years or less than that, you start\nseeing more developers showing up.\n\n571\n00:34:32.415 --> 00:34:36.605\nAnd so developers that wouldn't be caught\ndead, I guess is the way to be put,\n\n572\n00:34:36.605 --> 00:34:40.555\nin those courses before for\nthe most part were now showing up.\n\n573\n00:34:40.555 --> 00:34:43.955\nAnd they were learning\nthe skills of pen testers and\n\n574\n00:34:43.955 --> 00:34:46.665\nnow they had another thing they\ncould use in their arsenal to\n\n575\n00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:51.700\nevaluate their software way above and\nbeyond they had before.\n\n576\n00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:56.770\nAnd some of the ones I've encountered\nare credited with really ramping up\n\n577\n00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.960\nthe level of security and\nsafety in their software.\n\n578\n00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.260\nI had a couple one time in one\nof my classes that worked for,\n\n579\n00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.710\nit was a health care organization.\n\n580\n00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:10.180\nAnd these guys were,\nthey're really good at their coding,\n\n581\n00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.970\nthere was no doubt about that,\nyou know they worked with SQL,\n\n582\n00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.690\nthey worked with a few different\nprogramming languages.\n\n583\n00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:21.290\nBut then they built on top of that,\nthey acquired pen testing skills, and\n\n584\n00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:23.860\nthey were using stuff like medesploit and\nthings like that\n\n585\n00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.890\nto really just bang on and beat on and\nmess with their applications.\n\n586\n00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.950\nThey were running custom exploits and\nexploits that are really\n\n587\n00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.690\nunlocking the power of something\nlike that plus the other tools.\n\n588\n00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:38.360\nYou can see how the mating of\nthose two worlds really just\n\n589\n00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.440\nmade a tremendous difference for them.\n\n590\n00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.940\nThey needed to have that because\nthe information they were handling,\n\n591\n00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.430\nthey needed to make sure that\nit was safe and secure and\n\n592\n00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:51.630\nnot doing something stupid like having a\nnetwork to handle up on it, you know, so,\n\n593\n00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:55.660\nbecause you would never want to do that.\n\n594\n00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.300\nNo one does that.\n\n595\n00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.480\nSo, but these two worlds come together.\n\n596\n00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:06.220\nIt could only be a difference\nthat's a really, really good thing,\n\n597\n00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.620\nmaking them understand this stuff,\n\n598\n00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.970\nand then knowing what it looks like,\nand then they can go to the other side.\n\n599\n00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:14.890\nOnce they see our side they're like,\nokay, I know where it is,\n\n600\n00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:16.270\nlet me go find that in the

Rodrick,\n\n3\n00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.300\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.940\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.450\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.150\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.270\nExcited as we get another episode in our\nComp-T Advanced Security Practitioner\n\n8\n00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.240\nseries coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.470\nAnd in particular in this one we're going\nto be talking about improper storage of\n\n10\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.240\nsensitive data.\n\n11\n00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.190\nDoes not sound good.\n\n12\n00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.980\n>> Nope, it's something that could turn\nout a number of different ways, but\n\n13\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.720\nreally you're looking for the good\noutcomes, not the bad outcomes, so\n\n14\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.970\nthat's where we're kinda headed is making\nsure that you know what the risks are and\n\n15\n00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.270\ntalking about,\nhow you can protect yourself.\n\n16\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.530\nOr at least look to see if there's\na problem you need to address.\n\n17\n00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.110\n>> Absolutely.\n\n18\n00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.720\nWe gotta classify our date,\n\n19\n00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.240\nwe gotta know what data's considered\nsensitive in the first place.\n\n20\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.290\nAnd then we gotta have good\nstorage techniques for it.\n\n21\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.450\nWhich means make sure that only\nauthorized people have access to it.\n\n22\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.977\nUnauthorized people\ncan't get access to it.\n\n23\n00:01:03.977 --> 00:01:09.090\n>> Yeah, the stuff you just brought up.\n\n24\n00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.490\nThat's the stuff you're doing\nas part of your assessment, and\n\n25\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.365\nyou absolutely have got\nto get that straight.\n\n26\n00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:18.075\nOnce you get that straight,\nnow it's okay well how do you do that?\n\n27\n00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:21.445\nSo we'll assume that yeah\nwe've already done all that.\n\n28\n00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:24.505\nAnd we've checked all the boxes and\nall that.\n\n29\n00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:27.085\nIt's like okay good we've\ngot these areas addressed.\n\n30\n00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:31.330\nOkay now we gotta move, we look back\nat our SDLC as a matter of fact.\n\n31\n00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.730\nWe have a classified and\ndone all those things and we're good.\n\n32\n00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.350\nHow does that actually translate to\nreal world features and stuff like that.\n\n33\n00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.470\nAnd then what are the risks\nthat go with it?\n\n34\n00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.966\nWith those features, so that's where we're\nmoving here, is that we gotta look at what\n\n35\n00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:50.609\nthe risks are and so we'll see that and\nthen we'll show you, you know,\n\n36\n00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.192\nwe'll talk what the risks are and\nwe'll talk to you about, you know,\n\n37\n00:01:54.192 --> 00:01:57.835\nkinda show you one of the ways you can\nfind some of those issues and then,\n\n38\n00:01:57.835 --> 00:02:01.982\nyou know, kind of mix in there some of\nthe things you can do to protect yourself.\n\n39\n00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:03.566\n>> Very good.\n\n40\n00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:07.300\nAll right, you know, I guess first of all,\ndo we have to classify what it is,\n\n41\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.057\nor you're saying we already classified it.\n\n42\n00:02:10.057 --> 00:02:13.517\nSo how do we go about-\n>> Well, classified data in itself,\n\n43\n00:02:13.517 --> 00:02:16.667\nlike you were saying, you know, you\nhave to make sure that what's sensitive,\n\n44\n00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:20.200\nwhat's not,\nwhat the different shades of it are.\n\n45\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.880\nSo that would be the part\nspecifically that we've done.\n\n46\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.483\nWhich that's the area I think\nyou were talking about.\n\n47\n00:02:26.483 --> 00:02:29.340\nI think after you've done that,\n\n48\n00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.510\nthe next step to being able to\nreally classify this problem or\n\n49\n00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.020\nquantify it is what types of things\nmight you be looking for specifically.\n\n50\n00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.030\nData is kind of a generic term.\n\n51\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.180\nInformation also a generic term.\n\n52\n00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.325\nSo, what could that translate to?\n\n53\n00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:50.325\nThe stuff we've been talking about so\n\n54\n00:02:50.325 --> 00:02:55.635\nfar has been stuff that's in a development\nenvironment for web applications.\n\n55\n00:02:55.635 --> 00:02:58.155\nSo we're just sticking with that theme.\n\n56\n00:02:58.155 --> 00:03:02.235\nIf we are looking at a web application,\nwhat in a web application\n\n57\n00:03:02.235 --> 00:03:05.461\ncould be something that's an area of\nconcern that you need to protect.\n\n58\n00:03:05.461 --> 00:03:09.990\nJust to kind of put a point on it,\nyou've done that, you've done the part\n\n59\n00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.521\nclassifying data and where all this,\nand what needs to be protected, and\n\n60\n00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:19.271\nwhat level of protection needs to have,\nwe've got that, now we take that big\n\n61\n00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:24.020\nsuperset and we cut just part of it off\nand say okay, we're just gonna focus on\n\n62\n00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.993\nthe application stuff as relates to web\napplications specifically, because,\n\n63\n00:03:28.993 --> 00:03:33.599\nor we talked about the Enterprise storage\nand stuff like that so pretty much\n\n64\n00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.334\nwe've all ready addressed that part\nnow we're going to another side of it.\n\n65\n00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:39.330\n>> Okay, very good.\n\n66\n00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.530\nSo when it comes to websites or\napplications and\n\n67\n00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.260\ndata one of the first things I think\nof it are those pesky little cookies.\n\n68\n00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.218\n>> Yeah, cookies, they're great in\nthe real world except for the waist line.\n\n69\n00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:56.730\nBut so for web applications,\n\n70\n00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.550\nspecifically web browsers and\nthose related technologies, cookies, and\n\n71\n00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.290\ngotta be clear, cookies in themselves,\nwe're not saying that it's a bad thing.\n\n72\n00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.960\nCookies make the web work, as anybody\nthat's ever turned on that feature,\n\n73\n00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.770\nblock all cookies, in their browser knows.\n\n74\n00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.077\nIf you've never done that [CROSSTALK]\nyeah, the web becomes really annoying.\n\n75\n00:04:18.077 --> 00:04:21.823\nYou're like, you start all of a sudden\ngoing these kids better get off lawn, and\n\n76\n00:04:21.823 --> 00:04:22.330\nall that.\n\n77\n00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.825\n[INAUDIBLE] The number\nof complaints you get,\n\n78\n00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:27.842\nyou feel like having because\nyou're going to sit there\n\n79\n00:04:27.842 --> 00:04:32.270\nif you block all your cookies or\nyou have to approve all your cookies.\n\n80\n00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.930\nThat's the one you really look for,\nI wanna approve every one of them.\n\n81\n00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.060\nYou can't even load a basic webpage\nwithout click, click, click, click.\n\n82\n00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.860\nYou'll get like a lot of strained thumb,\nyou'll have to switch hands or\n\n83\n00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.490\nsomething before you're done with that.\n\n84\n00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.030\nSo, cookies just are something that we\nknow are there, we know we're gonna.\n\n85\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.380\nBe dealing with, but\nwe also know they're not a bad thing.\n\n86\n00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.020\nWhere they become a problem is if someone\ndecides to write an application and not\n\n87\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.590\ntake the proper steps to actually protect\nthose things, when and where needed.\n\n88\n00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.770\nThat's traditionally has been a problem.\n\n89\n00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.860\nAnd that's where some of our things\nwe mentioned earlier, and just to\n\n90\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.710\nmake sure we're on the same page here for\na moment, is to make sure that y'all know\n\n91\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.390\nwhat a cookie is, did I just say \"y'all?\"\n>> You've been in Florida too long Sean.\n\n92\n00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.640\n>> I gotta go home, I really do.\n\n93\n00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.860\n>> Feeling pretty comfortable around here.\n\n94\n00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.066\n>> I blame it on you guys all right?\n\n95\n00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:38.380\nAll of you back there.\n\n96\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.530\nTo make sure everyone is on the same\npage with what a cookie is,\n\n97\n00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.350\nit's just a text file.\n\n98\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.970\nThat's really all it is.\n\n99\n00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.640\nAnd it stores information inside of it.\n\n100\n00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.180\nThat's it.\n\n101\n00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.250\nThere's really nothing more,\nnothing less to it.\n\n102\n00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.565\nYou could give me the whole technical\nyou know high end description\n\n103\n00:05:58.565 --> 00:06:03.555\nof what a cookie is and all the stuff\nit can be stored in, don't care.\n\n104\n00:06:03.555 --> 00:06:05.335\nIt's not saying it's not important.\n\n105\n00:06:05.335 --> 00:06:09.355\nI don't care because it's still something\nthat gets written onto your drive and\n\n106\n00:06:09.355 --> 00:06:11.240\nstored in your cache.\n\n107\n00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.510\nAs part of normal operation,\nthat's a text file that stores\n\n108\n00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.450\ninformation about your visit,\nyour session inside that file.\n\n109\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.070\nSo what's in there may\nneed to be protected.\n\n110\n00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.150\nThere's cases on both sides,you\ndon't need to go hard.\n\n111\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.360\nEvery cookie would sit there\nholding it with a knife or\n\n112\n00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.260\nsomething like that, protecting it.\n\n113\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.230\nIt may be just fine the way it is.\n\n114\n00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.840\nOther ones do contain that sensitive\ninformation and those are the ones were\n\n115\n00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.940\nreally concerned about is are they being\nstored in such a way that they are safe or\n\n116\n00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.489\nare one of our other attacks for\nexample, Cross Site Scripting.\n\n117\n00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:55.660\nCross Site Scripting has\nthe very real possibility\n\n118\n00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.530\nif you're cookies aren't secured\nof reading that information and\n\n119\n00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.800\nmaturing it to someone else and\nonce they get that.\n\n120\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.450\nThere could be that session information,\nthere could be that password information,\n\n121\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.250\nthere could be a whole bunch of things and\n\n122\n00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.140\nthat precisely what you\ndon't want them to have.\n\n123\n00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.833\nAnd so, that's a bad thing.\n\n124\n00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:13.590\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n125\n00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.140\nLike you said it's really\nup to the website or\n\n126\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.280\nthe application what information\nis stored in that cookie.\n\n127\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.560\nSome of them keep it safe, and\n\n128\n00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.070\nthey don't store personally identifiable\ninformation or account information.\n\n129\n00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.300\nOthers store quite a bit.\n\n130\n00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.470\nAnd it's convenient.\n\n131\n00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.060\nWhen I go back to that site,\nit knows who I am, or\n\n132\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.610\nit remembers what I put in my shopping\ncart the last time I was at that site.\n\n133\n00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.600\nOr it says, hey, Mike.\n\n134\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.190\nWelcome back.\n\n135\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.310\nHere's some new books in\nyour favorite section.\n\n136\n00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:37.840\nThose are.\n\n137\n00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.201\nThose are handy things, but if they're\nstoring my credit card information so\n\n138\n00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:46.496\nI can do one click shopping, or if\nthey're storing my account information so\n\n139\n00:07:46.496 --> 00:07:50.393\nwhen I go to that webpage I don't have\nto type in my password and log in,\n\n140\n00:07:50.393 --> 00:07:54.318\nthen I'm worried about who might be\nable to access that information.\n\n141\n00:07:54.318 --> 00:07:59.764\n>> Yeah, that's indeed,\nwhat could be stored in that cookie and\n\n142\n00:07:59.764 --> 00:08:02.024\nit's really kind of, and\n\n143\n00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:07.573\nI know some developer might\nactually argue the point The point,\n\n144\n00:08:07.573 --> 00:08:12.940\nbut I just like to say,\nheck the sky's the limit on there.\n\n145\n00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.730\nAnd it kind of is because\nyou can store just so\n\n146\n00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.141\nmany different things inside\nthe body of a cookie.\n\n147\n00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:22.576\nIt's just a question of is, like I said,\n\n148\n00:08:22.576 --> 00:08:24.101\nis it something that\nneeds to be protected?\n\n149\n00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:30.340\nOne that was notable a few years back\nwas Google with their Gmail service and\n\n150\n00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.300\nall those little things\nthey had even before Gmail.\n\n151\n00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.380\nYou had to log into your\nGoogle account to use it.\n\n152\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.520\nWell the Google account will actually\nwrite a cookie to your drive storing\n\n153\n00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.890\ninformation in it.\n\n154\n00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:48.720\nAnd that information included things such\nas your password and other session stuff.\n\n155\n00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.400\nThe problem was is that if you\nwant to store password in that,\n\n156\n00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.350\nthere's ways to store password\nin there we're well aware of it.\n\n157\n00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.270\nThere's certain flags that you can set and\nother stuff that when it gets written to\n\n158\n00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:03.800\nthe drive it protects it and makes sure\nthat it can't be read certain ways and\n\n159\n00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.010\nit's got all the nice encryption and\neverything placed on it.\n\n160\n00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:10.780\nHowever, at the time,\nGoogle wasn't doing that.\n\n161\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.822\nAnd researchers found that, and they found\nthat yeah, there are passwords in there.\n\n162\n00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:16.967\nThere's other stuff in there.\n\n163\n00:09:16.967 --> 00:09:19.607\nAnd oh by the way, cookies can have\n\n164\n00:09:19.607 --> 00:09:24.540\nsomething there that tells them\nwhen they're going to expire.\n\n165\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.180\nGoogle set there's for\nI think it was 2038.\n\n166\n00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:32.650\nAnd they set it for that because\nthey were coding on one Unix/Linux\n\n167\n00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:37.230\noperating system and that was\nthe highest date you could put in.\n\n168\n00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.870\nIt begs the question, did they put 20 and\n38 just because of that or\n\n169\n00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.410\nwas it some other reason?\n\n170\n00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.198\nReason, because if it was just because\nthat was the highest date number that they\n\n171\n00:09:45.198 --> 00:09:48.027\ncould put in, you're telling me that if\nthe highest date they could store was like\n\n172\n00:09:48.027 --> 00:09:50.303\nthe year 10,000,\nthat was the date they would have put in?\n\n173\n00:09:50.303 --> 00:09:52.045\nSo it expires in the year 10,000?\n\n174\n00:09:52.045 --> 00:09:58.490\nIt makes zero sense and\nit's a poor decision anyway.\n\n175\n00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.570\nI don't care what the highest date you\ncan put in, if there's a reason for\n\n176\n00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.870\nyou to do that then no,\nget it out of here.\n\n177\n00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.110\n>> All right.\n>> So, that's just one part of it, though.\n\n178\n00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.290\nThat's the cookie storage issue\nis how you're storing it.\n\n179\n00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.250\nWe're know they're there,\nwe know they're not going away.\n\n180\n00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.710\nWe don't want them to go away because\nit makes a lot of convenience,\n\n181\n00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.540\na lot of sense to have that.\n\n182\n00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.240\nBut then other things we have,\nthere are other types of information.\n\n183\n00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.920\nIt's not just the cookie aspect of it.\n\n184\n00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.160\nWe talked about, in the past,\nabout securing some other data\n\n185\n00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.110\nin the form of SSL, and TLS,\nIPsec, there's ways to do that,\n\n186\n00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.620\nand we've already been down that road and\nbeaten that to death.\n\n187\n00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:45.675\nWe won't do that again,\nin depth like that.\n\n188\n00:10:45.675 --> 00:10:50.025\nSo we cut the transmission part,\nbut, so we've got the cookies and\n\n189\n00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:51.315\nstuff being stored locally.\n\n190\n00:10:51.315 --> 00:10:53.255\nBut what else can be stored locally too?\n\n191\n00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:54.665\nThat's something that's a big concern.\n\n192\n00:10:54.665 --> 00:11:00.075\nStuff that can be stored\nlocally on both your system and\n\n193\n00:11:00.075 --> 00:11:05.090\non the server, you could be\ntalking databases most definitely.\n\n194\n00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.010\nYou're talking maybe files\nthat you've saved, and maybe\n\n195\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.780\nsometimes they have little client software\nthey download to talk back and forth.\n\n196\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.401\nIt could be those type of things too.\n\n197\n00:11:16.401 --> 00:11:20.617\nSo those are also, as soon as they get\nstored on your system and are allowed\n\n198\n00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:25.241\naccess there, there's a question of\nhow they're storing their information,\n\n199\n00:11:25.241 --> 00:11:29.940\nhow it could be accessed by somebody else,\nif possible, and then, heck does it?\n\n200\n00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.440\nI'd even go as far as to say,\n\n201\n00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.880\ncan it go through and\naccess anything else in the system?\n\n202\n00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.010\nThat's a definite possibility.\n\n203\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.630\nI mean, in fact,\nsome of these web technologies,\n\n204\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.655\nFlash has been beaten on a lot recently.\n\n205\n00:11:43.655 --> 00:11:44.568\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anybody,\n\n206\n00:11:44.568 --> 00:11:50.047\nany of you in this in the field has\nalready heard the gripes about Flash,\n\n207\n00:11:50.047 --> 00:11:57.010\nand they've seen that there's been a lot\nof steam building behind that recently.\n\n208\n00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.930\nLet's banish Flash from the web and\ngo strictly stuff like HTML5,\n\n209\n00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:07.050\nwhich by the way they've also found that\nyou can do a lot of nasty stuff in it too.\n\n210\n00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.710\nLike what did they expect, right?\n\n211\n00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.580\n>> They thought HTML5 was going\nto solve all their problems.\n\n212\n00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.642\n>> That's six,\nthat's what we're waiting for.\n\n213\n00:12:12.642 --> 00:12:13.222\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n214\n00:12:13.222 --> 00:12:15.764\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So yeah,\n\n215\n00:12:15.764 --> 00:12:17.460\nyou can't do it all at once.\n\n216\n00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.718\nI mean, come on.\n\n217\n00:12:18.718 --> 00:12:22.950\nSo there's that.\n\n218\n00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:27.610\nBut as far as talking\nabout that storage and\n\n219\n00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.580\ntransmission and then even what data\nyou're storing, you've also gotta think of\n\n220\n00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:36.890\nsomething that was mentioned prior\nin some of our other segments.\n\n221\n00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.490\nThings like weak encryption.\n\n222\n00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:44.232\nWe're going to talk about that just\nbriefly here, is you have to think as\n\n223\n00:12:44.232 --> 00:12:49.129\na developer, or as that SQL person,\nare you giving an appropriate level of\n\n224\n00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:54.029\nencryption to the data that's being\nstored in your server or anything else\n\n225\n00:12:54.029 --> 00:12:58.729\noutside of a cookie, of course,\nthat you're storing on your client?\n\n226\n00:12:58.729 --> 00:13:01.812\nBecause you do not want someone\nelse accessing that either.\n\n227\n00:13:01.812 --> 00:13:05.210\nAnd so that's another big question\nthat you have to address.\n\n228\n00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.450\nAnd that's something the SDLC\ncomes into play with and\n\n229\n00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.350\nsays, hey by the way did\nyou look at this issue?\n\n230\n00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.060\nThat's what it's supposed to do.\n\n231\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.720\n>> So how do we, is there a way that\nwe can check this out to see if\n\n232\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.960\nthe cookies are being stored properly or\n\n233\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.760\nif we're developing,\nI mean where do we go from here?\n\n234\n00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.020\n>> Yeah,\nyou've actually got numerous options here.\n\n235\n00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.800\nJust, it depends on\nwhich way you wanna go.\n\n236\n00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.360\nYou've seen some of them in both our\nethical hacking and our forensics\n\n237\n00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:39.150\nexploration, and you've seen some of\nthem in our [INAUDIBLE] exploration.\n\n238\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.740\n>> There's even more out beyond that.\n\n239\n00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.140\nI mean obviously if you want to\nsee if stuff is being transmitted,\n\n240\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:50.040\nI can do something as simple as like\nyou were doing with your IPsec demo.\n\n241\n00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.103\nPing would actually confirm whether or\nnot it's working or not.\n\n242\n00:13:52.103 --> 00:13:55.288\nIt would be enough to see if you got\nthe initial stuff working or not, I guess,\n\n243\n00:13:55.288 --> 00:13:56.660\nis a better way to put it.\n\n244\n00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.048\nBut you could also use Wireshark to look\nat filters to see if your getting, and\n\n245\n00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:02.950\nuse filters and see if stuff is\ncoming across the right way.\n\n246\n00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:07.390\nSo you've got that, but\nlet's turn it to another area.\n\n247\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.130\nLet's talk about the stuff\nthat's being transmitted,\n\n248\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:15.282\nthe communication that's going back and\nforth between you and the website.\n\n249\n00:14:15.282 --> 00:14:19.300\nAll right, so what I have on\nscreen here is I have Burp Suite.\n\n250\n00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.540\nBurp Suite is a utility used,\nand one that we've seen before,\n\n251\n00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:30.100\nthat's used view the interaction\nbetween a web browser and\n\n252\n00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.440\nthe web server/web application.\n\n253\n00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.450\nAnd so what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to use this just one more time here\n\n254\n00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:42.470\nto see just what it's seeing and\nwhat that really kind of would mean to\n\n255\n00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:47.120\nyou in the terms of maybe\ntweaking your application, and\n\n256\n00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.290\ndoing adjustments to it to get it\nto be more secure, if you need to.\n\n257\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:55.023\nI want to caution, with tools like this,\njust jumping in and\n\n258\n00:14:55.023 --> 00:14:58.463\nusing the tool without any\nbackground knowledge of it or\n\n259\n00:14:58.463 --> 00:15:03.296\nbackground knowledge of the environment\nyou're stepping into might lead you\n\n260\n00:15:03.296 --> 00:15:06.820\nto panic or freak out in places where-\n>> Might scare you a little bit, huh?\n\n261\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's like,\n\n262\n00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.910\nwell look at all the stuff\nthat's being puked up.\n\n263\n00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.320\nIt's like, oh no, hold on.\n\n264\n00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.970\nThat's not something that's a bad problem.\n\n265\n00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.190\nIt's something that's natural.\n\n266\n00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.440\nWe're good with it.\n\n267\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.910\nAnd we don't need to worry about that.\n\n268\n00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.150\nBut, we can move on and\n\n269\n00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:26.870\nsee if there's anything else that is\na concern that shouldn't be there.\n\n270\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:32.530\nAnd also remember, this is just one view\nof the information that's being passed.\n\n271\n00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.270\nThere's other types of information being\npassed that we can get through other\n\n272\n00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.430\nutilities.\n\n273\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.630\nBut this is just to show you\nsome of the options, and\n\n274\n00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:44.030\nto kind of give you illustrations\nof some stuff we just talked about.\n\n275\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.460\nSo what I have here is,\nso this is Burp Suite.\n\n276\n00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.414\nAnd just to reiterate,\n\n277\n00:15:49.414 --> 00:15:54.594\nBurp Suite is a Java based\napplication that you can download for\n\n278\n00:15:54.594 --> 00:15:59.791\nfree, and do very little configuration and\nit's ready to go.\n\n279\n00:15:59.791 --> 00:16:04.632\nAll you gotta do is just\nstart doing your deal.\n\n280\n00:16:04.632 --> 00:16:08.139\nSo what I'm doing here\nis I chose a website And\n\n281\n00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:12.213\nthe website shows that it's\njust a gaming website.\n\n282\n00:16:12.213 --> 00:16:17.016\nTo put the reason out there why\nI chose a gaming website is I\n\n283\n00:16:17.016 --> 00:16:21.919\nknow there's a lot of stuff\nhappening with this website,\n\n284\n00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:25.723\nlike social media connections and\nvideos and\n\n285\n00:16:25.723 --> 00:16:30.226\nI most definitely know\nthere's cookies in there, so\n\n286\n00:16:30.226 --> 00:16:36.570\nthat's the reason why I chose this,\nbut I could do this with any site.\n\n287\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.600\nI just wanted to make it a little\nmore interesting here, so just so\n\n288\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.800\nyou're wondering why he'd he choose that?\n\n289\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.090\nIs there a security problem with it?\n\n290\n00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.900\nNo, it's just because it's\ngiving me something that\n\n291\n00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.470\nlooks more interesting to you.\n\n292\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.180\nAnd shows you some stuff more than\njust hey, look what it's looking at.\n\n293\n00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.730\nAnd oh well, that's good and\nno I want to see a little more.\n\n294\n00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.560\nAlright, so I got the URL punched in and\n\n295\n00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.810\nlets just go ahead and load this from\nscratch again so I'm going to go ahead and\n\n296\n00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.710\nhit enter and you can see well,\nnothings happening.\n\n297\n00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:09.280\nSo what's actually happening is if we go\nover to this side you'll see that and\n\n298\n00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.190\nI kind of while that's loading,\nI have got my, while\n\n299\n00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:19.830\nthat's loading back there stuff is being\nrouted through Verb Sweep as a proxy.\n\n300\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.750\nAnd so, what I'm seeing over\nhere on this side is I am seeing\n\n301\n00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.190\nthe results of just the header\ninformation we've passed back and forth.\n\n302\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:33.460\nSo, if you look up top, kind of just\na little bit above this window,\n\n303\n00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.160\nyou can actually see where\nthe requests are going to.\n\n304\n00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:44.050\nIt might be a little kind of small there,\nbut [COUGH] we can kind of zoom that up.\n\n305\n00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:50.700\nSo if we zoom in on that and\nsee that, there is.\n\n306\n00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.980\nYou can see where the request\nis being made to.\n\n307\n00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.660\nYou can see the IP address.\n\n308\n00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:02.330\nAnd then underneath that we see kind of\na clear look at what's actually happening.\n\n309\n00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:06.165\nSo and not all of that stuff is going\nto make sense to you right away and\n\n310\n00:18:06.165 --> 00:18:07.570\nit's not a big deal.\n\n311\n00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:11.580\nThis is just again to show you\nan idea of what's being passed.\n\n312\n00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:16.270\nYou know so with this it's make a request\nand you can see the user age information,\n\n313\n00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.830\nyour browser information, stuff like that.\n\n314\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:22.716\nOkay, and where it's kind of,\nwhat's happening, I hit forward,\n\n315\n00:18:22.716 --> 00:18:27.545\nit keeps more stuff is going, you see more\nbrowser stuff being passed back and forth.\n\n316\n00:18:27.545 --> 00:18:30.936\nAnd as I keep going forward and\nstep through this,\n\n317\n00:18:30.936 --> 00:18:35.458\nevery time I hit forward it's\npassing it along and saying, okay,\n\n318\n00:18:35.458 --> 00:18:41.210\nlet whoever's requesting that and that's\nsupposed to go to, let it go on to them.\n\n319\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.330\nDon't keep stopping it here.\n\n320\n00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.700\nSo I just keep going.\n\n321\n00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.870\nI mean, look at this one.\n\n322\n00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.460\nThis one has several\nthings happening in it.\n\n323\n00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.596\nIt has the host,\nit has the user agent information,\n\n324\n00:18:52.596 --> 00:18:55.980\nwhich we've already seen several times,\n\n325\n00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.060\nwhich if you look at it,\nyou see it says Mozilla Windows NT 63.\n\n326\n00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:05.010\nWindows on Windows 64 so\nyou know I've seen that.\n\n327\n00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.900\nOkay, well that's something that\ncan give me some information about\n\n328\n00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.960\nthe system back there but\nthen you can see down at the bottom,\n\n329\n00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.140\nyou can see it's got\nthe actual cookie information.\n\n330\n00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.053\nYou know, so we're seeing cookie\ninformation start to show up in here.\n\n331\n00:19:18.053 --> 00:19:23.690\nAnd as I keep going you know, you'll keep\nseeing more and more stuff happening.\n\n332\n00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.320\nLittle bit of a delay there,\nsometimes that happens.\n\n333\n00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.310\nSo it just keeps stepping through.\n\n334\n00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.310\nNow I don't need to go through every\n\n335\n00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:36.670\nstep to load this page because\nthis will take a while to do.\n\n336\n00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.260\nIf you keep hitting forward,\nnotice when we go over here,\n\n337\n00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.410\nit still hasn't really\nfilled up much over there.\n\n338\n00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.460\nSo if I just keep hitting forward and\nforward and\n\n339\n00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:51.320\nforward, it will eventually get to the end\nof this and load everything and be done.\n\n340\n00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.180\nBut we haven't got there [COUGH] yet.\n\n341\n00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.360\nSo just keep going, and so\nit's waiting for another request.\n\n342\n00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.110\nThere we go, it's a request to Akamai.\n\n343\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.220\nSo what's that telling me,\nwhen I look up there?\n\n344\n00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.304\nThis means the site that I'm making\na request to is probably loading something\n\n345\n00:20:07.304 --> 00:20:08.998\nfrom an ad network or something like that.\n\n346\n00:20:08.998 --> 00:20:15.456\nIt would be my initial guess that\nI base on nothing whatsoever.\n\n347\n00:20:15.456 --> 00:20:18.620\n[LAUGH] So, but\n[COUGH] I just keep going, like I said,\n\n348\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.270\nI just keep going through this.\n\n349\n00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.460\nBut there's a video on.\n\n350\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.680\nThere's one saying it's doing\na get request to pull video down.\n\n351\n00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.230\nAnd then you see some stuff in\nhere saying about Java Script.\n\n352\n00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:34.809\nNow like I said, don't need to go through\nevery last little detail that's in fact,\n\n353\n00:20:34.809 --> 00:20:39.268\nI can say turn the intercept off and\nit will just go ahead.\n\n354\n00:20:39.268 --> 00:20:44.310\nIf I hit refresh on this it should\njust go ahead and load the page.\n\n355\n00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.830\nNotice I'm not doing\nanything I went ahead and\n\n356\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:51.790\nloaded the page just right\naway because this guy\n\n357\n00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.400\nover here is no longer intercepting\nanything cuz I turned that off.\n\n358\n00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.610\nSo [COUGH] that's just a sub.\n\n359\n00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.280\nWhat you saw there is you saw\nthe interplay back and forth.\n\n360\n00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.200\nIf you're a developer,\n\n361\n00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.670\nyou're looking at those headers\nsaying okay, what's being revealed?\n\n362\n00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:04.670\nIs that bad?\n\n363\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.460\nIt that just a matter of due course?\n\n364\n00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.290\nAny actions I should take?\n\n365\n00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:15.581\nAnd interestingly enough in here, not only\nare you restricted to just viewing that.\n\n366\n00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:19.758\nYou actually when those things show\nup on those headers you actually have\n\n367\n00:21:19.758 --> 00:21:21.480\nthe ability to edit them too.\n\n368\n00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.903\nSo you could say why it's there, you\ncould highlight a section, edit it, and\n\n369\n00:21:25.903 --> 00:21:27.645\nthen forward that on instead so\n\n370\n00:21:27.645 --> 00:21:31.684\nyou're actually doing what amounts\nto a man in the middle type of tack.\n\n371\n00:21:31.684 --> 00:21:34.766\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\nyou're modifying it and\n\n372\n00:21:34.766 --> 00:21:39.651\nseeing what the end result would be and\nthat would be invaluable as a developer\n\n373\n00:21:39.651 --> 00:21:42.900\nto see different conditions\nof what might happen.\n\n374\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.069\nAnd you'll notice by the way just kinda\nmove away from the proxy part of it and\n\n375\n00:21:47.069 --> 00:21:51.303\nintercepting the headers when you go\nthrough here you can see there's a lot of\n\n376\n00:21:51.303 --> 00:21:52.890\nother stuff happening too.\n\n377\n00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.400\nFeatures in here that we don't\nneed to get into now, but\n\n378\n00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.890\nit's just something that you may want to\nas an application developer look into.\n\n379\n00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.970\nAnd it can help you track down those\ncross site scripting things and\n\n380\n00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:03.630\nall the other stuff.\n\n381\n00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.074\nThe nastiness we talked about,\nit's right there.\n\n382\n00:22:06.074 --> 00:22:08.210\n>> Nice.\n\n383\n00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.880\n>> There you go.\n\n384\n00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.330\nThere's what Burp Suite does for\nyou and you can choose to use this, or\n\n385\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.040\nyou can choose to do another one.\n\n386\n00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.280\nCool thing about it like I said since\nit does work on cross platforms,\n\n387\n00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.910\nall of your downloading\nis just a .jar file.\n\n388\n00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.410\nYou can take this to any system and\n\n389\n00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:27.580\nrun it that supports Java and\nit's the exact same interface.\n\n390\n00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.310\nNo differences, no things jumping\nout of the woodwork to say hey,\n\n391\n00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.670\nthat doesn't work or this is new on this\nsystem but we can't do it over there so\n\n392\n00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.510\nto heck with that, it's none of that.\n\n393\n00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.910\nThere's a lot of tools that do that.\n\n394\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.400\nThis is not one of those, so\ndefinitely benefits there.\n\n395\n00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.369\n>> But you definitely get to see what\ninformation is being passed in those\n\n396\n00:22:45.369 --> 00:22:47.378\ncookies, so\nit gives you a chance to say, ooh,\n\n397\n00:22:47.378 --> 00:22:50.394\nI don't like the fact that that cookie\nis storing this information, or\n\n398\n00:22:50.394 --> 00:22:52.800\nsending this bit of\ninformation across there.\n\n399\n00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.740\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n400\n00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.550\n>> Very good.\n\n401\n00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.470\nAll right and then you've got another one\nlisted there, the good old poodle attack.\n\n402\n00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.620\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n403\n00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:03.827\n>> The poodle attack is one that I had\nactually mentioned just in passing\n\n404\n00:23:03.827 --> 00:23:09.054\nwhen we talked about securing\ntransmissions several episodes ago.\n\n405\n00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:12.364\nWell, I kind of want to revisit that\nbecause we are talking about web\n\n406\n00:23:12.364 --> 00:23:14.940\napplications again and\nthis is what this targeted.\n\n407\n00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:21.280\nWhat I just brought up on screen here is\njust a quick and dirty posting on this.\n\n408\n00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.082\nYou can look up Poodle Attack\nas it relates to SSL.\n\n409\n00:23:24.082 --> 00:23:29.250\nPoodle attack sounds like the worst\n[LAUGH] low budget horror movie ever.\n\n410\n00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.420\nWhat are they going to do?\n\n411\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.570\nShat on me?\n\n412\n00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.560\n>> Tim's going to be worried\nbecause he does have a poodle.\n\n413\n00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.520\nHe's going to be fearful for\nhis poodle's life.\n\n414\n00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.265\n>> You never know.\n\n415\n00:23:37.265 --> 00:23:42.045\n[LAUGH] Those things can get some nasty\ncurls in their hair or something.\n\n416\n00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:44.000\n[LAUGH] I don't know what goes on.\n\n417\n00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.100\nBut anyway, what we've got is\nthe Poodle Attack was something that\n\n418\n00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.760\nwhat happened here and\nyou can see the date on it that it had.\n\n419\n00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.739\nThat it was talked about at\nleast in this case October 14,\n\n420\n00:23:55.739 --> 00:23:59.814\n2014 so almost,\ncoming up on a year kind of sort of here.\n\n421\n00:23:59.814 --> 00:24:05.160\nWell what it did was if you were using,\nif you were vulnerable to Poodle Attack\n\n422\n00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.178\nwhat it meant was Is you had a site\nthat supported older versions of SSL for\n\n423\n00:24:10.178 --> 00:24:15.197\nlegacy purposes and what would happen\nis someone would find out that your\n\n424\n00:24:15.197 --> 00:24:20.330\nwebsite supported that by doing\nqueries and doing some of the recon.\n\n425\n00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.690\nThey'd find that out or\njust try to brute force it, so to speak,\n\n426\n00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.470\nand see if it would work.\n\n427\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.750\nAnd what happened is is\nthey would say okay,\n\n428\n00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.370\nthis website supports the newer stuff,\nbut our server's the older stuff for\n\n429\n00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.120\nthose downline legacy clients\nthat can't use the new stuff.\n\n430\n00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.670\nCuz we always wanna.\n\n431\n00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.490\nHeck, we're trying to sell for\nlike e-com or something,\n\n432\n00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.740\nI wanna sell as much as possible.\n\n433\n00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.744\nSo I don't wanna cut\nanybody out of the picture.\n\n434\n00:24:44.744 --> 00:24:49.158\nWell, what happens is\nbecause you supported that,\n\n435\n00:24:49.158 --> 00:24:52.380\nyou could actually force the system.\n\n436\n00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.260\nInstead of using TLS,\n\n437\n00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.880\nwhich is as this even posting of notes,\nis the stronger version.\n\n438\n00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.670\nSSL is the older stuff.\n\n439\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:07.780\nIt's still good, but it has problems\nthat TLS doesn't suffer from.\n\n440\n00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.190\nSo what happened is someone will go to a\nwebsite that supported the newer stuff but\n\n441\n00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:15.230\nfound out they just put the older stuff or\nsuspected it.\n\n442\n00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.190\nAnd they could fire information\nat that site that would actually\n\n443\n00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:22.180\ncause it to switch from the newer\none over to the older one.\n\n444\n00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.770\nAnd the older one had flaws\nin it that would allow you to\n\n445\n00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.230\ndo some nastiness in there.\n\n446\n00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.544\nPotentially bypass security and\n\n447\n00:25:30.544 --> 00:25:34.930\ndo some stuff with the system\nthat you shouldn't be able to do.\n\n448\n00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:39.939\nAnd so what you wanna do, the fix for this\nreally, is you're not going to go in and\n\n449\n00:25:39.939 --> 00:25:43.105\ntweak SSL to get it to all\nof a sudden not have a flaw,\n\n450\n00:25:43.105 --> 00:25:45.560\nthey took care of the whole flaw thing.\n\n451\n00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.980\nIt's called TLS.\n\n452\n00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.690\nDon't use that, don't use the old stuff.\n\n453\n00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:54.360\nIf you're vulnerable to this,\nI force you to use the older version and\n\n454\n00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.110\nI come right on in,\nwith the right conditions,\n\n455\n00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.130\ncome right on in and\ndo whatever I set out to do at that point.\n\n456\n00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.260\nSo just disable it and\nyou don't have this problem.\n\n457\n00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.020\nSimple as that.\n\n458\n00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.010\nCheck a box in your web server,\nyour web application,\n\n459\n00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.190\nsaying thou shall not use this and\nclick it off.\n\n460\n00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.900\nThose people that don't support that,\ngo to their site,\n\n461\n00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.730\nyou could put a message up there,\nyou don't support the new stuff.\n\n462\n00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.090\nGo get a modern browser.\n\n463\n00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:23.220\nYou could do that and\nthen you're helping them out.\n\n464\n00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.680\nHopefully you're helping them out and\nthey're gonna follow that advice,\n\n465\n00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:33.810\nyou can lead a horse to water, right, but\nI could put the advice out there saying\n\n466\n00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:39.140\nyour browser doesn't support the new\nstuff, so recommend you do this.\n\n467\n00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.750\nCome on back, we're happy to have you.\n\n468\n00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.120\n>> They're really taking advantage of\nthe fact that somebody's trying to\n\n469\n00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.150\nbe backwards compatible.\n\n470\n00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.400\nThey want their web applications or\nto support the new stuff, but\n\n471\n00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.090\nalso support the older stuff.\n\n472\n00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.993\nSo that legacy,\npeople that are running older stuff,\n\n473\n00:26:53.993 --> 00:26:57.474\ncan still connect to the website,\nbuy a product or what have you.\n\n474\n00:26:57.474 --> 00:27:01.752\nBut somebody's figured out that they can\nmanipulate that negotiation process,\n\n475\n00:27:01.752 --> 00:27:05.224\nforce that web server to negotiate\na weaker, older protocol, and\n\n476\n00:27:05.224 --> 00:27:06.785\nthen take advantage of that.\n\n477\n00:27:06.785 --> 00:27:08.341\n>> Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n478\n00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:11.245\nI do think it's notable.\n\n479\n00:27:12.517 --> 00:27:16.225\nAnd Mike's put the actual URL for\nit out there.\n\n480\n00:27:16.225 --> 00:27:21.335\nI do think it's notable that if you\nlook at that article, they do even note\n\n481\n00:27:21.335 --> 00:27:26.480\nin that article that\nyou're actually sharing\n\n482\n00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.380\nthe blame here by leaving that on with\nthe person that's using an older browser\n\n483\n00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.950\nbecause you're not doing anything to\nforce them to use a newer browser.\n\n484\n00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.580\nIf you keep making the stuff available\nthere's no compelling reason for\n\n485\n00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.750\nthem to upgrade.\n\n486\n00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.090\n>> The average user is gonna say,\nwell, everything works.\n\n487\n00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.220\nWhy would I bother upgrading.\n\n488\n00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.720\nI hear horror stories about the new stuff.\n\n489\n00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.570\nI don't wanna learn new stuff,\nor whatever the excuse is.\n\n490\n00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:52.100\nThe business doesn't wanna redo all\ntheir images with this new software,\n\n491\n00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.020\nthe latest version.\n\n492\n00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:57.110\nSo, they're able to stay on that\nold stuff because we allow that.\n\n493\n00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.390\nWe don't force them to use new stuff.\n\n494\n00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.350\n>> Yeah that's exactly it,\nyou want to, you\n\n495\n00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:06.400\nneed to get on board yourself with making\nsure that you're not a victim of this but\n\n496\n00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.480\nyou also, you have a responsibility.\n\n497\n00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.060\nAnd I think it's a completely\nvalid point to make sure that\n\n498\n00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.970\nthey don't become a victim either,\nbecause they could be,\n\n499\n00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:19.950\nthere's things that are also inherent in\nthe situation by using an older browser.\n\n500\n00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:23.030\nThat is gonna cause them\nproblems that they should not be,\n\n501\n00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.860\nthey don't have to be exposed to.\n\n502\n00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.173\n>> I'm not a part of our development\nteam here, but I know I've heard their\n\n503\n00:28:29.173 --> 00:28:32.180\ndiscussions over there saying how\nfar back do we want to support.\n\n504\n00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.230\nWe've got to draw the line somewhere.\n\n505\n00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.500\nAnd sometimes security is one of those\nthings that helps us draw that line\n\n506\n00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.340\nand say, okay.\n\n507\n00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.830\nWe're not going back past this\nversion of a particular browser or\n\n508\n00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.500\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n509\n00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:49.890\n>> Yeah, it's actually one of the benefits\nto kind of, one of the benefits or\n\n510\n00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:57.180\nthings that Apple has done that was good\nfor them is that they've been They got,\n\n511\n00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:01.970\npeople sometimes ding them about this,\nbut the fact that they\n\n512\n00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.850\ntraditionally have said that we only\nsupport back to a certain date.\n\n513\n00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:06.390\nAfter that, you're on your own.\n\n514\n00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:07.680\nWe're not helping you anymore.\n\n515\n00:29:08.875 --> 00:29:12.265\nThey kind of had that\nattitude like that and\n\n516\n00:29:12.265 --> 00:29:16.695\npeople look at it as hey they're\nforcing the upgrade, oh imagine that.\n\n517\n00:29:16.695 --> 00:29:18.926\nIt's like why are you running\nthis old stuff anyway.\n\n518\n00:29:18.926 --> 00:29:23.432\nThe Windows world, Microsoft's tried to\nbe the do all end all of everything and\n\n519\n00:29:23.432 --> 00:29:27.066\nthat's from a business strategy\nstandpoint that's good, but\n\n520\n00:29:27.066 --> 00:29:28.765\nfrom a security standpoint.\n\n521\n00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.070\nIt's a nightmare because\nyou have this crazy mix\n\n522\n00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:38.620\nof things that are happening that we\nnow have to face as security engineers.\n\n523\n00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.510\nIt makes our life difficult.\n\n524\n00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:44.065\nWe laugh when we hear\nsomeone installed Windows95.\n\n525\n00:29:44.065 --> 00:29:47.279\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly like that.\n\n526\n00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:52.625\nSo, we laugh when we hear people on\nWindows95, but you may laugh even harder\n\n527\n00:29:52.625 --> 00:29:58.382\nat me and should be horrified when you\nhear there's still people on Windows 3.1.\n\n528\n00:29:58.382 --> 00:30:04.750\nSo that situation shouldn't exist for\nso many reasons.\n\n529\n00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:09.170\nSo you just have to kinda\nkeep that in mind that those\n\n530\n00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:12.030\nsituations do exist and\nyou're going to have to face them.\n\n531\n00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.830\nSo let's do what we can to get\nthese people off this older stuff.\n\n532\n00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:19.004\n>> All right, well Sean, real good look\nat how we can handle some of the data\n\n533\n00:30:19.004 --> 00:30:21.521\nthat these web applications\nare sending back and forth.\n\n534\n00:30:21.521 --> 00:30:25.775\nWhere we can see it, and view it and\ndecide whether or not it's containing any\n\n535\n00:30:25.775 --> 00:30:29.850\nsensitive information and then figuring\nout the best way to handle that.\n\n536\n00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:33.860\nWhether we just not store that in cookies\nor choose to encrypt those cookies with\n\n537\n00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.820\na better encryption or\nwhatever our solution might be.\n\n538\n00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:37.920\nSo great episode there Sean,\n\n539\n00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.830\nanything else we want to throw\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n540\n00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.710\n>> Yeah.\nI think we're golden on this one.\n\n541\n00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:45.230\nWe've got what we needed to on this.\n\n542\n00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.140\n>> All right.\nWell, ladies and\n\n543\n00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.330\ngentlemen, that's going to do it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n544\n00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.510\nSigning of for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n545\n00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:51.440\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n546\n00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.120\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

00:00:17.071\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick,\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:18.010\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.740\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.540\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.430\nWe got another exciting\nepisode coming your way in\n\n8\n00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.630\nour CompT Advanced Security Practitioner\nseries.\n\n9\n00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.660\nAnd in this one we're gonna be\nlooking at other application issues.\n\n10\n00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.800\nI know it's a strange title but if you've\nbeen, watching the previous episodes.\n\n11\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.690\nWe've been working out way through\napplication sandboxing and\n\n12\n00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.090\napplication vulnerabilities, and\nweb applications and cookies.\n\n13\n00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.750\nAnd so now we're just gonna take\na look at some of the things that\n\n14\n00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.720\ndon't fall neatly into one\nof those other categories.\n\n15\n00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.990\nSo this is like all the other\nstuff that we've gotta deal with.\n\n16\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.160\nWhen it comes to applications and\nsecurity.\n\n17\n00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.890\n>> Yeah, this is kind of the\nmiscellaneous, lost and found, I guess.\n\n18\n00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.880\nSo it's little bit of a strange one, but\n\n19\n00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.605\nwe're strange people here too,\nso that kinda fits in.\n\n20\n00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:07.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so what we're getting into here,\n\n21\n00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.920\nlike I said,\nit's like miscellaneous kind of stuff.\n\n22\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.890\nJust to kind of put it\nout there on the things\n\n23\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.600\nthat are definitely web application\narena issues that pop up, or\n\n24\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.490\nthings that have issues pop up\naround them in a very general sense.\n\n25\n00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.560\nAgain, we're not going to go through\nall these issues that come up with this\n\n26\n00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.720\nstuff, in fact.\n\n27\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.840\nWe're just gonna talk about\nthese are areas, also,\n\n28\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.270\nthat you should evaluate as part\nof your assessment, your design,\n\n29\n00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.750\nto make sure you're where you should be,\nor in a good spot, at the very least.\n\n30\n00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.170\nSo these are just a bunch of, really,\nboth development tools as well as\n\n31\n00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.660\nthings that can be part of the overall\ndevelopment of the same period.\n\n32\n00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.500\n>> And the first one you got on\nthe list there, Java script.\n\n33\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.670\nThat one jumps out at you.\n\n34\n00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.850\n>> Yeah Java script.\n\n35\n00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.510\nOld old old technology.\n\n36\n00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.896\nIt's been around and\ndone it's job quite well for\n\n37\n00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:13.390\na long time for a long time, but\nit does have plenty of flaws.\n\n38\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.680\nIf you look at the updates for any browser\nor OS or anything like that you will\n\n39\n00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.470\nnote that, if you really look at it, that\nthere's plenty of updates for JavaScript.\n\n40\n00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.800\nThey happen all the time.\n\n41\n00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.630\nThere always seems to be something in\nthere it doesn't mean that it's a really\n\n42\n00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.360\ncrazy, nasty, buggy language.\n\n43\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.870\nIt just means it's got a lot of\ntentacles that they're going through and\n\n44\n00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.840\ndealing with.\n\n45\n00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.650\nAnd so they have to go through and\n\n46\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.310\nrelease these updates as\nthey as they come through.\n\n47\n00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.130\nJavaScript, it's a decent language.\n\n48\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.000\nIt's a scripting language.\n\n49\n00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.800\nIt's something that it has\ndone its job for a long time.\n\n50\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.780\nIt gives us a lot of neat things.\n\n51\n00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.070\nIt's probably not gonna\ngo away anytime soon\n\n52\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.790\njust because of how common it is and\nhow accessible it is.\n\n53\n00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.810\nA lot of people,\nthis is where they jumped into the whole\n\n54\n00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.000\nidea of doing web development and\nweb design.\n\n55\n00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.680\nThis is where they really start kind\nof getting to that next level above and\n\n56\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.030\nbeyond just a static web page and\nthey start going up to that.\n\n57\n00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.935\nSo it does have a lot of exposure.\n\n58\n00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:24.043\n>> It's a huge code base, so there's lot\nof pages you can go to and download,\n\n59\n00:03:24.043 --> 00:03:28.612\nyou know, menus and sidebars and things\nlike that, pre-written java scripts and\n\n60\n00:03:28.612 --> 00:03:29.725\nstuff like that.\n\n61\n00:03:29.725 --> 00:03:30.915\nIt's all over the place.\n\n62\n00:03:30.915 --> 00:03:34.495\n>> Yeah, in fact, that's an extremely\ngood point there because\n\n63\n00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:39.015\nwith that vast library of Java Script\nstuff that's sitting out there,\n\n64\n00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.360\nfirst of all that's\na huge benefit to have.\n\n65\n00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.840\nIf you're someone that needs to have\na script to put on their site and\n\n66\n00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.350\nyou're not really a JavaScript person.\n\n67\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.670\nWhat, you left out in the cold?\n\n68\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.215\nNo, just go to a website and grab one and\nwith a few tweaks you can do that.\n\n69\n00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:57.855\nI know I did.\nIt sounds like you did it too.\n\n70\n00:03:57.855 --> 00:03:58.805\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n71\n00:03:58.805 --> 00:03:59.745\nWhy reinvent the wheel.\n\n72\n00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:03.095\nIf somebody's already got the idea and\nI can use theirs because they're freely\n\n73\n00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:07.035\navailable and I can just tweak it to\nsuit my needs and learn something.\n\n74\n00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.880\nNext time, maybe I don't have to go to\nthat site because now I've learned that\n\n75\n00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.010\ncode, but I'm relying one somebody else's\ncode, and is it doing error checking,\n\n76\n00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.010\nis it doing any kind of\nsecurity checks in there?\n\n77\n00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.050\nI don't know.\n\n78\n00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.540\n>> Yeah, that's questionable and\n\n79\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.510\nif it gets complex enough,\nwhat is it really doing?\n\n80\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.830\nYou know there's a point where\nyou've go to be paranoid about this.\n\n81\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.460\nIt's like is it I don't understand it.\n\n82\n00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.680\nIs it doing something or\nis it completely on the level and fine.\n\n83\n00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.170\nYou're probably gonna be fine\nin just about most cases.\n\n84\n00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.170\nYou'll never know.\n\n85\n00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.560\nSo but\nI don't make a huge issue about that\n\n86\n00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.710\nwith Java Script even though\nI know it's a possibility.\n\n87\n00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.695\nFor the most part,\nit's proven to be pretty safe and\n\n88\n00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:53.790\nnot have too many problems on that side.\n\n89\n00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.170\nBut just something that everyone\nsupports so it's across the broad,\n\n90\n00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.010\nsomething you need to think about.\n\n91\n00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.080\n>> And then you HTML 5 down here,\n\n92\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.445\nHTML 5 that's brand new, that's got\nall the security I need built into it.\n\n93\n00:05:06.445 --> 00:05:11.050\n>> [LAUGH] Of course,\nlet's go to the next one.\n\n94\n00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.360\nHTML 5, it's already been shown to\nhave problems of various types in it.\n\n95\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.330\nThat doesn't mean that you need to\nkind of shy away from going to HTML 5.\n\n96\n00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.160\nIt just means that you need to be\naware that, obviously you know we\n\n97\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.240\nwere joking about that here and saying, oh\nyou know, it's new, there's no problems.\n\n98\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.910\nAnd you know Mike's joking about that.\n\n99\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.320\nIt's gonna have problems.\n\n100\n00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.080\nThere's a lot of complexes,\nthere's a lot of things happening.\n\n101\n00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.450\nSo we know there's going to be problems\nand whether we've found them or not,\n\n102\n00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.090\nwe know that they're there.\n\n103\n00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.990\nAnd people have found those already.\n\n104\n00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:48.020\nThey've found stuff that, heck,\nthey found some stuff that they vilified\n\n105\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.510\nFlash over, they found the some\nof the same ones in HTML 5.\n\n106\n00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.730\nSo I mean, heck, some of those\nflaws I heard about only about\n\n107\n00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.130\ntwo to three weeks ago, the HTML5,\nwhen they were beating on Flash saying,\n\n108\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:10.010\noh well, remember for a while Mozilla said\nwe're blocking Flash from being in there.\n\n109\n00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.200\nWell, some people chimed in and\nsaid, by the way,\n\n110\n00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.960\nthat HTML5 that you're pushing\nas where people should be going\n\n111\n00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.810\ninstead of that stuff well,\nit's got flaws in it too and some of\n\n112\n00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.380\nthose flaws are exactly the same they're\njust implemented a little differently.\n\n113\n00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.815\nSo the thing is that's where everyone's\ngoing, they there's a push to do that.\n\n114\n00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:40.005\nYou're seeing it on mobile devices and\ndifferent platforms\n\n115\n00:06:40.005 --> 00:06:44.345\nthat they're getting rid of some of this\nolder technology and going over HTML5.\n\n116\n00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:47.925\nIt's a blessing, but\nit can also be a curse in some areas too.\n\n117\n00:06:47.925 --> 00:06:51.265\nBut it's something that is out there,\nit does have flaws.\n\n118\n00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:53.815\nIt's the next generation HTML language and\n\n119\n00:06:53.815 --> 00:06:57.370\nallows you to do a lot more stuff\nthan the previous ones did.\n\n120\n00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.720\nBut it does have problems.\n\n121\n00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.600\n>> And then, of course,\nnext on your list is Adobe Flash,\n\n122\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.830\nand that was one that I actually took\nclasses in and I loved using it.\n\n123\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.230\nIt was great to make these animations and\nstuff, but as you said,\n\n124\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.850\nover the years it has been shown to\nhave quite a few vulnerabilities.\n\n125\n00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:21.620\n>> Yeah, that's one of the things\nwith Flash, I'm not gonna\n\n126\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.241\ngo as far as sit here and say hey, Flash\nis crap and you're an idiot if you use it.\n\n127\n00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:30.860\n[CROSSTALK] There's some people that\nare really that adamant about it.\n\n128\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:38.540\nI still am kind of surprised at just\nhow adamant some people are with that.\n\n129\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.940\nThey're passionate, like you've insulted\ntheir mother or something like that.\n\n130\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.920\nIt's like, you know I got something for\nyou, I'm gonna come over there.\n\n131\n00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.270\nIt's a programming language.\n\n132\n00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.330\nCalm down.\nIt's something you can use to\n\n133\n00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.290\ndo stuff with.\n\n134\n00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.318\nOr not a program,\nstuff you could do web development with.\n\n135\n00:07:56.318 --> 00:08:03.538\nYeah, it's been around for a while,\nit's got pretty long legs on it.\n\n136\n00:08:03.538 --> 00:08:07.475\nPeople have predicted its demise for\na long time.\n\n137\n00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:13.210\nAnd so you can sit here and\nsay oh well heck let's get rid of flash.\n\n138\n00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.420\nPeople have said that.\n\n139\n00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.110\nLet's get rid of it.\n\n140\n00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.432\nThey predicted that for a long time.\n\n141\n00:08:17.432 --> 00:08:18.735\nIt's still around.\n\n142\n00:08:18.735 --> 00:08:23.870\nIt's not gonna go away.\n\n143\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:28.110\nOvernight, it's gonna\ngo away at some point.\n\n144\n00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.440\nRight now we're seeing this\nmore of a push towards saying,\n\n145\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.690\nwe're just kind of sick and tired.\n\n146\n00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.040\nWe keep seeing too many flaws with it,\nthere's just issues in there\n\n147\n00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.865\nthat were It's just one of a string\nof many, and we're tired of\n\n148\n00:08:43.325 --> 00:08:47.295\nit, and I'm not gonna sit here and\nsay Flash is garbage.\n\n149\n00:08:47.295 --> 00:08:50.375\nI'll just say it's\na technology you can use.\n\n150\n00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:54.735\nIf used correctly, it's great, and\n\n151\n00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:57.405\nif people are patching\nstuff on their system and\n\n152\n00:08:57.405 --> 00:09:03.170\nkeeping that up to date,\nthey're in pretty good shape as well.\n\n153\n00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.790\nBut that's where the problem is I'd say.\n\n154\n00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.230\nWhen you look at something like Flash,\nthe problem with Flash is you get\n\n155\n00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.270\nfirst of all you get people that just,\nI like to think, overdo it.\n\n156\n00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.800\nIt's like, just because you can do\nsomething in Flash doesn't mean you need\n\n157\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.990\nto do something in Flash.\n\n158\n00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.030\nIt's like you can do a static image.\n\n159\n00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.990\nYou don't need to have stuff spinning out\nof space and stuff like that, and go, hey,\n\n160\n00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.510\nlook what I did.\n\n161\n00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.460\nIt's like most of that stuff\nlooks like garbage, and\n\n162\n00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.430\nit makes your system run like\ngarbage when it downloads it.\n\n163\n00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.640\nAnd people are getting better but\nyou still see some of that.\n\n164\n00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.140\nBut then if you take away\nthat part of the equation and\n\n165\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.218\nsay okay, well let's not\nworry about the server side.\n\n166\n00:09:41.218 --> 00:09:45.160\nAnd we know what's going on and we'll let\npeople take care of that and all that.\n\n167\n00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.620\nWell on the client side\nyou have a situation where\n\n168\n00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.440\njust about every major architecture\nout there supports flash.\n\n169\n00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.020\nAnd that's one of those things\nthat makes it a blessing but\n\n170\n00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.390\nalso makes it one heck of a curse.\n\n171\n00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.080\nBecause it is supported cross platform so\n\n172\n00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.420\nit is one of those things that\npeople are going to go to to use.\n\n173\n00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.550\nI mean that's before HTML5 came out.\n\n174\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.690\nThat was one of the big things that\npeople pushed towards because that was\n\n175\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.600\nreally the only way they\ncould do certain things.\n\n176\n00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:15.122\nJavaScript is only gonna take you so\nfar in doing stuff like ActiveX.\n\n177\n00:10:15.122 --> 00:10:18.555\nAs ActiveX was kind of\nsometimes pushed as saying hey,\n\n178\n00:10:18.555 --> 00:10:20.505\nwhy don't you do some stuff\nover here in ActiveX?\n\n179\n00:10:20.505 --> 00:10:26.205\nActiveX all other things aside it's\nMicrosoft, it's on their platform and\n\n180\n00:10:26.205 --> 00:10:28.797\nyou're pretty much to get the full\nbenefit well I know some.\n\n181\n00:10:28.797 --> 00:10:30.037\nSome people will tell me, hey,\n\n182\n00:10:30.037 --> 00:10:33.617\nyou can load plugins into this on this\noperating system, and they'll work.\n\n183\n00:10:33.617 --> 00:10:37.607\nI'm gonna say, no you can't, almost,\nbecause it doesn't work the same way.\n\n184\n00:10:37.607 --> 00:10:38.987\nIt's not giving the same experience.\n\n185\n00:10:38.987 --> 00:10:42.450\nSo that kind of takes that out.\n\n186\n00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.330\nAnd then you look at\nother stuff like Java.\n\n187\n00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.790\nSo we have JavaScript, and\nwe have ActiveX, and you got Java.\n\n188\n00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.350\nJava is, that's way,\n\n189\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:57.740\nway harder than doing something in Flash,\nso Flash was the de facto tool for this.\n\n190\n00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.630\nHTML 5's out and we're seeing that it's\nable to pick up some of this stuff.\n\n191\n00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:06.600\nAnd the duties of Flash to a pretty\nhigh degree that you're gonna see people\n\n192\n00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.040\nstart migrating over there so\nthat's something about that.\n\n193\n00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.680\nBut don't expect to have\nFlash just disappear.\n\n194\n00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.830\nIt's misused in a lot of ways.\n\n195\n00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:22.290\nPeople do poor design, use it where it's\nnot supposed to be, they don't patch it.\n\n196\n00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.470\nBut then you also get situations\nwhere it's used to do stuff,\n\n197\n00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.410\nbecause of the broad support, it's used\nto do stuff like drive-by downloads.\n\n198\n00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.520\nIt's a very popular tool for that,\n\n199\n00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.235\nbecause all you gotta do is shove\na transparent layer on top of a webpage.\n\n200\n00:11:36.235 --> 00:11:38.895\nAnd embed some scripting on it,\nwhich none of that stuff's gonna show, but\n\n201\n00:11:38.895 --> 00:11:43.005\nit will be there because most\nbrowsers do support this.\n\n202\n00:11:43.005 --> 00:11:44.055\nIt'll be there.\n\n203\n00:11:44.055 --> 00:11:45.095\nYou can't see it.\n\n204\n00:11:45.095 --> 00:11:47.815\nThe script, you definitely can't see\nit cuz it's not designed to be read, so\n\n205\n00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:50.330\nwhat happens is your page loads.\n\n206\n00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.570\nAnd you're reading the stuff and\nscrolling through it, and meanwhile,\n\n207\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.660\nit's executing script and\nshoving something down onto your computer.\n\n208\n00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:03.290\nBecause once that flash control is\na trusted thing on your system,\n\n209\n00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.720\nit's trusted to run, so\nit's getting greater access.\n\n210\n00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.350\nSo if it processes a script,\nwhatever that script does,\n\n211\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.240\nis going to inherit that access,\nand now the fun and games start.\n\n212\n00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.838\nThat's where you get\nthose drive by downloads,\n\n213\n00:12:16.838 --> 00:12:21.330\nyou get people that have\ntheir systems ratted.\n\n214\n00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.050\nYou get these remote access trojans on it.\n\n215\n00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.240\nAnd you get all sorts of things.\n\n216\n00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.890\nYou get the little\npop-up ads that come up,\n\n217\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:32.020\nand the actual hijacking of webpages and\nstuff like that.\n\n218\n00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.300\nA lot of those come just from\ndrive-by downloads from Flash.\n\n219\n00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.010\nIt's one of the reasons why some\npeople just hate it because it\n\n220\n00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.360\nexposes them to that.\n\n221\n00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.230\n>> And then we've got our\nbuffer overflow issues and\n\n222\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.720\nthis is Something that many\napplications have to deal with.\n\n223\n00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.945\nAnd that can be pretty nasty, that can\ngive system control if I'm not mistaken.\n\n224\n00:12:48.945 --> 00:12:55.882\n>> Yeah, buffer overflows are,\nonce you've found a buffer overflow and\n\n225\n00:12:55.882 --> 00:13:01.220\nknow how to exploit it, and\nthat's the tricky thing.\n\n226\n00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.390\nJust because you found a buffer\n\n227\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.890\noverflow in an application\ndoesn't mean you've got squat.\n\n228\n00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:08.460\nThey're there.\n\n229\n00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.740\nWe know they're there.\n\n230\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.060\nBut the question is that what\ncan you do at that point?\n\n231\n00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.475\nWell what you can do at the point that\nyou get that a buffer flow is yes,\n\n232\n00:13:16.475 --> 00:13:21.765\nyou can do stuff like\ngain control of a system.\n\n233\n00:13:21.765 --> 00:13:24.235\nYou can execute code there remotely.\n\n234\n00:13:24.235 --> 00:13:29.975\nI mean heck, Metasploit, we showed some\nthings that directly took advantage of\n\n235\n00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:35.615\nbuffer overflows, and so it can be an easy\nway to kick the door down in a system and\n\n236\n00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:38.180\nstarts doing all sorts of nastiness on it.\n\n237\n00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.430\nSo you do want to try to squash\nthose whenever you find it.\n\n238\n00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:47.660\nMetasploit is very good at\nfinding buffer overflows.\n\n239\n00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:53.880\nBut there's also plenty of tools that\ncan do analysis of your applications.\n\n240\n00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.630\nAnd even in the source code, and\nsay there's these problem that exist and\n\n241\n00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.030\nyou need to address them.\n\n242\n00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:04.830\nAnd buffer overflows, they're\nsomething that can be addressed, for\n\n243\n00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.760\none thing,\nthrough secure coding principles.\n\n244\n00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:13.840\nMost companies nowadays, the short\nblurb on that secure coding, is that\n\n245\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:19.280\nsecure coding practices are something that\nare best practices and guidelines and\n\n246\n00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.900\neven full manuals that the different\nvendors put out saying this is what you do\n\n247\n00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:30.120\nwhen you use our product to make, to code\nthings and develop things in a safer way.\n\n248\n00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.850\nAnd they expect you to look at that and\neven build on it if you have to.\n\n249\n00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:38.908\nSo, you can look at thinks\nlike Microsoft has them.\n\n250\n00:14:38.908 --> 00:14:39.670\nOracle has them.\n\n251\n00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.270\nI mean, there's tons of them out there.\n\n252\n00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:47.245\nSo if you look at those things, and really\nkind of pay attention to what's going on\n\n253\n00:14:47.245 --> 00:14:51.670\nand their guidance, you can probably get\nrid of a good amount of buffer overflows.\n\n254\n00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.470\nBut again, to go back to the early\nstuff with application development.\n\n255\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:56.480\nRemember one of the things we said,\n\n256\n00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.190\none of the tough things about\nit was the complexities.\n\n257\n00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.190\nWe'll talk about complexities here.\n\n258\n00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:05.130\nIf you write an application for\nthe Windows platform,\n\n259\n00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:09.980\nI don't care what secure coding\npractices you follow, thing's 100%.\n\n260\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.943\nYou still have to worry about\nthe vulnerabilities in the OS.\n\n261\n00:15:12.943 --> 00:15:18.480\nYeah, so, and some of the things that\nyou use inside your application,\n\n262\n00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.170\nthat they look like they're\npart of that application.\n\n263\n00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.800\nBut if you know how things work,\n\n264\n00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.240\nit's something that that application\ndoesn't have built into it.\n\n265\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.540\nIt's something that it just makes\na call to Windows and says,\n\n266\n00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.920\ndisplay this, like a print dialog.\n\n267\n00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.750\nIn most applications,\n\n268\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:39.580\nthat print dialog doesn't actually\nexist as the way I put it.\n\n269\n00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:44.052\nYou hit print and\nit makes an API call to the system and\n\n270\n00:15:44.052 --> 00:15:48.433\ndisplays stuff that allows\nyou to do stuff with it.\n\n271\n00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:50.760\nSame thing with opening a dialog,\n\n272\n00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.702\nit's gonna make a call to\nthe operating system to do that.\n\n273\n00:15:54.702 --> 00:15:59.459\nSo it doesn't need to carry that type of\nstuff, so There's your complexity again,\n\n274\n00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:04.149\nand that's where heck, you iron out the\nbuffer overflows, you do secure coding,\n\n275\n00:16:04.149 --> 00:16:08.860\nwell what about all the other stuff people\nwere doing, around what you were doing?\n\n276\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.550\nYou have to worry about that.\n\n277\n00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.970\n>> I remember a few years ago, in fact,\n\n278\n00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:16.470\nthe IP printer service was a victim\nof buffer overflow attacks.\n\n279\n00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.790\nAnd just for those of you that might\nnot be familiar with buffer overflow,\n\n280\n00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.700\nan application is assigned a certain\nblock of memory that it's allowed\n\n281\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.840\nto use to store its own code\nthat the program's executing and\n\n282\n00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.580\nany data, things like that we might\nbe entering and what-have you.\n\n283\n00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:34.690\nAnd a buffer overflow attack is when you\ntry to fill up, let's say it was a sign,\n\n284\n00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:39.420\nyou can almost think of it like a cup\nis the early example that I always use.\n\n285\n00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.010\nThis application has a cup that\nit can store things in and\n\n286\n00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:47.000\nif I just dump enough data into that\napplication, I fill that cup up and\n\n287\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.020\nnow whatever I dump in has to overflow\nto the next address in memory and\n\n288\n00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:57.420\nthen if I can call that address I can get\nthat executed with system level access.\n\n289\n00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.190\nSo, the program needs to be able\nto not allow that to happen.\n\n290\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.030\nYou're going to get system level access\nwhere you can cause the program to crash.\n\n291\n00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.730\nSo then there's a lot of programs\nthat are vulnerable to that.\n\n292\n00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:14.220\n>> Yeah, for all intents and purposes,\nevery piece of code you'll find out there\n\n293\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.460\nhas the potential or\nalready has a buffer overflow in it.\n\n294\n00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.080\nI have a similar example with that I\nuse the, I like to joke around and\n\n295\n00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.650\ncall it the ice cube tray model\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:26.720\n>> You know where you're pouring,\n\n297\n00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.890\nwater in one of the compartments and\nit spills over someplace else.\n\n298\n00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.940\nI say those next things represent\nthe next address space Same thing.\n\n299\n00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.668\nHalf a dozen, six on the other.\n\n300\n00:17:35.668 --> 00:17:36.225\n>> I like that one.\n\n301\n00:17:36.225 --> 00:17:37.050\nI'm going to steal it from you.\n\n302\n00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.712\n[LAUGH]\n>> Go for it.\n\n303\n00:17:38.712 --> 00:17:39.534\nIt's easy to draw.\n\n304\n00:17:39.534 --> 00:17:42.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n305\n00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.360\nit illustrates the point of\nwhat's going on with this.\n\n306\n00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.480\nMike's exactly right, once it executes,\nand you can actually do this successfully,\n\n307\n00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.300\nyou can grab all sorts of privileges,\nyou can run all sorts of code.\n\n308\n00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:00.180\nI can have your application running,\ngrab the baton from it,\n\n309\n00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.320\nrun my stuff, and then pass it back to\nyour application, let it continue running.\n\n310\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.290\nSo I just launched my application with\nthe privileges that yours has and so\n\n311\n00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.920\nI'm doing my stuff while yours continues\noff just sailing off into the sunset and\n\n312\n00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.150\nyou're none the wiser.\n\n313\n00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.120\n>> Exactly.\n\n314\n00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.140\nAnd then memory leaks.\n\n315\n00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:21.200\nThat's another one that is not a good\nthing and a lot of applications\n\n316\n00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:27.220\nsuffer from this, and it's a frustrating\none because it makes my system so slow.\n\n317\n00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.455\n>> I found out in my experience if\ntoo much Percocet, memory leak.\n\n318\n00:18:30.455 --> 00:18:31.924\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not that I would do that,\n\n319\n00:18:31.924 --> 00:18:33.417\nI'm just kidding,\nI would never take that stuff.\n\n320\n00:18:33.417 --> 00:18:38.632\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So anyway, but memory leak is something\n\n321\n00:18:38.632 --> 00:18:43.890\nthat happens really on any sort of\napplication can also have this.\n\n322\n00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.330\nA memory leak, simply put,\nis just when you're using an application,\n\n323\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:52.380\nover time you notice that it\nstarts sucking up more and\n\n324\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.100\nmore memory on the system until eventually\nyou're like, where'd all my memory go?\n\n325\n00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:59.110\n>> It's supposed to release it at\na point if it's not being used anymore.\n\n326\n00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.390\nEvery time he launched the application\nit didn't release from last time and\n\n327\n00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.133\nit just grabbed more and more and more and\n\n328\n00:19:04.133 --> 00:19:06.916\npretty soon this one application\nis using all eight gigs of ram.\n\n329\n00:19:06.916 --> 00:19:11.572\n>> Yeah it's 100% what\nthe case is right there.\n\n330\n00:19:11.572 --> 00:19:17.709\nSome systems are better at it,\nsome applications are better at it,\n\n331\n00:19:17.709 --> 00:19:24.386\nbut I had and still have individuals\nI know that do software development,\n\n332\n00:19:24.386 --> 00:19:30.230\ntelling me, it's just every\napplication's going to have it.\n\n333\n00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:34.040\nThis is every application, no matter\nwhere it is, has a memory leak problem.\n\n334\n00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:34.855\nAny questions?\n\n335\n00:19:34.855 --> 00:19:35.760\n[LAUGH] That's the way they put it.\n\n336\n00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.470\n>> Just hope that it's small enough that\nit doesn't, eventually, it's Windows,\n\n337\n00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.730\nwe're going to reboot it at some point,\nright, and that should clean all that up.\n\n338\n00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:48.280\n>> And you know that's actually\na very good one to point out,\n\n339\n00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.010\nbecause you look at really,\nand it's not only Windows,\n\n340\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.785\nbut you look at servers,\nwhen you ask people\n\n341\n00:19:55.785 --> 00:19:58.315\nwhen's the last time they rebooted\nthe server, like the Windows server.\n\n342\n00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:01.245\nWhen's the last time they rebooted it?\n\n343\n00:20:01.245 --> 00:20:03.205\nYou get all these wild claims and\nstuff like that.\n\n344\n00:20:03.205 --> 00:20:08.042\nWell, oh yeah, I haven't rebooted it\nin such and such a length of time.\n\n345\n00:20:08.042 --> 00:20:11.712\nI'd say almost if they haven't\nrebooted it in the last six months or\n\n346\n00:20:11.712 --> 00:20:12.624\nsomething like that-\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n347\n00:20:12.624 --> 00:20:13.901\n>> [CROSSTALK] you have on that thing?\n\n348\n00:20:13.901 --> 00:20:16.107\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's like what's going on.\n\n349\n00:20:16.107 --> 00:20:18.802\nYeah, there's a lot of\nthings wrong with that.\n\n350\n00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:23.562\nBut one of the reasons why,\nand it's not the only reason,\n\n351\n00:20:24.652 --> 00:20:30.160\nis when we reboot systems, if nothing else\nis going on, no other reason to reboot it,\n\n352\n00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.110\nIt's because to get it to clean up\nstuff and reinitialize everything.\n\n353\n00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.930\nWhen you hear look on the Linux, one of\nthe things that Linux people have said for\n\n354\n00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:42.690\na long time is that, hey,\nonce I update something\n\n355\n00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:47.400\non the system I have to reboot far\nless if ever than a Windows box does.\n\n356\n00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.260\nThen they'll tell you, oh, I've left\nthis system on for all this time and\n\n357\n00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.890\nI'm still keeping everything up to date.\n\n358\n00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.280\nOkay, that's fine, but\nwhat about the other stuff?\n\n359\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.400\nWhat about the memory leaks that\nare going to come with that?\n\n360\n00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.630\nBecause that suffers from it too.\n\n361\n00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:04.530\nThis isn't something that Microsoft\ndidn't invent memory leaks.\n\n362\n00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:05.980\nIt's something that's just been there.\n\n363\n00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:14.200\nTechnically, if an application and all\nthe stuff around it is coded correctly and\n\n364\n00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.700\nfollowing all the good practices,\nthis shouldn't happen, but\n\n365\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.770\nthat's the theoretical.\n\n366\n00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.760\nThe practical is different from that.\n\n367\n00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:27.440\nThey should be doing, and I know a lot of\ndevelopers call it garbage collection,\n\n368\n00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.110\nis when they're done, they're releasing\nstuff back they call it doing garbage\n\n369\n00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.400\ncollection, clear that stuff out and\nrelease it back.\n\n370\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.750\nI don't need it anymore.\n\n371\n00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:38.510\nBut those routines may not be good or\nthey may not be present at all and\n\n372\n00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.640\nthat leads to having\na memory leak eventually.\n\n373\n00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.580\nIt gets bigger and bigger and\n\n374\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.730\nbigger until eventually you know it's\npushing other stuff out of memory and\n\n375\n00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:50.980\nthen you see a lot of swapping and the\nsystem gets slower, and we've all seen it.\n\n376\n00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.050\nEvery last one of us has seen it.\n\n377\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:57.480\nEither we recognized it right away or we\njust saw that, hey that's kinda strange,\n\n378\n00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.750\nwhy is it doing that?\n\n379\n00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:03.340\nYou can look in task manager for example,\nand look at some of the stuff in Windows\n\n380\n00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.445\ntrying to boot the computer, look at the\nstuff, look at the size of some of these\n\n381\n00:22:06.445 --> 00:22:08.693\nprocesses that run in\nthe background by default.\n\n382\n00:22:08.693 --> 00:22:13.930\nThem come back and look at it maybe in an\nhour or two or something after using it,\n\n383\n00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:18.080\nand watch that you haven't touched that\nthing and maybe have nothing running,\n\n384\n00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:23.370\nwhat was taking up maybe four\nmegs is now all of sudden at 100.\n\n385\n00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.580\nBrowsers do that all the time.\n\n386\n00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.416\nBrowsers seem to be huge\noffenders in that area.\n\n387\n00:22:28.416 --> 00:22:29.125\n>> Chrome.\n\n388\n00:22:29.125 --> 00:22:32.010\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I didn't say it.\n\n389\n00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.050\nI agree with it, but I didn't say it.\n\n390\n00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.521\nAnd I'm kind of upset I didn't say it.\n\n391\n00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:36.166\n[LAUGH]\n>> But yeah,\n\n392\n00:22:36.166 --> 00:22:39.607\nI mean I've written a couple simple,\ngoofy applications and\n\n393\n00:22:39.607 --> 00:22:43.245\nthere's a lot of extra lines that\nyou've got to dump in there to,\n\n394\n00:22:43.245 --> 00:22:46.120\nokay now I'm going to\nthrow this variable out.\n\n395\n00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.730\nThis is all stuff that gets stored in\nmemory and if I don't release it properly\n\n396\n00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.380\nit's just going to eat up memory slowly\nover time and as you said eventually,\n\n397\n00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:57.372\nwhich leads us to our next topic\nthere,which is Research Exhaustion,\n\n398\n00:22:57.372 --> 00:22:59.910\nin which memory leak is\ndefinitely kind of one of those.\n\n399\n00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.270\n>> A memory leak is absolutely\none type of resource exhaustion,\n\n400\n00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.290\nbut you're using up something to the point\nwhere there's either not enough to go\n\n401\n00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:13.780\naround or none to go around,\nand that's really bad.\n\n402\n00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:18.795\nWhat we can have when you have resource\nexhaustion, memory being one, another one,\n\n403\n00:23:18.795 --> 00:23:25.560\nanother one we see often\nenough is CPU usage.\n\n404\n00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.830\nCPU usage, you'll see where they peg\nthe processor 100%, what's going on,\n\n405\n00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:33.820\nsomething monopolized that, and that\njust starts causing your performance to\n\n406\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:38.650\ngo off a cliff, so\nyou have to do something about that.\n\n407\n00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:45.183\nMany operating systems have tools to\nhandle that, but also good program design,\n\n408\n00:23:45.183 --> 00:23:50.294\nbeing proactive about stopping\nit before I have to clue, John,\n\n409\n00:23:50.294 --> 00:23:55.121\nsome stuff on the back end to fix\nit is a much better solution,\n\n410\n00:23:55.121 --> 00:23:57.699\nso that's just two forms of it.\n\n411\n00:23:57.699 --> 00:24:02.579\nWe also have things that can use network\nbandwidth, they can just suck it up\n\n412\n00:24:02.579 --> 00:24:06.615\nto the point where it's gone\nHard drive space, another one.\n\n413\n00:24:06.615 --> 00:24:11.240\nBut really anything can be that\nwe need to run an application.\n\n414\n00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:16.680\nIt could be a case where you get\nover utilization of resources or\n\n415\n00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.380\nthere are just none to go around.\n\n416\n00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.670\nI've seen it so many cases.\n\n417\n00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:26.439\nAnd the thing about resource\nexhaustion over utilizing it,\n\n418\n00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:32.960\nwhen you get to that point,\nit may not actually be a situation\n\n419\n00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:38.720\nwhere you can immediately just say,\nyeah, something's failing here or\n\n420\n00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.000\nthere's a problem here, cuz I don't have\nany more of these things to do around.\n\n421\n00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.982\nIt may not be as obvious as that.\n\n422\n00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:47.236\nIt could be,\na manifest as some weird error message and\n\n423\n00:24:47.236 --> 00:24:49.370\nyou're just what the heck is that?\n\n424\n00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:50.780\nI haven't seen that before.\n\n425\n00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:55.810\nI've seen like what GDI messages you\nknow way back for the graphic system and\n\n426\n00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:59.370\nother things that doesn't make sense.\n\n427\n00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:00.690\nWhy is that popping up?\n\n428\n00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.530\nAnd then your re-boot goes away.\n\n429\n00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:03.590\nOkay it's fine.\n\n430\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.570\nAnd then it pops up again.\n\n431\n00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.590\nDidn't we just go through this.\n\n432\n00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:11.480\nSo that causes well at\na lot of us still do,\n\n433\n00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.890\nlet's just reboot it and\nsee if it goes away.\n\n434\n00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:17.970\nEven though we know that's not\nalways the cure all for it.\n\n435\n00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.700\nWe do that because it does help in\na lot of cases but it comes back.\n\n436\n00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.740\nOkay and why is that happening?\n\n437\n00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.360\nAnd now as you do a closer examination and\n\n438\n00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:31.730\nyour seeing no well it's because\nthere's not enough memory over here.\n\n439\n00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.800\nSomething is sucking it all up over here.\n\n440\n00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.360\nAnd so this one doesn't have enough.\n\n441\n00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.010\nAnd the way it's dealing with it,\nis it's throwing out that error message,\n\n442\n00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.460\nmaybe cuz it can't execute a process or\nsomething.\n\n443\n00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.090\nAnd that's a case of that process failing,\nthrowing an error message.\n\n444\n00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.840\nAnd it's actually just a red herring,\n\n445\n00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.130\ntaking you in another direction\nwhen that's not the real problem.\n\n446\n00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.680\n>> Absolutely, and I know you\nmentioned GDI, I think one of the 3D\n\n447\n00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.040\nrendering engines that I was using was one\nof those applications where it would grab\n\n448\n00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.590\nas much processor as it could, didn't care\nwhat else was running on your system and\n\n449\n00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.700\nit was an older system and\nit would choke it up for sure.\n\n450\n00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.500\nSomething you gotta pay attention to, you\ngotta look, we've got like in Windows for\n\n451\n00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.740\nexample, it's very easy.\n\n452\n00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:15.870\nOpen up your Task Manager, go to that\nPerformance node or the Processes node and\n\n453\n00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:19.830\ntake a look at which one it\nis that's taking all the CPU.\n\n454\n00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.690\nWhich one is it that's sucking up\nall your memory or all your disk or\n\n455\n00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.710\nall your network?\n\n456\n00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:28.060\nAnd then we can either not use that\napplication or if it's something we wrote,\n\n457\n00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.670\nmaybe there's something we've gotta tweak\nin the code to make it stop doing that.\n\n458\n00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:32.780\nSo a lot of good information there.\n\n459\n00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.450\nAgain, we've taken a good hard look at\na lot of different issues that we've had\n\n460\n00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.250\nwith applications and\nespecially web applications.\n\n461\n00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.180\nGood information Sean.\n\n462\n00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.140\nAnything else we want to throw into\nthis one before we wrap it up?\n\n463\n00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:48.950\n>> One last thing here to quickly throw in\nat the end of this resource exhaustion,\n\n464\n00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:50.230\nmemory leaks.\n\n465\n00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:54.780\nIs if you suspect that that is\nwhat happening on your system,\n\n466\n00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.980\ndon't just start going and opening up\nTask Manager, or process lists, or\n\n467\n00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.405\nsomething and start killing stuff.\n\n468\n00:27:00.405 --> 00:27:02.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've seen that happen, and\n\n469\n00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.800\nit's almost always\na stupid idea to do that.\n\n470\n00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.820\nBecause unless you really know what\nit is that you're shutting down or\n\n471\n00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:15.690\nmonkeying with,\nyou can get stuff to happen that is just,\n\n472\n00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.240\nthat shouldn't be, or you'll blame\non another application, saying oh,\n\n473\n00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.130\nwell that application is garbage.\n\n474\n00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.434\nIt's like, no, you're sitting there\nkicking the chair out from underneath it\n\n475\n00:27:24.434 --> 00:27:25.709\nwhen it's trying to sit down.\n\n476\n00:27:25.709 --> 00:27:26.631\nWhat do you expect it to do?\n\n477\n00:27:26.631 --> 00:27:27.776\nIt's gonna crash.\n\n478\n00:27:27.776 --> 00:27:33.630\nSo, I think about one application I\nworked with a while back that was for\n\n479\n00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:37.631\ndoing saw in modeling and\nwhat it had when it did,\n\n480\n00:27:37.631 --> 00:27:41.828\nit jogged my memory when\nyou said about rendering,\n\n481\n00:27:41.828 --> 00:27:45.750\nbecause this product did\nreal time rendering.\n\n482\n00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.690\nYou could spin the stuff in real time,\nand the lights and\n\n483\n00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.470\neverything would change position\ndepending on what material you had,\n\n484\n00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.060\nyou owed each other,\npush the sparkle or everything on it.\n\n485\n00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.270\nIt's really quite neat.\n\n486\n00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.210\nAs you can imagine, there's a lot\n\n487\n00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.950\nof horsepower involved in\ndoing something like that.\n\n488\n00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:04.140\nSo what it did is it had in the background\nthere was another process that this\n\n489\n00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:09.640\napplication would spawn and\nwould do hidden line removal and\n\n490\n00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:14.580\ndo a real time lighting and\nall that on it, it was this,\n\n491\n00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.890\nso, it looked really cool but it required,\nyou know, a horsepower to do it.\n\n492\n00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.610\nAnd, that horsepower came in\nthe form of extra memory and\n\n493\n00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.280\nextra processor that was required.\n\n494\n00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:30.508\nI remember, when I was working with that,\nhaving a, a client call and say,\n\n495\n00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:37.080\nthis part is having just a ton\nof problems with it because\n\n496\n00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:42.150\nit keeps crashing and it keeps trying\nto suck more memory on the system,\n\n497\n00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:48.240\nway more than it should and it's like,\nokay let's see what's going on.\n\n498\n00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.280\nIndeed was when he looked\nat his memory just alone,\n\n499\n00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.830\nhe had a quite a bit of memory on\nhis system, it was disappearing,\n\n500\n00:28:55.830 --> 00:29:02.110\na lot of it was disappearing, many more\nthan the host application was taking up.\n\n501\n00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.437\nAnd what he was looking at,\n\n502\n00:29:03.437 --> 00:29:07.077\nhe was looking off the side another\napplication that happened to be one that\n\n503\n00:29:07.077 --> 00:29:10.840\nthe saw modeler spawned to do all\nthis stuff Mike it was talking about.\n\n504\n00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.500\nIt was going through\ndoing all of this stuff.\n\n505\n00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.020\nAs the model got more complex and\nhad more fasts and stuff like that on it,\n\n506\n00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.370\nshow up and\ndifferent materials start getting mixed,\n\n507\n00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.130\nit was causing that\nprocess to do more work.\n\n508\n00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.060\nSo it's sucking up more processor\nbecause that needs that and\n\n509\n00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.080\nit was taking up more memory\nbecause it needs to do that.\n\n510\n00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.500\nAnd it was creating\nstuff on the hard drive.\n\n511\n00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.250\nBut if you looked at the software\nthat we had shipped out,\n\n512\n00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:38.760\nthat was where he said that if you\ncreate a model at certain sizes,\n\n513\n00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.690\nyou're gonna have to start bumping up your\nmemory to certain levels, and we gave\n\n514\n00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:46.430\nreally strict recommendations and said\nthat hey, you need to at least have this.\n\n515\n00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.612\nThis guy was like oh I don't have\nenough memory, just kill that process.\n\n516\n00:29:48.612 --> 00:29:53.130\nEvery time he did it,\nit would just shut down that process.\n\n517\n00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:55.170\nIt would interfere with\nthat real time rendering.\n\n518\n00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.000\nAnd what it would do is it would try\nto respond and he'd kill it again.\n\n519\n00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.420\nHe did it enough times the application\nwould say something's going wrong here,\n\n520\n00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.060\nand it would crash the whole thing.\n\n521\n00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:08.960\nHence his calls to me going you guys got\na nasty memory leak on your application,\n\n522\n00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.350\nand I keep shutting this\ndown to get the memory back.\n\n523\n00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.495\nAnd I look again 20 minutes later\nit's sucking up all its memory again.\n\n524\n00:30:14.495 --> 00:30:16.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like how much memory do you have and\n\n525\n00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:16.990\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n526\n00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.363\nIt was him doing it\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n527\n00:30:18.363 --> 00:30:18.960\n>> It was him doing it.\n\n528\n00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.770\nHe was doing it over and he was It\nwas basically going through there and\n\n529\n00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:25.800\ndoing it, and sabotaging himself.\n\n530\n00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.860\nThe application was doing\nwhat it was supposed to.\n\n531\n00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.410\nIt didn't have a memory\nleak in that situation.\n\n532\n00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:37.350\nIt was just him saying oh well he didn't\nthink that that was the way that it should\n\n533\n00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.880\noperate.\n\n534\n00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.020\nIt looked out of the ordinary to to him.\n\n535\n00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.530\n>> We should-\n>> Wasn't an idiot by the way.\n\n536\n00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.500\nHe knew what, he was a a smart guy.\n\n537\n00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.580\nHe was a case of that he\ndidn't know what that did and\n\n538\n00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.080\nhe just did what he'd always done.\n\n539\n00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.480\nThat's taking up too much memory, kill it.\n\n540\n00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.480\nI'm using this program over here and\ni know what this is and\n\n541\n00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.980\nI don't know what that is.\n\n542\n00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.320\nI'm just gonna get rid of it.\n\n543\n00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.265\n>> That's one of the good old PEBCAKs.\n\n544\n00:30:57.265 --> 00:30:59.740\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I remember after I told him,\n\n545\n00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.440\nhe was like I feel really dumb.\n\n546\n00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.790\nI'm like hey, it happens.\n\n547\n00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:05.965\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> I mean you're dumb,\nbut it happens.\n\n548\n00:31:05.965 --> 00:31:08.640\n[LAUGH] No, he was a good guy.\n\n549\n00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.200\n>> A lot great information.\n\n550\n00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.050\nGood episode there Sean.\n\n551\n00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:12.830\nBut that's going to do it for this one.\n\n552\n00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.700\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n553\n00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:16.640\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n554\n00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.288\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n555\n00:31:18.288 --> 00:31:18.788\n[SOUND]\n\n",

Roderick.\n\n3\n00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.083\nWith me today is Mr.\nSean Oriyano, how you doing Sean?\n\n4\n00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.000\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing today?\n\n5\n00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.090\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n6\n00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.470\nExcited because we have more\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner\n\n7\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.350\ncoming your way and in this one, we're\ngoing to be talking about pen testing or\n\n8\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.050\npenetration testing, I guess I should\nsay the full name there the first time.\n\n9\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.580\nBut, this is something that we've\ngot to have in our bag of tools,\n\n10\n00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.500\nwhen it comes to designing\na secure network, right?\n\n11\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.090\n>> Yeah, absolutely, as it's such\na valuable part of determining\n\n12\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.600\nwhat your security stance actually is.\n\n13\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.730\nBecause without it, yeah,\nyou can do audits and\n\n14\n00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.110\nyou can do vulnerability scanning and\nstuff like that, but\n\n15\n00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.641\nthat's not really going up\nto the level of pentesting.\n\n16\n00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:02.250\nPentesting is much more aggressive,\nit's much more realistic.\n\n17\n00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.240\n>> And it's something that's gonna give\nyou results that you can actually work on,\n\n18\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.620\nthat you can see that this is what's\nhappening in my system, this is what\n\n19\n00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.180\na black hat would see, and it's trying\nto go in and get in and cause damage.\n\n20\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.110\nSo it's a really good way to do things.\n\n21\n00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.470\nBut it's not something that's\nappropriate for every situation.\n\n22\n00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.720\nIt's something you gotta realize\nthat aside form the intention,\n\n23\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.360\nthe fact that I'm authorized by you, I\nhave your blessing as a client to do this,\n\n24\n00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.110\nif I'm coming as a pen tester.\n\n25\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.400\nThat's the exact same tools and\ntechniques.\n\n26\n00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.413\nSo that translates to, if something\nbad is gonna happen with black hats,\n\n27\n00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:43.143\nsomething bad is gonna\nhappen when I'm doing it.\n\n28\n00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:45.989\nSo there's a possibility-\n>> Doesn't matter whose doing it whether\n\n29\n00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:48.622\nI'm meaning to be malicious or\nI'm doing this for\n\n30\n00:01:48.622 --> 00:01:50.701\na good reason the results are the same.\n\n31\n00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:52.349\n>> Yeah,exactly.\n\n32\n00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.400\n>> Yep, so really pen-testing can\ndo a couple things for us, right?\n\n33\n00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.044\nI mean it can show us where\nwe're still vulnerable.\n\n34\n00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:03.568\nIt can also be a way to verify all\nthe hard work that I put in to designing\n\n35\n00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:04.740\na secure system.\n\n36\n00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.530\nAnd it gave me a way to\nverify the results, or\n\n37\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.525\nto say look I really did do\na good job securing this.\n\n38\n00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:12.380\n>> Yeah, it's a sanity check really,\nor trust but verify,\n\n39\n00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.990\nif you wanna use that one.\n\n40\n00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.430\nThat's exactly what it is.\n\n41\n00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.360\nNothing's saying that as a pen\ntester I have to find a problem.\n\n42\n00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.120\nThat's part of the thing, is that I've\ndone pen tests within the parameters\n\n43\n00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.370\nthat they've given me,\nI haven't found any major issues.\n\n44\n00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.895\nI've found maybe some medium level ones,\nand some kind of like, hey FYI.\n\n45\n00:02:36.895 --> 00:02:42.585\nBut I didn't find anything that was really\nmajor, those clients come back to me,\n\n46\n00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:45.560\nand they're like you didn't find anything,\nany big problems.\n\n47\n00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.190\nI'm like, well,\nI'm sure there's big problems,\n\n48\n00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.100\nbecause I can see it's kind of peeking\nout a bit and I kind of indicated that.\n\n49\n00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.210\nBut within the parameters you gave me,\nI can't go after and\n\n50\n00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.410\nstrike against those,\nbecause it wasn't authorized to do it.\n\n51\n00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.827\nAnd so I'll usually have a discussion\nwith them before I get to that point,\n\n52\n00:03:05.827 --> 00:03:08.213\nsaying I think there was\nan area of concern here, and\n\n53\n00:03:08.213 --> 00:03:10.561\nI'll tell you why I think\nit's an area of concern.\n\n54\n00:03:10.561 --> 00:03:13.100\nDo you want me to do that?\n\n55\n00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.560\nThis is what could happen.\n\n56\n00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.870\nOr do you want me to leave it off limits\nand let, and just say, hey I found it.\n\n57\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.320\nAnd you can pass it on your IT guys or\nwhomever.\n\n58\n00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.726\n>> That's nice of you.\n\n59\n00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:27.530\nI've found a buff where you might be\nsusceptible to a buffer overflow attack,\n\n60\n00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.810\nbut I didn't actually perform the attack\nand bring your entire system down and\n\n61\n00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.430\nshut your e-commerce system down.\n\n62\n00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.012\nSo that's a good thing, thank you, Sean.\n\n63\n00:03:34.012 --> 00:03:35.928\n>> Try that with a black hat.\n\n64\n00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:37.297\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n65\n00:03:37.297 --> 00:03:37.900\n>> Yeah,\n\n66\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.340\nthat's a the thing that you've\ngot to realize when you do this.\n\n67\n00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.130\nThe dangers are the same.\n\n68\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.523\nWhat might actually kind of pull you away\nfrom having the same level of danger is\n\n69\n00:03:49.523 --> 00:03:54.250\nwhat you were talking about Mike,\n\n70\n00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.700\nis that, hey, thanks for\nletting us know, but not doing it.\n\n71\n00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.468\nThat's one of the benefits\nyou get with a pen tester.\n\n72\n00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:05.430\nIf I'm pen testing for you and I find\na problem, if I think it's bad enough,\n\n73\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.900\nI'm going to use my judgment to say,\nI know this is an issue,\n\n74\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.630\nI see all the hallmarks and\nfingerprints all over this.\n\n75\n00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.930\nBefore I do anything,\n\n76\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.940\nmaybe I want to talk to the client to say,\ndo you want me to really do this?\n\n77\n00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.320\nBecause I can cause significant\namount of damage doing this.\n\n78\n00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.050\nAnd so, they can decide yeah okay,\nwe want to see how bad it can be cuz\n\n79\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.740\nwe want to test maybe our\nincident response as well.\n\n80\n00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.438\nIf they're fine with that, then, okay.\n\n81\n00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.512\n>> Sean's eyes light up and\nhe starts doing this with his hands and\n\n82\n00:04:34.512 --> 00:04:35.623\nthis maniacal laugh.\n\n83\n00:04:35.623 --> 00:04:36.285\n>> Excellent.\n\n84\n00:04:36.285 --> 00:04:40.508\n>> Yeah [LAUGH]\n>> See that's where I come in,\n\n85\n00:04:40.508 --> 00:04:42.866\nI get the cat out,\nlet's take this to the next level.\n\n86\n00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:49.409\n[LAUGH] So, but it is something that yeah\nyou got to realize it can happen, but\n\n87\n00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:54.418\nyou also, on that same token,\nif I'm doing something and\n\n88\n00:04:54.418 --> 00:05:00.610\nstuff starts to negatively impact you,\nyou've got me on the hotline.\n\n89\n00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.490\nYou can call me up, yeah,\nstop whatever you're doing.\n\n90\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.125\nWhat you're doing, why justified,\nthey'll say something that you're\n\n91\n00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:15.314\ndoing is having much more far-reaching\neffects than we would like,\n\n92\n00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:18.274\nso you need to stop what you're doing.\n\n93\n00:05:18.274 --> 00:05:23.200\n>> Exactly, so now when we look at pen\ntesting, there's different what we\n\n94\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.320\ncall box methods that we can use,\nand so how do we break those down?\n\n95\n00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.130\n>> Yeah, there's really three types\n\n96\n00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.460\nof boxes that you have that\nyou can put your test within.\n\n97\n00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.787\nAnd you don't know what box you're in\nuntil you actually observe it, okay.\n\n98\n00:05:39.787 --> 00:05:42.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Schroedinger's Cat.\n\n99\n00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.268\n[CROSSTALK] That's right.\n\n100\n00:05:43.268 --> 00:05:44.916\nIt's Friday and I'm pulling that stuff.\n\n101\n00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:46.008\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You miss it?\n\n102\n00:05:46.008 --> 00:05:46.670\nToo bad.\n\n103\n00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.188\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm still gonna get you that shirt that\n\n104\n00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:53.416\nhas the Schroedinger's cat wanted dead and\nalive.\n\n105\n00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:55.133\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n106\n00:05:55.133 --> 00:06:00.158\nI know of, what we got black box,\n\n107\n00:06:00.158 --> 00:06:03.577\nwhite box, gray box.\n\n108\n00:06:03.577 --> 00:06:04.099\nTell us about those guys.\n\n109\n00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.244\n>> Those are the three big\nones you're gonna run into.\n\n110\n00:06:08.244 --> 00:06:12.178\nTo be fair there's other forms of tests\nyou can do that don't fit the category of\n\n111\n00:06:12.178 --> 00:06:14.305\none of these traditional box categories.\n\n112\n00:06:14.305 --> 00:06:18.494\nAnd feel free to explore\nthose if you want.\n\n113\n00:06:18.494 --> 00:06:24.264\nOne of the reasons why I wouldn't discuss\nthem in a place like this, is because\n\n114\n00:06:24.264 --> 00:06:29.511\nthere's still a lot of disagreement,\nnot like nasty disagreements,\n\n115\n00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:34.496\nbut there's disagreements on\nare those actual separate tests, or\n\n116\n00:06:34.496 --> 00:06:39.216\nare those just a variation on\na theme with the black, white, and\n\n117\n00:06:39.216 --> 00:06:42.090\nthe gray, you know, so.\n\n118\n00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.010\nJust keep that in mind,\n\n119\n00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.660\nif you're seeing it go well wait a minute,\nthere's a big long list of tests here.\n\n120\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.780\nI see, I've searched on the Internet and\nfound them.\n\n121\n00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.280\nNot saying you're wrong, I'm just saying\nthat that's another way of looking at it.\n\n122\n00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.440\nBut the three we've got when we look at\nthose, we have a black box, which means,\n\n123\n00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.070\nyou don't have really information or\nis extremely limited,\n\n124\n00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:10.530\nmeaning that they can give you parameters\non striking out on a target to strike.\n\n125\n00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.462\nSaying okay, well this is the company,\nand this is our IP address and that's it.\n\n126\n00:07:14.462 --> 00:07:16.600\nThat's all you're getting.\n\n127\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.930\nAnd then they can go all the way to\nthe other extreme with the white box,\n\n128\n00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.680\nit's where you have full knowledge and\nfull disclosure.\n\n129\n00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.770\nBoth of those have their time and place.\n\n130\n00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.440\nA black box is going to simulate\nexactly what an attacker would see,\n\n131\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.080\nwhereas a white box is going to be\n\n132\n00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.910\ninternally you doing a sanity check\non whatever it is you implemented.\n\n133\n00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.180\nNow, that still leaves us with one\nright there which is the grey box,\n\n134\n00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.880\nwhich, you figure just by the name,\nit's in between the two.\n\n135\n00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:51.910\nSo, it must mean that we have\npartial knowledge, but not full.\n\n136\n00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.216\nWhat the heck would that do?\n\n137\n00:07:53.216 --> 00:07:58.254\nIt seems like if you've got partial\nknowledge, isn't that a bad thing?\n\n138\n00:07:58.254 --> 00:08:02.280\nIsn't that something that's tainting what\nyou're gonna go in either direction,\n\n139\n00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.408\ncuz you're not keeping anything from it,\nand you're not, so.\n\n140\n00:08:05.408 --> 00:08:09.772\nYou're not doing what a black hat would do\nbut you're not going all the way to white\n\n141\n00:08:09.772 --> 00:08:13.220\nhat and giving me everything,\nso why would I do that?\n\n142\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:19.120\nWell, we could go down many different\nroads with why you do that,\n\n143\n00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.860\nbut one of the biggest ones is that if,\nlet's say I'm doing a black box test,\n\n144\n00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.140\nit's more than likely gonna\nhappen in this situation.\n\n145\n00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.780\nIf you do a pure black box test,\n\n146\n00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.070\nthe kind of assumption is that you're\ngonna find out everything, and\n\n147\n00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:37.340\nthey're gonna give you an ultimate goal to\naccomplish, or parameters to stay within.\n\n148\n00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.590\nSo what's gonna, you go out and\ntry to accomplish that.\n\n149\n00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.720\nWell, what happens if along the way,\nyou happen to bump into something that\n\n150\n00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.430\nwhile you're identifying it, you haven't\ngot a full identification on it yet\n\n151\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.890\nto confirm it but it's a critical system.\n\n152\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.460\nLet's just say all other\nthings considered,\n\n153\n00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.130\nlet's just say that it\nis a domain controller.\n\n154\n00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.920\nDo you really think that company wants you\nto kick a big hole in the side of their\n\n155\n00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.300\ndomain controller because you\nknow what's gonna happen?\n\n156\n00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.270\n>> Probably not.\n\n157\n00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.710\n>> So\nthat's probably not a desirable outcome.\n\n158\n00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.740\nIt might be, they might be fine with you,\n\n159\n00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.210\nbecause they should have multiple\ndomain controllers anyway.\n\n160\n00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.900\nSo if you take out one that might actually\n\n161\n00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.910\nput them under a little bit of duress and\nthey want to simulate that.\n\n162\n00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.070\n>> Could have been a PC emulator\nthough and then now I'm in trouble.\n\n163\n00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:23.996\nRight?\n>> Yeah, it could be.\n\n164\n00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:27.440\n>> Some of those domain controllers hole\nhave those single master operation roles.\n\n165\n00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.570\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n166\n00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.750\nThat could be something that\ncould cause a lot of mayhem, so\n\n167\n00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.170\nmaybe they want to see that.\n\n168\n00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:38.141\nOn the other hand, maybe they just don't\nwant you monkeying with their domain\n\n169\n00:09:38.141 --> 00:09:43.508\ncontrollers or maybe it's like they've got\na database of customer stuff on there.\n\n170\n00:09:43.508 --> 00:09:47.121\nOr maybe you're doing it for\nsomeone that's in finance or healthcare or\n\n171\n00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:48.196\nanything like that.\n\n172\n00:09:48.196 --> 00:09:50.792\nAnd they have systems out\nthere to contain that data and\n\n173\n00:09:50.792 --> 00:09:53.650\nthey just really don't\nwant you going into them.\n\n174\n00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.790\nAnd so what they'll do is they'll give\nyou, if they're gonna do a gray box,\n\n175\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:02.550\nthey give you the names of certain systems\nand say, these ones are off limits.\n\n176\n00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.510\nIf you find these things, tell us and\nwe'll tell you how to proceed.\n\n177\n00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.920\nThey might even say something like,\nif you can find any,\n\n178\n00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.950\nif you can find these systems,\ntest is over, you're done.\n\n179\n00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:20.340\nJust tell us how you got that far,\ngenerating the port and\n\n180\n00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:27.180\nif we want to have a meeting over this,\nor maybe have you help us fix this.\n\n181\n00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.200\nThat's where we're progressing because\nthey're saying by the time you found\n\n182\n00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.180\nthose systems, you've messed us up so\nbad they'd be able to get that\n\n183\n00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.950\nfar that we have to go and\naddress a lot of issues.\n\n184\n00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.310\nWe don't need you going that far.\n\n185\n00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.604\n>> So they're saying uncle at this point?\n\n186\n00:10:43.604 --> 00:10:44.650\n[LAUGH].\n\n187\n00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.500\n>> Yeah, yeah, they're tapping out.\n\n188\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.417\n[LAUGH].\n\n189\n00:10:48.417 --> 00:10:50.251\n>> Jinx, Domico.\n\n190\n00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:53.059\nAnother thing, I might be wrong in this,\nbut one of the ways that\n\n191\n00:10:53.059 --> 00:10:57.130\nI've always looked at, too, is the black\nbox test, there's no prior knowledge.\n\n192\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:01.870\nYou might miss a system that maybe\nyou didn't see that SQL Server,\n\n193\n00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.350\nthey had it relatively well secured or\nsomething so you never saw it.\n\n194\n00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.600\nSo you never really did a thorough\ntest on some of the vulnerabilities\n\n195\n00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.470\nthat SQL might have.\n\n196\n00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.750\nAnd if so they give you some\nknowledge they can ensure that\n\n197\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.750\nthe test is a little more thorough.\n\n198\n00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.090\n>> Yeah, that definitely,\nit could be that,\n\n199\n00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:22.610\nand that's a situation you can actually\nask yourself some questions there.\n\n200\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:27.020\nMainly as the client, but\nalso on the pen-testing side,\n\n201\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:33.090\nif you weren't able to find the SQL\nServer, is it a situation like you said.\n\n202\n00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:37.310\nThat they've secured it in such a way\nthat you aren't able to find it,\n\n203\n00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.340\nthat's a win for them.\n\n204\n00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.880\nBecause you didn't test the SQL Server,\nbut\n\n205\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.430\nthe reason why you couldn't test it is\nyou couldn't find it in the first place.\n\n206\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:50.135\nSo as long as you're skill are all up to\npar, you should have been able to find it.\n\n207\n00:11:50.135 --> 00:11:53.660\nAnd you've got the ability\nto find the thing, but for\n\n208\n00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.830\nsome reason they were able to counter\nit and stop you from finding it,\n\n209\n00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.140\nthen again that's something that\ngoes in the win column for them.\n\n210\n00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.960\nIf it's something that they wanted\nyou to specifically do a test on,\n\n211\n00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.050\nthen they should be specking out that\nthat's something that they want you\n\n212\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:08.990\nto do a test on so.\n\n213\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:14.040\nIt should be written up in there that\nokay, we need you to test this system and\n\n214\n00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.770\nthey'll give you the information\nyou need to test it,\n\n215\n00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.210\nif they want to see if\nit's vulnerable to that.\n\n216\n00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.440\nSo you gotta ask yourself,\nyou're absolutely right a black\n\n217\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.670\nbox would be a situation where\nyou may miss a system, but\n\n218\n00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.590\nif that's the goal to see if you\ncan't find it, you can't hack it,\n\n219\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:36.540\nthat's a win of some degree for them,\nthen they should be happy about that.\n\n220\n00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.510\nBut yeah, there are the other things too.\n\n221\n00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.340\nIf they really wanted to test it,\nheck, let's do a black box first.\n\n222\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.010\nYou didn't find it?\n\n223\n00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:43.580\nGreat.\n\n224\n00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.480\nOkay.\n\n225\n00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.330\nYou did everything you could,\ncouldn't find it.\n\n226\n00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.580\nIt was very difficult to find\nbefore you trip off an alarm.\n\n227\n00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.580\nOkay, well, we've accomplished that.\n\n228\n00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.770\nThen you can move on to the next phase\nof testing which is where let's go after\n\n229\n00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.330\nthat system now we know it's there.\n\n230\n00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.430\nThey're going to say okay, good.\n\n231\n00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.610\nNow that you've done this,\nwe've got those results.\n\n232\n00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:03.780\nLet's talk about phase two, which is let's\nhave you test specific applications.\n\n233\n00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.940\n>> You might actually use\nmore than one model of this,\n\n234\n00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.730\nthen during your penetration test.\n\n235\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.160\n>> Yeah, they could write it out, say we\nwanna get the initial hack to see what\n\n236\n00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.140\nthat person would see when they come in,\nhow far they could get, and then,\n\n237\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.990\nafter we've got that, okay good,\nwe can address those issues.\n\n238\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.570\nBut while they're addressing those issues,\n\n239\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.940\nlet's have you look at some specific\napplications, see what you can find.\n\n240\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.280\nSo yeah, they can switch to a black box\nfrom one, and then once they've done that,\n\n241\n00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.290\nthey can lift the veil and say,\nokay, this is a white box test.\n\n242\n00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.530\nWe're going to be performing\nit on SQL Server.\n\n243\n00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.130\n>> Roberto in the chat room\nhad a good question, but\n\n244\n00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.680\nI think he answered his\nown question there.\n\n245\n00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.890\nHe says give us some of the exploits\nfound in medical devices recently,\n\n246\n00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.030\nwhat does Sean think about testing these.\n\n247\n00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.590\nWith any response as well, in a hospital\ntaking down a device could take lives.\n\n248\n00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.615\nSo what are your thoughts there?\n\n249\n00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:47.290\nProbably a pretty good answer-\n>> When do I start?\n\n250\n00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:52.035\n>> [LAUGH] I don't care,\nI'll test whatever.\n\n251\n00:13:52.035 --> 00:13:54.966\n[LAUGH] But always human life\nhas to come first, right?\n\n252\n00:13:54.966 --> 00:13:58.531\nThat's paramount in any network,\nin any environment so\n\n253\n00:13:58.531 --> 00:14:01.511\nwe wouldn't do anything\nthat would risk that.\n\n254\n00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:05.700\n>> Yeah, when you get to medical\nenvironment, all kidding aside, of course.\n\n255\n00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.190\nWhen you get to a medical environment,\nthere's absolutely is that potential.\n\n256\n00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:15.815\nHowever, you could still test it, and\nwith the knowledge of that environment,\n\n257\n00:14:15.815 --> 00:14:20.447\nheck, I'd say in that type of\nenvironment if you're worried that\n\n258\n00:14:20.447 --> 00:14:24.583\nthe situation that they have\ncould result in taking lives,\n\n259\n00:14:24.583 --> 00:14:28.079\nI mean there's an outside possibility for\nthat.\n\n260\n00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:33.157\nIf that is the case, then what we\nhave now have to look at is when I'm\n\n261\n00:14:33.157 --> 00:14:38.689\ndoing this test, I need to have\nsomeone inside that's knowledgeable,\n\n262\n00:14:38.689 --> 00:14:41.241\nthat knows this test is going on.\n\n263\n00:14:41.241 --> 00:14:44.918\nThat if I see something that is\nquestionable or what have you,\n\n264\n00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:49.371\nI can contact that person and see if\nthat's something or I need to proceed or\n\n265\n00:14:49.371 --> 00:14:50.856\nthey're saying hey no,\n\n266\n00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:55.660\nthat's not an area we need to proceed,\nat least not right now or not at all.\n\n267\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.814\nThat would be something that\nwould be a special case.\n\n268\n00:14:57.814 --> 00:14:59.242\nLet's not do that.\n\n269\n00:14:59.242 --> 00:15:03.252\nThe other thing you've gotta remember\nwhen you go into medical environments\n\n270\n00:15:03.252 --> 00:15:06.283\nwhich may not be something\nthat's on everyone's radar.\n\n271\n00:15:06.283 --> 00:15:10.315\nI'm assuming if Roberto's asking this,\n\n272\n00:15:10.315 --> 00:15:16.890\nhe's got some knowledge or\nis working in a medical environment.\n\n273\n00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.220\nIf you're working in\nsomething like a hospital,\n\n274\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.630\na clinic, doctor's office, you're doing\na penetration test against those things or\n\n275\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.780\nheck, this is even a general IT issue.\n\n276\n00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.646\nJust in case you're unaware of it.\n\n277\n00:15:28.646 --> 00:15:33.053\nSome of these systems, just the very\nfact that you've touched them and\n\n278\n00:15:33.053 --> 00:15:36.958\ngotten into the OS or done anything,\nyou've broken the seal.\n\n279\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.410\nNow that system can't be used.\n\n280\n00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.940\nTo heck with, at that point, whether or\n\n281\n00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:46.520\nnot someone, the live taking issue, we'll\nassume that that's out of the picture.\n\n282\n00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.470\nYou've gone in and done something,\ninteracted with the system that was\n\n283\n00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.660\ncertified by the FDA to\nmeet certain standards.\n\n284\n00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.690\nAnd you've tampered with it and\ndone stuff.\n\n285\n00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.361\nThat system no longer holds certification.\n\n286\n00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:00.993\nIt has to be recertified.\n\n287\n00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:04.456\nSo now they have to call somebody out from\nthe appropriate agency that's gonna have\n\n288\n00:16:04.456 --> 00:16:05.552\nto check the whole thing.\n\n289\n00:16:05.552 --> 00:16:10.184\nDo a whole certification credation\nprocess to put it back in\n\n290\n00:16:10.184 --> 00:16:15.460\nservice I have absolutely seen and\nheard of that happening.\n\n291\n00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:21.760\nIn fact, the one place I had heard\nof it was with a version of SNS.\n\n292\n00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.080\nI know someone that had\nworked at a hospital,\n\n293\n00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.270\nplugged their SNS system in there,\nset it up.\n\n294\n00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.310\nThe way SMS works.\n\n295\n00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:34.230\nIt goes out and looks at all the subnets\nit's attached to and starts.\n\n296\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.450\nOr we go into configuration managers now\nthat looks at all those things and starts\n\n297\n00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:43.180\ntrying to push agents and stuff like that\nunless you give it specific instructions.\n\n298\n00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:50.050\nIn their case, they actually lost\ncertification on like four, five devices.\n\n299\n00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.826\nAnd these were devices that were being\n\n300\n00:16:54.826 --> 00:16:59.350\ndown is an impact on that hospital.\n\n301\n00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.750\nOne of them was like an x-ray\nmachine they took out because it had\n\n302\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.500\nstuff attached that had to be accredited.\n\n303\n00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.740\nSMS went in there tried to push an agent\non it several times and when it wasn't\n\n304\n00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.340\nsuccessful it pushed an agent on it\nenough, pushed enough of it on it, did\n\n305\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.710\nenough tampering that now that system's-\nthe seals basically been broken on it and\n\n306\n00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.790\nnow they need to call the appropriate\npeople in to re-certify\n\n307\n00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.380\nthe whole device to make sure\nit meets what it's supposed to.\n\n308\n00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.110\n>> So, if you're doing a test on\nany type of healthcare facility or\n\n309\n00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.702\nsomething like that,\nthere's probably a lot of stuff included.\n\n310\n00:17:27.702 --> 00:17:28.210\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n311\n00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.830\n>> In that original agreement\nthat's saying, look,\n\n312\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.780\nthese systems are off limits, or\n\n313\n00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.290\nthere's a special environment we'll test\nit in out of production, or something.\n\n314\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.810\n>> Yeah, and if you don't know all\nthe specifics of that environment,\n\n315\n00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.770\nyou better be damn well be careful.\n\n316\n00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:49.990\nSomething like a medical facility would\nbe something that, you mess around and\n\n317\n00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.860\neven now they have to re-certify devices.\n\n318\n00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.880\nThat's something that I hope\nyou have good insurance for,\n\n319\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.310\ncuz you may very well need it.\n\n320\n00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:03.320\nI'd really kinda stress that\nin that type of a situation\n\n321\n00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.240\nit's going to have some on the inside,\nyou should always have that.\n\n322\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.640\nOne other thing to mention on that\nis the taking lives part of it,\n\n323\n00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.780\nthat one is obviously definitely\nnot a good thing to have happen.\n\n324\n00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.520\nIt should never be that easy to do it\n\n325\n00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.990\njust by busting systems that you\ncould have the ability to take lives.\n\n326\n00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:32.020\nThe one I think is interesting about\nthat is from a pen tester's side\n\n327\n00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:36.230\nyou're going to get into hot water if that\nhappens, but you'll also have a situation\n\n328\n00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:39.730\nwith hospitals, like why did you let\nthem in there doing that sort of thing?\n\n329\n00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.160\nWhy weren't precautions taken?\n\n330\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.540\nBut I'd also mention,\nif you're on the bad guy side,\n\n331\n00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.470\nyou really are a black hat and\nyou're poking around a hospital like that\n\n332\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.120\nbecause you're just going\nto want to do whatever.\n\n333\n00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.530\n>> Whatever your goal is you decide\nthat that's what you're going to do.\n\n334\n00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.560\nYou poke around that environment like\nthat and you cost someone a life,\n\n335\n00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.410\nit's one of the few situations\nin the hacking world where,\n\n336\n00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:06.310\nif you- any action you take\nresults in someone's death,\n\n337\n00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.540\nyou are automatically eligible for\nthe death penalty.\n\n338\n00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.470\nYou will- you may very well get it.\n\n339\n00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.450\n>> So we're really careful with that.\n\n340\n00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:18.300\n[LAUGH] Now, Shaun, when it comes to\nperforming a pen test how do we know when\n\n341\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:23.220\nwe should do a pen test if\nwe should do a pen test?\n\n342\n00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:27.700\n>> We have a bunch of things that could\ntell us that we are good candidates for\n\n343\n00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.580\na pen test.\n\n344\n00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:33.090\nIn general, I'd say if you're a company\nyou should consider doing a pen test just\n\n345\n00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:38.220\nbecause it's a very good\nthing to do because it really\n\n346\n00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.690\nputs the stress on and puts the spurs\nto really seeing if security works.\n\n347\n00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:48.750\nWhen you get to an enterprise environment\nthat just even grows even more from that\n\n348\n00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:55.760\nbecause you've got a situation in those\nlarge enterprise environments where\n\n349\n00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:01.290\nthey've got so many moving parts, and\nall that, that you yourself may require\n\n350\n00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.850\nthe skill of additional members\nof your team to even do this.\n\n351\n00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.810\nI've had to do that where\nI've had myself plus six or\n\n352\n00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:15.680\nseven members of a team that were working\non doing various things because no\n\n353\n00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:21.720\none of us had the manpower resources to do\nit on our own no matter how good we were.\n\n354\n00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.520\nSo that was kind of that, but\n\n355\n00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.170\nas far as when it's necessary,\nRoberto mentioned about medical.\n\n356\n00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.840\nMedical is going to require\nit with HIPAA guidelines and\n\n357\n00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.730\nsome of the other guidelines that come\nin do dictate that that has to be done.\n\n358\n00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:41.115\nFinancial has to do it and there's plenty\nof other ones that need to do this,\n\n359\n00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:42.495\njust for common sense.\n\n360\n00:20:42.495 --> 00:20:48.655\nI'd even say for most of the places that\ndeal with client information, let's say\n\n361\n00:20:48.655 --> 00:20:55.395\nsomething like Target that's processing\nlots of payment cards and stuff like that.\n\n362\n00:20:55.395 --> 00:20:58.375\nThere's also the payment\ncard industry that requires\n\n363\n00:20:58.375 --> 00:21:01.540\ncertain types of pen tests to\nbe done on a regular basis.\n\n364\n00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.190\nAnd even on top of that, and this is also\nsomething else that comes into play.\n\n365\n00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.420\nIf you're gonna ask to do a pen test,\nbecause now we're not looking at\n\n366\n00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.560\nperforming the pen test, we're talking\nabout contract someone to do the pen test.\n\n367\n00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.810\nThat's what a cas would be doing.\n\n368\n00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.490\nYou need to ask need to ask yourself,\nif you're somebody like that Target, and\n\n369\n00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.940\nyou're processing credit cards, for\n\n370\n00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.310\nexample, you can't call me in, no matter\nhow much you want me to do that or\n\n371\n00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:30.480\nhow suited you think I am to it, you\ncan't call me in to do it because I'm not\n\n372\n00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.600\ncertified to do it in\nthe actual payment card\n\n373\n00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.750\nregistry because they'll look at you and\nsay yeah you've got the skills.\n\n374\n00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.890\nThey could look at me and\nsay yeah you've got the skills and\n\n375\n00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.640\nthe experience and all that.\n\n376\n00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.010\nBut you have to register\nwith us specifically and\n\n377\n00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:52.820\nshow us that you have such and such track\nrecord, that you got this, this, and this,\n\n378\n00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.890\nthat you have certain levels of insurance\nand other stuff from a business side\n\n379\n00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:02.860\nto show us that hey, you are ready to\ntake this on and that you're suitable for\n\n380\n00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.580\nit to work in this environment.\n\n381\n00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.460\n>> Is that because during the course of\nyour pen test, you could very well expose\n\n382\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:13.470\nor gain access to confidential,\npersonal identical, liable information?\n\n383\n00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.750\nCredit card information, things like that.\n\n384\n00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.460\nAnd they wanna make sure that\nyou aren't taking that info and\n\n385\n00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.180\nselling it in the background.\n\n386\n00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.550\n>> Yeah, there's definitely that.\n\n387\n00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.310\nThere's also a consistency issue.\n\n388\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.850\nThey want to make sure that you're not\njust grabbing a pen tester out of anywhere\n\n389\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.450\nand putting them in there.\n\n390\n00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:32.760\nThey want to make sure that you're using\nan approved pool of people that they have.\n\n391\n00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.880\n>> Cause I can turn around and say, \"Oh,\nwe did our pen test every year.\" but\n\n392\n00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.060\nit was my buddy Joe that did the pen test.\n\n393\n00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.680\n>> Yeah,\nthat would definitely be one of them.\n\n394\n00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.840\nAnother one would be,\nif you're doing these pen tests,\n\n395\n00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.910\nthey want to make sure that you know heck,\ntheir butts on the line too, the payment\n\n396\n00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.770\ncard industry because they have to\ntake care of all of these devices and\n\n397\n00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:55.184\nregistering these devices and\ncertify stuff and retailers and all that.\n\n398\n00:22:55.184 --> 00:22:58.565\nThey want to make sure that\ntheir name on the line, and\n\n399\n00:22:58.565 --> 00:23:00.895\nall the stuff they're liable for\nand the stuff you're liable for,\n\n400\n00:23:00.895 --> 00:23:06.185\nthey wanna make sure that the person\nyou're bring in has the insurance and\n\n401\n00:23:06.185 --> 00:23:11.982\nbonding and all that behind them that\nif something happens, that they've\n\n402\n00:23:11.982 --> 00:23:17.152\ngot the stuff to [LAUGH] whatever\nthey call it, the safety net.\n\n403\n00:23:17.152 --> 00:23:17.927\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n404\n00:23:17.927 --> 00:23:21.862\n[LAUGH] All right, then what are our, I\nknow we've gone over this a couple times,\n\n405\n00:23:21.862 --> 00:23:25.250\nbut real quick,\nrefresh us the steps on a pen test.\n\n406\n00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:30.750\n>> Steps on a pen test,\ndepending on which model you talk about,\n\n407\n00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.000\nwe have different steps.\n\n408\n00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.840\nI mean, the one from,that EC-Council uses,\nthat quite a few people know,\n\n409\n00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:42.470\nit's where you have your reconnaissance,\nand then you do your your scanning and\n\n410\n00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.290\nenumeration then you need exploitation,\n\n411\n00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:49.210\nand maintaining access, and\nthen clearing your tracks.\n\n412\n00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.280\nSo you've got a whole process there.\n\n413\n00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.210\nThey're not the only game in town.\n\n414\n00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.060\nThere's plenty of other models\nout there that can be used.\n\n415\n00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:02.283\nYou can develop your own but then you also\n\n416\n00:24:02.283 --> 00:24:07.361\nhave a pen testing guidelines online.\n\n417\n00:24:07.361 --> 00:24:12.768\nThere's actually,\nI believe it's a non profit, that actually\n\n418\n00:24:12.768 --> 00:24:18.865\nposted The standardized pen testing\noutline that gives you templates and\n\n419\n00:24:18.865 --> 00:24:23.896\ntells you what steps you should be taking,\nhow to document.\n\n420\n00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:28.236\nAnd so they give you a really,\nI don't want to say pretty good, a really,\n\n421\n00:24:28.236 --> 00:24:31.210\nreally good layout of\nhow things will proceed.\n\n422\n00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:35.160\nYou've got to like that because\nit makes your life a lot easier.\n\n423\n00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.350\nThe bottom line is here is we want\nto make sure we have these steps,\n\n424\n00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.780\nwe're performing a pen test rather,\nthat we have steps that we're\n\n425\n00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.690\nfollowing to make sure that\nthere's consistency being done.\n\n426\n00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.300\nThat the right things are being tested.\n\n427\n00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.930\nIt's not just something that you came in,\nscratch your head and say,\n\n428\n00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.279\nokay let's just start over there.\n\n429\n00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:57.430\nNo you've got, there's a method to your\nmadness as you progress through this.\n\n430\n00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:59.380\n>> And Roberto's got another question.\n\n431\n00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.170\nI know we've talked about this before, but\nlet's do it one more time in this section.\n\n432\n00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:06.070\nOutside contractor versus\nin house contractor.\n\n433\n00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:12.876\n>> You're probably not going to\nlike the answer totally on that.\n\n434\n00:25:12.876 --> 00:25:15.093\n>> I know where he's going with this.\n\n435\n00:25:15.093 --> 00:25:17.834\n>> Both are perfectly acceptable.\n\n436\n00:25:17.834 --> 00:25:22.984\nWhat's going to qualify one is I'm not\ngoing to tell you just off of that,\n\n437\n00:25:22.984 --> 00:25:27.570\nthat outside contractor is better\nthan in-house or vice versa.\n\n438\n00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.386\n>> There are kinda pros and\ncons to both, right?\n\n439\n00:25:29.386 --> 00:25:33.360\n>> Yeah, that doesn't give me enough.\n\n440\n00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.110\nSo instead of just\nleaving it like that and\n\n441\n00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.490\nsaying okay, I can't give you something,\nboth are good,\n\n442\n00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:43.550\nyou've got to think about what it is\nyou're trying to accomplish as the test.\n\n443\n00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:48.170\nIf you're a CASP or you're that\nmanager bringing in a pen tester,\n\n444\n00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.016\ndecide that that a pen test\nneeds to be performed.\n\n445\n00:25:50.016 --> 00:25:56.640\nRemember an in-house tech\nknows your systems, and\n\n446\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.760\nwhen you look at that in-house tech knows\nyour systems, so a test will go quicker.\n\n447\n00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.395\nThey know what to expect,\nthey know what should be there,\n\n448\n00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:07.520\nthey know who to contact if they\nneed anything, and that's all great.\n\n449\n00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.542\nBut if you're trying to simulate what\na black hat would do if they paint\n\n450\n00:26:11.542 --> 00:26:14.198\na bulls-eye on you and\ndecide to go after you,\n\n451\n00:26:14.198 --> 00:26:16.610\nan in-house tech isn't going to cut it.\n\n452\n00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:19.460\n>> A black hat, or a black box is\nout of the question at that point.\n\n453\n00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.430\n>> Yeah, they've got knowledge of stuff,\n\n454\n00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:25.280\nso that's not,\nthat kind of changes things.\n\n455\n00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.350\nIf on the other hand,if\nyou want to simulate\n\n456\n00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:32.340\nwhat an actual bad guy would be doing,\nan outside contractor's gonna be better.\n\n457\n00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:38.350\nIf you want to be, in Roberto's case here,\nhe's working in a medical facility,\n\n458\n00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:42.070\nit seems like, if you have someone\ninternally that does this,\n\n459\n00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:46.670\nif Roberto was doing that for\nhis organization, hey great.\n\n460\n00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.290\nThe benefit is that now\nhe's got the knowledge,\n\n461\n00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.430\nthey can take advantage\nof his skills more often.\n\n462\n00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.330\nThey need to have things checked out.\n\n463\n00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:59.170\nThey also have his expertise there\nwhich is a great thing to have.\n\n464\n00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:03.560\nHe's a phone call away, or he's the next\noffice over, whatever, he works for\n\n465\n00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.180\nthe organization.\n\n466\n00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.460\nBut if you go the other route and\nyou bring me to audit and\n\n467\n00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.840\ndo a pen testing into this organization,\n\n468\n00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:17.280\nI have other than what they provide me\nas part of the contract for example.\n\n469\n00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.200\nI know the name of the company,\nunless they choose to give me an IP or\n\n470\n00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.940\nanything up above that,\nthen I've got zero knowledge.\n\n471\n00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.060\nI have to find a way to acquire\neverything, I have to fight for\n\n472\n00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.830\nthat, so\nthat's what a black hat would have to do.\n\n473\n00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.050\nThey'd have to do the recon, they'd have\nto do the scanning and find open doors,\n\n474\n00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.160\nand stuff like that to get in.\n\n475\n00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:41.320\nThat's something that a white hat is going\nto have a much easier time with, and\n\n476\n00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:41.960\ncan't do.\n\n477\n00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.920\nBut I can't do, on the other hand,\nwhat someone on the inside does\n\n478\n00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.980\ndirectly either, because they've got\nfull knowledge of everything, or\n\n479\n00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.740\nassumed to have some higher-level\nknowledge then I would.\n\n480\n00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:56.300\nThat's not to say that you couldn't\nhave someone on the inside decide to\n\n481\n00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.900\nget really pissed and have an ax to grind\ninside and they're going to take you out.\n\n482\n00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.560\nThat's something you could simulate but\n\n483\n00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.790\nthose are kind of getting\nto the what if scenarios.\n\n484\n00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.180\nBoth have weight, you have to set goals,\n\n485\n00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:13.350\nremember what each one can do,\nthe knowledge they possess and\n\n486\n00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.920\nthen figure out what type of test\nis going to get you the results.\n\n487\n00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.720\nPlenty of companies use both.\n\n488\n00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:24.280\nThey would use an in-house on a regular\nbasis and then there's annually or\n\n489\n00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.570\nmaybe every couple of years, they will say\nlet's get an outside contractor to do it,\n\n490\n00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:31.220\nto also verify this stuff,\nbecause we need to do that.\n\n491\n00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.640\n>> And then last thing I know we want to\ntalk about here, areas for assessment.\n\n492\n00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.910\nHow do we decide what is it\nthat we really need to test?\n\n493\n00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.820\nWe need to test everything, or\nwe just focus on things that we\n\n494\n00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.980\nknow have known vulnerabilities, like\nour web server, or our web applications.\n\n495\n00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.720\nHow do we decide that?\n\n496\n00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.640\n>> This is an important part\nof the process because you\n\n497\n00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.020\njust can't say test everything.\n\n498\n00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.670\nThat's a really bad statement to make,\nbecause it's just, well how do you feel?\n\n499\n00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.110\nBad.\nOkay, well, that really helps out.\n\n500\n00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:02.340\nIt doesn't really get you there.\n\n501\n00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.367\nWhat you want to do as a CASP,\neven before you call in a pen tester,\n\n502\n00:29:06.367 --> 00:29:08.786\nis start sitting down with your team and\n\n503\n00:29:08.786 --> 00:29:13.280\nfiguring out what you're trying to\naccomplish to spark a pen test.\n\n504\n00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.540\nIf it happens to be a legal requirement,\nyou already know that.\n\n505\n00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.210\nYou check it off your list,\nit's a legal requirement.\n\n506\n00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:23.010\nWhat does that specific requirement\nsay you need to provide?\n\n507\n00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.780\nWell you've got your road map.\n\n508\n00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.930\nYou start talking to a pen tester and\nsay, okay well,\n\n509\n00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.540\nwhat's your experience with this,\ncan you do this, this, and this?\n\n510\n00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.460\nAnything you think we\nshould add to this test?\n\n511\n00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.340\nYou can start talking and\nhave that consultative relationship, so\n\n512\n00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.640\nyou can determine what areas to assess.\n\n513\n00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.240\nBut then you also have when you're\nlooking at this sort of thing, and\n\n514\n00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.320\ndoing and figuring out what areas\nto assess, just in general.\n\n515\n00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.976\nIf you don't have legal guidelines,\nstart figuring out,\n\n516\n00:29:50.976 --> 00:29:54.896\noh, which assets are more\ncritical than others?\n\n517\n00:29:54.896 --> 00:29:59.306\nThat would be one big one because,\nwhat do you want to do?\n\n518\n00:29:59.306 --> 00:30:04.183\nDo you want to pay a pen tester to see\nif he can snatch a piece of paper off\n\n519\n00:30:04.183 --> 00:30:06.221\nthe receptionist's desk?\n\n520\n00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:07.533\nYou need to pay me for that.\n\n521\n00:30:07.533 --> 00:30:09.600\nI'll just grab it right now.\n\n522\n00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.563\nI'll be right back.\n\n523\n00:30:10.563 --> 00:30:11.390\nWhat do you want?\n\n524\n00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.310\nYou want me to get something from\nthe vending machine too while I'm out?\n\n525\n00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.980\nThat's easy.\n\n526\n00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:21.684\nBut you want to have a, when you\nlook at it, maybe you want to say,\n\n527\n00:30:21.684 --> 00:30:26.612\nokay I need to test this area,\nthis area, and this area.\n\n528\n00:30:26.612 --> 00:30:29.709\nOr maybe I need to,\nwhen I'm evaluating assets, you know,\n\n529\n00:30:29.709 --> 00:30:32.745\nI don't need to test what\nthe receptionist is, I want you to\n\n530\n00:30:32.745 --> 00:30:36.820\ntest to see if you can get into the server\nroom and plant a device in there.\n\n531\n00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:41.014\nMaybe I want to see if you can\nget a document from the outside,\n\n532\n00:30:41.014 --> 00:30:46.371\nget a document placed right on the boss's\ndesktop when they turn on Windows.\n\n533\n00:30:46.371 --> 00:30:47.400\nAre they going to see it?\n\n534\n00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.340\nCan you use their email account?\n\n535\n00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.790\nThose type of things.\n\n536\n00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:53.560\nSo you could determine\nthat on a technical side.\n\n537\n00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.230\nThen you have on the physical side,\nwhich would be another part.\n\n538\n00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.582\nThe physical side would be,\n\n539\n00:30:58.582 --> 00:31:03.777\nwell do I have a concern with\nphysical security in my location?\n\n540\n00:31:03.777 --> 00:31:07.572\nOr again, do I have a legal requirement,\nfor something like a bank or medical or\n\n541\n00:31:07.572 --> 00:31:09.950\nanything like that, then what happens?\n\n542\n00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.648\nThey've got requirements for that.\n\n543\n00:31:11.648 --> 00:31:15.975\nJust HIPAA alone, if I can go into your\n\n544\n00:31:15.975 --> 00:31:19.575\nplace as any sort of clinic,\nmedical facility, anything like that.\n\n545\n00:31:19.575 --> 00:31:21.745\nIf I can go in and\n\n546\n00:31:21.745 --> 00:31:26.415\ngrab any HIPAA controlled documents,\nor should be covered by HIPAA,\n\n547\n00:31:26.415 --> 00:31:31.060\nif I can grab a patient record and go over\nhere and say, yeah, about that pen test?\n\n548\n00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:31.930\nYou know, there you go.\n\n549\n00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:35.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I can do that, you lose.\n\n550\n00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.200\nAnd so I've tested physical\nsecurity at that point.\n\n551\n00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:43.666\nIf I can walk into a room and photocopy\na file or something, that's a big,\n\n552\n00:31:43.666 --> 00:31:48.001\nbig ding on you, and\nyou want to figure out how to fix that.\n\n553\n00:31:48.001 --> 00:31:52.199\nYou're going to look at the areas that\nare at risk, which ones are higher value,\n\n554\n00:31:52.199 --> 00:31:56.230\nwhich ones are areas of concern and\nwhich ones maybe don't need to be tested.\n\n555\n00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:00.990\nAnd then once you've got those,\nthen get a pen tester on it and\n\n556\n00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:04.210\nthen see if a pen tester even\nhas anything to add to it.\n\n557\n00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:08.873\nI'd even, in some cases, add into this\nwhole mix, sometimes I call in pen\n\n558\n00:32:08.873 --> 00:32:13.105\ntesters because other people in\nthe industry have become victims.\n\n559\n00:32:13.105 --> 00:32:15.225\nAnd in the board of directors, or CEO or\n\n560\n00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:19.659\nwhatever is worried that if they're going\nto be a victim so they're kind of like,\n\n561\n00:32:19.659 --> 00:32:23.855\nyeah could you come in and check to\nsee if we have that problem, and okay.\n\n562\n00:32:23.855 --> 00:32:25.115\n>> Saw what happened to them last week.\n\n563\n00:32:25.115 --> 00:32:26.885\nWe want to make sure that same\nthing doesn't happen to us.\n\n564\n00:32:26.885 --> 00:32:27.744\n>> Yeah.\n\n565\n00:32:27.744 --> 00:32:29.408\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, yeah,\n\n566\n00:32:29.408 --> 00:32:33.470\nwe don't want to have any job\nopenings on the board any time soon.\n\n567\n00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:34.886\nSo that could be outside, so\n\n568\n00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:38.367\nyou really have got to take a good look\nat the areas that are at risk, and\n\n569\n00:32:38.367 --> 00:32:42.143\nwhat you have to protect and figure out\nwhere you're going to go from there.\n\n570\n00:32:42.143 --> 00:32:46.396\nAnd keep in mind, you may have to really\nlook for those results as a pen test, or\n\n571\n00:32:46.396 --> 00:32:50.779\na pen tester, for example, may not have\nany knowledge of physical security, so\n\n572\n00:32:50.779 --> 00:32:53.701\nyou may have to get someone\nthat specializes in that.\n\n573\n00:32:53.701 --> 00:32:58.401\nBecause I could get a pen tester,\nI know of a place that I've\n\n574\n00:32:58.401 --> 00:33:02.913\nseen several times back home that,\nthe way they have it,\n\n575\n00:33:02.913 --> 00:33:09.410\ntheir technology is very secure but they\nhave a nice black fence around the stuff.\n\n576\n00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:14.520\nWhich is nice, a big black iron fence,\ntall and dealing with all that.\n\n577\n00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.040\nProblem is,\nis that they've got a big, nice,\n\n578\n00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:25.599\nlong shrub planted all inside that\nfence that is very thick and tall.\n\n579\n00:33:25.599 --> 00:33:28.210\n>> I could cut on that fence all day and\nnobody would see what I was doing.\n\n580\n00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:29.690\n>> Yeah, in fact, I can get over that.\n\n581\n00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.810\nIf I can get right over that fence,\njust hop right over it,\n\n582\n00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.030\nI can then go up to the facility itself,\nwhich also has a lot of stuff, trees and\n\n583\n00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.416\nstuff like that planted around it,\ngame over.\n\n584\n00:33:40.416 --> 00:33:43.960\n>> That's it, all right,\nwell Sean another great episode here.\n\n585\n00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.715\nLooking at the clock,\nwe're about out of time for\n\n586\n00:33:45.715 --> 00:33:49.820\nthis one, so anything else we want to\nthrow in about penetration testing?\n\n587\n00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.065\n>> No, I think we're pretty good on that.\n\n588\n00:33:52.065 --> 00:33:54.945\nExcept to tell them maybe,\nif you want more information on it,\n\n589\n00:33:54.945 --> 00:33:59.380\nwe've got the CEH course sitting\nout there, that's what that covers.\n\n590\n00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.940\n>> All right well ladies and gentleman,\nthat's going to wrap this one up.\n\n591\n00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.380\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n592\n00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.360\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n593\n00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.608\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n594\n00:34:06.608 --> 00:34:07.260\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.130\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nwith me today is Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.120\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.470\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.620\n>> I'm doing great, excited, we've got\nanother one of our CompTIA advanced\n\n8\n00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.500\nsecurity practitioner\nepisodes coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.810\nAnd in this one we're gonna take a look\nat risk management, a big part of\n\n10\n00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.128\nwhat we have to do at the CASP level, when\nwe get up into that enterprise level, and\n\n11\n00:00:33.128 --> 00:00:37.000\nspecially if we're designing things, risk\nmanagement is a big part of that right?\n\n12\n00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.930\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n13\n00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.150\nIt's once you've got to this point,\nyou as a CASP,\n\n14\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.440\nyou are definitely getting to the point\nwhere it's no longer just what type of\n\n15\n00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.180\ncontrols can you put in place and\nwhat type of threats are facing you.\n\n16\n00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.560\nIt's a matter of, now that you know the\ntools or at least have some familiarity\n\n17\n00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.140\nwith them, now what you're doing\nis you're figuring out which ones\n\n18\n00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.830\nare the best because up to this point it's\njust a matter well, there's this, this.\n\n19\n00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.550\nAnd this and you don't really have an idea\nof what combination of tools you can\n\n20\n00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.040\nuse, and\nwhich one is gonna be most effective and\n\n21\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.605\njust all the things\nthat revolve around it.\n\n22\n00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:19.490\nCuz the reality is when you do\na risk assessment and you're going\n\n23\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.670\nthrough all this, you're trying to figure\nout okay, now I know the tools, I know\n\n24\n00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.770\nthe possibilities there, what combination\nis gonna work best for my situation,\n\n25\n00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.360\nas well as ultimately, how many dollars\nand time and all that you have too.\n\n26\n00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.400\n>> Absolutely, that's one of the things,\nI'm not the best at risk management.\n\n27\n00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.090\nBut I know there's a lot of times, one\nyou've gotta identify all your risks, and\n\n28\n00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.790\nwe're gonna break all this down for you.\n\n29\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.873\nAnd you gotta identify those risks and\nthere's ways I can mitigate those risks,\n\n30\n00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:50.390\nbut sometimes those ways cost\nmore than what I would have to\n\n31\n00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.800\nface if that risk came to fruition or\nif somebody took advantage of that risk.\n\n32\n00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.890\nSo it's definitely a lot of analyzing,\n\n33\n00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.120\na lot of calculation and trying to figure\nout what the best way to handle it is.\n\n34\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.045\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n35\n00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:08.151\nWhen you do a good risk assessment and you\nreally figure out where the risk stands,\n\n36\n00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:11.350\nyou're gonna come up with a roadmap,\nwhen you really get down to it.\n\n37\n00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.900\nYou gotta cover the roadmap of\njust how things need to play out.\n\n38\n00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.360\nLike I said, up to this point,\nreally all you can do is,\n\n39\n00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.224\nthis doesn't mean everybody in here,\nbut we're just kind of assuming that if\n\n40\n00:02:24.224 --> 00:02:28.290\nyou're coming in to the CASP,\nyou're moving up the food chain.\n\n41\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.471\nYou went from implementing and following\nthe procedures and all that to now,\n\n42\n00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:36.267\nyou've gotta determine strategy and\nwhen you determine strategy and\n\n43\n00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:39.095\nyou're looking at budgets and\nall that good stuff,\n\n44\n00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:43.300\nyou really have to figure out what tools\nare gonna be the best ones for the job.\n\n45\n00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.550\nYou can only do that by doing a risk\nassessment, figuring out okay,\n\n46\n00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.750\nwhat are my threats.\n\n47\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.520\nWhat are my vulnerabilities?\n\n48\n00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.550\nAll those types of things and\nput them together and saying okay,\n\n49\n00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.080\nthese things will address that and\nthese are my goals,\n\n50\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.105\ndo all those things fit together?\n\n51\n00:02:57.105 --> 00:03:01.820\n>> So the first thing I guess we have to\ndo is identify the vulnerabilities that we\n\n52\n00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.240\nface, and\nthey can come from all different places.\n\n53\n00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.990\n>> Oh, yeah, I mean that's kind of, if you\ngo back in our episodes here and you look\n\n54\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.330\nat stuff like application development and\nyou look at your network architectures.\n\n55\n00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.160\nThen, you start factoring in people and\nphysical stuff and all those things that\n\n56\n00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.600\ngo along with that, what ultimately\nhappens is, is that you will see a lot of\n\n57\n00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.830\nvulnerabilities emerge right off the bat,\nand then there's other\n\n58\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.060\nones you have to go just start digging\ndown and take the time to find them.\n\n59\n00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.670\nBecause they're pesky, there's always\nanother one that you can find.\n\n60\n00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.890\nThe question is, how much time\nare you gonna spend doing that and\n\n61\n00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.050\nwhat can you do to actually address it.\n\n62\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.430\nAnd remember, just to make sure\nwe're all on the same page.\n\n63\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.110\nJust because you have a vulnerability\ndoesn't mean that you need to think\n\n64\n00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.430\nthe sky is falling and\nyou need to do something about it.\n\n65\n00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.790\nBecause there's a vulnerability,\nwhat you need to do is, okay,\n\n66\n00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.310\nI know the vulnerability is there,\nso I've got that addressed.\n\n67\n00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.360\nNow the next step is,\n\n68\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.270\nonce I know the vulnerability is there,\nare there any threats against it?\n\n69\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.330\nAnd if their is a threat against it, then\nnow I've got something to worry about.\n\n70\n00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.759\nAnd you're gonna try and identify both,\nit's gonna be easier for you to find\n\n71\n00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:19.620\nthe vulnerabilities cuz we have, really\nhave plenty of ways for you to do that.\n\n72\n00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.440\nYou've got the automated scanners,\nyou've got pen testers,\n\n73\n00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.090\nwhich we talked about\npen testing previously.\n\n74\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.780\nAnd you have other things you can go to,\nto find those vulnerabilities.\n\n75\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.570\nBut once you have the vulnerabilities\nyou need to find okay,\n\n76\n00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.370\nwhat type of threats are out there, are\nthose credible threats and then you kind\n\n77\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.550\nof got to weigh your options between the\ntwo and figure out what the actual risk of\n\n78\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.090\nexposure, meaning, how likely is it\nthat that's gonna be taken advantage of.\n\n79\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.310\nAnd once you've determined that,\nas well as, what a single exposure might\n\n80\n00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.320\ncost you at the end of the day,\nthen you can move on to further steps.\n\n81\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.520\n>> Yeah, cuz that's really gonna\ndetermine how much we have to spend\n\n82\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.470\non mitigating that risk, right,\nis how much is it gonna cost me?\n\n83\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.720\nIf it's only gonna occur\nonce a year on average, and\n\n84\n00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.540\nthat incident is only gonna cost me $1000,\nso that's $1000 a year.\n\n85\n00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.380\nBut I'm not gonna spend $50,000 a year\nto protect myself against that risk,\n\n86\n00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.995\nwhen it's only gonna cost me\na 1,000 if it even happens.\n\n87\n00:05:20.995 --> 00:05:25.740\n>> Yeah, that's really a great\nexample of it is that,\n\n88\n00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.970\nif you look at the chance of it happening\nas quite high, but the exposure\n\n89\n00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.862\nis only gonna be, like you said,\nwe'll use your number, about a $1,000.\n\n90\n00:05:34.862 --> 00:05:40.070\nSpending $50,000 to address\nthat on a yearly basis or\n\n91\n00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.600\nmaintenance cost and all that and\nit comes out more than a 1,000 well,\n\n92\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.115\nthat's just really just\na misuse of resources.\n\n93\n00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:53.185\nNow if it's something like,\nit's $1,000 a year, that you lose,\n\n94\n00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:58.145\nlet's say let's make it something that's\nreally trite, you know we'll say office\n\n95\n00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:02.465\nsupplies, people are walking off with it,\nif it costs you 10 to 20 bucks to get\n\n96\n00:06:02.465 --> 00:06:07.525\na lock to put on there then that clearly\nis something that's cost effective.\n\n97\n00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:10.380\nSo you gotta kind of weigh those things.\n\n98\n00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.330\nDon't be stupid with this, this is one\nof the things that risk management does\n\n99\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.780\nis prevent you from doing something stupid\nlike that, where you spend more money on\n\n100\n00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.440\nthe prevention part than whatever happened\nif the thing actually took place.\n\n101\n00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.310\nThere have been plenty of cases\nwhere people have done that and\n\n102\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.960\nyou may go into a place,\nsome of you have probably been\n\n103\n00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.740\ninto a place where you've seen that's\nlike, why did someone do that?\n\n104\n00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.940\nIt was actually,\nwould have been as a thief or a hack or\n\n105\n00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.160\nsomeone going in that wants to steal\nsomething, it would have been cheaper for\n\n106\n00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.875\nme to steal the actual counter\nmeasure than anything behind it,\n\n107\n00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:48.610\ncuz I can sell that for a lot more than\nanything I would have got from that.\n\n108\n00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.090\nSo it's kind of just\nan interesting way to look at it.\n\n109\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.580\n>> Absolutely, and I know Don Pezet\nuses an example of meteor insurance.\n\n110\n00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.620\nI mean yeah, we are at risk of\ngetting struck by a meteor, and\n\n111\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.130\nthe damage would be catastrophic.\n\n112\n00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.060\nBut the likelihood, so\nit's not just the amount of damage that\n\n113\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.660\nthe incident would incur, but it's also\nthat likelihood that it's gonna occur.\n\n114\n00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.885\nWe don't have meteor insurance here.\n\n115\n00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:18.125\n[LAUGH] We decided against that.\n\n116\n00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:19.910\n>> [LAUGH] You know,\nyou can bet on that, actually.\n\n117\n00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.782\nYou can bet on that and\nyou can bet on alien invasions too.\n\n118\n00:07:23.782 --> 00:07:25.430\n>> You can bet on anything\nyou want in Vegas, right.\n\n119\n00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.160\n>> [LAUGH] You can buy insurance for\nit too and\n\n120\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.640\nalien invasion just in case you want.\n\n121\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.250\n>> Really?\n\n122\n00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.660\nYeah there's a place that sells that.\n\n123\n00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.610\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'll have to look into that.\n\n124\n00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.500\nAll right so we got, you know when\nwe talk about risk we talk about\n\n125\n00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.440\nidentifying the vulnerabilities,\nthen you've got the operational risks.\n\n126\n00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.190\nAnd what do we mean by that?\n\n127\n00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.350\n>> Operational risks,\nwhen you get to kind of like the mid level\n\n128\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.970\nwhere the CASP is positioned, you know\nthere's many different levels of risk.\n\n129\n00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.913\nThere's the operational, and then we can\nsay there's the long term, strategic,\n\n130\n00:07:52.913 --> 00:07:53.416\nand all that.\n\n131\n00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:57.461\nWhen you get to the operational stuff,\nthat's the day to day stuff,\n\n132\n00:07:57.461 --> 00:08:02.296\nthat's just when you're going about the\ncourse of business over the short term.\n\n133\n00:08:02.296 --> 00:08:03.829\nThings happen.\n\n134\n00:08:03.829 --> 00:08:11.020\nLet's say you get stuff like tailgating,\npeople following someone in the building.\n\n135\n00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.790\nYou get people walking away from their\nsystems and leaving stuff logged in.\n\n136\n00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.155\nOr Bringing in flash drives,\nstuff like that.\n\n137\n00:08:18.155 --> 00:08:21.927\nThose would all be thrown in\nthe realm of operational risks.\n\n138\n00:08:21.927 --> 00:08:24.145\nThose are things that happen\non a day-to-day, or very,\n\n139\n00:08:24.145 --> 00:08:25.235\nvery short term basis.\n\n140\n00:08:25.235 --> 00:08:27.365\nIt's not something that\nyou're planning for\n\n141\n00:08:27.365 --> 00:08:30.165\nnecessarily over a long period of time.\n\n142\n00:08:30.165 --> 00:08:35.555\nI might plan my technology over a midterm\nor long term period of time to do\n\n143\n00:08:35.555 --> 00:08:41.240\nsomething to implement something to stop\nthe spread of things like flash drives.\n\n144\n00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.820\nI might do something to install\nthings like man traps to prevent\n\n145\n00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.790\ntailgating into the building.\n\n146\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.004\nBut, that falls out of the realm, or\n\n147\n00:08:52.004 --> 00:08:56.480\nthat's just another aspect\nof dealing with risk.\n\n148\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.160\nYou still have a day to day\nrisk of what you do right now\n\n149\n00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.890\nto stop people from doing these things or\ncausing certain things to happen.\n\n150\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.690\nSo, operational would be kind of like,\nit would be very,\n\n151\n00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.960\nvery short or near-term issue.\n\n152\n00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.660\nYou're just going about business and\nthese things happen.\n\n153\n00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:22.020\nAnd if you're gonna talk about,\nfor example,\n\n154\n00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.960\nin terms of what the CISSP uses,\nif I can borrow something from that.\n\n155\n00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.840\nYou have the short-term, which is\noperational, then you have strategic and\n\n156\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.720\ntactical, which are midterm and\nlong term, respectively.\n\n157\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.190\nSo, you have different things.\n\n158\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.410\nThe tactical, strategic, those\nare typically pushed down the road or\n\n159\n00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.380\nup the food chain more towards where\nsomebody like an upper management or\n\n160\n00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.950\nsomebody that's gonna be going\nto the CISSP would be doing.\n\n161\n00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:55.380\nSince you're just kind of bumped\nout of the front line support and\n\n162\n00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.240\ndealing with actually making security\nhappen and now you're at that\n\n163\n00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.010\nfirst level or second level, or whatever\nmanagement and dealing with security.\n\n164\n00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.630\nNow you're doing operational.\n\n165\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.780\n>> So as a CASP,\nthat's the one we're really focused on.\n\n166\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.460\n>> Yeah, that's where you can expect\nto see yourself, is in that area,\n\n167\n00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.480\nlike a department manager.\n\n168\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.990\nYou could be in that type of role\nwhere you are dealing with that,\n\n169\n00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.970\nwhere a department director or CSO or\n\n170\n00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.850\nsomebody like that would be dealing with\nthe tactical and strategic, respectively.\n\n171\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.630\n>> Gotcha.\n\n172\n00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.210\nAnd then when you talk about\nrisk in business models.\n\n173\n00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.794\nWe're not talking about a bad haircut,\nor something like that.\n\n174\n00:10:30.794 --> 00:10:32.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> About the same models there.\n\n175\n00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.190\n>> That could be a risk to personal\nsecurity if you're the person clipping it.\n\n176\n00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:45.560\nWhat I would say with your business model\nis to make this more understandable.\n\n177\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.460\nCuz I can sit here and\ntalk about different business models and\n\n178\n00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.370\ntalk about what they are.\n\n179\n00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:57.400\nThink of it in terms of how you operate or\nhow you do whatever it is you do.\n\n180\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.090\nEvery business and how you work and\n\n181\n00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.920\nhow you do things,\na certain risk is gonna come into play.\n\n182\n00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.250\n>> And\nsome of it's gonna be higher than others.\n\n183\n00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:11.510\nFor example if your business model\nrevolves around being a dairy or\n\n184\n00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:16.185\na bakery or something like that,\nyour risk probably isn't all that high.\n\n185\n00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:18.970\nThere's probably not a lot\nof big stuff in there.\n\n186\n00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.270\nThere might be, you could make a case\nof well, there's health concerns and\n\n187\n00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.810\nstuff like that, which technically,\nfrom a security standpoint,\n\n188\n00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.620\nis something that, it's a regulation\nthat we have to maintain.\n\n189\n00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.600\nYou're probably never gonna get into\nthat type of stuff, but who knows?\n\n190\n00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.250\nNow, when you go to financial, healthcare,\n\n191\n00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:40.680\ndefense situations where you're dealing\nwith personally identifiable information,\n\n192\n00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.480\nthose are different business models and\ndifferent businesses totally that\n\n193\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.550\nhave even additional levels of risks\non top that need to be addressed.\n\n194\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:51.140\nIf you're in any situation where\nif you exclude the healthcare,\n\n195\n00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.760\nthen the finance stuff and\nall those things,\n\n196\n00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.230\nyou've got PII, personal identifiable\ninformation, on the line.\n\n197\n00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.810\nThere's a whole new level of risk there\nbecause losing control of that is\n\n198\n00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:08.406\nsomething that is going to call people's\nconfidence in you into question,\n\n199\n00:12:08.406 --> 00:12:13.270\nbecause you were entrusted to keep\nthis safe and secure and you didn't.\n\n200\n00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:19.110\nCertain business models are definitely\ngonna be more prone to having higher\n\n201\n00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.560\nrisks, as well as having higher measures\nof controls that need to go with them.\n\n202\n00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.620\nBecause there are gonna be more\npotential vulnerabilities, and\n\n203\n00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.540\nthere's gonna be many\nmore threats against it.\n\n204\n00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.600\nLike I said,\nif you happen to work in a bakery,\n\n205\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.020\nthere's probably not too\nmany threats against you.\n\n206\n00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.910\nI don't know, I don't know how\ncompetitive the bakery industry is.\n\n207\n00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.860\nBetty Crocker and Sara Lee could\nbe really vicious, I don't know.\n\n208\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.140\nSo, who knows how that works.\n\n209\n00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:52.070\nWhen you get into finance and defense and\n\n210\n00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:57.690\npower generation, stuff like that,\nnow there is a much more\n\n211\n00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:03.380\njuicier target for someone that wants to\ncause mayhem and wants to cause mischief.\n\n212\n00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.400\nThose would be very,\n\n213\n00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.640\nvery good targets as opposed to\nthe former targets in this case.\n\n214\n00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.970\n>> Yeah, I could see where the cost.\n\n215\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:15.300\nYou know, if I'm running a forum and\nI'm storing people's e-mail addresses or\n\n216\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.250\nsomething like that, you know,\n\n217\n00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:21.130\nthere's a risk of that getting out,\nbut I'm not storing the cost if that\n\n218\n00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:26.280\ndid get out is gonna be far less than if\nI was storing health care information.\n\n219\n00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.960\nAnd HIPAA regulations were in place,\nand I let that information get out,\n\n220\n00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.850\nthat's gonna cost me, as you said,\nin many ways, not only monetarily.\n\n221\n00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.470\nThere's gonna be fines associated.\n\n222\n00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:40.030\nI could get in trouble legally and so\na lot greater risk then, because of\n\n223\n00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.210\nthe type of data that I'm storing or the\ntype of business model that I'm running.\n\n224\n00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.700\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\n225\n00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.950\nNow, when we look to the risks,\nwe said they can come from all over.\n\n226\n00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:53.430\nThat means they can be from the outside or\nthey can be from the inside, right?\n\n227\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.861\n>> Yes, there's the outside,\nthere's inside,\n\n228\n00:13:56.861 --> 00:13:59.630\nthen there's also when you look at it.\n\n229\n00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.990\nIn fact, let's just, before I get too far,\nI get all excited, I guess, in here.\n\n230\n00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.085\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, it's Monday,\n\n231\n00:14:06.085 --> 00:14:08.212\nI will not be this excited tomorrow.\n\n232\n00:14:08.212 --> 00:14:10.355\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm kidding.\n\n233\n00:14:10.355 --> 00:14:15.173\nSo, when you look at the external versus\ninternal, first of all, if we look at\n\n234\n00:14:15.173 --> 00:14:20.000\nthe internal side, and obviously\nstuff inside, your business itself.\n\n235\n00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.416\nAnd there's almost like a countless\nnumber of things that can come there.\n\n236\n00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:32.740\nBut, the big ones tend to be stuff that is\nreally kind of the man made type stuff.\n\n237\n00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.200\nYou don't have too many natural\ndisasters happen internally,\n\n238\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.886\nyou know, unless somebody's\nreally got a bad stroke of luck.\n\n239\n00:14:38.886 --> 00:14:39.869\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, so.\n\n240\n00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:44.570\n>> A super collider could end up\ncreating a black hole right here\n\n241\n00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.165\nin our studio [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you never know!\n\n242\n00:14:47.165 --> 00:14:50.080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But typically,\n\n243\n00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.520\nwhen you have stuff inside, it's almost\nabsolutely gonna be a man made issue.\n\n244\n00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.150\nIt's gonna be an insider threat\nwould be a very, very good example.\n\n245\n00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.030\nAnd it's incredibly dangerous,\n\n246\n00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:08.000\nbecause you've got someone that's had a\nlot trust and all that imparted upon them.\n\n247\n00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.900\nAnd they know how you do business and they\nunderstand things back there to a degree\n\n248\n00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.970\nand they could cause you some mayhem.\n\n249\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.680\nBut then you could go out\nto other types of things.\n\n250\n00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.310\nIn addition to insider threats you\ncould have stuff that's accidental.\n\n251\n00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.290\nSomeone does something without thinking.\n\n252\n00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.030\nThat happens a whole heck of a lot.\n\n253\n00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:33.010\nYou get all sorts of malicious things\nin addition to insider threats.\n\n254\n00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.578\nSomeone is just is ticked off,\ndecides to do something.\n\n255\n00:15:36.578 --> 00:15:37.490\nThey don't wanna get fired,\n\n256\n00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:42.010\nbut they do something kind of on\nthe down low to cause problems there.\n\n257\n00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.148\n>> The AC system brakes and\ndrips water all over my server closet.\n\n258\n00:15:45.148 --> 00:15:47.484\n>> Yeah, it could happen.\n\n259\n00:15:47.484 --> 00:15:50.940\nYeah, suddenly screws out of the AC or\nsomething pulls them out.\n\n260\n00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.916\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You never know.\n\n261\n00:15:51.916 --> 00:15:58.497\nSo, those things, there could be numerous\nthings that happen on the inside.\n\n262\n00:15:58.497 --> 00:16:01.528\nNow, when you move to the outside\nthat opens it up even more.\n\n263\n00:16:01.528 --> 00:16:05.886\nBecause yes you do have The man\nmade issues that do kind of\n\n264\n00:16:05.886 --> 00:16:10.170\ninvolve some of the stuff\nthat we just mentioned.\n\n265\n00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.220\nYou could have someone\nthat's an insider or\n\n266\n00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:17.140\nwas a former insider that\ncould now be on the outside,\n\n267\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.460\nand now they're still ticked off at you,\nand they could cause something.\n\n268\n00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.050\nAnd that's happened numerous times.\n\n269\n00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:28.260\nThere's been situations\nwhere you have things like\n\n270\n00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.820\nprotests, you have civil unrest, and\nthe list goes on and on, and on and on.\n\n271\n00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.500\nIt all depends on where\nyou are on some of those.\n\n272\n00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.100\nThen you get, when you look at the\noutside, you also get those natural ones\n\n273\n00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.910\ncoming into play too,\nthat you really can't do anything about.\n\n274\n00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:46.520\nThey are neither malicious or benevolent,\nthey're just something that happens.\n\n275\n00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.341\nThose are your earthquakes, your fires,\nyour floods, you keep going on and\n\n276\n00:16:51.341 --> 00:16:53.730\non, and on and on, and on about that.\n\n277\n00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.509\nSo you really can have a lot\nof different things happen.\n\n278\n00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:02.091\nSo those are threats that when\nyou're doing a risk assessment,\n\n279\n00:17:02.091 --> 00:17:04.159\nyou definitely have to keep in mind.\n\n280\n00:17:04.159 --> 00:17:08.373\nI'd also say that when you're doing this,\nwhen you're considering the different\n\n281\n00:17:08.373 --> 00:17:12.110\ntypes of external influences and\nrisk factors that come into play.\n\n282\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:17.580\nThey're not always something that's just\ngonna be a constant, they can change.\n\n283\n00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.090\nWhen you look at stuff on\nthe natural side, what do we get?\n\n284\n00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:25.910\nIf you're in California you get, well,\nwe get all the stuff I mentioned.\n\n285\n00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.725\n[LAUGH] In California,\nif you look at earthquakes,\n\n286\n00:17:28.725 --> 00:17:31.140\nearthquakes do not have a season.\n\n287\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.215\nYou know, there's just gonna happen.\n\n288\n00:17:33.215 --> 00:17:37.020\n[LAUGH] Just whenever they feel like,\nthey will happen.\n\n289\n00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.130\nOther stuff is gonna be seasonal.\n\n290\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.666\nI'd say rain seasonal but we don't get\nthat in California either, apparently.\n\n291\n00:17:43.666 --> 00:17:48.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They keep saying but.\n\n292\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.962\nYeah, but you can have certain\nthings that are seasonal,\n\n293\n00:17:51.962 --> 00:17:56.210\nthat they're not there all the time\nfrom the natural standpoint.\n\n294\n00:17:56.210 --> 00:18:01.550\nBut then, those are still somewhat\neasier to kind of predict, I'd say.\n\n295\n00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.280\nBut if you look at the man-made side,\n\n296\n00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.940\nit's not necessarily always gonna be\nthat way with that, man made stuff\n\n297\n00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.780\nhas the benefit, or disadvantage or\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n298\n00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.060\nJust being completely\nunpredictable in a lot of cases.\n\n299\n00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:21.500\nSomeone could do something outside\nthe building that impacts you.\n\n300\n00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.950\nLike people backing into power poles and\nknocking out stuff for a building.\n\n301\n00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:31.102\nOr who hasn't run into\nthe situation in IT?\n\n302\n00:18:31.102 --> 00:18:34.272\nI think a lot of people in IT run into the\none where someone was operating nearby,\n\n303\n00:18:34.272 --> 00:18:35.943\na backhoe, or doing some construction.\n\n304\n00:18:35.943 --> 00:18:38.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And tore up cables.\n\n305\n00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:44.950\nIt definitely happens, so\na lot of potential risks there.\n\n306\n00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.910\n>> And then the ones with,\n\n307\n00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:50.420\nlet's say we take those natural ones that\nare external like hurricanes and fires.\n\n308\n00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.970\nWe might not be able to predict\nwhen they're gonna occur, but\n\n309\n00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.860\nwe can mitigate them still.\n\n310\n00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.500\nWe can still focus on things that we\ncan do to protect ourselves from them\n\n311\n00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.750\nif they do occur?\n\n312\n00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.530\n>> Yeah, you can do certain things.\n\n313\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.628\nAnd I'd say at least with the benefit\nof something like a hurricane,\n\n314\n00:19:07.628 --> 00:19:10.313\nif you could say there's\nany benefit there,\n\n315\n00:19:10.313 --> 00:19:14.850\nat least you can kind of get it down to\na certain block of time during the year.\n\n316\n00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:20.678\nBut still, even with that being said,\nyou can still take certain actions\n\n317\n00:19:20.678 --> 00:19:26.530\nto maybe shore stuff up a bit better\nto make sure you're better prepared.\n\n318\n00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:31.270\nHopefully you've learned from past\nsituations and past hurricanes and\n\n319\n00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:36.840\npast stuff to see, okay,\nwhat can we do to improve communication,\n\n320\n00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.310\nto make our response time better,\nto get people out of harm's way?\n\n321\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.840\nYou can do those things.\n\n322\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:47.740\nI mean, sometimes the focus here\nwould be a lot of times to be,\n\n323\n00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.260\nwell, if there's a problem where you\nneed to figure out a way to fix,\n\n324\n00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.580\nget our facilities working,\nkeep stuff online.\n\n325\n00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.240\nIt's not always going to be that way.\n\n326\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.460\nWhen you're moving up\nto the CASP situation,\n\n327\n00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.020\nyou got to realize that you don't always,\n\n328\n00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.030\nyou aren't always in a situation where you\ncan just put some extra stuff in place.\n\n329\n00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.050\nAll of a sudden,\nyou've magically solved the problem.\n\n330\n00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.800\nIt may just be a case of well,\n\n331\n00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.390\nyou see something the size of\na Katrina bearing down on you.\n\n332\n00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.250\nDrivers, start your engines,\nwe gotta get out of here.\n\n333\n00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.631\n>> [LAUGH] Duck and cover.\n\n334\n00:20:21.631 --> 00:20:23.291\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n335\n00:20:23.291 --> 00:20:25.335\n>> All right, so one of the things,\n\n336\n00:20:25.335 --> 00:20:26.941\nwhen we talk about risk and\n\n337\n00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:30.518\nwe've talked about how we wanna\ntake a look at that again,\n\n338\n00:20:30.518 --> 00:20:35.370\nwe are going to break the risk analysis\nprocess down in a little bit later.\n\n339\n00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.027\nSome of the things that we really gotta\nworry about like our data, right?\n\n340\n00:20:38.027 --> 00:20:42.741\nWith our data, all of these risks put our\n\n341\n00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:47.048\ndata at risk in some form or fashion.\n\n342\n00:20:47.048 --> 00:20:48.348\n>> I understood what you said.\n\n343\n00:20:48.348 --> 00:20:48.848\n>> Thank you.\n\n344\n00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:51.533\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] If you guys don't,\n\n345\n00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:54.095\npress rewind, it'll sink in.\n\n346\n00:20:54.095 --> 00:20:55.488\n>> I think I got it right.\n\n347\n00:20:55.488 --> 00:20:59.749\n[LAUGH]\n>> But yeah.\n\n348\n00:20:59.749 --> 00:21:04.013\nSo our data obviously is a big thing that\ngot to protect and each one of these risks\n\n349\n00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:08.370\nmight impose something different\nthat we have to face with our data.\n\n350\n00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:13.430\n>> Yes, there,\ndata is one of those valuable things.\n\n351\n00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.530\nYou can't just easily recreate it.\n\n352\n00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.660\nI could buy hardware, I can buy software.\n\n353\n00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.710\nIf I don't have personnel available\nI can get other personnel that's\n\n354\n00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:28.090\nprobably trained, but data, you really\ncan't recreate it all that easily.\n\n355\n00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.880\nIt's something that's unique.\n\n356\n00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.650\nSo you wanna preserve it,\nmake sure it's safe.\n\n357\n00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:36.490\nSo you can do all those backups and\nall those things to keep it safe,\n\n358\n00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:40.440\nwhich you should be doing without us\neven have to tell you about that.\n\n359\n00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.500\nBut you need to also figure out\nhow often are you gonna do that?\n\n360\n00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.660\nWhere it's gonna be stored?\n\n361\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.744\nAs well as how easy access can\nget to it after disasters happen.\n\n362\n00:21:48.744 --> 00:21:52.638\nSo you can think about those risks,\nwhatever they are, you could have\n\n363\n00:21:52.638 --> 00:21:58.385\nthe natural ones, you have the man-made\nones where someone's caused some mischief.\n\n364\n00:21:58.385 --> 00:22:02.870\nAnd how, what are you going to do to\nsafe guard that as well as you know,\n\n365\n00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.470\nwhat could you do if some of\nthe bad stuff does happen.\n\n366\n00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.450\nHow can you get back as\nquickly as possible to\n\n367\n00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.080\nwhere you were before whatever\nhappened eh, happened?\n\n368\n00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.380\nRemember it doesn't have to be that you're\ndata all of a sudden becomes inaccessible\n\n369\n00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.210\nor is gone,\nthose are kind of extreme cases.\n\n370\n00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.500\nIf it's gotten that far,\nit's become completely inaccessible or\n\n371\n00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:28.680\nit's all completely just gone poof, and\nit's gone, that's getting pretty extreme.\n\n372\n00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:34.319\nIt could just be something as simple,\nand I kind of hate saying that,\n\n373\n00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:38.902\nbut it could be something such\nas data has been altered.\n\n374\n00:22:38.902 --> 00:22:43.230\nIt's still there, but\nyou know there's been alteration in it.\n\n375\n00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:46.410\nAnd now you gotta play this\ngame of what's been altered and\n\n376\n00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.230\nthen how did they alter it.\n\n377\n00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.130\nAnd that brings up even a bigger issue is,\n\n378\n00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.100\nokay, well I know something\nwas altering this database.\n\n379\n00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.240\nWhat was altered?\n\n380\n00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.860\nOkay, well I found the record\nthat was altered so\n\n381\n00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.990\nI'm gonna bring it back off a backup.\n\n382\n00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.850\nBut that's not the end of the story.\n\n383\n00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.670\nWhat's to prevent them\nfrom doing that again?\n\n384\n00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.830\nWhat else did they alter?\n\n385\n00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:11.190\nSomething else I'm missing, that's gonna\nbe a big investigative process for you.\n\n386\n00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.560\nSomething that we're gonna\ntalk about that too.\n\n387\n00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.300\n>> All right, and then I know you\nmentioned we've talked about ex-filtration\n\n388\n00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.910\nof data in a previous episode but\nthat's another risk that we have to face.\n\n389\n00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.009\n>> Yeah, it's a very real risk nowadays.\n\n390\n00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.381\nI don't have any numbers or any ideas or\n\n391\n00:23:28.381 --> 00:23:32.784\nstatistics on how often data\nexfiltration happened in the past.\n\n392\n00:23:32.784 --> 00:23:37.791\nIt's always been there that there's\nsomeone that carries information out for\n\n393\n00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:41.525\nwhatever reason,\nthey carry it out to sell it to somebody,\n\n394\n00:23:41.525 --> 00:23:45.202\nthey carry it out to,\njust because to see if they can do it.\n\n395\n00:23:45.202 --> 00:23:49.206\nHeck, I've heard of people carrying,\nI remember hearing one case where someone\n\n396\n00:23:49.206 --> 00:23:52.108\ncarried out a set of blueprints for\nwhat was the F-117,\n\n397\n00:23:52.108 --> 00:23:55.608\nwhen that was still under development,\nthey carried out blueprints.\n\n398\n00:23:55.608 --> 00:23:58.869\nAnd to show to their\ngirlfriend to impress her.\n\n399\n00:23:58.869 --> 00:24:02.628\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's been around.\n\n400\n00:24:02.628 --> 00:24:03.569\n>> You've gotta do what you've gotta do.\n\n401\n00:24:03.569 --> 00:24:07.450\n>> Yeah, I guess, you know.\n\n402\n00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:12.340\nSomeone did that and in that case,\nit can be really for any reason.\n\n403\n00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.410\nIt's been around for awhile,\nbefore we had all the digital stuff.\n\n404\n00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:16.509\nI mean, that blueprint stuff.\n\n405\n00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:21.940\nThe Nighthawk was developed in the 70s so\n\n406\n00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:27.540\nyou're talking before we had all\nthe really widespread use of computers.\n\n407\n00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.270\nSo it's always been an issue, but\n\n408\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:37.040\nnowadays it's become a lot easier with\nflash drives and cloud services and\n\n409\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.510\ngadgets to help you\ntransport data more easily.\n\n410\n00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.260\nIt's become more of an issue,\nand I even say,\n\n411\n00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.740\nnot only are we monitoring it more, so\nwe're seeing that it's more of a problem,\n\n412\n00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:53.070\nwe're also seeing these things where\npeople can carry it out easier.\n\n413\n00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:57.990\nBut on top of that I wanna say the\nculture's almost changed where everyone\n\n414\n00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.150\nwants to be the next whistleblower or\nshow that they've got something.\n\n415\n00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:06.760\nSo they want to do that,\nthey want to become the next big thing.\n\n416\n00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.050\nSo it seems like oh well hey,\nI'm gonna pull this and this and this.\n\n417\n00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:13.410\nI've seen people make up all\nthese weird theories like oh,\n\n418\n00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:18.050\nlook I'm gonna be\nthe whistleblower on this.\n\n419\n00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.540\nIt's like you have nothing really.\n\n420\n00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.130\nBut it seems like that\ntends to be more common.\n\n421\n00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:27.640\nAnd I don't know if that's accelerated\nsince you had the Wikileaks issue\n\n422\n00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.010\nand other stuff.\n\n423\n00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:30.470\nBut it seems like that's even helped it.\n\n424\n00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.640\nStuff that, other things,\n\n425\n00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.360\nyou need to think about that\npeople are actively doing this.\n\n426\n00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.545\nSad as it is,\npeople are actively doing this stuff now.\n\n427\n00:25:38.545 --> 00:25:39.370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n428\n00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:43.280\nYeah, there's a lot of different risk that\nour data faces coming from all directions.\n\n429\n00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:48.570\nYou got data corruption,\ndata deletion, stealing of the data.\n\n430\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:49.980\nThere's no end to it.\n\n431\n00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.660\nAs a business definitely important\npart of my risk analysis.\n\n432\n00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.300\n>> Yeah, you can not overlook it.\n\n433\n00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.430\nData is one of the key things that\nmakes that business that business.\n\n434\n00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:04.050\nWithout it, that business,\nwith some exceptions,\n\n435\n00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.640\nis like anybody else in\ntheir marketing segment.\n\n436\n00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.820\nIf you look at banks.\n\n437\n00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.870\nThey all offer their own little perks and\nstuff like that.\n\n438\n00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:19.790\nBut the basic operation of a bank is\nstill the same amongst all of them.\n\n439\n00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.240\nIt has to be.\n\n440\n00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.580\nSo you have that commonality.\n\n441\n00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.850\nSo other than few perks and stuff like\nthat here, what really makes the bank\n\n442\n00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:33.340\nunique and able to really have\nits standing is its customers.\n\n443\n00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.825\nPeople are dumping money and\nkeeping it there because the bank is doing\n\n444\n00:26:36.825 --> 00:26:40.485\ninvestments and all this other stuff\nwith it, and they can boast that they\n\n445\n00:26:40.485 --> 00:26:44.232\nhave these large customers and this\nmuch in assets to attract more people.\n\n446\n00:26:44.232 --> 00:26:47.854\nTake that uniqueness away,\nwhat do you have?\n\n447\n00:26:47.854 --> 00:26:49.282\nYou don't have that.\n\n448\n00:26:49.282 --> 00:26:53.982\nSame thing with companies who have product\nportfolios, if your someone like Microsoft\n\n449\n00:26:53.982 --> 00:26:57.928\nand I take away all your data on your\nwhole product portfolio what are you?\n\n450\n00:26:57.928 --> 00:27:00.525\nYou're just a big software company.\n\n451\n00:27:00.525 --> 00:27:06.935\nSo that's something that that data\nis very much a big deal that you\n\n452\n00:27:06.935 --> 00:27:12.645\nhave to keep that safe, if you don't,\nthere's going to be a big problem.\n\n453\n00:27:12.645 --> 00:27:15.995\n>> All right well Sean a lot\nof great information there on\n\n454\n00:27:15.995 --> 00:27:19.900\ngetting our feet wet into risk management.\n\n455\n00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.000\nAnything else we want to toss in here,\nbefore we call this one a wrap.\n\n456\n00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.630\n>> I think we're doing\npretty good on that.\n\n457\n00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:26.820\n>> All right, I give up.\n\n458\n00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.700\nHope you guys enjoy watching this one.\n\n459\n00:27:28.700 -->

00:00:14.760\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.053\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:17.440\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.040\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n7\n00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.730\nHow you doing?\n>> I'm doing great,\n\n8\n00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.230\nbecause we're here doing our CompTIA\nAdvanced Security Practitioners Series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.750\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\ncontinue on with risk management.\n\n10\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.560\nNow we're gonna break down physically\nthe risk assessment process,\n\n11\n00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.050\ncuz there definitely is a procedure or\n\n12\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.430\nprocess that we need to follow\nwhen we're doing risk analysis.\n\n13\n00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.610\n>> Yeah, it's not something that\nyou just kind of throw stuff at and\n\n14\n00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.380\nsee what sticks.\n\n15\n00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.419\nAt this level, you're starting\nto break it down into individual\n\n16\n00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.830\nsteps in overall process to make\nsure stuff is getting done and\n\n17\n00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.140\nstuff is getting addressed the way\nit's supposed to rather than just hey,\n\n18\n00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.240\nthrow some stuff here and\nthere and hope it works.\n\n19\n00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.910\nWe have the steps we have to follow.\n\n20\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.580\nAnd heck, we maybe mandated that we have\nto follow that either by the higher ups or\n\n21\n00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.940\nby legal regulations or both.\n\n22\n00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.860\nAnd there could be other stuff\nin there that's driving this.\n\n23\n00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.730\nSo we have to make sure that this is\nbeing done and being done consistently,\n\n24\n00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.620\nreliably and even verifiably we\ncan do that each and every time.\n\n25\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.455\n>> There we go.\n\n26\n00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:24.720\nLike governmental regulation when it comes\nto like power and water treatment and\n\n27\n00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.450\nthings like that.\n\n28\n00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.620\nThere's industry regulations when it\ncomes to banking and stuff like that.\n\n29\n00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.753\nAnd then, of course, there's my own\ncompany might have its own regulations and\n\n30\n00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:35.070\nsay, hey we've gotta do this\nevery quarter or every year.\n\n31\n00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.940\nSo, could come from many different angles.\n\n32\n00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.640\nBut there is a basic process, right?\n\n33\n00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.900\nAnd that first step, Sean, is identifying\nthe risks that, or the assets, I'm sorry.\n\n34\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.920\nWe gotta figure out what\nit is we need to protect.\n\n35\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.770\n>> Yeah, that's the foundation.\n\n36\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.090\nIf you don't know what you're protecting,\nthen you need to stop,\n\n37\n00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.020\nyou need to figure out what you're doing,\nand go back to the drawing board, and say,\n\n38\n00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.750\nwhat is it I'm trying\nto build a wall around?\n\n39\n00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.940\nThat's just not gonna help.\n\n40\n00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.478\n>> If you don't know what\nyou're trying to protect,\n\n41\n00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:03.598\nit's very difficult to protect it.\n\n42\n00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:07.140\n>> Yeah, you just can't have that.\n\n43\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.570\nSo you gotta know where or\nwhat you are trying to protect.\n\n44\n00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.580\nAnd what you're trying to protect it from,\nwould be even the next part of it.\n\n45\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.540\nWithout knowing what\nyou're trying to protect,\n\n46\n00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.960\nwhat are you going to position\nyour defenses around?\n\n47\n00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.570\nBe like building the Wall of China,\nand figure it out?\n\n48\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.202\nWell, it's not China i'm protecting,\nbuilding it around some other,\n\n49\n00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:28.970\nlike Germany?\n\n50\n00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.225\nWell, they had a wall, so\ndon't worry about that.\n\n51\n00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:33.851\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Figuring out you're building a wall\n\n52\n00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:38.118\nain't gonna make it work unless you\nknow what it is you're trying to protect\n\n53\n00:02:38.118 --> 00:02:40.530\nas well as what you're trying to keep out.\n\n54\n00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.570\n>> Yeah.\nSo asset identification then.\n\n55\n00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.380\nPhase 1 of our risk management.\n\n56\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.040\nAnd that's going to include things\nthat you probably will think of\n\n57\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.710\nas well as some things that\nwe might not think of right?\n\n58\n00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.850\n>> Yes and this is why asset\nidentification can take quite a while.\n\n59\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.190\nIn fact, if you really,\nreally get into the brass tacks and\n\n60\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.910\nfine details with this, there's just\ntremendous amount of ways to figure out\n\n61\n00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.750\nwhat type of asset you're trying to\nprotect and how valuable they are.\n\n62\n00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.850\nBecause it's not just a question of just\nthat we have our asset sitting here.\n\n63\n00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.440\nSome of those assets are gonna\njust by their very nature be more\n\n64\n00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.170\nimportant than others.\n\n65\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.980\nThey're not all created equal.\n\n66\n00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.910\nSo you need to figure that out by\ndoing things like what they call\n\n67\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.090\nquantitative and qualitative analysis.\n\n68\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.640\nWhich is where you use numeric values or\n\n69\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.190\ngrades on stuff,\nas well as opinions on the other side.\n\n70\n00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.710\nTo figure out from subject matter experts\nin both cases, to figure out how valuable\n\n71\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.910\neach asset is and what would happen if you\nlost said asset in the scheme of things.\n\n72\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.470\nSo that's a very, very important thing to\nget and that's a very important thing to\n\n73\n00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.480\nspend some good serious time on,\nfigure out all those things.\n\n74\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.630\nAnd you are not going to do this on your\nown, that's kind of what you're getting to\n\n75\n00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.200\nhere, is that,\nmaybe things you don't expect.\n\n76\n00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.390\nYou're not going to know it all.\n\n77\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.740\nI don't care how good\nyou are as a CASP and\n\n78\n00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.140\nhow ready you are to go up\nthe food chain even further.\n\n79\n00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.430\nYou're not going to know it all.\n\n80\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.241\nYou need to solicit the help of\npeople in other departments or\n\n81\n00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:21.470\nmore close to the action in a lot of these\ncases, to see what types of things are out\n\n82\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.630\nthere so you can make sure you're\nadequately covering everything.\n\n83\n00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.410\nAnd obviously it's your technology,\nit's your facilities,\n\n84\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.430\nit's preserving your business processes.\n\n85\n00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.930\nThat would be an asset.\n\n86\n00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.240\nAnd then it's even people.\n\n87\n00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.650\nPeople are thrown into that mix and people\nare one of the things that are right\n\n88\n00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.240\non the top of the list of things\nthat you need to protect.\n\n89\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.108\nI mean there's really, as much as\nsome people might not like to think,\n\n90\n00:04:46.108 --> 00:04:49.144\nthere's nothing above people\nin the scheme of things.\n\n91\n00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:55.500\nYou look at it, when you're talking\nabout people and assets to protect.\n\n92\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.800\nJust think about if\na disaster were to happen,\n\n93\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.090\na fire started burning in the building,\nwhat are you gonna do?\n\n94\n00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.630\nAre you gonna your printer or\n\n95\n00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.770\nyour potted plant, or are you gonna start\ngetting people out of the building?\n\n96\n00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.600\nThat's a question that if you\ncan't answer it the right way,\n\n97\n00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.550\nyou really need to stop what you're doing\nand figure out, where's your medication.\n\n98\n00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.420\n[LAUGH] In all seriousness,\nyou need to figure out\n\n99\n00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.070\nif people aren't at the top of your list,\nwell then,\n\n100\n00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.090\nwhy aren't they at the top of your list,\nand how are you gonna put them there?\n\n101\n00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.770\n>> And then some of your people might be,\n\n102\n00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.320\nnot that any of your people are\nunimportant, but you've got key people.\n\n103\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.347\nMaybe you've got a software project\ndevelopment project that's going on.\n\n104\n00:05:36.347 --> 00:05:39.850\nAnd then you got one guy that's kind\nof masterminding the whole application.\n\n105\n00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.280\nYou lose that person because of health\nissues or he quits or something like that,\n\n106\n00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.670\nthat could throw that whole project into\nthe circular or the round can down there.\n\n107\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.970\nAnd that's something that you gotta\nthink about, that you might not have.\n\n108\n00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.290\nWhen you first think about risk analysis,\nwe think about things like fires and\n\n109\n00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.810\ntornadoes and hurricanes and floods and\nbad guys trying to steal our data.\n\n110\n00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.600\nDidn't think about if this person quits,\nthat could ruin everything.\n\n111\n00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.450\n>> You know you bring up a very\ngood point here with that.\n\n112\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:14.693\nIs when you get to a large\nenterprise level organizations.\n\n113\n00:06:14.693 --> 00:06:19.320\nAnd really any organization like you said,\neveryone's important.\n\n114\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.410\nThere's just different shades of\nit in terms of when you look at\n\n115\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.200\nkeeping the business going.\n\n116\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.770\nOne of the things I know\nwith enterprise companies.\n\n117\n00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.480\nI can tell you from working\nat several of them, or\n\n118\n00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.510\ninteracting with several of them I\nguess is a better way to put it.\n\n119\n00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.990\nThat, well heck,\nI can use the one I worked with years ago.\n\n120\n00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.740\nThe executive staff and\nthe board and all those things,\n\n121\n00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.440\nthey actually had a document that\nsaid who could travel with who.\n\n122\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.350\nThat was kinda the, one of the things\nwhere this led to was that they\n\n123\n00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.510\ndetermined who were key personnel\nthat need to be kept in place.\n\n124\n00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.270\nIf the company somehow, if there was\na disaster or something, they said they\n\n125\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.090\ndidn't want to shove all the key staff on\none plane and have that plane go down.\n\n126\n00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.280\nSo what they would do is say okay,\nthis person travel with this person but\n\n127\n00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.970\nthis person can't travel with this person.\n\n128\n00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.730\nIt was very clear.\n\n129\n00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.700\nThat certain combinations of\npeople could not travel together.\n\n130\n00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.080\nSome people could not travel with anybody\nelse because if that person was lost, it\n\n131\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:26.170\nwould need the other people to be able to\nfill that void if something had happened.\n\n132\n00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.200\nAnd so that came out of who's who and\nwho's got what in their head,\n\n133\n00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.450\nwho's got certain business processes\nstuff locked away in their gray matter.\n\n134\n00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.472\nAnd we don't want to lose more than one\nperson or certain combinations of people,\n\n135\n00:07:39.472 --> 00:07:42.146\ncuz that would be devastating,\nwe'll just avoid it.\n\n136\n00:07:42.146 --> 00:07:46.418\nOnce identified we'll put the chart out\nsaying when we're making reservations\n\n137\n00:07:46.418 --> 00:07:50.496\ndon't put these people in the same plane,\ndon't put them in the same hotel,\n\n138\n00:07:50.496 --> 00:07:51.560\njust in case.\n\n139\n00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.562\n>> Wow.\n\n140\n00:07:52.562 --> 00:07:54.850\nThat kind of leads right\ninto our next one,\n\n141\n00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:59.051\nwe go through our asset identification\nwhere we're defining all our things we\n\n142\n00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:02.570\nhave to protect that are important\nto our business information.\n\n143\n00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.470\nWe've said that data and information\nis a very important part of that.\n\n144\n00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:11.120\nBut kind of like we said with people,\nnot all data is equal as well, right?\n\n145\n00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.272\n>> Yeah, absolutely not.\n\n146\n00:08:12.272 --> 00:08:17.890\nThere's just an endless sea of information\nthat can stream out of any organization.\n\n147\n00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.370\nAnd in fact, I think a statistic, well,\n\n148\n00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.480\nit used to be that any company\nyou talked about the amount\n\n149\n00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.220\nof data that they had would double in\nsize about every 18 months, more or less.\n\n150\n00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.208\nThat's probably been\naccelerated a bit more.\n\n151\n00:08:31.208 --> 00:08:33.311\nAnd who knows,\nmaybe it's less in some cases,\n\n152\n00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:35.108\ndepending on how active the company is.\n\n153\n00:08:35.108 --> 00:08:39.876\nBut you tend to say at 18 months is\nstill more or less accepted as kind of\n\n154\n00:08:39.876 --> 00:08:43.701\nthe line where you expect to\nsee your data double in size.\n\n155\n00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:47.513\nBut that doesn't mean just because your\ndata doubles in size that everything all\n\n156\n00:08:47.513 --> 00:08:49.608\nof a sudden is magically really important.\n\n157\n00:08:49.608 --> 00:08:54.590\nData, information, whatever doubles\nin size, even at your home.\n\n158\n00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.709\nYou look at the stuff that you have now,\nreceipts, and for things you may be\n\n159\n00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:05.168\ndoing to take off your taxes or your\nbills, or what have you, all those things.\n\n160\n00:09:05.168 --> 00:09:10.454\nThose just double, and every 18 months\nyou get more and more of those.\n\n161\n00:09:10.454 --> 00:09:13.486\nOver that period of time,\nyou will double it in size on average, or\n\n162\n00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:15.011\ndo something pretty close to it.\n\n163\n00:09:15.011 --> 00:09:18.100\nDoes it mean that every little\nreceipt that you have is handy?\n\n164\n00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.169\nNo, if you're going through McDonald's,\nor some drive in, or you're\n\n165\n00:09:23.169 --> 00:09:29.076\nbuying something at the grocery store,\nthat's not really sensitive information.\n\n166\n00:09:29.076 --> 00:09:30.028\nI don't know what you're buying.\n\n167\n00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:32.350\nBut who knows?\n\n168\n00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.215\nIt's got secret sauce, man,\nthat's why I got to keep it secret.\n\n169\n00:09:35.215 --> 00:09:36.747\n>> That's right.\n\n170\n00:09:36.747 --> 00:09:40.394\n[LAUGHING].\n>> But you don't know that everything\n\n171\n00:09:40.394 --> 00:09:44.480\nin there's gonna be kept the same way.\n\n172\n00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.072\nYour receipts from,\nlike I said, your fast food,\n\n173\n00:09:46.072 --> 00:09:47.960\nyour grocery are probably\nnot the big deal.\n\n174\n00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.756\nBut when you go and\n\n175\n00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:54.990\nyou look at stuff like your tax forms\nyou get at the beginning of the year,\n\n176\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.900\nstuff like that, with your Social and\nthen medical records and all that.\n\n177\n00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.440\nThat's a lot more sensitive.\n\n178\n00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.580\nSo we see, just in the household we see\na difference in the types of information.\n\n179\n00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:11.348\nSame thing with a business, you can have\nstuff generated in the company picnic and\n\n180\n00:10:11.348 --> 00:10:15.706\nstuff on, hey,\nsomething new's coming out, or whatever.\n\n181\n00:10:15.706 --> 00:10:17.709\nUp to emails and communications and\n\n182\n00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:21.582\ndata that contain very personal\ninformation about your customers,\n\n183\n00:10:21.582 --> 00:10:25.670\nstuff about business operations,\nproprietary product information.\n\n184\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:30.735\nAnd then you have stuff that would\nbe considered trade secrets that\n\n185\n00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:37.365\nno one else can have because it would take\nyour advantage away, those type of things.\n\n186\n00:10:37.365 --> 00:10:39.385\nYou can keep going on and on and on.\n\n187\n00:10:39.385 --> 00:10:43.695\nYou have to figure out what those\nassets are in each one of those things.\n\n188\n00:10:43.695 --> 00:10:47.645\nOnce you do it, now let's start figuring\nout what's more valuable than others.\n\n189\n00:10:47.645 --> 00:10:49.746\nBecause some of those things you're gonna\nput a lot more weight on than other stuff.\n\n190\n00:10:49.746 --> 00:10:52.161\nIt's like, you just wad it up in\na ball and throw it in the trash.\n\n191\n00:10:52.161 --> 00:10:58.081\nI don't care if someone sees that we had,\nthe cafeteria was serving ribs today.\n\n192\n00:10:58.081 --> 00:10:59.690\nI don't care.\n\n193\n00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.450\n>> And that's really what, when it\ncomes to information classification,\n\n194\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.930\nI guess, is the big part of it\nbecause we can't just say data.\n\n195\n00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.450\nData has certain risks associated with it.\n\n196\n00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.276\nWe talked about like corruption or\ndeletion or theft.\n\n197\n00:11:11.276 --> 00:11:15.750\nBut I'm not gonna apply the same\nmitigation techniques to all\n\n198\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.330\nmy data because some data is\nmore valuable than others.\n\n199\n00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.630\nAnd so that's why we have\nthat classification is so\n\n200\n00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.560\nwe can figure out, all right, this data\nwe got to back it up four times a day.\n\n201\n00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.090\nWe got to keep a copy off site.\n\n202\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.580\nWe've got to do this and that.\n\n203\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.990\nWhereas this other data,\nmaybe I back it up once a week,\n\n204\n00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.930\nand I'm not worried about an offsite\ncopy or something like that.\n\n205\n00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.984\nSo- [CROSSTALK]\n>> I think there's a point brought up\n\n206\n00:11:37.984 --> 00:11:38.690\nin here.\n\n207\n00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:43.259\nI think that's another good example that\nRoberto brings up up in here about what,\n\n208\n00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:45.455\nbusiness factors, he was calling it.\n\n209\n00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:50.555\nIn a software project,\nhow many developers need to lose to\n\n210\n00:11:50.555 --> 00:11:53.495\ndestroy institutional memory and\nhalt its progress.\n\n211\n00:11:53.495 --> 00:11:56.052\nThat's something that businesses\nhave had to deal with too.\n\n212\n00:11:56.052 --> 00:11:58.220\nIt's not just in there, but yeah,\n\n213\n00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.342\nif you have enough people inside\nyour company working on a project,\n\n214\n00:12:02.342 --> 00:12:06.266\nyou gotta be concerned if they,\nif those people start leaving.\n\n215\n00:12:06.266 --> 00:12:10.114\nEnough people leave,\neven though you have stuff documented,\n\n216\n00:12:10.114 --> 00:12:14.050\nit can really slow down or\neven stop the progress or something.\n\n217\n00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:14.940\nI have seen that.\n\n218\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.630\nNot in software development, but\nI remember when I worked in the defense\n\n219\n00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:21.810\nindustry, I was coming out of\nhigh school working in that.\n\n220\n00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.761\nYou still see it in that industry\nwhere they'll find someone,\n\n221\n00:12:25.761 --> 00:12:27.408\nit's not a common thing.\n\n222\n00:12:27.408 --> 00:12:31.888\nBut it does happen where they find\nsomeone that is very, very talented, and\n\n223\n00:12:31.888 --> 00:12:33.224\nthey do a closer look.\n\n224\n00:12:33.224 --> 00:12:35.887\nAnd they say, oh,\nwell it's not just that one person,\n\n225\n00:12:35.887 --> 00:12:39.004\nwe want that whole team,\nbecause that whole team has a synergy and\n\n226\n00:12:39.004 --> 00:12:42.250\nall that amongst them that makes\nthem really, really productive.\n\n227\n00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.522\nSo, you'd get a competitor that'd say,\nhey, I'm gonna offer you and\n\n228\n00:12:45.522 --> 00:12:47.467\nall the people on your\nteam jobs over here.\n\n229\n00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:50.090\nI'm gonna give you this much raise and\nbenefits and all that, and\n\n230\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:53.300\nthey would just yank the whole team\nover and stick them someplace else.\n\n231\n00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.150\nAnd that could mean if you're the company\nthat's losing that, that could mean that\n\n232\n00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.310\nyour progress or whatever, your ability\nto deliver on a contract is gone.\n\n233\n00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.757\nYou're cut off at the knees cuz\nthere's no one else that has that.\n\n234\n00:13:04.757 --> 00:13:06.840\nIt's not just one person being lost.\n\n235\n00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.898\nIt's a whole team being lost,\nand talented at that.\n\n236\n00:13:09.898 --> 00:13:11.710\nThat's a huge thing.\n\n237\n00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.980\nThat's why companies had to put in\nstuff like, you hear stuff like they\n\n238\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.730\ncouldn't, non-compete stuff.\n\n239\n00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.810\nYou can't go to competitor.\n\n240\n00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.460\nIf you go to a competitor, there's a\ncertain period of time where you can't use\n\n241\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.620\nthat knowledge for anything even close.\n\n242\n00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.280\nThere would be all sorts of things that\nthey'd put in place to kind of say,\n\n243\n00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.730\nwell, it's kind of like poison pill, so\n\n244\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.910\nto speak cuz that company can\ngobble you up and take you.\n\n245\n00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.723\nBut, if there is a non-compete,\n\n246\n00:13:39.723 --> 00:13:44.512\nby the time they can get you,\nit's too late for them.\n\n247\n00:13:44.512 --> 00:13:46.693\nAnd if there's not that in place,\nif they take you,\n\n248\n00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:49.233\nthey can't use that knowledge in any way,\nshape, or form.\n\n249\n00:13:49.233 --> 00:13:51.360\nYou have to put them in\nplace someplace else.\n\n250\n00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.490\nSo, that means that the reason why\nyou're paying them that amount of money,\n\n251\n00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.700\nthey can't do right now anyway.\n\n252\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.100\nSo it makes acquiring them much tougher.\n\n253\n00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.960\n>> Exactly, and then when we get done\nwith our information classification,\n\n254\n00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.520\nthen we can move on into\nour risk assessment.\n\n255\n00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.601\nThat's really where what we're trying to\nfigure out what risks this particular\n\n256\n00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:14.456\npiece of, I don't know if it's data,\nor person, or whatever are facing?\n\n257\n00:14:14.456 --> 00:14:17.118\n>> Yeah,\nwhen you do a risk assessment, yeah,\n\n258\n00:14:17.118 --> 00:14:20.213\nit's really once you've\ngotten all these things.\n\n259\n00:14:20.213 --> 00:14:22.895\nYou've figured out what assets you have,\nand\n\n260\n00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:27.777\nall the different shades of the importance\nof those assets and all that, then yeah,\n\n261\n00:14:27.777 --> 00:14:30.755\nyou're gonna start moving\ninto risk assessment.\n\n262\n00:14:30.755 --> 00:14:33.426\nYou're gonna spend some\ngood time here too.\n\n263\n00:14:33.426 --> 00:14:37.140\nAnd that's really,\nkinda when you get down to it,\n\n264\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.970\nyou can spend a lot of time there,\nbecause you're breaking down under risk.\n\n265\n00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.850\nYou're breaking down it to threats and\nvulnerabilities and\n\n266\n00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.350\nthe likelihood of those things happening.\n\n267\n00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.100\nAnd the amount of digging and\n\n268\n00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:56.030\nresearch you may have to do to actually\nuncover those things could be tremendous.\n\n269\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.691\nAnd it's gonna be tremendous an even\nsteeper slope to go up if you have someone\n\n270\n00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:02.780\non the outside trying to help you.\n\n271\n00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.680\nIt doesn't mean you shouldn't\nget someone on the outside.\n\n272\n00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.914\nYou could ask someone like me to\nhelp you do a risk assessment.\n\n273\n00:15:07.914 --> 00:15:11.874\nBut once you start going to certain\nparts of the country, for example,\n\n274\n00:15:11.874 --> 00:15:16.641\nunder certain situations, I know how the\nreassessment process is supposed to work.\n\n275\n00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:19.167\nI know the types of information\nwe're supposed to get, but\n\n276\n00:15:19.167 --> 00:15:21.454\nI don't know the specifics\nabout your environment.\n\n277\n00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:24.445\nSo I mean,\nif you take me someplace in the Midwest or\n\n278\n00:15:24.445 --> 00:15:28.900\nsomeplace where there's a lot of snow and\nthere's tornadoes and all that,\n\n279\n00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.350\nI don't know anything about that stuff.\n\n280\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:36.532\nI just don't know what type of\nrisks those pose specifically,\n\n281\n00:15:36.532 --> 00:15:39.188\nso I would need to work with you.\n\n282\n00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:43.293\nWork with perhaps insurance companies\nthat also do this type of data,\n\n283\n00:15:43.293 --> 00:15:46.440\nlaw enforcement, whoever,\nand acquire that data.\n\n284\n00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.798\nI'd have to get the knowledge\nthat's in place or\n\n285\n00:15:48.798 --> 00:15:51.221\nother sources to pull that\nfrom to be able to do it.\n\n286\n00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:54.963\nSo it would take longer, even, to do it,\nbut it doesn't mean it's a bad thing.\n\n287\n00:15:54.963 --> 00:15:56.997\nIt just means you better be prepared for\nthat.\n\n288\n00:15:56.997 --> 00:15:58.308\nAnd you never know.\n\n289\n00:15:58.308 --> 00:16:02.664\nYou can't just walk into\nan environment and assume that hey,\n\n290\n00:16:02.664 --> 00:16:04.350\nI'm the hot shot here.\n\n291\n00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:08.200\nI know what type of risks are there\nbecause I've seen it all before.\n\n292\n00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.890\nNo, no, there's stuff that's inherent to\na certain organization or business, and\n\n293\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.130\nthere's stuff that's even\ninherent to a location.\n\n294\n00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.020\nI've been in locations where\nI would never have even\n\n295\n00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.080\nthought that this was the problem.\n\n296\n00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.620\nBut you had everything look normal, but\nif you went down maybe, about a foot,\n\n297\n00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.400\nmaybe even less than that,\nthe water table was right there.\n\n298\n00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.220\nAnd that meant running cables was\ngonna be a big project because it\n\n299\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.961\nwasn't undoable, but\nnow copper kinda goes [NOISE] out of that.\n\n300\n00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:42.113\nOut of the picture you've kinda\ngot to figure fiber optics and\n\n301\n00:16:42.113 --> 00:16:43.210\nstuff like that now.\n\n302\n00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:48.070\nSo that changed your planning cuz\nyour risk assessment told you,\n\n303\n00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:52.652\nhey you can run copper or wires in\nthere but it's not really a good idea.\n\n304\n00:16:52.652 --> 00:16:54.366\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The risk is kinda high.\n\n305\n00:16:54.366 --> 00:16:59.168\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, there'll be little\nissues with that you can address but it's\n\n306\n00:16:59.168 --> 00:17:03.968\nprobably not worth it in the scheme of\nthings, like spend more money up front and\n\n307\n00:17:03.968 --> 00:17:08.719\nthen you get a longer term solution which\ncomes out cheaper over the long term.\n\n308\n00:17:08.719 --> 00:17:13.842\nSo doing a risk assessment is going to,\nis invaluable it's going\n\n309\n00:17:13.842 --> 00:17:19.700\nto take some time, it's how you can,\nperform a risk assessment.\n\n310\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.470\nYou've got plenty of options to do that,\nI guess kind of fits into it.\n\n311\n00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.410\nYour options for\nperforming a risk assessment are many.\n\n312\n00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.850\nOne of the things that was mentioned was\nthe quantitative and qualitative stuff.\n\n313\n00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.580\nThat comes back into play.\n\n314\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:37.480\nIs those subject matter experts are also\ngonna have, locked in their gray matter,\n\n315\n00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:42.810\nare gonna have ideas because\npresumably they work with this stuff.\n\n316\n00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.144\nThey're the ones that\nare gonna be able tell you,\n\n317\n00:17:45.144 --> 00:17:46.708\nwhat type of risks are out there.\n\n318\n00:17:46.708 --> 00:17:49.761\nSo you're gonna ask them, you're gonna\npull logs of stuff that's happened,\n\n319\n00:17:49.761 --> 00:17:51.413\nincidents that have happened in the past.\n\n320\n00:17:51.413 --> 00:17:54.975\nMaybe look at similar companies,\nlook at news reports even and\n\n321\n00:17:54.975 --> 00:17:59.236\nkinda bring that all on to figure\nout what all those things are.\n\n322\n00:17:59.236 --> 00:18:02.960\nSome might add into that with options\nwhile you're doing this is you do\n\n323\n00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.220\nhave the two types of analysis,\nthe Quantitative and the Qualitative.\n\n324\n00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.663\nAnother one to throw in there is the fact\nthat what you do when you get all these\n\n325\n00:18:10.663 --> 00:18:15.606\npersonalities into a Into a room that's\nsomething that can be counterproductive.\n\n326\n00:18:15.606 --> 00:18:19.774\nWhen you get a lot of personalities,\nespecially strong personalities which I\n\n327\n00:18:19.774 --> 00:18:23.623\nhad saved you are gonna get people that\nare key stakeholders or leaders or\n\n328\n00:18:23.623 --> 00:18:26.421\nthe subject matter experts\nin their specific area.\n\n329\n00:18:26.421 --> 00:18:29.611\nThose people tend to, I don't know why,\n\n330\n00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:32.984\nthey tend to have their\nego inflated a bit and\n\n331\n00:18:32.984 --> 00:18:37.922\nthey just want to sit there and,\nkind of almost box one another.\n\n332\n00:18:37.922 --> 00:18:39.784\nAnd show their knowledge and all that, but\n\n333\n00:18:39.784 --> 00:18:43.525\ninevitably you'll get people that are just\nlike I don't really want to talk in this.\n\n334\n00:18:43.525 --> 00:18:48.327\nAnd so because they just don't want\nto deal with it, in those situations,\n\n335\n00:18:48.327 --> 00:18:51.316\nnot everyone's going to\nwant to be like that.\n\n336\n00:18:51.316 --> 00:18:54.184\nI'll get in this thing just like\nwhen I was younger I'd be like okay,\n\n337\n00:18:54.184 --> 00:18:55.826\ncome on, let's go, throw them down.\n\n338\n00:18:55.826 --> 00:19:00.038\nNow it's like okay when you guys are done,\njust ask me stuff,\n\n339\n00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:03.685\nif I was in a corporate environment,\nI would do that.\n\n340\n00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:06.725\nSo, how do you get that knowledge?\n\n341\n00:19:06.725 --> 00:19:08.130\nCuz I know, I'm kind of that way.\n\n342\n00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.268\nI don't want to sit here and\nyell and talk over people.\n\n343\n00:19:10.268 --> 00:19:14.120\nI'll give you the information I have,\nthat's it, but\n\n344\n00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.470\nwhen you get that type of dynamic in\nplace, if I'm leading the whole thing,\n\n345\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.530\nI'm gonna say, I know there's people that\nhave that attitude, so what do I do?\n\n346\n00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.945\nI'll just distribute questionnaires or\nsomething like through email or\n\n347\n00:19:24.945 --> 00:19:26.895\nwhat have you, and\nsay this is just a one on one thing.\n\n348\n00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:29.875\nNo one else sees it, you tell me what\nyou think, don't pull any punches.\n\n349\n00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:30.705\nTell me what's going on.\n\n350\n00:19:30.705 --> 00:19:33.725\nNo one's gonna shout you down or\ncall you an idiot or anything else.\n\n351\n00:19:33.725 --> 00:19:35.545\nTell me what's on your mind.\n\n352\n00:19:35.545 --> 00:19:37.945\nAnd that way you can get that information\n\n353\n00:19:37.945 --> 00:19:41.285\nunlocked from these people that wouldn't\ntalk about it at the meeting necessarily.\n\n354\n00:19:41.285 --> 00:19:44.965\n>> All right, and then once we've\ndone our risk analysis, and\n\n355\n00:19:44.965 --> 00:19:46.435\nlet me refresh,\nmake sure I got that right.\n\n356\n00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:49.635\nSo the quantitative is where we\nare gonna asign number values to it.\n\n357\n00:19:49.635 --> 00:19:50.506\n>> Yes.\n\n358\n00:19:50.506 --> 00:19:52.250\n>> Or dollar values typically?\n\n359\n00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.208\nAnd then the qualitative is where\nthings like low, medium and high.\n\n360\n00:19:56.208 --> 00:19:57.690\n>> Yeah.\n>> And more like that?\n\n361\n00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.890\n>> Yeah, the way I look at it,\nwhen you look at qualitative and\n\n362\n00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:07.680\nquantitive it's kind of\na simplistic way but it works.\n\n363\n00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.950\nYou look at the root word of those,\nquantity.\n\n364\n00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.410\nQuantity we know, when we,\nwe relate to that.\n\n365\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.860\nHow many, how many do you want?\n\n366\n00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.910\nSo that tells me right away.\n\n367\n00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.432\nIt's a scale based value.\n\n368\n00:20:18.432 --> 00:20:20.100\nHow many?\n\n369\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.640\nOkay.\nI can easily get that, and\n\n370\n00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.260\nyou look at the other side, qualitative.\n\n371\n00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.636\nQualitative is something that when\nyou look at the word Quality.\n\n372\n00:20:28.636 --> 00:20:31.000\nQuality is very subjective term.\n\n373\n00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.220\nAs, really anybody, if you really\nget down to it, can attest to.\n\n374\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.100\nThere's people that if you ask,\nI mean heck, if you ask a kid or\n\n375\n00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.374\nsomething like that what the best movie or\nsomething is.\n\n376\n00:20:44.374 --> 00:20:48.270\nYeah, be prepared for\nsome stuff you'll look at and go really?\n\n377\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:54.874\nIt's like have years go, having an\nex-girlfriend of mine saying her daughter\n\n378\n00:20:54.874 --> 00:20:59.811\nwas like oh, that woman that was in\nthe twilight movies or something.\n\n379\n00:20:59.811 --> 00:21:00.670\nKristen Stewart.\n\n380\n00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.760\nShe was like that's the best actress ever.\n\n381\n00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.480\nAnd I'm like [LAUGH] I was,\nthat's her opinion.\n\n382\n00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.185\nAnd apparently opinions can be wrong,\nbecause hers was definitely wrong.\n\n383\n00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:11.034\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n384\n00:21:11.034 --> 00:21:12.823\nshe says that's the best actress ever,\n\n385\n00:21:12.823 --> 00:21:14.950\nand I'm like I thought\nthis was a zombie movie.\n\n386\n00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.006\nI'm kidding I never watched the movies.\n\n387\n00:21:17.006 --> 00:21:22.021\n[LAUGH] But, now the thing is, I always\nthought they should merge the Twilight\n\n388\n00:21:22.021 --> 00:21:26.438\nmovies with Blade it would have\nbeen a much more interesting movie.\n\n389\n00:21:26.438 --> 00:21:29.611\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But yeah, you look at that,\n\n390\n00:21:29.611 --> 00:21:31.760\nthat's someones opinion.\n\n391\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.890\nWhen you look at someone that's older\nit's gonna say I'm definitely not gonna\n\n392\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.090\nsay what I wouldn't think.\n\n393\n00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:40.770\nBut, it's a matter of opinion.\n\n394\n00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.436\nWhen you talk about quality.\n\n395\n00:21:42.436 --> 00:21:45.528\nIt's absolutely a 100%\na matter of opinion.\n\n396\n00:21:45.528 --> 00:21:48.990\nSo, you've kinda gotta throw that in,\nso the low, medium,\n\n397\n00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.180\nhigh would be something that would be\nsubjective based on who you're talking to.\n\n398\n00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.850\n>> And then once we've done our\nassessment, our analysis, the next thing\n\n399\n00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.730\nto do is try to put some controls\nin place to protect whatever it is,\n\n400\n00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.600\nour assets that we're trying to protect.\n\n401\n00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.010\n>> Yeah,\nonce you've figured out the impact and\n\n402\n00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:09.230\nhow likely something is to happen, and\nwhat the extent of the issue would be.\n\n403\n00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.170\nThen you get into implementing controls.\n\n404\n00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:16.030\nWhat you're trying to do is, you're\ntrying to really take one of a number of\n\n405\n00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.390\napproaches when you put\nthese controls in place.\n\n406\n00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.460\nOr maybe, just maybe, you're not gonna\nput any controls in place at all.\n\n407\n00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.190\nThat's the thing.\n\n408\n00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.350\nJust because you did a risk analysis\ndoes not, in any way, shape or form,\n\n409\n00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:31.970\nmean that you're setting out with\nthe goal of buying some shiny new toys.\n\n410\n00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.560\nWhat you're doing here is figuring\nout what your risk level is.\n\n411\n00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.400\nThat's it.\n\n412\n00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.180\nThat doesn't mean anything else.\n\n413\n00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.710\nOnce you find that risk that levels out,\n\n414\n00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.680\nthen you can decide, well,\nwhat's the next step here?\n\n415\n00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.730\nSo, what you will determine, before,\n\n416\n00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:51.090\nwhen this whole process is happening is\nwhat level of risk you are wiling to have.\n\n417\n00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.550\nMeaning what type of down time,\n\n418\n00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.570\nmoney you're willing to spend,\nman power you have.\n\n419\n00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:57.810\nThose type of things.\n\n420\n00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.970\nOnce you've assessed it and figure out\nwhere you are in relation to that, it's\n\n421\n00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:06.410\njust measuring your level of risk really\ndoesn't do much for you just on its own.\n\n422\n00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:11.289\nBecause you know how much risk you have,\nokay, well who's to say that\n\n423\n00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:15.929\nthis level of risk is, this is a lot or\nthis is a lot or who's to say.\n\n424\n00:23:15.929 --> 00:23:21.648\nWhat you wanna do is you want to figure\nout yeah, and have a reference point.\n\n425\n00:23:21.648 --> 00:23:25.902\nSo that reference point or that line would\nbe something that you determine ahead of\n\n426\n00:23:25.902 --> 00:23:29.355\ntime and said okay, if it's above this or\nbelow this or whatever,\n\n427\n00:23:29.355 --> 00:23:31.528\nwe're gonna take actions based on that.\n\n428\n00:23:31.528 --> 00:23:34.778\nAnd those actions can be,\nfor example you can accept,\n\n429\n00:23:34.778 --> 00:23:38.181\nyou can just find with the risk\nof list and say it's fine.\n\n430\n00:23:38.181 --> 00:23:39.928\nI'm accepting it the way it is.\n\n431\n00:23:39.928 --> 00:23:44.203\nThere's nothing really here for\nme to change.\n\n432\n00:23:44.203 --> 00:23:47.008\nOkay?\nIf that's the case you can sign off on it\n\n433\n00:23:47.008 --> 00:23:48.943\nand say we're leaving it as is.\n\n434\n00:23:48.943 --> 00:23:54.223\nThat's perfectly, no pun intended,\nperfectly acceptable to do because\n\n435\n00:23:54.223 --> 00:23:59.352\nyou found out that there's really\nnot much variation or any variation.\n\n436\n00:23:59.352 --> 00:24:02.302\nThat's going to cause you to\nnot really want to do anything.\n\n437\n00:24:02.302 --> 00:24:04.760\nSo, leave it the way it is.\n\n438\n00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.020\nThen you can mitigate it.\n\n439\n00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.330\nMitigate it means that you've decided that\nthat's not in line with your goals so\n\n440\n00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.850\nyou want to lower it to something\nthat's more acceptable to you.\n\n441\n00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:20.060\nThen you can also do a transference which\nis where you give it to a third party.\n\n442\n00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.740\nThat means insurance for example,\n\n443\n00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.670\nyou purchase insurance to cover that and\nthen one\n\n444\n00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:29.480\nof the one you don't want to see is you\ndon't wanna see a denial type situation.\n\n445\n00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.710\nDenial means that someone is just,\nsaying somewhere, no,\n\n446\n00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.570\nthis doesn't exist the way it is.\n\n447\n00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:40.706\nThey're kind of just putting their\nfingers in their ears and ignoring you.\n\n448\n00:24:40.706 --> 00:24:43.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's incredibly bad if they're doing\n\n449\n00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.800\nthat because they're not even addressing,\nor\n\n450\n00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.350\nnot even acknowledging the existence\nof whatever it is you brought to them.\n\n451\n00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.880\nIf that's the case, you could have\na bad situation down the road.\n\n452\n00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.650\nNot always, but you very well could.\n\n453\n00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.700\nYou're going to want to get\ndocumentation and in any of these cases,\n\n454\n00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.250\nespecially that one to make sure that\nis understood that this is brought to\n\n455\n00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:09.030\nattention, this wasn't addressed, but\nwas definitely brought to attention.\n\n456\n00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:12.870\nSo you need to figure which one of\nthose actions you're gonna take.\n\n457\n00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.700\nNow if its something like transference or\n\n458\n00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.870\nmitigation, then you're gonna figure out\nwhat controls are you gonna be required\n\n459\n00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.690\nto bring that in to compliance\nwith what you need.\n\n460\n00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:24.570\nIf you're gonna transfer someone else,\n\n461\n00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:27.710\nwhat level of insurance are you\ngonna need if that's an option?\n\n462\n00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:33.410\nIf you have any situation where you can\ndo just do plain mitigation, well, then,\n\n463\n00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:37.350\nwhat was your target goal and where are\nyou in relation to your target goal, and\n\n464\n00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:41.940\nwhat can you do given all\nthe cost measures and budget?\n\n465\n00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.100\nWhat can you do to bring\nit into compliance and\n\n466\n00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.860\nstill stay within budget and\nstill stay on point with this.\n\n467\n00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.250\nSo the controls aren't just as simple as,\noh well, that's the problem,\n\n468\n00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.020\njust start bolting some stuff in place.\n\n469\n00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.210\nAbsolutely not.\n\n470\n00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.490\nIt's much more than that.\n\n471\n00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.960\n>> And then we've got to make\nsure that we stay on top of it.\n\n472\n00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.870\nLike you said earlier, things change.\n\n473\n00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:06.050\nSo we can't just do a risk analysis and\nrisk assessment once and\n\n474\n00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:06.830\nforget about it, right?\n\n475\n00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.555\nWe've got to continuously monitor?\n\n476\n00:26:09.555 --> 00:26:14.444\n>> Yeah, don't just assume this\nis a fire and forget type thing,\n\n477\n00:26:14.444 --> 00:26:18.280\nwhere you put the stuff out there and\nit works.\n\n478\n00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.790\nNo, you have to have\ncontinuous monitoring, and\n\n479\n00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.300\ncontinuous monitoring is just that.\n\n480\n00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.620\nIt means that you're keeping an eye on it,\n\n481\n00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.940\nmaking sure those things are working\nthe way they're supposed to.\n\n482\n00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.030\nIf they're not,\n\n483\n00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:33.750\nthen you'll take corrective actions\nto bring them into compliance.\n\n484\n00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:37.930\nThat's gonna happen sometimes, that\nsomething's not going to go as planned so\n\n485\n00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:42.590\nnow you kinda gotta get in there and\ntweak it to make sure it does.\n\n486\n00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.610\nAnd hopefully it's the case\nof doing some adjustment.\n\n487\n00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:48.476\nSometimes when they implemented things,\nthey found out they don't work as planned.\n\n488\n00:26:48.476 --> 00:26:51.330\nI know it's surprising.\n\n489\n00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:52.860\nStuff doesn't go as planned, so\n\n490\n00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:58.820\nwhat you have to do is make some\nadjustments to figure out what you can do.\n\n491\n00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.970\nIf not, maybe you'll have\nto tear it out and redo it.\n\n492\n00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.850\nThat does happen unfortunately.\n\n493\n00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.420\nYou need to have that, but\n\n494\n00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.450\nyou're not going to know it unless\nyou're just continuously monitoring.\n\n495\n00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:16.408\nIt's also important to note that\ncontinuous monitoring is a requirement in\n\n496\n00:27:16.408 --> 00:27:20.730\nmost cases, you just can't put\na plan in place and not monitor it.\n\n497\n00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:23.840\nBecause you could have\nan outside agency that says,\n\n498\n00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.980\nyou put the stuff in place that's great,\nwhen's the last time you verified it?\n\n499\n00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:31.040\nAbout three years ago, that's good, right?\n\n500\n00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.650\nNo, probably not.\n\n501\n00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.030\n>> Just a little while ago.\n\n502\n00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.705\n>> Yeah,\nit's not that big of a deal, right?\n\n503\n00:27:36.705 --> 00:27:39.000\n[LAUGH]\n>> Then there are some,\n\n504\n00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.420\nare there some frameworks\nthat we can look at?\n\n505\n00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.750\nLike are there certain guidelines we\ncan follow for certain industries or?\n\n506\n00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:49.220\n>> Well there's,\nthere's almost an endless sea of those and\n\n507\n00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:54.590\nit would be almost, essentially\nimpossible to go through them all.\n\n508\n00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.590\nBut there's plenty of them out there.\n\n509\n00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:00.409\nThere's ones from ISO,\nfrom ISA, or no ISO.\n\n510\n00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.760\nThere's ones from the federal government,\n\n511\n00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.720\nthere's ones from you\nknow different countries.\n\n512\n00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.540\nYou know there's so many of these\nthings that tell you processes\n\n513\n00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:17.440\nto follow and have things included and\nthat pertain to this process.\n\n514\n00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.110\nI mean you could look at stuff like Cobit,\nfor example.\n\n515\n00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.290\nIt's got stuff that relates to this plus.\n\n516\n00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.510\nThere's other ones out there, too.\n\n517\n00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.480\nThe question is which one pertains to you.\n\n518\n00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.820\nIf you're not in a regulated industry\nthen you have a little more latitude.\n\n519\n00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.060\nSo if you're not in one of those\naforementioned industries then there's\n\n520\n00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.630\nadditional, then there's\nadditional stuff out there for\n\n521\n00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:39.980\nyou too that you can be\na lot more broad on it.\n\n522\n00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.670\nMost people like to follow at\nleast some sort of standard.\n\n523\n00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.860\nEven if you're not regulated, they like\nto follow at least some sort of standard.\n\n524\n00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.480\nBecause who knows?\n\n525\n00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.520\nMaybe whatever you're doing today\ncatches the eye of someone else and\n\n526\n00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.950\nthey're saying we could work with you.\n\n527\n00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:58.310\nWe want to be able to do this and\nyou've got a solution.\n\n528\n00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:01.320\nMaybe you never thought about\nthis combination of products and\n\n529\n00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.360\nservices happening but\nwhat someone else did.\n\n530\n00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.540\nThey came to you.\n\n531\n00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:08.270\nNow they need to be on the same page,\nspeak the same language as you.\n\n532\n00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:13.748\nIf you made your stuff up completely\nfrom scratch, that's fine.\n\n533\n00:29:13.748 --> 00:29:15.100\nIt works great for you, but\n\n534\n00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:19.360\nif you need to collaborate and\nform part of a larger ecosystem.\n\n535\n00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.280\nYou are going to have to figure\nways to speak the same language.\n\n536\n00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.140\nThey are probably not going to\ncut you too much slack on that.\n\n537\n00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.640\nEspecially when you start getting\nthe larger and larger contracts.\n\n538\n00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.530\nIf they invite you in,\nthey are responsible for you.\n\n539\n00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:35.290\nThey want to make sure you are speaking\nthat language and know what is going on.\n\n540\n00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:37.440\nAnd if not, that may be enough to say,\n\n541\n00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:43.350\nyou can't participate on this because\nyou don't follow accepted guidelines.\n\n542\n00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:48.540\nSo most places will try to do something\nat least as close as possible,\n\n543\n00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.940\njust something like ISO, or\nsomething that's fairly generic.\n\n544\n00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:57.670\nWhich can be clearly followed or related\nto one of the other ones, but you don't\n\n545\n00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.480\nnecessarily always have that option of\njust choosing what you want at the buffet.\n\n546\n00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.190\nSometimes you just gotta say,\nthis is what you're following.\n\n547\n00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:06.240\nYou're in this industry,\nyou're following this.\n\n548\n00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.430\nAny questions?\n\n549\n00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.860\nThat's your choice, right there.\n\n550\n00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.030\nSo you definitely need to be\nthinking about all those.\n\n551\n00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:16.180\n>> All right, well a lot of great\ninformation again about that risk analysis\n\n552\n00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.900\nprocess.\n\n553\n00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.750\nAny closing words on this one?\n\n554\n00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.470\n>> No, I think that's kind\nof like the big part of it.\n\n555\n00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:28.030\nIf you understand that process, and\n\n556\n00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:32.680\nactually let me do expand this out\na bit now that I think about it.\n\n557\n00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:38.330\nIf you are someone that's been through\nstuff like the A+ Net+ Security+, or\n\n558\n00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:41.660\nanything like that, we hadn't even talked\nabout that in our forensics course, and\n\n559\n00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.400\nstuff like that.\n\n560\n00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.940\nThere are different frameworks\nthat are mentioned,\n\n561\n00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.800\nthere are different steps that come in in\ndifferent ways of doing risk assessment,\n\n562\n00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:55.840\nso this can get really big really quickly.\n\n563\n00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.650\nBut, you will find it pretty much\nfollows the same type of procedure,\n\n564\n00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.510\nlike a standard procedure.\n\n565\n00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:03.155\nI would tell you if you've been\nthrough the other Com J Exams: A+,\n\n566\n00:31:03.155 --> 00:31:05.757\nNet+, Security+, you're probably\nin pretty good shape as far\n\n567\n00:31:05.757 --> 00:31:07.970\nas understanding the risk\nassessment process.\n\n568\n00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.310\nThey're just adding some\nmore meat on to it.\n\n569\n00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:13.720\nSo give you that little skeleton\nthey had and the other courses.\n\n570\n00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.580\nThat's a good thing.\n\n571\n00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.230\nEspecially if you been through Security+.\n\n572\n00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.830\nThey've given you that,\n\n573\n00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:23.585\nwe're just adding more meat on to it\nhere so you're already on a good track.\n\n574\n00:31:23.585 --> 00:31:25.180\n>> Good.\n\n575\n00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:26.960\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's going to do it for this one.\n\n576\n00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.320\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n577\n00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.595\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n578\n00:31:32.595 --> 00:31:37.440\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:14.230\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.770\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.830\nHow are you Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.590\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n7\n00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.400\nHow are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.110\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.450\nWe've got another CompTIA Advanced\nSecurity Practitioner episode\n\n10\n00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.620\ncoming your way and in this one\nwe're gonna be looking at policies,\n\n11\n00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.810\nprocedures and incident response, we're\nactually gonna take a long look at that.\n\n12\n00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.234\nThis one we just want to\ndo a high level overview.\n\n13\n00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:35.510\nThat 30,000 foot view, right Sean?\n\n14\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.850\n>> Yeah that's where you gotta enter this\nwhole discussion is you have to kind of\n\n15\n00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.000\ntake a look at it from from far away and\nthen you gotta go through the individual\n\n16\n00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.900\npieces of the beast to kinda see\nwhat's going on in each one.\n\n17\n00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.880\nBecause this is, I'll tell you,\ndoing policies, procedures, audits, for\n\n18\n00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.430\nthe most part I look at it as myself, it's\nonly paperwork and all that type of stuff.\n\n19\n00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.080\nI look at it and it's like yeah, it's\nkinda boring but its absolutely necessary.\n\n20\n00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.600\nYou will not have any sort of a business,\n\n21\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.090\nespecially the larger ones where\nit becomes even more of a factor,\n\n22\n00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.850\nyou will not see them operate without\nsome sort of policies in place.\n\n23\n00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.810\nIf they do they're just asking for\n\n24\n00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.770\nit, they're waiting for\nthe bad stuff to happen.\n\n25\n00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.030\nIt's not if, it's just a question\nof when it's going to occur.\n\n26\n00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.630\nSo policies, procedures are supposed\nto put something in place to\n\n27\n00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.700\nprevent those things from happening,\nat least reduce it as much as possible.\n\n28\n00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.300\n>> So what is it that these policies and\nprocedures do for us?\n\n29\n00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.180\nI mean, what is that, why, as a company,\nif I don't have them, am I gonna fail?\n\n30\n00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.900\n>> Well, what happens is,\nif you look at them,\n\n31\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.010\nthey're partially giving you a goal to aim\ntowards, they're set in kind of a mindset.\n\n32\n00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.820\nI think of it as sometimes\nas a mission statement.\n\n33\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.130\nWhen you look at, so\n\n34\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.910\nyou have that direction saying,\nokay, this is our mission statement.\n\n35\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.550\nThis is what we're going for.\n\n36\n00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.080\nAnd then you have ways,\nas you get further down from that and\n\n37\n00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.760\ngetting into the weeds,\nof actually accomplishing that task.\n\n38\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.340\n>> Any large organization is gonna\nhave some sort of high level idea\n\n39\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.010\nof which direction they're headed and\nwhy security is important to them.\n\n40\n00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.420\nAnd then they're gonna have\nit broken down after that,\n\n41\n00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.150\nbecause really a mission statement,\nwhen you look at a mission statement for\n\n42\n00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.730\nany organization,\nit doesn't really give you anything.\n\n43\n00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.440\nConsidered marching orders,\nwe're gonna provide good customer service,\n\n44\n00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.350\nthat's the mission statement.\n\n45\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.340\nWell, it doesn't say how you're\ngonna provide, it just says you are.\n\n46\n00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.430\nSo that's kind of part of the end\nit covers, and then, like I said,\n\n47\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.210\nit gets down into all the little details\nof how each thing is gonna happen.\n\n48\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.770\nSo it gets implemented from there on out.\n\n49\n00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.240\nAnd if you don't have it, you don't\nhave a goal you're going towards, or\n\n50\n00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.150\na mindset, or\n\n51\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.790\na motivation that's putting you that way,\nthen really what are you doing it for?\n\n52\n00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.960\n>> All right so where do start?\n\n53\n00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.540\nDo we have to start from scratch\nwith building these policies?\n\n54\n00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.970\nI've never built one before or\nwritten one before.\n\n55\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.020\nWhat is the general procedure I'm gonna\ngo through to create these policies?\n\n56\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.580\n>> Fortunately there's a lot of people\nin the same boat as you that may never\n\n57\n00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.460\nhave done that before, so if you've never\nhad to get into policy development,\n\n58\n00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.550\nor you've had very little\nexperience with it,\n\n59\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.325\nfortunately there's a lot\nof stuff to help you out.\n\n60\n00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:27.125\nBecause what they've done, and when I say\nthey, I mean the different industries,\n\n61\n00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:31.856\nas well as different,\nmore generic organizations\n\n62\n00:03:32.907 --> 00:03:36.697\nthat are kind of non-profits and\nstuff like that, have put together\n\n63\n00:03:36.697 --> 00:03:41.207\nsome standards to get you to fall or\nhelp you get on the right path.\n\n64\n00:03:41.207 --> 00:03:44.267\nIf you're in a regulated industry,\nhave some sort of legal requirement,\n\n65\n00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:46.963\nthen it's almost assured that\nthere's policies out there,\n\n66\n00:03:46.963 --> 00:03:48.513\nin some cases they're just boilerplate.\n\n67\n00:03:48.513 --> 00:03:51.363\nYou just copy them, paste them in\nyour stuff, replace a few names,\n\n68\n00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:54.629\nand there you go, and that's it.\n\n69\n00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.517\nOther ones,\nyou will have to take the guidance,\n\n70\n00:03:57.517 --> 00:04:02.230\nwhatever that standards body puts out and\nthen you have to take it and kind of\n\n71\n00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.220\nbuild your own policy that covers the same\nthing but customized to your situation.\n\n72\n00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.370\nAnd, in a few cases, yes you will\nhave to write them from scratch,\n\n73\n00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.618\nwe really don't have any choice.\n\n74\n00:04:12.618 --> 00:04:16.600\nBut, like I said, the fortunate thing on\nit is, is that get into policy when you\n\n75\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.770\nget to the larger business spaces,\nand larger enterprise organizations,\n\n76\n00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.660\nyou get into a situation where someones\nalready done that legwork for you, so\n\n77\n00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.850\nnow you just have to go and grab it,\nand customize or just use it as is.\n\n78\n00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.360\nI've seen plenty of organizations\njust grab the stuff off the shelf and\n\n79\n00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.890\nsay okay, hey,\nthis is gonna work the way it is.\n\n80\n00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.150\nBut other ones,\nwe'll have to take policies and say,\n\n81\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.090\nwell this is pretty close but I'm gonna\nchange some lines in here or cross these\n\n82\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.670\nout according to what the legal guys say,\ncan be crossed out and then if you're not\n\n83\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.690\nin one of those industries you can get\nsome of these generic standards bodies\n\n84\n00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.520\nthat put this stuff out there and say,\nokay, well here's one to get you started.\n\n85\n00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.100\nAnd you can use that as a blue print\nto figure out how to develop your own.\n\n86\n00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.330\nAnd the cool thing about that is it\ndoes give you some latitude, but\n\n87\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.560\nat the same time it doesn't just say well\n\n88\n00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.250\nwe're just gonna throw you to the wolves\nand you'll make it up as you go along,\n\n89\n00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.360\nand you'll know you did it\nwrong when someone sues you.\n\n90\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.090\nOkay.\nThat's not a good outcome.\n\n91\n00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.580\nWhat they will do is they will they\nwon't necessarily hand hold you through\n\n92\n00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.530\nthe whole process, but\nthey'll give you enough help\n\n93\n00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.520\nwhere you can get through it successfully\nand have something that protects you and\n\n94\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.580\nshows that you've really tried\nto establish some standard.\n\n95\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.900\n>> So we've got some place out there where\nwe can get these boiler plates from,\n\n96\n00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.700\nas you called them, or\ntemplates that we can use.\n\n97\n00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.148\nWhat about other industries or\n\n98\n00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:41.050\nbusinesses that have the same\ngeneral business plan as we do?\n\n99\n00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.060\n>> It can be another business that's\nin the same market segment as you, but\n\n100\n00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.741\nit could also be, if you look at stuff,\nfor example HIPAA.\n\n101\n00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:51.210\nHIPAA's got a standards body\nthat handles that and so\n\n102\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.630\nyou can go to them and\nthere's a lot of policies out there for\n\n103\n00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.250\nthat and so you can kind of comb through\nit to see which ones apply to you.\n\n104\n00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.470\nAnd as far as other people\nin your market segment,\n\n105\n00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.810\nyou may be able to get help from them.\n\n106\n00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.640\nSometimes they may not be\nwilling to really, you might be\n\n107\n00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.330\na competitor of course, then they're not\nreally as willing to assist you on that.\n\n108\n00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.820\nBut then there's cases where\nyou might be working with\n\n109\n00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.820\nsomeone else in the same industry or\nin another industry and\n\n110\n00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.900\nyou may have to create policies\nto work together effectively,\n\n111\n00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.430\nin which case you'll both collaborate\non creating one to make it happen.\n\n112\n00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.290\nEspecially if you're working\nin the same industry and\n\n113\n00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.590\none person needs to support another,\none company needs to support another.\n\n114\n00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.420\nThey'll probably be a lot\nmore forth coming and say,\n\n115\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.700\nhere's some policy documents.\n\n116\n00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.760\nHere you can look at ours on this and\n\n117\n00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.180\nthen you can use that to establish yours\nso we have a kind of this, commonality,\n\n118\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.850\nsomething that glues us together and\nmakes us work together more effectively.\n\n119\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.998\n>> And I know, the Sands Institute is\na big one, I think, where we go and\n\n120\n00:06:53.998 --> 00:06:57.440\nget a lot of those templates from all\nkinds of different policies, right?\n\n121\n00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.950\n>> Yeah Sands is pretty good at that.\n\n122\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.260\nThat's one of the things.\n\n123\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.069\nThey're good at a lot of things and\nthis is one of the areas they excel at,\n\n124\n00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:07.193\nis that they do have these things\nvery clearly documented or\n\n125\n00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:10.877\nthey at least have process documents\nto help you go through the process\n\n126\n00:07:10.877 --> 00:07:15.780\nof creating the stuff from scratch, if\nyou've had no guidance on it whatsoever.\n\n127\n00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.710\nBut like I said, there are other ones for\nthe various industries that help you too.\n\n128\n00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.240\nThe government makes available or\n\n129\n00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.330\nwhomever makes available to\nmake things happen for you.\n\n130\n00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.070\nSo you're not just left out in the cold.\n\n131\n00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.770\nAnd the only time I'd say nowadays\nyou're really left out in the cold is if\n\n132\n00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:37.450\nyou're doing something so unusual and\nyou're breaking so much new ground that\n\n133\n00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.170\nthey really don't have a full rule set for\nyou yet, so you may be kind of forging new\n\n134\n00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:48.189\nground and breaking new ground\nthere to get a certain result.\n\n135\n00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:49.315\n>> So what is my motivation?\n\n136\n00:07:49.315 --> 00:07:52.425\nWhy do I really want to sit down and\ndo all this [LAUGH],\n\n137\n00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:55.481\nwhat I like to call\nthe bureaucratic policy stuff?\n\n138\n00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:02.938\nThe motivation in a lot of cases is\nas easy as looking in the mirror and\n\n139\n00:08:02.938 --> 00:08:03.550\nasking yourself,\ndo you want to go to jail.\n\n140\n00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That motivates you.\n\n141\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.980\n>> That's a good one.\n\n142\n00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where do we go?\n\n143\n00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.600\nWhere do we go to make these policies?\n\n144\n00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm ready.\n\n145\n00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.000\nWell, the motivations,\nthey definitely do include that.\n\n146\n00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.840\nIn some cases you have no choice.\n\n147\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.140\nThis will happen.\n\n148\n00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.520\nOr when something else happens as\na result of you not having this policy,\n\n149\n00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.400\nyou're in trouble and\nthey're gonna do something about it.\n\n150\n00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.290\nYou know, that could be the government,\n\n151\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.600\ncould be in the government you\nknow if they do criminal stuff.\n\n152\n00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.716\nOh yeah, you're,\nunder the right conditions,\n\n153\n00:08:37.716 --> 00:08:42.380\nyou're going to get fined\nand/or go to jail for that.\n\n154\n00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.120\nBut if it's not the government, if it's\nnot a criminal case, it could be civil.\n\n155\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.595\nIn which case, if it's civil,\nit means you're getting sued, and\n\n156\n00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:51.775\nthere's monetary penalties for that.\n\n157\n00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:56.825\nNot prison time, so you can get, and\nthen there's regulatory stuff, too.\n\n158\n00:08:56.825 --> 00:08:59.135\nRegulatory stuff can also put you there,\n\n159\n00:08:59.135 --> 00:09:01.735\ntoo, if you do not follow\ncertain guidelines.\n\n160\n00:09:01.735 --> 00:09:02.555\nYou know, for\n\n161\n00:09:02.555 --> 00:09:07.135\nexample, with Sarbanes-Oxley,\nyou have to follow certain guidelines.\n\n162\n00:09:07.135 --> 00:09:10.490\nAnd that pertains to regulated industries.\n\n163\n00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.110\nYou have to, or publicly traded companies,\n\n164\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:16.060\nrather, if people do\nnot sign the documents.\n\n165\n00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.950\nWell, then, those people, if those things\nare found to be bogus later on, and\n\n166\n00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.750\nyour question found out that this was\ngross negligence on your point, or\n\n167\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.480\nsome sort of negligence,\nyou knew it and didn't sign it, or\n\n168\n00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.980\nyou signed it knowing that was in there.\n\n169\n00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.520\nYou can't say, hey, I didn't know that.\n\n170\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.640\nIt's like, well,\nthat looks like your name, doesn't it?\n\n171\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.920\nIt looks like you signed this.\n\n172\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.830\nThat's something that could come\nback to haunt you, so they put\n\n173\n00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.330\nthe government in a lot of countries\nIn a lot of different cases, too,\n\n174\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.050\nput those motivations in place saying,\nwe are now holding you responsible.\n\n175\n00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.070\nSo that became a big motivation, not\njust that you have to have them in place\n\n176\n00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.410\nbecause they say so, but because they're\nholding you responsible for that, too.\n\n177\n00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.810\nAnd so\nthose would be a couple of key ones and\n\n178\n00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.790\nthen other things would be making the\nbusiness work the way it's supposed to,\n\n179\n00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.560\nkeeping the confidence of your customers.\n\n180\n00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.650\nBecause some of these policies would say,\nfor example, in finance,\n\n181\n00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.570\nfor things like charge cards and\nstuff like that, ever notice when you get,\n\n182\n00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.510\nwhen you have like a credit card.\n\n183\n00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.420\nWhen you have a credit card, debit card,\nsomething like that usually well,\n\n184\n00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:28.270\nusually it's a credit card That your\ncredit card company will send you updates,\n\n185\n00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.610\nyou know, every so often.\n\n186\n00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.910\nEven if you're getting\nelectronic statements nowadays,\n\n187\n00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.330\nit will mail you stuff.\n\n188\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.090\nYou'll still see that.\n\n189\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:34.910\nThey'll mail you stuff and\n\n190\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.645\nit says that's a that doesn't\nhave a bill or anything in it.\n\n191\n00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:43.295\nYou open it up and\nit's got a bunch of fine print in it.\n\n192\n00:10:43.295 --> 00:10:47.095\nThey're doing that because that's been\nmandated that they have to do that\n\n193\n00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:47.835\nto inform you.\n\n194\n00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:51.087\nSo, that's become a policy that's\nin place that they make a change.\n\n195\n00:10:51.087 --> 00:10:56.197\nThe policy says they have to send out\ntheir change in policy to you and make it\n\n196\n00:10:56.197 --> 00:11:00.207\nvisible to you, or accessible to you,\nat the very least, what's being changed.\n\n197\n00:11:00.207 --> 00:11:03.337\nSo you can take a look to see\nif you agree with it or not.\n\n198\n00:11:03.337 --> 00:11:04.767\nSo that's been put in play.\n\n199\n00:11:04.767 --> 00:11:08.027\nSo that would be another motivation above\njust, I want to make sure I'm taking care\n\n200\n00:11:08.027 --> 00:11:12.070\nof my customers, I want to make sure\nthey're informed and so on and so forth.\n\n201\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.350\n>> And so there's policies out there that\nas an organization we've got to follow.\n\n202\n00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.422\nMaybe industry policies, governmental\npolicies and things like that.\n\n203\n00:11:19.422 --> 00:11:22.990\nAnd then there's also policies that we\nmight put in place to help, I know you\n\n204\n00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.820\nwere talking about risk management\nearlier, to protect our assets and\n\n205\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.860\nto protect our employees,\nlike acceptable use policies as well.\n\n206\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.630\n>> Yeah there's a lot of\nthem that come into play.\n\n207\n00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.500\nWhen you look at the motivation\npart of it, you want to have these\n\n208\n00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.370\nthings in place because it really,\nreally does protect you.\n\n209\n00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.084\nYou asked about the acceptable use ones.\n\n210\n00:11:45.084 --> 00:11:49.953\nAcceptable use for having that in place,\nthat can be something that\n\n211\n00:11:49.953 --> 00:11:53.530\nif you put an acceptable use in place,\nit's gonna limit what people can do, or\n\n212\n00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:59.820\nat least tell them\nwhat's expected of them.\n\n213\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.120\nAnd that's really the idea, you want to\nlet them know what's expected of them,\n\n214\n00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.912\nas well as to know potential penalties and\ndue process that can be followed.\n\n215\n00:12:07.912 --> 00:12:11.138\nAll those things that are going to\ncome into play if they break that.\n\n216\n00:12:11.138 --> 00:12:15.085\nSo, that 's another big motivation\nto have it in place but\n\n217\n00:12:15.085 --> 00:12:19.850\nalso to make sure that it's established,\nthat they're aware of it.\n\n218\n00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.486\nThat they know what the penalties are,\nthey know what the due process is for it,\n\n219\n00:12:23.486 --> 00:12:25.530\nand that's all gonna be followed.\n\n220\n00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:30.210\n>> Does it make it difficult for a company\nto maybe persecute an employee that\n\n221\n00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.530\nviolated those if those weren't know\nthe the employees in the first place?\n\n222\n00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:37.300\n>> Yes, it can become very tricky,\na very sticky situation,\n\n223\n00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.060\nyou know I could conceivably, no matter\nhow crazy, off the wall it would be,\n\n224\n00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.520\nlet's say I went to a business and\n\n225\n00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.490\nI started I'm working there, and\nthen just after working there for\n\n226\n00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:54.190\na couple of days I start downloading\nhardcore pornography, let's say.\n\n227\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:59.029\nAnd I pick that because it's something\nthat just about under any situation you\n\n228\n00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:04.102\ncan envision, it's gonna be unacceptable\nand I've already downloaded it all.\n\n229\n00:13:04.102 --> 00:13:06.812\nNo, [LAUGH] kidding.\n\n230\n00:13:06.812 --> 00:13:09.481\n>> Sean,\nyou did take a look at our acceptable use\n\n231\n00:13:09.481 --> 00:13:11.682\npolicy before we signed you on right?\n\n232\n00:13:11.682 --> 00:13:14.534\n>> Yeah, but the thing is,\nis that if you were to do that,\n\n233\n00:13:14.534 --> 00:13:18.194\nand like I said I chose the topic\nbecause it's something that really,\n\n234\n00:13:18.194 --> 00:13:21.150\nunder any condition,\nit would be unacceptable.\n\n235\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.280\nSo it would stand to reason that\nif someone, anyone, me, anyone,\n\n236\n00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:25.860\nwent to a place and\n\n237\n00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.370\nstarted downloading it, it's common sense\nthat you shouldn't be doing that, period.\n\n238\n00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.860\nDocumented or not,\nthat's unacceptable to do.\n\n239\n00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.176\nHowever, even though society\nkinda says that hey,\n\n240\n00:13:37.176 --> 00:13:43.470\nthat type of stuff is unacceptable to\nbe doing in those types of situations.\n\n241\n00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.873\nIf you don't document it,\nit's easy enough for\n\n242\n00:13:46.873 --> 00:13:52.020\nsomeone that wants to really kind of\nmess with you and cause you problems.\n\n243\n00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.402\nIs that if I came in and did that and\nyou fired me, if you haven't told me that\n\n244\n00:13:55.402 --> 00:13:58.600\nthat's unacceptable, it is possible,\nunder certain conditions.\n\n245\n00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.660\nWhere I could just hire a lawyer and turn\nback around and say you never told me.\n\n246\n00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.070\nEven though anyone would\nsay are you crazy?\n\n247\n00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.210\nNo one does that.\n\n248\n00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.730\nYou didn't tell me I couldn't.\n\n249\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:11.050\n>> And it seems like that's what\na lot of these policies do, is they\n\n250\n00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:15.900\nput in writing things that we might expect\npeople to know but we can't assume.\n\n251\n00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.750\nOr we can't make that assumption.\n\n252\n00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.500\n>> Yeah.\n\n253\n00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.280\nIf you don't put in there,\nno matter how obvious it is,\n\n254\n00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.320\nsomeone has a loophole\nthey can jump through.\n\n255\n00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:31.470\nThat's why again, I said, joked around\na bit with it but It's really not,\n\n256\n00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.520\nit's really not a joke because\nsomething that seems really obvious,\n\n257\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.630\nthat you shouldn't be doing that.\n\n258\n00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.750\nYou know, business doesn't care if\nyou're accessing that content at home,\n\n259\n00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.130\nthat's your home and\nyou can do whatever you want there.\n\n260\n00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.670\nBut, they're saying you can't do it here,\n\n261\n00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.390\nif you don't tell them\nthey can't do it here.\n\n262\n00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.210\nWhose to say that they can't?\n\n263\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.920\nEven though society says something\nthat's not written in black and\n\n264\n00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.060\nwhite and therefore there's a big wide\nopen door for someone to walk through and\n\n265\n00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.810\nsay you didn't tell me I couldn't.\n\n266\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.080\nAs much as you hate that\nline of reasoning it works.\n\n267\n00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.270\nSo how does liability\nfit into all of this?\n\n268\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.340\n>> What happens is when you put\nthese policies in place and\n\n269\n00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.540\nyou get everything kind of running\nlike a well oiled machine and\n\n270\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.910\nyou've done your job,\nit should be that your liability changes.\n\n271\n00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:26.661\nYour liability starts getting\noffset maybe because you've\n\n272\n00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:31.140\ndone something that business\nreally needs to have done.\n\n273\n00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.626\nSo you put it out there saying, okay,\nwe're gonna do this, this and this, and\n\n274\n00:15:34.626 --> 00:15:38.080\nby doing these things, and following\nthese things, your liability is okay.\n\n275\n00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.280\nWell, they've got it documented,\nthey're following these policies and\n\n276\n00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.820\nprocedures, okay, so we can drop it down.\n\n277\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.822\nEverything's on the level with them.\n\n278\n00:15:44.822 --> 00:15:48.896\nPeople can read that, see that, it looks\nlike you've got your act together.\n\n279\n00:15:48.896 --> 00:15:51.312\nThat's what all that does for you.\n\n280\n00:15:51.312 --> 00:15:53.981\nSo it reduces the liability\nin a lot of cases.\n\n281\n00:15:53.981 --> 00:15:56.206\nIf you're telling that person,\n\n282\n00:15:56.206 --> 00:16:00.417\nit's no longer that they're\ndownloading adult content, but\n\n283\n00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:05.195\ndownloading stuff like illegal software,\nyou put it in that context.\n\n284\n00:16:05.195 --> 00:16:09.030\nBy doing that, by telling them\nif the software's not licensed,\n\n285\n00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:13.286\nthey can't have it, you could make\nwith the aforementioned content and\n\n286\n00:16:13.286 --> 00:16:18.259\nthen saying software, you could say,\nokay, there's two different categories.\n\n287\n00:16:18.259 --> 00:16:20.927\nThey're both unacceptable, but one's,\n\n288\n00:16:20.927 --> 00:16:25.325\nwhile they're both unacceptable to\nthe business, you figure, well,\n\n289\n00:16:25.325 --> 00:16:28.873\nthe software stuff's gonna be\na little less of a problem.\n\n290\n00:16:28.873 --> 00:16:33.634\nWell, you could argue that, but\nas far as it goes, they're kind of on\n\n291\n00:16:33.634 --> 00:16:38.186\nthe same thing, they both open\nthe business to certain problems.\n\n292\n00:16:38.186 --> 00:16:42.015\nThe former one makes it so someone could\nsay they're offended by it and all that,\n\n293\n00:16:42.015 --> 00:16:44.508\nand that's a big liability issue for\nthe business.\n\n294\n00:16:44.508 --> 00:16:48.240\nSo them saying that's not allowed,\nthey can say, you knew about it,\n\n295\n00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.850\nand we're not gonna be\nheld responsible for it.\n\n296\n00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.470\nYou're out, you're fired.\n\n297\n00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.120\nWith the pirated software, or\npeople downloading illegal software and\n\n298\n00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.110\nbringing it into a business, or\ndownload it in the business.\n\n299\n00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.780\nIf the business doesn't put something\nin place saying they're not allowed to\n\n300\n00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:06.090\ndo that, that could also cause a lot\nof problems because it becomes\n\n301\n00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.090\nthe problem of the business again.\n\n302\n00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.989\nIf a business is not taking steps to keep\nsomeone from downloading pirated software,\n\n303\n00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:15.661\nit becomes the business's problem.\n\n304\n00:17:15.661 --> 00:17:18.833\nThe business is the one that will\nhave whoever the lawyers from\n\n305\n00:17:18.833 --> 00:17:22.676\nsome company potentially breathing\ndown their throat and saying, okay,\n\n306\n00:17:22.676 --> 00:17:24.209\nwell guess what you got to do.\n\n307\n00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:27.806\nYou gonna have to buy all this software\neven though you don't use it as\n\n308\n00:17:27.806 --> 00:17:30.535\na practice,\nsomeone was using it in your systems and\n\n309\n00:17:30.535 --> 00:17:33.281\nyou're responsible for\nthem, you're buying it.\n\n310\n00:17:33.281 --> 00:17:37.972\n>> So it's kinda protection for the\ncompany, almost, whereas that individual\n\n311\n00:17:37.972 --> 00:17:42.391\nmight be guilty of doing something\nthat could have legal ramifications.\n\n312\n00:17:42.391 --> 00:17:44.886\nBut if I put a policy in place and\nthey've signed it,\n\n313\n00:17:44.886 --> 00:17:46.645\nthey knew it was against our policy,\n\n314\n00:17:46.645 --> 00:17:50.640\nat least maybe those legal ramifications\ncan't come against the company itself.\n\n315\n00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.520\nIt would be to the individual,\nwhereas if I didn't have that policy,\n\n316\n00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.820\nthey could maybe come after the individual\nas well as come after the company?\n\n317\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.721\n>> Yeah, they could,\n\n318\n00:17:58.721 --> 00:18:01.747\nthese things could actually limit\nthe company's liability a lot.\n\n319\n00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:05.594\nMay not get them totally off the hook,\nbecause you never know,\n\n320\n00:18:05.594 --> 00:18:10.167\nsomeone could say if they were offended\nby either types, by the first one,\n\n321\n00:18:10.167 --> 00:18:14.028\nlet's say, or something happened\nregarding the second one.\n\n322\n00:18:14.028 --> 00:18:18.890\nIn both cases, the company could have some\nliability, but this would limit their\n\n323\n00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.909\nliability on it, because it says that hey,\nthis person knew this,\n\n324\n00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:27.510\nwe told them when they came on board that\nthese were the things that were done.\n\n325\n00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.850\nThey signed off on it,\nthen when updates were released to it,\n\n326\n00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.930\nthey signed off on\nthe updates that came out.\n\n327\n00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:36.502\nSo they knew whether or not they read\nit or not, and that's the thing.\n\n328\n00:18:36.502 --> 00:18:40.930\nSomeone says, well, I didn't see that,\nI didn't read that any place.\n\n329\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.070\nWell, you signed it,\ndoesn't matter if you read or not.\n\n330\n00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.048\nYou saying you agree to it,\nread it or not.\n\n331\n00:18:46.048 --> 00:18:51.489\nSo, that's something that offloads\nsome of that responsibility,\n\n332\n00:18:51.489 --> 00:18:56.570\nif not all of it, from the employer or\nthe organization itself.\n\n333\n00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.368\nSometimes it'll get them completely off\nthe hook, sometimes you won't be as lucky.\n\n334\n00:19:00.368 --> 00:19:04.329\nSometimes you're gonna have\nsome limited liability, but\n\n335\n00:19:04.329 --> 00:19:09.952\nthat's better than just being, hey, this\nperson has just downloaded a whole bunch\n\n336\n00:19:09.952 --> 00:19:15.594\nof illegal software or downloaded a bunch\nof adult content or downloaded whatever.\n\n337\n00:19:15.594 --> 00:19:19.483\nIf you don't have a policy in place,\nyou're responsible for that now,\n\n338\n00:19:19.483 --> 00:19:21.620\nyou are 100% responsible.\n\n339\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.490\n>> And that kinda leads,\n\n340\n00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.510\nit's a great segue right into our\nnext thing we want to talk about.\n\n341\n00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.040\nHow do I know, as a organization,\nif I've done enough?\n\n342\n00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.880\nIs creating that one policy enough?\n\n343\n00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.030\nHave I've done everything that's expected?\n\n344\n00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.433\nAnd that's those terms,\ndue care and due diligence.\n\n345\n00:19:35.433 --> 00:19:38.747\n>> Yeah, you never really get away from\nthose terms when you're talking to be\n\n346\n00:19:38.747 --> 00:19:41.693\nabout being a manager, or\nsomeone that's a high level director,\n\n347\n00:19:41.693 --> 00:19:43.133\ndealing with security issues.\n\n348\n00:19:43.133 --> 00:19:46.651\nBecause you have to make sure due care and\ndue diligence is being followed.\n\n349\n00:19:46.651 --> 00:19:51.421\nFortunately, those terms,\neven though they're legal terms and\n\n350\n00:19:51.421 --> 00:19:56.796\nyou could go on forever and ever and\never how they relate and what they mean.\n\n351\n00:19:56.796 --> 00:19:59.261\nWe can take the easy route on this and\nsay,\n\n352\n00:19:59.261 --> 00:20:03.489\ndue care means are you doing what's\nreasonable to protect yourself and\n\n353\n00:20:03.489 --> 00:20:08.160\ndue diligence in this case means are you\ncontinuing to do what's reasonable?\n\n354\n00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.380\nAre you keeping an eye on it?\n\n355\n00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.972\nIf you can't be shown that\nyou've exercised due care and\n\n356\n00:20:12.972 --> 00:20:15.166\ndue diligence,\nyou're gonna have a problem.\n\n357\n00:20:15.166 --> 00:20:20.670\nFor example, if you've done something and\nyou do not have due care,\n\n358\n00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:25.740\nyou can't show that you've exercised\ndue care, they can nail you to a wall.\n\n359\n00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.720\nA good example would be,\n\n360\n00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.860\nif you didn't install anti-virus\nsoftware on any of your systems.\n\n361\n00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.888\nIt's the one I've always used,\n\n362\n00:20:32.888 --> 00:20:34.880\nyou didn't install antivirus\nsoftware on any of your systems.\n\n363\n00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.875\nIf that ever had to go to court because\nyou got a worm on your system and\n\n364\n00:20:39.875 --> 00:20:43.388\nthat worm started sniping\npeople's personal information and\n\n365\n00:20:43.388 --> 00:20:45.191\nputting it out on the internet.\n\n366\n00:20:45.191 --> 00:20:48.730\nAnd so, those people are suing you,\nand well,\n\n367\n00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.752\nyou didn't have an antivirus on there.\n\n368\n00:20:51.752 --> 00:20:55.467\nNo, no, you pick a scenario where\nnot having antivirus is acceptable.\n\n369\n00:20:55.467 --> 00:20:57.312\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> So, as a company,\n\n370\n00:20:57.312 --> 00:21:02.684\nyou know I wasn't responsible for the\nworm, but because I did nothing to protect\n\n371\n00:21:02.684 --> 00:21:07.595\nmyself against a risk that I surely\nshould have found in my risk analysis.\n\n372\n00:21:07.595 --> 00:21:09.933\nI'm not doing my due care or\nmy due diligence, so\n\n373\n00:21:09.933 --> 00:21:11.730\nnow I can be liable as a company.\n\n374\n00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:16.678\n>> Yeah, it's common sense that you\nshould've had an antivirus on that system,\n\n375\n00:21:16.678 --> 00:21:20.285\nand there's really no other\nexcuse that's gonna hold water.\n\n376\n00:21:20.285 --> 00:21:22.770\nHeck, I\n\n377\n00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:27.340\nthink of it as no matter how much you want\nto think that you are already vulnerable.\n\n378\n00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.310\n>> You need to think of\nthe big picture here,\n\n379\n00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.130\nis are you still doing what's reasonable?\n\n380\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:37.210\nI think of people that, and not to pick\non them, but people that we see or\n\n381\n00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:41.244\nwe see around now and\nthen still that are Apple users going,\n\n382\n00:21:41.244 --> 00:21:43.879\noh, we're never vulnerable to anything,\nwe don't have those problems.\n\n383\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.190\nYou can keep kidding yourself all you want\nand say you're not vulnerable to malware,\n\n384\n00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:49.790\nany of these problems all you want.\n\n385\n00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.740\nYou go in front of a court and\ntry that attitude, watch what happens.\n\n386\n00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.260\nIt's like, we don't get those things,\nthey'll be like [SOUND] okay,\n\n387\n00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.736\nthat's how much you're getting fined.\n\n388\n00:21:56.736 --> 00:22:00.560\nAnd you're out,\nthat's about the end of it.\n\n389\n00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.420\nYou have to exercise what's\nconsidered to be reasonable.\n\n390\n00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.090\nThen the due diligence,\n\n391\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:09.330\nlike I said, are you continuing\nto do that in an ongoing basis?\n\n392\n00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:12.040\nFine, you put an antivirus in the system,\nbut are you updating it?\n\n393\n00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.310\nThat would be something that would do it.\n\n394\n00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:17.120\nAre you continuing to do your threat\nassessment, your risk analysis?\n\n395\n00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.910\nAre you updating those things?\n\n396\n00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.726\nTo make sure that you are still\nwhere you need to be.\n\n397\n00:22:21.726 --> 00:22:25.537\nIf not then, I don't care if you\nexercised due care originally,\n\n398\n00:22:25.537 --> 00:22:28.883\nyou're not exercising due\ndiligence now by verifying.\n\n399\n00:22:28.883 --> 00:22:33.349\nAnd therefore, you're once again backing\nyourself into a corner where you're going\n\n400\n00:22:33.349 --> 00:22:35.010\nto have some serious problems.\n\n401\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.950\n>> These seem like things that\nare not really predefined though,\n\n402\n00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.760\nkind of tough when you say what\na reasonable person would do.\n\n403\n00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.280\nTypically left up to the courts then?\n\n404\n00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:50.678\n>> I wouldn't say left up to the courts,\nI'd say it would be something\n\n405\n00:22:50.678 --> 00:22:55.790\nthat if you were to go to an expert\nin that field, or to look at what\n\n406\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:23:01.403\nother businesses are doing,\nare they still doing that sort of thing?\n\n407\n00:23:01.403 --> 00:23:05.133\nWe could say, well,\nyou know Active Directory and\n\n408\n00:23:05.133 --> 00:23:07.315\ndo server stuff and all that.\n\n409\n00:23:07.315 --> 00:23:10.689\nIf I went to you,\nwith all your years of experience,\n\n410\n00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:13.240\nyou would be considered an expert.\n\n411\n00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.355\nIf I came to you and\nsaid well, this so and\n\n412\n00:23:15.355 --> 00:23:19.110\nso over here didn't set any passwords\non any administrator accounts.\n\n413\n00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.944\nDoes that sound reasonable to you?\n\n414\n00:23:20.944 --> 00:23:22.395\n>> No, not at all.\n\n415\n00:23:22.395 --> 00:23:25.470\n>> Yeah, it wouldn't hold water.\n\n416\n00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.530\nSo the court's gonna appoint you,\nbasically,\n\n417\n00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:33.260\nand could go to you as an expert, or\njust someone not even going to court.\n\n418\n00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.040\nThey're gonna look at you're someone\nthat's got the experience, got\n\n419\n00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.680\nthe knowledge, does all the stuff and you\nwouldn't do it so who else would do that?\n\n420\n00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.550\nIt's just not reasonable.\n\n421\n00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:45.400\n>> All right Sean, well a lot of great\ninformation on policies and procedures.\n\n422\n00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.810\nAnything else you want to throw\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n423\n00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.726\n>> No, I think that just about does it so\nwe're good.\n\n424\n00:23:50.726 --> 00:23:51.235\n>> All right.\n\n425\n00:23:51.235 --> 00:23:53.825\nWell ladies and gentleman, I want to thank\neverybody for tuning in and watching.\n\n426\n00:23:53.825 --> 00:23:55.964\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n427\n00:23:55.964 --> 00:23:56.928\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n428\n00:23:56.928 --> 00:23:58.541\n>>

00:00:12.800\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.690\nAnd with me today is Sean Ariano.\n\n5\n00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.650\nHow are you doing today, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.770\nDoing pretty good how are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.980\nI'm doing fantastic,\n\n8\n00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.400\nwe got another of our CompTV security\npractitioner episodes coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.620\nThis one were going to be looking\nat policies and procedures.\n\n10\n00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.450\nOne of the most exciting parts\nof the whole CompTV series.\n\n11\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.840\nNo, as we've said in previous episodes,\nthis is not our first look at policies and\n\n12\n00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.380\nprocedures, it also\nwon't be our last look.\n\n13\n00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.370\nBut even though it might not be the most\nexciting thing, you know as Sean has told\n\n14\n00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.830\nus very important part of what were going\nto be doing out there in the real world.\n\n15\n00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.200\nAs well as a part of this CompTA\nadvanced security practitioner exam.\n\n16\n00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.130\nSo like it or not,\nlet's get into it, right?\n\n17\n00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.610\nYeah, after that [LAUGH] you know exciting\nintro you know what we need to do we need\n\n18\n00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.920\nto, one of us needs to like juggle or\nsomething during this.\n\n19\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.150\n>> That would make it more exciting.\n\n20\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.066\n>> With like, knives or chainsaws.\n\n21\n00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.710\n>> [LAUGH] So what have we got Sean?\n\n22\n00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.540\nPolicies and procedures,\nsounds like the same thing,\n\n23\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.660\nprobably not the same thing, right?\n\n24\n00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.660\n>> No, it's really not.\n\n25\n00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.950\nWhat we have is, there's different\nterminology going on here.\n\n26\n00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.530\nSo, what we wanna do is go and\nge the terminology, and\n\n27\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.220\nthen put them in the right order, I think,\nis really the best way to accomplish this.\n\n28\n00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.010\nBecause there's really just a lot\n\n29\n00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.960\nof terms thrown around in talking\nabout policies and procedures.\n\n30\n00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.850\nIt's not just cut and\ndry as that as you would expect.\n\n31\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.770\nSo what we're going to do is kind of\ngoing to, like I said, define the terms.\n\n32\n00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.100\nThen we'll kind of put\ntogether the whole hierarchy.\n\n33\n00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.670\nAnd, hopefully, that all together will\nhelp you understand, knowing everything's\n\n34\n00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.010\npurposes, and how it all fits together\nto form something that actually manages\n\n35\n00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.010\ninformation and people, and just all the\nstuff for the organization effectively.\n\n36\n00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.640\nAll right, so\n\n37\n00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.140\nlet's start with policies, since that's\nfirst in a policies and procedures.\n\n38\n00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.129\n>> And we say policy, right?\n\n39\n00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.750\nSo, [LAUGH] what policy is, policy is\ndefinitely your high-level statement.\n\n40\n00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.010\nIt's that mission statement that I was\nmentioning in our previous episode.\n\n41\n00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.440\nIs that it tells you this is\nwhat our stance is on security.\n\n42\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.400\nIf you're playing by the rules and\ndoing everything as the text book says.\n\n43\n00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.390\nWhat you're going to do is that's gonna\nbe something that the executive body,\n\n44\n00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.620\nthe CEO,\nall of those guy are gonna come up with.\n\n45\n00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.860\nBecause they're the ones responsible for\ndoing that.\n\n46\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.590\nThey're also the ones responsible for,\njust like the saying goes,\n\n47\n00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.840\nthe captain's responsible for\nthe ship, it's the same thing here.\n\n48\n00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.000\nThey're the ones in charge of everything,\nso legally they're responsible for\n\n49\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.200\nmaking sure this is getting done.\n\n50\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.990\nAnd why they could delegate it out.\n\n51\n00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.570\nIt's typically handled up at that level.\n\n52\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.920\nAnd it's signed off on,\nabsolutely signed off on that level.\n\n53\n00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.710\nAnd then once it's signed off on,\nthen the process can continue.\n\n54\n00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.660\nBut the thing you need to remember, is\neven though the term policy is used quite\n\n55\n00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.230\nliberally, and that's a problem for\nyou if you're going into the exam, is that\n\n56\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.970\nsince policy's used quite liberally,\nit's something that can mess you up.\n\n57\n00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.670\nYou could say we have a policy for\nthis, we have a policy for that,\n\n58\n00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.270\nwe have a policy for such-and-such,\nor that's against policy.\n\n59\n00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.610\nIt's used a little too much.\n\n60\n00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.180\nAnd why none of those contexts that\nit's used in are necessarily wrong, for\n\n61\n00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.160\nthe exam that's something that's\ngonna trip you up really quickly.\n\n62\n00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.860\nSo what we have is when a policy is,\na policy,\n\n63\n00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.860\nlike I said,\ndoes give you that high-level statement.\n\n64\n00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.810\nIt's a mission statement.\n\n65\n00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.930\nIt gives you something that kinda says,\nhey, this is the direction we wanna go.\n\n66\n00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.590\nBut, it doesn't take care\nof any of the movement.\n\n67\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.710\nIt says we wanna go that way and\nthis is what we're trying to do.\n\n68\n00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.280\nAnd then, hey, it's another aspect,\nanother thing's\n\n69\n00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.530\nresponsibility to turn it into marching\norders and other fine details.\n\n70\n00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.760\n>> I've always heard of the fact that\na policy is a statement of intent.\n\n71\n00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.540\nAnd then the policy is\nimplemented with procedures and\n\n72\n00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.510\nprotocols, but the policy itself\nis just a statement of our intent.\n\n73\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.600\n>> Yes and that's really the thing.\n\n74\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.900\nThat's another great way to put it,\nis that it just tells you, hey, I use this\n\n75\n00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.740\nfor a mission statement and intent\nwould also be the same type of thing.\n\n76\n00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.520\nJust saying that's\nthe direction we want to go in.\n\n77\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.810\nIt's not supposed to worry\nabout the particulars.\n\n78\n00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.450\nNow it could be kind of longer than\njust a traditional mission statement.\n\n79\n00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.780\nI mean don't expect to have those little\n\n80\n00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.290\nnonsense mission statements you see for\norganizations.\n\n81\n00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.235\nI always call them nonsense,\n\n82\n00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:45.040\ncuz people love to have mission statements\nits like, why don't we get work done?\n\n83\n00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.960\nAnd then we'll work on mission statement.\n\n84\n00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.290\nAnd then we'll discuss this for\nthe next six months.\n\n85\n00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.160\nAbsolutely, we'll get a committee and\neverything, yeah, a committee to form\n\n86\n00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.789\nthe committee to form the action group\nto review what we're going to be doing.\n\n87\n00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.430\nSo yeah,\n\n88\n00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.830\npolicy just, it could be more than just\nwhat a simple mission statement could be.\n\n89\n00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.340\nA mission statement typically, when you\nlook at them, it's something very short or\n\n90\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.106\na few lines telling you what\nthings are gonna be done.\n\n91\n00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:12.840\nThis is gonna be I think it would\ndefinitely be more than that, but it's not\n\n92\n00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.910\nsomething that's gonna go on ad nauseum,\nbecause that implies too much detail.\n\n93\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.710\nIt's gonna be a document that\ncould be a couple pages,\n\n94\n00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.490\nthat says this is the motivations,\nthis is just the motivations and\n\n95\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.460\nreasons why we're doing this,\nthis is what our goals are, and\n\n96\n00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.210\nhere's what our just overall intent is.\n\n97\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.630\nOnce that's put together and rubber\nstamped, and signed off on, and blessed,\n\n98\n00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.940\nwhatever you want to call it, then it's\npassed on down the line to actually be\n\n99\n00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.890\ndelegated to someone else, or some other\noffice to be turned into marching orders.\n\n100\n00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.940\nSo then that's where our\nprocedures come into play?\n\n101\n00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.040\nIs that our marching orders?\n\n102\n00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.560\n>> Procedures are part of the process,\nreally when you get down to it.\n\n103\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.390\nYou know, I put procedures in here as one\nof the terms to mention, because we always\n\n104\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.480\nhear policies and procedures being\nmentioned in the same breath.\n\n105\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.690\nAnd while you don't directly go\nfrom a policy to a procedure,\n\n106\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.050\npeople tend to mention them together.\n\n107\n00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.220\nSo I kind of thought it was fair\nto put that in there and say,\n\n108\n00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.140\nokay, let's compare and contrast too.\n\n109\n00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.615\nSo you just don't mush them together and\nand say, okay it's the same thing.\n\n110\n00:06:16.615 --> 00:06:18.830\nCuz they're definitely not.\n\n111\n00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.905\nA procedure is giving you\nIt's given you a little more,\n\n112\n00:06:22.905 --> 00:06:25.725\nwell it's giving a lot more\nactually than what a policy is,\n\n113\n00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:29.005\na policy is as I said a high level\nstatement, a procedure's actually breaking\n\n114\n00:06:29.005 --> 00:06:32.855\nit down to tell you how\nsomething's supposed to be done.\n\n115\n00:06:32.855 --> 00:06:38.442\nOkay, so that is, in essence,\nyour marching orders saying this is,\n\n116\n00:06:38.442 --> 00:06:41.082\nspecifically, what needs\nto be accomplished, and\n\n117\n00:06:41.082 --> 00:06:44.802\nthis is how it will be accomplished,\nas covered in the procedure.\n\n118\n00:06:44.802 --> 00:06:46.920\nSo, you have policy.\n\n119\n00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.700\nAnd then you have procedures\nsitting over as another item,\n\n120\n00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.660\nthat's ultimately gonna be an outgrowth\nof what the original policy was, but\n\n121\n00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.660\nit doesn't go directly to it.\n\n122\n00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.311\nSo, just make sure you know that,\nprocedure's kind of like a cookbook-type\n\n123\n00:07:00.311 --> 00:07:04.710\nthing, it tells you specifically how\nsomething is going to be carried out.\n\n124\n00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:10.700\nI say cookbook, because it's something\nthat I guess most people can relate to.\n\n125\n00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.430\n>> What is a cookbook?\n\n126\n00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.575\n>> Yeah, what is a cookbook?\n\n127\n00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:13.268\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n128\n00:07:13.268 --> 00:07:18.100\nour policy then might say we need\nto back up our servers every night.\n\n129\n00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.980\nMaybe that's our backup policy or\nour data protection policy.\n\n130\n00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.110\nAnd our procedures might be how\nwe go about doing that backup?\n\n131\n00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.200\n>> Yeah,\nthat would be a very good way to put it,\n\n132\n00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.480\nis that tells you specifically\nthese are the steps.\n\n133\n00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.800\nWe have step one, step two, step three.\n\n134\n00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.460\nAnd that's something that\nyou're gonna have to decide\n\n135\n00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.270\njust how in-depth you're\ngonna get within it.\n\n136\n00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.861\nYou could make these procedures so\n\n137\n00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:45.150\ndetailed that you could\ntrain a monkey to do it.\n\n138\n00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:50.010\nOr you could make them a little less\nthan that, so the person who's doing it\n\n139\n00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.510\nis going to be a trained individual that\nknows you know what specifically what\n\n140\n00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.800\nthe implications are, and\ncan make judgement calls if they have to.\n\n141\n00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.520\nBoth have their benefits.\n\n142\n00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.178\nBoth have their drawbacks.\n\n143\n00:08:00.178 --> 00:08:02.190\nBut the thing is still\ngoing to be the same, and\n\n144\n00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.729\nit's going to tell you how\nsomething's going to be done.\n\n145\n00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:07.770\nStep one, step two,\nstep three right on down the line.\n\n146\n00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.741\nOkay, and we might have more than one\npolicy or more than one procedure then.\n\n147\n00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:15.140\nIt sounds like these\naren't single documents.\n\n148\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.950\n>> Ultimately, you'll have\n\n149\n00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.770\nat least a situation where at\nsome point there is a policy.\n\n150\n00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.850\nAnd then they can break it down to\ndifferent departmental and organizational,\n\n151\n00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.555\ndepending on how big the enterprise is.\n\n152\n00:08:27.555 --> 00:08:28.120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n153\n00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.340\n>> But you typically will have more\nthan one, especially enterprises.\n\n154\n00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.350\nAlthough you'll have\nthe one overriding one.\n\n155\n00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.272\nAnd then it will be broken\ndown into one specific to each\n\n156\n00:08:40.272 --> 00:08:44.400\nindividual department or\nwhatever what have you.\n\n157\n00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.980\nYou can see it happening at\nthe federal government level.\n\n158\n00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.530\nYou can imagine, they couldn't have\none clause that covers everything.\n\n159\n00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:56.660\nNow they do have one policy that defined\njust an overall intent to go back to that.\n\n160\n00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.440\nAnd then they have policies\nthat derive from that and\n\n161\n00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.150\ndiscuss the overall intent for\nthat specific segment, but that's it.\n\n162\n00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.080\nThe main one wouldn't cover all of them.\n\n163\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.730\nBut because the way things are structured,\n\n164\n00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.780\nall these agencies may be\nunder one larger umbrella.\n\n165\n00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.490\n>> So I could see us having if we\nwere an international organization,\n\n166\n00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.030\nI might have one policy,\ncompany policy, but\n\n167\n00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.950\nthen, offices in different geographic\nlocations might have different\n\n168\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.800\npolicies based on certain things that\nare allowed or not allowed in that area.\n\n169\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.260\n>> Exactly,\nit would be something like that.\n\n170\n00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.300\nThat specifically calls out stuff\nthat may be just irrelevant\n\n171\n00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.130\nin the other geographies.\n\n172\n00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.670\n>> We have policies and procedures.\n\n173\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.310\nWe've got those down.\n\n174\n00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.640\nThen you've got programs.\n\n175\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:50.630\n>> Programs are really fill that gap\nbetween policies and procedures.\n\n176\n00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:57.730\nWhat's happening is that when you\nget the policy created up top,\n\n177\n00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.870\nwhat happens is that needs to\nbe distilled down and described\n\n178\n00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.320\nin such a way that it can actually get\nto the point where it's a procedure.\n\n179\n00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.320\n>> Okay, you don't just make that jump\nexcept in very small organizations,\n\n180\n00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.470\nyou don't make that jump\nfrom one to the other.\n\n181\n00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:16.840\nSo you have to have a program that says,\nwe're gonna take that policy and\n\n182\n00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.580\nwe're gonna run it through the meat\ngrinder and distill it and\n\n183\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.280\ndecide what that actually means.\n\n184\n00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.660\nThen we are going to delegate that out\nto write the individual procedures,\n\n185\n00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.000\nwhat have you for the individual\nprocesses that need to be covered.\n\n186\n00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.800\nIt's filling that gap between the two.\n\n187\n00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.440\nYou can't go really easily\nfrom policies to a procedure.\n\n188\n00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.400\nAlthough you could, it's not typically\ndone that way, you have a policy and\n\n189\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.500\nthen you have a program.\n\n190\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.170\nThat program is managed\nby someone like a CSO.\n\n191\n00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.630\nThe high level guy and what he'll do is\nhe'll look at that stuff and break it\n\n192\n00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.590\ndown and figure out what that actually\nmeans, and then that will be handed out.\n\n193\n00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.890\nAnd then at some point you're gonna\nget procedures created off of that.\n\n194\n00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.435\nBut its not the only thing created\noff program is not just procedure,\n\n195\n00:11:00.435 --> 00:11:03.720\nbut it's one of the big\nthings that you'll see.\n\n196\n00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.940\n>> So a program might be like\na let's try this out and\n\n197\n00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:14.359\ntest everything out before we turn\nit into an official procedure?\n\n198\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.379\n>> Well, a program, I think of it as,\n\n199\n00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:23.675\nwould be almost like a large project.\n\n200\n00:11:23.675 --> 00:11:27.870\n>> Oh, okay.\n>> It'd probably be more akin to that than\n\n201\n00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:33.340\nit would be to put it any other way, but\nI could see it the other way, too, but\n\n202\n00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:38.360\ntypically, you have a policy and there's\nthe whole program created around it.\n\n203\n00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.570\nThat says how that's gonna be converted\nover or how that's gonna go to the next\n\n204\n00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.760\nlevel beyond that to actually\nbe converted into a procedure.\n\n205\n00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.650\nBecause that policy, like we said,\ncould be quite large,\n\n206\n00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.725\nso they may have to chop it up and\nfigure out who does what.\n\n207\n00:11:51.725 --> 00:11:55.164\nAnd what that actually means,\nthere may be several cycles going between.\n\n208\n00:11:55.164 --> 00:11:58.700\nThe various departments that\nare creating procedures and\n\n209\n00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.140\nthe program office that says ok,\n\n210\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.720\nyeah you're doing this but that's starting\nto cross over with this over here.\n\n211\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.790\nAnd let's make sure we understand\nthat you got this area and\n\n212\n00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.570\nthis is the area where there is crossover,\n\n213\n00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:14.140\nwe'll have to form some group that can\nmake those two kind of mesh together.\n\n214\n00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.455\nOr the program will make sure they\nall mesh together and coordinate.\n\n215\n00:12:17.455 --> 00:12:20.780\nCuz think about it, in the case of\nsomething like instant response.\n\n216\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.830\nInstant response, every department may\nhave it's own response policy, but\n\n217\n00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.020\nthey all have to fit together in case an\nincident crosses over the department lines\n\n218\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.440\nso the program is gonna make\nsure that's managed correctly.\n\n219\n00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.197\nThat everyone can talk and\nis using the same language and all that.\n\n220\n00:12:36.197 --> 00:12:36.880\n>> Oh, Okay.\n\n221\n00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.880\nAnd then I know procedures\npretty much tell us step by step\n\n222\n00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.410\nthis is the way it's going to be done.\n\n223\n00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.350\nBut there's other documents that aren't so\nstrict, right?\n\n224\n00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.810\nAs far as they give us a little\nleeway about how we might do things?\n\n225\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.850\n>> Yeah, and when you look at policies,\nprocedures and\n\n226\n00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.160\nprograms, those are typically\nall considered to be\n\n227\n00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.460\nmandatory things that have to\nhappen at an enterprise level.\n\n228\n00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.965\nYeah, but not all of them are considered\nto be mandatory documents.\n\n229\n00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:06.370\nThey're not every document,\nthe ones we haven't talked about.\n\n230\n00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.360\nAre considered to be mandatory cuz there\nare other ones that are just optional to\n\n231\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:16.130\nget you moving down the path just in\ncase you don't have specific guides or\n\n232\n00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.570\nspecific things thought out already.\n\n233\n00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.520\n>> Mm-hm, and so\nis that where our guidelines fall?\n\n234\n00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.830\n>> Yeah,\nthey definitely would be in that zip code.\n\n235\n00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.340\nIs when you're talking about guidelines,\na guideline is,\n\n236\n00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:36.150\nthe way I cast guidelines is I look at\nthem as a best practices type thing.\n\n237\n00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.180\nWhere they make a suggestion.\n\n238\n00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.930\nA guideline would be relatively\nalong the exact same lines.\n\n239\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:49.330\nAnd say, okay, these are some things that\nyou can use, but you don't have to follow.\n\n240\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.350\nBut you can use them to actually get\nthe result that we're all trying to get.\n\n241\n00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:58.160\nIn fact, you could create your procedure\nand tack on the guidelines with it.\n\n242\n00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.940\nSo someone's implementing that whatever.\n\n243\n00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.620\nThey can look at these things as something\nthat they might want to consider doing,\n\n244\n00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.500\nto assist them.\n\n245\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:10.960\nBut it's not something that has to be\nfollowed 100%, it's not written in stone.\n\n246\n00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:16.660\nSo guidelines do fulfill that role\nto get you to grease the wheels or\n\n247\n00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.110\nget things moving.\n\n248\n00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.490\nA little bit so\nthat's where things jump in with that.\n\n249\n00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:26.540\n>> And then you've got baselines on\nour list of policies and procedures.\n\n250\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.120\n>> Yeah,\na baseline fulfills a very important role.\n\n251\n00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.800\nIf you don't have a baseline.\n\n252\n00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.810\nIt's like with anything\nelse that uses a baseline.\n\n253\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.430\nHow do you know you've accomplished\nwhat you need to accomplish?\n\n254\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.080\nYou don't know.\n\n255\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.490\nYou don't have a goal so\na baseline fulfills that saying,\n\n256\n00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.980\nthis is what our goal is.\n\n257\n00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.860\nYou have to meet this and\n\n258\n00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.950\nif you don't, then well we gotta figure\nout what the remedial action is.\n\n259\n00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.620\nOr may actually be a procedure for that.\n\n260\n00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.470\nIs that you implement a procedure\nto bring a system into compliance,\n\n261\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.450\nit falls out of compliance, or\nit can't comply with the current standard.\n\n262\n00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.590\nWell, then, what happens?\n\n263\n00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:06.260\nThen we'll have a procedure to\npossibly bring that into compliance.\n\n264\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.700\nAnd do what we have to.\n\n265\n00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.980\nAnd if you can't be brought into\ncompliance,then they'll be another\n\n266\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.420\nprocedure that says well,\nit can't be around a compliance, and\n\n267\n00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.390\nwe judge this system to be\na mission critical system.\n\n268\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:24.100\nSo what we're gonna do is we are gonna\ngo over some place else and say okay,\n\n269\n00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:29.540\nwell can we get a grant, an exception for\n\n270\n00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.980\nthis specific asset so\nit can be used in this environment?\n\n271\n00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.190\nThat's something where that comes in.\n\n272\n00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:43.220\nSo it's very important, I also sometimes\nlook at baselines as standards as well,\n\n273\n00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.530\nthat they establish\na certain expected level.\n\n274\n00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.090\nPerformance or configuration,\nwhat have you.\n\n275\n00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.510\nIf you don't meet that then yes,\n\n276\n00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:57.052\nwe have to figure out why you can't\nif we can bring a compliance.\n\n277\n00:15:57.052 --> 00:16:00.551\nAnd then if you can't,\nis it something that's discarded or\n\n278\n00:16:00.551 --> 00:16:05.568\nit's something that system discarded and\ngot rid of or it's granted that exception.\n\n279\n00:16:05.568 --> 00:16:07.385\nAnd as the case may be.\n\n280\n00:16:07.385 --> 00:16:10.659\n>> But based on it,\nit's our minimum almost.\n\n281\n00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:12.958\nYeah you gotta be this tall to ride,\nbasically.\n\n282\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.209\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you don't meet that requirement,\n\n283\n00:16:15.209 --> 00:16:15.998\nthen you're out.\n\n284\n00:16:15.998 --> 00:16:18.370\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\n\n285\n00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.780\nand then you've got business\ndocuments used to support security.\n\n286\n00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.360\nI'm sure there's quite a few of those.\n\n287\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.560\n>> Yes, there's a lot of those, and\n\n288\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.260\nI would say somebody's business\ndocuments are legal documents.\n\n289\n00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.690\nThere's gonna be that.\n\n290\n00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:37.080\nThen there's gonna be mandates from\n\n291\n00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.150\ndifferent people in charge saying\nthat they're supporting this.\n\n292\n00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.910\nThose could be a number\nof things going on there.\n\n293\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.740\nThere also could be things\nthat define stuff like how\n\n294\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.592\nthese things are going to be audited,\nwhat the rules are for setting these up.\n\n295\n00:16:51.592 --> 00:16:56.300\nThere could potentially be a lot of\ndocuments that go into play here.\n\n296\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.850\nThe one that I always think\nabout with something like this,\n\n297\n00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.105\nis what something like HIPAA,\nSarbanes-Oxley,\n\n298\n00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:08.110\nGramm-Leach-Bliley, there's whole bunch of\nother ones that fit into this that could\n\n299\n00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:13.670\nbe bringing it to the table, saying\nthat these things need to be adhered to.\n\n300\n00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:19.240\nI even think of cases where\nyou have another outside\n\n301\n00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.821\nagency that you're interacting with, and\nmay have more of a standing with than you.\n\n302\n00:17:23.821 --> 00:17:28.730\nAnd they may be embedding some standards\non you as well, so their documents and\n\n303\n00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.810\nstuff is gonna be used to kinda support\nand underline everything you're doing too,\n\n304\n00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:37.190\nso there could a number of documents out\nthat are supporting everything you do.\n\n305\n00:17:38.495 --> 00:17:41.471\n>> So a lot of different documents that\nwe really got to be familiar with and\n\n306\n00:17:41.471 --> 00:17:43.370\nit sounds like some of\nthem are very similar.\n\n307\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.510\nSo it's important on that CASP exam\nthat we understand the differences.\n\n308\n00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.751\n>> Yeah, you have to know the nuances and\nlittle minutia between each one of these\n\n309\n00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:54.580\nbecause you're not gonna\nget far without them.\n\n310\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.696\nAnd I'll be the first one to tell ya,\n\n311\n00:17:56.696 --> 00:18:00.659\nit just kinda sucks the amount of\ncross-over there is between them,\n\n312\n00:18:00.659 --> 00:18:04.510\nbecause they get very confusing,\nso you gotta be careful of that.\n\n313\n00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.530\nNow, the thing is, if you take out that\nlast little bit about the business\n\n314\n00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:12.130\ndocuments usually supports security,\nyou can make things a little easier and\n\n315\n00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:16.670\nI would recommend you kind of diagram\nthis out in your mind or you draw it out.\n\n316\n00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.645\nWhat we typically have is we\nhave the policy up top, and\n\n317\n00:18:19.645 --> 00:18:24.140\nwe're not going to worry about these\nbeing divided into smaller policies.\n\n318\n00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.620\nWe have a policy up top, then we\nhave a program underneath that, and\n\n319\n00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:31.070\nthen we'll have procedures\nunderneath that.\n\n320\n00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.130\nThen we'll have things like guidelines and\n\n321\n00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:40.300\nbaselines generated off\nof that program as well.\n\n322\n00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.940\nSo those will be hanging\nout as part of the mix.\n\n323\n00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.850\nSo the question is just how much\nyou're gonna split this thing up and\n\n324\n00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.760\nhow it's gonna be parceled out.\n\n325\n00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.210\nBut remember, we have policies then we\nhave program, then we have procedures.\n\n326\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:59.460\nAnd those procedures will be done in\naccordance with certain baselines and\n\n327\n00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:05.710\nwe'll also be assisted, optionally\nassisted by having our guidelines\n\n328\n00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:10.070\nthat say, hey, these are some things that\nmay help you out and these are some kind\n\n329\n00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:16.070\nof suggestions or best practices that can\nhelp you get to where you need to be.\n\n330\n00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.292\nAs far as where the business documents\nthat are used to support this come in,\n\n331\n00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:23.170\nthey're gonna be a number of them\nthat could either be separate or\n\n332\n00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.630\nbe integrated in.\n\n333\n00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.650\nSome ones that I tend to think of that\ncould be part of this could be stuff with\n\n334\n00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:33.070\nseparate documents on lease privilege,\nthey use another one,\n\n335\n00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.620\nmandatory vacation all the time.\n\n336\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.300\nThere could be a number of these things.\n\n337\n00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.990\nTermination procedures,\norientation procedures, NDAs,\n\n338\n00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:45.560\nthere are going to be a lot of things\nthat come into play, at that point,\n\n339\n00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.390\nas far as in those things could all\nbe built into different processes and\n\n340\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.740\nmultiple times and multiple places.\n\n341\n00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.400\n>> Very good.\n\n342\n00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.720\nAll right well Sean I tell you what,\n\n343\n00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.510\nyou made something that is normally not\nthat exciting, pretty darn exciting.\n\n344\n00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.220\nI learned a lot there.\n\n345\n00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.920\nSo, anything else you wanna throw\nin before we wrap this episode up?\n\n346\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.468\n>> Yeah, I fell asleep 20 minutes ago.\n\n347\n00:20:03.468 --> 00:20:04.356\nJust saying.\n\n348\n00:20:04.356 --> 00:20:07.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well hopefully you viewers out there\n\n349\n00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.410\ndid not fall asleep and\nenjoyed watching this episode.\n\n350\n00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.980\nI know I did.\n\n351\n00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.740\nBut that's gonna do it for this one,\nso wrapping it up, signing off.\n\n352\n00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.540\nFor ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n353\n00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.510\n>>

00:00:15.338\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:16.615\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:17.140\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.730\nHow are you doing?\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.200\nAnother exciting episode coming your way.\n\n8\n00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.860\nWe're continuing on with our CompTIA\nAdvanced Security Practitioner episodes.\n\n9\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.900\nIn this one we're gonna\ncontinue our focus.\n\n10\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.510\nOver the last couple of episodes we've\nlooked at documents and policies and\n\n11\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.500\nprocedures.\n\n12\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.166\nIn this one, Sean,\n\n13\n00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.493\nwe wanna talk about some of the ways\nwe can protect that stuff, right?\n\n14\n00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:38.927\nWhen we talk about documents and\ncontrols used for sensitive information.\n\n15\n00:00:38.927 --> 00:00:42.178\n>> Yeah you're way too excited to be\ntalking about documents and paperwork.\n\n16\n00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:44.390\n>> [LAUGH] Woo!\nI'm psyched, I can't wait.\n\n17\n00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.290\n>> That's too much caffeine, man.\n\n18\n00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.985\n>> [LAUGH] Where my Mountain Dew?\n\n19\n00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:51.143\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's like,\n\n20\n00:00:51.143 --> 00:00:54.146\nwe're talking about paperwork,\nall right nevermind.\n\n21\n00:00:54.146 --> 00:00:57.476\n>> But it is something that we have to\nfocus on unfortunately cuz it's a huge\n\n22\n00:00:57.476 --> 00:00:59.999\npart, right, all that data,\nall that information.\n\n23\n00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:03.668\nI mean companies now,\nwe are data driven organizations.\n\n24\n00:01:03.668 --> 00:01:07.341\nAnd we've gotta protect that information\ncuz it could lead to all kinds of\n\n25\n00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:08.600\nbad things.\n\n26\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.860\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n27\n00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.370\nDocuments, like you said, unfortunately,\nor fortunately, depending on how you\n\n28\n00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.900\nlook at it, is something that\nany organization's gonna have.\n\n29\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.830\nSo a lot of stuff we've been talking about\nhas kinda been assuming all that stuff's\n\n30\n00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.160\nin the digital form.\n\n31\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.504\nBut what about stuff that's\nin the physical form?\n\n32\n00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:30.525\nBecause a lot of places,\nas much as they said,\n\n33\n00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:34.720\nwhat 20, 30 years ago they\nsaid we're gonna go paperless.\n\n34\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.990\nYeah, it hasn't happened yet.\n\n35\n00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.990\nIt's still got a ways before\nit's gonna get there.\n\n36\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.282\nPeople still need to have that printer and\nother stuff even if you do email and\n\n37\n00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:46.063\nall that those-\n>> I honestly think we are going to run\n\n38\n00:01:46.063 --> 00:01:48.705\nout of trees before we get\na full paperless office.\n\n39\n00:01:48.705 --> 00:01:52.247\nAnd by then we'll have synthetic paper\nanyway so it won't matter, I don't know,\n\n40\n00:01:52.247 --> 00:01:52.815\nsomething.\n\n41\n00:01:52.815 --> 00:01:56.072\nYeah, I remember an early job I had,\nway back with a trucking company,\n\n42\n00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:57.830\nthis was decade or more ago.\n\n43\n00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.564\nOh, we're gonna go paperless,\nyeah, no such luck.\n\n44\n00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:01.464\n>> Yeah?\n\n45\n00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:04.354\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what they were saying when I\n\n46\n00:02:04.354 --> 00:02:05.818\nworked at Northrop years ago.\n\n47\n00:02:05.818 --> 00:02:09.324\nThey were saying the same things, like oh,\nwe're going completely paperless.\n\n48\n00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:11.232\nSounds nice, on paper.\n\n49\n00:02:11.232 --> 00:02:15.550\n>> [LAUGH] So\nwhy do we have to secure them I\n\n50\n00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.585\nguess is the first thing we\ngotta make sure we understand.\n\n51\n00:02:18.585 --> 00:02:23.485\n>> Well, from one standpoint you\ngotta control it just like you do\n\n52\n00:02:23.485 --> 00:02:25.620\nany other physical asset.\n\n53\n00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.699\nBecause it really is that.\n\n54\n00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:31.888\nIt's a physical asset that\nsomeone could walk away with.\n\n55\n00:02:31.888 --> 00:02:34.300\nIt could fall into the wrong hands.\n\n56\n00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.750\nThere's all this stuff that\ngoes with it is definitely part\n\n57\n00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.700\nof the paperwork aspect of it,\nso we have that.\n\n58\n00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.120\nBut then we also have\nhow you classify that\n\n59\n00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.530\ninformation as well as what you\ndo at the end of its life cycle.\n\n60\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.810\nSo when it's no longer needed,\nwhat do you do with it?\n\n61\n00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.885\nAnd what's acceptable, and\n\n62\n00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:56.085\nwhat's not acceptable to do with\nit at the end of life cycle.\n\n63\n00:02:56.085 --> 00:02:59.879\nIt's more than just, hey, we print\nsomething out and show it to someone,\n\n64\n00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.910\nput some red lines or whatever on it.\n\n65\n00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.950\nAnd then we're got that and\nwrinkle it up, throw it in the trash,\n\n66\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.790\nand that's the end of it.\n\n67\n00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.060\nThat just doesn't hold weight in\nany sort of serious environment.\n\n68\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.246\nThere's different shades of that, and\nmost environments, as you scale up,\n\n69\n00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:22.510\nthey just generate a mountain of\npaperwork to go with everything.\n\n70\n00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.880\nSo, I'd say heck, even though we're\ntalking about going paperless.\n\n71\n00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.637\nEven if they're going partially paperless,\nwhich is probably the way it's gonna be\n\n72\n00:03:29.637 --> 00:03:31.890\nfor a long time before it\ngoes completely that way.\n\n73\n00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.380\nEven that's saved a lot of\ndocuments being floating around and\n\n74\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.410\nhave to be destroyed and\nhave to be managed.\n\n75\n00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.640\nBut there's still enough of it around that\nit has to be, there's mountains of it and\n\n76\n00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.800\nmountains of it.\n\n77\n00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.330\nIt's unbelievable when you\nlook at some of the processes.\n\n78\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.001\nThat's something I got\nacquainted with really,\n\n79\n00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:55.252\nreally early on in my career\nwhen I was actually at Northrop.\n\n80\n00:03:55.252 --> 00:04:00.730\nIt was right after they had that big,\nquote unquote,\n\n81\n00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.810\nscandal that a wrench was costing\n$1,000 and stuff like that.\n\n82\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.210\nAnd they were auditing all\nthe defense contractors to find out,\n\n83\n00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.740\nare you charging us that much for a hammer\nor wrench and toilet paper and all that.\n\n84\n00:04:16.762 --> 00:04:19.590\nAll the defense contractors, when I got\nthere, they were saying yeah, we know it\n\n85\n00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.720\ndoesn't cost that much, but look at all\nthe paperwork the government requires.\n\n86\n00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.020\nAnd it was a stack like a phone\nbook to get just one hammer.\n\n87\n00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.570\nAnd they said yeah, it's a $30 hammer but\nall this paperwork to acquire that and\n\n88\n00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.290\ngo through the system.\n\n89\n00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.037\nSomeone has to fill that out, someone\nhas to track that and protect it and\n\n90\n00:04:36.037 --> 00:04:37.485\nfile it and, it's crazy.\n\n91\n00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:38.860\nYeah, there's a lot of\nstuff that goes into that.\n\n92\n00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.799\nSo we've cut that down,\nwe've cut a lot of that paperwork down.\n\n93\n00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:47.353\nBut there's still quite a bit\nthat has to be controlled.\n\n94\n00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:51.292\n>> It's something a lot of companies\ndon't really think about, I think more so\n\n95\n00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:52.880\nnowadays than a few years ago.\n\n96\n00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.568\nI remember the first time I walked into,\nit was Progressive Energy down in St.\n\n97\n00:04:57.568 --> 00:04:58.429\nPetersburg.\n\n98\n00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:01.788\nAnd when you went to print a document\nthere, there was a room full of printers\n\n99\n00:05:01.788 --> 00:05:05.695\nand they had those old-school barn doors,\nthose half doors that would open up.\n\n100\n00:05:05.695 --> 00:05:07.945\nYou were not allowed to walk in\nto where those printers were.\n\n101\n00:05:09.255 --> 00:05:12.525\nThere was a person that worked in there\nand they handed you your print job.\n\n102\n00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:17.190\nThere was no chance of you accidentally\npicking up somebody else's print job and\n\n103\n00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.540\nseeing information that you\nweren't authorized to see.\n\n104\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.090\nOr getting access to stuff that you\nweren't supposed to have access to.\n\n105\n00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.900\nAnd it's one of those like,\nhere we're not a high security facility.\n\n106\n00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.640\nI go back to the printer to get my\nprint job, and everybody else's\n\n107\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.910\nstuff is stacked up on top of it, and\nI flip through it looking for my stuff.\n\n108\n00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.040\nBut as we get into these\nmore secure environments,\n\n109\n00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.000\nthose hard copies are a real concern.\n\n110\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.464\n>> Anytime from now on that I'm having\na bad day and I think I got a boring job,\n\n111\n00:05:43.464 --> 00:05:47.653\nI'm gonna think about some dude\nhanding people print jobs in a room.\n\n112\n00:05:47.653 --> 00:05:49.783\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's my thing,\n\n113\n00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:51.398\nmission accomplished today.\n\n114\n00:05:51.398 --> 00:05:53.583\nIt's like, my job's horrible.\n\n115\n00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:55.209\nHere's your print job, all right.\n\n116\n00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:57.043\n>> Maybe you get a lot of donuts and\nMountain Dews though.\n\n117\n00:05:57.043 --> 00:05:59.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hey can you give me my print job first?\n\n118\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.082\nYou might be in the right market for\na lot of favors.\n\n119\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.218\n>> I don't know.\n\n120\n00:06:05.218 --> 00:06:08.950\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nwe got an idea why it's secure.\n\n121\n00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.970\nBecause obviously it's\nsensitive information and\n\n122\n00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.060\nthen sometimes nothing beats a hard copy,\nyou've gotta have it.\n\n123\n00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.210\nBut we do have to think\nabout how we handle that.\n\n124\n00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.760\nBecause I can't put NTFS permissions\non a piece of paper, right?\n\n125\n00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.530\n>> Yeah, you just can't do the same\nstuff we do with the digital assets.\n\n126\n00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.543\nAnd something add on to the whole\nthing about why security with this,\n\n127\n00:06:31.543 --> 00:06:36.450\nremember there's definitely\nlegal requirements for that.\n\n128\n00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.590\nThat you have to control these things.\n\n129\n00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.578\nI mean,\nthe one I think of immediately is HIPAA.\n\n130\n00:06:42.578 --> 00:06:48.080\nHIPAA, everything's gotta be controlled\nand managed in a certain way.\n\n131\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.870\nAnd if it's not, then be prepared to cough\nup some dough if you get audited and\n\n132\n00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.130\nfound out that you're not in compliance,\nso there is that.\n\n133\n00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.770\nAnd I would also look at something\nelse that goes with the discussion of\n\n134\n00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.200\nwhy we have so many physical documents.\n\n135\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.738\nOne of the things that, if you look at the\nreasons why people still need hard copies,\n\n136\n00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:16.289\nyeah, there's that stuff that people need\nto have, that tactile feeling with it.\n\n137\n00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:18.750\nI mean it's the same thing,\nyou heard kinda that griping.\n\n138\n00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.469\nThe last time I heard that big wave\nof griping over getting rid of\n\n139\n00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:26.064\npaper was when the Kindle became.\n\n140\n00:07:26.064 --> 00:07:29.370\nWhen Amazon put out the Kindle, people\nwere like, oh no, I wanna have my book.\n\n141\n00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.592\nThere's nothing like having a book and\nthe smell and the feel of it and all that.\n\n142\n00:07:32.592 --> 00:07:35.310\nThey were making a big deal\nabout romanticizing it.\n\n143\n00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.370\nYou still hear that,\nbut not nearly as much.\n\n144\n00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:43.526\nPeople are like, yeah this is a good idea\nnow, now they've gotten used to that.\n\n145\n00:07:43.526 --> 00:07:45.918\nAnd Amazon, to their credit,\n\n146\n00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:51.904\ngot the technology right where others\nbefore that hadn't been so good at it.\n\n147\n00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:56.370\nThey had to kinda put PDFs in there and\nscale them out.\n\n148\n00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.312\nThere was that, so people still want it.\n\n149\n00:07:58.312 --> 00:08:01.040\nAnd that's probably the biggest thing now.\n\n150\n00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.930\nThe other thing we get that's\na requirement is think about it.\n\n151\n00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.750\nWhat's another really,\nreally big reason that you need to have\n\n152\n00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.560\nsomething printed out that you\njust can't have on a computer?\n\n153\n00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.770\nOr you can.\n\n154\n00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:19.240\nBut people aren't ready for it,\nit's putting signatures on something.\n\n155\n00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:25.450\nSo there's everything from loan documents\nto medical paperwork to what have you,\n\n156\n00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:30.840\nthat you have to sign the traditional way.\n\n157\n00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.660\nNow here in the U.S.\n\n158\n00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:37.150\nand in other places, there's been\nalternatives to that for a while.\n\n159\n00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:43.680\nHere in the U.S., it was It was\nduring the Clinton Administration,\n\n160\n00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.500\nin the late 90s,\nClinton actually signed in something\n\n161\n00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.810\nthat digital signatures\nwere actually binding.\n\n162\n00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:58.030\nSo you could now use a digital\nsignature on a document and\n\n163\n00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.210\nnot have to print it out.\n\n164\n00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:04.460\nIn fact,\nwhen I purchased my house a while back.\n\n165\n00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:09.650\nAll my documents except for the first one\nthat actually captured by signature on it,\n\n166\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.440\neverything else was done digitally.\n\n167\n00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.110\nAll I had to do was just\nsetup an account and\n\n168\n00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.030\npunch a few things in and\njust click on the documents.\n\n169\n00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.880\nAnd all those things our parents\nmay have had to grow through and\n\n170\n00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.960\nsign a big phone book looking thing.\n\n171\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.650\nNow it's just click, click, click,\nclick, click all the way through,\n\n172\n00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.320\nonce you read it and you're done.\n\n173\n00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.780\n>> I bet as technology progresses, because\nthere's still that fear of, now if you get\n\n174\n00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.010\na copy of that signature, you can apply\nit to whatever document you want.\n\n175\n00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.580\nOr maybe once we get into some biometrics,\nthat'll help that.\n\n176\n00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.820\nBut yeah.\nThat's absolutely true.\n\n177\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.960\nYou got to have that paper copy for\na lot of those signatures.\n\n178\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.720\nThey're not going to accept\nthe digital signature.\n\n179\n00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.020\nAnd how do you carry your digital\nsignature around with you anyway?\n\n180\n00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.550\n>> Well, you know,\nthere's been a lot of discussion on that.\n\n181\n00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.700\nWhether it's a fingerprint or\nan eyeball or something like that.\n\n182\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:03.800\nSo there's ways to do it,\nto tie it back to you and bind it to you.\n\n183\n00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:09.972\nIt's more likely gonna be ultimately\nbased around something that's biometric,\n\n184\n00:10:09.972 --> 00:10:14.990\nbut the thing is is that even though\nwe do have the solutions nowadays\n\n185\n00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:19.820\nto do to actually implement digital\nsignatures pretty much universally.\n\n186\n00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.570\nIt could really,\nreally wanted to it's there.\n\n187\n00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:27.740\nThe thing is is that how many places,\neven if you could give someone,\n\n188\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.060\nsay you're gonna use our finger\nprint as our digital signature.\n\n189\n00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.590\nHow many places are actually\nset up to do that.\n\n190\n00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.410\nThat's a lot of infrastructure\nto develop and stuff like that.\n\n191\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.670\nAnd so it'll be a while,\nbut it's creeping in.\n\n192\n00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.980\n>> They've got a store somewhere, and\nthey've gotta be able to be verified.\n\n193\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:47.530\nAlright so let's say now we've gotta\nhave hard copies for certain things.\n\n194\n00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:54.250\nWhat kind of controls do we have available\nsince it's not an electronic form?\n\n195\n00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.690\n>> There's a bunch of controls.\n\n196\n00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.940\nThere's almost like\nan endless series of them.\n\n197\n00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.670\nYou know that we can't\ncover all of them here.\n\n198\n00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.860\nBut there's a lot of\nthings you can employ to\n\n199\n00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.790\nreally control these physical documents.\n\n200\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.140\nYou mentioned one with this\nperson handing out print jobs.\n\n201\n00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.180\nThat would be a way of physically\ncontrolling those documents.\n\n202\n00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.950\nThere's many other ways\non top of that too.\n\n203\n00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.510\nthere's things such as locking\n\n204\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:30.830\nstuff up under simple lock out key.\n\n205\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:31.900\n>> The key.\n\n206\n00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.700\n>> There are those clean desk policies.\n\n207\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.010\nThat fits into this whole thing,\n\n208\n00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.340\nwhere you don't just have you\nknow stuff it all over the place.\n\n209\n00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:45.380\nEspecially when you leave,\nit get filed some place or\n\n210\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:51.765\nstuck into a drawer or something before,\nand you get up and leave.\n\n211\n00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:55.965\nNo, it's never out of your sight nor\nout of your control.\n\n212\n00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.705\nYou know, there is that.\n\n213\n00:11:57.705 --> 00:12:01.815\nThere is also controlling who can\nactually possess those things.\n\n214\n00:12:01.815 --> 00:12:04.870\nThose documents are checked in and\nchecked out.\n\n215\n00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.810\nSo they're accounted for through\ntheir whole life cycle, every minute.\n\n216\n00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.630\nKind of like that chain of custody type\ndeal we talked about in forensics.\n\n217\n00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.710\nSo we absolutely know where\nthat document is, and\n\n218\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.500\nwho was the last one that\nwas in possession of it.\n\n219\n00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.710\nAnd they know are in possession of it.\n\n220\n00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:20.710\nThen we've got a problem.\n\n221\n00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.680\n>> Like those old school manila\nenvelopes with the little tie up top,\n\n222\n00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.880\nwhere you gotta sign it when\nyou take it from somebody?\n\n223\n00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.290\n>> Yes, same sorta deal.\n\n224\n00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:28.940\nYeah.\n\n225\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:34.010\nThey even in some places will take\nthe documents and they'll put it on\n\n226\n00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:39.620\nspecial colored paper that, to the naked\neye, you can read it pretty much fine.\n\n227\n00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:44.670\nBut, if you try to put it on a photo\ncopier and get a picture of it that way,\n\n228\n00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:48.670\nor capture some of it that way,\nit won't capture it.\n\n229\n00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:52.520\nIt would be one color that\nwill wash everything out.\n\n230\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.990\nSo, there's a lot of that.\n\n231\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.840\nUsually, though,\n\n232\n00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.360\nwhen they start implementing stuff such\nas when you know you have like a manual,\n\n233\n00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.600\nor set of paper work that needs to be\ncontrolled, at least signed out, you're\n\n234\n00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.640\ntalking stuff that's really getting to\na high degree of security at that point.\n\n235\n00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.470\nBecause you've got someone that's\nessentially like a librarian.\n\n236\n00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.210\nEveryone at the beginning of the day has\nto sign everything out, and to people,\n\n237\n00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:22.940\nand when they go to lunch, they either\nhave to make sure their office is locked,\n\n238\n00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.240\nor it has to be turned back in,\nand at the end of the day,\n\n239\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.065\nall those things have to be checked\nback in before anyone's released.\n\n240\n00:13:31.065 --> 00:13:32.297\nSo it can [CROSSTALK].\n\n241\n00:13:32.297 --> 00:13:35.275\n>> Patient records, and things like that?\n\n242\n00:13:35.275 --> 00:13:39.695\n>> Patient records,\npossibly might do that in some cases.\n\n243\n00:13:39.695 --> 00:13:41.775\nBut more than likely I'd say no.\n\n244\n00:13:41.775 --> 00:13:43.635\nI'd say it's stuff like.\n\n245\n00:13:43.635 --> 00:13:45.460\n>> Secret formula for Coca-Cola?\n\n246\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.500\nYou know funny enough,\nit could very well be something like that.\n\n247\n00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.910\nI saw it in the software industry when\nI was working with software engineers.\n\n248\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.120\nThe guide that the software\narchitects put out\n\n249\n00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.210\nthat said this is what the next version of\nour software, features they want to have.\n\n250\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.370\nWhen the software engineers\nwere checking that out and\n\n251\n00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.920\nsaying okay well we're the ones that are\ngonna be working on those set of features.\n\n252\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.470\nFeatures implemented\noff that design guide.\n\n253\n00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:14.040\nWell, they just, they had to check out a\nsection of a guide that was given to them.\n\n254\n00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.510\nAnd they were only allowed to see\nthe section of the guide that pertained\n\n255\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.060\nto them.\n\n256\n00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:22.010\nYou know, so not only was it a case of\nhey, you got them, you get a you have\n\n257\n00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.350\nto check it out, but you don't\nget to check out the whole thing.\n\n258\n00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.200\nYou get a small portion.\n\n259\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.280\nEverything else is protected some place.\n\n260\n00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:36.390\nAnd these type of document control stuff\nshows up in some of the oddest places too.\n\n261\n00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:41.230\nI think of, well not necessarily really\nodd, I guess, in the scheme of things.\n\n262\n00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:46.340\nBut one that really kind\nof initially took me\n\n263\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.270\nkind of by surprise was\njust the amount of stuff\n\n264\n00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.770\nthey did in the movie entertainment\nindustry protects scripts.\n\n265\n00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.620\nI mean, those have a tremendous\namount of security on them.\n\n266\n00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.380\nYou can imagine people nowadays can really\ndisseminate information really quickly.\n\n267\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.420\nAnd so scripts are really,\nreally tightly controlled.\n\n268\n00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.560\nThey will only let some people see certain\npages of the script in some situations.\n\n269\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.544\nOn the big movies you are only\nentitled to see certain parts of\n\n270\n00:15:14.544 --> 00:15:17.790\nthe a script that pertained to you,\nand even during auditions,\n\n271\n00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:22.300\nI've heard during auditions to make sure\npeople don't come in with all these other\n\n272\n00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:27.600\npeople that haven't been hired to\nthe movie and aren't under NDA yet\n\n273\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.560\nthey will use stuff\nfrom other productions.\n\n274\n00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.770\nI heard that for, I heard that when\nthey were auditioning people for\n\n275\n00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:39.610\nthe new, when the,\nthe new set of Star Trek movies came out,\n\n276\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:44.120\nthe director of it, J.J.\nAbrams had also done Alias and Lost.\n\n277\n00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.689\nSo what he did is instead of\ngiving him scripts for that,\n\n278\n00:15:46.689 --> 00:15:49.546\nwhich he knew what the script\nwas at that point, he actually.\n\n279\n00:15:49.546 --> 00:15:53.349\nHad scripts from those ones that, from\nthose series that had already been put on\n\n280\n00:15:53.349 --> 00:15:57.090\nthe air, and said here,\nyou're gonna practice reading out of that.\n\n281\n00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.580\nSo they had that type of document control,\nand\n\n282\n00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.060\nit's like you're not even gonna see it,\nor you're not authorized yet.\n\n283\n00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.900\nWhen you're authorized,\nwe'll give it to you, but\n\n284\n00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.940\njust the ones that you're allowed to see.\n\n285\n00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.800\nAnd that's a very common thing there too.\n\n286\n00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.410\nAnd you could use the same thing\nin just about any other area.\n\n287\n00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.370\nSo it's kind of a fascinating thing.\n\n288\n00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:20.750\nAnother type of control I've seen\nwhich is kind of fascinating is where\n\n289\n00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:25.080\nif information's sensitive,\nthey don't mark it as sensitive.\n\n290\n00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.260\nIt sounds kind of like whoa,\nwhoa, whoa hold on.\n\n291\n00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.250\nWhy would you do that?\n\n292\n00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.550\n>> Hide in plain site type of thing?\n\n293\n00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:35.050\n>> It kind of is that deal because,\nfor example,\n\n294\n00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:41.790\nDuring the Cold War and developing some\nof these really top secret air craft.\n\n295\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.340\nThere was a couple cases when they were\ndesigning really, really out there stuff.\n\n296\n00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.882\nWhat they did is they took the blueprints,\nand\n\n297\n00:16:48.882 --> 00:16:52.760\nLockheed is one of the ones that did this,\nbut Skunkworks too.\n\n298\n00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.890\nSkunkworks, if you don't know, they're\nlike their special design bureau inside of\n\n299\n00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.397\nLockheed that's responsible for developing\nstuff like the U-2 and SR-71 and\n\n300\n00:17:01.397 --> 00:17:05.750\na whole host of other really, really,\njust out there and crazy stuff.\n\n301\n00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.470\nThey would take their blueprints and,\nin a lot of cases,\n\n302\n00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:14.120\nthey would say we're not even gonna\nstamp it as being classified.\n\n303\n00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.130\nSo if someone does happen to walk\nout of the building with it and\n\n304\n00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.560\nthey lose it, or whatever.\n\n305\n00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.540\nHey, its not stamped that someone's gonna\nlook at and go whatever and throw it away.\n\n306\n00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.900\nWhereas if its marked as being a secret,\nor classified, or\n\n307\n00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.790\nwhatever someone's gonna be like,\nwhoa hold on.\n\n308\n00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:37.210\nThis is something that, you know, that is\na little more than just a scrap of paper.\n\n309\n00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.940\nAnd Skunkworks is actually a fascinating\nstudy on document control because\n\n310\n00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.850\nat the time they were doing their\nstuff in the 40s, 50s, 60s,\n\n311\n00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.920\nand all the way up to even today.\n\n312\n00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:53.110\nBut when they were doing stuff back then,\nand had all that paperwork going around,\n\n313\n00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.540\ncuz they weren't using computers\nat the time when they started.\n\n314\n00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:01.775\nDocuments were kept for certain teams,\nwhere kept in certain rooms.\n\n315\n00:18:01.775 --> 00:18:05.315\nYou're only allowed to into a certain room\nand the documents, everything you need for\n\n316\n00:18:05.315 --> 00:18:06.670\nyour job was right there.\n\n317\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:11.240\nAnything else,\nyou had no knowledge of whatsoever.\n\n318\n00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.320\nAnd there had to be special, if you needed\na knowledge of other systems design\n\n319\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.050\nyour system then there had to be\na kind of a liaison set up, and\n\n320\n00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:25.180\nspecial permission for meeting to have\na certain selected people come in and\n\n321\n00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.430\nget the briefing in what\nthe other guys were doing so\n\n322\n00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.890\nthey can make those things fit\ntogether and that was about it.\n\n323\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.910\nThe information was controlled that much.\n\n324\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.690\nThat guy would come back and say, okay,\nwell, this is what we're gonna do.\n\n325\n00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.134\nIf you asked, hey why?\n\n326\n00:18:37.134 --> 00:18:39.090\nHe wasn't going to tell you.\n\n327\n00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.080\nIt was really, really tightly controlled.\n\n328\n00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:48.430\nIt was a good study on something on a\nlarge scale of the way they handled stuff.\n\n329\n00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:52.450\nIf you are ever interested in that stuff,\nthere is a good book by Ben Rich.\n\n330\n00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:56.882\nHe is the guy that was the work under\nKelly Johnson who really founded\n\n331\n00:18:56.882 --> 00:18:58.060\nthe Skunkworks.\n\n332\n00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:03.610\nBen Rich talked about his early days and\nall the stuff he went through working\n\n333\n00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:08.130\nwith the U2 and S71 and the F-117 and\nall that, talked about all those things.\n\n334\n00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.400\nIt's actually quite fascinating.\n\n335\n00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.290\nIt's a really good study on when he\ngets into the stuff the way it worked in\n\n336\n00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.006\nthe factory.\n\n337\n00:19:13.006 --> 00:19:17.340\nAbout how [LAUGH] security can work and\nhow it can fail sometimes,\n\n338\n00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.820\nand some of the humorous things\nthat happen as a result of that.\n\n339\n00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.690\n>> So, now we've talked about,\nyou mentioned\n\n340\n00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.840\nearlier I think somebody throwing it away,\nand we didn't mark it as top secret.\n\n341\n00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.342\nSo maybe they think nothing of it,\nand they throw it back in the trash.\n\n342\n00:19:31.342 --> 00:19:33.641\nThere are times that we\nhave to dispose of it.\n\n343\n00:19:33.641 --> 00:19:40.094\nDocuments reach the end of their\nlifetimes, of their usefulness.\n\n344\n00:19:40.094 --> 00:19:41.166\nThere's got to be certain\nprocedures we use for that.\n\n345\n00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:46.700\n>> Not all,\ndispute the idea that trash is trash.\n\n346\n00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.698\nYou throw it in there and that's it.\n\n347\n00:19:48.698 --> 00:19:53.050\nThe most that the average person thinks\nabout when they talk about disposing\n\n348\n00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.926\nof stuff is they think about there's\ngarbage and the recyclables.\n\n349\n00:19:56.926 --> 00:19:59.046\nThat's kind of it [LAUGH].\n\n350\n00:19:59.046 --> 00:20:01.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's it what else do you need?\n\n351\n00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:05.490\nAnd you know, sometimes they\nmaybe separated a little more\n\n352\n00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.634\nthan that in the hippie area\nI live in called California.\n\n353\n00:20:08.634 --> 00:20:10.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That they have, you know,\n\n354\n00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.590\nthe regular stuff, and\nthe recyclables, and green.\n\n355\n00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.840\nThat's about as far as most people go.\n\n356\n00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.355\nThat's not going to cut it for, you know,\nthe stuff that we are talking about here.\n\n357\n00:20:19.355 --> 00:20:23.972\nThere's the stuff that you can just\nthrow away and not worry about.\n\n358\n00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:29.850\nLet's talk about the company picnic,\nunless the company picnic's got a really,\n\n359\n00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.318\nreally good chili recipe or secret sauce.\n\n360\n00:20:32.318 --> 00:20:34.741\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It aren't gonna be classified material,\n\n361\n00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:38.049\nso they'll just go, you can go ahead and\nthrow that right in the trash or\n\n362\n00:20:38.049 --> 00:20:40.991\nyou know what the lunch menu is,\nthat can go right in the trash.\n\n363\n00:20:40.991 --> 00:20:47.474\nBut in other cases, you know you're\ntalking about special design issues,\n\n364\n00:20:47.474 --> 00:20:52.620\npersonnel lists, and timelines,\nand all those things.\n\n365\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.770\nThose things just cannot be\ndisposed of in most cases.\n\n366\n00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.640\nThose things have to be\ndisposed of a certain way.\n\n367\n00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.190\nThey either have to be shredded\neither on site or off site.\n\n368\n00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.290\nIn some cases they have to\nbe specifically incinerated.\n\n369\n00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:08.180\nThere's very specific guidelines for\nhow those things have to be handled.\n\n370\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:13.040\nAnd if they're not, you better\nhave a really good reason for it,\n\n371\n00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.630\nand there's not many.\n\n372\n00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:20.490\nAnd if you haven't disposed off the right\nway and they find out, be prepared for\n\n373\n00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:25.690\nsome pretty serious consequences to that.\n\n374\n00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:32.270\nThey had, just as an example of this,\nin California area I live in now.\n\n375\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:36.212\nThey had a, I don't know if it\nwas a dentist or doctor, but\n\n376\n00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:38.880\nit was a medical office, regardless.\n\n377\n00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.932\nBut they had someone over the weekend,\nit was like on a Saturday,\n\n378\n00:21:42.932 --> 00:21:46.560\nthat was walking by this office,\njust walking their dog.\n\n379\n00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.700\nAnd everything's just all deserted and\neverything.\n\n380\n00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.410\nIt's also deserted because it's\nThanksgiving weekend too, so\n\n381\n00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.360\nthis person is out there on\na Saturday walking their dog.\n\n382\n00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.290\nAnd they see some computer printouts\njust flopping out of the ends,\n\n383\n00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.580\npaper is flopping out\nof those big dumpsters.\n\n384\n00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:06.100\nAnd so a person, trying to be a good\ncitizen, thinks the stuff's going to blow\n\n385\n00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.300\naway, so they go over to pick it up and\nput it back in.\n\n386\n00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.530\nWhen they pick up this paper to\nthrow it back in, they look and\n\n387\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.710\nthe whole thing is full of paper.\n\n388\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:17.410\nAnd the guy starts noticing there's names,\nand numbers, and everything on it, and\n\n389\n00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:22.050\nhe's like well that's, what the heck is\nthis opens it up its patient records.\n\n390\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:27.283\nIt was quite obvious that that\noffice had thrown this stuff in,\n\n391\n00:22:27.283 --> 00:22:30.649\nand so this guy made a call to the police.\n\n392\n00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:36.120\nAnd they came in and just grabbed\nall the stuff and confiscated it.\n\n393\n00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:42.480\nAnd that office got some pretty serious,\nit's pretty serious trouble for that.\n\n394\n00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.872\nThe scary thing about that is that\nnot only did they do that, but\n\n395\n00:22:45.872 --> 00:22:49.906\nthink about if you're in, I don't know\nif everyone's here in the US, but\n\n396\n00:22:49.906 --> 00:22:54.283\nin the US when you have the Thanksgiving\nweekend, that's a four-day weekend.\n\n397\n00:22:54.283 --> 00:22:59.192\nSo the last day that they could of\ntheoretically been there in that office\n\n398\n00:22:59.192 --> 00:23:02.020\nwas, you know, on Wednesday some time.\n\n399\n00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:08.420\nSo, you figure on Wednesday, they were\nthere, if they went 'till five o'clock.\n\n400\n00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.080\nThey toss this out during their work and\nthey left.\n\n401\n00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.080\nThat's, over two days those things were\nsitting out there before that guy found\n\n402\n00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.310\nit, so who else did it?\n\n403\n00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.090\nDId anyone else grab a few records for\nthe road?\n\n404\n00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:25.610\nYou don't know, so\nthat's kind of a frightening thing.\n\n405\n00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:28.090\nAnd they're not the only\nones that have done it.\n\n406\n00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:32.840\nThere's been cases of people going behind\ncellphone stores and stuff like that and\n\n407\n00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.250\nseeing that someone accidentally\nprinted out the accounts with\n\n408\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.690\neveryone's information on it and says,\noops and just threw it in the trash.\n\n409\n00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:40.720\n>> Yeah.\nPeople don't think about.\n\n410\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.235\nLike you say, if it goes in the trash,\nit's gone, out of sight, out of mind.\n\n411\n00:23:44.235 --> 00:23:47.420\nBut, we know from other security\nshows that That Shawn and\n\n412\n00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.895\nI have done,\nthat good old dumpster diving.\n\n413\n00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:52.567\nPeople will go through the garbage\nif they think there's valuable\n\n414\n00:23:52.567 --> 00:23:53.990\ninformation in there.\n\n415\n00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.940\nAnd it's too easy.\n\n416\n00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:58.040\nPeople throw away all kinds of stuff that\n\n417\n00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.560\nthey just don't think about as\nit being sensitive information.\n\n418\n00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.000\n>> Yeah, it's trash, it's trash.\n\n419\n00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.940\nBoom, they throw it in there.\n\n420\n00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.840\nBut, yeah, absolutely a good point\nto bring up is dumpster diving is,\n\n421\n00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.970\nit sounds old school and\nwho would do that?\n\n422\n00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:18.240\nA lot of people do that, that happens\nfar more than you think it does.\n\n423\n00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.720\nI've seen how often,\npersonally seen how often it happens.\n\n424\n00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.990\nSome things even lead\nthemselves better to it.\n\n425\n00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:31.870\nPlaces I've seen use those\nclear plastic trash bags,\n\n426\n00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.760\nI've noticed that places that use that\n\n427\n00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.600\nseem to get hit a little more often too\nby dumpster diving because it's easy.\n\n428\n00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.550\nYou can pick it up and go, oh,\nthere's some stuff in here, and\n\n429\n00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.710\nthrow it in the back of a truck.\n\n430\n00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:45.290\nWhereas if you've got one of\nthose big black trash bags,\n\n431\n00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.530\nsomeone has to open that up.\n\n432\n00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.230\nYou have to take the thing and throw\nit in the back of the car or truck and\n\n433\n00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:54.060\ndrive off, or\nthey're gonna have to open it there.\n\n434\n00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.570\nThey may very well open it there,\nand that's gonna slow them down.\n\n435\n00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.460\nMaybe they're gonna get caught or\nmaybe they're just gonna say,\n\n436\n00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.310\nthis is not something I\nwanna get tangled up in.\n\n437\n00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.340\nI'll go someplace else.\n\n438\n00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.650\nSo you've got to think about\nthose types of things.\n\n439\n00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:09.800\nPeople a lot of people\ngo through dumpsters,\n\n440\n00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.425\nnot just looking for information.\n\n441\n00:25:11.425 --> 00:25:17.270\nThey'll go there looking for\nother stuff and they stumble upon that.\n\n442\n00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.390\nI've heard people where I used to live\nthey went through Body Glove, you know\n\n443\n00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:24.248\nthose people that make the wet suits, now\nBody Glove's headquarters was right there.\n\n444\n00:25:24.248 --> 00:25:28.740\nAnd Body Glove had to actually start\nlocking their dumpsters, because people\n\n445\n00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:34.040\nwere going in there and they were looking\nfor the neoprint to make their own stuff.\n\n446\n00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.550\nBut, they were saying, hey, we don't\nhave a special trash can, at the time,\n\n447\n00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:38.600\nto throw that stuff out.\n\n448\n00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.030\nSo, we're just gonna lock everything up,\nbecause we don't want the safety issues.\n\n449\n00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.180\nWe don't want these other issues in\nthere so they had to lock that stuff up,\n\n450\n00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.640\nbut people were going in there,\n\n451\n00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.200\ndigging through these things,\nlooking through this stuff.\n\n452\n00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.050\nThey could of found something else.\n\n453\n00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.662\nWhile they were in there looking for\ntheir little scraps,\n\n454\n00:25:53.662 --> 00:25:57.513\nthey could have run across company reports\nor financial stuff or anything like that.\n\n455\n00:25:57.513 --> 00:25:58.904\n>> Yeah.\nAnd granted,\n\n456\n00:25:58.904 --> 00:26:03.149\nthat was a slightly different era\nbefore people really started,\n\n457\n00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:06.560\npaying attention to it in\ngeneral as much as they do.\n\n458\n00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:12.600\nAt that point in time, having someone\nwho had a paper shredder at home was,\n\n459\n00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.450\nthat person was kind of crazy.\n\n460\n00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:17.110\nYou look at them going, okay,\nyeah you are that important.\n\n461\n00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:22.040\nNowadays, it's pretty\nmuch everybody got one.\n\n462\n00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.090\nSo you just [LAUGH] the times\nhave changed since then.\n\n463\n00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.830\nWe've begun to realize that\nthese disposal methods, even for\n\n464\n00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:32.860\npersonal stuff at home,\nhas become much more of an issue.\n\n465\n00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.600\nWe can't just throw stuff away at home,\ncuz people will look.\n\n466\n00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:42.780\nBut the way things have changed,\nwe still have the same problems.\n\n467\n00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:47.650\nYou look at a corporate level, one of the\nissues we have as far as disposal goes is\n\n468\n00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:48.780\nyou got to train people for that.\n\n469\n00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.770\nYou know how hard it is to train someone\nto throw away trash the right way?\n\n470\n00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.680\nThey're like, I've been doing this\nmy whole life, I'm an expert at it.\n\n471\n00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.780\nWe gotta retrain you.\n\n472\n00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:00.420\n>> That's the tricky part, we have a\nsecure trash can here, it's got a slot in\n\n473\n00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.490\nit, and anything that has customer\ninformation is supposed to go in there.\n\n474\n00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:06.670\nBut out of habit some people, they're on\nthe phone they just crumple something up\n\n475\n00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:07.620\nand they throw it in their trash can.\n\n476\n00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.360\nThey don't get up and\nwalk over to that secure trash can.\n\n477\n00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.750\nSo definitely training is a huge part.\n\n478\n00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:17.630\n>> Yeah, and you'll find ways to deal\nwith that as far as disposal goes.\n\n479\n00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.120\nThere's different ways.\n\n480\n00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.202\nI haven't seen specifically how\nyou have it set up here but\n\n481\n00:27:25.202 --> 00:27:30.489\nI know, for example,\nwhen I work with the DOD and do that side\n\n482\n00:27:30.489 --> 00:27:36.839\nof things they will have signs above\nthe copy machines and trash though.\n\n483\n00:27:36.839 --> 00:27:41.447\nThey are not only telling you in training\nsomeplace don't throw your stuff here if\n\n484\n00:27:41.447 --> 00:27:46.320\nit's sensitive, throw it over there and\nit will get incinerated someplace.\n\n485\n00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.960\nThey're actually saying, sign right\nthere when you get ready to throw it in.\n\n486\n00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.760\nIt's on the trashcan,\n\n487\n00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.280\nit's behind the trashcan-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n488\n00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.790\n>> Trashcan's got some little mark\n\n489\n00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.110\nwith be set in so\nthe signs everything will line up.\n\n490\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.100\nThey're not messing around because they're\ntrying to make sure you understand that.\n\n491\n00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.990\nNot only have we told you to do this,\nthere's a visible warning right there.\n\n492\n00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.770\nDon't do that.\n\n493\n00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:09.140\nSo hopefully those things, don't occur.\n\n494\n00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.370\n>> The thing I found, the best way to\ntrain people on that kind of stuff,\n\n495\n00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:14.990\nis everyone got a regular trash can,\nyou put one of those trash\n\n496\n00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.890\ncans cuz when it comes down to it,\na lot of times it's convenience.\n\n497\n00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.940\nI know I'm supposed to throw this\nin that special trash can but\n\n498\n00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.460\nit's at the other end of the office.\n\n499\n00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.970\nI'm just gonna crumple it up and\nthrow it away right here.\n\n500\n00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.625\nPut more than one out and\nmaybe you'll have some luck with that.\n\n501\n00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:28.287\n>> Yeah.\n\n502\n00:28:28.287 --> 00:28:28.833\n>> All right.\n\n503\n00:28:28.833 --> 00:28:33.420\nSo a lot of great information on making\nsure that we can keep our documents safe.\n\n504\n00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.716\nAnything else we want to throw in for\nthis episode?\n\n505\n00:28:35.716 --> 00:28:41.288\n>> I think that probably covers\nthe topic of paper documents and\n\n506\n00:28:41.288 --> 00:28:43.700\nthe physical documents.\n\n507\n00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.570\nI would think everyone's kind of got the\nidea in here that there's a lot of things\n\n508\n00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:48.370\nyou do have to consider.\n\n509\n00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:52.330\nIt's not just print it out and\ntake care of it and throw it away.\n\n510\n00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.230\nThere's more involved there.\n\n511\n00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.021\nSo do check what your regulations are, and\n\n512\n00:28:57.021 --> 00:29:01.452\nwhat different types of rules apply\nto you, and take it from there.\n\n513\n00:29:01.452 --> 00:29:02.113\n>> Very good.\n\n514\n00:29:02.113 --> 00:29:05.170\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n515\n00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.480\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n516\n00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.700\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n517\n00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.750\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n518\n00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:10.348\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n519\n00:29:10.348 --> 00:29:16.570\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:13.938\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:13.938 --> 00:00:16.410\nWith me today is Mr.\nSean Oriyano, how you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.460\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.350\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.030\n>> Fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.642\nAnother exciting episode\ncoming your way on our\n\n9\n00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:23.480\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner\nseries.\n\n10\n00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.776\nIn this one we're gonna talk a little bit\nmore about documents and, specifically,\n\n11\n00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:32.092\npersonally identifiable information,\nI guess more than just documents, right.\n\n12\n00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:35.520\n>> Yeah, to be really sure\nwe're being correct with it,\n\n13\n00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.078\nit's classification of information.\n\n14\n00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:42.900\nIt could be a physical document,\nbut it could be digital too.\n\n15\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.893\nIt's just something that pertains\nto a specific type of information.\n\n16\n00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:52.950\nOne of the things we're saying all along\nis, not all information is created equal,\n\n17\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.110\nit's not just this big sea of ones and\nzeros, or whatever, sitting out there.\n\n18\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.150\nThere is different types of it, so\n\n19\n00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.570\nthis is an example of one of those\ndifferent types that it does merit that\n\n20\n00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.430\nextra special attention that we may not\ngive to some other types of information.\n\n21\n00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.015\nOr not in the same way at the very least.\n\n22\n00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:12.779\n>> So is there a strict definition for it?\n\n23\n00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:15.968\nI mean, when I think of personally\nidentifiable information,\n\n24\n00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:19.400\nanything that could identify\na particular individual.\n\n25\n00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.160\n>> Yeah that's pretty much it.\n\n26\n00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.668\n>> Okay, it could be a driver's license-\n>> All right, end of episode.\n\n27\n00:01:22.668 --> 00:01:23.714\n>> Yeah, right?\n\n28\n00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:28.453\n[LAUGH] It could be a driver's\nlicense number, a license plate tag,\n\n29\n00:01:28.453 --> 00:01:32.706\na Social Security number,\na tax ID number, a fingerprint.\n\n30\n00:01:32.706 --> 00:01:40.820\n>> Yeah, any of those would be something\nthat is gonna fall in that category.\n\n31\n00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.410\nAnything that I could get possession\nof in some way, shape, or form,\n\n32\n00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.950\ntie it back to a person either\nindirectly or directly.\n\n33\n00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.920\nUsually when we're talking about PII\nit's a direct tie-back to someone.\n\n34\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.968\nI can see the name, address,\nSocial Security number, what have you.\n\n35\n00:01:58.968 --> 00:02:02.054\nThere's enough there that I\nknow specifically who it is.\n\n36\n00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.199\nAnd so when you look at it in that way,\n\n37\n00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:07.890\nyou really have a lot of things\nthat fit under that definition.\n\n38\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.840\nAll the stuff that you mentioned,\nyou could take out some of that and\n\n39\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.090\nstill have enough where you can\ntie it back to an individual.\n\n40\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.152\nAnd so that's why it makes it a much\nmore sensitive type of information.\n\n41\n00:02:19.152 --> 00:02:24.015\nBecause you're talking really,\nreally serious privacy issues there.\n\n42\n00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:28.470\nIf that information's compromised, and\ndepending on what is compromised, you\n\n43\n00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.690\ncould be talking a very serious problem\nfor that individual, at the very least.\n\n44\n00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.530\nSo, I mean you look at stuff like\nwhat happens if someone's name and\n\n45\n00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.490\nSocial Security number gets compromised.\n\n46\n00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.110\nThat's gonna be a long hard road for\n\n47\n00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.430\nthem to get out of if it\nfalls in the wrong hands.\n\n48\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.215\nCuz someone could, with that information,\n\n49\n00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:54.060\nthey've pretty much got enough\nto do identity theft on you.\n\n50\n00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.437\nAnd so start opening accounts and\ndo that stuff, and\n\n51\n00:02:57.437 --> 00:03:00.441\nthat can take a long time\nto clean up that mess.\n\n52\n00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:04.456\n>> Yeah, especially here in the US,\nwe know how our wonderful credit bureau\n\n53\n00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:09.148\nhandles that kind of stuff and how helpful\nthey are when something like that happens.\n\n54\n00:03:09.148 --> 00:03:10.147\nBut that's for another episode.\n\n55\n00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:15.062\n[LAUGH] One other thing is, the personally\n\n56\n00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:20.830\nidentifiable information,\nwe know what it is.\n\n57\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.460\nAnd see like today with\nthe companies we all deal with it.\n\n58\n00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.810\nIt used to be that, if you were\nhealthcare, yes, you've got PII,\n\n59\n00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.150\nif you're a lawyer or a bank,\nyou're dealing with that kind of stuff.\n\n60\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.979\nBut nowadays with e-commerce and all of\nthis, it seems like a good majority of\n\n61\n00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:40.112\nthe companies have to deal with some sort\nof personally identifiable information.\n\n62\n00:03:40.112 --> 00:03:42.600\n>> Yeah, they do have to deal with it.\n\n63\n00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.964\nNow some of it, quite frankly, might\nfall under just regular privacy laws and\n\n64\n00:03:47.964 --> 00:03:49.302\nguidelines.\n\n65\n00:03:49.302 --> 00:03:53.550\nBut under certain conditions it'll be\nbumped up to that classification and\n\n66\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.390\nbe personally identifiable.\n\n67\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.900\nIf it's just something that has maybe\nsomeone's name and email address,\n\n68\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.210\nthat's probably a privacy thing.\n\n69\n00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.540\nIt's personally identifies you but\nit's probably not as big of an issue if\n\n70\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.140\nyou got it-\n>> Cuz\n\n71\n00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.838\nyour email address is\ntypically a public thing.\n\n72\n00:04:06.838 --> 00:04:09.764\n>> Yeah, and\nthrow a phone number in there,\n\n73\n00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:13.874\nprobably still not enough to\nkinda meet that definition.\n\n74\n00:04:13.874 --> 00:04:19.674\nBut if you start putting in address, then\ndefinitely put a Social Security number,\n\n75\n00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:24.760\nstuff like that, it's way over\nthe line into being PII at that point.\n\n76\n00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.870\nSo it requires an extra level of control.\n\n77\n00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.990\nAnd it's one of those things that,\n\n78\n00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.680\nif you're collecting any sort\nof information first of all.\n\n79\n00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.690\nIf you're in a position where your\norganization is gathering information\n\n80\n00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.110\nfrom your customers, then you really need\nto be thinking about, at the very least,\n\n81\n00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.740\nprivacy, how you're gonna\nkeep that stuff protected.\n\n82\n00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.120\nThen the next thing is, what's the nature\nof the information you're collecting.\n\n83\n00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.440\nAnd then that's gonna say okay well,\nis that just information that needs to be\n\n84\n00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.590\nkept private because of normal,\nsensible guidelines?\n\n85\n00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.720\nOr if it needs to be kept private\nbecause it's personally identifiable and\n\n86\n00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.058\ncan lead to identity theft and\nis a pretty serious thing.\n\n87\n00:05:03.058 --> 00:05:06.019\nAnd, like I said,\nthere's a lot places that deal with it,\n\n88\n00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:07.450\nwould fit that definition.\n\n89\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.040\nAnd there is some confusion with it,\nwhat's PII and what's not.\n\n90\n00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.220\nAnd I think in some cases actually,\n\n91\n00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.775\nthat confusion is what\nleads to an actual breach.\n\n92\n00:05:15.775 --> 00:05:19.860\nCuz someone doesn't understand\nthat what they're possessing and\n\n93\n00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.890\nwhat they're maintaining is more\nthan just a piece of information.\n\n94\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.470\nIt is something that could\nreally mess someone's life over,\n\n95\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.390\nor cause a big impact on them if\nthat fell into the wrong hands.\n\n96\n00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.880\nSo you've really got to\ntake it quite seriously.\n\n97\n00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.709\nAnd I'd even also throw into this is,\n\n98\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.690\nit's a big issue from the standpoint\nof not just the company, but\n\n99\n00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.600\nalso from a security awareness side from\nthe employee and individual themself.\n\n100\n00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.520\nI say employee and individual,\nit sounds like I'm being redundant there.\n\n101\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.375\nBut there's the employee,\nsomeone who works for a company,\n\n102\n00:05:57.375 --> 00:06:00.330\nthey've got certain issues and\nresponsibilities they have.\n\n103\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.360\nBut then there's the one that you\nyourself have, as a private citizen,\n\n104\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.800\njust being yourself.\n\n105\n00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.398\nAnd people themselves don't even\nunderstand really 100% what personal\n\n106\n00:06:09.398 --> 00:06:11.314\nidentifiable information is.\n\n107\n00:06:11.314 --> 00:06:14.719\nThat's not something that's been\nembedded on them enough to really\n\n108\n00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:18.160\nunderstand that they need to\nkeep that stuff protected.\n\n109\n00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.130\nYou see people that still do\nmismanage their documents,\n\n110\n00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.218\nwhat we just talked about,\nthat contain that.\n\n111\n00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:30.620\nYou see people throwing their individual\ndocuments in the trash at home, and\n\n112\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.330\nthey roll their trash can out to\nthe curb or whatever, drag it out there.\n\n113\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.300\nAnd they figure oh a truck comes by and\nthat's it.\n\n114\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.030\nPeople are becoming more aware that they\njust can't throw paperwork in the trash,\n\n115\n00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.910\nbut in general it's just hey,\n\n116\n00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.010\njust don't throw stuff in there\ncuz someone could use it.\n\n117\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.290\nIt's not the concept of, is there PII in\nthere that could be tied back to you?\n\n118\n00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.470\nPeople aren't thinking in those terms.\n\n119\n00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.010\nSo there definitely has to be\nmore training done in that.\n\n120\n00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:05.658\nBut I even throw in stuff like,\nanother thing with mismanaging\n\n121\n00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:10.677\ndocuments, anyone watching\nthis can ask themselves.\n\n122\n00:07:10.677 --> 00:07:15.420\nWe don't need to know what the answer is,\nit's just a kind of a quick thing here.\n\n123\n00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.660\nJust ask yourself,\nhow many people do you know that\n\n124\n00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.470\nIn their wallet they actually\ncarry their Social Security card.\n\n125\n00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.820\n>> I will tell you that I used to.\n\n126\n00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.000\nWay back when I was growing up\nthat was something you did,\n\n127\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.880\nbut nowadays absolutely not.\n\n128\n00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.364\n>> Yeah, how long's it been\nsince you carried it in?\n\n129\n00:07:32.364 --> 00:07:33.431\n>> Yeah, 20 years, more.\n\n130\n00:07:33.431 --> 00:07:38.090\n>> Yeah, the thought process has changed.\n\n131\n00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:43.265\n>> I never did and I can't say it was\n\n132\n00:07:43.265 --> 00:07:48.827\nalways because I was always really\n\n133\n00:07:48.827 --> 00:07:53.634\nsecurity conscious with it.\n\n134\n00:07:53.634 --> 00:07:58.588\nNo, when I was a lot younger,\nI didn't carry my wallet because\n\n135\n00:07:58.588 --> 00:08:02.900\nI just didn't want a wallet\nwith a thick profile on it.\n\n136\n00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.050\nSo I would just take whatever\nI could out of it, and\n\n137\n00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.230\nit's a habit I still have to this day.\n\n138\n00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.690\nSo I have kind of this decision\nof what I'm gonna put in there.\n\n139\n00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.930\nAnd I have very little, and\n\n140\n00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.630\nthat was one of the things\nthat got locked up someplace.\n\n141\n00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.410\nAnd I'm like I'll put that over there.\n\n142\n00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.540\nBut people still do that a lot,\nand they don't understand that you\n\n143\n00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.180\nlose that wallet, and\nsomeone's got enough, with that ID and\n\n144\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.755\nthat Social Security number,\nthey got what they need right there.\n\n145\n00:08:27.755 --> 00:08:29.905\nThat's two things they need\nto get to impersonate you.\n\n146\n00:08:29.905 --> 00:08:33.055\nThey've got you dead to\nrights at that point.\n\n147\n00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:36.725\nSo all the other stuff about credit cards,\njamming you wallet in cash,\n\n148\n00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:42.305\nthat's the bush league stuff that the\naverage criminal is going to go in there,\n\n149\n00:08:42.305 --> 00:08:45.535\nthey look and, oh I'm going to pull\ncash out and chuck that in the trash, or\n\n150\n00:08:45.535 --> 00:08:49.720\nI'm going to take credit cards and have\na little spending spree with it yeah and\n\n151\n00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.200\nsomeone that knows what they can do\nwith that social security card and\n\n152\n00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.720\na driver's license.\n\n153\n00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.620\nThat's a much bigger thing, but\npeople don't think about that.\n\n154\n00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.770\nAnd then you have people,\n\n155\n00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.860\nI mean you should memorize\nyour social security number.\n\n156\n00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.030\nI mean that's something, or\n\n157\n00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:08.400\nwhere ever you are, what the equivalent\nnumber is, is something that you memorize.\n\n158\n00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.640\nI know what mine is off the top\nof my head as most people do.\n\n159\n00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.702\nYeah, that's right.\n\n160\n00:09:14.702 --> 00:09:19.310\n>> [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] You\nknow you wanted me to.\n\n161\n00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.400\n>> [INAUDIBLE] I wanted\nto get in on that one.\n\n162\n00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.320\nBut you get that situation and\nyeah you should be memorizing it.\n\n163\n00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:36.450\nAnd that's fine but there are some\nplaces that they will just ask you for\n\n164\n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:41.160\nyour social security number,\nand they really don't need it.\n\n165\n00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.070\nYou see it in a lot of places\nwhere what's the last 4, or\n\n166\n00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.170\nwhat's your social security number.\n\n167\n00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.710\nI'm one of those people just\nby nature of what I do, and\n\n168\n00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:54.620\nbeing naturally going on\nthe side of being paranoid,\n\n169\n00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.650\nI see what they're asking for\nand go what do you need it for?\n\n170\n00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:58.560\nWell we need it.\n\n171\n00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.980\nThat's not my question.\n\n172\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.190\nYou can't answer it,\nI'm not giving it to you.\n\n173\n00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.100\nYou know I'm probably not gonna give it\nto you anyway, just with your attitude.\n\n174\n00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:09.760\nYou know so, it's just not something\nthat a, that I'll engage in.\n\n175\n00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.510\nMost places really don't need that.\n\n176\n00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.730\nYou know, they have no reason for that, so\n\n177\n00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.650\nthey just want a unique number,\nit's like okay.\n\n178\n00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.780\nMost people don't realize\na lot of colleges,\n\n179\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.780\nespecially like here in\nthe US you can ask for\n\n180\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.410\nan alternative number to be assigned\nto you other than your social security.\n\n181\n00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.020\nYou don't need that.\n\n182\n00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.530\nMost people use their social security.\n\n183\n00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.570\nBut it's just not a normal thing.\n\n184\n00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.720\nI see in other situations\nwith social security numbers,\n\n185\n00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.050\nit shows the type of training\nthat goes into having\n\n186\n00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:47.448\na lot of friends with military backgrounds\nand being in that environment.\n\n187\n00:10:47.448 --> 00:10:51.920\nWhat are you trained to do\nwhen you sign in someplace.\n\n188\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.060\nYou sign your name, and your social.\n\n189\n00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.800\n>> Your last 4.\n\n190\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.100\n>> Yeah, your last 4 go down there.\n\n191\n00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:01.780\nSince it becomes a way of life for however\nlong you're in, what happens when you come\n\n192\n00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:08.540\nout and someone asks for your, or\nneeds a social security number from you.\n\n193\n00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.980\nYou just provide it\nwithout thinking about it.\n\n194\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.530\nCuz it's been shoved into your head.\n\n195\n00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.478\n>> Sure, 91, 88, sure.\n[LAUGH].\n\n196\n00:11:14.478 --> 00:11:18.990\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah they'll start\nchattering away on it and say I.\n\n197\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.160\n>> I'll give it to you.\n\n198\n00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.970\nI had a good friend that came out\nafter 12 years in the airforce,\n\n199\n00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.090\nhe was just readily doing that.\n\n200\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.510\nYou know you've got to do that.\n\n201\n00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.280\nYou just have to.\n\n202\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.178\nYou are working the security field.\n\n203\n00:11:34.178 --> 00:11:34.918\nStop it.\n\n204\n00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:40.360\n[LAUGH] He was like, \"oh, ok,\" it\ntook him awhile to break that habit.\n\n205\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:46.610\n>> But people kind of play it all fast and\n\n206\n00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.410\nwhatever with that type of PII they\ndon't realize significance of it so\n\n207\n00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:55.250\nyou really gotta be careful\nwith what happens with this.\n\n208\n00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.000\nRemember the information you're handling,\nthe significance of it.\n\n209\n00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.400\nMy personal thing, myself,\nany bit of information,\n\n210\n00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.430\nfirst of all if I don't see a reason\nthat you need it, you're not getting it.\n\n211\n00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.790\nThat's for me to decide not for\nthem to decide,\n\n212\n00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.590\nI don't care how much they whine and\ncomplain, they're not going to get it.\n\n213\n00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.310\nThe other thing is if I don't\nknow what can be done with it\n\n214\n00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.830\nyou're not gonna get it, period.\n\n215\n00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.510\nJust because I haven't found\na way you can use it against me,\n\n216\n00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.980\ndoesn't mean I'm just gonna say okay, well\nI haven't thought about it so it's fine.\n\n217\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.630\nIf you don't need it, and\neven if I haven't found a way,\n\n218\n00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.410\nyou're not gonna get it.\n\n219\n00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.830\nIf I don't have a definitive reason, on\nwhy you need that, you're not getting it.\n\n220\n00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.370\nStuff like that will tend to keep\npeople safe and stuff like that.\n\n221\n00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.850\nThat still doesn't cover the people that\nare managing it because it's not their's.\n\n222\n00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.940\nPeople like to pry and poke around stuff.\n\n223\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.500\nAnd it's kind of human nature.\n\n224\n00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.090\nSomeone's put it down to human instinct.\n\n225\n00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:56.390\nI read an article last night where\nsomeone was taking pictures of\n\n226\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:04.570\nIt was a Navy guy that was taking\npictures of the nuclear area of a vessel.\n\n227\n00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.240\nAnd there was no evidence that he's\nactually distributed those things any\n\n228\n00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.540\nplace, but yeah, he's facing at\nleast 20 years in prison for that.\n\n229\n00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.990\nAnd it shows what people said,\n\n230\n00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.690\nwell heck it's a place where he worked, he\nwanted to have a memory of working there.\n\n231\n00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.670\nThey said it's just human nature,\nthat you wanna do that.\n\n232\n00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.940\nI can understand that, but there's also\nthe case that that's a classified thing,\n\n233\n00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.480\nand on top of it,\nthe way the story broke and he got caught,\n\n234\n00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.840\nis someone found a phone\non top of a trash can.\n\n235\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:42.120\nAnd this is the PII and everything\ncome together in a big train wreck.\n\n236\n00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.070\nSomeone found a phone on top of the trash\nand the guy said oh I need a new phone.\n\n237\n00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.340\nAnd so he picked it up and\nwas going through it.\n\n238\n00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.410\nFound information on it and\nI knew who the guy was and\n\n239\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.770\nthe also found these pictures on it.\n\n240\n00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.050\nSo he showed it to somebody he\nknew who was a retired navy chief.\n\n241\n00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.930\nAnd the guy said, the guy immediately\ncalled the NCIS in the area and\n\n242\n00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.250\nthey Pick the guy up, and yeah.\n\n243\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.640\nIt was a big mess.\n\n244\n00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.300\n>> So we know what personally\nidentifiable information is, and\n\n245\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.850\nwe know we've got to secure it.\n\n246\n00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.130\nAnd I guess the big fear,\n\n247\n00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.360\nany time we know we're storing information\nlike that is it getting out, like that.\n\n248\n00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.040\nLike that phone.\n\n249\n00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.720\nOr in a company, you know, we've heard of,\n\n250\n00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.150\nall we have to do is go back 6 months\non the news and you can find at least 2\n\n251\n00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:30.800\nincidents where organizations\nhave had data stolen from them.\n\n252\n00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.990\nYeah and\nto be honest if we back up it's gotta be.\n\n253\n00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.070\nSomething that yeah, like you said, you\ndo see more, you see it being reported.\n\n254\n00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:45.260\nThe question is now, for me when I\nsee that, is it happening more or\n\n255\n00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.490\nis it just being reported more?\n\n256\n00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.980\nAnd so, or is it both?\n\n257\n00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:55.560\nIt's something that you,\nthat kind of goes around and\n\n258\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.340\ngets inside your head a bit,\nit's like what side is that actually on?\n\n259\n00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:05.970\nSo that's one thing, but\nbreaches are a big deal, and\n\n260\n00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:11.210\nusually when you have a breach you have\nthem on small scales, just a record or\n\n261\n00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:16.260\ntwo sometimes, but\nthen you do have these large scale ones.\n\n262\n00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.700\nThe small ones unfortunately\nhappen all the time.\n\n263\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.490\nAnd a lot of places that handle this and\nare really serious about this, they have\n\n264\n00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:29.630\nvery, very specific reporting procedures\nif that's suspected of happening.\n\n265\n00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.720\nJust if it's suspected,\n\n266\n00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.720\nif they know it's happening that\ntakes it to a whole other level.\n\n267\n00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.570\nAs an example,\nI know an agency in California.\n\n268\n00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:47.239\nIf they have any sort of question of\nPII was lost control of at any point,\n\n269\n00:15:47.239 --> 00:15:53.147\nthey file it as an incident with\nthe hire patrol in California.\n\n270\n00:15:53.147 --> 00:15:56.291\nSo you get Poncho and John,\nI don't know whatever,\n\n271\n00:15:56.291 --> 00:15:58.441\ncoming in and do their thing, but.\n\n272\n00:15:58.441 --> 00:16:01.613\nThe reason why it's Highway Patrol\nis that's a statewide agency,\n\n273\n00:16:01.613 --> 00:16:02.899\na law enforcement agency.\n\n274\n00:16:02.899 --> 00:16:06.948\nSince we don't have state\ntroopers in California,\n\n275\n00:16:06.948 --> 00:16:11.650\nthat got rid of years ago,\nit actually got rolled to the CHP.\n\n276\n00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.720\nSo CHP being the only statewide agency,\nyou can't go to the sheriffs,\n\n277\n00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.100\nthey want something at the state level,\n\n278\n00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.410\ncan coordinate with all of\nthe different agencies.\n\n279\n00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.857\nAnd the state agencies that have\ndifferent offices all over the state,\n\n280\n00:16:23.857 --> 00:16:25.590\nthey want to have them handle that.\n\n281\n00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.193\nSo that's who it gets reported to.\n\n282\n00:16:27.193 --> 00:16:30.774\nBut anyway,\nit does tell you just how serious that is.\n\n283\n00:16:30.774 --> 00:16:34.420\nThat if it gets reported or\nif that happens, it immediately,\n\n284\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.250\nbefore anything happens on that\nin the containment whatever,\n\n285\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:42.000\nit has to get reported directly\nto the CHP, who takes a report.\n\n286\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.180\nAnd then will then clear you, or\n\n287\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.860\nnot, to take the next step\nin dealing with that issue.\n\n288\n00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.169\nThey do not mess around with that.\n\n289\n00:16:49.169 --> 00:16:53.175\nAnd the friend that I know that works for\nthe agency says yeah,\n\n290\n00:16:53.175 --> 00:16:57.179\nwhen they come in and do stuff,\nit gets to the right point, and\n\n291\n00:16:57.179 --> 00:17:02.780\nyeah it's gonna turn out really nasty,\nsomeone's gonna get hurt pretty bad.\n\n292\n00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.618\n>> And\nI guess there's also a steep penalty.\n\n293\n00:17:05.618 --> 00:17:08.921\nYou've mentioned a couple times that when\nyou're dealing with stuff like this you\n\n294\n00:17:08.921 --> 00:17:11.608\nhave to be aware, not only how to\ntake care of this information, but\n\n295\n00:17:11.608 --> 00:17:12.660\nthe consequences of not.\n\n296\n00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.720\nI mean data breach is a horrible thing and\n\n297\n00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.850\ncould cost your company, heck,\nthe whole company itself.\n\n298\n00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:19.920\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> But there's also the fines,\n\n299\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.940\nbecause some of these laws\nare not just my company, right.\n\n300\n00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.290\nI've go industry regulations,\n\n301\n00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.050\nI've got governmental regulations\nthat I've got to deal with.\n\n302\n00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.586\n>> Yeah, there's a tremendous amount\nof regulations relating to this\n\n303\n00:17:32.586 --> 00:17:36.582\nboth from the federal standpoint and\nthe state standpoint.\n\n304\n00:17:36.582 --> 00:17:40.702\nAnd even within individual\nindustries themselves,\n\n305\n00:17:40.702 --> 00:17:46.800\nwill have their own guidelines and\nrules on how its supposed to be handled.\n\n306\n00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:52.636\nAnd if you break these things, heaven help\nyou if you break some of these things.\n\n307\n00:17:52.636 --> 00:17:55.130\nCuz they'll come down at\nyou like a load of bricks.\n\n308\n00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.910\nYou won't know what hit you.\n\n309\n00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.248\n>> Even if you didn't have a data breach,\n\n310\n00:17:58.248 --> 00:18:00.930\nif they find out that you're not\nfollowing proper procedures.\n\n311\n00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.835\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> It's gonna get levied against you.\n\n312\n00:18:03.835 --> 00:18:06.965\n>> Yeah, that's a very good\npoint when you bring this up.\n\n313\n00:18:06.965 --> 00:18:15.565\nYou don't have to go as far to have a data\nbreach to keep a penalty from happening.\n\n314\n00:18:15.565 --> 00:18:21.772\nThey can say an agency can have a breach\nand then that regulatory body or\n\n315\n00:18:21.772 --> 00:18:26.032\nwhatever, could come in and do a regular\naudit or find out through the grapevine or\n\n316\n00:18:26.032 --> 00:18:29.682\nwhatever that you had a case\nwhere it was mishandled.\n\n317\n00:18:29.682 --> 00:18:32.952\nAnd, if they find that out and\nyou didn't tell them directly,\n\n318\n00:18:32.952 --> 00:18:34.332\nthere's already a penalty for that.\n\n319\n00:18:34.332 --> 00:18:36.410\nIt's like it was unreported.\n\n320\n00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.460\nAnd then there's the next step of,\nwhat happened?\n\n321\n00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.340\nWas this negligence on your point or\nis this accidental?\n\n322\n00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.570\nDepending on what they find out\nthey can levy a whole other\n\n323\n00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.050\nset of things against you.\n\n324\n00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.884\nThey do not mess around with this stuff.\n\n325\n00:18:50.884 --> 00:18:55.608\nThey're getting to be a lot more serious\nwith the way they handle this and\n\n326\n00:18:55.608 --> 00:18:58.560\nthere could be some\npretty stiff penalties.\n\n327\n00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:06.310\nYou can talk penalties, usually they're\nall kind of in this area of being civil.\n\n328\n00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:11.530\nWell actually, they're more kind of an\nadministrative law area us what they'd be.\n\n329\n00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.970\nThey're usually gonna hit you with\nsome pretty steep monetary penalties,\n\n330\n00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.205\ndepending on what\nregulations apply to you.\n\n331\n00:19:19.205 --> 00:19:23.640\nHIPAA happens to be one of the ones\nthat is pretty stiff on that.\n\n332\n00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.020\nThey fine you basically\nthe same amount per incident.\n\n333\n00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.215\nSo, in theory if, I think one of\nthem's like there's 100 grand or\n\n334\n00:19:33.215 --> 00:19:35.624\nsomething per incident\nthey can hit you with.\n\n335\n00:19:35.624 --> 00:19:38.447\nSo if you lost control of 5 records,\n\n336\n00:19:38.447 --> 00:19:42.740\nthere's already half a mil\nbeing dropped right there.\n\n337\n00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:47.930\nThey just do not mess around with it,\nthey'll nail you pretty hard with that.\n\n338\n00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:55.340\nSo there's extra incentive to really\nmake sure those things are being obeyed.\n\n339\n00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.520\n>> And then I know in recent times we've\nhad a lot of cases of data breaches.\n\n340\n00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.350\nYou could probably give\nus some good examples.\n\n341\n00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:07.250\n>> Yeah, there's some unfortunate ones\nthat have happened in recent history.\n\n342\n00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:11.058\nThe one that's happened\nmost recently has been\n\n343\n00:20:11.058 --> 00:20:15.159\nthe Office of Personnel Management\nhere in the US.\n\n344\n00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:19.660\nThe Office of Personnel Management\nhad a major, major,\n\n345\n00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:25.968\nmajor data breach not too long ago, and\nit was a substantial number of records.\n\n346\n00:20:25.968 --> 00:20:34.044\nI was just kinda quickly looking up to see\nif I could find the news clipping from it,\n\n347\n00:20:34.044 --> 00:20:40.550\nfrom the OPM itself to show you\nkind of how they responded to it.\n\n348\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:47.930\nBut says here April 15th of this\nyear they discovered that personal\n\n349\n00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:51.270\ndata of 4.2 current and former federal\ngovernment employees had been stolen.\n\n350\n00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:55.220\nAnd that's on top of\nan additional level of things.\n\n351\n00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.540\nThey found out that there was\nadditional stuff being compromised.\n\n352\n00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.380\nThey found out, and here's the PII stuff.\n\n353\n00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.260\nThey found information that included\nsocial security numbers of 21.5 million\n\n354\n00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:10.390\nindividuals was stolen from\nbackground investigation databases.\n\n355\n00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.033\nIf you're not sure what\nbackground investigations are,\n\n356\n00:21:14.033 --> 00:21:19.027\nthat's what they do when they're getting\nyou ready for a security clearance.\n\n357\n00:21:19.027 --> 00:21:22.393\nSo if you're going to go for\na secret or top secret SCI and\n\n358\n00:21:22.393 --> 00:21:24.124\nall those things like that.\n\n359\n00:21:24.124 --> 00:21:29.475\nThere's even like Yankee White and\nstuff like that, security ratings,\n\n360\n00:21:29.475 --> 00:21:33.630\nthey keep going up the food chain,\nthat's what they do.\n\n361\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:38.340\nAnd when you get those clearances,\nit's not just you,\n\n362\n00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:42.160\nin some cases that's friends and\nfamily members are filling that out too.\n\n363\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.240\nSo you're talking pretty\nsubstantial stuff.\n\n364\n00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:51.530\nSo when they talk about this, actually\nthat's 21.5 million individuals for\n\n365\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.920\nbackground, and\n19.7 of that was specifically for\n\n366\n00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:01.030\npeople that were going just for\nbackground investigations.\n\n367\n00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:05.742\nAnd then there's also, factoring into\nthat, they said 1.8 million there was\n\n368\n00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:09.660\nnon-applicants, spouses,\ncohabitants of applicants.\n\n369\n00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.240\nSo, there's your friends and\nfamily members that got hit with that.\n\n370\n00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:13.804\nAnd then,\n\n371\n00:22:13.804 --> 00:22:18.449\nthe scariest thing as part of this is the\n1.1 million of those include fingerprints.\n\n372\n00:22:18.449 --> 00:22:19.017\n>> Wow.\n\n373\n00:22:19.017 --> 00:22:21.561\n>> So,\nwhen you start classifying the data,\n\n374\n00:22:21.561 --> 00:22:25.945\nI mean how much more personally\nidentifiable information do you need than\n\n375\n00:22:25.945 --> 00:22:30.840\nto have 1.1 million of those include\nfingerprints with the rest of your stuff.\n\n376\n00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.953\nThey know who you are, social security\nnumber, where you live, financial data.\n\n377\n00:22:33.953 --> 00:22:36.529\nI mean that's a huge score for\n\n378\n00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:42.000\nsomeone that got that because\nthey know everything about you.\n\n379\n00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.490\nIt's not just your normal grade,\nif we can call it that,\n\n380\n00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:51.200\nof PII where they have your name, address,\nsocial security number, stuff like that.\n\n381\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.320\nThey've gone way,\nway above and beyond that.\n\n382\n00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.390\nThey know where you've lived for\nthe last x number of years,\n\n383\n00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.790\ndepending on what clearance\nyou're applying for.\n\n384\n00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:06.600\nSo they know where you've lived,\nthey know finance, know family members.\n\n385\n00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.178\nThey may even have those\nfamily members and friends and\n\n386\n00:23:10.178 --> 00:23:13.630\nco-habitants they say,\nthey may have their stuff now.\n\n387\n00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:19.120\nI mean there's just a tremendous amount of\nstuff that's gonna be included in that.\n\n388\n00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.080\nSo the information at this point has\nnot actually surfaced any place either.\n\n389\n00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.180\nSo they're not sure 100%\nwhat's being done with it.\n\n390\n00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.950\nIs that someone hijacked it and they\njust don't know where it's being done.\n\n391\n00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:33.970\nIt's probably in the darknet or\nsomething some place at this point.\n\n392\n00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:38.680\nBut it got snagged.\n\n393\n00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.930\nAnd you can see here that Roberto says,\nlike the OPM.\n\n394\n00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:46.960\nHow many people actually know about this?\n\n395\n00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.689\nHe's one of the few that I know that,\n\n396\n00:23:49.689 --> 00:23:53.399\noutside the few that\nare directly affected by it.\n\n397\n00:23:53.399 --> 00:23:57.517\nAnd even those people,\na lot of them don't know about this too.\n\n398\n00:23:57.517 --> 00:24:01.301\nI've run into that numerous times where\nyou kind of have to tap on a shoulder.\n\n399\n00:24:01.301 --> 00:24:05.736\nIt's like, did you Did you ever apply for\nthis or get involved in this?\n\n400\n00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:12.816\nAnd you find out that they did, and\nyou may wanna read this just in case so\n\n401\n00:24:12.816 --> 00:24:19.680\nyou can a little double check to see\nif you're in that affected area.\n\n402\n00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.480\nBut that was just one example.\n\n403\n00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.450\nIt's a very massive breach of things.\n\n404\n00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.660\nIn my opinion,\nwasn't very well publicized.\n\n405\n00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.980\nThey should have publicized it a bit more.\n\n406\n00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.660\nAnd the biggest thing I've seen happen\nwith it so far in addition to this report,\n\n407\n00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.360\nthe OPM the stuff I just read\nyou is on their website,\n\n408\n00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.240\nthe biggest fallout I've seen from it so\nfar is the head of the agency got fired.\n\n409\n00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.660\nThat seems what they always do is like oh,\nfire the head of agency.\n\n410\n00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.800\nIt's like what else are you doing?\n\n411\n00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.290\nAnything else they've done to help\npeople has been all reactive.\n\n412\n00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:59.660\nIt's kind of like that old fairy tale,\nnursery rhyme, or whatever.\n\n413\n00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.930\nThe kid's sticking his finger\nin the dyke to stop the leak,\n\n414\n00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.960\nIt's like that's what\nthey're doing right now.\n\n415\n00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.290\nLook I stopped it.\n\n416\n00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.315\nWell why don't you fix\nwhat the problem is?\n\n417\n00:25:08.315 --> 00:25:11.450\n[LAUGH] On the other side,\nthey're not addressing that.\n\n418\n00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:17.290\nAnd so more companies, more places\nare addressing this proactively.\n\n419\n00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.000\nBut you still have this problem and\nyou know what I see.\n\n420\n00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.020\nThe talk and hear the chatroom about\nthe VA and stuff like that scroll by.\n\n421\n00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.510\nYeah, the VA's had it.\n\n422\n00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:29.360\nThere's other places\noverseas that have had it.\n\n423\n00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.550\nSo, this is not something\nthat is going away.\n\n424\n00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.390\nIt's something that needs to\nbe taken a lot more seriously.\n\n425\n00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.130\nThe penalties are getting stiffer and\nstiffer for\n\n426\n00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:41.940\nthis to make sure that people are really\nkinda enforcing this sort of thing and\n\n427\n00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.540\nare paying much more attention to it.\n\n428\n00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.998\nBut we unfortunately\nstill have this stuff.\n\n429\n00:25:45.998 --> 00:25:49.380\nAnd it's gonna become even worse once\nwe start getting more biometric data\n\n430\n00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.570\nstored in there.\n\n431\n00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:56.120\nWe saw David here talk about the DNA\n\n432\n00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:01.234\naspect of it,\nthey're collecting DNA from people now,\n\n433\n00:26:01.234 --> 00:26:04.970\nso there's just a lot of ways\nthat it could be compromised.\n\n434\n00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:08.180\nDNA I haven't seen anything\ndone with that yet,\n\n435\n00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.160\nbut I think that's only a matter of time.\n\n436\n00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.930\nIt's just not practical really to\ndo anything with DNA at this point.\n\n437\n00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:16.520\n>> There's a company out there right\nnow that you can custom order DNA.\n\n438\n00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.350\nThey will custom make DNA strands for you.\n\n439\n00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.910\nThat's out there.\n\n440\n00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.650\nYeah, scary stuff.\n\n441\n00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.440\nI guess as a cast, we really just\ngot to make sure that we have a good\n\n442\n00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.650\nunderstanding of,\nfirst of all, what it is,\n\n443\n00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:32.620\nbecause we've got to know if this\nrequires that extra level of protection.\n\n444\n00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.780\nAnd we've gotta know what that\nextra level of protection is.\n\n445\n00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.710\nWhat do we need to do because, as Shawn\nsaid, there's many different regulations\n\n446\n00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.610\nthat might fall from\nthe industry that you're in or\n\n447\n00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.010\nthe government that you're under.\n\n448\n00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:49.120\nBesides just company regulations, that\nyou have to make sure you're following.\n\n449\n00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.040\nBecause not only could it lead to\na data breach if you don't, but\n\n450\n00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.202\nit could lead to penalties on top of,\nto add insult to injury.\n\n451\n00:26:56.202 --> 00:27:00.090\nSo it makes it tough for a company\nto survive an event like that, so\n\n452\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:04.885\nvery important that we have a good grasp\nof what it is and how to protect it.\n\n453\n00:27:04.885 --> 00:27:11.055\nAnything else we want to throw into\nthis one before we wrap it up?\n\n454\n00:27:11.055 --> 00:27:14.175\n>> To throw something else in there\nkind of as a little interesting little\n\n455\n00:27:14.175 --> 00:27:18.815\nfoot note to it, because we were just\nmentioning the DNA aspect of it,\n\n456\n00:27:18.815 --> 00:27:21.945\none of the things I had heard about.\n\n457\n00:27:21.945 --> 00:27:23.995\nAnd this has been confirmed,\n\n458\n00:27:23.995 --> 00:27:28.840\nwhen Obama got elected to his first term,\none of the things that came out and\n\n459\n00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.430\nand I don't know if they had to just\nstart doing this fairly recently.\n\n460\n00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:36.220\nSo I don't know if they started doing it\nfor Bush the beginning of his first term\n\n461\n00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:41.680\nand all the way through his presidency,\nbut I noticed that definitely Obama, they\n\n462\n00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:46.580\nare so concerned with personal\ninformation and stuff like that.\n\n463\n00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.640\nObviously in his case, with that office,\nit's a little more tough for him.\n\n464\n00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.050\nBut they actually have some of\nthe Secret Service whenever he goes and\n\n465\n00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:54.490\nhas a drink some place.\n\n466\n00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.540\nThat person takes the glass and goes with.\n\n467\n00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.860\nIt does not stay there.\n\n468\n00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:04.380\nAny drink that the President goes,\nthere's some guy in his detail that and\n\n469\n00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:04.990\nit puts it.\n\n470\n00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.972\nSo they don't know what could be done\nwith it, but they're not taking a chance.\n\n471\n00:28:07.972 --> 00:28:08.796\n>> Right.\n\n472\n00:28:08.796 --> 00:28:10.399\n>> So it's kind of a fascinating thing.\n\n473\n00:28:10.399 --> 00:28:12.652\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just think about the next time you're\n\n474\n00:28:12.652 --> 00:28:14.170\nwatching them at a dinner or\nsomething like that.\n\n475\n00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.675\nThere's some guy that's like,\nexcuse me and grabs it.\n\n476\n00:28:16.675 --> 00:28:18.130\n[LAUGH]\n>> There's a job\n\n477\n00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:21.140\nto go right along with your,\nstanding in the front room.\n\n478\n00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.693\nI wait for\nthe President to finish drinking.\n\n479\n00:28:22.693 --> 00:28:24.714\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's your whole job.\n\n480\n00:28:24.714 --> 00:28:26.708\nWhat experience do you\nhave with beverages?\n\n481\n00:28:26.708 --> 00:28:28.770\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n482\n00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:30.690\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n483\n00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.380\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n484\n00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.620\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n485\n00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.540\n>> And I'm Shawn Oreano.\n\n486\n00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:36.572\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:14.050\nI am your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.520\nHere today is Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.590\nHow are you doing today, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.990\n>> Pretty good.\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.660\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.490\nWe got another one of our\nCompTIA Advance Security practitioner\n\n9\n00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.730\nepisodes coming your way.\n\n10\n00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.160\nIn this one, Sean, we're gonna be going\nover auditing requirements and frequency.\n\n11\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.476\nSounds as exciting as\nour documents episodes.\n\n12\n00:00:31.476 --> 00:00:32.868\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:34.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, right?\n\n14\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.430\nYeah, we're talking about a type of\nauditing that Tom Cruise goes to.\n\n15\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.815\nAnd he goes to scientology,\nthose things where you're holding on.\n\n16\n00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:42.635\n[LAUGH] We're going to get sued.\n\n17\n00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:46.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> So chopping that one out now,\n\n18\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.180\nit is another important part, right?\n\n19\n00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.580\nBecause there's, again, similar to what we\ntalked about PII and securing documents,\n\n20\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.890\nthere's lots of legal\nregulations that are in place.\n\n21\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.890\nIndustry, governmental and\njust some of the things that this\n\n22\n00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.210\ngives us the ability to do auditing is\na very important part of our security.\n\n23\n00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.160\n>> Yes, it's one of those things that what\nyou're doing is we're not saying your\n\n24\n00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.960\nsecurity doesn't work,\n\n25\n00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.868\nwe're just saying that you have a way\nof verifying that it's working.\n\n26\n00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:18.870\nAnd a third-party could come in and\ndo this, or you could do this yourself.\n\n27\n00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.308\nPresumably both, if you're going to\nplay in the safest possible way.\n\n28\n00:01:23.308 --> 00:01:25.160\nYou don't just want to wait\nuntil the big boys come in and\n\n29\n00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.100\nthey find something is wrong.\n\n30\n00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.190\nThe next step is, where's your checkbook.\n\n31\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.440\nThey could very well hit you at\nthat point if they wanted to.\n\n32\n00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.290\nSometimes they really do\nwant to because they're not,\n\n33\n00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.300\nthey've had too many\nincidents with this stuff so\n\n34\n00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.080\nthey just don't want to even mess\naround all that much with it anymore.\n\n35\n00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.720\nSo auditing plays a big, big, big,\n\n36\n00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.310\nbig important role in verifying what,\nare your security mechanisms working?\n\n37\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.480\nAre your handling mechanisms\nworking correctly?\n\n38\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.098\nKind of all that stuff.\n\n39\n00:01:57.098 --> 00:02:02.920\nFrom a CASP standpoint, this may be\nsomething that is entirely possible\n\n40\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.680\nthat you may move\nstrictly in to this area.\n\n41\n00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.220\nThere are cases where this is\nenough of a job in itself,\n\n42\n00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.530\nthat you have to do this full-time.\n\n43\n00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.610\nThey can't just say,\nthis is part of your job responsibilities.\n\n44\n00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.190\nYou're involved with it full-time.\n\n45\n00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.090\nIf you've ever seen an audit, you know\nit's something that they could be doing\n\n46\n00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.140\na real serious rotor rooter job on things\nand getting really deeply into stuff and\n\n47\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.120\nfiguring out what's going to,\nfiguring out what's going on.\n\n48\n00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.500\nAnd so you gotta figure you're managing\nthat, you could actually have, I've\n\n49\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.860\nseen it from the other side of people in\nthe trenches that are dealing with audits.\n\n50\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.600\nAnd that takes a substantial\nperiod of their time to do it and\n\n51\n00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.560\nthey're not looking at it\nat the CASP type level so.\n\n52\n00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.760\nIt is an important thing and that's why\nyou might end up just doing this as\n\n53\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.580\na full-time thing once\nyou get that credential.\n\n54\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.920\nOr you might just have to\nknow the requirements, or\n\n55\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.380\nbe interactive requirements but\nsomeone else is asking that.\n\n56\n00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.020\nSo, it's a pretty heavy duty stuff that\n\n57\n00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.050\ncan get you into some pretty serious\ntrouble if the wrong things are turned up.\n\n58\n00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.630\n>> Absolutely.\n\n59\n00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.010\nI always know when it's audit time,\n\n60\n00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.660\nthe companies I have worked with before\nbecause you've got a couple people who\n\n61\n00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.940\nshow up with briefcases that go into\nthe conference room all by themselves.\n\n62\n00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.990\nThe boss is running around\nin a very bad mood that day.\n\n63\n00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.930\nWith auditing, I think,\nat this point we understand.\n\n64\n00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.425\n>> Are they two guys\nthey call them both Bob.\n\n65\n00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:25.620\n>> Yeah [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n66\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.330\nYou know the guys I'm talking about.\n\n67\n00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.380\n>> Yeah I know those guys.\n\n68\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.950\n>> So you know at this point in our\ncareers we understand what auditing is so\n\n69\n00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.447\nwe don't have to get into creating\nauditing policies, I don't think, right?\n\n70\n00:03:37.447 --> 00:03:41.220\nBut we do need to know, when we create\nthose policies, what we include and\n\n71\n00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.085\nwhat we don't include,\nthat's not something we get to pick right?\n\n72\n00:03:45.085 --> 00:03:50.119\nYeah, you don't always get to have\ndirect influence on what's, or\n\n73\n00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:55.070\ncontrol over what's going\nto be chosen as far\n\n74\n00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.750\nas auditing requirements, that could be\nsolely dictated by an external agency.\n\n75\n00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.060\nYou really don't have any\nsay in it whatsoever,\n\n76\n00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.000\nit's basically, this is the requirements,\nyou carry them out.\n\n77\n00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.650\nAnd if you're like, but those\nrequirements, and somebody's gonna say,\n\n78\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.250\nthese are the requirements, you carry them\nout, I didn't hear what you just said.\n\n79\n00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.970\nSo it could very well go that way.\n\n80\n00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.750\nI've seen it go that way, and\nby necessity, it has to be that way,\n\n81\n00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.010\nsomeone has to take control of it and say,\nthis is the way things need to be done.\n\n82\n00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.880\nYou have to dot your Is and\ncross your Ts in this particular way.\n\n83\n00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.430\nThat's it.\n\n84\n00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.540\nThere is not going to be\nany variation from that.\n\n85\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.420\nThey want to make sure they\nhave consistent, reliable and\n\n86\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.410\nmeasurable results.\n\n87\n00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.820\nThey can't have people doing\nit all their different ways.\n\n88\n00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.332\nSo it's very, very important that\n\n89\n00:04:42.332 --> 00:04:46.450\nwhen the requirements come to play\nthere's a standard has to be done.\n\n90\n00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.840\nThe question is,\nis what set of standards because this is\n\n91\n00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.860\na huge can of worms that\nyou're waiting to open.\n\n92\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.240\nSo you could have stuff for the various\nregulations that we talked about for\n\n93\n00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.190\nthe certain, specific industries.\n\n94\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.560\nBut then you have other ones that are\ndictated by ISO and the ISO organization,\n\n95\n00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.250\nand then there's COBIT that\nhas a set of standards, and\n\n96\n00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.850\nthen they just keep going and\ngoing and going and going.\n\n97\n00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.500\nThere's all different acronyms out there\nfor doing this and in fact, there's even\n\n98\n00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.490\nspecific training and credentials, even,\nthat pertain just to doing audits.\n\n99\n00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.110\nThat they're preparing you for\nis to make sure that you can\n\n100\n00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.860\ndo a thorough enough audit and make sure\neverything's the way it's supposed to be.\n\n101\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.130\nYou know the one that comes to mind,\nit's another different credential but\n\n102\n00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.130\nis the CISA.\n\n103\n00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.564\nYou know that's something that had to be\nbrought up by someone other than CompTIA,\n\n104\n00:05:45.564 --> 00:05:49.380\nit's something that deals\nspecifically with auditing.\n\n105\n00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.420\nThey're trying to teach you how\nto perform a nice reliable and\n\n106\n00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.810\nconsistent well thought out audit, because\nthey don't want any bumps in the road or\n\n107\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.370\nany inconsistency, so they have\nsomeone specially trained to do that.\n\n108\n00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.060\nYou may actually at some point\nas someone that holds the CASP,\n\n109\n00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.290\nyou may actually have to get additional\ntraining on how to perform an audit.\n\n110\n00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.010\nIf they're going to put you in that role.\n\n111\n00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.143\nThe reason is not that we're\nshort changing you on the CASP,\n\n112\n00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:21.750\nit's because it would be impossible for\nthe CASP to say okay,\n\n113\n00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.025\nwe're going to talk about the specifics\nwith the different auditing processes.\n\n114\n00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:30.855\nBecause there's too many of them, there's\njust far too many of them out there.\n\n115\n00:06:30.855 --> 00:06:34.085\nThere's too many intricacies in them and\nto kind of shoehorn it in,\n\n116\n00:06:34.085 --> 00:06:36.905\nwouldn't do them justice and\nwould set you up for failure.\n\n117\n00:06:36.905 --> 00:06:41.335\nSo what you need to do at this point is\nyou need to recognize the requirement for\n\n118\n00:06:41.335 --> 00:06:43.645\nit and that there are different standards.\n\n119\n00:06:43.645 --> 00:06:47.290\nAnd then if you don't have\na current auditing program in place\n\n120\n00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.370\nYou as a CASP will now have\nthe knowledge to start saying, okay.\n\n121\n00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.320\nWell, how can I choose, or what brainpower\ndo you need to bring in to help me\n\n122\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.860\ndecide which one to choose and which one's\nrequirements I'm gonna need to adhere to.\n\n123\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.720\nTypically any large,\nmedium to enterprise level company,\n\n124\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.900\nwe'll put it that way, is gonna have\nsome sort of audit requirements.\n\n125\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.350\nIt doesn't mean the smaller\nscale ones won't.\n\n126\n00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.216\nIt all depends on what they're working on.\n\n127\n00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:16.690\nIf you're a very small mom and\npop business and\n\n128\n00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.746\nyou're running a jewelry store, you don't\nhave a lot of requirements to speak of.\n\n129\n00:07:20.746 --> 00:07:25.150\nIf you're an aerospace company, or\n\n130\n00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:30.790\nsomeone working in power generation,\nsomeone working in defense, or healthcare,\n\n131\n00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:37.080\nall of those things have very specific,\nodd requirements that must be followed.\n\n132\n00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.280\nYeah, someone's gonna be\nunhappy like you said.\n\n133\n00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.810\nSomeone's just not gonna\nbe happy about it.\n\n134\n00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.360\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I think I have\n\n135\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.280\nsome of the firearms dealers.\n\n136\n00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.080\nThere's another one here that likes\nto keep a very big paper trail of\n\n137\n00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.350\neverything that happens.\n\n138\n00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.020\nYeah, that would be a case of, actually,\n\n139\n00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.878\na small scale business that needs\nto maintain those things and\n\n140\n00:07:55.878 --> 00:07:59.830\nthey're obviously considering\nwhat they're dealing with.\n\n141\n00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.912\nThey do need to keep\ntight control over and\n\n142\n00:08:02.912 --> 00:08:08.386\ntight watch on where things are going and\nwho's purchasing and all that.\n\n143\n00:08:08.386 --> 00:08:10.161\nFor safety and stuff like that.\n\n144\n00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:12.370\nSo yeah, you could very well\ncould have it in a small place.\n\n145\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.940\nSo that would be one example.\n\n146\n00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.500\n>> So how does all this work, we use\nwhat's built into our operating system?\n\n147\n00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.640\nIs that typically good enough?\n\n148\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.850\nOur audit logs and our Windows logs.\n\n149\n00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:27.360\nThere's almost like a bottomless pit\nof tools and things you can to use and\n\n150\n00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.640\nbring to bear to make audits both\nmore complicated and easier.\n\n151\n00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.610\nSometimes it seems like some of these\ntools just make things more complicated.\n\n152\n00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.248\nWhy did, why did we do that?\n\n153\n00:08:38.248 --> 00:08:41.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That just really pumped the difficulty\n\n154\n00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.030\nlevel up far too much.\n\n155\n00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.720\nIt can be computer stuff though.\n\n156\n00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.800\nA good number of it nowadays, especially\nsince we're processing a lot digitally,\n\n157\n00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.220\nthe controls are going to have\nto be in place over there.\n\n158\n00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.300\nSo what you do is you'll have controls\nin place that can monitor the stuff and\n\n159\n00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.510\nsee who is digesting it, processing it,\nand doing the whole thing.\n\n160\n00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.840\nYou'll have that, but you'll also have\nstuff for the documents we talked about.\n\n161\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.770\nFor who's doing what,\nwho's in possession of certain things.\n\n162\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.430\nThey'll be very specific stuff for\nthat too.\n\n163\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.660\nAll those things will have to be brought\ninto bear to make sure what the correct\n\n164\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.810\nsolution is.\n\n165\n00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.640\nAnd what you'll do, is you'll first\nfigure out your audit requirements are.\n\n166\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.350\nThen you'll figure out\nwhere those assets and\n\n167\n00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.182\nwhere those processing are happening\nwithin your organization.\n\n168\n00:09:23.182 --> 00:09:27.010\nAre those processes and equipment and\n\n169\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.925\nwhatever are those compliant,\nthat's something else that fits in here.\n\n170\n00:09:30.925 --> 00:09:36.570\nIs that, you may be putting new audit\nrequirements in place but may not\n\n171\n00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:42.080\nactually fit the requirements as of that\nmoment when they are presented to you.\n\n172\n00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.970\nThat's been known to happen.\n\n173\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:49.000\nYou know I think of for example with HIPA.\n\n174\n00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.570\nHIPA is one of those things.\n\n175\n00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.170\nUnless you're in healthcare,\nyou may not be aware of it.\n\n176\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:58.540\nBut HIPA was not something that just\ndropped overnight on everybody,\n\n177\n00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.890\nand is like you're going to follow this.\n\n178\n00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.710\nIt was something that was phased in and\n\n179\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.200\nit was phased in I want to say\nalmost in a period of ten years.\n\n180\n00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.950\nIt wasn't something that just all\nof a sudden just came on the scene,\n\n181\n00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:17.450\nit's something that they gave you\nsome warning that it was coming,\n\n182\n00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.180\nand when it was approved, then it said,\nokay, this is what it looks like.\n\n183\n00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.110\nAnd this is what you're gonna have\nto do by this drop-dead date, and\n\n184\n00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.400\nthen they said, okay,\nwe realize that's a lot, so\n\n185\n00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.760\nwe're gonna have different phases that\nyou have to have certain things ready.\n\n186\n00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.400\nAnd part of those things that came into\nplay along the way was to make sure you\n\n187\n00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.040\nhad time to really put those\naudit requirements in place.\n\n188\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.810\nI mean, there were other things,\nto be sure.\n\n189\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:45.420\nBut that did come into play and so\nby doing that it made it more manageable\n\n190\n00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.980\ncuz your systems may not be compliant so\nthey're trying to give you\n\n191\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.370\na chance to kind of phase\nthose things in as time goes.\n\n192\n00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:57.310\nBut you may have systems that\naren't compliant to address.\n\n193\n00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.960\nYou may have other things that need\nto be addressed as part of it.\n\n194\n00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.950\nCould be a lot of tools and\na lot of things that come into bear.\n\n195\n00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:12.870\nAs far as how they work though as far\nas once you know the types of tools and\n\n196\n00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.600\nleave it kind of vague like\nthat because there is so many.\n\n197\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:21.260\nAs far as how they work, that's going\nto be dictated by a specific need.\n\n198\n00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:28.590\nHaving seen ones done in healthcare,\nthose are actually fairly interesting.\n\n199\n00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.530\nThey have internal ones that need\nto be done, that are handed in,\n\n200\n00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.620\nthe results are handed\nto an external agency or\n\n201\n00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.110\nkept on file if they are requested\nby an external agency.\n\n202\n00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:43.920\nAnd those audits they have, in the place\nthat, you know that I was aware of,\n\n203\n00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.010\nthey actually had them scheduled, but then\nthey had ones where they could say, okay,\n\n204\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.920\nwe're going to do an audit\nright at such and such date.\n\n205\n00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.830\nThe internal auditors are coming\ndown from wherever, and\n\n206\n00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:02.240\nthey're going to be looking for\nspecific types of information and working\n\n207\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.770\nwith specific people, so they do spot\nchecks to make sure stuff was being done.\n\n208\n00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.920\nAnd that was kind of above and\nbeyond what the spec called for.\n\n209\n00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.290\nAnd they were just trying to make\nsure that when they did all this that\n\n210\n00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.990\neverything was above board and\nthey were ready for anything.\n\n211\n00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.119\nSo when the big audit came around,\nthose big audits.\n\n212\n00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.120\nA month.\n\n213\n00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.670\nWhich is actually pretty good,\nconsidering this was a large company.\n\n214\n00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.840\nA month to do it was\nactually doing pretty well.\n\n215\n00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.630\nIt's because they had everything,\nalmost everything computerized,\n\n216\n00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.470\ncompartmentalized.\n\n217\n00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.600\nSo they could send people to\nspecific areas to audit this stuff.\n\n218\n00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.170\nAnd it worked.\n\n219\n00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.170\nThey'd had more problems here and\nthere, but\n\n220\n00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.540\nthey were stuff that they caught before\nthey snowballed into something bigger.\n\n221\n00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.330\nWhich is something else that\nan audit should be able to do.\n\n222\n00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:56.610\nIf a problem happens, nothing ever\nworks like a well oiled machine.\n\n223\n00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.270\nWe know that.\n\n224\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.160\nIt may give the impression of it,\nbut they never 100% work that way.\n\n225\n00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.040\nSo what happens is that\nif you find something,\n\n226\n00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.760\nan audit gives you a chance to say,\nokay I need to take remedial action and\n\n227\n00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.110\nfigure out first of all why that happened.\n\n228\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.990\nThen figure out whatever's not compliant\nor whatever happened happened so\n\n229\n00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.730\nthat way to address that fact.Then\ncompliace will give you that chance\n\n230\n00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.122\nwill give you a chance to do that\nbefore something bad happens.\n\n231\n00:13:21.122 --> 00:13:23.980\n>> All right so now I find it\ninteresting we talked about auditing and\n\n232\n00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.980\nat the beginning there and we said not\nonly do I need to know what I need to\n\n233\n00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.880\naudit, but what I'm using to audit\nhas to be certified or how I maintain\n\n234\n00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.200\nthose records and probably length of\nhow long I have to keep those audits.\n\n235\n00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.310\nAll of that is predetermined by\nthese different regulations?\n\n236\n00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.290\n>> Yeah, absolutely there\nare standards for everything.\n\n237\n00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.160\nYou name it someone has probably\nthought of a standard for it.\n\n238\n00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.000\nThat is just way it kind of is.\n\n239\n00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.970\nFor everything, something might,\nto point to one of the things\n\n240\n00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.110\nthat one of our people in our chat room\nbrought up earlier on in the week,\n\n241\n00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:03.345\nkind of helps us out is the question\nof like hospitals and medical devices.\n\n242\n00:14:03.345 --> 00:14:05.465\nMedical devices in a lot of cases,\nthey are,\n\n243\n00:14:05.465 --> 00:14:08.245\nsince they're so complex in\nthe stuff that's going on with them,\n\n244\n00:14:08.245 --> 00:14:11.385\nthey are running embedded operating\nsystems and stuff like that.\n\n245\n00:14:11.385 --> 00:14:15.745\nStuff that, if it's hooked up,\nif it's hooked up to certain things and\n\n246\n00:14:15.745 --> 00:14:20.335\nit's in range of some of your management\nstuff for your regular desktops and\n\n247\n00:14:20.335 --> 00:14:23.425\nthings like that, that don't\nneed to be handled the same way.\n\n248\n00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.250\nThose managements get in and\nsee those medical devices and\n\n249\n00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:32.865\nsee the operating system as far as they're\nconcerned it's not anything special.\n\n250\n00:14:32.865 --> 00:14:35.740\nIt's something that has to be scanned and\nhave an agent installed on it so\n\n251\n00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.580\nthey can manage it in the future.\n\n252\n00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.270\nProblem is,\njust doing that alters that environment.\n\n253\n00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:45.820\nThat environment at some point for a lot\nof these devices was checked by the FDA.\n\n254\n00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:50.160\nThey made sure that this\nmet a certain standard,\n\n255\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.340\nthat it was safe, and that they\nhad certain things present on it.\n\n256\n00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:59.210\nOnce those were determined,\nthey signed off on it and put,\n\n257\n00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:05.130\nI'll say even though it's\nnot exactly how it happened.\n\n258\n00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.710\nThey basically put something like you\nhave at gas stations you have that little\n\n259\n00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.610\nsticker on it says this has been\ncalibrated by weights and measures,\n\n260\n00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.130\neven though they don't literally\ndo something like that.\n\n261\n00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:19.760\nIt's kind of that idea that they say okay,\nthis has been certified and\n\n262\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:25.860\nvalidated as being correct and\nbeing in compliance.\n\n263\n00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.240\nBy the very nature,\nif you try to install something on there,\n\n264\n00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.370\nit breaks that because that agent's\nnot part of that environment.\n\n265\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:36.370\nIt actually broke the situation or\nbroke or changed the environment someway.\n\n266\n00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.850\nSo now,\nthat system's not in compliance anymore.\n\n267\n00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:44.130\nSo it has to be re-audited because\nthat's not allowed to be done.\n\n268\n00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:49.450\nSo there's situations where yeah,\nyour tools they're checked to something.\n\n269\n00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:55.180\nAnd they have to be compliant within\ncertain standards and guidelines.\n\n270\n00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.179\nAnd if they're not, boom, they're not\ngonna be used until you do something\n\n271\n00:15:59.179 --> 00:16:01.038\nto get something compliant there.\n\n272\n00:16:01.038 --> 00:16:05.752\nAnd in the case of these medical devices,\nsomeone had to call the FDA going,\n\n273\n00:16:05.752 --> 00:16:10.171\nyeah we know you just Checked all\nthe stuff, can you check it again, and\n\n274\n00:16:10.171 --> 00:16:13.520\nthey had to check it every so\nmany months, too.\n\n275\n00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.860\nSo, that's kind of when you\ntalk about the frequency and\n\n276\n00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.940\nhow often it need to be done.\n\n277\n00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.960\nThrough these devices, there wasn't\nsomething that they just went through and\n\n278\n00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.900\nstuck the sticker on it and\nsaid, okay this one's good,\n\n279\n00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.066\nwe checked it out,\ncall us if you need anything.\n\n280\n00:16:27.066 --> 00:16:30.220\nNo, it got re-checked just in case,\n\n281\n00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.920\nto make sure that there wasn't\nany problems emerging or\n\n282\n00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.910\nanything like that, so it's just\nsomething to kind of be aware of.\n\n283\n00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.473\nYeah, your tools and equipment,\nthey all have to do that so.\n\n284\n00:16:41.473 --> 00:16:46.249\n>> And frequency of audits is another\nthing that very well could be dictated\n\n285\n00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:49.080\nnot by us, but by the regulations as well.\n\n286\n00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.500\nHow often we have to audit, because\nauditing isn't something we do once and\n\n287\n00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.870\nforget about it, right?\n\n288\n00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.830\n>> Yeah, it's definitely not a fire and\nforget, as I like to call it.\n\n289\n00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.960\nIt's something that is\ndefinitely going to be ongoing.\n\n290\n00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.030\nIt's a living, breathing process.\n\n291\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:06.060\nSo we typically have kind\nof a mixed bag there,\n\n292\n00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.440\ndepending how serious you want to take\nthis, how thorough you want to be.\n\n293\n00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.780\nYou can make it so\nyou do an audit just by and\n\n294\n00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:18.886\nmeet the minimum or the standard,\nwhatever standards bodies comes into play.\n\n295\n00:17:18.886 --> 00:17:20.441\nThey're going to establish standards and\n\n296\n00:17:20.441 --> 00:17:22.740\nas long as you meet that,\nyou're considered to be compliant.\n\n297\n00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.720\nThat's the way they look at it.\n\n298\n00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.810\nBut there's other places that will,\nto be safer, they\n\n299\n00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:35.250\nwill have internal audits that they\ndo that they can either do randomly.\n\n300\n00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.350\nThey can do spot checks,\nsmall spot checks here and there, or\n\n301\n00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:43.620\nthey can have ones that they just\nschedule every six months, let's say.\n\n302\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.550\nTo make sure that nothing's out of place,\nso when the big boy audit comes by,\n\n303\n00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.480\nthey're prepared for it.\n\n304\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.350\nThey can say, okay, we've done this.\n\n305\n00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.035\nAnd in keep in mind-\n>> Kind of pre-audit, audit,\n\n306\n00:17:53.035 --> 00:17:54.730\njust to make sure you're ready?\n\n307\n00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.879\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, kind of that thing.\n\n308\n00:17:56.879 --> 00:17:59.900\nYou're making sure that\neverything's all straightened up,\n\n309\n00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.580\nit's kind of like straightening up\nthe house for a guest to come over.\n\n310\n00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.360\n>> I was thinking it's\nkind of like pen testing.\n\n311\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.910\nWe want to find the issues that\nwe have before the bad guys.\n\n312\n00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:13.892\nIn this case, we want to find, through an\naudit, where we might have let something\n\n313\n00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:17.879\nfall through the cracks before\nthe industry regulators come in and\n\n314\n00:18:17.879 --> 00:18:18.894\ndo their audit.\n\n315\n00:18:18.894 --> 00:18:24.378\n>> Yeah, what is it Murphy's Law,\nthey'll find it, if you don't they will.\n\n316\n00:18:24.378 --> 00:18:27.370\nSo, and the thing is,\n\n317\n00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:33.310\nif you miss something on an audit,\nit's not always the end of the world.\n\n318\n00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.380\nIt goes, and why is that?\n\n319\n00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.349\nThat's because of something\nthat we talked about, and\n\n320\n00:18:39.349 --> 00:18:41.971\nwe talked about here, or not today.\n\n321\n00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:46.504\nBut we have talked about during this\nseries of episodes, and it's been, it's\n\n322\n00:18:46.504 --> 00:18:51.710\ntalked about in other areas too, is the\nwhole idea of due care and due diligence.\n\n323\n00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.660\nIf you can show that\nyou've been doing it and\n\n324\n00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.600\nit just happened to get missed,\nit's not a good situation by any means,\n\n325\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.910\nbut it's a lot less serious than\nif it's just gross negligence.\n\n326\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.660\nAnd you're just like yeah,\nI'm not doing this.\n\n327\n00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.780\nI'm not going to audit that.\n\n328\n00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.430\nThat's something that's\ngoing to get you busted.\n\n329\n00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.250\nIf you knew it was there and you decided\nthat you weren't going to audit it, or\n\n330\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:17.820\nsomething that, heck, you should have\nknown that this issue was there and\n\n331\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.636\nneeded to be checked.\n\n332\n00:19:18.636 --> 00:19:21.770\nThen, they're going to be\na lot less kind to you, or\n\n333\n00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.750\nthey can be a lot less\nkind to you in that case.\n\n334\n00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.830\n>> A lot of times these\naudits are proactive.\n\n335\n00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.960\nI mean, having this,\nlet's say HIPAA audit come in.\n\n336\n00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.169\nI haven't lost any data,\nthere's been no data breach.\n\n337\n00:19:32.169 --> 00:19:36.501\nIf they do find something, they might fine\nme probably, that's not going to be fun,\n\n338\n00:19:36.501 --> 00:19:40.652\nbut they are going to give me a chance to\nfix the problem and conduct another audit,\n\n339\n00:19:40.652 --> 00:19:42.484\nso that I can get back in line right?\n\n340\n00:19:42.484 --> 00:19:47.718\n>> Yeah, it's not unheard of for\nwhoever's auditing, if it's coming\n\n341\n00:19:47.718 --> 00:19:53.230\nfrom the outside to come up with a list\nof things that need to be addressed.\n\n342\n00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.737\nAnd as long as they're not something\nthat's screaming and on fire and\n\n343\n00:19:56.737 --> 00:20:00.839\nstuff like that, they're probably going\nto say these are the things that we found\n\n344\n00:20:00.839 --> 00:20:04.060\nthat weren't in compliance, and\nthey'll file a report on it.\n\n345\n00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.780\nWhich, obviously is not\ngoing to make you happy, but\n\n346\n00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.400\nit's a lot better than them saying,\n\n347\n00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.430\nhey cough up some money, or there's\ngoing to be other penalties with it.\n\n348\n00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.150\nThey'll usually say okay, well,\nthese aren't big problems,\n\n349\n00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.058\nyou need to address them.\n\n350\n00:20:19.058 --> 00:20:22.730\nI think it's not the most\n\n351\n00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.850\npleasant thing to think of\nnecessarily is restaurants,\n\n352\n00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:33.450\nthey have different levels\nof checks that they can do.\n\n353\n00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.651\nHere in the US, they've got those\nlittle grades they stick on the window.\n\n354\n00:20:36.651 --> 00:20:40.082\nAnd those grades, I mean,\nyou could miss a few things,\n\n355\n00:20:40.082 --> 00:20:42.856\nyou don't have to have a 100% score, but\n\n356\n00:20:42.856 --> 00:20:47.757\nit does make you wonder when it's like oh,\nthis place scored, got an A rating.\n\n357\n00:20:47.757 --> 00:20:51.780\nThey got 96 to 97% of the stuff right.\n\n358\n00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.622\nWell whoa, what's that 3 or\n4% that they missed?\n\n359\n00:20:55.622 --> 00:20:58.862\nHow many percentage points is\na rat dropping knock you down?\n\n360\n00:20:58.862 --> 00:21:00.360\n[LAUGH] It's like that type of stuff.\n\n361\n00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.161\n>> Is the chef not wearing his hat or\n\n362\n00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:05.660\nwas it because their dishwasher\nonly gets up to 25 degrees?\n\n363\n00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.980\nThere's big distinctions there.\n\n364\n00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:12.177\n>> Yeah, they can make little things.\n\n365\n00:21:12.177 --> 00:21:18.362\nPeople from the outside can make some\nreal kind of distinctions there.\n\n366\n00:21:18.362 --> 00:21:23.882\nIf it's something relatively minor,\nthey might just say okay, yeah, that's\n\n367\n00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:29.576\nnot the way, you're not supposed to store\nthis next to that, just take care of it.\n\n368\n00:21:29.576 --> 00:21:33.318\nBut if it's something that's much more\nserious, safety issue, or PII issue, or\n\n369\n00:21:33.318 --> 00:21:37.061\nsomething that's potentially brewing,\nthey're going to tell you, fix it, and\n\n370\n00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:40.310\nthey are not going to be\ntoo nice about it, either.\n\n371\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.260\n>> So and I know you've already mentioned\nthis kind of in a roundabout way, but\n\n372\n00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.040\nlet's talk about who conducts the audits.\n\n373\n00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.460\nSometimes these are internal,\nsometimes external.\n\n374\n00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.766\nLet's break that down a little bit.\n\n375\n00:21:49.766 --> 00:21:57.768\n>> See it could be very well you as\na CASP coming in and engaging in this.\n\n376\n00:21:57.768 --> 00:22:00.868\nAnd the reason why they would ask\nyou to do this sub as a CASP,\n\n377\n00:22:00.868 --> 00:22:04.218\nthey're looking at you as someone\nthat's more experienced and\n\n378\n00:22:04.218 --> 00:22:06.590\nknows these systems and\nis familiar with it.\n\n379\n00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.375\nSo if they're pushing you up\nto that type of position,\n\n380\n00:22:09.375 --> 00:22:13.006\nthey do kind of expect you to have some\nsort of experience or knowledge or\n\n381\n00:22:13.006 --> 00:22:16.170\nwhatever, fluency,\nwhatever it needs to get that job done.\n\n382\n00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:21.990\nSo they may have you do that or\ndevelop a team or\n\n383\n00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.840\nsomething to do that, but then again,\nthat's not always ideal for\n\n384\n00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.770\nthe same reasons that we don't always\nuse internal pen testers either.\n\n385\n00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.533\nIt's not always ideal to use internal pen\ntesters because they're not always going\n\n386\n00:22:33.533 --> 00:22:34.660\nto be objective.\n\n387\n00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.300\nThat's why you got to go on the outside\nof someone who doesn't have\n\n388\n00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.180\na horse in that race.\n\n389\n00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.660\nThey're just going to,\nthey're going to call it like they see it.\n\n390\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.630\nIt's like, that's horrible,\nthat's horrible, that,\n\n391\n00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:49.070\nyou're doing that great and this great,\nand then you go from there.\n\n392\n00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:52.820\nSo it's not unheard of to\nuse either of those or\n\n393\n00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.020\nmost likely you're going to use both.\n\n394\n00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:01.010\nYou're going to have additional\nstuff built in as necessary.\n\n395\n00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:04.198\nTypically, you've got the minimum, and\nthen they start layering on top of that.\n\n396\n00:23:04.198 --> 00:23:07.852\nOkay, these are additional things to\nmake sure that we're going above and\n\n397\n00:23:07.852 --> 00:23:11.279\nbeyond because we don't want to face\nall that nastiness or whatever.\n\n398\n00:23:11.279 --> 00:23:12.219\n>> All right, well, good.\n\n399\n00:23:12.219 --> 00:23:15.673\nAll right, well, auditing,\nanother big part of the CASP,\n\n400\n00:23:15.673 --> 00:23:18.396\nthe CompTIA Advanced\nSecurity Practitioner.\n\n401\n00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:21.130\nWe've got to be familiar\nwith all the intricacies.\n\n402\n00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.230\nNot only why we need to audit, but\n\n403\n00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.570\nhow often we need to audit, and\nhow we go about conducting those audits.\n\n404\n00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.813\nSo anything else we want\nto throw in there, Sean?\n\n405\n00:23:29.813 --> 00:23:34.410\n>> Just telling you,\nit's funny how we got people in here.\n\n406\n00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.910\nA couple of you are going through audits.\n\n407\n00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.880\nThen yeah, audits are one of those things,\nthey're not pleasant,\n\n408\n00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.810\nno one likes doing them, I know that, or\n\n409\n00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.150\nI guess there are people that like\ndoing them, there's a few out there.\n\n410\n00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.323\n>> But is it a job requirement for\nthe auditors to be not so friendly?\n\n411\n00:23:49.323 --> 00:23:50.913\n>> No, but it helps.\n\n412\n00:23:50.913 --> 00:23:54.272\n>> [LAUGH] I don't know if you've ever\nnoticed, I mean, it seems like a lot of\n\n413\n00:23:54.272 --> 00:23:57.958\nthe good majority, I shouldn't say that,\nthat's being very stereotypical,\n\n414\n00:23:57.958 --> 00:24:01.156\nbecause I definitely haven't met\nthe good majority of auditors, but\n\n415\n00:24:01.156 --> 00:24:04.761\nIt just seem like the ones I've run into\nare just not the most pleasant people.\n\n416\n00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:06.155\n>> They're very kind of,\n\n417\n00:24:06.155 --> 00:24:09.580\nI take it as they're very\nfocused on what they're doing.\n\n418\n00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.150\nThey gotta be very procedural.\n\n419\n00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:15.630\nAnd if they're coming in from the outside,\nthey're trying not to kind of,\n\n420\n00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.200\nin some cases,\nthey're trying not to engage too much.\n\n421\n00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.690\n>> To maintain that objectivity and\nno influence or anything.\n\n422\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.420\n>> Yeah, and\nthen you also gotta think it's-\n\n423\n00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.170\n>> If I'm buying a pizza or coffee,\n\n424\n00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:24.950\nwhatever they want.\n\n425\n00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.710\nCome on, help me out with my honor.\n\n426\n00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.346\n>> Yeah, you get that type.\n\n427\n00:24:28.346 --> 00:24:32.930\nAnd you get that, and\nthere still kind of standoffish a bit.\n\n428\n00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:38.020\nBut you also gotta think the fact\nthat if a lot of the times\n\n429\n00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.230\nyou know they're coming, they don't just\nrandomly appear and, hey we're here.\n\n430\n00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.360\nThat happens, but that's not the norm.\n\n431\n00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.170\nPeople know they're coming, so they know\nwhat their job is, to find problems.\n\n432\n00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:53.265\nNo one likes being criticized, and people\nare worried about what's gonna happen.\n\n433\n00:24:53.265 --> 00:24:56.810\nIt's gonna cost jobs, it's gonna go be a\nding against me am I not going to get that\n\n434\n00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.340\nraise, whatever, so it's not unheard of.\n\n435\n00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:04.360\nI've been in places where the boss pulls\npeople aside, and says, when an auditor\n\n436\n00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.950\ncomes in there, he says, watch what you\nsay around him and this type of stuff.\n\n437\n00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.740\nSo he's gotten used to that, that people\nare going to be standoffish towards him\n\n438\n00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.950\nand kind of almost\nostracized them from stuff.\n\n439\n00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.706\nI saw it happen before.\n\n440\n00:25:17.706 --> 00:25:21.350\nI mean, people have issues with\nthe IRS here in the States, of course.\n\n441\n00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:26.630\nBut I saw it happen years ago, and an IRS\nauditor came into one of the businesses.\n\n442\n00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:30.320\nI was working, and the boss goes,\nthe IRS is gonna be here this week.\n\n443\n00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.220\nHe says, make sure everything's clean.\n\n444\n00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.890\nAnd if he asks any questions,\ndon't answer him, go directly to me.\n\n445\n00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.920\nHe says, and if I'm not here,\nthen send him to this person, but\n\n446\n00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.900\nyou're not allowed to answer him.\n\n447\n00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.230\nHe went to everybody individually and\ntold them that to make sure.\n\n448\n00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:50.652\nAnd so, he was really,\nreally nervous about stuff.\n\n449\n00:25:50.652 --> 00:25:53.198\nDidn't have anything to worry about, but\n\n450\n00:25:53.198 --> 00:25:56.804\nhis philosophy was they're paying\nan auditor to come out and\n\n451\n00:25:56.804 --> 00:26:01.560\nfind a problem, so they pretty much have\nto find a problem to justify their job.\n\n452\n00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.536\nThat was his philosophy, very pessimistic.\n\n453\n00:26:03.536 --> 00:26:06.860\nThey were very, very,\nvery pessimistic on that.\n\n454\n00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.285\nSo, that was something that\nmade an impression on me.\n\n455\n00:26:09.285 --> 00:26:12.099\nIs that, some of these guy,\nyou just thought,\n\n456\n00:26:12.099 --> 00:26:14.140\nthey were just normal\nguys doing their job.\n\n457\n00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.720\nThe guy that was the auditor\ncoming in there,\n\n458\n00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.225\nwe started joking with my boss,\nit was like, oh.\n\n459\n00:26:19.225 --> 00:26:20.340\n[LAUGH] We started joking with him.\n\n460\n00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.258\n>> [LAUGH] Don't make friends with\nthe enemy, what are you doing Sean?\n\n461\n00:26:22.258 --> 00:26:22.780\n>> We're like, hey,\n\n462\n00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.120\nwe got some receipts here that we want\nyou to take a look at, and he didn't.\n\n463\n00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.509\nAnd the boss is just glaring.\n\n464\n00:26:26.509 --> 00:26:28.410\nAnd it's like, no, no, we're just kidding.\n\n465\n00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.630\nAnd the IRS guy was laughing about it.\n\n466\n00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.040\nHe thought it was funny, you know.\n\n467\n00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:36.170\nBut, some of them are like that,\nbut there is that kind of thing,\n\n468\n00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.025\nthat they're used to kind of that too,\nso, I don't know.\n\n469\n00:26:39.025 --> 00:26:40.380\n>> Very good, all right.\n\n470\n00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.860\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, that's gonna\ndo it for this particular episode.\n\n471\n00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.510\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n472\n00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.920\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n473\n00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.000\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n474\n00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.576\n>>

Rodrick.\n\n3\n00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.400\nWith me today is Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.141\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:16.907\n>> Doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:17.880\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.850\n>> Cannot complain.\n\n8\n00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.490\nWe're doing another episode in our\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner, so\n\n9\n00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.410\nI'm excited.\n\n10\n00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.460\nAnd in this one we're gonna be talking\nabout incident response framework.\n\n11\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.170\nSo, I guess first we need to start with,\nSean, first what the heck is an incident?\n\n12\n00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.320\n>> Something bad?\n\n13\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.770\n>> Easy enough.\n\n14\n00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.790\nMoving on.\n\n15\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.080\nAll right.\nHow do we respond to something bad?\n\n16\n00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.720\n>> Usually on a test\nthat's where you check\n\n17\n00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.260\nnot all of the above as you might think,\nbad.\n\n18\n00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.690\nWell I mean, [LAUGH] incident\ndoesn't have to be, honestly,\n\n19\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.380\nit doesn't have to be something\nthat's necessarily bad.\n\n20\n00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.700\nIf you kinda wanna peel away the whole\ngood and bad thing, what it is,\n\n21\n00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.840\nit's something that is an event that's not\nplanned for or outside normal operations.\n\n22\n00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.210\nIt's something that disrupts\nthose normal operations.\n\n23\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.390\nSo you've got your business\nworking one way and you've\n\n24\n00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.550\nlaid all these nice business processes and\nwhat have you and something happens to,\n\n25\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.280\nthat's outside the norm or\nbreaks that and now you've got a problem.\n\n26\n00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.790\nAnd so you've got to figure out how\nyou're gonna deal with that problem.\n\n27\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.260\nAnd like I said, incident doesn't\nnecessarily have to be something\n\n28\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.870\nthat was done just maliciously or bad.\n\n29\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.300\nIt could be something that just happens.\n\n30\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.470\nI mean you guys know how it is,\nwatching this.\n\n31\n00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.270\nI mean we've got a lot of people around\nhere, a lot of brain power that are in IT\n\n32\n00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.070\nbackgrounds and I mean, heck,\nit doesn't even have to be IT.\n\n33\n00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.270\nIt can be just in life in general.\n\n34\n00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.904\nSometimes, as the saying goes,\nwell, I can't use that one [LAUGH]\n\n35\n00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:52.200\n>> [LAUGH] Stuff happens,\n\n36\n00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.690\nis what we meant to say.\n\n37\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.490\nSo are we talking about things\nlike power failures, and\n\n38\n00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.230\nfloods, would those be incidents?\n\n39\n00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.550\n>> Anything,\nthey all classify as being disruptive.\n\n40\n00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.624\nIt could be that,\nit could be someone that's hacked in,\n\n41\n00:02:06.624 --> 00:02:10.608\nthere could be a problem someone's\nstolen something could be a problem.\n\n42\n00:02:10.608 --> 00:02:15.240\nSomething just isn't where it's\nsupposed to be and that's an issue too.\n\n43\n00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.460\nMaybe somebody didn't follow a procedure,\nthat could be a problem.\n\n44\n00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.620\nSo you've got things that\nare happening that are outside\n\n45\n00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.080\nthe way things are supposed to be done,\nthe way things are expected to happen.\n\n46\n00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.570\nSo, we have an incident.\n\n47\n00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.790\nHow do we deal with that,\nwhatever that incident is?\n\n48\n00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.100\nSo that's really as short\nas you really can get it,\n\n49\n00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.960\nit's something that's happened outside\nthe norm or wasn't planned for.\n\n50\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.929\n>> Right and so I guess a good thing to\nhave in place then would be some way to\n\n51\n00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:51.575\nhandle these cuz we've talked about in\nseveral shows where we don't make our best\n\n52\n00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:53.488\ndecisions during the incident.\n\n53\n00:02:53.488 --> 00:02:57.133\nA lot of times people get a little\nshaky and that's not what we want.\n\n54\n00:02:57.133 --> 00:03:01.103\n>> Yeah that's human nature is\nwhen the chips are down and\n\n55\n00:03:01.103 --> 00:03:06.798\nyou haven't planned for it or it's just\na really kind of overwhelming event,\n\n56\n00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:10.422\nyou can get a situation where people just,\nyeah,\n\n57\n00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:15.660\nthey don't necessarily make\ntheir best judgments there.\n\n58\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.660\nNow to be sure, it's not like\npeople start freaking out and\n\n59\n00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.941\nstart running around and doing the whole\nChicken Little routine and all that.\n\n60\n00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:28.120\nThat can definitely happen.\n\n61\n00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.000\nBut people may make a poor\ndecision they wouldn't\n\n62\n00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.900\nmake if they had looked back in hindsight\nor if they had time to think about it.\n\n63\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.550\nBut you can train people out of that.\n\n64\n00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.550\nThat's where your drills come in.\n\n65\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.530\nThose are where you have you have people\nthat are trained just maybe on paper,\n\n66\n00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.820\nyou have people that are doing\nmaybe read throughs of procedures,\n\n67\n00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.460\nall the way up to we're doing\nfull on simulations of things.\n\n68\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.250\nI mean you've probably seen\nit where they have these,\n\n69\n00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.220\nor heard of these drills at the very\nleast, where they simulate people\n\n70\n00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.060\nwith broken arms and\nblood spurting out and stuff like that.\n\n71\n00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.480\nThey will do that to really\nkind of freak people out.\n\n72\n00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.890\nThey'll have people kind of behind\nthem putting more pressure on them\n\n73\n00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.880\nto see how they'd react.\n\n74\n00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.490\nAnd the thing is is to kind of get them\nused to that so when the incident does\n\n75\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.580\nhappen it's something that they've dealt\nwith, and they can think about it.\n\n76\n00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.360\nWhat do I do?\n\n77\n00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.071\nIt's something that they've got\nacclimated to and all that.\n\n78\n00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:36.210\nSo you don't necessarily have\nto have people flipping out.\n\n79\n00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.510\nThat's always gonna happen,\nyou're have some degree of that,\n\n80\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.790\nthat people just don't\nreact well under pressure.\n\n81\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.730\nThey know that this is training over here\nand soon as you put them under any serious\n\n82\n00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:52.800\nfire, what now,\nthey don't know how to deal with it.\n\n83\n00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.640\nYou can mitigate a lot\nof that with training.\n\n84\n00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.211\n>> Mikala has a good question\nout of the chat room.\n\n85\n00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:02.969\nShe asks, if CASP or the Company Advanced\nSecurity Practice, do they differentiate\n\n86\n00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.473\nbetween a security event and a security\nincident, or is that kinda synonymous.\n\n87\n00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:08.611\n>> No they don't.\n\n88\n00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:09.609\nWhat's the next question?\n\n89\n00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:14.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, they really don't.\n\n90\n00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.400\nSecurity event, security incident, I know\nI've heard those ones broken up before.\n\n91\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.560\nAnd I kind of somewhat disagree with it.\n\n92\n00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.790\nBecause when you have a security event and\nincident, it's really just kind of\n\n93\n00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.120\nusing a different name for something.\n\n94\n00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.160\nYou're just changing it slightly, but\nit still refers to the same type of thing.\n\n95\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.870\nI like incident,\n\n96\n00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.580\njust because it fits in with other areas\nthat we use, people understand incident.\n\n97\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.680\nIt makes sense that we have incidence\nin other areas in disaster and\n\n98\n00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.480\nrecovery planning.\n\n99\n00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.240\nStuff like that that we're familiar with.\n\n100\n00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.380\nSo using that common\nterminology all the way through\n\n101\n00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.790\nis something that I'm a big fan of\ncuz I don't have to teach somebody.\n\n102\n00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.360\nIt's like, well it's event over here and\nover here it's called an incident.\n\n103\n00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.330\nAnd so you'll have people just\ntalking almost different languages\n\n104\n00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.980\nwhen they go in.\n\n105\n00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.660\nAnd that's never a good thing,\nespecially when you're in,\n\n106\n00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.270\ngoing back to what we just talked about,\na stressful environment.\n\n107\n00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.080\nI don't need people using different\nterminology, different labels.\n\n108\n00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.070\nSo, I'm a big fan of using,\nincident on, as far as the CASP goes.\n\n109\n00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.450\nThey are going to stick\nwith using incident.\n\n110\n00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.500\nI have not seen event used,\nat least in this context,\n\n111\n00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.180\nthat you're referring to in\nthe context of what CompTIA has,\n\n112\n00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.696\nthey will use the term event for\nother things.\n\n113\n00:06:33.696 --> 00:06:39.450\nBut if you peel away the security part of\nit and talk about an event or incident.\n\n114\n00:06:40.728 --> 00:06:43.850\nYeah, is there really any fundamental\ndifference between those terms really\n\n115\n00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.650\nwhen you get down to it.\n\n116\n00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.195\nThat's kind of the way I look at it.\n\n117\n00:06:46.195 --> 00:06:47.548\n>> Exactly.\n\n118\n00:06:47.548 --> 00:06:50.830\nAll right, well so\nSean incidents are nothing new.\n\n119\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.440\nI mean companies have been dealing\nwith these for some time so\n\n120\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.600\nthere's probably some good\nguidelines out there or some kind of\n\n121\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.420\nframework I guess to help us\ndevelop an incident response.\n\n122\n00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.745\n>> There are actually are a lot\nof them as you would imagine.\n\n123\n00:07:06.745 --> 00:07:08.910\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> There's a lot of them.\n\n124\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.900\nNow you can follow the really generic\nones, like I can't think off the top of\n\n125\n00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.300\nmy head right now,\njust drew a blank all of a sudden but\n\n126\n00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.060\nthe ones that CompTIA has like Security\nPlus and Network Plus, stuff like that.\n\n127\n00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.180\nThey have those, you can stick with those,\n\n128\n00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.250\nthey tend to be pretty generic,\nthey kinda tend to be a one size fits all.\n\n129\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.560\nThey work, but they're not gonna be\nthe best fit for every situation.\n\n130\n00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.523\nThey kind of try to be the end all,\ndo all for everything, but they do work.\n\n131\n00:07:38.523 --> 00:07:42.470\nThen you have ones that\nare customized to specific industries,\n\n132\n00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:47.075\nto specific situations and then if you're\nworking in kind of a multi kind of\n\n133\n00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:51.975\ndisciplinary environment where you have\nto coordinate with other partners and\n\n134\n00:07:51.975 --> 00:07:56.505\nstuff like that then that even changes\nit too, and if your industry's not\n\n135\n00:07:56.505 --> 00:08:01.185\nregulated They may have an incident\nresponse framework that takes place and\n\n136\n00:08:01.185 --> 00:08:05.910\nthere it'd say this is how you have to\nfollow, this is how this is reported.\n\n137\n00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.630\nI mean you could think about it if you're\n\n138\n00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.250\nin some of the power\ngeneration industries.\n\n139\n00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:17.410\nThink about the fact that how is your\nincident response is going to look like\n\n140\n00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:24.670\nif you are in a situation where\nthey are doing a nuclear power.\n\n141\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.090\nYeah, that's not goinna\nbe a standard incident.\n\n142\n00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.530\nIt's gonna be something that is dependent\non what's reported, they're going to have\n\n143\n00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.370\na documented dfferent response\npolicies and protocols to follow.\n\n144\n00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.010\nThey're going to go through and say, Okay,\nwell this is a little more serious one.\n\n145\n00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.450\nAnd we have to notify people.\n\n146\n00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.830\nThere's a fire somewhere on\nthe grounds of the facilities,\n\n147\n00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.520\nthere's gonna be something to follow.\n\n148\n00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.830\nAnd it's not uncommon to see those\ndifferent types of procedures.\n\n149\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.430\nYou see it in the medical field, as\n\n150\n00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.880\nsome of you may be aware that's in medical\nfield, they actually have things called\n\n151\n00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.050\nprotocols that specifically say what's\nsupposed to be done in certain situations.\n\n152\n00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:09.690\nIf you have a Chief of Medicine or\n\n153\n00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.150\nat a clinic or a hospital and\nsomething happens,\n\n154\n00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.780\nthere is going to be a protocol in\nplace that has to be followed and\n\n155\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.480\nhe's going to tell the different\ndepartments that are involved.\n\n156\n00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.000\nWell you know you need to do this,\nthis and this.\n\n157\n00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.390\nAnd get this information from so\nand so and move this.\n\n158\n00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.900\nAnd he's got his master check list to make\nsure that people have been notified and\n\n159\n00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.840\nthings are being tripped off.\n\n160\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.490\nAnd then your gonna see the departments\nhave their own thingsthat they have to\n\n161\n00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.730\nreport back and coordinate and make sure\nthat stuff is being done at their level.\n\n162\n00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.840\nSo there's a lot of little procedures that\ncould happen, some of them are accustomed\n\n163\n00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.640\nto a specific business,\nsome are specific to a certain industry.\n\n164\n00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.440\nAnd some of the are you know some\nof them in the case of medical,\n\n165\n00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.703\nthey're down to a specific facility or\neven a county.\n\n166\n00:09:55.703 --> 00:10:00.470\nWhen I went through my\ntraining to be an EMT and\n\n167\n00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.060\nI was going on to look\nat being a paramedic.\n\n168\n00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.730\nThe stuff in there, they acquainted you\nwith, they said hey, there's stuff we're\n\n169\n00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.430\ngonna teach you during training,\nthere's stuff when you go out on calls.\n\n170\n00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.830\nBut there's also gonna be\nstuff that we can't teach you.\n\n171\n00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:20.290\nWhen you go to some of these communities,\nthey will have their own protocols.\n\n172\n00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.240\nAn ambulance service or a clinic or\nsomething works there and\n\n173\n00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.600\nsomeone's got in some sort of incident\nout in the road, traffic accident or\n\n174\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.000\nis having some sort of problem.\n\n175\n00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.980\nOr you suspect there's some\nsort of communicable disease or\n\n176\n00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.900\nsomething involved.\n\n177\n00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.640\nThere's a procedure involved for\nthat that has to be followed.\n\n178\n00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.530\nThey happen to call it protocols, but\nsix on one and half a dozen on the other,\n\n179\n00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.890\nit's the same type of thing that there's\nsomething specific to that situation in\n\n180\n00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.090\nthat industry.\n\n181\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:50.600\nEvery place that deals has a normal way of\noperating, an expectation of a certain way\n\n182\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:56.120\nof operating, typically has more than\none way to respond to incidents.\n\n183\n00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.370\nThey follow a similar process,\nwhere you detect it.\n\n184\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.780\nYou see if you have a valid incident,\nthen you report it.\n\n185\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.420\nAnd then from there it may go to\ncontainment and seeing once you contain\n\n186\n00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.270\nit, if it's something that can be cleaned\nup or if it needs to be further analyzed.\n\n187\n00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.520\nAnd then it will be even towards the end\nof postmortem where they figure out okay,\n\n188\n00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.640\nwhat happened, why did it happen,\nand what can we do better?\n\n189\n00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.425\nI guess we're postmortem in medical,\nthat's probably not a good thing.\n\n190\n00:11:25.425 --> 00:11:28.020\n[LAUGH]\n>> And that's actually a great segue in,\n\n191\n00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.870\ncuz that was gonna be\nmy next question was,\n\n192\n00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:34.260\nI know there's gonna be specific\nincident response policies for\n\n193\n00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.210\ndifferent industries and things like that,\nbut there's probably some standardization.\n\n194\n00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.580\nLike you mentioned a few different phases.\n\n195\n00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.350\nThat's probably common to most policies?\n\n196\n00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:44.890\n>> Yeah.\n\n197\n00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:49.820\nThere tends to be a certain level\nthat if you really got down to it and\n\n198\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.900\nlooked at it you'd see that\nthere's some commonality\n\n199\n00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.909\nabout how things are communicated and\nstuff like that.\n\n200\n00:11:57.065 --> 00:12:01.600\nBut, in fact used to have\nto really look for it.\n\n201\n00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:08.290\nNowadays agencies are trying to get\nmore of that common verbage, more\n\n202\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:13.240\nof a standardized framework across the\nboard because there's been these problems\n\n203\n00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.400\nin the past where in the common verbage\nand you didn't have standards being used.\n\n204\n00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.290\nYou had people that couldn't communicate,\nand it was causing frustration.\n\n205\n00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.210\nIt was definitely slowing\ndown response times.\n\n206\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:29.560\nEspecially here in the States,\nthey've got things for\n\n207\n00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.970\nFEMA, Department of Homeland Security,\nstuff like that.\n\n208\n00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.150\nThey've done a lot towards\nstandardizing that.\n\n209\n00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:41.719\nI remember talking in one of\nthe other recordings we did\n\n210\n00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.200\nfor forensics, I was talking about when\nthe instant response motivations that they\n\n211\n00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.130\nhad to show why they want to establish\nstandardization across industries.\n\n212\n00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.380\nAnd people that may work together because\n\n213\n00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.680\nthey want to make sure\neveryone's on the same page.\n\n214\n00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.950\nI was talking about that incident,\n\n215\n00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:04.480\nwhere they had a police officer backed\nup by the guys at the National Guard.\n\n216\n00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.430\nThey were telling them, cover me.\n\n217\n00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.400\nThat is the term cover me,\nmeans two different things.\n\n218\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.930\nIt means one thing in\nthe civilian world and\n\n219\n00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:14.600\nit means something in the military world.\n\n220\n00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.410\nCivilian world it means you know how you\nget your weapons raised in case someone\n\n221\n00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:18.870\ntakes a shot at one of your buddies.\n\n222\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.720\nIn the military world,\n\n223\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.550\neveryone's spraying gunfire all over\nthe place as soon as you say that.\n\n224\n00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:28.610\nSo if you got those two\ngroups working together,\n\n225\n00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:33.480\nwhich they were in this case,\nthe civilian agency that was in charge.\n\n226\n00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.120\nThey've got this other\ngroup backing them up.\n\n227\n00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.330\nAnd they said, hey cover me.\n\n228\n00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.780\nYou know, the cops are expecting,\n\n229\n00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.600\noh well these guys are going to pull\nout their weapons and keep an eye out.\n\n230\n00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.110\nMake sure that no one's trying to,\nto pick us off.\n\n231\n00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.290\nNo these guys are like oh cool,\nwe're waiting for this.\n\n232\n00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.490\nYou know. [LAUGH] >> They just\npull out their weapons and\n\n233\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.070\nstart spraying bullets all over the place.\n\n234\n00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.440\n>> Suppression fire all across the place.\n\n235\n00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.790\n>> They said before they stopped\nthem in that case they had\n\n236\n00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.823\nfired close to 200 rounds or\nsomething like that.\n\n237\n00:14:00.823 --> 00:14:03.769\n[LAUGH]\n>> We're waiting for this man.\n\n238\n00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:07.930\nSo I mean that's something that's one of\nthe things that specific incident in fact\n\n239\n00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:14.700\nwas one of the ones that was cited towards\ngetting more standardization in place.\n\n240\n00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.250\nYou need to be able to\nspeak the same language.\n\n241\n00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:21.950\nAs far as the whole\ninstant response stuff,\n\n242\n00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:26.040\naside from the verbage and all that.\n\n243\n00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.510\nSomething that you can actually look at if\nyou really want to go down this road and\n\n244\n00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.960\nsee what they've done in that area,\nis they have an incident command system\n\n245\n00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.830\nhere that FEMA's developed in conjunction\nwith other agencies, civilian,\n\n246\n00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.500\nmilitary, and otherwise.\n\n247\n00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.280\nTo make sure they're all on the same page,\nand\n\n248\n00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.240\nthat's rapidly becoming, or\nhas become in many cases, the standard.\n\n249\n00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.670\nCuz what they wanna be able to do is,\nthey wanna be able to\n\n250\n00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:58.650\nbe able to pull people from wherever and\ntask them with helping in assisting, and\n\n251\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:05.050\nthey want them to just be pulled from\nwherever they are and dropped in.\n\n252\n00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:11.212\nI can sign myself as an example of that,\nI've got a rating for\n\n253\n00:15:11.212 --> 00:15:15.810\nemergency management, so\ni'm actually considered the rating.\n\n254\n00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.100\nWhatever that is worth.\n\n255\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.340\nIt's considered to be\na master rating in itself.\n\n256\n00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.110\nI can technically,\nif you wanted to,which is really scary.\n\n257\n00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.726\nIf they had a Katrina or\n\n258\n00:15:23.726 --> 00:15:28.380\na nuclear reactor go off,\nthey could call me in to manage it.\n\n259\n00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.490\nYou should really leave\nthe planet at that point.\n\n260\n00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.351\nI'm just saying.\n\n261\n00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:38.555\nThe fast thing about it is,\nall kidding aside,\n\n262\n00:15:38.555 --> 00:15:42.317\nthe fast end thing about it is\nthat when you look at that,\n\n263\n00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:46.803\nthe structure that the federal\ngovernment here has put in place and\n\n264\n00:15:46.803 --> 00:15:51.450\ndeveloped with all these agencies and\nis actually giving funding and\n\n265\n00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:56.293\nmaking the courses available for\nfree to get everyone trained up on it.\n\n266\n00:15:56.293 --> 00:16:00.433\nIs really gone a long way towards really\nmaking it more cohesive more rapid\n\n267\n00:16:00.433 --> 00:16:01.790\nresponse to things.\n\n268\n00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.605\nThere's very little of this,\nhey what are you talking about now?\n\n269\n00:16:04.605 --> 00:16:07.580\nYeah, you have to learn a new system,\nthat's different than what you had.\n\n270\n00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.130\nBut everyone has to do that at some point,\nso get everyone on the same page and just\n\n271\n00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:15.310\ngive them refresher training and do drills\nand all that and it works a lot better.\n\n272\n00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.540\nSo if you ever want to see that,\nyou can look up FEMA and ICS,\n\n273\n00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:24.130\nincident command system, and you'll\nsee there's a bunch of course on that.\n\n274\n00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.790\nAnd in fact with FEMA there's online\ncourses with it that are just\n\n275\n00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:33.560\na little flash based things that\nwalk you through this stuff.\n\n276\n00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.530\nAnd you can see what they're\ndoing at that level, and\n\n277\n00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.030\nthat actually may help you give another\nunderstanding of what we're talking about\n\n278\n00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:43.680\nhere if you're working in the big\nwide world outside a company.\n\n279\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.020\nSo a fascinating thing.\n\n280\n00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.710\nBut, there is,\nto get back to the core issue,\n\n281\n00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.920\nthere is a level of standardization\nthat they try to adhere to, and\n\n282\n00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:57.145\nthat's becoming more and more prevalent\nas they realize having everyone kind of\n\n283\n00:16:57.145 --> 00:17:02.140\nroll their own solution as they\nsaw fit was good, in some senses.\n\n284\n00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.230\nOther senses, not really cutting it.\n\n285\n00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.660\n>> These phases, they have names?\n\n286\n00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:14.230\nI heard you mention the detection phase\nand the, like, what do we have to know?\n\n287\n00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:20.210\n>> Well, what I would say for here,\nwe talked about instant response before.\n\n288\n00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:26.510\nFor earlier on in the course,\nwe had the talk about different steps.\n\n289\n00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:32.010\nYou really just kind of got, the big thing\nyou've gotta understand is at this point\n\n290\n00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:37.010\nyou can go back and look at\nthe earlier episode we did on this.\n\n291\n00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.870\nIn the CASP it talked about it.\n\n292\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.480\nBut what you've got to take away here,\nwe'll assume you've kind of got that down.\n\n293\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.570\nWhat here you've got the understand,\n\n294\n00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:49.650\nwhat's the significance of those steps\nare, and the name probably says it all.\n\n295\n00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.380\nLike I said if you go through it,\n\n296\n00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.070\nthere's a preparation phase where you're\nready to go and you're trained up,\n\n297\n00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.230\nyou've got your tool kits and\nall that fancy stuff ready to go.\n\n298\n00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:04.280\nAnd then you have your detection where you\nfind out that something is ocurring and\n\n299\n00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.640\nthen you start moving on to\nthings like containing it and\n\n300\n00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.340\nmaybe doing analysis and eradicating.\n\n301\n00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:17.720\nAnd going right on through to the point\nwhere you are doing that post-mortem.\n\n302\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.150\nAnd heck, even between the time you\neradicate it and do your post-mortem,\n\n303\n00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:26.140\nyou have a recovery slash repair phase\nwhere you're bringing stuff back and\n\n304\n00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:31.440\nrestoring data and systems and doing what\nyou have to to get a workable system back.\n\n305\n00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.670\nAnd then your report goes out.\n\n306\n00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.630\nSo it's pretty much standardized\naround a model like that.\n\n307\n00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.210\nOne of the things you've\nseen over the last,\n\n308\n00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.670\nyou know I wanna say almost over the last\ndecade, at least in the IT area and\n\n309\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.440\nsecurity area, you've seen these\ndifferent kind of developments of that.\n\n310\n00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.960\nBut if you really kinda stepped back for\na moment and looked at it.\n\n311\n00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.230\nYou saw that they're kinda\nsaying the same thing.\n\n312\n00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:58.720\nIt's just like one vendor decided well\nI don't wanna look like those guys so\n\n313\n00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.340\nI'm gonna make myself look unique\nby calling it something different.\n\n314\n00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.410\nSo they've kinda started to move\naway from that saying okay well.\n\n315\n00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:12.420\nHere's what the incident response\nprocess does and here's some steps and\n\n316\n00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.530\neveryone is starting to agree\nupon what those steps are.\n\n317\n00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.200\nThey're starting to consolidate steps.\n\n318\n00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.810\nI mean I used to see them where\nthere was a five step process and\n\n319\n00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:25.130\nyou go across to another vendor and\nthere was like a nine step process there.\n\n320\n00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.270\nIt was just ridiculous.\n\n321\n00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:32.170\nI can't even speak, I can't even get\nclose to speaking the same language.\n\n322\n00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.090\nAnd you got half the steps that I do,\n\n323\n00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:38.390\nand there's only a few that actually\ntranslate directly over that I can see.\n\n324\n00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.460\nSo now you have to break\ndown their process and\n\n325\n00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.210\nfigure out where are you gonna\nshove in the rest of this stuff.\n\n326\n00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:44.900\nWhich may not even matter.\n\n327\n00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:50.770\nSo they're trying to standardize as much\nas possible to make it more efficient.\n\n328\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.610\nIf you're inside a single company,\n\n329\n00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.890\nwho cares if you've got\na standardized process.\n\n330\n00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.170\nYou know,\nthat's one thing to kind of think about.\n\n331\n00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.758\nAnd I'm kinda being a little bit bold and\ncavalier about saying it's like [SOUND],\n\n332\n00:20:00.758 --> 00:20:03.056\nwho cares,\nif you've got a standardized process.\n\n333\n00:20:03.056 --> 00:20:06.956\nThat's the line of thinking in a lot of\ncases that well, heck, if it's all in\n\n334\n00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:11.110\nthe family, it's all inside the walls\nof this company I can do what I want.\n\n335\n00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.950\nOkay, if you wanna do that, that's fine,\nbut do remember that you may,\n\n336\n00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:18.950\nif you have to work with someone\non the outside at any point\n\n337\n00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.770\nthen standardization is\ngonna go a long way.\n\n338\n00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.740\n>> Yeah, it really does allow\nus to have that interactivity,\n\n339\n00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.200\nespecially during a crisis situation, so.\n\n340\n00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.960\nWhich I guess really it does explain\nwhy we have a process in the first\n\n341\n00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.450\nplace, right?\n\n342\n00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:34.010\n>> Yep.\n\n343\n00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.670\nA process is to make sure we have, and\n\n344\n00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.760\nyou can think about this with auditing,\nremember what we said with auditing.\n\n345\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.530\nWe want to have,\nwe want to be able to check and\n\n346\n00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.400\nmake sure things are happening\nthe way that they are supposed to be.\n\n347\n00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.610\nIf you have a process,\nyou have a checklist.\n\n348\n00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.930\nYou've got something you can follow.\n\n349\n00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.960\nYou've got a protocol that you can go\nthrough and boom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n350\n00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.630\nIf you have those things\nwritten down on your tablet.\n\n351\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.770\nWhich they're doing a lot more of now.\n\n352\n00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:03.510\nThey're doing those ruggedized devices\nthat they can carry out into the field.\n\n353\n00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:07.450\nHaving those types of things goes a long\nway towards making sure it's done\n\n354\n00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.580\nconsistently.\n\n355\n00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.110\nI'm not a big fan of someone just\n\n356\n00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.770\nmemorizing these steps going,\nokay, I got it.\n\n357\n00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:22.250\nFocus on what's supposed to be done and\nthat and have those things for\n\n358\n00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.510\na check list.\n\n359\n00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.920\nDon't waste brain power on going,\nokay this, you know,\n\n360\n00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.640\nknow where you are, of course.\n\n361\n00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.270\nBut don't go crazy with it use these other\nthings to have that, you know nearby and\n\n362\n00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.050\nfocus on specifically okay these\nare the things that, you know,\n\n363\n00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:36.710\nthat need to get done.\n\n364\n00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.770\nJust go through that checklist, okay I\nknow what specifically what that means.\n\n365\n00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.950\nI know what specifically what\nthat bullet point means.\n\n366\n00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.150\nI can go right on through make sure\nthat things are being handled.\n\n367\n00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.211\n>> All right, good,\nyou got any examples for us?\n\n368\n00:21:47.211 --> 00:21:48.741\nYou know I love listening to your stories.\n\n369\n00:21:48.741 --> 00:21:53.419\n[LAUGH]\n>> There's endless examples of\n\n370\n00:21:53.419 --> 00:21:58.610\nincidence response framework in place.\n\n371\n00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.190\nThere are just tons of them.\n\n372\n00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.100\n>> FEMA, you mentioned that one.\n\n373\n00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.780\n>> Yeah, FEMA's got a bunch of ones.\n\n374\n00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:09.780\nThere's other ones,\nother places out there that have them,\n\n375\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.010\nand the thing I'll tell you is, with\nInstant Response, one of the things that\n\n376\n00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:18.410\ncan be kind of scary,\nthere's really no other way to put it.\n\n377\n00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:23.070\nIt is kind of scary is the fact\nthat instant response,\n\n378\n00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:28.320\nit's something that is a perishable skill.\n\n379\n00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.590\nIf you don't constantly train at it and\nbe aware of it.\n\n380\n00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.930\nIf you don't do that, and\nyou're not aware of it and\n\n381\n00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.180\nyou're not trained on it,\nthose skills will go away.\n\n382\n00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.630\nAnd what happens is that when bad stuff\nhappens, which is what is gonna occur,\n\n383\n00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.260\nbad stuff's gonna happen,\nyou're gonna panic.\n\n384\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.490\nCase in point is with this\nincident response framework.\n\n385\n00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.270\nI saw you put it up there, did I miss it?\n\n386\n00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.970\nDid you put it up there?\n\n387\n00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.100\n>> Yeah, for FEMA and for the US.\n\n388\n00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.860\n>> Oh, yeah, there it is.\n\n389\n00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.920\nOkay.\n\n390\n00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:03.190\nThe instant response framework here,\nat one point, this was like about four or\n\n391\n00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:07.760\nfive years ago it was quoted that since\nthey developed that whole framework and\n\n392\n00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.470\nbrought it up online here and started\nreally disseminating that information.\n\n393\n00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.620\nThere was only I think one case where\nit was ever done 100% by the book.\n\n394\n00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:19.200\n>> Oh, really?\n>> Yeah, done perfectly textbook stuff.\n\n395\n00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.900\nIn that situation, I think it was down in\n\n396\n00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:31.515\nNew Orleans where there was one\nof these incidents that they had\n\n397\n00:23:31.515 --> 00:23:37.865\nwhere an elderly person hit the wrong\npedal or something in there and\n\n398\n00:23:37.865 --> 00:23:42.150\nplowed into a group of people and\ncaused a lot of injuries and stuff.\n\n399\n00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:47.605\nWell, what happened is\nsomeone that was there,\n\n400\n00:23:47.605 --> 00:23:53.601\nthat was trained on this,\ntook control of the thing.\n\n401\n00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:56.793\nThey just went in and was telling\nthe police and fire departments,\n\n402\n00:23:56.793 --> 00:23:59.365\nokay I need you guys to go over here,\nyou guys do this.\n\n403\n00:23:59.365 --> 00:24:00.793\nThis is going to be the green zone.\n\n404\n00:24:00.793 --> 00:24:06.691\nThe yellow zone, the red zone and they\nkept just going through the things and\n\n405\n00:24:06.691 --> 00:24:11.487\ntelling people they just apparently\nliterally just hopped on\n\n406\n00:24:11.487 --> 00:24:15.700\ntop of the hood of an SUV and\nthen got in the top of it.\n\n407\n00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.400\nIt was kind of a way to just go\nokay you do this, this and this.\n\n408\n00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.410\nAnd then the commandeered a balcony\noverlooking the scene and\n\n409\n00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.850\nthey got a dry erase board and\nthey were diagramming this stuff out.\n\n410\n00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:31.310\nWell, the fire chief comes on scene and\nsees that when this guy\n\n411\n00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:36.600\nhappened to be there and at part of\nthis event and was doing that and\n\n412\n00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:41.010\napparently the fire chief came in and\nhe comes in the events.\n\n413\n00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:45.481\nHe finds out who's in charge of it and\nthey said the fire chief standing there,\n\n414\n00:24:45.481 --> 00:24:46.240\ngoing okay.\n\n415\n00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.690\nHe is looking at everything.\n\n416\n00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.580\nHe is the guy that's supposed\nto be ranking on the scene.\n\n417\n00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.455\nHe just showed up.\n\n418\n00:24:51.455 --> 00:24:52.925\nHe's supposed to be taking over control.\n\n419\n00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:55.665\nTo his credit the guy that was doing it,\nhe saw it.\n\n420\n00:24:55.665 --> 00:24:58.925\nThe guy was doing it exactly,\nhe had everything under control and\n\n421\n00:24:58.925 --> 00:25:00.850\nwas allocating his resources and\neverything.\n\n422\n00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.845\nThis fire chief shows up with his\nadditional resources in there and\n\n423\n00:25:03.845 --> 00:25:06.155\nhe sees all this stuff and\nsays, sounds pretty good.\n\n424\n00:25:06.155 --> 00:25:09.225\nWhat do you need me to do?\n\n425\n00:25:09.225 --> 00:25:12.975\n>> Wow.\n>> The thing I'm saying about this,\n\n426\n00:25:12.975 --> 00:25:19.580\nthe thing to kind of add to this\nis knowing it is really important.\n\n427\n00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.400\nExperience is also\na really important thing.\n\n428\n00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.910\nThe person that did this,\nI think he was really careful\n\n429\n00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:27.166\nnot to really make a big deal\nabout who the person was.\n\n430\n00:25:27.166 --> 00:25:32.220\nBut now to kinda say\nabout who the person was,\n\n431\n00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.010\nthe person that did it was\nlike a 19 year old fire cadet.\n\n432\n00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.790\nThe guy had, I think it was like a 17\nyear old fire cadet, is what it was.\n\n433\n00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.470\n>> Wow.\n>> He was gonna be,\n\n434\n00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:45.110\nI guess he's a firemen now, but he had\nspent time around the fire department and\n\n435\n00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.840\nstuff like that, and\nhe just happened to be there and he\n\n436\n00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:54.120\njust had gone through the stuff, had been\nreviewing it, had been prepped for it.\n\n437\n00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.240\nAnd he just saw the incident happen,\nsaid somebody needs to do it.\n\n438\n00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.340\nI gotta coordinate these things.\n\n439\n00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.140\nHe just jumps up there says okay,\nyou're gonna be doing this,\n\n440\n00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.750\nyou're going to be doing this,\nokay get over here.\n\n441\n00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.690\nGive me a report on how many injuries\nhave and how many casualties that were,\n\n442\n00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.580\njust snapped right in and\neverything snapped into place.\n\n443\n00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:12.190\nHe's the only one at that point in time\nwho had ever done it 100% correctly, and\n\n444\n00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.310\nthat's why this fire chief came on scene,\nsaw it and\n\n445\n00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:16.360\nsays, what do you need me to do?\n\n446\n00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.290\nHe said this is your scene.\n\n447\n00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.010\nNo you got it.\n\n448\n00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.993\nWhere do you need me?\n\n449\n00:26:19.993 --> 00:26:23.930\nAnd the guy says I need\nyour resources over here.\n\n450\n00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:27.990\nHe says okay, gone.\n\n451\n00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.670\nIt was very impressive.\n\n452\n00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.700\nThe guy, that 17 year old,\nnow is doing something.\n\n453\n00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.840\nObviously with that type of skill and\n\n454\n00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.210\nthat kind of coolness under fire,\nhe moved up pretty quickly.\n\n455\n00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:44.330\nHe works with FEMA doing that\nsort of training now, and\n\n456\n00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:49.473\nI believe he has actually, he does\nfirefighting now too, but he was that\n\n457\n00:26:49.473 --> 00:26:54.470\nproficient and it clicked for him that\nwere like, here is the guy who did it.\n\n458\n00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:57.480\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n459\n00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.832\nAlright.\nWell Sean, again.\n\n460\n00:26:58.832 --> 00:27:03.140\nA lot of great information there talking\nabout incident response framework and\n\n461\n00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.800\nhow important that is to have that\nin place before incidents occur.\n\n462\n00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.070\nMake sure everybody's trained up on it and\nthat they maintain that training cuz\n\n463\n00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.090\nit's something that if we don't use,\nwe lose it.\n\n464\n00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:18.053\nWe've got to stay on our A game for\nwhen those incidences and\n\n465\n00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:20.782\nthere's plenty of help out there.\n\n466\n00:27:20.782 --> 00:27:23.425\nIf you need to come up with\nan incidence response policy,\n\n467\n00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:26.470\nthere's that framework we can use,\nwe can look at the US government for\n\n468\n00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:31.410\nexample or FEMA to get an idea of\nhow to we need to structure that.\n\n469\n00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.500\nSo anything else Sean we want to talk\nabout with our incidence response?\n\n470\n00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.080\n>> Yeah, since you mentioned the federal\ngovernment, I was mentioning it too.\n\n471\n00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.807\nI saw Makayla put in that first.org.\n\n472\n00:27:41.807 --> 00:27:47.150\nI guess we should ask her if that's the UK\nversion of what we're talking about,\n\n473\n00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:48.530\ncuz I know she's over there.\n\n474\n00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.190\nIf that's something else they're using for\nthere,\n\n475\n00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.530\nI guess she can see if it's that too.\n\n476\n00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.800\nYeah, I know we've got that one here,\nI am not familiar with\n\n477\n00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:07.180\nwhat it is in other countries, but I-\n>> I think it's a global organization.\n\n478\n00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.180\n>> Okay.\n\n479\n00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:12.382\nSo there's other stuff in place, too.\n\n480\n00:28:12.382 --> 00:28:14.510\n>> Very good.\n\n481\n00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.900\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n482\n00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.170\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n483\n00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:21.220\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n484\n00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.310\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n485\n00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:27.970\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.371\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:15.950\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.970\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.092\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.092 --> 00:00:20.056\n>> I'm doing fantastic,\nexcited to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:22.230\nWe got another great\nepisode coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.570\nWe're continuing our CompTIA Advanced\nSecurity Practitioner series.\n\n10\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.800\nIn this episode Sean, we're gonna\nbe talking about digital forensics.\n\n11\n00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.730\nGood stuff here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.068\nA little more exciting,\nif you've been watching them in order.\n\n13\n00:00:34.068 --> 00:00:37.900\nYou've seen all our auditing,\nand our policies and\n\n14\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.920\nprocedures episodes at this point.\n\n15\n00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.930\nNow, we get to talk\nabout digital forensics.\n\n16\n00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.310\n>> If you're watching them out of order\nI don't know what's wrong with you.\n\n17\n00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.386\nGo back and do it the right way.\n\n18\n00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:49.764\n>> [LAUGH] So\ndefinitely something you know we've seen,\n\n19\n00:00:49.764 --> 00:00:54.730\nwe've got entire episodes or courses\nthat we've done on digital forensics.\n\n20\n00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.410\nIt's a big part of security,\nand we're seeing more and\n\n21\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.180\nmore organizations keep some\nof that in house, right?\n\n22\n00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.700\nOr actually have people on\nstaff that are trained in this.\n\n23\n00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.420\nAt least do the initial incident response.\n\n24\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.600\n>> Yeah, I'd say either gonna have someone\non staff, or which is still actually\n\n25\n00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.180\nsomewhat not, it's becoming a little\nmore common, but it's not there yet.\n\n26\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.380\nIt's more likely that you have someone\ntrained in that first responder role,\n\n27\n00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.540\nthat's a forensically aware person,\nit's kind of the way I would phrase it.\n\n28\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.320\nBecause you still may be a company that\ncontracts on the outside party to do that,\n\n29\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.496\nand they're kind of like,\nyou got the bat phone, right.\n\n30\n00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:39.972\nYou call them and whatever, and\nthey're sending out the signal,\n\n31\n00:01:39.972 --> 00:01:42.092\nwhatever, and bring them in to do that.\n\n32\n00:01:42.092 --> 00:01:48.810\nBut on your part, as a company, you need\nto have someone that's forensically aware.\n\n33\n00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.990\nIf you recall,\n\n34\n00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.100\nif you've watched the forensics course,\nwe talked about the first responder role.\n\n35\n00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.180\nThat first responder is someone\nthat has certain responsibilities,\n\n36\n00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.990\nespecially in the context\nthat we're talking here.\n\n37\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.800\nThere's certain things they have as\nfar as preserving the scene, and\n\n38\n00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.410\ndocumenting who's there,\nand taking control of it.\n\n39\n00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.720\nAnd making sure there's no interaction\nwith that scene until forensic personnel\n\n40\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.010\nget there, so they are definitely\npart of the forensic process.\n\n41\n00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.741\nSo why an organization may not have\na justification to have a forensics person\n\n42\n00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:25.834\non staff yet, it's not a bad idea to have\na first responder understands if there's\n\n43\n00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:30.824\na security incident or something that\nneeds to be preserved for forensic techs.\n\n44\n00:02:30.824 --> 00:02:35.002\nThey know who to call, and they know\nspecifically when their forensic person\n\n45\n00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:38.600\ntells, hey preserve the scene,\ngive me some names and numbers and\n\n46\n00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.780\ntake control of things until I'm there,\nand I'm about an hour out.\n\n47\n00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.000\nThey are aware of that, but as you said,\nthere are more organizations\n\n48\n00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.440\nthat are getting forensic people, and\nyou can kind of pick who's doing that.\n\n49\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.458\nIt's gonna be almost across the board,\nyou'll see financial industries\n\n50\n00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:03.770\nthat will do that, just considering\nwhat they have on the line.\n\n51\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.730\nThey will have a trained forensic\npersonnel, there may not be a lot of them.\n\n52\n00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.360\nI saw some pretty large financial\nagencies that only have maybe two or\n\n53\n00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.940\nthree people that are trained in\nthat role, but that's all they need.\n\n54\n00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.190\nThose people have additional\nresponsibilities.\n\n55\n00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.112\nI mean I know one that's actually kinda\nharkening back to something we talked\n\n56\n00:03:24.112 --> 00:03:25.329\nabout in this section.\n\n57\n00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.869\nThe guy actually does forensic accounting,\nbut\n\n58\n00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:33.309\nhe also does digital forensics too.\n\n59\n00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:37.260\nHe's trained in that, so\nhe's got two things that he's working on.\n\n60\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.950\nPlus, he does some stuff in audits,\n\n61\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.060\nwhich kind of fits in this\nsame area of expertise.\n\n62\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.320\nBut he does have a,\nhe's one of three forensic people,\n\n63\n00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.340\nthat do digital forensics specifically.\n\n64\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.180\n>> Now when we look at\nan organization like that,\n\n65\n00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.130\nthat maybe has that in person\nforensics investigator.\n\n66\n00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.520\nYou said like financial\nthey typically do that.\n\n67\n00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.020\nIs that because the information\nthat they have is so\n\n68\n00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.440\nsensitive that they would rather\nkeep it in house if they can,\n\n69\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.620\nthan to bring somebody from the outside\nand have to worry about non-disclosures,\n\n70\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.070\nand all of those other regulations\nthat might be in place.\n\n71\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.394\n>> That's definitely gonna be\na big part of it, absolutely.\n\n72\n00:04:13.394 --> 00:04:16.755\nIt's good that they do have some\nsensitivity information, and now if\n\n73\n00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:21.135\nthey have an outside agency, there's\nadditional things they've gotta consider.\n\n74\n00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:24.163\nIt doesn't mean that, that doesn't\nhappen that they have an outside agency.\n\n75\n00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:28.367\nIt just means that,\nyou kind of hit the nail on the head,\n\n76\n00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:33.744\nby having forensic personnel internally,\nthey can respond quicker.\n\n77\n00:04:33.744 --> 00:04:35.670\nThey have a lot more flexibility.\n\n78\n00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.210\nAnd then they don't have\nnecessarily that PII issue, and\n\n79\n00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.550\nother stuff to concern themselves with.\n\n80\n00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.510\n>> Familiarity with\nthe systems probably as well.\n\n81\n00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.500\n>> That's definitely gonna help.\n\n82\n00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.820\nThe agency I know that does that,\nit's a financial agency, but\n\n83\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:59.160\nit's part of,\nit's controlled by the state.\n\n84\n00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.177\nBut what they do is they have these\nforensically trained personnel,\n\n85\n00:05:04.177 --> 00:05:09.713\nand they have the ability, if they have\nsomebody they need to investigate,\n\n86\n00:05:09.713 --> 00:05:13.964\nthey can go in any time of the day,\nyou know if they need to.\n\n87\n00:05:13.964 --> 00:05:16.872\nSo if they need to be there at two in\nthe morning when they know no one else is\n\n88\n00:05:16.872 --> 00:05:18.899\ngonna be there,\nthey have the ability to do that.\n\n89\n00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:21.945\nThey can check logs and\nstuff like that a lot easier.\n\n90\n00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:23.705\nThen they also have you know,\n\n91\n00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:29.310\nvaults that they control with, if\nsomeone high up leaves the organization.\n\n92\n00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.440\nThey know the procedures for\npulling stuff out.\n\n93\n00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.430\nThey are only ones authorized for that.\n\n94\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.600\nSo, if the director of the agency leaves,\nthey know to pull the hard drive out and\n\n95\n00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.710\nwhat to preserve, just in case\nthere ever is an investigation.\n\n96\n00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.834\nSo they're a lot closer to stuff and\nknow how things work.\n\n97\n00:05:46.834 --> 00:05:50.562\nAnd since they're regulated pretty\nheavily, you know that you have\n\n98\n00:05:50.562 --> 00:05:54.610\na high degree of confidence that things\nare gonna be done a certain way, and\n\n99\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.910\ncovered a certain way.\n\n100\n00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.030\nSo those are all big, big, big pluses.\n\n101\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.190\nBut you don't always have to have that.\n\n102\n00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.310\nThere's plenty of other agencies,\nand I do mean federal and state,\n\n103\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.460\nplus businesses themselves that do have\nexternal people they contract with.\n\n104\n00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.842\nLaw enforcement themselves,\n\n105\n00:06:17.842 --> 00:06:23.720\nquite frequently outsources\nthis digital forensic issue,\n\n106\n00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.250\nbecause they just don't have the expertise\nto the level they need it to.\n\n107\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.960\nThere are some that do have it,\nbut it's not across the board yet.\n\n108\n00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.795\nYou're more than likely to find someone\nthat's a situation where law enforcement\n\n109\n00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:41.370\nhas the traditional forensics environment,\nthan they have this one.\n\n110\n00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.330\nBut it is picking up.\n\n111\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.700\nI mean if you go to the federal level,\nyou do see stuff like,\n\n112\n00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.830\nthe Secret Service would have this,\nthe FBI has this.\n\n113\n00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.440\nThey've got well stocked and\nwell taken care of facilities for\n\n114\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.760\ndoing this sort of thing.\n\n115\n00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.525\nSo it all really depends on\nwhere you are on the food chain.\n\n116\n00:06:56.525 --> 00:07:01.714\nAnd remember, forensic personnel, one of\nthe biggest issues you've got with them,\n\n117\n00:07:01.714 --> 00:07:04.140\nis the development expense with that.\n\n118\n00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.729\nBecause they've got special equipment and\ntools.\n\n119\n00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:07.174\nAnd those tools are not cheap.\n\n120\n00:07:07.174 --> 00:07:10.690\nYes, we saw in the forensics\nexploration we did.\n\n121\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.320\nWe saw that those tools,\nsome of them are free.\n\n122\n00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.050\nBut there's quite a few, the heavy-duty\nand heavy hitters that are not free,\n\n123\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.120\nthat you're gonna be paying\nsome serious stuff for.\n\n124\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.360\nAnd even if you do have the bucks for\nthat, or you can do everything free,\n\n125\n00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.230\nthen you have the other collateral\nequipment on how to store the stuff.\n\n126\n00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.340\nAnd make sure it's all secured when\nyou're not doing your investigation, but\n\n127\n00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.410\nyou need to preserve it for an eventual,\npotential court case that may come up.\n\n128\n00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.081\nSo there's a lot of things that go into it\nand even on top of that, when you start,\n\n129\n00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:43.715\nyou're talking about forensic personnel.\n\n130\n00:07:43.715 --> 00:07:46.602\nSomething else that's very\nimportant is you just can't have\n\n131\n00:07:46.602 --> 00:07:50.059\nsomeone that's forensically trained\ncome in and say, okay you're it.\n\n132\n00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:53.895\nOr you can't tell someone in your company,\nhey we're gonna send you to forensics\n\n133\n00:07:53.895 --> 00:07:56.676\ntraining and all of a sudden\nwe'll bless you or whatever and\n\n134\n00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:58.801\nyou're gonna be the forensics person here.\n\n135\n00:07:58.801 --> 00:08:00.642\nDoesn't work that way.\n\n136\n00:08:00.642 --> 00:08:03.551\nSomeone reads all the stuff and\ndoes all the stuff,\n\n137\n00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:07.813\nthey still have to kind of do some\napprentice work, as I like to call it, for\n\n138\n00:08:07.813 --> 00:08:11.081\na while to make sure that they\nreally understand things.\n\n139\n00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:17.507\nBecause if there's someone\nthat's just read a book or\n\n140\n00:08:17.507 --> 00:08:21.286\nhas even we did that video here.\n\n141\n00:08:21.286 --> 00:08:27.766\nThat video course we did here is\ngonna get you a very good foundation,\n\n142\n00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:31.804\nget you pretty well set\nup to do forensics.\n\n143\n00:08:31.804 --> 00:08:35.806\nBut you still will have to,\nwe said that during that course,\n\n144\n00:08:35.806 --> 00:08:40.513\nyou still have to work under somebody,\nor with somebody for a while, so\n\n145\n00:08:40.513 --> 00:08:45.220\nyou can see actual stuff and\nget acclimated to it, because there's one\n\n146\n00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:50.050\nthing between seeing and\ngetting the hands on, doing it for real.\n\n147\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.200\nSo companies may not be able to do that,\nso what they'll say is, hey, well,\n\n148\n00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.110\nwe're gonna outsource, and\nthat way that we pay a fixed\n\n149\n00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.950\namount of money for\na contract to keep them on retainer.\n\n150\n00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.875\nAnd when we need them we call them and\ntake it from there.\n\n151\n00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:08.466\n>> Understand, I know we were talking\nabout this for a little bit, but\n\n152\n00:09:08.466 --> 00:09:09.659\nlet's back up for one second.\n\n153\n00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:13.477\nYou mentioned police,\na law enforcement agency\n\n154\n00:09:13.477 --> 00:09:17.860\nhaving a normal forensics\nversus a digital forensics.\n\n155\n00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.955\nSo let's define, what do we mean when\nwe talk about digital forensics.\n\n156\n00:09:20.955 --> 00:09:24.378\nCuz it's not just standard\ncrime scene type stuff.\n\n157\n00:09:24.378 --> 00:09:26.421\n>> Yes, that's a good point.\n\n158\n00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:29.497\nWe didn't really define that,\nor I didn't define it too well.\n\n159\n00:09:29.497 --> 00:09:30.542\nI don't know.\n\n160\n00:09:30.542 --> 00:09:36.642\nWhen we talk about forensics, forensics\nitself really is just examining a scene or\n\n161\n00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:42.999\nexamining the incident, whatever, with an\neye to, or with a very procedural mind and\n\n162\n00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:47.442\nknowing how to kind od look\nbeyond what's being presented,\n\n163\n00:09:47.442 --> 00:09:52.215\nhow to collect it, process it and\nsee what's happened.\n\n164\n00:09:52.215 --> 00:09:55.295\nNow there's many different\navenues of forensics.\n\n165\n00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:58.765\nWhen you look at forensics,\nforensics really is, I like to think\n\n166\n00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:03.033\nof it as not just calling it forensics\nI feel like it's kind of like a slang.\n\n167\n00:10:03.033 --> 00:10:06.265\nEven though it's correct I kind\nof feel its a slang because\n\n168\n00:10:06.265 --> 00:10:08.945\nforensics doesn't really give\nyou the full impression.\n\n169\n00:10:08.945 --> 00:10:11.755\nIt's really a forensic science\nbecause that's what it is.\n\n170\n00:10:11.755 --> 00:10:16.290\nThere's a science that goes into it that\nmakes sure you're going down the list and\n\n171\n00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:21.150\ndoing things the right way and\nyou've developed an eye for detail where\n\n172\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:26.120\nsomeone might see just a scene\nwith some stuff laying there,\n\n173\n00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.670\nyou're looking at other stuff that\nmay actually not fully be there.\n\n174\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.180\nIf you go into a scene\nyour trained to see well,\n\n175\n00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.000\nthere's a cable here that goes to\na printer, but there's no printer here.\n\n176\n00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.840\nThere's a printer manual here that looks\npretty new, and there's no printer here.\n\n177\n00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.650\nOr there's a cap for a USB device here.\n\n178\n00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.150\nThose type of things are things that\nyou've kinda gotta train your eye for.\n\n179\n00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.470\nIt goes way beyond the norm.\n\n180\n00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.320\nSo then Mike would say,\nokay there's some books up there and\n\n181\n00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.100\nthere's a USB cable sitting here,\nno biggie.\n\n182\n00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.910\nYou have to train your eye, just like a\ntraditional forensics person would look at\n\n183\n00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.650\na scene and might look at the crime\nscene and be looking at stuff and\n\n184\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:12.900\nnotice hey, on that Chopping block\nover there where there's knives in it,\n\n185\n00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.150\nthere's a knife missing\nthere's a spot there.\n\n186\n00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.400\nWhen everyone else just see well,\nit's a bunch of knives.\n\n187\n00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.550\nIt's like oh, well now I'm looking\nbeyond and looking at the detail, and\n\n188\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:27.190\nsaying there's a slot there for a knife\nthat's clearly not there, and a couple\n\n189\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:32.260\nof other things out of place that seems\nto indicate that something is going on.\n\n190\n00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.850\nSo, when we look at forensics we have,\nwhat I like to think about\n\n191\n00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:40.900\ntraditional forensics which is the stuff\nthat deals with blood splatter or\n\n192\n00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.780\nin all the crime scenes,\nmurder, stuff like that.\n\n193\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.175\nAnd then there's the digital\nstuff that deals with,\n\n194\n00:11:47.175 --> 00:11:50.020\nreally all the electronic gadgets.\n\n195\n00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.860\nIt deals with computers,\nit deals with cell phones, tablets, and,\n\n196\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.015\nyou know, you name it.\n\n197\n00:11:56.015 --> 00:11:59.620\nIt's even dealing with stuff\nlike video and things like that.\n\n198\n00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:05.730\nIt's a lot of stuff covered under\nthe banner of digital forensics.\n\n199\n00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.780\n>> And why would you say it's so\nimportant?\n\n200\n00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.830\nI mean, if I'm having an incident or\nsomething, I stop the incident,\n\n201\n00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.790\nwe're good to go, we go back to work,\nwhy is forensics so important?\n\n202\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.480\n>> There's numerous reasons why it would\nhave a significant importance as part\n\n203\n00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.500\nof your incident response process and\nyour overall functioning.\n\n204\n00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.040\nFirst of all, if a crimes been committed,\n\n205\n00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.080\nthat's pretty much the only real way\nyou're going to have definitive proof.\n\n206\n00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.930\nYou may not need to do that really,\nreally, pushing stuff back and\n\n207\n00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.870\ngoing through the weeds\ntrying to find something.\n\n208\n00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.310\nBut that may be the only way you're\ngonna find anything whatsoever.\n\n209\n00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:49.010\nIf you just kind of, hey, well,\nclean this up and drive on.\n\n210\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.780\nYou could be destroying evidence or\n\n211\n00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.215\nany chance that anything you're ever gonna\nbe able to recover anything off of that.\n\n212\n00:12:54.215 --> 00:12:58.205\nIn fact the longer stuff goes on from the\ntime the incident happened to the time you\n\n213\n00:12:58.205 --> 00:13:01.745\nactually collect the evidence, the more\nof a chance you have of something bad\n\n214\n00:13:01.745 --> 00:13:05.935\nhappening to whatever you\ncould have collected.\n\n215\n00:13:05.935 --> 00:13:07.865\nIt could have met its\ndemise a long time ago.\n\n216\n00:13:07.865 --> 00:13:08.995\nNow you're stuck.\n\n217\n00:13:08.995 --> 00:13:13.330\nSo that's something\ndefinitely to remember.\n\n218\n00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.910\nThen there's also a thing of even\nif there isn't a crime committed,\n\n219\n00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:20.850\nremember when we see on TV and stuff like\nthat, we see all these shows on forensics,\n\n220\n00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.060\nit's like,\noh someone you know got killed or\n\n221\n00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.830\na crime happened, someone got hit with\na candlestick in the library, whatever.\n\n222\n00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.280\nYou know something happened.\n\n223\n00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.890\nBut the thing is how do you Is it\nthat we think of it in those terms.\n\n224\n00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.610\nIt doesn't have to be a crime or\neven happen at all.\n\n225\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.713\nSomething happened and\nI need to investigate it because\n\n226\n00:13:42.713 --> 00:13:47.002\nsomeone needs to figure out\nwhat holes need to be patched.\n\n227\n00:13:47.002 --> 00:13:50.220\nSo that could be another side of it.\n\n228\n00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.843\nAnd then there's also just the one we've\nbeen talking about over and over again,\n\n229\n00:13:53.843 --> 00:13:55.070\nthe legal side of it.\n\n230\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:02.101\nFrom the legal side, you would need to\nhave, you may very well need to have that.\n\n231\n00:14:02.101 --> 00:14:06.902\nBecause they just strictly mandated that\nyou have to have a forensic person here,\n\n232\n00:14:06.902 --> 00:14:11.846\nbecause if anything happens that you can't\naccount for and then that person needs to\n\n233\n00:14:11.846 --> 00:14:15.905\nbe consulted to see if what needs to\nbe done and how it needs to be done.\n\n234\n00:14:15.905 --> 00:14:20.194\nThat's a big, big,\nimportant part of this when you\n\n235\n00:14:20.194 --> 00:14:24.480\ntalk about forensics,\nit's how things are done.\n\n236\n00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.830\nYou can collect stuff from a system that's\ndown or been compromised, and then you can\n\n237\n00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.430\nreally collect stuff from a system\nthat's been down or been compromised.\n\n238\n00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:37.340\nReason why I put it that way is\nbecause you could have a situation\n\n239\n00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.370\nwhere there's evidence there and if it's\ncollected the wrong way, it's not gonna\n\n240\n00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:46.840\nhold up in any sort of real investigative\nsense, especially not in a legal sense.\n\n241\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.060\nBut if you do follow the procedures and\nyou dot all your Is and cross all your Ts\n\n242\n00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:56.660\nand all that good stuff, then it will hold\nwater in court if it ever has to go there.\n\n243\n00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:02.340\nAnd if you watched the forensics course,\nyou may have already seen me say,\n\n244\n00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.850\nthat you've kinda gotta make\nan assumption in a lot of senses,\n\n245\n00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.780\nis that ultimately this\nis going to go to court.\n\n246\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.000\nIf it doesn't then fine,\nit at least met the standard if it did.\n\n247\n00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.480\nIt's better to meet the standard and not\ngo there, than not meet the standard and\n\n248\n00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.745\nhave them say we're taking this\nto court and be like I'm screwed.\n\n249\n00:15:20.745 --> 00:15:24.410\n[LAUGH] You don't wanna have\nthat situation come into play.\n\n250\n00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.643\n>> I really, really should've used\nthose evidence bags, gosh darn it.\n\n251\n00:15:28.643 --> 00:15:29.877\n[LAUGH]\n>> And it's a little thing,\n\n252\n00:15:29.877 --> 00:15:33.330\nthat' show sensitive it is, and that's\nwhy it take so long to see it, to get one\n\n253\n00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:38.070\nseasoned is just what you just said, is\nthai you don't put something in the bag,\n\n254\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.780\ndon't label it correctly, it doesn't mean\nthat evidence has to be compromised.\n\n255\n00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:48.440\nAll it does is have to suggest that you're\na little sloppy in how you do things.\n\n256\n00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.956\nAnd then they can look\nat this other stuff.\n\n257\n00:15:50.956 --> 00:15:54.950\nThey've got a way to kind\nof get you on other stuff.\n\n258\n00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.598\nThey've got that foot in the door,\nso you want to avoid that.\n\n259\n00:15:57.598 --> 00:16:00.581\n>> That's that doubt, that defense\nattorney is gonna tear you up.\n\n260\n00:16:00.581 --> 00:16:04.766\n>> Yeah, and the more weight is on it,\nthe type of case,\n\n261\n00:16:04.766 --> 00:16:10.067\nthey can actually say They don't\nhave to prove that you're wrong,\n\n262\n00:16:10.067 --> 00:16:15.740\nthey just have to muddy the waters\nenough to introduce some doubt which in\n\n263\n00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:22.430\nsome cases they will not convict because\nthere's just too much in doubt there.\n\n264\n00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.690\nAnd people have trouble getting their\nminds around that too, I've noticed that.\n\n265\n00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:30.422\nYou see that in all sorts of court\ncases that people look at and say oh,\n\n266\n00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:32.473\nthey got them dead to rights.\n\n267\n00:16:32.473 --> 00:16:34.250\nWe know that person did it.\n\n268\n00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.890\nWell, you may know the person\ndid it just by what you see,\n\n269\n00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.410\nbut the legal system defines certain\nstandards that need to be met.\n\n270\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.890\nAnd if those aren't met, even though\neverything else kinda suggests it,\n\n271\n00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.500\nif those standards aren't met,\nthen it doesn't work.\n\n272\n00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:52.660\nThat's why you've seen people with a lot\nof frustration over the last five,\n\n273\n00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.550\nsix, seven years plus.\n\n274\n00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.330\nYou can go back as far as you want.\n\n275\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.490\nThere's been frustration with\npeople just walking away.\n\n276\n00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.490\nIt's like, oh, that person did it.\n\n277\n00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.000\nWe know the person that you know did it.\n\n278\n00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.450\nIt's like yeah, I know they did it, but\nI can't have any stuff that definitively\n\n279\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.420\nsays in the eyes of the law that that\nperson did it, so I have to let them go.\n\n280\n00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.180\n>> And then would you say, too,\n\n281\n00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.110\nsometimes these investigations might\nuncover more than what we initially\n\n282\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:18.370\nthought was the incident, like the whole\ntip of the iceberg type model.\n\n283\n00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:21.023\n>> Yeah, be prepared in some cases for\nthe rabbit hole to go pretty deep.\n\n284\n00:17:21.023 --> 00:17:24.469\n>> You might have an incident where\nsomebody accessed the server remotely and\n\n285\n00:17:24.469 --> 00:17:27.640\nif you're not careful you close\nthat down which you don't realize,\n\n286\n00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.400\nis he planted a back door, and\nhe's accessed other servers remotely.\n\n287\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:38.810\n>> Yeah there's been cases like that on\nfile that have happened over the years.\n\n288\n00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:43.470\nThe one that comes to mind right away\nthat, you know I mentioned it in I think\n\n289\n00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:48.790\nour ethical hacking course when we did it,\nis the story\n\n290\n00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.960\nthat they have, and it's a book called\nThe Cuckoo's Egg, it's fascinating.\n\n291\n00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.480\nIf anyone's ever read it, you know what\nI'm talking about, it's fascinating.\n\n292\n00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.610\nIt started with someone doing a minor\ninvestigation on a few cents charge\n\n293\n00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:08.050\non a phone bill and that ballooned out to\n\n294\n00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:12.860\nlike a major international\nspying type thing and all that.\n\n295\n00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.320\nIt was just crazy, it was just by\nsomeone being all over that that was\n\n296\n00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.710\npaying the bills and\nlooking at the paperwork saying,\n\n297\n00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.190\nwhy am I getting charged three cents\na month for this by the phone company?\n\n298\n00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.793\nWhere is this coming from?\n\n299\n00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:26.177\nThis isn't accounted for.\n\n300\n00:18:26.177 --> 00:18:29.617\nAnd so, once they reconciled things,\n\n301\n00:18:29.617 --> 00:18:34.942\ndid a more investigation,\nthey found all this other stuff.\n\n302\n00:18:34.942 --> 00:18:39.244\nYou can guarantee in that case that\nthe person that started that looking and\n\n303\n00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:42.863\ncalling the phone company,\nthis was I think back in the 70s,\n\n304\n00:18:42.863 --> 00:18:44.450\n80s somewhere in there.\n\n305\n00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.210\nIt's been a while since I looked at it.\n\n306\n00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.830\nBut it was when they were using\nmainframes and stuff like that.\n\n307\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:56.060\nThey found this variation in there and\nyou're talking the old school days.\n\n308\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.150\nThey found it and were able to say, woah.\n\n309\n00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:03.540\nThis went from being just a few cents\ndiscrepancy on a bill to all of a sudden\n\n310\n00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.830\nwe're trying to track someone down.\n\n311\n00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.360\nI think the ultimate person there was\nsupposedly working with the Soviets, and\n\n312\n00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.160\nhe was based over in Germany or something.\n\n313\n00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.440\nIt was really crazy,\nyou never would've drawn it between those.\n\n314\n00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:23.250\nBut someone being curious and doing their\njob, opened up this whole can of worms,\n\n315\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.890\nor as like I said, that rabbit hole just\nwent way, way deeper than anyone expected.\n\n316\n00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:32.040\nIt's fascinating,\nyou can get the book really cheap now.\n\n317\n00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:37.140\n>> Now that is a great segue right\ninto our next bullet point here is,\n\n318\n00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:37.930\ncomplexities.\n\n319\n00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:42.913\nA lot of times these investigations\nare not as easy as they might seem on\n\n320\n00:19:42.913 --> 00:19:43.936\nthe surface.\n\n321\n00:19:43.936 --> 00:19:44.744\n>> They never are.\n\n322\n00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:47.780\n[LAUGH] They never are.\n\n323\n00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:53.760\nThe day you think it's simple is probably\nthe day you either need to retire or\n\n324\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.170\nyou need to think, am I missing something?\n\n325\n00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.078\nIf you think it's too simple\nyou're missing something.\n\n326\n00:20:00.078 --> 00:20:06.790\nSo these, forensics is one of those things\nthat is very complex by its very nature.\n\n327\n00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.500\nThat's why we don't have a lot of\npeople that are really well versed in\n\n328\n00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.410\nit is that you've gotta have\nthat attention to detail,\n\n329\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:17.890\nyou can't be disorganized,\nyou gotta be playing by the numbers.\n\n330\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:23.210\nIf you're not, then what happens\nis you get a big mess and you\n\n331\n00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:28.170\nget something that really isn't usable or\ngets out of your control pretty quickly.\n\n332\n00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.990\nAnd that has been known to happen\nwhere the kind of investigations\n\n333\n00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.370\ngot out of people's control because\nthey weren't paying attention.\n\n334\n00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.430\nAll these little things that\nwere happening, moving parts.\n\n335\n00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.800\nIt can get pretty crazy.\n\n336\n00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.530\nSo, do not ever underestimate just how\ncomplex one of these things can get.\n\n337\n00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.390\nI mean you can guarantee that\none if you are going to go,\n\n338\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.830\nif you haven't read the Cuckoo's Egg and\nyou're thinking about doing it now.\n\n339\n00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:56.260\nWhen you do read that, you'll see that\nthere's no way anyone suspected that,\n\n340\n00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.290\nthat was going to happen.\n\n341\n00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:01.500\nThere's so\nmany complexities that kept coming up at\n\n342\n00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:06.130\nevery turn that you had\nto be prepared for.\n\n343\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:11.220\nYou had to ask other expertise and stuff\nlike that to pile on to help you out.\n\n344\n00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.850\nSo you have to be adaptable,\nyou have to be patient,\n\n345\n00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.440\nyou gotta have attention to detail.\n\n346\n00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.570\nYou gotta be well versed and gotta\nthink well on your feet to be able to\n\n347\n00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.830\nreally handle these things\nthe way they're supposed to.\n\n348\n00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.660\nIf you're not,\nyou're gonna miss something,\n\n349\n00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.950\nyou're gonna mess something up and\nthen that doesn't help anybody.\n\n350\n00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.790\nEspecially your career\n[LAUGH] it doesn't take much\n\n351\n00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.330\nto get you out of the forensics field.\n\n352\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.630\nForensics is one of those things\nthat they don't cut you much slack.\n\n353\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.640\nIf you screw up they're like,\nthere's the door.\n\n354\n00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.575\n>> Reputation is everything and if you\ngoof up once it doesn't take long does it?\n\n355\n00:21:40.575 --> 00:21:48.304\n>> Yeah, you've really really gotta\ndo everything by the numbers.\n\n356\n00:21:48.304 --> 00:21:51.560\nThat's one of the reasons\nwhy we tell you and\n\n357\n00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.520\nI said this in our whole\ninvestigation of forensics.\n\n358\n00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.767\nI said you have to really use\nwhatever means you have, checklists,\n\n359\n00:21:59.767 --> 00:22:04.327\nwhatever to make sure you're doing\nstuff the way they're supposed to.\n\n360\n00:22:04.327 --> 00:22:06.894\nThat way you don't forget anything and\n\n361\n00:22:06.894 --> 00:22:11.174\nyou're proceeding through stuff,\nthe orders of volatility and\n\n362\n00:22:11.174 --> 00:22:16.012\nall that because all those things can\nreally mess up your investigation.\n\n363\n00:22:16.012 --> 00:22:18.576\nAnd let me tell you, that trust thing,\n\n364\n00:22:18.576 --> 00:22:24.250\ndon't ever underestimate how important\nthat trust is in the scheme of things.\n\n365\n00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.310\nYeah, I know these things are complex, if\nthey're starting to get out of your hand,\n\n366\n00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.860\nyou call in extra\nfirepower to help you out.\n\n367\n00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.290\nDon't just keep saying,\noh I got it, I got it, I got it.\n\n368\n00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.620\nYou don't have it,\nyou know you don't have it.\n\n369\n00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:41.060\nGet assistance on it to take care of\nthat before it really becomes a mess.\n\n370\n00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:45.530\nThere's been cases over the years where\nforensics personnel have made mistakes,\n\n371\n00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:51.590\nand they repeatedly made those mistakes,\nand they have, and this is\n\n372\n00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:56.093\nin the traditional world, there's no real\nnotable ones in the digital world yet.\n\n373\n00:22:56.093 --> 00:22:57.231\nBut they, in the traditional world,\n\n374\n00:22:57.231 --> 00:23:01.960\nthey've had ones where forensics people\nthat work for the state or for that\n\n375\n00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.820\ncounty have, when they found a discrepancy\nin their case and investigated that.\n\n376\n00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.744\nAnd they went back and\ninvestigated other cases and\n\n377\n00:23:09.744 --> 00:23:12.671\nthey found a pattern over\nyears that had been done.\n\n378\n00:23:12.671 --> 00:23:16.911\nAnd so what happened is all the evidence\nthat was used to convict all\n\n379\n00:23:16.911 --> 00:23:21.093\nthese people in the past, and\nall these cases had to be reopened.\n\n380\n00:23:21.093 --> 00:23:24.785\nAnd some of them were dismissed\nbecause the evidence was not valid,\n\n381\n00:23:24.785 --> 00:23:26.940\nit wasn't processed the correct way.\n\n382\n00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:31.420\nSomething was left out, or there was\nevidence, there was signs pointing to\n\n383\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.990\nthe fact that the forensic tech\nmaybe molded the evidence for\n\n384\n00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.328\nan expected outcome.\n\n385\n00:23:36.328 --> 00:23:40.746\nWhich is something that it may\nsound kind of easy to do but\n\n386\n00:23:40.746 --> 00:23:45.072\neasy not to do, just like,\nleave things as you see it.\n\n387\n00:23:45.072 --> 00:23:48.579\nThe human mind is, unless you get\nreally trained to do this and\n\n388\n00:23:48.579 --> 00:23:52.558\nget it out of your system, the human\nbrain has this whole idea of well,\n\n389\n00:23:52.558 --> 00:23:57.226\nthis is the goal I want in mind, I'm going\nto steer everything towards that goal.\n\n390\n00:23:57.226 --> 00:24:01.359\nWhen it should be forensics it's\nlike The goal is just to get,\n\n391\n00:24:01.359 --> 00:24:06.470\nto get a truthful and accurate\nrepresentation of what happened there.\n\n392\n00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:07.750\nThat's your goal.\n\n393\n00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.440\nMy goal wasn't whether this\nguy's innocent or guilty, or\n\n394\n00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.730\nthis happened or didn't happen.\n\n395\n00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:16.150\nBut it's to find out what\nthe nature of that incident is and\n\n396\n00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.660\nfind out what truly happened on the day.\n\n397\n00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:22.380\nIf it happens to be that it did happen or\ndidn't happen, I've determined that.\n\n398\n00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.090\n>> We've got a question,\nI don't know if we can answer this one.\n\n399\n00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:27.345\nI don't know how well trained you are on\nwhat we'll call regular forensics.\n\n400\n00:24:27.345 --> 00:24:31.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Roberto is asking in what areas do you\n\n401\n00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.570\ncross over between the two areas of study,\nin what areas are they very different?\n\n402\n00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.140\n>> I guess traditional.\n\n403\n00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:43.690\n>> Yeah, your crime scene investigation\nversus a digital forensics investigator.\n\n404\n00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.010\nProbably like evidence handling\nmight be one of the similarities.\n\n405\n00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:52.070\n>> They're pretty close in a lot of\nareas as far as chain of custody,\n\n406\n00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.770\nbasic concepts, stuff like that.\n\n407\n00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.870\nThose are gonna be very much the same.\n\n408\n00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.460\nTrain your eye, and all that,\nthose are pretty much gonna be the same.\n\n409\n00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:04.360\nThe things that would be different are the\nstuff specific to the digital world about\n\n410\n00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.290\nhow you go about the evidence\nyou can collect.\n\n411\n00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.800\nOne of the things we have\nthat's totally different,\n\n412\n00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.540\ndoesn't exist in the traditional world,\nis the orders of volatility.\n\n413\n00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:18.480\nYou just don't have that, I mean there\nare volatile pieces of evidence,\n\n414\n00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.570\ndon't kid yourself,\nin the traditional world.\n\n415\n00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.150\nBut it's not the same type of stuff.\n\n416\n00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.020\nThey have an order of\nvolatility that they obey.\n\n417\n00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.080\nThen they have different\npreservation stuff in there.\n\n418\n00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.030\nYou do not take a computer from a crime\nscene, shove it in a fridge some place.\n\n419\n00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:34.795\nThat doesn't happen.\n\n420\n00:25:34.795 --> 00:25:37.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You do have to do that with\n\n421\n00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.080\nthe body to keep it from decomposing,\nor anything like that.\n\n422\n00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.830\nAnd you have to preserve that\nevidence in a certain consistent way.\n\n423\n00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:48.680\nSo, their's has a lot more science and\nlot more background to.\n\n424\n00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.470\nI mean you're talking\nall sorts of biology and\n\n425\n00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:56.630\nall that involved, those people really,\nheavily getting into it.\n\n426\n00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:02.155\n>> So, you might say our processes or\nthe end goal is very similar.\n\n427\n00:26:02.155 --> 00:26:06.445\nCollect evidence, preserve evidence,\ntake it to court, prosecute.\n\n428\n00:26:06.445 --> 00:26:11.862\nBut the methods we use, and the tools\nwe use are gonna be a big difference.\n\n429\n00:26:11.862 --> 00:26:16.622\n>> Oh yeah, yeah you'll notice that yeah\n\n430\n00:26:16.622 --> 00:26:20.592\nthe process overall looks the same but\nonce you start digging down too far,\n\n431\n00:26:20.592 --> 00:26:24.192\nit doesn't take much, you'll notice that\nyeah there are distinct differences.\n\n432\n00:26:24.192 --> 00:26:28.312\nYou just can't use the same methods\nin both as far as tagging and\n\n433\n00:26:28.312 --> 00:26:30.664\nbagging stuff and stuff like that.\n\n434\n00:26:30.664 --> 00:26:34.011\nWe had that on both sides, as far as how\nyou preserve what you're tagging and\n\n435\n00:26:34.011 --> 00:26:36.066\nbagging, that's a whole different method.\n\n436\n00:26:36.066 --> 00:26:39.177\n>> Right cuz we gotta have the 30 bag\ninstead of just a normal evidence back\n\n437\n00:26:39.177 --> 00:26:39.790\nfor example.\n\n438\n00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:40.370\n>> Yeah.\n\n439\n00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.650\nAnd they don't need to\ndeal with that at all.\n\n440\n00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:48.660\nThere's different things on either\nside that you need to consider.\n\n441\n00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.270\n>> And\nthat's a good comment there Roberto.\n\n442\n00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:54.490\nA bloody knife is a bloody knife\nput an iPad has a battery [LAUGH].\n\n443\n00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.976\n>> Yea it's,\nthey're different worlds and who knows,\n\n444\n00:26:57.976 --> 00:27:00.569\nyou may actually cross paths with them.\n\n445\n00:27:00.569 --> 00:27:04.772\nYou're gonna see more and more of that.\n\n446\n00:27:04.772 --> 00:27:07.887\nAnd we're already seeing\nan increased number of that,\n\n447\n00:27:07.887 --> 00:27:12.760\nwhen two worlds do collide or I shouldn't\nsay collide but they do come together.\n\n448\n00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.860\nBecause you'll have people that are, you\nmay have a murder scene that someone's got\n\n449\n00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:21.370\na cell phone on them, or an iPad in\ntheir car, or backpack, or whatever.\n\n450\n00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.960\nAnd now you investigate that.\n\n451\n00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.030\nThey're not gonna do that.\n\n452\n00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:27.770\nThey're gonna get what\nthey need off of it.\n\n453\n00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.773\nHose off the blood and give it to you.\n\n454\n00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:34.842\n>> So, we see like a working together\nthen of the traditional forensics and\n\n455\n00:27:34.842 --> 00:27:36.598\nthe digital forensics.\n\n456\n00:27:36.598 --> 00:27:41.516\n>> Yeah and just to be fair\nbecause I don't know everyone\n\n457\n00:27:41.516 --> 00:27:45.561\nthat would be watching this or\nsomething and\n\n458\n00:27:45.561 --> 00:27:51.240\ngoing through this capturing or\nforensics course we did.\n\n459\n00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.620\nDo remember that when you\nlook at this that's just two,\n\n460\n00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.720\nI say, traditional forensics and\ndigital forensics.\n\n461\n00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.350\nThere are other types of forensics.\n\n462\n00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:08.720\nThere actually is forensic accounting, and\nall other things out there that they do.\n\n463\n00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.250\nAnd no matter where it is,\nif you hear the word forensics,\n\n464\n00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.480\nyou know it's a way of collecting,\nprocessing, doing really in depth\n\n465\n00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.795\ninvestigation of something to find out\norigin or causes, and things like that.\n\n466\n00:28:19.795 --> 00:28:24.220\nI just heard a new term\n\n467\n00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:29.100\ntrailed by the word forensics over\nthe last week when they had that\n\n468\n00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:35.590\nthat piece of an aircraft wash up on-\n>> Oh yeah, from the Malaysian flight.\n\n469\n00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:39.060\n>> Yeah and\nthey really strongly believe it's that.\n\n470\n00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.200\nIn fact, I don't know if they've confirmed\nit yet, but everyone's kind of like yeah.\n\n471\n00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.290\n>> Weren't they looking at\nbarnacles on it or something?\n\n472\n00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:48.637\n>> Yeah, they were looking at the\nbarnacles because barnacles apparently,\n\n473\n00:28:48.637 --> 00:28:50.586\nyou know-\n>> For a specific species or something?\n\n474\n00:28:50.586 --> 00:28:52.384\nWhat do they call it, Bio forensics?\n\n475\n00:28:52.384 --> 00:28:53.301\n>> It was something like that.\n\n476\n00:28:53.301 --> 00:28:58.201\nYeah, they can tie barnacles\nare apparently pretty specific to\n\n477\n00:28:58.201 --> 00:28:59.479\ncertain areas.\n\n478\n00:28:59.479 --> 00:29:02.282\nAnd so\nthey can look at those barnacles and\n\n479\n00:29:02.282 --> 00:29:06.942\nsee which ones were there since\nthere were different species there.\n\n480\n00:29:06.942 --> 00:29:09.087\nAnd so\nthey can look at those barnacles and\n\n481\n00:29:09.087 --> 00:29:12.898\ntrace the path to back to where this\nthing, close to where it originated.\n\n482\n00:29:12.898 --> 00:29:19.624\nI think they could probably get\nit down to within 1,000 miles or\n\n483\n00:29:19.624 --> 00:29:27.542\nless just by doing a forensic analysis\non those particular life forms on there.\n\n484\n00:29:27.542 --> 00:29:31.909\nSo, it's just an incredibly fascinating\nthing that they could do that.\n\n485\n00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:33.872\nIt makes sense once they explain it.\n\n486\n00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:36.700\nI'm like well, I guess it makes,\ntotally makes sense.\n\n487\n00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:41.660\nNever would have thought about it, but\nit made sense once they put it out there.\n\n488\n00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.399\nSo forensics they can do\nwith a lot of things.\n\n489\n00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:47.953\nSome of them might not be as\nexciting as the others, but\n\n490\n00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:52.747\nI can't imagine the world ever doing\na TV series on forensic accounting,\n\n491\n00:29:52.747 --> 00:29:54.983\nbut-\n>> [LAUGH] You never know.\n\n492\n00:29:54.983 --> 00:29:56.305\nSome of these stations\nare getting pretty desperate.\n\n493\n00:29:56.305 --> 00:29:58.760\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n494\n00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.550\n>> Weil, ladies and gentlemen, that's\ngonna do it for this particular episode.\n\n495\n00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.640\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n496\n00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.369\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n497\n00:30:05.369 --> 00:30:06.547\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n498\n00:30:06.547 --> 00:30:07.710\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Rodrick,\n\n3\n00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:15.680\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.570\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.130\n>> Doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.950\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.710\n>> Fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.250\nWe got another exciting\nepisode coming your way in our\n\n9\n00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.460\nCompt Advanced Security Practitioner\nseries.\n\n10\n00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.180\nThis one we're going to continue\nour look at digital forensics.\n\n11\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.830\nSo, Sean, we left off with the previous\nepisode, we kind of defined what digital\n\n12\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.940\nforensics was and the role it played and\nhow important it was as well as\n\n13\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.520\na lot of the complexities that\nare involved with digital forensics.\n\n14\n00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.190\nNow we want to take a look at how\nthis fits in with incident response.\n\n15\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.280\n>> Yeah, this is where forensics kinda\nreally comes in the whole thing.\n\n16\n00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.010\nIt comes into its own.\n\n17\n00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.670\nIf you've been through\nthe incident response process and\n\n18\n00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.940\ngot familiar with that and\nwe got some familiarity with the care.\n\n19\n00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.420\nYou understand what's happening there.\n\n20\n00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.630\nWe have an incident, something is\ndisruptive to the normal flow and\n\n21\n00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.110\nworking on the organization.\n\n22\n00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.420\nNow what are we doing.\n\n23\n00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.870\nWe're trying to do\nsomething to address that.\n\n24\n00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.130\nBut along the way forensics\npersonnel may be called in and\n\n25\n00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.320\ntasked with trying to resolve whatever\ncaused that in the first place.\n\n26\n00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.090\nIn fact, in some cases they could\nstop what's going on until they get\n\n27\n00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.760\ntheir evidence or get what they need and\n\n28\n00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.160\nsign off on it for you to proceed if\nyou're the one managing the maintenance.\n\n29\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.080\nResponse process, so\nit does play a very key\n\n30\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.530\nrole in that in the fact that\nthey're least gonna get consulted\n\n31\n00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.670\non if they need to bring their weapons and\nknowledge to bare.\n\n32\n00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.270\nJust to, to do a little more in depth.\n\n33\n00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.310\nObviously not in every case,\n\n34\n00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.550\nit's not gonna be necessary to\nbring those expertise to bear.\n\n35\n00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.000\nI mean if you've got incident that\nwas happening because of flooding or\n\n36\n00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.320\nsomething, I doubt you really need to.\n\n37\n00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.600\nToo much of a forensic analysis,\nand I'm being generous.\n\n38\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.860\nYou don't really don't have to\ndo any at all in that case,\n\n39\n00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.390\nyou know there's really not a crime there.\n\n40\n00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.910\nMore than likely not a crime involved with\nhaving a flood or something like that.\n\n41\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.830\nSo that would be a situation where you\nprobably don't have to call them in.\n\n42\n00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.200\nBut there could be other things, if\nthere was evidence of data being stolen,\n\n43\n00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.660\nwell then, you're gonna call them and\nsay, this is what I have.\n\n44\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.890\nThis is what I'm finding\nout what happened or\n\n45\n00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.540\nwhat seemed to have occurred so\nbefore I present any further.\n\n46\n00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.940\nYou guys wanna come down and investigate\nthis to see if there's something that\n\n47\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.090\nyou need here or for\nyou to sign off and to go any further.\n\n48\n00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.080\nSo it does play very important role in\nthere is that they're gonna be somewhere\n\n49\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.400\nin that process and\nheck there's companies that have\n\n50\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.960\nfull blown incident response teams,\nwhich is not uncommon.\n\n51\n00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.570\nWhen they have a instant response team,\n\n52\n00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.140\nthere very well could be\na forensic person on that.\n\n53\n00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.150\nThat when you call the main\nperson in charge of that team,\n\n54\n00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.740\nthey start notifying their members\n\n55\n00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.785\nof that team that something's happened\nthat they're and put them on alert.\n\n56\n00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:19.475\nThe forensic person is gonna be\nsomehow involved in that and say okay,\n\n57\n00:03:19.475 --> 00:03:23.125\nwell, I'm gonna kinda keep an eye to see\nif there's anything I can get involved\n\n58\n00:03:24.215 --> 00:03:26.847\nin before anything proceeds and\nhas gone to far.\n\n59\n00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:30.165\n>> Because we really don't know in\nthe beginning whether we need the digital,\n\n60\n00:03:30.165 --> 00:03:31.895\nthe forensics investigators on not.\n\n61\n00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:35.065\nIf we got, let's say,\nI don't know, data is missing.\n\n62\n00:03:35.065 --> 00:03:37.970\nIf an incident response\nis gonna have to go down.\n\n63\n00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.760\nBut was it because of just normal\nhardware failure, or data corruption, or\n\n64\n00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.290\ndid someone break in and\nwipe that database out?\n\n65\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.110\nSo they need to be involved\nearly on just in case,\n\n66\n00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.790\nbecause I think you said in our previous\nepisode, you can't go back right and say,\n\n67\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.140\noh yeah, I meant to bag this evidence,\nor handle it the proper way.\n\n68\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.169\nIt's kind of too late at that point.\n\n69\n00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.370\nOnce evidence has been destroyed,\nit's destroyed.\n\n70\n00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.090\nI mean, especially, in the sense that\nsome of it is going to be absolutely,\n\n71\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.150\npositively volatile.\n\n72\n00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.950\nIf it's something stored in RAM,\nthat's volatile in its very nature.\n\n73\n00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.320\nYou turn that machine off,\nall the processes, all the data and\n\n74\n00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.270\neverything in there goes poof.\n\n75\n00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.730\nIt's gone into the ether.\n\n76\n00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.650\nYou can't say, well, I want to do an undo.\n\n77\n00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.565\nIt ain't gonna happen.\n\n78\n00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:20.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n79\n00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.870\nyou're stuck with\nthe situation that you made.\n\n80\n00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.500\nSo you really need to get\nin early in that process,\n\n81\n00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.650\nwhich is why you have\nan instant response team.\n\n82\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.090\nYou have forensic representation,\nand that way,\n\n83\n00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.205\nwhen you have that, those people\ncan say okay, well, whoa, stop.\n\n84\n00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:38.853\nWhat you doing?\n\n85\n00:04:38.853 --> 00:04:42.000\nI have some stuff that needs to\nbe done here, before you proceed,\n\n86\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.510\nbecause this stuff will be gone\nif you do what you're proposing.\n\n87\n00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.530\nThey would play a huge role in\ntheir either giving you guidance or\n\n88\n00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.020\nsaying that there's something they need\nto get involved with at a much more,\n\n89\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.400\na deeper level than normal.\n\n90\n00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.920\n>> All right.\n\n91\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.220\nAnd then of course we've gotta\ntalk about legal requirements.\n\n92\n00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.110\nAre there times when we're required\nto do forensic investigations?\n\n93\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.410\nOr is that where we're going with that?\n\n94\n00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.880\n>> Yeah, you're kind of there when you\nsay that are you required to do it.\n\n95\n00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.650\nIts one of those saying that you're\nrequired under certain circumstances\n\n96\n00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.890\nto do it.\n\n97\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.890\nIf you have evidence or have any sort of\ninkling I guess is a better way to put it,\n\n98\n00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.250\nthat there was a crime committed.\n\n99\n00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.875\nThat there was something really\nseriously nasty happening there\n\n100\n00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:37.335\nthen what'd you gotta do.\n\n101\n00:05:37.335 --> 00:05:41.915\nWell in a lot of cases you're gonna\nhave to call in a forensics team or\n\n102\n00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:45.287\ncall on their expertise to\nsee this is what I have.\n\n103\n00:05:45.287 --> 00:05:48.347\nThis is, I was instructed to\ncontact you and blahbetty blah,\n\n104\n00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:49.767\nall that type of stuff.\n\n105\n00:05:49.767 --> 00:05:52.337\nAnd then they get to\nmake a judgement call if\n\n106\n00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:58.697\nthat needs to go any further, or\nthey can kinda leave it how it is.\n\n107\n00:05:58.697 --> 00:06:01.048\nSo legal requirements.\n\n108\n00:06:01.048 --> 00:06:07.798\nI gave you one example with\nthat financial agency.\n\n109\n00:06:07.798 --> 00:06:11.048\nThere's a legal requirement that\nthey have to do several things.\n\n110\n00:06:11.048 --> 00:06:13.128\nOne of them is that, like you said,\n\n111\n00:06:13.128 --> 00:06:16.708\nyou have any people at the top,\nthe top person in charge of the agency, or\n\n112\n00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:20.680\nthe people just directly under them,\nI believe, in their case.\n\n113\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.770\nNone of those people when\nthey leave the agency,\n\n114\n00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.020\nnone of those computers get\nrolled back into service.\n\n115\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.790\nAll those computers are decommissioned\nimmediately, hard drives are pulled and\n\n116\n00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.520\nimaged and tagged, bagged and\nstuck into a vault.\n\n117\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.840\nNobody gets access to it except\nthose people, the forensics people.\n\n118\n00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.010\nAnd it's not because\na crime has been committed.\n\n119\n00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.870\nIt's because there was\nsomething put in place.\n\n120\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.480\nAfter they did have a problem\nwith the director in the past,\n\n121\n00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.301\nthey said that person was\nengaged in corruption and\n\n122\n00:06:51.301 --> 00:06:55.730\nsuspicious behavior.\n\n123\n00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.380\nSo what they did is they changed their\nwhole process, once one of those people\n\n124\n00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.440\nleft, part of their exiting process was\nhey, you're cleaning out your desk?\n\n125\n00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.030\nThe guy told me about this so pretty much\nwhen they're cleaning out their desk\n\n126\n00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.970\nthey're like hey, thank you and that's it.\n\n127\n00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.710\nThat's the last time\nyou see your computer.\n\n128\n00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.540\nYou get to say goodbye to it and\nthat's it.\n\n129\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.420\nThen they go about their process\nof storing stuff just in case.\n\n130\n00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.240\nSo their process is, when they\nforensically preserve this stuff,\n\n131\n00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.935\nthey're not even saying\na crime has been committed.\n\n132\n00:07:21.935 --> 00:07:23.690\nStatistically it's\n\n133\n00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.710\nmost of those people in\nfact all those people, it's\n\n134\n00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.030\nunlikely that they've committed a crime\nbecause it's a low incidence in that case.\n\n135\n00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:39.053\nI can't say all because it's never all,\nbut it's unlikely that they've done it but\n\n136\n00:07:39.053 --> 00:07:43.588\njust in case it ever comes into question\nthat they had anything stored on their\n\n137\n00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:48.196\nnotebook or their email account which\nthey also have to forensically preserve\n\n138\n00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:51.174\ntheir emails and\nstuff like that too at that time.\n\n139\n00:07:51.174 --> 00:07:55.604\nAll the same gets stored and they're\nstored for a substantial period of time.\n\n140\n00:07:55.604 --> 00:07:59.830\nSo if it comes back They've got the stuff\nthere and say, oh well, you went and\n\n141\n00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.172\nlooked at the director from ten years ago,\n\n142\n00:08:02.172 --> 00:08:04.860\nwe suspect that they were\nengaged in something.\n\n143\n00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.790\nAnd because you did an investigation now,\nor\n\n144\n00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.520\nsomeone was a whistleblower and\nsaid, hey guess what, so and so.\n\n145\n00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.140\nYou've got the stuff there, and you could\nlook to see if that's unfounded, or\n\n146\n00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.250\nif there is direct evidence there, or\n\n147\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:23.250\nsome evidence that shows that\nthey quite likely did this.\n\n148\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.140\n>> Interesting, so they're actually\nthinking about the volatility and the fact\n\n149\n00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:31.030\nthat that evidence wouldn't be there,\nor might not be there years from now.\n\n150\n00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.040\nOr you know down the road, and so\nif an investigation is launched,\n\n151\n00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.060\nthey know they've got at least some\nof that evidence already secured.\n\n152\n00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.070\n>> Yeah.\nThey weren't taking a chance.\n\n153\n00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.020\nAfter they said it was just\nthe smart thing to do,\n\n154\n00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.820\nis after they had this one\nindividual that was caught\n\n155\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.320\non doing multiple things that\nwere illegal, they said.\n\n156\n00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.270\nWell, for the future just to make everyone\nfeel more confident with the agency, and\n\n157\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:59.970\nalso in case we do have anything\nhappen like this in the future,\n\n158\n00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.900\nwe're just gonna proactively\npreserve everything.\n\n159\n00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:09.120\nSo, those guys did that, but\nthey also did the regular forensic stuff,\n\n160\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.297\nwhere if they had someone\nthat they suspected of doing\n\n161\n00:09:14.297 --> 00:09:20.260\nwhat have you, they had the ability\nto go in there any time of day,\n\n162\n00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:25.590\nand image that system and put it back\nwhere it was, and let the person continue\n\n163\n00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.120\nwhat they looked at to see if there\nwas any sort of question there.\n\n164\n00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.910\nThey had all sorts of things, and\n\n165\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.460\nthat was a legal requirement\nembedded on them by the state.\n\n166\n00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.370\nBut also because they're\nan investment house,\n\n167\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.460\nthey were also something that the feds\ncame in, so they have to do that.\n\n168\n00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.440\nThe FDIC and all those ones came in, and\n\n169\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.170\nsaid, well, you've got to have this stuff\nin place, just in case something happens.\n\n170\n00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.330\nThey are far from being the only ones.\n\n171\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.450\nThere's plenty of other\nplaces that use this.\n\n172\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.450\nIt's not state agencies and\nsomething just financial.\n\n173\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.160\nThere's other places too that have\nthis in the event they need it.\n\n174\n00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:05.830\nI think of stuff like most militaries,\nno matter where you are in\n\n175\n00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:10.430\nthe world, as part of their unit or\nwhatever you want to call it,\n\n176\n00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.280\nthat does investigations of crimes and\nstuff like that internal to the service.\n\n177\n00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.890\nThey've got, you know,\nthey've got that ability right there,\n\n178\n00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.130\nor they have somebody near by,\nthe access to it they can go to.\n\n179\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:28.490\nI mean they may say,\nwell this exceeds what our grasp is so\n\n180\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.100\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna,\nyou know, we've got it preserved,\n\n181\n00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.869\nwe're going to let the FBI handle it.\n\n182\n00:10:33.869 --> 00:10:37.430\nWe'll call in their resources for\nthem to take a better look at it.\n\n183\n00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.830\nSo there's a lot of things that come in.\n\n184\n00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.790\nBut if you have a legal\nrequirement to do this,\n\n185\n00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:47.540\nthen you very well better have\nsomeone on staff, or have someone\n\n186\n00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.800\nyou can contact that's familiar with the\nsituation, that knows how to do this job.\n\n187\n00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.460\nIf you fail at it legally, not only are\nyou going to let someone off the hook, but\n\n188\n00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.020\nthere's all sorts of other\nthings that go with it too.\n\n189\n00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.990\nAnd heck we don't need to bring in\nall the other stuff really, but\n\n190\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.755\nremember the other legal issues we had,\nof search warrants, and\n\n191\n00:11:08.755 --> 00:11:14.190\nthird-party possession, and could they\ngrant permission to look at these things.\n\n192\n00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.445\nThere was all sorts of things that came\ninto play there that you obviously\n\n193\n00:11:17.445 --> 00:11:19.175\nneed to versed on.\n\n194\n00:11:19.175 --> 00:11:21.417\n>> I guess a lot of things to consider.\n\n195\n00:11:21.417 --> 00:11:23.645\nAll right Sean,\nI think we'll switch gears here.\n\n196\n00:11:23.645 --> 00:11:25.255\nWe've got a little more time left.\n\n197\n00:11:25.255 --> 00:11:30.870\nLet's talk about how the role of training\nand employee awareness kind of fits in,\n\n198\n00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.420\nnot only with digital forensics, but\nI know we talked about policies and\n\n199\n00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.510\nprocedures in earlier episodes and\nthings like that.\n\n200\n00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.020\nSo it's got to be an important part,\nright?\n\n201\n00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.618\nI know when we talk about security,\nwe always talk about educating the users,\n\n202\n00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:45.260\ncuz they are that weakest link\nas we've said a few times.\n\n203\n00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.280\nSo how does this all fit in?\n\n204\n00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.240\n>> Yeah, your users really are,\nyou know, we've heard it all.\n\n205\n00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.470\nWe've heard their data jokes\nabout everything else that they\n\n206\n00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.000\nare the problem, you know, and\n\n207\n00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.980\nif we could just get rid of them then\nwe wouldn't have as many problems.\n\n208\n00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.900\nObviously that ain't gonna happen as much\nas in some cases you might like it to, but\n\n209\n00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.550\nwhat we have is we have\na situation where we have\n\n210\n00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.730\nto do something about that\npart of the equation.\n\n211\n00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.290\nYou just can't assume with\nall this technology, and\n\n212\n00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.510\nall sorts of stuff you put in place.\n\n213\n00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.940\nYou can't assume that it's automatically\ngoing to be, hey we're great.\n\n214\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.860\nThe technology and\n\n215\n00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.920\nthe physical controls that are put in\nplace are going to take care of it.\n\n216\n00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.880\nYou know, I know UC council puts\na thing is that there's no patch for\n\n217\n00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.580\nhuman stupidity.\n\n218\n00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.690\nI know they make that joke.\n\n219\n00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.820\nYou know, which is,\nI get what they're saying.\n\n220\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.498\nI've joked around for years saying you\nknow, you can't make something idiot\n\n221\n00:12:37.498 --> 00:12:40.572\nproof, because they're always\ngoing to invent a better idiot.\n\n222\n00:12:40.572 --> 00:12:43.632\nSo I make comments like that\nwhich are kind of harsh,\n\n223\n00:12:43.632 --> 00:12:46.360\nyou know both of them are kind of harsh.\n\n224\n00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.150\nBut what we're recognizing here is that\nthere's gonna be problems on that side.\n\n225\n00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.094\nAnd to cut them down,\nmitigate them as much as possible,\n\n226\n00:12:55.094 --> 00:12:59.530\nis we can be proactive in our training,\ndo security awareness,\n\n227\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.409\nlet them know the type of\nproblems that they could face.\n\n228\n00:13:03.409 --> 00:13:09.130\nLet them know what they can\ndo to make themselves safer.\n\n229\n00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:13.360\nAnd it's been shown that conducted\ncorrectly, and that's the key thing,\n\n230\n00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.350\nconducted correctly,\nthis can go a long way towards,\n\n231\n00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.430\nkind of,\nstaving off a lot of these problems.\n\n232\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:27.340\nTelling people the dangers of\nleaving their computer unlocked,\n\n233\n00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.190\nor not having a good password,\nor anything like that.\n\n234\n00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.290\nThose things do go a long way,\n\n235\n00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:38.230\nat least initially,\ntowards warding off some of the problems.\n\n236\n00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.030\nBut it has to be ongoing, you cannot sit\nthere and just say I'm gonna train someone\n\n237\n00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.140\nonce when they come in, and\njust kind of assume that that's it.\n\n238\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.690\nI've seen many places where they brought\nsomeone in, and they bring someone in,\n\n239\n00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.910\ngive them that initial orientation,\nsecurity brief and all that,\n\n240\n00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.480\nand they never get another one.\n\n241\n00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.250\nThey just never get,\nthey absolutely never get another one.\n\n242\n00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:01.690\nAnd you can't really blame the person\nthat that's always gonna be,\n\n243\n00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.380\nthat they're gonna always be safe and\nsound, because what happens is,\n\n244\n00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.540\nis that the person forgets about them,\nthey don't actively being quizzed on them,\n\n245\n00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.030\nthey're not actively using them.\n\n246\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:14.360\nSo eventually that knowledge that went in\none ear goes shooting out the other, and\n\n247\n00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.820\nits forgotten, cuz it is\na perishable skill once again, and\n\n248\n00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.160\nsomething bad happens.\n\n249\n00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.610\nAnd then on top of that, one person that\ngot hired, you know, ten years ago, and\n\n250\n00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.090\nis now coming in, and they don't know\nthe danger of mobile devices and\n\n251\n00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:28.660\nstuff like that.\n\n252\n00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.920\nThey just know plug it in.\n\n253\n00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.490\nThat wasn't in their briefing.\n\n254\n00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.450\nSo you have to get,\n\n255\n00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.860\ntraining plays a significant role\nin keeping these people up to date.\n\n256\n00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.290\nYou just have to choose\nthe appropriate level of training and\n\n257\n00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.360\nmake sure it's coordinated.\n\n258\n00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.090\nI've seen that messed\nup more often than not,\n\n259\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.650\nis that someone provides training and\nit's just horrible.\n\n260\n00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.470\n>> And we're not saying it to make\neverybody on your staff a forensic\n\n261\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.110\ninvestigator.\n\n262\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.524\nIt's not that we have to get\neverybody up to that level.\n\n263\n00:14:55.524 --> 00:14:59.250\n>> Yeah, you don't have to,\nit's not that at all.\n\n264\n00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:04.440\n>> What we are looking at here is that\npeople that are front line people,\n\n265\n00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:10.580\nthat are doing their jobs, they're typing\nemails, doing Word docs and what have you.\n\n266\n00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.540\nThey don't need to know forensics,\nI mean if that's part of their\n\n267\n00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.540\njob responsibilities of course,\nbut they don't need it,\n\n268\n00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:22.340\nthat's not part of what they do, so.\n\n269\n00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.220\nWhat do we do for them?\n\n270\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.020\nWe gear training towards them that makes\nthem understand the significance of\n\n271\n00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.950\nsecurity, and how it impacts what\nthey do and everyone else does.\n\n272\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.400\nWe give them a briefing that's\nappropriate for that job position, so\n\n273\n00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.180\nthey know about things, like if\nthey're an administrative assistant,\n\n274\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.550\nthey know about the clean desk policy.\n\n275\n00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.280\nThat's directly gonna impact them.\n\n276\n00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.420\nSo they've got already awareness\nof that and been briefed on that.\n\n277\n00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.054\nThey know about locking their computer.\n\n278\n00:15:50.054 --> 00:15:54.786\nOf course we can lock the computer\nautomatically with stuff we can push out\n\n279\n00:15:54.786 --> 00:15:57.165\nand embed on systems you can do that.\n\n280\n00:15:57.165 --> 00:16:02.991\nBut it's helping them not only by\nthe technology helps them be compliant,\n\n281\n00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:06.608\nbut the training also backs that up,\nas well.\n\n282\n00:16:06.608 --> 00:16:09.770\nSo we're trying to get all these\nthings in the mix to make them\n\n283\n00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.270\nmore secure organization.\n\n284\n00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:16.560\nSo do not ever forget what security\nawareness does in getting,\n\n285\n00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.530\nlike I said,\nthe correct training to the people.\n\n286\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.645\nI've seen that saying, the road to\nhell is paved with good intentions?\n\n287\n00:16:22.645 --> 00:16:25.660\n>> Right.\n>> I've seen that happen with\n\n288\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.720\nwith security awareness\ntraining far too often.\n\n289\n00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.158\nI've seen security\nawareness training where,\n\n290\n00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:36.607\ngreat, an organization wants to do\nsecurity awareness training but\n\n291\n00:16:36.607 --> 00:16:41.140\nthe security awareness training they do is\nnot appropriate, it's not helping anybody.\n\n292\n00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.463\nYou actually, good examples of it\nI've seen places that said we want to\n\n293\n00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:50.164\ndo security awareness training,\nlet's give someone the A plus or net plus.\n\n294\n00:16:50.164 --> 00:16:54.099\nThose are good courses, I'm not gonna\nsit here and say oh well A plus is crap.\n\n295\n00:16:54.099 --> 00:16:55.387\nNetwork plus is crap.\n\n296\n00:16:55.387 --> 00:16:58.127\nNot gonna say that.\n\n297\n00:16:58.127 --> 00:17:00.840\nThose are good credentials.\n\n298\n00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.070\nBut you can look at,\nyou guys got on a library here.\n\n299\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:09.210\nIf you haven't been through those courses,\nthey've got them in the library for ITPro.\n\n300\n00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.350\nYou look at them, great courses,\nbut they're not a security course.\n\n301\n00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:15.230\nThey weren't mean to be a security course.\n\n302\n00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.220\nThose were meant to\naddress something else.\n\n303\n00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.010\nSo if you're saying, hey we need to\nget someone in the A plus course so\n\n304\n00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.085\nthey understand security,\n\n305\n00:17:21.085 --> 00:17:25.300\nyou've just created a computer\ntechnician is what you've created.\n\n306\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.605\nSomeone who can fix and build and\ndo all that stuff in there.\n\n307\n00:17:27.605 --> 00:17:31.460\nYou've not created a specialist\nsecurity personnel.\n\n308\n00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:35.600\nWhat you need is you need stuff like\nsecurity plus for IT people, and\n\n309\n00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.530\nthen you need something that's very\nsimplified for the lower levels of, and\n\n310\n00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.710\nyou know I'm not trying to put those\npeople down, but the people that\n\n311\n00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.600\nare front line and don't get involved\nwith technology at that level.\n\n312\n00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.600\nThey need to do their jobs,\n\n313\n00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.230\ntell them about significance of\nhaving to choose a good password.\n\n314\n00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.570\nAbout where they talk.\n\n315\n00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.150\nAbout keeping papers off their desk.\n\n316\n00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.910\nAbout how to dispose of things.\n\n317\n00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.090\nAll those things are important.\n\n318\n00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.820\nAnd to really emphasize this point,\none of the things that I put into\n\n319\n00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.488\nplace with this and\nmake sure people are always aware is when,\n\n320\n00:18:06.488 --> 00:18:11.900\nyou create a new policy and\nprocedure which this all talks to.\n\n321\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.000\nIf you create a new policy,\nit can be the best policy, procedure,\n\n322\n00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.560\nwhat have you, of all time.\n\n323\n00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.320\nBut if you don't train\nanybody in how to use it and\n\n324\n00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.430\nit If it fails, well, you suck, cuz you\nscrewed the whole thing up yourself.\n\n325\n00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.510\nIt's not their fault, don't go yelling\nat them, go look in the mirror and\n\n326\n00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:32.090\nstart yelling at yourself\ncuz you screwed it up.\n\n327\n00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.950\nIf you train them and\nyou're having problems,\n\n328\n00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.860\nthen you've got some wiggle room there.\n\n329\n00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.764\nI subscribe to it, well, you do the\ntraining to make them more aware of it and\n\n330\n00:18:42.764 --> 00:18:46.241\nthat should cut down on it, but\nif the training wasn't effective,\n\n331\n00:18:46.241 --> 00:18:49.750\nmaybe your approach wasn't correct,\ntry to fine-tune it.\n\n332\n00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.630\nIf it doesn't work at that point,\nafter you've done the initial training,\n\n333\n00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.070\nmaybe done some refresher to shore it up,\n\n334\n00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:00.010\nto fix those deficient areas\nin whatever way you saw fit.\n\n335\n00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.010\nThen yeah, it's your fault.\n\n336\n00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:02.550\nIt's your fault.\n\n337\n00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.610\nIf you don't do training or you don't\ndo training correctly it's your fault.\n\n338\n00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.440\nDon't just throw training at\npeople because you want to check\n\n339\n00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.180\nsomething off your list.\n\n340\n00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.220\nIt's gotta be appropriate.\n\n341\n00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:11.870\n>> Very good.\nAll right,\n\n342\n00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.230\nwell, again,\na lot of great information there Sean,\n\n343\n00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:18.620\ntalking about digital forensics and\nhow it plays in incident response and\n\n344\n00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.050\nthere are legal requirements as well\nas you know educating our users.\n\n345\n00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.350\nCuz they're a big part of our system.\n\n346\n00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.450\nThey're the ones that\ninteract with everything and\n\n347\n00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.670\nwhile they might not be\nforensic investigators.\n\n348\n00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.830\nEverybody has a part to play in security.\n\n349\n00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.320\nAnd it's just important that we\nteach them what that part is so\n\n350\n00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.640\nthat they understand and as you said,\nat a level that's appropriate for them.\n\n351\n00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.800\nNot all of us are on that same level.\n\n352\n00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.340\nSo, great information.\n\n353\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.850\nAnything else we want to toss in\nthis episode before we wrap it up?\n\n354\n00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.630\n>> I think we're at a good point,\n\n355\n00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.800\nI mean we talked about through\nthe series of episodes in this section,\n\n356\n00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.370\nwe talked about all types of policies\nprocedures and the way things work.\n\n357\n00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.351\nSo hopefully it was,\neven though we joked around hopefully\n\n358\n00:19:56.351 --> 00:19:57.489\nit was exciting\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n359\n00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:58.930\n>> To everybody.\n\n360\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.740\nBut it's, yeah I think we've kind of\ncovered everything we needed to, so\n\n361\n00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.410\nwe're in good shape I think.\n\n362\n00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:05.350\n>> Very good.\nAll right.\n\n363\n00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.850\nWell ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n364\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.200\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n365\n00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.160\n>> And I'm Sean.\n\n366\n00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.885\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n367\n00:20:12.885 --> 00:20:17.470\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.150\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick with\nme today is Mr Shawn Oreano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.200\nHow are you doing Shawn?\n\n5\n00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.690\n>> Doing pretty good, how are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.350\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.080\nWe've got another exciting\nepisode coming your\n\n8\n00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.330\nway in our Comp Tia Advanced\nSecurity Practitioner Series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.190\nThis one we're going to be looking at\nindustry trends and ongoing research.\n\n10\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.540\nKind of a part of the bigger picture when\nwe're talking about security research and\n\n11\n00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.160\nanalysis.\n\n12\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.300\nAnd there's a lot to it.\n\n13\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.700\nAnd we're going to start off with some\nbasics and just talk about analyzing\n\n14\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.000\nindustry trends and how we go\nabout keeping a breast of modern.\n\n15\n00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.303\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n16\n00:00:45.303 --> 00:00:47.275\nI guess is where we're going, right?\n\n17\n00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:52.195\n>> That's really it,\nis that you've gotta keep a track, and\n\n18\n00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:55.085\nyou gotta stay on top of things,\nis of what's going on.\n\n19\n00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:57.035\nIf you don't keep track of where you are,\nand\n\n20\n00:00:57.035 --> 00:01:01.905\nwhat's developing in the industry, you're\ngonna get kind of stuck really quickly.\n\n21\n00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:06.690\nAnd you're gonna end up at a point where\nyou're either you know, out of touch or\n\n22\n00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.580\nout of date or both, and\nthat's just not where you want to be.\n\n23\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.410\nThat's a big role to hurt,\nyou know happening right there.\n\n24\n00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.590\nSo we want to make sure that\nyou're where you need to be.\n\n25\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.870\nSo what we're talking about here\nare things that you need to stay aware of,\n\n26\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.320\nand also kind of showing\nyou some of the sources and\n\n27\n00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.090\nthings you could be doing to keep yourself\nup to date and keep your skills sharp.\n\n28\n00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.660\nThis is probably, in fact I'm\nnot even going to say probably,\n\n29\n00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.650\nI'm just gonna go right for\nthe jugular on this one.\n\n30\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.740\nWhenever I'm consulting with someone or\nI'm bringing up new people in this field,\n\n31\n00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.150\nyou know training people to a,\nin the classroom or\n\n32\n00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.120\nwhatever, one of the things I\nalways make a big deal about is,\n\n33\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.560\nis I can teach anybody the technology, and\nit's not me bragging or anything here.\n\n34\n00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.430\nI can teach anybody the technology,\nthe techniques.\n\n35\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.196\nI don't think that from my\nviewpoint that's the hard thing,\n\n36\n00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:01.120\nbecause those that draw well documented.\n\n37\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.390\nIf you wanna put in the time and learn how\nto run the commands, how to do things and\n\n38\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.240\nwhat to look for, you're in good shape.\n\n39\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.770\nHowever, those skills, you know,\nto keep using our word for the day,\n\n40\n00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.860\nare perishable.\n\n41\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.910\nIf you don't keep using them,\nyou will lose them.\n\n42\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.550\nYou know, use it or\nlose it, as the saying says.\n\n43\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.110\nSo, what you have to do is, you have to\nfind a way to stay on top of things and\n\n44\n00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.280\nmake sure that you are keeping\nthose skills nice and sharp.\n\n45\n00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.320\nSo while I can sit here and\nI've always said, with anybody, I'm\n\n46\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.850\nwilling to sit down with you and help you\nlearn the stuff and get you up to speed.\n\n47\n00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.020\nBut, I can only do so much for you.\n\n48\n00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.730\nI can't be with you all the time.\n\n49\n00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.100\nYou have to have that curiosity and\nthat drive to stay up to date.\n\n50\n00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.180\nThat's all on you.\n\n51\n00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.160\nThat's the tough part.\n\n52\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.520\nYou gotta have to dig deep and\nsee if that's what you're willing to do,\n\n53\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.980\nbecause it is almost\nanother full time job.\n\n54\n00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.350\nMaybe two full time jobs and\nnot what you're already doing.\n\n55\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.900\n>> It is a fast-paced changing\narea of study isn't it?\n\n56\n00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.851\n>> Yeah it's like watching\nFormula One just go whipping by.\n\n57\n00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.284\n[LAUGH]\n>> I pictured you know,\n\n58\n00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:08.783\nwhen you said that, I was thinking,\nthere goes Sean on a little motorcycle and\n\n59\n00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:11.190\nhe's got somebody in\nthat side car with him.\n\n60\n00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.430\nAnd he can get you where you need to be,\nbut you know, once his training ends,\n\n61\n00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.810\nit's like that side car has detached and\n\n62\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.580\nnow you gotta figure out some\nway to keep that thing going, or\n\n63\n00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.450\nyou're just gonna coast off the side\nof the road and kind of be stuck there.\n\n64\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.000\nBut it's very true.\n\n65\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.300\nSecurity especially against technologies\nchange and the vulnerabilities change.\n\n66\n00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.860\nThings that worked against XP for\nexample, don't work against Windows 8.\n\n67\n00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.170\nSo I might have all that knowledge\nabout all these vulnerabilities or\n\n68\n00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.630\nprotecting Windows XP, not gonna do me\na lot of good in the world of Windows 8.1.\n\n69\n00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.080\n>> Yeah, they're just not.\n\n70\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.100\nSome things carry through.\n\n71\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.060\nYou know you might get lucky and so\nyou might find that one you know,\n\n72\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.720\nthing that carry through between all\nthose releases and they do happen, but\n\n73\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.520\nthat's, that's not the norm.\n\n74\n00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.540\nThose are exceptions so\nyou have to be on your game and\n\n75\n00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.600\nbe ready to deal with the very dynamic and\nvery fluid and very challenging area.\n\n76\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.470\nAnd you've got to have that curiosity and\ndrive.\n\n77\n00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.290\nYou don't have it,\nI can't give that to you.\n\n78\n00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.680\nI can't teach you how to be that way,\nno matter how hard or\n\n79\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.700\nhow much I'd wanna do that.\n\n80\n00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.560\nI can't give that to you.\n\n81\n00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.300\nEither you got the drive and\nthe curiosity or you don't, and that's it.\n\n82\n00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.090\n>> Yeah, and we've both taught quite\na few, and it's one of the things I've\n\n83\n00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.500\nalways stressed to my students,\nwas you got to like to learn.\n\n84\n00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.960\nEspecially computers in general\nbecause they change so fast.\n\n85\n00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.060\nAnd in security?\n\n86\n00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.910\nYou have to be on it all the time, so\nyou really have to enjoy learning,\n\n87\n00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.270\nbecause if you don't as you said,\nyou don't use it, you lose it.\n\n88\n00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.860\nAnd you've got to stay up.\n\n89\n00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.000\nIndustry trends is one place that\nwe can get information from.\n\n90\n00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.640\n>> Yeah, you definitely have to stay\non top of the latest technology,\n\n91\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.770\nthe latest gadgets that may show up.\n\n92\n00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.050\nYou're going to have to plug in and\n\n93\n00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.840\ndo research to see how people\nare using those technologies.\n\n94\n00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.064\nAnd you know, threats that are actually\nshowing up, you'll have to look at\n\n95\n00:04:57.064 --> 00:05:01.590\nall those things across the board and\nsee you know, how that affects you.\n\n96\n00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.570\nFortunately, they've made it\neasier than it used to be,\n\n97\n00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.540\nbut it's still is going\nto require some effort.\n\n98\n00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.360\nYou can work smarter then\nyou instead of harder,\n\n99\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.160\nas hard you did before, but doesn't mean\nthat you still don't have a lot of work.\n\n100\n00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.060\nIt just means you have a little less work,\nbut you still got a lot of work.\n\n101\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.210\nAnd you know one of the things that\nI've pointed out over the years,\n\n102\n00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.950\nwhen I know you teach the same stuff and\n\n103\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.690\nthe same thing too is that, you get people\nthat get a natural progression through IT,\n\n104\n00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.580\nthey start at the grassroots and they\nmove through network administration and\n\n105\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.760\nactive directory or what have you, and\nthen some point decide they are going\n\n106\n00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.620\nto go into security, if that's\nthe path they're choosing of course.\n\n107\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.220\nOne of the things that you gotta train\nthose people right when they come in is\n\n108\n00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.540\nright on the statement I was just talking\nabout, because why I'm kind of careful\n\n109\n00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.315\nnot to give that entire\nimpression on this.\n\n110\n00:05:55.315 --> 00:05:58.595\nYou can pretty much once you learn\nsomething like Acra Directory or Windows,\n\n111\n00:05:58.595 --> 00:06:01.075\nyou can skate to a certain degree.\n\n112\n00:06:01.075 --> 00:06:01.645\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n113\n00:06:01.645 --> 00:06:04.215\n>> Doesn't change dramatically,\nit changes, yes.\n\n114\n00:06:04.215 --> 00:06:07.135\nBut it's not like this big shift and\neverything and\n\n115\n00:06:07.135 --> 00:06:10.345\nit's not flying at you,\nyou know like crazy.\n\n116\n00:06:10.345 --> 00:06:14.284\nSecurity is you know,\nwhen you cross that line in the sand and\n\n117\n00:06:14.284 --> 00:06:16.990\nyou're going over to that side.\n\n118\n00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.870\nOh, yeah, it's now, you're dropping it.\n\n119\n00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.560\nYou've gone to a whole\nnew world on many fronts.\n\n120\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.940\nSo it progresses incredibly fast.\n\n121\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.110\n>> Absolutely, and I've told people\nthe exact same thing, Shawn, where\n\n122\n00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.810\nActive Directory, they'll ask me, well,\nhow hard is that Active Directory exam?\n\n123\n00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.492\nWell, it's relative, right, because I've\nbeen studying Active Directory since 2000,\n\n124\n00:06:38.492 --> 00:06:41.800\nand 80% of Active Directory\nhasn't changed.\n\n125\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.690\nIt's OUs and user accounts,\nand computer accounts.\n\n126\n00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.870\nThere's new bells and whistles, and so\nI got to learn some new information, but\n\n127\n00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.900\nother than that,\nit's still Active Directory.\n\n128\n00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.620\nDNS still works the same way it did\nwhen I got started in this back in 2000.\n\n129\n00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.170\nSo yeah, I've gotta learn DNS SEC and\n\n130\n00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.080\nthings like that, but\nthe basics are still there.\n\n131\n00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.160\nWhen it comes to security,\nyou don't get that luxury.\n\n132\n00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.470\nIt is.\n\n133\n00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.637\n>> Nope.\n>> You know, the background knowledge and\n\n134\n00:07:05.637 --> 00:07:08.960\nall of that is very important, but\nyou have got to stay on top of your game.\n\n135\n00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.340\nYou can't skate in this one.\n\n136\n00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.190\n>> Yeah that bedrock stays the same but\nall the stuff above that it's,\n\n137\n00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.430\nit can be a free for all.\n\n138\n00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.550\nSome stuff carries through,\nbut don't expect it.\n\n139\n00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.350\nYou know?\nI mean heck,\n\n140\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.990\nif you think about it you probably pick\nup a, because it sounds like you and\n\n141\n00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.090\nI started in Active Directory\nabout the same time.\n\n142\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.638\nYou know, I was working with the\npre-release before and stuff like that so\n\n143\n00:07:28.638 --> 00:07:30.851\nyou know around the 2000s stuff in there.\n\n144\n00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:32.634\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> You can probably pick up a book for\n\n145\n00:07:32.634 --> 00:07:35.032\nWindows 2000 Active Directory and\nstill use it.\n\n146\n00:07:35.032 --> 00:07:36.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And not be really that far off.\n\n147\n00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.269\nYou could probably get, for\nall intentsive purposes,\n\n148\n00:07:40.269 --> 00:07:42.912\nthat we go by your percentage in there.\n\n149\n00:07:42.912 --> 00:07:44.080\nThat's 20%.\n\n150\n00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.059\nHow many people, really,\nare ever going to really see that 20%.\n\n151\n00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:50.710\n>> Right.\n>> It's probably going to be in that 80%,\n\n152\n00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.470\nthat they're going to be in, and\nthey're not going to know the difference.\n\n153\n00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.660\nIf you crossed out 2000 something.\n\n154\n00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.910\nDon't worry about it.\n\n155\n00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.328\n>> Now don't mistake that for the exams.\n\n156\n00:07:58.328 --> 00:08:01.933\nIf you're studying for the certification,\nMicrosoft will ask you about that 20%.\n\n157\n00:08:01.933 --> 00:08:06.066\nWe're talking about in the real world, you\ncould still function with that knowledge.\n\n158\n00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:07.924\n>> I used to always joke\naround Microsoft exams.\n\n159\n00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:08.822\nI kid you not.\n\n160\n00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:12.651\n[LAUGH] I still to this day when someone\nasks me because you know obviously we\n\n161\n00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:15.490\ncan't tell them what's on there but\nI tell them to go,\n\n162\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.190\nwhat type of things on the exam?\n\n163\n00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.270\nI said, well here's how you get an idea.\n\n164\n00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.830\nGo up to their site and\nfind the product on their site and\n\n165\n00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.908\nall the new features they talk about,\nthat's what they're gonna ask on there.\n\n166\n00:08:25.908 --> 00:08:27.150\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly right.\n\n167\n00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.570\nYou know now you've got down\nhere analyzing trends and\n\n168\n00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.440\noutlining potential impact.\n\n169\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.314\nSo we're talking about like I see in\nthe industry this trend towards using\n\n170\n00:08:36.314 --> 00:08:37.266\nbiometrics.\n\n171\n00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:40.781\nSo I want to start looking at biometrics\nand start looking at vulnerabilities\n\n172\n00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:44.470\nbecause I know it's a matter of time\nbefore my boss comes to me and says.\n\n173\n00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:45.800\nWe're going to implement biometrics.\n\n174\n00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.300\nIs that where we're headed here?\n\n175\n00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.130\n>> That is a definite part of the equation\nis how things are going to impact you\n\n176\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.820\nbecause really every piece of technology,\nevery trend,\n\n177\n00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.240\neverything's going to impact you\nin some way, shape, or form.\n\n178\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.110\nAnd you can pretty much count on\nthat security you know every time\n\n179\n00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.790\nmanagement comes up with some crazy idea.\n\n180\n00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.580\nLike I said that's going to impact you.\n\n181\n00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.820\nThey're gonna, you know,\nbring your own device.\n\n182\n00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.539\nI pretty much think bringing your\nown device was management trying to\n\n183\n00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:12.380\ntick us off.\n\n184\n00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.950\n[LAUGH] What I really want to say that.\n\n185\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.360\nIt's not that we can't afford it.\n\n186\n00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.120\nIt's like, it's worth the price of\nadmission to watch security guys go nuts\n\n187\n00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.850\nand the IT guys go nuts.\n\n188\n00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.620\nI think that's where that came from.,\nat least in my opinion.\n\n189\n00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.460\nSo but\nthose things can cause huge frustrations.\n\n190\n00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.850\nThat was something that's\na management thing.\n\n191\n00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.800\nThen you have things like trends like\nmore people remote and being extended.\n\n192\n00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.930\nAnd remote, when I think of remote for\n\n193\n00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:46.030\nsome reason even now it's my thinking,\nit's my hang up on it but when I\n\n194\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:51.560\nthink of remote I still think of someone\nsitting there just not working there.\n\n195\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.240\nThey're fixing, and they're either working\nin a location that's, of course, remote.\n\n196\n00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.510\nBut it's a fixed location like at home or\nsomething.\n\n197\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.610\nThat's what I tend to think.\n\n198\n00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:04.060\nAnd yeah, I know you get\nthe ones that move around, but\n\n199\n00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.030\nstill tends to be like a finite one.\n\n200\n00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.820\nWe don't have that anymore.\n\n201\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.760\nWe have remote, of course but\nwe don't have just that situation anymore.\n\n202\n00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.870\nOne of the trends has been,\nwhen they say mobile, people are mobile,\n\n203\n00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.250\nthat really is significant.\n\n204\n00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.440\nIt's not someone just sitting at home or\nsitting at a hotel some place and\n\n205\n00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.570\nbeing here and there, and\nchecking things now and then.\n\n206\n00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.320\nIt's someone that's got that cell phone,\ngot that tablet, got that laptop,\n\n207\n00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.930\ngot Wi-Fi everywhere they need it to be,\nand they can be anywhere.\n\n208\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.970\nWhen I left here last time,\nand was flying home,\n\n209\n00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:45.290\nI was emailing people on the ground, and\nsending manuscripts to the guy back and\n\n210\n00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.190\nforth, for\none of the books I'm working on.\n\n211\n00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.180\nI was doing those things.\n\n212\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.080\nThat's about as mobile as you can get.\n\n213\n00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.930\nPeople say, hey, where are you?\n\n214\n00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:54.580\nIdaho?\n\n215\n00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.240\n>> At 30,000 feet?\n\n216\n00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.280\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n217\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.440\nI'm in Nevada right now.\n\n218\n00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.230\nWhere in Nevada?\n\n219\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.895\nAbout 35, 34, somewhere in there.\n\n220\n00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:03.987\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's a great example of how things\n\n221\n00:11:03.987 --> 00:11:05.900\nchange, cuz you're absolutely right.\n\n222\n00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.970\nYou know, we used to think,\nokay, I'm gonna work and\n\n223\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.690\nwhen I get home I can do work but\nnow I can do work at the coffee shop.\n\n224\n00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.677\nI can do work while somebody\nelse is driving my car, right.\n\n225\n00:11:13.677 --> 00:11:15.651\nI wouldn't be doing anything\nwhile I was driving.\n\n226\n00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:17.357\nFlying, it's crazy.\n\n227\n00:11:17.357 --> 00:11:21.361\nSo you got to keep it just another point,\nand Shawn's is,\n\n228\n00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:26.950\nevery time we take a break between our\nepisodes here, Shawn's on his computer.\n\n229\n00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.440\nShawn's on the phone.\n\n230\n00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.300\nAnd he's not doing text messages he's hey,\ndid you see this article on hacker today?\n\n231\n00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.000\n[LAUGH] Hey, did you see this on here?\n\n232\n00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.620\nHey, did you see this on here?\n\n233\n00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:41.500\nIt's just a constant thing and that's\nreally Shawn what you have to do, right?\n\n234\n00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.290\n>> That is what you have to do.\n\n235\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.676\nNow I may be you know,\na little fanatical or crazy about it.\n\n236\n00:11:46.676 --> 00:11:49.190\n[LAUGH] I know ex-girlfriends\nhave accused me of that.\n\n237\n00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:54.210\n[LAUGH] That I'm on the stuff too much but\nI do have an enjoyment.\n\n238\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.180\nI really do enjoy doing\nthis type of thing and\n\n239\n00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.370\nthat's something that\nhopefully you get out of it.\n\n240\n00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.050\nBecause it's actually going\nto give you the extra drive.\n\n241\n00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.019\nHopefully it's not about the dollar signs.\n\n242\n00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:05.640\nBecause that burns out pretty quickly.\n\n243\n00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.730\nBut we all like to make money and\nwe enjoy it but if that's your\n\n244\n00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.070\nmotivation that's gonna, sole motivation\nis going to burn you out in this field.\n\n245\n00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:17.808\nSo, that means your not going to do a good\njob so you won't make money all that long.\n\n246\n00:12:17.808 --> 00:12:21.008\n[LAUGH] So you,\nI really truly enjoy it and\n\n247\n00:12:21.008 --> 00:12:25.250\nI think I'm also kinda of at\nthe way of moving around.\n\n248\n00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:30.442\nI do I'm kind of representative of the no\n\n249\n00:12:30.442 --> 00:12:36.790\nlonger remote,\nnow I'm a truly mobile user.\n\n250\n00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:42.420\nI've made comments before with what I do,\nI don't have really an office,\n\n251\n00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:48.280\nyou know well,\nI've got one next to my pool.\n\n252\n00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.036\n>> [LAUGH] When's the last\ntime you saw your office?\n\n253\n00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:52.970\n[LAUGH]\n>> We've held you here captive for\n\n254\n00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:53.840\nat least a month.\n\n255\n00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.430\n>> Yeah I probably, I've seen it.\n\n256\n00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:57.420\nI know it exists.\n\n257\n00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.370\nYeah, so I've got that.\n\n258\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.140\nBut you look at the way I am,\n\n259\n00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.970\nI was here, we did the Cadena Metasploit\na couple weeks ago.\n\n260\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.740\nI was home doing stuff for\na couple of weeks.\n\n261\n00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.978\nCame back here doing this and\nI go home for like a.\n\n262\n00:13:13.978 --> 00:13:17.393\nIn fact, when I went home last time\nI went out to drill for the guard.\n\n263\n00:13:17.393 --> 00:13:20.325\nI'm doing that and I come back doing\nsome other stuff, bouncing around.\n\n264\n00:13:20.325 --> 00:13:24.037\nAfter here I go home for\nabout five days and then I'm going over.\n\n265\n00:13:24.037 --> 00:13:27.171\nI know you guys are gonna be heartbroken,\nI'm going over to Hawaii.\n\n266\n00:13:27.171 --> 00:13:28.850\n[LAUGH] So, and\nI'm taking all my work up to,\n\n267\n00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.970\ntaking all my stuff with\nme to go over there.\n\n268\n00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.678\n>> Should we all break out\nthe little pity party for him?\n\n269\n00:13:34.678 --> 00:13:38.014\n>> Don't worry I'll post\npictures of Waikiki Beach for\n\n270\n00:13:38.014 --> 00:13:43.360\nyou guys on the IT Pro webpage, because\nI'm thinking about you, and I care.\n\n271\n00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.129\n>> [LAUGH] You know with the resources\nthat are available nowadays,\n\n272\n00:13:47.129 --> 00:13:50.320\nyou can almost be just as\neffective on the road.\n\n273\n00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.040\n>> Yeah and\nthat's the point is that when I, for\n\n274\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.100\nall intensive purposes, except for\nme joking around about it a bit.\n\n275\n00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.533\nI don't have to tell anyone I'm in Hawaii.\n\n276\n00:14:02.533 --> 00:14:04.110\nI don't have to tell anyone wherever I am.\n\n277\n00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:08.440\nI've got a phone, you can get a hold of me\nany place and I've got WiFi every place so\n\n278\n00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.930\nI can respond to anything any place.\n\n279\n00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.160\nDoesn't matter, it really doesn't matter.\n\n280\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.200\nYou're always on and all that, and\nthat's the world that we're in.\n\n281\n00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.660\n>> And for\nsecurity that definitely has an impact.\n\n282\n00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:25.384\nYou've got people all over the place and\nwe don't know where they are necessarily\n\n283\n00:14:25.384 --> 00:14:29.508\nall the time, and we don't have to\nknow where they all are all the time.\n\n284\n00:14:29.508 --> 00:14:34.044\nWhen I'm doing the stuff,\nif you take this stuff in Hawaii for\n\n285\n00:14:34.044 --> 00:14:37.286\nexample, no one literally is no one there.\n\n286\n00:14:37.286 --> 00:14:41.286\nAnd so I can be in a hotel,\nI can be on the beach, be wherever, and\n\n287\n00:14:41.286 --> 00:14:45.291\nbe talking on the phone and\nsending messages back and forth, and\n\n288\n00:14:45.291 --> 00:14:49.060\nno one really needs to know,\nit's insignificant.\n\n289\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.040\nYeah, I'm over there, but\nit's insignificant where it is,\n\n290\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.082\nbecause it doesn't matter.\n\n291\n00:14:53.082 --> 00:14:55.590\nThey can get a hold of me,\nthey can send stuff back and forth.\n\n292\n00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.830\nI can crack open the computer, I can work\nfrom there, it's completely transparent.\n\n293\n00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.420\nI mean heck, I think except for\nlike what, the four hours,\n\n294\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.080\nfive hours I'm running a race,\nthat's the only time I'll be unavailable.\n\n295\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.552\nSo [COUGH] that's it.\n\n296\n00:15:07.552 --> 00:15:10.880\n>> Now David's in the chatroom saying\nhe's gonna fire up Echo Set and\n\n297\n00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.030\nhe's going to know right where you are.\n\n298\n00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.780\nYou already taught us\nsome of your cool tricks.\n\n299\n00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.776\n>> Well, [LAUGH] if you can\nfigure out what I'm doing.\n\n300\n00:15:15.776 --> 00:15:16.472\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n301\n00:15:16.472 --> 00:15:19.537\nwhen it comes to performing\non-going reasearch.\n\n302\n00:15:19.537 --> 00:15:20.860\n>> I should do that during a race, right.\n\n303\n00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.060\nI should do that.\n\n304\n00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.102\nYeah, I am running a race in Hawaii,\nyeah, I'm doing that,\n\n305\n00:15:25.102 --> 00:15:28.964\nI'm doing a spartan race in Hawaii and\nI'm going to be running in the same place\n\n306\n00:15:28.964 --> 00:15:32.370\nwhere they filmed Jurassic World and\nall the stuff in there.\n\n307\n00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.790\n>> Yeah.\n>> So I might be wrestling dinosaurs\n\n308\n00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:34.524\nI don't know.\n\n309\n00:15:34.524 --> 00:15:38.975\n[LAUGH] But, I should be tweeting to see\nif you guys can see the path I took.\n\n310\n00:15:38.975 --> 00:15:39.942\n[LAUGH]\n>> We'll look forward to that.\n\n311\n00:15:39.942 --> 00:15:42.620\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'll be out there [LAUGH] alright go!\n\n312\n00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.091\n[LAUGH] Alright, so when it comes to\nperforming ongoing research I mean\n\n313\n00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:49.760\nthere's a ton of information out there.\n\n314\n00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.311\nWe've got this thing called the internet\nand it's out there and you can do\n\n315\n00:15:53.311 --> 00:15:57.031\nresearch, but Shawn, I know sometimes\na better way to do it is find groups and\n\n316\n00:15:57.031 --> 00:16:00.524\npeople that are in the same,\nhave the same interests, or industries and\n\n317\n00:16:00.524 --> 00:16:03.587\nthings like that and we can almost\nget the stuff streamed to us.\n\n318\n00:16:03.587 --> 00:16:09.285\n>> Yeah, and that's a tremendous benefit\nthat we didn't have a decade ago,\n\n319\n00:16:09.285 --> 00:16:13.997\nis yes, we did have things like\nRSS feeds and stuff like that.\n\n320\n00:16:13.997 --> 00:16:17.620\nBut those have grown up, and\nthen we have plenty of other things.\n\n321\n00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.410\nYes, we do have stuff like Twitter,\nFacebook and\n\n322\n00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.620\nstuff like that that can help us.\n\n323\n00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.810\nAnd I mean,\nFacebook is a really good example.\n\n324\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:30.788\nTwitter makes kinda sense because we have\nall those different people doing other\n\n325\n00:16:30.788 --> 00:16:35.264\nstuff on there, but with Facebook,\nyou might wonder how I can use that.\n\n326\n00:16:35.264 --> 00:16:40.571\nWell, I was showing during our\nlead up to this, showing Mike that\n\n327\n00:16:40.571 --> 00:16:45.795\nI really don't do much communication\nwith my friends on there.\n\n328\n00:16:45.795 --> 00:16:49.797\nYeah, I do keep on touch with\nthem on Facebook, but for\n\n329\n00:16:49.797 --> 00:16:52.842\nmy stuff in there I\nactually use it more for\n\n330\n00:16:52.842 --> 00:16:58.076\ngetting security information than\nwhat other people are using it for.\n\n331\n00:16:58.076 --> 00:17:01.010\nI go in there and\nI'm subscribed to a bunch of different or\n\n332\n00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.567\njoined a bunch of different groups\nin there that deal with security.\n\n333\n00:17:04.567 --> 00:17:08.170\nAnd so,\nI'm seeing stuff from all over the world.\n\n334\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.610\nPeople learning it,\ndifferent trends that are happening.\n\n335\n00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:14.350\nI'm seeing different underground stuff.\n\n336\n00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:17.976\nI'm seeing all sorts of things\nthat are happening, and\n\n337\n00:17:17.976 --> 00:17:20.920\nyou're even seeing different viewpoints.\n\n338\n00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.555\nSome of the stuff I look at, and they got\nviewpoints on that they're posting that\n\n339\n00:17:25.555 --> 00:17:28.635\ngroup, you're like, okay,\na little crazy there.\n\n340\n00:17:28.635 --> 00:17:30.817\nBut you're seeing that.\n\n341\n00:17:30.817 --> 00:17:36.848\nYou're seeing all these different pieces\nof information just go floating by,\n\n342\n00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:40.368\nand that's why yeah,\nI'm on Facebook a lot.\n\n343\n00:17:40.368 --> 00:17:42.900\nBut someone else would look at it and\nsay oh,\n\n344\n00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.180\nwell,yeah, he's posting on Facebook and\ndoing whatever.\n\n345\n00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.490\nNo, I'm not posting on Facebook.\n\n346\n00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:52.200\nI'm going through, but\nI'll browse through this stuff, and\n\n347\n00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.740\nit's keep me very, very,\nvery up to date on a lot of stuff.\n\n348\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.783\nBut it's not the only one.\n\n349\n00:17:56.783 --> 00:18:01.568\nThere's plenty of other things out\nthere that you can join to keep you or\n\n350\n00:18:01.568 --> 00:18:06.032\nat least favorite to keep you up to date,\nto make your life easier,\n\n351\n00:18:06.032 --> 00:18:09.050\nand that's what it's all about.\n\n352\n00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.300\n>> And I know vulnerability research\nis one area that we've really gotta\n\n353\n00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.350\nstay on top of.\n\n354\n00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:20.040\nWe depend a lot on patches and people\nto put out updates and things like that\n\n355\n00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.700\nwhen a vulnerability is discovered, but\nsometimes that might not be soon enough.\n\n356\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.590\nWe need to stay on top of that and\n\n357\n00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.590\nbe aware of this stuff, sometimes even\nbefore the patches are available.\n\n358\n00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:37.270\n>> Yeah, that's the real tricky\npart is that you can't just wait.\n\n359\n00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.420\nYou don't have that luxury if\nyou're really gonna be doing this.\n\n360\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.480\nYou don't really have that luxury of just\nwait until someone releases a patch and\n\n361\n00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.030\ngoing, oh well, good it's taken care of.\n\n362\n00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:50.230\nBy the time the patch comes out, the stuff\nthey need has already been taken from you.\n\n363\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.948\nYou're just plugging a hole after\nthe bathtub's been drained.\n\n364\n00:18:53.948 --> 00:18:58.847\nSo it's just a really\nbad situation to be in.\n\n365\n00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:00.912\nIt's not always going to be that way, and\n\n366\n00:19:00.912 --> 00:19:04.867\nyeah I tend to skew on the side of being\npessimistic rather than optimistic, but\n\n367\n00:19:04.867 --> 00:19:07.305\nI think that's kind of\nwhat you gotta be is that.\n\n368\n00:19:07.305 --> 00:19:08.775\nThat's the stuff that keeps you safe.\n\n369\n00:19:08.775 --> 00:19:10.399\nI might be paranoid.\nI might pessimistic, but\n\n370\n00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:12.811\nyou don't see me out here\nwearing a tinfoil hat either.\n\n371\n00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:14.857\nI know how to temper that.\n\n372\n00:19:14.857 --> 00:19:15.977\n>> We made him take that off.\n\n373\n00:19:15.977 --> 00:19:17.820\nIt's over, actually,\nover there off backstage.\n\n374\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.697\n>> Yeah, I lied, it's still there.\n\n375\n00:19:21.697 --> 00:19:24.716\nI was gonna wear it in here\ncuz the dog was talking to me.\n\n376\n00:19:24.716 --> 00:19:27.554\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So we got,\n\n377\n00:19:27.554 --> 00:19:31.503\nthere's a lot of websites.\n\n378\n00:19:31.503 --> 00:19:35.848\nA lot of the antivirus companies\nhave forums you can join.\n\n379\n00:19:35.848 --> 00:19:39.019\nAnd there's different places\nwhere you can join these,\n\n380\n00:19:39.019 --> 00:19:41.142\nI don't know if I'd call them clubs.\n\n381\n00:19:41.142 --> 00:19:46.509\nBut you can sign up for these news\nfeeds and stay on top of this stuff\n\n382\n00:19:46.509 --> 00:19:51.405\na lot better than looking,\nlike I said, through updates.\n\n383\n00:19:51.405 --> 00:19:55.073\nAnd technology trends is another thing\nthat we've got to stay on top of.\n\n384\n00:19:55.073 --> 00:19:57.960\n>> Yeah, there's all these trends,\nall this information.\n\n385\n00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:03.430\nIn fact, while we're talking about this,\ncuz we're talking about\n\n386\n00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.570\nthese trends and all, what are someone\nof things look like that you can use?\n\n387\n00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.600\nI know some of you got your favorites and\n\n388\n00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.730\nfeel free to post them up\nin the discussion group.\n\n389\n00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:17.610\nI'm sure everyone would like to see them.\n\n390\n00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.420\nLet me kinda show you cuz\nI brought my computer.\n\n391\n00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.400\nI brought some of\nthe different sites we've got.\n\n392\n00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.700\nI've got hackerwatch.org.\n\n393\n00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.120\nThis is one, it's very kind\nof plain vanilla, no frills.\n\n394\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.030\nBeen around for a long time.\n\n395\n00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.213\nYou can see,\nit's got interactivity maps and\n\n396\n00:20:37.213 --> 00:20:42.280\nstuff like that there that are kind of\nuseful to you to kinda take a look at.\n\n397\n00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.491\nSo we've got hackerwatch.org.\n\n398\n00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:47.365\nThat's one that's mentioned in,\n\n399\n00:20:47.365 --> 00:20:52.650\nEC council mentions that one in\ntheir official course ware a lot.\n\n400\n00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.690\nIt's not the only I'd go to,\nthere's plenty others.\n\n401\n00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:02.000\nI use this sometimes to look at stuff, but\nI also have, this is one of my favorite,\n\n402\n00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.780\nthe latesthackingnews.com.\n\n403\n00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:10.228\nI really like this one,\nand I'll tell you why this\n\n404\n00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:15.548\none's nice to have as part\nof your favorites list\n\n405\n00:21:15.548 --> 00:21:21.548\nis because this one includes\ndifferent types of news.\n\n406\n00:21:21.548 --> 00:21:27.110\nBut it also includes things on\nvulnerabilities and other type of stuff.\n\n407\n00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:31.635\nSo this is something that you\ncan take a look at to see\n\n408\n00:21:31.635 --> 00:21:35.433\nis it something that\nis gonna help you out.\n\n409\n00:21:35.433 --> 00:21:40.100\nLike I said,\nI found stuff with tutorials on here.\n\n410\n00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.810\nYou can see a video on there,\nCracking WPA/WPA2.\n\n411\n00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:49.458\nSo you find some really kind of good stuff\non there, so maybe one you wanna look at.\n\n412\n00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:53.399\nAnd then, the next one I'm\nhave here in one of my tabs,\n\n413\n00:21:53.399 --> 00:21:57.285\nthis is as old school as\nyou can get is 2600.com.\n\n414\n00:21:57.285 --> 00:22:02.107\nThis one's been around, I don't know,\nbefore they invented the Internet, so.\n\n415\n00:22:02.107 --> 00:22:07.475\n>> [LAUGH] It has been around for a while.\n\n416\n00:22:07.475 --> 00:22:09.135\n>> It's not new.\n\n417\n00:22:09.135 --> 00:22:14.925\nInterestingly enough, they publish\nthis one for years, this magazine.\n\n418\n00:22:14.925 --> 00:22:17.730\nThis magazine, it's like yay big.\n\n419\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:19.158\nUsually it's something.\n\n420\n00:22:19.158 --> 00:22:20.950\n>> It's like a little pamphlet type thing.\n\n421\n00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.388\n>> Yeah, kinda sorta, yeah.\n\n422\n00:22:22.388 --> 00:22:26.521\nIt's about the size of a Reader's Digest\nand about half as thick.\n\n423\n00:22:26.521 --> 00:22:31.791\nBut for that footprint, it's got a\ntremendous amount of information in there.\n\n424\n00:22:31.791 --> 00:22:35.089\nWhat's really cool about this one is\nthat really anybody can write for it.\n\n425\n00:22:35.089 --> 00:22:41.740\nIf you guys want to write an article for\n2600, you can do that.\n\n426\n00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.950\nAnd you'll see people that write stuff on,\n\n427\n00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.308\nthe people that write there\nit's very high quality stuff.\n\n428\n00:22:48.308 --> 00:22:54.970\nI mean, the grammar may not always\nbe on point, but who cares.\n\n429\n00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.710\nI can plow through that\nlike any of you could.\n\n430\n00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.760\nSo you can look at that stuff and\nsee some really just off the wall stuff,\n\n431\n00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.500\nsome neat stuff from all different\nsorts of technology enthusiasts and\n\n432\n00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.600\npeople that are hacking.\n\n433\n00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.700\nThere's people in here that\nlegitimately are truly hackers.\n\n434\n00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.830\nThey try to kind of avoid\nsome of the black hat stuff,\n\n435\n00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:18.030\nbut it does come into here.\n\n436\n00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.982\nSo it's a really, really good resource,\nand you can go all the way back,\n\n437\n00:23:22.982 --> 00:23:24.764\nif you want to their first issue.\n\n438\n00:23:24.764 --> 00:23:28.804\nFor first issue,\nthe digital archives are still available.\n\n439\n00:23:28.804 --> 00:23:30.569\n>> Do some phone freaking and\nall that good stuff?\n\n440\n00:23:30.569 --> 00:23:32.566\n>> Yeah, so\nthey're actually kind of funny.\n\n441\n00:23:32.566 --> 00:23:33.810\nYou can still get that.\n\n442\n00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:38.390\nIn fact, I think you can go\ninto their store on here.\n\n443\n00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:44.270\nI think if you go into the store, I don't\nknow if they have, if they show it here.\n\n444\n00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.290\nBut you mentioned about\nthe phone freaking, yeah,\n\n445\n00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:49.270\nthere's the hacker calendars.\n\n446\n00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:52.672\nTheir hacker calendars have stuff\nlike phones and and stuff like that.\n\n447\n00:23:52.672 --> 00:23:55.786\nOne of their ongoing features\nthat they have every quarter,\n\n448\n00:23:55.786 --> 00:23:58.961\nthey do something on payphones\nwhere people take pictures and\n\n449\n00:23:58.961 --> 00:24:01.600\nsubmit them in places where\nthey found payphones.\n\n450\n00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.819\nI don't know what the fascination is but\n[LAUGH] it is what it is.\n\n451\n00:24:04.819 --> 00:24:06.178\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they have a calendar.\n\n452\n00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:10.702\nThe one they just, the newest calendar\nwhich that was a picture of it,\n\n453\n00:24:10.702 --> 00:24:13.860\nits got hey,\nhere's 12 months of calendars.\n\n454\n00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.240\nI guess its kind of like you know.\n\n455\n00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know geek porn?\n\n456\n00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.200\nI don't know whatever you call it.\n\n457\n00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.241\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's whatever but they got that.\n\n458\n00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.240\nBut still,\nthose aren't the only ones you've got.\n\n459\n00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.910\nOne other informational site, and I know\na lot of you probably know this one,\n\n460\n00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:34.510\nis darknet.org.uk.\n\n461\n00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:38.665\nThis is one It's been around for\na long time.\n\n462\n00:24:38.665 --> 00:24:41.935\nThe guy keeps it really,\nyou know, up to date.\n\n463\n00:24:41.935 --> 00:24:45.355\nYou can see he just published\nsomething you know,\n\n464\n00:24:45.355 --> 00:24:49.820\non this FruityWifi tool\nposted fifth of August, so.\n\n465\n00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.030\nYou know, we're talking,\nhe just published it, you know,\n\n466\n00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.035\nbecause of where he is in the UK,\nit's what, tomorrow.\n\n467\n00:24:56.035 --> 00:25:00.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So Mikhail, tell us how tomorrow is, so\n\n468\n00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.032\nI can dress appropriately.\n\n469\n00:25:03.032 --> 00:25:06.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but that's one that's been around.\n\n470\n00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:09.685\nI found this one very very very\nuseful because he talks about tools,\n\n471\n00:25:09.685 --> 00:25:13.501\nevaluates them, and even has sections\non there and different tutorials and\n\n472\n00:25:13.501 --> 00:25:15.304\nstuff like that you can go through.\n\n473\n00:25:15.304 --> 00:25:18.264\nSo I find it really\nreally handy to have and\n\n474\n00:25:18.264 --> 00:25:22.252\nyou know, maybe that's gonna\nbe part of your toolkit.\n\n475\n00:25:22.252 --> 00:25:26.898\n>> And that's the thing,\nover time in whatever is useful to you in\n\n476\n00:25:26.898 --> 00:25:30.667\nwhatever field or\nindustry you happen to be in, and\n\n477\n00:25:30.667 --> 00:25:35.428\nyou start going there regularly and\ngetting that information.\n\n478\n00:25:35.428 --> 00:25:39.700\nSo you know, not that it's difficult\nto stay up on all of this information,\n\n479\n00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.260\nI mean there's a lot of it,\n\n480\n00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.320\nbut you've just got to put forth with that\neffort, you gotta make sure you're trying.\n\n481\n00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.190\n>> Yeah,\nyou gotta leverage your resources.\n\n482\n00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.646\nIf you don't, you're gonna be overwhelmed.\n\n483\n00:25:49.646 --> 00:25:54.160\nSo, just, [LAUGH] as the saying goes and\nI hate it but,\n\n484\n00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.390\nwork smarter not harder and\nthat really is the name of the game.\n\n485\n00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:03.990\nYou know, I say I personally it's kind\nof like a half jokingly type thing.\n\n486\n00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.350\nI say that I go into and\nfound all these websites and\n\n487\n00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:11.965\nresources not because I wanted to do more\nwork, but because I wanted to be lazy.\n\n488\n00:26:11.965 --> 00:26:15.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I found shortcuts to do everything,\n\n489\n00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.465\ncuz I don't want anything cutting\ninto my laying around time.\n\n490\n00:26:18.465 --> 00:26:19.836\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n491\n00:26:19.836 --> 00:26:21.040\n>> Kaitlin in our chat room\n\n492\n00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.150\nbrings up another good point.\n\n493\n00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.600\nPodcasts from different,\nvarious companies and vendors.\n\n494\n00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.820\nIt's another great resource.\n\n495\n00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.250\nThose things, I can download to my\ndevice and can listen while I'm driving.\n\n496\n00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.880\nSo, I can be productive while I'm\ntraveling and things like that.\n\n497\n00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.050\n>> Yeah, you definitely can\nleverage a lot of stuff.\n\n498\n00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:40.580\nSo that's what's cool.\n\n499\n00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.190\nAnd then just a couple other,\n\n500\n00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:47.720\nwell actually three other websites\nI was going to bring up in here.\n\n501\n00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:53.440\nis this is stuff that you can do and\nI know we talked about that Metasploitable\n\n502\n00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:00.530\nfor example in our In our Metasploit\ncourse and did some stuff in Kali.\n\n503\n00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.380\nWell there's also other things\nout there you can use, too.\n\n504\n00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.970\nThis is one, this is WebGoat,\nthis has been around for ages,\n\n505\n00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.090\nit's gone through multiple versions.\n\n506\n00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:15.000\nIt's something that's really designed for\nyou to beat on it, just like\n\n507\n00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.730\nMetasploitable is, with the idea of being,\nyou beat on it, and you find the holes.\n\n508\n00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.630\nThey tell you where the holes are, and\nthen you can see if you can uncover\n\n509\n00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.770\nthe holes using your own, so\nyou gotta be disciplined, I mean,\n\n510\n00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:30.690\nyou know where they are, but you gotta act\nlike once you know where they are, okay,\n\n511\n00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.210\nlet me see if I can kind of uncover it and\nsee what happens.\n\n512\n00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:38.210\nSo that's a good one, you can download\nthat, and load that in to VMware,\n\n513\n00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:43.600\nwhatever your virtualization package is,\nand try it out.\n\n514\n00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.898\nAnd then you've got this one,\nthe Damn Vulnerable iOS Application.\n\n515\n00:27:47.898 --> 00:27:52.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know, I find it a little humorous\n\n516\n00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:57.040\nthat, that it's the iOS\nVulnerable Application.\n\n517\n00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.805\nSo iOS, you know Apple,\nit's nickname kind of looks like Diva.\n\n518\n00:28:01.805 --> 00:28:05.078\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Kind of appropriate,\n\n519\n00:28:05.078 --> 00:28:06.620\ndon't you think?\n\n520\n00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, so\n\n521\n00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.040\nyou've got this one to\nactually to test stuff out on.\n\n522\n00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.000\nSo that's kind of neat.\n\n523\n00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.450\nThey tell you right there.\n\n524\n00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:20.030\nThey also have the Damn Vulnerable\niOS application,\n\n525\n00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:25.370\nthey also have this one\nDamn Vulnerable Linux, all you have to do\n\n526\n00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:30.450\nis Google that one, Damn Vulnerable Linux\nand you will be able to grab that.\n\n527\n00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.860\nThis is again, it's something that's\ndesigned, so they discontinued it.\n\n528\n00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.625\nBut they've got the Damn Vulnerable Linux,\n\n529\n00:28:36.625 --> 00:28:39.160\nthey've got the Damn Vulnerable\nweb application.\n\n530\n00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.165\nThere's a lot of damning going on.\n\n531\n00:28:41.165 --> 00:28:42.256\nSomeone's having a bad day.\n\n532\n00:28:42.256 --> 00:28:42.757\n>> Not happy.\n\n533\n00:28:42.757 --> 00:28:46.569\n[LAUGH]\n>> So you've got those to pound on and\n\n534\n00:28:46.569 --> 00:28:51.383\nyou know, you can keep going on and\non and on with this.\n\n535\n00:28:51.383 --> 00:28:56.040\nYou know, we're trying to kind of put\nforth here, is that one of the things for\n\n536\n00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.740\nyour ongoing research is\nkeeping on top of the tools,\n\n537\n00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:05.140\nas well as trying these tools\nto see what you actually get.\n\n538\n00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.750\nYou know, so that was some of\nthe various tools out there.\n\n539\n00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:12.296\nThere's even one for Android if you\nwant to get into, there's one for\n\n540\n00:29:12.296 --> 00:29:16.844\nAndroid called App Use, It's a p p u s c,\nI can't think of the name, or\n\n541\n00:29:16.844 --> 00:29:18.410\nthe website right now.\n\n542\n00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:23.190\nBut you can just Google App USE and\nthey have a paid version, so\n\n543\n00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:26.620\ndon't freak out if you go the web page and\nit says, oh now here's the pro version and\n\n544\n00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:30.930\nit costs you know more than you'll make in\na year something like that, I don't know.\n\n545\n00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.856\nThey've put some costs there.\n\n546\n00:29:32.856 --> 00:29:33.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think\n\n547\n00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.970\nthey put some costs there with it.\n\n548\n00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.360\nBut there is a pay version.\n\n549\n00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.890\nBut there's also a free version\nthat you can use as well.\n\n550\n00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:44.320\nSo you've got that and then if you want\nto test against Android platforms,\n\n551\n00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.250\nby the way,\n\n552\n00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:50.000\nIf that's something that's your next\ngoal to do, which it really should be.\n\n553\n00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.030\nMobile devices should be the next thing\nyou're doing pen testing against,\n\n554\n00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:58.440\ndo remember that there's also\nmany tutorials online for\n\n555\n00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.600\nthis, so I won't worry about it now.\n\n556\n00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.510\nBut there's a,\n\n557\n00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:05.010\nyou can install the different version\nof the Android operating system,\n\n558\n00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:10.490\nyou can install those right inside of VM\nware, and just pound the heck out of them.\n\n559\n00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:14.320\nYou do need to have a little bit of\na higher level of knowledge that just\n\n560\n00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.240\nnormal for\ninstalling something like Windows,\n\n561\n00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.210\nor just regular generic Linux,\nbut it's not that difficult.\n\n562\n00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:24.490\nI think anyone of you in here could\nfigure it out and be ready to go.\n\n563\n00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.840\nBut, it's not something that\njust slips right in and works.\n\n564\n00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.770\nYou still do have to do\na little bit of prep for\n\n565\n00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.790\nit, but it works with any\nvirtualization platform you want.\n\n566\n00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:38.660\nYou can download any version\nof Android as an ISO file.\n\n567\n00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:39.240\n>> Very good, all right.\n\n568\n00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.320\nWell a lot of great information, remember\npart of the game in being in security is\n\n569\n00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.820\nstaying on top of everything,\nand that means\n\n570\n00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.620\npaying attention to the latest trends and\nthe technologies that are coming out.\n\n571\n00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.210\nAnd staying on top of the research and the\nvulnerabilities and things like that, so\n\n572\n00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.390\nthat we can try to stay\nahead of the bad guys.\n\n573\n00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:58.230\nThat's the whole game there.\n\n574\n00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.430\nSo, anything thing else we need to throw\nin here Sean before we wrap this one up?\n\n575\n00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:06.020\n>> I think we pretty nailed it on that one\nwe have there's a lot of stuff in there,\n\n576\n00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.570\nwe were dumping a lot of stuff in the bag\nthere like just kick it down a bit and\n\n577\n00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.626\ncrunch down put some more stuff on top\n>> We'll rewind that\n\n578\n00:31:11.626 --> 00:31:12.160\none\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n579\n00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.180\n>> And watch it one or two more times so.\n\n580\n00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.420\nAlright well ladies and gentleman we\nhope you enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n581\n00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.670\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n582\n00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:20.440\n>> And I'm Sean Ariano.\n\n583\n00:31:20.440

00:00:14.338\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.338 --> 00:00:15.779\nWith me today is Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:16.846\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:16.846 --> 00:00:18.234\n>> Doing pretty good, how are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:19.241\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:23.140\nWe've got another exciting CompTIA\nAdvanced Security Practitioner episode\n\n9\n00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.500\ncoming your way.\n\n10\n00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.310\nThis one,\nwe're gonna continue on talking about.\n\n11\n00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.980\nActually, we're heading into, gosh,\nI almost forgot, legal guidelines.\n\n12\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.560\nSounds fun and exciting,\n\n13\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.600\nbut it is something that we\nhave to be aware of right?\n\n14\n00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.960\nWe have to make sure we're not,\nif we're trying to catch the bad guys or\n\n15\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.690\nwe're worried about security and\nkeeping safe from the bad guys,\n\n16\n00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.760\nwe can't break the law either.\n\n17\n00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.600\n>> Yeah, we're kind of coming\nat this from a different angle.\n\n18\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.400\nI mean, I know when people hear legal,\n\n19\n00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.190\nyou start hearing brains turn off and\nstuff like that.\n\n20\n00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.990\nBut we're coming at this\nfrom a different angle,\n\n21\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.000\nso don't get worried yet\nand go, this again?\n\n22\n00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.590\nNo, there's a little more to it than that.\n\n23\n00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.360\nWhat we're talking about for\nlegal guidelines here is,\n\n24\n00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.650\nwe're talking about things that have\nbeen established that are going to help,\n\n25\n00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.140\nhopefully act as, you know, as a kind\nof best practice kind of sort of thing\n\n26\n00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.020\nthat gets you down the road towards,\nyou know, having a successful\n\n27\n00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.180\nencounter with the law rather than have\nyou know where you're on the other\n\n28\n00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.430\nside where you're getting penalized or\nsomething, we're trying to avoid that.\n\n29\n00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.830\nSo by doing a best practice we\ncan follow these things and\n\n30\n00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.020\nensure that certain levels of\nperformance are being adhered to.\n\n31\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.130\nThe question is, is that,\nyou know, why it's smart and\n\n32\n00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.290\nsome really great thing to habit to get\ninto it, to make sure that these things\n\n33\n00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.340\nare being, these laws are being\nfollowed the way they're suppose to.\n\n34\n00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.300\nThe question that comes for\nyou is, where do you look?\n\n35\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.330\nThat's the messy part,\nis where do you look?\n\n36\n00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.660\nI can't go to anyone of you in here and\n\n37\n00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.200\nspecifically say okay this is\nthe place where you're going to look.\n\n38\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.900\nYou have to have your own people for\nyour industry and your company,\n\n39\n00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.860\ngo look that up and figure out\nwhich way to get that information.\n\n40\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.130\nFigure out what applies to\nthem in what combination.\n\n41\n00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.670\nBecause certain combinations of stuff\nmay look like it's in black and\n\n42\n00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.500\nwhite that this is the way\nits supposed to be.\n\n43\n00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.890\nIf you start layering other stuff on\ntop of it there could be exemptions and\n\n44\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.605\nstuff like that come into play.\n\n45\n00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:32.595\nHIPAA is one that is\na good example of that.\n\n46\n00:02:32.595 --> 00:02:36.790\nHIPAA makes it sounds like when\nyou talk to people on that one.\n\n47\n00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.090\nAcross the board,\n\n48\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.720\nit applies 100% to everybody that deals\nwith patients in any way, shape, or form.\n\n49\n00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.390\nIt's not the case.\n\n50\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.250\nYou may not realize that, but there's\nactually provisions in that law that say\n\n51\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.280\nif you happen to be a doctor that has,\nor a medical practice, rather,\n\n52\n00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.560\nthat has ten people or less as patients,\nthat doesn't apply to you.\n\n53\n00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.500\n>> Really.\n>> Yeah.\n\n54\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.792\nSo-\n>> I learned something new there.\n\n55\n00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:02.760\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's very specific though.\n\n56\n00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.510\nThink about it.\nThey're saying ten patients or less.\n\n57\n00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.290\nI mean how often does that happen,\nyou know.\n\n58\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.160\nBut it does happen, so they're saying\nwell, those people are exempted from this.\n\n59\n00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.710\nIt doesn't mean that they're\ncompletely off the hook.\n\n60\n00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.071\nThey can just start plastering stuff\nover the Facebook page or on Twitter.\n\n61\n00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:19.337\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They can't\n\n62\n00:03:19.337 --> 00:03:22.559\ndo that because there are still\nprivacy laws in place, but\n\n63\n00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.790\nall the infrastructure that goes\nwith HIPAA doesn't apply to them.\n\n64\n00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.300\nThey have other things that\nthey have specifically for\n\n65\n00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.460\nthem that they need to obey.\n\n66\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.020\nIn fact, it goes back to that issue of for\n\n67\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.980\nthem it would be a really good example\nof okay, you don't have HIPAA, but you\n\n68\n00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.900\ndo still have guidelines as it pertains\nto the protection of what we call PII.\n\n69\n00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.383\nSo you cannot have any situation\nwhere you're protected and\n\n70\n00:03:49.383 --> 00:03:52.326\nhave what they also sometimes\ncall a PII incident.\n\n71\n00:03:52.326 --> 00:03:56.000\nThey do make that distinction, which is\nsomething that we haven't had to make yet,\n\n72\n00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.551\nbut we'll go ahead and make it now,\n\n73\n00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:59.850\nis that there's such a thing\ncalled a PII incident.\n\n74\n00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.560\nWhen you've got that,\nthat's kind of a red flag stage.\n\n75\n00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.400\nYou've had an incident,\nyou have a PII incident, that's different.\n\n76\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.570\nThey're telling you\nspecifically what's happened,\n\n77\n00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.520\nred flag getting hoisted up there, and\n\n78\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.320\npeople better figure out what's going on\npretty quickly and follow procedures.\n\n79\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.370\nYou know so\nthat's something that you'll see.\n\n80\n00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.172\nBut there's a standard for that sort of\nstuff to determine, if it's PII or not.\n\n81\n00:04:22.172 --> 00:04:25.180\nThere's a standard term of HIPAA\nis going to apply to you or\n\n82\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.120\nif you're just going to have standard PII.\n\n83\n00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.690\nPII and privacy practices to adhere to.\n\n84\n00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.430\nSo, you need to make sure.\n\n85\n00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.420\nAs far as making sure,\nthis falls squarely under\n\n86\n00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.110\nthe guidelines, or the concepts of,\ndue care and due diligence.\n\n87\n00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.010\nWe've been through that.\n\n88\n00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.870\nBeen down that road.\n\n89\n00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.520\nWe know what's going on so\nyou have to remember that\n\n90\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.370\nthis is also something else that fits\nin there is due care and due diligence.\n\n91\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.320\nYou have to have those\ncovered at all times.\n\n92\n00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.720\nThe moment you don't is the moment\nyou start opening yourself\n\n93\n00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.000\nup to potential liability issues,\nand no one wants that,\n\n94\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.160\nbecause those liability\nissues can be minor or\n\n95\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.460\nthey can be gargantuan in size, you know\nif someone really wants to go after you.\n\n96\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.230\n>> And let's see, due diligence,\nI'm trying to remember now, Sean.\n\n97\n00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.570\nDue care was what a normal,\n\n98\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.990\nI wanna say a normal person, how did\nyou word that for us with due care?\n\n99\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.540\n>> Due care, the way, the simple way I\nworded it is it's doing what's reasonable.\n\n100\n00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.670\nSo when you exercise due care it's\nsaying that in any given situation,\n\n101\n00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.900\nyou would do what a reasonable\nperson would have done, and\n\n102\n00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.765\nthat applies not just to what we're\ndoing but anything, you know.\n\n103\n00:05:43.015 --> 00:05:48.385\nIt's like saying, a reasonable person,\nif you order a hot cup of coffee\n\n104\n00:05:48.385 --> 00:05:53.000\ndo you expect it to be luke warm or\nto be hot, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.930\nSome people have a problem with that,\nit's like a reasonable person who\n\n106\n00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.970\nis going to look at it and go yeah,\nI ordered a hot cup of coffee.\n\n107\n00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.920\nOkay so I got a hot cup of coffee and\nits like why is this thing hot?\n\n108\n00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.480\nWell, you're stupid because you\nordered a hot cup of coffee.\n\n109\n00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.380\nYou know, that's the thing.\n\n110\n00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.140\nIt's a reasonable situation.\n\n111\n00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.470\nIs it reasonable for you to exercise?\n\n112\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.420\nOr reasonable for you when you\ncross the road to look both ways,\n\n113\n00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.130\nyeah, that's expected that you would do\nthat, to make sure that nothing's coming.\n\n114\n00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.550\nYou just barge out there,\nand you're an idiot.\n\n115\n00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.150\nIt's called Darwinism.\n\n116\n00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.280\n>> Unless you're on\nthe University of Florida campus.\n\n117\n00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.310\nIf you're on the UF campus\nyou better stop for\n\n118\n00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.075\nthe less than reasonable people has well.\n\n119\n00:06:33.075 --> 00:06:38.080\n[LAUGH] So we got the due care and then\nthe due diligence has to do with making\n\n120\n00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.760\nsure that we're doing everything that we\ncan and investigating all the options.\n\n121\n00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.950\n>> Hey, that is what you're doing But\n\n122\n00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.030\nup to that point you'd still\nbe describing due care,\n\n123\n00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.910\nbut you just gotta add one more thing\ninto it, it's on an ongoing basis.\n\n124\n00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:00.873\nSo you exercise due care but\nare you still exercising due care?\n\n125\n00:07:00.873 --> 00:07:03.130\nAre you still checking and\ndoing your audits?\n\n126\n00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.100\nThat's due diligence because you\nare checking these things out.\n\n127\n00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.160\nOver and\nover again on some schedule to make sure\n\n128\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.510\nthat doesn't show that there's a pattern\nof you just doing it once, or is there\n\n129\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.610\na pattern of you exercising\nreasonable constraint or\n\n130\n00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.920\nrestraint or reasonable you know\nmeasures to protect yourself.\n\n131\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.840\n>> And I know we've talk about it in\na couple other episodes like auditing\n\n132\n00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.430\nfor example.\n\n133\n00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.966\nSo if I go into a court room scenario and\n\n134\n00:07:31.966 --> 00:07:36.815\nI show them these audit logs that\nmaybe have evidence against somebody.\n\n135\n00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:39.926\nNot only do I have to show them that I\nhave to show them that I have audited in\n\n136\n00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:43.088\nthe past and there's a pattern of\nauditing and this wasn't something and\n\n137\n00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.467\nthat would be my due diligence.\n\n138\n00:07:44.467 --> 00:07:48.692\n>> Yeah the moment you can't do that\nis the moment you've got a problem.\n\n139\n00:07:48.692 --> 00:07:53.243\nIt's one thing to show that you\nexercise due care to start right off.\n\n140\n00:07:53.243 --> 00:07:55.495\nAnd that's fine that you've done that.\n\n141\n00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:58.077\nBut if it's a year down the road,\ntwo years down the road,\n\n142\n00:07:58.077 --> 00:08:01.840\nand that's the only thing you can show,\nand you haven't done anything since then.\n\n143\n00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.340\nThey're gonna say, hey, you started off\nthe right way, what the heck happened?\n\n144\n00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.530\nYou didn't do anything since then,\n\n145\n00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.980\nyou didn't check it, you didn't change\nanything, you didn't do any research.\n\n146\n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.580\nWhy were you asleep at the wheel?\n\n147\n00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.420\nYou better have a pretty good excuse\nat that point, especially if something\n\n148\n00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.150\nbad has happened, and you're answering\nthat question in front of a jury.\n\n149\n00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.380\nThat's gonna turn out pretty bad for you.\n\n150\n00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:30.168\nBe like, [SOUND], you better be in a coma,\nalong with everyone else in the business.\n\n151\n00:08:30.168 --> 00:08:34.670\nSo, that's where those\nthings fit together.\n\n152\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:38.440\n>> All right now, you've got down here\npresidential decision directives.\n\n153\n00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.890\n>> Yes, that's something, and\nyou've got to remember by the way,\n\n154\n00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:47.230\nis when we're talking about this, and\nthese presidential decision directives\n\n155\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:53.010\nare one thing that you might look at as\nit relates to due care and due diligence.\n\n156\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.130\nYou have to remember that some of\nthe stuff we're gonna quote here,\n\n157\n00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.375\nreally any of the stuff\nwe're gonna quote here,\n\n158\n00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:00.690\nreally doesn't necessarily\napply to all of you.\n\n159\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.318\nIn fact some of you might look at that and\ngo,\n\n160\n00:09:02.318 --> 00:09:04.310\n[LAUGH] yeah whatever\nI'm not looking at it.\n\n161\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.970\nI mean we've got,\nthose of you that aren't even in the US.\n\n162\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.180\nSo president decision directive,\nain't gonna apply to you period.\n\n163\n00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.730\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n164\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.544\nBut you may have something equivalent, but\n\n165\n00:09:15.544 --> 00:09:19.885\nthat doesn't apply to you the way it\nwould apply to us here in the US.\n\n166\n00:09:19.885 --> 00:09:22.695\nSo you've got that.\n\n167\n00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:26.442\nYou have to keep in mind that every\nbusiness, every industry, wherever you\n\n168\n00:09:26.442 --> 00:09:30.421\nare, there is a different mixture of\nthings that come into play, and we haven't\n\n169\n00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:34.830\neven gotten to the point where we start\nextending stuff over national boundaries.\n\n170\n00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.949\nAnd this is one of the tricky things by\nthe way, with being a CASp, is when you're\n\n171\n00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:42.660\na CASp, like we said, your kind of like\n[SOUND] right there in the middle.\n\n172\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.260\nBetween all these people at the bottom,\nthe rank and file, and the supervisors,\n\n173\n00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.267\nstuff like that.\n\n174\n00:09:48.267 --> 00:09:50.955\nAnd the CEO level and\nthe executives up here.\n\n175\n00:09:50.955 --> 00:09:52.425\nSo you're occupying that space,\n\n176\n00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:56.805\nso you're acting kinda sorta\nas a liaison between the two.\n\n177\n00:09:56.805 --> 00:10:00.260\nAnd you're gonna have to,\nkinda have your ear to the ground.\n\n178\n00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.567\nHearing the different types of things\nthat are happening and changing, and\n\n179\n00:10:03.567 --> 00:10:06.667\nexercising due diligence, say hey,\nthere's some new standards, or\n\n180\n00:10:06.667 --> 00:10:08.630\nsomething new that's been published in.\n\n181\n00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.170\nI look at it, this does apply to us, so\n\n182\n00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.830\nyou gotta work with someone at that\nlevel which could be assist for example.\n\n183\n00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.010\nWork with someone to make sure\nthey have the correct information,\n\n184\n00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.880\nor they may be pushing it down on you,\nsaying okay, well this new thing came out.\n\n185\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.870\nWe interpreted it so, make sure this\ngets implemented the right way,\n\n186\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.430\ncuz they may be doing, that person\nyou're talking to may actually be\n\n187\n00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.310\nthe CSO that also is acting\nas a program manager.\n\n188\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.960\nRemember what we said about programs, they\ninterpret the policy from the people way\n\n189\n00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.030\nup top, they interpret it to actual\ninformation with milestones and\n\n190\n00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.870\nthen it goes further down for\nsomeone to actually do the step by step.\n\n191\n00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.000\nSo, keep that in mind\nwhen you're doing this.\n\n192\n00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.270\nSo, where does a presidential\ndecision directive fit in?\n\n193\n00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.430\nA presidential decision\ndirective is kind of like,\n\n194\n00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.090\nthey call it a form of executive order.\n\n195\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.459\nIt kind of fits in the same category.\n\n196\n00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:03.338\nThey could just, decide if the president\nhere, can put something together,\n\n197\n00:11:03.338 --> 00:11:06.293\nhave it checked, and\nsign it into law and that's kinda it.\n\n198\n00:11:06.293 --> 00:11:09.710\nIt's kinda like taking\nthe shortcut around Congress, and\n\n199\n00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.806\nI'm kind of simplifying stuff here,\nbut that's kind of the way it is,\n\n200\n00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:17.793\nand I don't want to teach a government\nclass, I really don't, so.\n\n201\n00:11:17.793 --> 00:11:19.182\n>> Thank goodness.\n\n202\n00:11:19.182 --> 00:11:21.640\nI didn't do so well in that.\n\n203\n00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.077\n>> If you want, though,\nMike can put a link to that,\n\n204\n00:11:24.077 --> 00:11:26.707\nI'm only a bill stuff from\nSchoolhouse Rock for you.\n\n205\n00:11:26.707 --> 00:11:32.262\n>> [LAUGH] Wouldn't that be great now\nI hear singing that in my head for\n\n206\n00:11:32.262 --> 00:11:34.492\nthe rest of this episode.\n\n207\n00:11:34.492 --> 00:11:36.713\nThat might give you,\nthere might be times when,\n\n208\n00:11:36.713 --> 00:11:39.802\nI don't know, are these directives\nused when we don't have time to\n\n209\n00:11:39.802 --> 00:11:43.214\ngo through the normal channels, and\nsomething's gotta be done now, or,\n\n210\n00:11:43.214 --> 00:11:47.130\nmaybe there wasn't anything before and\nneeded to get something in place?\n\n211\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.340\n>> It could be for those.\n\n212\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.200\nThe president could put something like\nthat in place, because they really don't\n\n213\n00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:58.450\nhave time to wait for that, or it's\nvery specific, they are fairly limited.\n\n214\n00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.860\nIt's pretty powerful,\nit is limited on its scope.\n\n215\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.250\nThey can issue them for specific things.\n\n216\n00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.650\nAnd they can also be at the president,\n\n217\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.560\nwhile they can issue them,\ncan have them overturned.\n\n218\n00:12:10.305 --> 00:12:13.945\nIf that comes into play, but it's\nsomething that they can use if they need\n\n219\n00:12:13.945 --> 00:12:17.835\nto implement something really specific,\n\n220\n00:12:17.835 --> 00:12:22.725\nimmediately, without having to put up\nwith all the going through Congress,\n\n221\n00:12:22.725 --> 00:12:25.205\nand have that big delay and\neverything in there.\n\n222\n00:12:25.205 --> 00:12:30.788\nBut they can't be as broad as the ones\nthat Congress puts through from,\n\n223\n00:12:30.788 --> 00:12:35.300\nthat's what my understanding\nwith those ones are.\n\n224\n00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.290\nThere's a bunch of them out there,\nthere's a website if you Google it,\n\n225\n00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.390\nthere's actually a website for\n\n226\n00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.560\npresidential decision directives if\nyou're really interested in that.\n\n227\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.120\nYou can find them.\n\n228\n00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.844\nYou're probably gonna find a lot\nof good stuff to put you to sleep,\n\n229\n00:12:48.844 --> 00:12:51.582\nplus a few nuggets of things\nthat do apply to you.\n\n230\n00:12:51.582 --> 00:12:55.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah so they'll find that so\n\n231\n00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.530\nbe prepared for that if you go look at it.\n\n232\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.677\nLook at it after we're done taping,\n\n233\n00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:01.461\nbecause I don't want you\nguys falling asleep.\n\n234\n00:13:01.461 --> 00:13:02.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n235\n00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.937\nfall asleep I'll shave your eyebrows,\nI'm just telling you.\n\n236\n00:13:04.937 --> 00:13:06.733\nI'll find where you are and\nshave your eyebrows.\n\n237\n00:13:06.733 --> 00:13:11.903\n[LAUGH]\n>> So we've really gotta pay attention,\n\n238\n00:13:11.903 --> 00:13:15.864\nif they have to do with something that's\nin our industry or something like that.\n\n239\n00:13:15.864 --> 00:13:20.602\nAnd then we've got,\nI guess what's the term I'm looking for,\n\n240\n00:13:20.602 --> 00:13:24.336\nliability issues,\nthat we've got to deal with.\n\n241\n00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:27.192\n>> Yeah, liability would\ndefinitely be a big part of this,\n\n242\n00:13:28.392 --> 00:13:31.902\nno matter what you're being impacted by,\nif you don't follow it.\n\n243\n00:13:31.902 --> 00:13:34.022\nThat could be a problem,\nif you don't follow it the right way,\n\n244\n00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:35.372\nthat could be a problem.\n\n245\n00:13:35.372 --> 00:13:37.212\nOr they could just limit your liability.\n\n246\n00:13:37.212 --> 00:13:40.130\nIt doesn't mean you're completely off\nthe hook but they limit your liability.\n\n247\n00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.710\nBut the thing is is that hopefully if\nyou follow the appropriate guidelines,\n\n248\n00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.091\nappropriate standards,\nthat will cut that down.\n\n249\n00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:51.469\nOne of the ones that's mentioned a lot\nis stuff like NIST, National Institute\n\n250\n00:13:51.469 --> 00:13:57.720\nof Standards and Technology, they've got\na bunch of stuff that applies to us.\n\n251\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.620\nNot all of it applies to you, but it can\napply in different combinations to you,\n\n252\n00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.590\nso that's one for the federal government,\nhere, they have another one called\n\n253\n00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:10.060\nFIPS which deals with certain\ntechnologies and stuff like that.\n\n254\n00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.547\nThere's FISMA and a bunch of other ones.\n\n255\n00:14:12.547 --> 00:14:14.680\nThere's PCIDSS if you've got that.\n\n256\n00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.930\nThat's another thing.\n\n257\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.690\nAll those things are if you follow them,\n\n258\n00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:23.100\nthose do ensure a certain\nstandard of behavior.\n\n259\n00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.230\nOr supposed to ensure a certain\nstandard of behavior.\n\n260\n00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:32.210\nBut they also have the benefit of,\nif you're following the whims,\n\n261\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.850\nby the way they're meant to be followed,\nit also limits your liability too.\n\n262\n00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.070\nWhich is a good thing.\n\n263\n00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:41.230\nYou may not ever be able to get completely\nout of the realm of being liable for\n\n264\n00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:48.730\nsome action, but you can definitely,\nyou can't eliminate it,\n\n265\n00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:53.020\nbut limit it to a certain degree,\nso you're not as on the hook.\n\n266\n00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.022\nSo you fall-\n>> I think we talked about that with our\n\n267\n00:14:56.022 --> 00:14:58.890\ndue diligence and\nour due care in an earlier episode.\n\n268\n00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.947\nWhere, that might not release\nme of all liability, but\n\n269\n00:15:01.947 --> 00:15:05.865\nI could definitely show that I was\ntrying and that could be beneficial.\n\n270\n00:15:05.865 --> 00:15:07.550\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n271\n00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.950\nIf you can show you're putting\nsome effort into it, and\n\n272\n00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:16.355\nyou're doing what, again to use that term,\nwhat's reasonable and you can actually do.\n\n273\n00:15:16.355 --> 00:15:19.865\nYou shouldn't just stop and say hey,\nI'm gonna do what's reasonable.\n\n274\n00:15:19.865 --> 00:15:24.450\nThat's, if you're satisfied with being\nmediocre than who am I to stop you.\n\n275\n00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.442\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Mikhal lists some good ones too,\n\n276\n00:15:26.442 --> 00:15:27.585\nCoBit and stuff like that.\n\n277\n00:15:27.585 --> 00:15:29.265\nThose are other good ones in there.\n\n278\n00:15:29.265 --> 00:15:31.605\nBut yeah,\nif you want to meet the standard and\n\n279\n00:15:31.605 --> 00:15:36.695\nbe mediocre hey, whatever,\nI mean [LAUGH] free will man.\n\n280\n00:15:36.695 --> 00:15:38.495\nYou're welcome to do that.\n\n281\n00:15:38.495 --> 00:15:41.157\nBut you shouldn't just shoot for that.\n\n282\n00:15:41.157 --> 00:15:42.484\nYou shouldn't just shoot-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:44.109\n>> For the middle.\n\n284\n00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:45.967\nYou should look to exceed that.\n\n285\n00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:49.730\nBecause they could also ask you just\nbecause you me the standard, yeah,\n\n286\n00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.330\nyou met the standard, but\nwhy did you stop there?\n\n287\n00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.360\nYou definitely had,\nyou know, the ability and\n\n288\n00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.630\nit was not unreasonable thinking\nyou might try to do more than that.\n\n289\n00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.390\nWhy?\n\n290\n00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:04.610\nThat could still be enough for\nthem to go through and drop the ax on you.\n\n291\n00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:09.379\nBelieve it or not,\nthey can do that under some situations.\n\n292\n00:16:09.379 --> 00:16:12.805\nI've seen it in numerous [LAUGH]\nindustries, numerous disciplines,\n\n293\n00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:16.867\nthat they put a standard out there and you\ncan check everything off the list and say,\n\n294\n00:16:16.867 --> 00:16:18.105\noh, well that's nice.\n\n295\n00:16:18.105 --> 00:16:19.385\nWe're gonna find you.\n\n296\n00:16:19.385 --> 00:16:20.625\n[LAUGH] And it's like what?\n\n297\n00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:21.695\nI did what you told me.\n\n298\n00:16:21.695 --> 00:16:24.275\nIt's like yeah, but\nwe just felt like being sadistic.\n\n299\n00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:26.295\nI don't know, they'll do stuff like that.\n\n300\n00:16:27.435 --> 00:16:30.725\nI think for pilots in the U.S.\n\n301\n00:16:30.725 --> 00:16:34.660\nthey have something called the was\nit articles of incorporation?\n\n302\n00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.660\nAnd basically the FAA tells you,\nhere's all the stuff you\n\n303\n00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:42.540\nneed to know about whatever,\ncautioning exercise and stuff like that.\n\n304\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.340\nSo they have this big rule book of stuff.\n\n305\n00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.396\nBut they also have these things that\nare the standard called the articles of\n\n306\n00:16:47.396 --> 00:16:49.483\nincorporation where they\ncan basically say yeah,\n\n307\n00:16:49.483 --> 00:16:52.585\nyou need to know all the stuff about\nthe flight and all these safety things and\n\n308\n00:16:52.585 --> 00:16:55.399\nall this performance stuff,\nyou need to have all that stuff handy and\n\n309\n00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:58.350\nknow about it, and blah, blah blah and\nhave shown that you planned it.\n\n310\n00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.817\nBut even if you did plan all that stuff,\nif we see that you did something that you\n\n311\n00:17:02.817 --> 00:17:05.943\nalso should have known about,\nwe'll get you on that.\n\n312\n00:17:05.943 --> 00:17:09.580\n[LAUGH] They just fine us,\nif that's the case,\n\n313\n00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.605\nthey'll say hey,\nyou should have known about it.\n\n314\n00:17:13.605 --> 00:17:15.325\nThey only require you to know some basics.\n\n315\n00:17:15.325 --> 00:17:18.925\nI mean stuff like weather and\nhow long to get to an airport and\n\n316\n00:17:18.925 --> 00:17:22.580\nextra fuel to get to another airport past\njust in case it's closure is a problem.\n\n317\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.980\nSo, you know you're route and\nall that stuff.\n\n318\n00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.420\nYou know, let's say you know your route\nand the weather, everything looks good.\n\n319\n00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:32.700\nAnd somehow you miss something,\nyou know, along the way.\n\n320\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:37.330\nAnd it's not critical, but it causes some\ndeviation or something from your plan and\n\n321\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.230\nthey catch on it.\n\n322\n00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:44.150\nThey'll say well, why didn't you\nhave an extra set of glasses on you?\n\n323\n00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:48.250\nOr what happened, why didn't you\nhave an extra chart or whatever,\n\n324\n00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.380\nextra batteries for a flashlight?\n\n325\n00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.230\nWell, I just put fresh ones in there,\nmust have been a defective.\n\n326\n00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.560\nWe should have prepared for that,\nthere's a 1,000 bucks, bang.\n\n327\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.583\nYou know, see you later.\n\n328\n00:17:56.583 --> 00:17:58.976\n[LAUGH] Won't do that to you.\n\n329\n00:17:58.976 --> 00:18:01.825\n>> [LAUGH] That reasonable term kind\nof gives them some flexibility in there\n\n330\n00:18:01.825 --> 00:18:02.400\ndoesn't it?\n\n331\n00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.920\n>> Yeah,\nthey could do those sort of things so\n\n332\n00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.060\nyou can see it can become\nkind of tricky now.\n\n333\n00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.520\nI don't wanna give anyone the impression\nthat there's any agency or\n\n334\n00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.250\ngovernment out there, sitting there,\n\n335\n00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:18.305\nwaiting there behind the bushes with\na knife, going, come on, doing that.\n\n336\n00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:22.160\n[LAUGH] I don't want anyone to\nthink that's what's happening, but\n\n337\n00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.370\nit's just to show you that doing\nmore than what's reasonable.\n\n338\n00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.490\nI'm not saying go crazy with it.\n\n339\n00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:33.240\nI'm saying doing more than\nwhat's the bare minimum is\n\n340\n00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.635\nshows that you're not only willing\nto meet the standard as a cast,\n\n341\n00:18:37.635 --> 00:18:41.425\nyou should be willing\nto meet the standard.\n\n342\n00:18:41.425 --> 00:18:46.335\nAnd then go above that to show that,\nhey, I put some extra stuff in.\n\n343\n00:18:46.335 --> 00:18:50.765\nBecause, think about this, how could\nI get you, if you met the standard?\n\n344\n00:18:50.765 --> 00:18:51.755\nLet me put it in those terms.\n\n345\n00:18:51.755 --> 00:18:52.555\nIf you met the standard,\n\n346\n00:18:52.555 --> 00:18:56.525\nhow could I actually nail you on it if\nI'm someone looking to get you on that?\n\n347\n00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.500\nI'm going to get you?\n\n348\n00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.630\nWell you met the standard and something\ngot compromised and you don't have any\n\n349\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.990\nwiggle room and it goes right through\nthe floor and now you get nailed.\n\n350\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.900\nI'm going to ask you,\n\n351\n00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.970\nyou don't think it's reasonable to have\na little bit of a buffer on there?\n\n352\n00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.780\nSo if something fails you know you don't\ncompletely drop through the floor and\n\n353\n00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.300\nall of a sudden you've got a problem.\n\n354\n00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.880\nThat's stupid to not have\nsome buffer on there.\n\n355\n00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.340\nWe gotcha.\n\n356\n00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.647\nThat's something that\nyou need to think about.\n\n357\n00:19:24.647 --> 00:19:27.915\nMikela puts it nicely,\ncompliant security versus actual security.\n\n358\n00:19:27.915 --> 00:19:30.070\n[LAUGH] You know,\nthere's being compliant and\n\n359\n00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:34.410\nthere's actually having something\nthat's true to life and actually works.\n\n360\n00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.060\nDon't forget those.\n\n361\n00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.880\nSo do not shoot for the middle.\n\n362\n00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.415\nDo not shoot for minimum standard.\n\n363\n00:19:39.415 --> 00:19:41.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not gonna help you.\n\n364\n00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.440\nYou have to be, you have to remember,\ndo what's reasonable.\n\n365\n00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.520\nIt's not reasonable to be there,\nstanding on the ledge just waiting for\n\n366\n00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.700\na strong breeze to push you over.\n\n367\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.260\n>> And can we turn around and\ncombine some of these things,\n\n368\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.790\nlike should I, do I need to do\ndue diligence with my standards?\n\n369\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:01.030\nIn other words, standards are fixed,\nbut they can change, right?\n\n370\n00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:06.010\nNew standards can be applied,\nstandards can be modified?\n\n371\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:10.640\n>> That's exactly why you have\nthat marriage between due care and\n\n372\n00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.360\ndue diligence.\n\n373\n00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.200\nWhat applied before doesn't necessarily\napply now, so you can't just say I'm going\n\n374\n00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.350\nto keep applying that same guidance\nbecause that's out of date.\n\n375\n00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:25.680\nAnd they will look for that if you\never come into a situation where\n\n376\n00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.270\nthe lawyers are getting\ninvolved with that.\n\n377\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.260\nWhat's gonna happen is is that they're\ngonna look at that and say well, yeah,\n\n378\n00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:36.130\nyou showed some level of due care and\n\n379\n00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:41.010\nyou showed some level of due\ndiligence by keep applying that.\n\n380\n00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.130\nBut, what the heck.\n\n381\n00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:45.042\nThe due diligence was just,\nhey like a robot.\n\n382\n00:20:45.042 --> 00:20:47.740\nGo apply the same thing over and\nover and over again.\n\n383\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.390\nWell, those standards are about\nfive years, ten years out of date.\n\n384\n00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:52.360\nThere's new ones.\n\n385\n00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.300\nHow come you didn't know about it?\n\n386\n00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.370\nYou can't get away with that.\n\n387\n00:20:55.370 --> 00:21:00.086\nIt's like saying, if you're a doctor\nin the mid '80s, when before\n\n388\n00:21:00.086 --> 00:21:05.400\nHIPA came in was even a twinkle in\nanyone's eye really at that point.\n\n389\n00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.850\nIf you're still applying the same\nstandards to that point that you're still\n\n390\n00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:12.240\npracticing today and you're still applying\nthose same standards from back in\n\n391\n00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.260\nlike '85 or something,\nyou will not be a doctor for much longer.\n\n392\n00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.526\nBecause they're going to nail\nyou to the wall on that,\n\n393\n00:21:19.526 --> 00:21:22.447\nit's like you don't know about HIPA,\nreally?\n\n394\n00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:25.900\n[LAUGH] You've never been to any\nconferences, you've never kept up to date.\n\n395\n00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.880\nYou didn't get any mailings.\n\n396\n00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.760\nYou know lawyers come in here, you know,\nwhen you went to do stuff on your medical\n\n397\n00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.080\nlicense and all,\nthey didn't give you any information.\n\n398\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.203\nYou can't sit there going no,\nno you're lying.\n\n399\n00:21:36.203 --> 00:21:37.200\nThey're going to know you're lying.\n\n400\n00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.930\nThere's no way you can avoid\nthat if you're in the industry.\n\n401\n00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.620\nYou wouldn't be working in it.\n\n402\n00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.950\nThere's no possible way.\n\n403\n00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.200\nI mean you take insurance from somebody.\n\n404\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.440\nIt's got HIPPA stuff right on there,\nyou know.\n\n405\n00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.980\nSo no matter whose insurance you're\ntaking, it's got it right there,\n\n406\n00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.680\nthose providers know about it so\nyou had to encounter it.\n\n407\n00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.530\nSo you're not doing what's reasonable and\n\n408\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.730\nin fact you're even stuffing\nyour head in the sand.\n\n409\n00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.790\nYou're going I don't know what's going on.\n\n410\n00:21:58.790 --> 00:21:59.710\nThey're gonna get you.\n\n411\n00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.463\nIt just doesn't work.\n\n412\n00:22:00.463 --> 00:22:04.650\n>> So it sounds like we talked about with\nour security research and friends and\n\n413\n00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:05.250\nthings like that.\n\n414\n00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.478\nThe same kind of things apply here.\n\n415\n00:22:07.478 --> 00:22:10.558\nWe've got it's changes and\nwe've got to stay on top of it.\n\n416\n00:22:10.558 --> 00:22:17.060\nThey're not gonna cut us slack if we\njust say, well, I didn't see the change.\n\n417\n00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.920\n>> Yeah, ignorance isn't gonna get you\noff the hook, let's put it that way.\n\n418\n00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:26.780\nSo you have to stay current,\nyou have to stay in the game.\n\n419\n00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.620\nAnd you have to keep re-applying and\ndoing the stuff where necessary.\n\n420\n00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.490\nIf not, you're gonna come to a bad end.\n\n421\n00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.360\nThey're not going to cut\nyou that much slack.\n\n422\n00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:43.305\n>> And as a cast we don't really have to,\nI think you said at the beginning just to\n\n423\n00:22:43.305 --> 00:22:47.060\nmake sure, we don't have to be\nfamiliar with the actual laws.\n\n424\n00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.920\nLike we talked about legal liabilities,\n\n425\n00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.840\nit's more about just being\naware of what that means.\n\n426\n00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.400\nYeah, that's how I would characterize it.\n\n427\n00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.900\nI wouldn't expect you, as a CASP,\n\n428\n00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.390\nto ever be versed on every\nlittle nuance of the law.\n\n429\n00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:02.950\nIf you're not coming into it,\n\n430\n00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.360\nthen you're sure as heck ain't\ngonna be coming out of it.\n\n431\n00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.495\nUnless you're gonna start\nattending law school or something,\n\n432\n00:23:09.495 --> 00:23:11.885\nyou're probably not ever\ngonna be versed on it.\n\n433\n00:23:11.885 --> 00:23:13.770\nSome people do.\n\n434\n00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:18.090\nI know people that know HIPAA\nbackwards and forwards.\n\n435\n00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.360\nThey're not lawyers or anything.\n\n436\n00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.833\nThey just work with it all the time.\n\n437\n00:23:21.833 --> 00:23:26.662\nSo you'll acquire that but I wouldn't tell\nthe same people, I wouldn't tell them oh,\n\n438\n00:23:26.662 --> 00:23:28.240\nyou're an expert on HIPAA.\n\n439\n00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.950\nI wouldn't expect them to know the other\nside of HIPAA because they haven't know\n\n440\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:34.670\nthat because they work directly with it.\n\n441\n00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.370\nWhat about the other stuff\nthat comes into play?\n\n442\n00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:41.320\nWhat if there's doctors office\nthat like most doctors offices\n\n443\n00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.410\nthey take your credit card or\npayment in there.\n\n444\n00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:48.470\nIf they're taking credit cards that's\npayment card industry territory.\n\n445\n00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.430\nSo now all of a sudden, do you know that\ntech not, do you know what they're doing?\n\n446\n00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:58.040\nWell I know there's an organization,\ndo you know how that applies to you?\n\n447\n00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.600\nIf you don't, and\njust make some rough guesses,\n\n448\n00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.020\nyou're going to be in\ntrouble pretty quickly.\n\n449\n00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.530\n>> All right, well Shawn I tell you,\na lot of great information there on\n\n450\n00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:11.360\nbest practices when it comes to standards,\nand due care and due diligence.\n\n451\n00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.790\nAnd some of those legal liability\nthings that we have to worry about.\n\n452\n00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.070\nSo, anything else we want to put in\nthis episode before we call it a day?\n\n453\n00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.845\n>> No, I think we have enough\nlegal stuff for today.\n\n454\n00:24:19.845 --> 00:24:22.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know if they're asleep or\n\n455\n00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.650\nnot yet, but [LAUGH]\n>> The last thing over out there.\n\n456\n00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:26.950\nAll right, well.\n\n457\n00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:30.010\nLadies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n458\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.090\nFor now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n459\n00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.130\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n460\n00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.775\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n461\n00:24:35.775 --> 00:24:40.620\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.240\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick we\nare here today with Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.100\nHow are you doing Mr. Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.490\n>> Doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.120\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.110\nWe've got another one of our CompTIA\nadvanced security practitioner episodes\n\n8\n00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.790\ncoming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.170\nAnd in this one we're gonna be talking\nabout adapting to new technologies.\n\n10\n00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.750\nWe've talked about how in security it's\nimportant to stay on top of the latest\n\n11\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.470\ntrends and what's going on and new\ntechnology is right there with it right.\n\n12\n00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.210\nIt's something else we've\ngot to stay on top off.\n\n13\n00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.420\n>> Yeah this is one of the trickiest areas\nthat you're going to have because it's\n\n14\n00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.270\nnot a problem that goes away is bringing\nin new technologies to the workplace.\n\n15\n00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.710\nSo be prepared to have to deal with this.\n\n16\n00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.250\nIf you're not already dealing with it and\nall the problems and\n\n17\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.580\nissues and everything that goes with it.\n\n18\n00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.000\nLike I said it's going\nto be ongoing problem.\n\n19\n00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.633\nIt's not gonna go away, it's gonna be\nextremely challenging frustrating,\n\n20\n00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:08.415\nyou name it.\n\n21\n00:01:08.415 --> 00:01:11.740\nYou could even use four letter words\nto name the problem if you want.\n\n22\n00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.055\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because sometimes you feel like that.\n\n23\n00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:14.690\n>> Yeah, we do.\n\n24\n00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.265\n[LAUGH] And just to answer that, I think,\n\n25\n00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:18.975\nI'd much rather think Guido\nwas kidding with us there.\n\n26\n00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:21.625\nBut, in the chat room define new,\n\n27\n00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:23.715\nanything that you haven't had\nin your network before, right?\n\n28\n00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:26.215\nIf all of a sudden people\nstart bringing in iPhones,\n\n29\n00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:29.600\nwell that's new technology to your\nnetwork that you now have to deal with.\n\n30\n00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.950\nHave to incorporate into security\npolicies and all of that.\n\n31\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.972\n>> Yeah, that's a pretty fair question\nwhen you talk about what new is.\n\n32\n00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:43.140\nI mean your definition, Mike,\nwould work just fine to say,\n\n33\n00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.920\nwell, we have new technology.\n\n34\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.170\nWell, new technology and\nnew to your environment.\n\n35\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.860\nYou can also look at it as,\nwell, new technology.\n\n36\n00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.630\nWhen you have new technology is\nthat going to be a case of you've\n\n37\n00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.490\ngot something that is just brand new to\nyour network or is it new to the industry?\n\n38\n00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.480\nBoth of those will present\ninteresting challenges,\n\n39\n00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.390\nbecause if you bring an iPhone in iPhones,\nit's kind of like a known quantity.\n\n40\n00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.420\nIf someone brought an iPhone,\nlet's say they bought an iPhone 4.\n\n41\n00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.110\nThat's not brand new,\nit's a known quantity.\n\n42\n00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.140\nWe can find it from Asia and\non, so why it's new to us.\n\n43\n00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.400\nFortunately, we still have enough\ngroundwork has been done by other people.\n\n44\n00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.920\nWe may even own one ourselves,\nso we know what the issues are,\n\n45\n00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.380\nat least a good portion of them.\n\n46\n00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.400\nWhereas if it's a brand new device\nthat just came on the market, and\n\n47\n00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.620\npeople really do not have the experience\nwith it then, that changes it a lot.\n\n48\n00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.060\nBecause now you're gonna have\nto roll up your sleeves and\n\n49\n00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.880\nreally do a lot of work on it.\n\n50\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.540\nSo if they came out with an iPhone\n7 all of a sudden next week.\n\n51\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.030\nAnd some of the people start bringing\nthose things in as the early adopters.\n\n52\n00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.310\n>> We've got the Apple watch whatever\nthey want to call that one now.\n\n53\n00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.250\nThat's something we're starting\nto see in our network here never\n\n54\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.560\nhad to deal with it before.\n\n55\n00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.790\n>> Yeah, exactly it's an unknown quantity.\n\n56\n00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.490\nAnd one of the things that's\nkind of interesting about\n\n57\n00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.010\nsecurity people is I should say it's\ninteresting about security people.\n\n58\n00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.100\nAnd those people their\nown little quirks in\n\n59\n00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.880\nthe industry about\nadapting new technology.\n\n60\n00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.170\nYou get security personnel\n\n61\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.130\nthat will want to look at the new\ntechnology know how it works.\n\n62\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.010\nBut they maybe when you look at\nthem you look at them as being\n\n63\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.300\non at date on their own technology,\nbecause they don't want the new stuff.\n\n64\n00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.560\nI can be in my own personal\nprofessional stuff because\n\n65\n00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.490\nof what I know I don't\nwant to adopt a new stuff.\n\n66\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.110\nI am like other people be my beta tester\nwhatever you wanna call let them do that\n\n67\n00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.792\nOn Charlie test supposed, [LAUGH].\n\n68\n00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:46.802\nAlpha Beta Charlie that is\nwhat the consumers do but\n\n69\n00:03:46.802 --> 00:03:49.250\nwe're gonna make it not sound as bad.\n\n70\n00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.330\nI won't adopt the new stuff right away.\n\n71\n00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.200\nI will look at it and get used to it.\n\n72\n00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.430\nKick the tires and see the issues and\nkeep track of them.\n\n73\n00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.690\nBut until I feel like there's been\nenough time past between release and had\n\n74\n00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.120\npeople to kick on it, beat on it, see what\nthe issues are, I'm not gonna adopt it.\n\n75\n00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.840\nI'm not even one of the extreme cases.\n\n76\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.830\nThere are people that will stay\na full release behind in their stuff.\n\n77\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.230\nSo when there's people that when\n\n78\n00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.950\nVista shift they finally\nmoved off of 2000 on XP.\n\n79\n00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.560\nSo they were in this perpetual state of\nbeing a release behind on their stuff.\n\n80\n00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.880\nAnd they were doing it because they knew\nthat release had been out by the time\n\n81\n00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.160\nthe next release comes out that one's\nbeen pounded on and beaten on and\n\n82\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.480\na lot of the issues that\nhave been addressed.\n\n83\n00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.750\nSo that's a kind of a good thing and\n\n84\n00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.130\nsame thing also applies to\nnew patches too by the way.\n\n85\n00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.380\nThat's why we dont' just take patches and\nservice packs and\n\n86\n00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.650\njust throw them out there.\n\n87\n00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.740\nBecause for all intents and purposes for\n\n88\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.670\nwhat we do that changes\nwhat that product is.\n\n89\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.870\nBecause a service pack by its\ndefinition is adding new features and\n\n90\n00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.190\nmaking some pretty significant\nchanges in a lot of cases.\n\n91\n00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.470\nYou're not, the product may have\nbeen stabilized at some point and\n\n92\n00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.360\npeople are used to kinda\nseeing those issues.\n\n93\n00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.506\nNow, you threw a service pack in and\nthat monkeyed with the whole formula.\n\n94\n00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:09.674\nNow you gotta reevaluate the system\nto see if it's okay, and\n\n95\n00:05:09.674 --> 00:05:13.242\nlet it stabilize to make sure problems and\neverything are gone now.\n\n96\n00:05:13.242 --> 00:05:15.702\nAnd who knows, they might release\nanother service pack at that point.\n\n97\n00:05:15.702 --> 00:05:16.869\n>> Right.\n>> So that,\n\n98\n00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:21.675\nI gave you a long essay there on\nwhat new technology can mean, but\n\n99\n00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:25.920\nhopefully that settles down\nthis issue a bit more.\n\n100\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.920\n>> And so, mobile devices are a big thing\nthat we especially nowadays are seeing\n\n101\n00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.710\nnew devices coming into our network.\n\n102\n00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.890\n>> Yeah, mobile devices are a big one.\n\n103\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.420\nIn fact, one of the one's they don't throw\non the cast on top of this, I throw in\n\n104\n00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.460\nthe same type of zip code what they're\ntalking about here for mobile devices.\n\n105\n00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.140\nBecause I think we're pretty\nclear on mobile devices.\n\n106\n00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.912\nLook at these I got two\nlines on my business\n\n107\n00:05:48.912 --> 00:05:50.341\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n108\n00:05:50.341 --> 00:05:53.520\n>> [LAUGH] I mean, yeah it's pretty easy,\n\n109\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.280\nyou got devices like this,\nmobile devices, tablets, stuff like that,\n\n110\n00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.430\nwe know what that is.\n\n111\n00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.720\nBut what happens is you have that,\nbut what else do we have?\n\n112\n00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.600\nWe have that new buzz over\nthe internet of things.\n\n113\n00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.231\nSo we have a lot of stuff that's also\ninternet connected and then you've got\n\n114\n00:06:08.231 --> 00:06:12.089\nstuff, that home automation stuff that,\ntrust me, it's not just being used in\n\n115\n00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:16.030\nthe home even though that's the buzzword\nit's being shown up in businesses too.\n\n116\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.055\nSo you have all those\nthings being thrown in so,\n\n117\n00:06:19.055 --> 00:06:24.201\nit represents a change in the fundamental\nequation of how we deal with security,\n\n118\n00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:26.290\nmobile devices were a big deal.\n\n119\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.460\nMobile devices changed things, just like\nbefore that, laptops changed things,\n\n120\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.950\nwhen people could more easily,\nbuy a notebook and\n\n121\n00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.330\nstart carrying a stuff around and\nbusinesses have been more accessible.\n\n122\n00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.360\nNetbooks were something that just\na few years ago change the equation.\n\n123\n00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.870\nBecause those were cheaper for\n\n124\n00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.880\npeople to get and talking about\nmobile device that's only a couple of\n\n125\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.360\nhundred bucks in some cases that\nsomething you can get and carry around.\n\n126\n00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.990\nBut that was a big, big shift there.\n\n127\n00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.870\nAnd so mobile devices have done that again\nwith all these smart phones getting truly\n\n128\n00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.450\nsmart what they can do.\n\n129\n00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.520\nAnd then having tablets and all this other\nstuff, you have to deal with these things\n\n130\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.030\nbecause these will be appearing in your\nworkplace if they're not all ready there.\n\n131\n00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.620\nAnd they bring a whole bunch of\nsecurity issues that come with it.\n\n132\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.824\nI mean, it just countless,\n\n133\n00:07:14.824 --> 00:07:20.640\nreally countless number of issues\nwhich we do have to talk about that.\n\n134\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.380\nI really think,\nwe do have to talk about those issues.\n\n135\n00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.180\n>> Yeah, I mean because I guess it\ndepends on whether you are in control of\n\n136\n00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.330\nthe device or\nwhether it's the end user's device.\n\n137\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.730\n>> That would be definitely be part of it.\n\n138\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.120\nAnd there's been all\nsorts of strategies for\n\n139\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.210\nthat, there's been businesses\nissued devices in the past,\n\n140\n00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.110\nyou saw businesses issuing a lot\nof devices to their employees.\n\n141\n00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.470\nThen there was shift towards\nbring your own device.\n\n142\n00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.655\nThen there's businesses also doing it\nwhere you have your own device but\n\n143\n00:07:46.655 --> 00:07:48.656\nyou can connect to their network.\n\n144\n00:07:48.656 --> 00:07:51.998\nBut if you connect to their network, then\nthere's a policy for that that says if you\n\n145\n00:07:51.998 --> 00:07:55.076\nconnect to their network, you've\ngotta sign something that says, well.\n\n146\n00:07:55.076 --> 00:07:59.808\nIf anything bad happens, and we need to\nwipe the device, we can wipe the device,\n\n147\n00:07:59.808 --> 00:08:04.760\nand thou shall not have an unencrypted\ndevice, and if you lose it, you'll report.\n\n148\n00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.990\nEven though it's your personal device,\nit touches our stuff.\n\n149\n00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.510\nSo they'll have that.\n\n150\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.850\nThen from the mobile\ndevice vendors themselves,\n\n151\n00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.880\nyou have people like\nSamsung is one of note.\n\n152\n00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.080\nI say Samsung from personal\nexperience right there.\n\n153\n00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.990\nThese devices when Samsung\nshipped these things initially.\n\n154\n00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.560\nThis model the newer model is all\nI've included they didn't have\n\n155\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.770\nthe same penetration onto\ngovernment markets, and\n\n156\n00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.290\nsome of those high security markets\nwhere security's a bigger issue.\n\n157\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.840\nSo what they did they\naddressed the problem.\n\n158\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.020\nThe problem was they didn't have,\nyou know,\n\n159\n00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.750\nto borrow one of the terms from the sys.\n\n160\n00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.880\nThey have, the sys, they used to\ncall it the chinese wall method.\n\n161\n00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.270\nModel of operating.\n\n162\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.035\nAnd they call it different now.\n\n163\n00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:59.165\nBut the chinese wall method means, you\nhave stuff over there and stuff over here.\n\n164\n00:08:59.165 --> 00:09:00.445\nAnd never shall the two meet.\n\n165\n00:09:00.445 --> 00:09:02.395\nYou know, if you are over in this state,\n\n166\n00:09:02.395 --> 00:09:04.965\nthat's isolated in the\ncompartmentalizements over in this state.\n\n167\n00:09:04.965 --> 00:09:07.005\nSo you can't touch both\nof them at the same time.\n\n168\n00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:08.175\nThey didn't have that before.\n\n169\n00:09:08.175 --> 00:09:10.955\nSo what they did was they introduced\nit through one of their product updates\n\n170\n00:09:10.955 --> 00:09:12.440\nsomething called Knox.\n\n171\n00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.880\nAnd what Knox does, and I think\nthey're up to the third version now.\n\n172\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.050\nKnox is something that\nallows you to have your\n\n173\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.700\ndata isolated on there so you can have\nyour business data compartmentalized,\n\n174\n00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.870\nfrom one another, and from your personal\nstuff on the exact same device.\n\n175\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.000\nAnd they have a whole trusted root model.\n\n176\n00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.495\nA trusted boot model\nthat has to be followed,\n\n177\n00:09:35.495 --> 00:09:42.320\nto make that actually still\nbe a usable device with Knox.\n\n178\n00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.920\nYou can actually break it,\n\n179\n00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.860\nif you are doing these things where you\nare rooting your device or something.\n\n180\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.480\nYou can break that model.\n\n181\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.730\nAnd you can tell right away.\n\n182\n00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.350\nWell, that device has been rooted.\n\n183\n00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.340\nIt would actually break\nthat Knox model and\n\n184\n00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.540\nallow people to access anything\non the device so therefore,\n\n185\n00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.970\nyou can't trust it to secure your business\ndata if that's what you're depending on.\n\n186\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:06.930\nSo, that's something that the businesses\nhave had coming in their favor but\n\n187\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.750\nnow they have to learn something\nelse new that came into play.\n\n188\n00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.396\nBecause it's,\n\n189\n00:10:10.396 --> 00:10:14.800\nwhen I have Knox on this device here,\nthere's actually an enterprise\n\n190\n00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.750\nversion of it too that plugs into all that\nthat does a whole other level beyond that.\n\n191\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.570\nSo, if you're relying on a bunch\nof these things coming in,\n\n192\n00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.640\nthat supports that and you're in\nan enterprise environment, guess what,\n\n193\n00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.390\nyou've got another level of\nmanagement that comes in that\n\n194\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.290\nmaybe you don't want to deal with,\nbut if it's bring your own device.\n\n195\n00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.230\nYou do have certain things\nthat do play into that.\n\n196\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.720\n>> And then you got all the different\noperating systems that are on these\n\n197\n00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.450\nmobile devices.\n\n198\n00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.210\nEach one of those is gonna have\nits own set of vulnerabilities and\n\n199\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.730\nthings that I've gotta deal with.\n\n200\n00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.840\n>> Yeah, that's another pain on top of it.\n\n201\n00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:51.040\nFor years those of us that have been\naround the IT field for long enough,\n\n202\n00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:58.070\nyou remember the bad old days where we had\nthis mismatch of different technologies.\n\n203\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.290\nI mean you remember that right?\n\n204\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.010\n>> Mm hm.\n>> I mean there was all sorts of stuff.\n\n205\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:06.210\nIt's like you could easily just side step\nto the next step going the heck is this?\n\n206\n00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.040\nWhat are they using?\n\n207\n00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.060\nIt's like this guy's using this.\n\n208\n00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:08.700\nWhat's using this?\n\n209\n00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.050\nThe next one over has something\ndifferent and so on and so forth.\n\n210\n00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:17.280\nIt was a mess and it was a pain having\nto deal with that as an IT admin.\n\n211\n00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.490\nWell, finally if a lot of businesses\nstart to get their act together and\n\n212\n00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.320\nstandardizing across the board.\n\n213\n00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.660\nWe'll start getting better\nmanagement strategies.\n\n214\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.310\nWe develop those policies,\nthose best practices.\n\n215\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.480\nAnd then even the advent of software\nthat would manage that forest made it\n\n216\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.580\na lot easier.\n\n217\n00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:36.320\nSo you start seeing these environments\nwhich were not totally homogenous but\n\n218\n00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.540\nthey are closer to it.\n\n219\n00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.800\nYou don't have a whole bunch of\ndifferent operating systems that\n\n220\n00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.880\nare completely unrelated.\n\n221\n00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.450\nWell, that problem why it may have\nbeen mitigated to a certain degree\n\n222\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.520\non the desktop and server side.\n\n223\n00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.100\nIt's been reintroduced through mobile OSs.\n\n224\n00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.990\nBecause mobile OSs, it's not enough to say\nthat you have a certain version of it.\n\n225\n00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.535\nI can assure you.\n\n226\n00:11:56.535 --> 00:12:00.325\nThese two devices here, these both\nrun the same version of Android, but\n\n227\n00:12:00.325 --> 00:12:02.225\nit's not the same version\nof Android as well.\n\n228\n00:12:02.225 --> 00:12:03.551\nIt sounds like I'm doing double speak.\n\n229\n00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:04.061\n>> It does.\n\n230\n00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:10.242\n>> Which is what I am, but it's not\nthe same because you've got an AT&T model,\n\n231\n00:12:10.242 --> 00:12:14.967\nof a Galaxy 4 and\nthen I got a Nexus 5 over here.\n\n232\n00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:17.877\nAnd this one I went through and\ncustom loaded everything.\n\n233\n00:12:17.877 --> 00:12:21.477\nAnd it was unlocked and\nrooted when I got it.\n\n234\n00:12:21.477 --> 00:12:25.927\nSo I got to set it up exactly\nthe way I wanted that custom stuff.\n\n235\n00:12:25.927 --> 00:12:29.660\nThis one was locked to the AT&T\nnetwork when I got it.\n\n236\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:34.130\nand that had sounds specific\nstuff loaded in to and\n\n237\n00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:39.380\nthat made it slow some people\ncall blockware stuff like that,\n\n238\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.717\nthe vendor ships on it Samsung\nhad on their had on their and\n\n239\n00:12:44.717 --> 00:12:50.150\ncustomizations their\nspecific update android even\n\n240\n00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.140\nWhen I got it had 42 and\nyou can update all the way to 5.\n\n241\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.060\nOn some vendors.\n\n242\n00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.615\nOr on some wireless providers.\n\n243\n00:12:58.615 --> 00:12:59.590\nAT&T you couldn't.\n\n244\n00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.300\nBecause they had to tweak\nit customize it and\n\n245\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.960\ndo a bunch of stuff to make it\nwork with the previous one.\n\n246\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.870\nIt was a mess so it's not the same thing.\n\n247\n00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.540\nI could apply the update here but\nI couldn't apply it here.\n\n248\n00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.880\nBecause there were different issues and\nheck that's already a mess.\n\n249\n00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.830\nThink about the issues that come in and\n\n250\n00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:19.870\nwhen you buy these devices,\nsince it came on AT&T,\n\n251\n00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:25.040\nthere specific things that happen with\nthis, but you can get them on T-Mobile,\n\n252\n00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.390\nyou can get them on Verizon, you can get\nthem on a bunch of different networks.\n\n253\n00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.040\nNothing says you can't do that.\n\n254\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.200\nEvery one of those networks tweaks it just\na little bit more and they even do stuff\n\n255\n00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.400\nto the boot loaders on it so it's not the\nsame device, really from our perspective.\n\n256\n00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.470\nThat's why if you ever\nhave to unlock a device,\n\n257\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:44.710\nyou've got to look at the vendor,\nor the wall's provider that got it.\n\n258\n00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.380\nIf it came from wall's provider as part of\na contract because you can't use the same\n\n259\n00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.905\ninstructions on all of them, you can break\nthe device, and make a nice paperweight.\n\n260\n00:13:51.905 --> 00:13:52.780\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n261\n00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.150\nfrom a security perspective that's\ndefinitely just insane for to have to\n\n262\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.140\ndeal with a bunch of, it's like,\noh we have a bunch of Android devices.\n\n263\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.070\nDo you really have a bunch\nof Android devices?\n\n264\n00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:06.760\nThis is maybe why you be able to say that\nin a generic sense, are they all the same?\n\n265\n00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.600\nWell they all run 5.2 do\nthey all run the same 5.2?\n\n266\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.840\nWhat's the difference?\n\n267\n00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.200\nCan you imagine telling someone what\nversion of XP Service Pack 2 do you have?\n\n268\n00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.160\nYou had like 32 bit and 64 bit,\n\n269\n00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.080\nstuff like that is about as far as\nit went if you even got that far.\n\n270\n00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.090\nAnd now it's like yeah we know\nit's a different version of that.\n\n271\n00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.860\nAnd it's like okay whatever.\n\n272\n00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.090\n>> And\nthen of course with the new technology and\n\n273\n00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:33.680\nall these operating systems that's gonna\nopen us up for new avenues of attack.\n\n274\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.900\nYeah, that's the one constant,\nif you can call it that.\n\n275\n00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.620\nThere's, every new technology,\n\n276\n00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.230\nevery new system brings new\nthreats along the way with it.\n\n277\n00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.900\nIt's just the way it works is you've\ngot a new technology out there,\n\n278\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.580\nsomeone's gonna find a way to attack it\nand monkey with it and cause you to have\n\n279\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.920\nbad day, pull your hair out,\nwhatever it is, or D, all of the above.\n\n280\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.890\nAnd, they've really become quite\nclever and what they've done, and\n\n281\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:07.300\nhow they kind of pound on these devices,\nthere's people that actively do this.\n\n282\n00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.790\nThat's their thing.\n\n283\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:09.740\nWhat else do they do?\n\n284\n00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.980\nThey just sit there and\n\n285\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.810\ncome up with these little ways to monkey\nwith stuff, seems like some of them do.\n\n286\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.950\nAnd they found all sorts of interesting\nthings they could do with the newer\n\n287\n00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.750\ntechnologies, plus the old ones.\n\n288\n00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.880\nSometimes it's the old technology\ngets you that loophole through there.\n\n289\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.987\nRemember the one we talked about\nearly on in all these episodes,\n\n290\n00:15:27.987 --> 00:15:33.159\none of the things we talked about was SSL\nand TLS support, and then we talked about\n\n291\n00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:38.048\nthat poodle attack, where you could\ncause the new technology to roll over.\n\n292\n00:15:38.048 --> 00:15:41.408\nAnd give you access the old stuff\nwhere you can punch right in and\n\n293\n00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:42.622\nbypass a lot of stuff.\n\n294\n00:15:42.622 --> 00:15:43.829\nThat's a nasty one.\n\n295\n00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:46.906\nPeople were relying on some\nof the new technology.\n\n296\n00:15:46.906 --> 00:15:50.227\nThat allows you to rollback to the old\none, which is still there by the way.\n\n297\n00:15:50.227 --> 00:15:51.870\nThat feature's still there.\n\n298\n00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.510\nIt requires you to know about it and\ndisable the ability for it to do that.\n\n299\n00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.260\nThat's the adapt a new\ntechnology part again.\n\n300\n00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.710\nAs far as the attacks go, in general,\n\n301\n00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:07.480\nwe could go across a whole spectrum\nof attacks but there's a few of note.\n\n302\n00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.790\nThere's a few that are really are of\nnote that have emerged over the last\n\n303\n00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.570\nhandful of years, or months.\n\n304\n00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.380\nHeck, we can even say months,\nin some cases,\n\n305\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.910\nthey've really come out of the woodwork.\n\n306\n00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:28.140\nI've got three on my list that I think are\nkind of worthwhile mentioning because they\n\n307\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:33.960\neither represent a new threat, or a newer\nthreat, or a reemergence of an old one.\n\n308\n00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.940\nWe have one of the ones that\nactually gotten a lot of press or\n\n309\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.980\nshould be getting a lot more\nthan it has been, is RansomWare.\n\n310\n00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:49.530\nRansomWare is a relatively new type\nof malware in the scheme of things\n\n311\n00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.920\nthat basically holds your data hostage.\n\n312\n00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:59.290\nIt finds it and it does something to\nit to prevent you from accessing it.\n\n313\n00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.270\nBasically, is doing a stick up\non you saying, I got your stuff.\n\n314\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.066\nIf you ever want to see if alive-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n315\n00:17:04.066 --> 00:17:05.946\n>> You gotta pay this amount of money.\n\n316\n00:17:05.946 --> 00:17:10.980\nThey used to have a set of viruses,\ncalled cryptoviruses that did this,\n\n317\n00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.820\nthat were doing the same type of thing but\nRansom viruses\n\n318\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.760\ncan be a lot more overt about it,\nthey will really put it out there.\n\n319\n00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.980\nThey also have sneaky ways of\ngetting into your environment and\n\n320\n00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.980\nreally performing that hold up.\n\n321\n00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.240\nThey've already developed one.\n\n322\n00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.800\nThere's already one being seen in\nthe wild, if you believe it or\n\n323\n00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.100\nnot, that looks like it's an upgrade.\n\n324\n00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.900\nIt's starting the upgrade for Windows 10.\n\n325\n00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.620\nWhen you start it up, it actually goes\nthrough and sweeps your drive and\n\n326\n00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.385\ngrabs the data and encrypts it and\nsays guess what, I got all your stuff.\n\n327\n00:17:45.385 --> 00:17:48.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You didn't do an upgrade at all.\n\n328\n00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.480\nIt just went ahead, no,\nI grabbed that stuff.\n\n329\n00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.990\nYou start downloading it, started it, and\n\n330\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:56.710\nthen put it on your system and\nthen grant some stuff out to you.\n\n331\n00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:03.460\nThey work, they did a study,\nin UK, I think, last year?\n\n332\n00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:08.830\nThey did a study on it and\nthey were trying to get a feel for\n\n333\n00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:14.230\nhow many people would actually fall for\nthese RansomWare types of attacks and\n\n334\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.310\nhow much it actually cost people.\n\n335\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:21.592\nThey figured out that if you translate to\nU.S. dollars, it was something like $1.8,\n\n336\n00:18:21.592 --> 00:18:24.920\n$1.9 million, people over\nthe course of 12 months had paid,\n\n337\n00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:30.129\nprivate individuals had paid,\nto get their stuff out of being hijacked.\n\n338\n00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.470\nIn the scheme in things, it doesn't sound,\n1.8, 1.9, it doesn't sound like a lot.\n\n339\n00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.980\nIt's a significant amount, period.\n\n340\n00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.990\n>> Anytime you put an M behind a number,\nfor me, that sounds like a lot to me.\n\n341\n00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.935\n>> Yeah, that's the way I look at it.\n\n342\n00:18:43.935 --> 00:18:47.860\nYou see some of the other thefts in\nthe cyber world that are much bigger, so\n\n343\n00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.040\nrelative to those, fine, but\n\n344\n00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.250\nthat's still a pretty big number,\nall things considered.\n\n345\n00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:59.719\nThen you gonna factor in that some of\nthese ransoms are just a couple of hundred\n\n346\n00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:02.353\ndollars, $400 or something like that.\n\n347\n00:19:02.353 --> 00:19:09.375\nWhy that hurts, if your the person having\nto pay that, it's a drop in the bucket.\n\n348\n00:19:09.375 --> 00:19:12.825\nThen overall stuff, it takes a lot of\nthose things to add up to that number,\n\n349\n00:19:12.825 --> 00:19:13.345\nas we know.\n\n350\n00:19:15.025 --> 00:19:18.455\nFigure that out, how many people got\nhit just off of that number, and\n\n351\n00:19:18.455 --> 00:19:21.695\nyou gotta figure there's probably\na significant number that are embarrassed\n\n352\n00:19:21.695 --> 00:19:22.725\nthat didn't report it.\n\n353\n00:19:22.725 --> 00:19:28.160\nThere may be another doubling\nof that number, a tripling or\n\n354\n00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.875\nquadrupling of the number, even, of people\ndidn't report because they feel stupid.\n\n355\n00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:35.370\n>> Absolutely, but\nthen the good news is, of course,\n\n356\n00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:39.100\nwith all these new attacks,\nwe get new defenses.\n\n357\n00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.160\n>> Yeah, that's the other side,\nwe're hoping.\n\n358\n00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.930\n>> Keep our fingers crossed anyway.\n\n359\n00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.840\n>> It's a cat and mouse game.\n\n360\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.600\nThat's the term they\nalways use to describe it.\n\n361\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.720\nCat and mouse game is that\none side develops something,\n\n362\n00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.250\nthe other side develops something to\ncounter it and that's going to be\n\n363\n00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:00.549\nan evergoing struggle between good and\nevil, I guess it's gonna continue on.\n\n364\n00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:02.920\nThey've developed these threats,\n\n365\n00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.280\nwe've developed stuff on\nthe other side to be safer.\n\n366\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.776\nOne of these things, when I was talking\nabout these Samsung devices that have\n\n367\n00:20:09.776 --> 00:20:14.910\nKNOX, that if you are trying to alter your\ndevice or root it, as some of us have.\n\n368\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.350\nI wouldn't have any knowledge of that,\nrooting a device, by the way.\n\n369\n00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.880\n>> Of course not.\n\n370\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.470\n>> I never did a search thing.\n\n371\n00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:26.995\nIt's illegal and\nit's just not a good thing to do.\n\n372\n00:20:26.995 --> 00:20:32.285\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Come on, I would never void a warranty.\n\n373\n00:20:32.285 --> 00:20:36.490\n[LAUGH] When Samsung came\nout with that KNOX stuff,\n\n374\n00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:41.350\nit was something that was designed\nto address a specific problem,\n\n375\n00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.790\nisolating the stuff and\nkeep stuff from touching one another, and\n\n376\n00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:49.550\nkeep it all nice, safe and secure and\nit does do that job pretty well.\n\n377\n00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.070\nIn fact, really well.\n\n378\n00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:54.480\nI talked to people that I know that use\nit, they're like oh, this is great.\n\n379\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.765\nThey really love that feature now that\nthey've gotten comfortable with it.\n\n380\n00:20:58.765 --> 00:21:02.885\nThere's been a lot of defensive\nthings they've put out.\n\n381\n00:21:02.885 --> 00:21:04.335\nIn the mobile world,\n\n382\n00:21:04.335 --> 00:21:09.065\nit's been stuff like KNOX, it's been\nmore development of anti-malware and\n\n383\n00:21:09.065 --> 00:21:12.932\nstuff that targets that specific malware\nthat's present on the mobile area.\n\n384\n00:21:12.932 --> 00:21:14.742\nIt's been better protection for\n\n385\n00:21:14.742 --> 00:21:18.762\nwireless technologies that are built\ninto those mobile devices.\n\n386\n00:21:18.762 --> 00:21:20.982\nOn the other side, on the desktop level,\n\n387\n00:21:20.982 --> 00:21:23.752\nit's been new technologies\non that side too.\n\n388\n00:21:23.752 --> 00:21:28.122\nMicrosoft, for one,\nfrom Vista forwards had that UAC,\n\n389\n00:21:28.122 --> 00:21:30.592\nthat's something that got introduced,\ndeveloped,\n\n390\n00:21:30.592 --> 00:21:34.770\nand refined, and that provides\na pretty good measure of security.\n\n391\n00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:41.580\nMicrosoft has emphasized stuff like\nencryption more using Bitlocker.\n\n392\n00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:46.640\nEven though they use the word encryption,\nthey don't make a big deal about\n\n393\n00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.810\nwhat type of encryption or anything,\nunless you want to go look for that.\n\n394\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.620\nThey just say you can protect the contents\nof your drive if it's get stolen,\n\n395\n00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.600\nno one can get it by using Bitlocker.\n\n396\n00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.429\nThat sounds good.\n\n397\n00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.950\nThere's been this evolution of things\nto make current technology stronger and\n\n398\n00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.775\nmore robust and\nmove away from some of these old models.\n\n399\n00:22:05.775 --> 00:22:09.880\nYou're even seeing stuff where they are\ncleaning up after themselves on some of\n\n400\n00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.700\nthese old technologies.\n\n401\n00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:17.070\nMicrosoft has been more aggressive\nif you really pay attention to it.\n\n402\n00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.850\nThey've been much more aggressive\nat cutting off support for\n\n403\n00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:22.140\nolder versions of their software recently.\n\n404\n00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.920\nThat's not something they always did.\n\n405\n00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:29.892\nThat's something that they took them quite\na while to do when you go back and look.\n\n406\n00:22:29.892 --> 00:22:34.980\nI was surprised to find out that Windows\n1 support was only discontinued,\n\n407\n00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:35.990\nI think, about a decade ago.\n\n408\n00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.960\nYou still could have got support on that.\n\n409\n00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.590\nIf you got it, sorry, I warned you now.\n\n410\n00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.333\n>> Just out of luck.\n\n411\n00:22:43.333 --> 00:22:44.810\n>> Yeah, just missed.\n\n412\n00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:50.688\nThey just finally officially, I do believe\nit was after the year 2000 they did it,\n\n413\n00:22:50.688 --> 00:22:54.809\nbut it's something that they\nfinally went ahead and did it.\n\n414\n00:22:54.809 --> 00:22:59.245\nI think it's because they just never\nreally got around to it, in that case.\n\n415\n00:22:59.245 --> 00:23:01.244\nBut other technologies that they've had,\n\n416\n00:23:01.244 --> 00:23:04.432\nthey've gotten much more aggressive\nat saying that's deprecated,\n\n417\n00:23:04.432 --> 00:23:08.120\nthat's deprecated, that's going away,\nwe're gonna kill support for that.\n\n418\n00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.724\nThey've been a lot more\naggressive about that and\n\n419\n00:23:10.724 --> 00:23:12.957\nadopting that Apple type model of things.\n\n420\n00:23:12.957 --> 00:23:16.827\nAfter a few years, you got the old stuff,\nyou got an antique,\n\n421\n00:23:16.827 --> 00:23:17.897\nwe're not upgrading it anymore.\n\n422\n00:23:17.897 --> 00:23:19.967\nYou want it to do new stuff,\nbuy new stuff.\n\n423\n00:23:19.967 --> 00:23:21.347\nThat's the way they look at.\n\n424\n00:23:21.347 --> 00:23:25.757\nThey're being more aggressive about that\nstuff and I'd also say as far as defensive\n\n425\n00:23:25.757 --> 00:23:29.727\nmeasures, something that fits in there\nis also the administrative side of it.\n\n426\n00:23:29.727 --> 00:23:34.240\nA lot of vendors are becoming\nbetter at listening to\n\n427\n00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.260\nthe people that are actually using\ntheir products and submitting things.\n\n428\n00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.729\nIt used to be that, who cares,\nno one's ever gonna do that.\n\n429\n00:23:40.729 --> 00:23:43.880\nYou used to always hear that,\nit got under my skin a lot, and\n\n430\n00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.289\nthose other security people, the same way.\n\n431\n00:23:46.289 --> 00:23:48.170\nIt's like Yeah, I thought of it.\n\n432\n00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.974\nThat you think I'm not some sort of\ngenius, that no one's ever thought of it,\n\n433\n00:23:50.974 --> 00:23:54.140\nthere's other people that have thought of\nthat, it's just that no one's gonna do it.\n\n434\n00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.330\nIt's like I always say,\nwhy do people do this stuff?\n\n435\n00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.658\nJust because you can't think of a reason\ndoesn't mean someone's not gonna do it.\n\n436\n00:23:59.658 --> 00:24:04.590\nIt's the same reason for\nlike climbing Mount Everest.\n\n437\n00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.630\nThere's nothing up there.\n\n438\n00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:07.850\nThere's literally nothing up there.\n\n439\n00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.857\nYou're not going up there to buy\nreal estate or watch the view-\n\n440\n00:24:09.857 --> 00:24:10.553\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n441\n00:24:10.553 --> 00:24:12.075\n>> All that much.\n\n442\n00:24:12.075 --> 00:24:13.633\nView as in looking around,\n\n443\n00:24:13.633 --> 00:24:16.158\nnot that program that's on in the morning-\n\n444\n00:24:16.158 --> 00:24:16.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Watch it.\n\n445\n00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:21.066\nAnd so there's that's you're\ndoing because you can.\n\n446\n00:24:21.066 --> 00:24:23.190\nAs the saying goes, why you climb\na mountain because it's there.\n\n447\n00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:28.421\nSo businesses have finally realized that\nthe vendors of these things have realized\n\n448\n00:24:28.421 --> 00:24:33.200\nthat if you develop a product and it's\ngot a hole in it someone will find it and\n\n449\n00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.135\npunch a hole through it\njust because they can.\n\n450\n00:24:36.135 --> 00:24:39.895\nNot because there's a motivation there,\nthey just want to tick you off and\n\n451\n00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:43.389\nsmile when they watch you kind of rip\nyour hair out going why didn't I listen.\n\n452\n00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:49.340\nSo perhaps things betting much\nbetter people adopting more\n\n453\n00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.070\ntechnology more integrated\nstuff into products.\n\n454\n00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.290\nIt's been minor things too.\n\n455\n00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:58.070\nYou're seeing more stuff where they're\nsecuring stuff like Bluetooth and\n\n456\n00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.470\nstuff like that in devices.\n\n457\n00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.940\nIt used to be that Bluetooth and\n\n458\n00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.920\nyou remember the days when Bluetooth was,\nI know I remember when it wasn't that\n\n459\n00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.060\nlong ago where Bluetooth\nyou got in on any device.\n\n460\n00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.590\nIt was turned on and discoverable.\n\n461\n00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.895\nIt was basically, raising its hand\ntelling everyone it was there.\n\n462\n00:25:12.895 --> 00:25:14.585\nThat's not done that much anymore.\n\n463\n00:25:14.585 --> 00:25:17.895\nAnd even when you can\nmake device discoverable.\n\n464\n00:25:17.895 --> 00:25:21.345\nA lot of times, when you click the button,\nit says I'll be discoverable for the next\n\n465\n00:25:21.345 --> 00:25:24.685\nfive minutes just in case you forget and\nyou pair something up with something else.\n\n466\n00:25:24.685 --> 00:25:27.430\nAnd you forget,\nit will turn itself off automatically.\n\n467\n00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.800\nThat's a major shift in\nthe way they've done stuff.\n\n468\n00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.974\nJust a minor thing feature,\nbut the implementation of\n\n469\n00:25:32.974 --> 00:25:37.463\nthat feature is a major thing in the\nschema stuff it protected a lot of people.\n\n470\n00:25:37.463 --> 00:25:38.484\n>> Absolutely.\n\n471\n00:25:38.484 --> 00:25:43.123\nAnd the last thing you've got down here,\nsituation awareness or\n\n472\n00:25:43.123 --> 00:25:45.097\nas Ross likes to say unagi.\n\n473\n00:25:45.097 --> 00:25:47.863\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n474\n00:25:47.863 --> 00:25:50.017\nit's something that we\nhave to keep in mind.\n\n475\n00:25:50.017 --> 00:25:51.850\nWe have to be aware of what's going on.\n\n476\n00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:56.440\nWe have to notice that someone's bringing\nin an Apple watch into our environment or\n\n477\n00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:02.750\nthat somebody's running that latest iOS or\ntheir latest Android operating system.\n\n478\n00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:08.480\n>> Yeah, you've really got to\nmaintain a good idea or know\n\n479\n00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.410\nwhat's in your environment as well as what\ncould be coming into your environment.\n\n480\n00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.590\nWhat new threats could be emerging?\n\n481\n00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:18.650\nI think of stuff, when I think\nabout situational awareness there's\n\n482\n00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:23.150\na fighter pilot during the Korean War that\ndid that, he was in World War II as well.\n\n483\n00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:28.230\nBut he was Fred Boots Blassy,\nhis nickname was Boots for\n\n484\n00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:33.080\nwhatever reason and he developed\na strategy of thinking in the air,\n\n485\n00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.110\ndogfighting, that relied on\nsomething called an OODA loop.\n\n486\n00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:40.050\nSome of you may have heard of that,\nO-O-D-A.\n\n487\n00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:44.340\nAnd what that meant was when he developed\nit if you are a fighter pilot saying\n\n488\n00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.690\nthat it was an acronym that meant,\nobserve the situation,\n\n489\n00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:52.040\norient yourself to the situation,\nmake a decision and act on the situation.\n\n490\n00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.010\nAnd so it was a really quick way of\nsaying that you're out there, and\n\n491\n00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:00.030\nyou're in the air and\nyou see a dangerous situation.\n\n492\n00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.730\nYou're supposed to see what it is,\nfigure out how you're gonna approach it,\n\n493\n00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.220\nmake a decision on what option you're\ngonna choose and then act on it.\n\n494\n00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.720\nAnd the idea there is that the other\nguy's gonna be doing the same thing.\n\n495\n00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.730\nEither consciously or subconsciously\ngonna be doing the same thing and\n\n496\n00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:16.300\nwhat you wanna do is you wanna have that\nloop that when you complete the act,\n\n497\n00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.910\nyou see what the results\nof your action are and\n\n498\n00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.420\nthen you observe the new situation and\nkeep going around.\n\n499\n00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.510\nAnd you're trying to\ncomplete that loop and\n\n500\n00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.260\nmake that loop smaller\ntimewise than the other guys.\n\n501\n00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.860\nSo the smaller, the smaller that loop,\nthe quicker you can close it and\n\n502\n00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.075\nreact to things the better\nchance you have in the case of\n\n503\n00:27:33.075 --> 00:27:39.550\nhaving a fighter pilot of getting\nyour fangs out and killing the guy.\n\n504\n00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.600\nThat's the end result there.\n\n505\n00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:49.600\nWe can apply the same process here,\nend user does something and you kill him.\n\n506\n00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.310\nNo, no.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n507\n00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.280\n>> That's all I'm saying,\n\n508\n00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.480\nthat's an easy way to solve it.\n\n509\n00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.260\nWhat it is, is that you have\nthe same type of situation,\n\n510\n00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.930\nyou can use it in a lot of things,\nit's the same process.\n\n511\n00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:03.710\nAs an IT person, you can see\nwhat the threat situation is and\n\n512\n00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:05.650\nget a good idea what the picture is.\n\n513\n00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.862\nAnd then figure out what your approach\nis gonna be or what approaches you have.\n\n514\n00:28:08.862 --> 00:28:11.760\nAnd make a decision on which one\nyou're gonna use and then act on it.\n\n515\n00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.440\nSee what the results of that\naction are and keep going around.\n\n516\n00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.880\nIt still works in that environment.\n\n517\n00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.930\nSo that's what you're trying to do,\nyou're trying to keep a good situational\n\n518\n00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.140\nawareness and once your head on your\nshoulders or what the picture looks like.\n\n519\n00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.875\nAnd always keep yourself constantly\nin the best position you can\n\n520\n00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:32.591\nto make the best decision and get the best\nresult out of the decision you act upon.\n\n521\n00:28:32.591 --> 00:28:33.729\n>> Very good.\n\n522\n00:28:33.729 --> 00:28:36.760\nYeah, very important to\nstay on top of thing.\n\n523\n00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.340\nAnd really that's kind of the underlying\ntheme over the last few episodes.\n\n524\n00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.490\nMaking sure that we're staying\naware of what's going on,\n\n525\n00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.030\nup on the latest technologies,\nup on the latest operating systems, tax,\n\n526\n00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:50.330\ndefenses, everything\nabout keeping informed.\n\n527\n00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.410\nWhich we're trying to do for you here so.\n\n528\n00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:53.003\n>> Kill your users.\n\n529\n00:28:53.003 --> 00:28:53.804\n>> Or kill your users.\n\n530\n00:28:53.804 --> 00:28:54.757\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n531\n00:28:54.757 --> 00:28:55.720\n>> That's works too.\n\n532\n00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.098\n>> All right, there's not anything\nelse we wanna add to the episode.\n\n533\n00:28:59.098 --> 00:29:03.140\n>> No, I think the kill the users kind\nof ended that conversation right there.\n\n534\n00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.657\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No,\n\n535\n00:29:04.657 --> 00:29:08.261\nI think we got it you kind of got\nthe idea, you adopt new technology,\n\n536\n00:29:08.261 --> 00:29:12.119\nthat there's going to be any new\ntechnology, whether it's new to you or\n\n537\n00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:15.810\nnew to the industry in general\nrepresents interesting challenge.\n\n538\n00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:20.980\nWe use mobile devices as an example of\nit because they're so common nowadays.\n\n539\n00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:26.830\nAnd they're such a mess, a bird's nest\nwhatever of issues could happen there.\n\n540\n00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.750\nBut it's something you can deal with\ngiven that you are in the right mindset,\n\n541\n00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.690\nyou're doing your research.\n\n542\n00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:35.468\nAnd keeping your head on your shoulders\nas far as situational awareness goes.\n\n543\n00:29:35.468 --> 00:29:37.709\n>> This is not limited just\nby mobile device, right?\n\n544\n00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:39.074\nWhen you say new technology,\n\n545\n00:29:39.074 --> 00:29:42.340\nit can be new protocols we\nare implementing like IPv6 is being.\n\n546\n00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.740\nBrought into our network this month.\n\n547\n00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.427\nWell, that opens up a whole new set of\nstuff and that I've got to worry about.\n\n548\n00:29:46.427 --> 00:29:47.228\n>> Yeah.\n\n549\n00:29:47.228 --> 00:29:51.693\nAnytime you're putting\nsomething in that environment,\n\n550\n00:29:51.693 --> 00:29:55.529\npresumably you have some\nsort of balance before.\n\n551\n00:29:55.529 --> 00:30:01.760\nI heard someone explain it,\na former CEO at a company I work at.\n\n552\n00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:06.230\nShe said, that people when someone ask\nher in the interview she said, that she\n\n553\n00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:10.150\nseems you got a perfect life and she said,\nshe doesn't believe in perfection.\n\n554\n00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.480\nAnywhere she goes,\nlife isn't anything about perfection.\n\n555\n00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.880\nShe says, it's juggling a lot of balls and\n\n556\n00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:20.380\ncatching those balls for it hit the ground\nand to her that's how she looks at it.\n\n557\n00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:24.940\nSo you may be in that situation where\nyou've got the balls in the air and\n\n558\n00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.620\nyou're juggling them doing that.\n\n559\n00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.550\nBut all I gotta do is just throw\nan extra one in there, and\n\n560\n00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.510\nthat's gonna cause you to really be oh,\nI gotta adjust to it.\n\n561\n00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.450\nWho knows you may drop one.\n\n562\n00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.160\nThat's gonna happen now and then.\n\n563\n00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:41.880\nSo any new technology\nrepresents that extra\n\n564\n00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.740\nball that's being introduced to\nyou is your juggling act and\n\n565\n00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:49.170\nyou're trying to keep some sort sense of\nsemblance of order and balance to that.\n\n566\n00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:52.365\nAnd I'm trying to disrupt that\nbalance by introducing a new threat or\n\n567\n00:30:52.365 --> 00:30:55.295\nvulnerability in the form of a new\ntechnology or what have you.\n\n568\n00:30:55.295 --> 00:30:56.760\n>> All right, good.\n\n569\n00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.490\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen\nthat's gonna do it for another episode of\n\n570\n00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:03.300\nITProTV, signing off I'm Mike Roderick\n>> And I'm Shawn Adriano\n\n571\n00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.132\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:15.650\nI'm your host Mike Roderick\nwith me today is Sean Orianno.\n\n4\n00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.610\nHow are you Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.140\n>> Doing pretty good How are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.780\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.980\nWe've got another exciting episode in our\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner\n\n8\n00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.250\nseries coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.111\nThis is what we're gonna be talking about,\nnew media, and\n\n10\n00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:28.355\nwhat it means to our\nenterprise environment.\n\n11\n00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:31.584\nAnd Sean we're not talking about\ncassette tapes or eight tracks,\n\n12\n00:00:31.584 --> 00:00:33.440\nthat type of media right?\n\n13\n00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.495\n>> Well that would be new to most people.\n\n14\n00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:36.808\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'll tell ya,\n\n15\n00:00:36.808 --> 00:00:37.963\nthat's bleeding edge technology.\n\n16\n00:00:37.963 --> 00:00:40.447\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:40.447 --> 00:00:41.164\n>> I see where\n\n18\n00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:44.766\nthe younger generation says,\nwhat the heck is this?\n\n19\n00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.880\n[LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.675\n>> But really we're talking about all\nthe different types of social media and\n\n21\n00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:51.240\nthings like that that are available now.\n\n22\n00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.147\nAnd that our end users are using,\nand sometimes during work, and\n\n23\n00:00:55.147 --> 00:00:58.400\nwith work information, and-\n>> Ugh, yeah, all of the above.\n\n24\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.700\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n25\n00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:07.010\n>> It's brought up in the CASP,\nand it rightfully should be there.\n\n26\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.050\nBecause it's something that they still\ncharacterize it in the CASP of being new.\n\n27\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.550\nWe've been through this kind of this\nmeat grinder a few times already.\n\n28\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.810\nWhat was it before Facebook?\n\n29\n00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.160\nWe had MySpace and\nthat's been gone for quite a while.\n\n30\n00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.790\nSo, obviously social media is\nnot something that is gonna be\n\n31\n00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.010\na brand new technology.\n\n32\n00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.620\nIt's just people are still\nkind of adapting to it,\n\n33\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.080\npeople's behaviors are still changing\nin relation to social media,\n\n34\n00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.425\nso that's molded the way people work and\nlive and do their stuff.\n\n35\n00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:48.520\nThey're just used to\nbeing a lot more open.\n\n36\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.950\nAnd if they want to do that in their\npersonal lives, that's fine, but from\n\n37\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.940\na workplace perspective and a security\nmanager's perspective, which we are,\n\n38\n00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.290\nthat represents a bunch of challenges\nthere that we have to adapt to\n\n39\n00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.760\nand figure out how we're gonna able to\ntake care of things, and it's not easy.\n\n40\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.500\n>> What is it, so what would you say\nis the big concern with social media?\n\n41\n00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.590\nWhy are we so concerned?\n\n42\n00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.830\nWhy do I care if my users are on Facebook?\n\n43\n00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.544\n>> Well, you think about it,\nwhen people go on Facebook and Twitter and\n\n44\n00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:24.934\nInstagram and any one of the social\nmedia sites that you want to,\n\n45\n00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:27.147\nI almost said social services.\n\n46\n00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.064\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n47\n00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:35.110\n>> [LAUGH] Oops, so\nIt almost turned to a political rant.\n\n48\n00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.250\nYeah any of the new\nsocial media platforms,\n\n49\n00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.290\nI mean there's just tons of them.\n\n50\n00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.827\nI know there's way more than that, I just\ncan't think of it off of the top of my\n\n51\n00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:45.590\nhead right now, and I don't need to think\nabout it off the top of my head right now.\n\n52\n00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.279\nYou get the point.\n\n53\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.250\nThe danger with those is, there's so\nmany ways to share information, there's so\n\n54\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.810\nmany ways for people to network, and\nthere's so many people that honestly do\n\n55\n00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.030\nnot understand the security\nimplications of it.\n\n56\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.240\nAnd some that don't even care.\n\n57\n00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.970\nThey're just hey, what?\n\n58\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.090\nEither I'm at is, so\nno one's gonna be looking for it.\n\n59\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.950\nOr out of sight, out of mind.\n\n60\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.576\nOr they're just like hey, I'm a star.\n\n61\n00:03:08.576 --> 00:03:11.983\nYou hear that a lot.\n\n62\n00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.783\nAll right.\n\n63\n00:03:13.783 --> 00:03:16.000\nI joke around, going out with my friends,\ngoing I'm famous.\n\n64\n00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.700\nI'm not famous, but I joke around and\nkid around like that, but\n\n65\n00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.550\nsome people really\nactually believe they are.\n\n66\n00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.278\nI mean, look at the number of profiles and\ngroups on Facebook for\n\n67\n00:03:24.278 --> 00:03:29.249\npeople that you've never heard of, they're\nreally just some person just working at\n\n68\n00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.940\nmaybe a 7-Eleven, no offense,\nif you work at a 7-Eleven.\n\n69\n00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.820\nAnd they're modelling on the side, so now\nall of the sudden they're a public figure.\n\n70\n00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.250\nIt's like, you're not a public figure.\n\n71\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.390\nYou're someone that works at 7-Eleven,\nand puts on a bikini, and takes pictures.\n\n72\n00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.830\nThat's what you do okay\n[LAUGH] no offense.\n\n73\n00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.050\nYou've gotta start somewhere,\nbut you aren't that public yet.\n\n74\n00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.630\nSo you see that sort of thing and\npeople believe that and they're\n\n75\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.670\nwilling to share everything out, every\nlittle detail, everyone's got an opinion.\n\n76\n00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.651\nI mean there's so many things that go\nwith social media which can impact you\n\n77\n00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:04.400\ndirectly or indirectly.\n\n78\n00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.970\nYou may not expect some of these things.\n\n79\n00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.221\nAnd one of the things we have with social\nmedia that you really kind of think about\n\n80\n00:04:10.221 --> 00:04:13.584\nis people posting company secrets,\nperhaps, or something,\n\n81\n00:04:13.584 --> 00:04:15.990\nthey do an over-share on something.\n\n82\n00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.310\nOr they have a picture of something\nthey're not supposed to that they put\n\n83\n00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.160\nonline.\n\n84\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.070\nThose are the ones we think about, but\n\n85\n00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.960\nthere's other ones that come as\nresult of the usage of social media.\n\n86\n00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.840\nOne of them we get is people\nsaying stuff that's maybe\n\n87\n00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.480\nracially charged could be one, or they say\nsomething that's offensive in another way.\n\n88\n00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.640\nOr just any one of a number of things\nthat someone turns around and goes, hey,\n\n89\n00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.550\nI'm offended by that, or\nthat's libel, or what have you.\n\n90\n00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.420\nIf they're doing it on your dime and\nthey trace it back to that,\n\n91\n00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.550\nthere is the possibility,\nespecially, if they can say, hey,\n\n92\n00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.240\nthis person's representing\nthe company when they do this, and\n\n93\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.510\nthey decide to fly off the handle,\nyou're gonna be held responsible for that.\n\n94\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.670\nThat's a big liability issue.\n\n95\n00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.590\nSo, they go out and say this stuff and\n\n96\n00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.940\npeople may ostracize them,\nand maybe, a backlash on it.\n\n97\n00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.779\nBut, you know, guess what,\nif you're associated with them,\n\n98\n00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.683\nyou may very well catch\nthe foul onto that.\n\n99\n00:05:14.683 --> 00:05:21.404\nAnd that's also become a really\nreally really big problem.\n\n100\n00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:25.509\nBusinesses have started to realize that\nmore, it's like hey we're liable for\n\n101\n00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:26.650\nthis stuff.\n\n102\n00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.476\nNow even today you're seeing cases where\nsomeone, there's fall outs of a business,\n\n103\n00:05:31.476 --> 00:05:35.642\nbecause even though they're not\nrepresenting the business themselves,\n\n104\n00:05:35.642 --> 00:05:38.220\nthey have a private social media account,\nand\n\n105\n00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.755\nthey're just doing it\nas a private citizen.\n\n106\n00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:44.915\nYou get outraged enough, they will\ntrack down where that person works and\n\n107\n00:05:44.915 --> 00:05:46.000\npost that online.\n\n108\n00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.482\nSo now the business is\ngetting hammered by stuff.\n\n109\n00:05:47.482 --> 00:05:49.951\nAnd the one I think of right now,\n\n110\n00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:55.351\nwhich isn't exactly the type of\nsituation we're talking about, but\n\n111\n00:05:55.351 --> 00:06:00.494\nit is a close enough example to show\nthe type of stuff that happens.\n\n112\n00:06:00.494 --> 00:06:04.750\nThe one that's made\nthe news now is that guy,\n\n113\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.350\nthat dentist that shot that\nlion with a crossbow in Africa,\n\n114\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:17.150\nand it's a big deal just because of\nthe situation it occurred under.\n\n115\n00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.980\nHe went under there as just a private\nindividual doing that and they've tracked\n\n116\n00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.350\ndown the business which he happens to own\ncuz he's a dentist here in the states.\n\n117\n00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.281\nThey tracked down the business, and\n\n118\n00:06:27.281 --> 00:06:30.154\nthey were actually protesting\noutside the business.\n\n119\n00:06:30.154 --> 00:06:33.755\nAnd the businesses had to close, and\nso the employees that are there,\n\n120\n00:06:33.755 --> 00:06:36.720\nthey can't work as part of that,\nas fallout for it.\n\n121\n00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.430\nThen they've got the protests,\nthey said the police have\n\n122\n00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.801\nhad to step up a presence in that area\nbecause of all the extra people, and\n\n123\n00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:45.198\nthey had concern that\nsomething's gonna happen.\n\n124\n00:06:45.198 --> 00:06:48.620\nI mean so\nthere's a lot of fallout going with it.\n\n125\n00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.630\nEven though the guy never really\nmade anything about his business.\n\n126\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.803\nHe just, hey, you know, I bagged a lion\nover there and that was enough to spark\n\n127\n00:06:56.803 --> 00:07:00.802\nthis huge outrage that people were going,\nI'm going to find out who he is.\n\n128\n00:07:00.802 --> 00:07:07.860\nAnd they caused a lot of grief with\nhis employees at the very least.\n\n129\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.490\nSo that could happen to businesses too.\n\n130\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.151\nThat could happen with businesses\nwhere you have an employee doing that.\n\n131\n00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:17.540\nAn employee says something and doing that.\n\n132\n00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.848\nI mean police departments are seeing that\nall over the place here in the states.\n\n133\n00:07:20.848 --> 00:07:24.890\nYou get a bad cop here or\nthere that does something dumb,\n\n134\n00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.700\nevery job has someone\nthat does something dumb.\n\n135\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.357\nWe know that.\n\n136\n00:07:29.357 --> 00:07:31.300\n[LAUGH] You may be sitting\nnext to the person.\n\n137\n00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.397\nIf you don't know that person from your\nbusiness, by the way, you are that person.\n\n138\n00:07:35.397 --> 00:07:38.810\n[LAUGH] But you get that situation where.\n\n139\n00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.350\n>> Wait a second.\n[LAUGH]\n\n140\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.900\n>> What?\n\n141\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.668\nI'm just saying.\n\n142\n00:07:41.668 --> 00:07:44.320\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n143\n00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.597\n>> Do I have a laser dot in the back of my\n\n144\n00:07:46.597 --> 00:07:47.706\nhead right now?\n\n145\n00:07:47.706 --> 00:07:50.484\n>> Yeah [LAUGH] right.\n>> But you get that situation where,\n\n146\n00:07:50.484 --> 00:07:54.624\nlike with police departments,\nyou had an officer or\n\n147\n00:07:54.624 --> 00:07:57.822\nsomething that did something dumb, And\n\n148\n00:07:57.822 --> 00:08:02.714\nthey're the ones that are being\nheld responsible for it, but\n\n149\n00:08:02.714 --> 00:08:08.670\nguess what all the other officers and\nthe whole community has to deal with.\n\n150\n00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.150\nThey have to deal with, this guy did\nsomething dumb so they're all like that.\n\n151\n00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.065\nThat same thing can\nhappen with a business.\n\n152\n00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:17.700\n>> Yeah, people forget that if\nyou've got your Facebook page or\n\n153\n00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.770\nwhatever type of media page there and\nthat very top it says about you and\n\n154\n00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.330\nabout who you work for so\n>> anything that you put on there could\n\n155\n00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.480\ndefinitely be construed as you are now a\npublic representation of your company and\n\n156\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.345\npeople forget that.\n\n157\n00:08:30.345 --> 00:08:32.600\nOther things I see are,\n\n158\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.470\npeople might be friends with a coworker\non somebody's social media, and\n\n159\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.640\nthey talk about work related stuff, stuff\nthat shouldn't be publicly available.\n\n160\n00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.970\nIf their settings aren't exactly right or\nif somebody messes with their account,\n\n161\n00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.740\nit's very easy to expose\ninformation that way.\n\n162\n00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.560\nThey're not think about it.\n\n163\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.740\nThey think, Oh, I'm just gonna\nshoot John a quick Instagram or\n\n164\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.520\na post on Facebook and\nput some account information in there,\n\n165\n00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.945\nnot thinking that the rest of\nthe world might end up seeing that.\n\n166\n00:08:57.945 --> 00:08:58.491\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n167\n00:08:58.491 --> 00:09:00.400\nthat's what you're\ntalking about leaking out\n\n168\n00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.470\n>> sensitive information,\n\n169\n00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.140\ncompany information and\nyou see it all over the place now where\n\n170\n00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.370\npeople are feeling the repercussions of\nwhat they posted on Facebook at their job.\n\n171\n00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.910\nEmployers now search your social\nmedia pages looking at your page and\n\n172\n00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.210\nlooking what you have on there\nbefore they even hire you,\n\n173\n00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.980\ncuz they're not gonna hire you if\nyou've got pictures of you doing\n\n174\n00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.660\nthings that don't fall in line\nwith the company standards.\n\n175\n00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.490\n>> Exactly.\n\n176\n00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.273\nI'm never getting hired by.\n\n177\n00:09:27.273 --> 00:09:29.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Let's write a note here.\n\n178\n00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.460\nThat's definitely true.\n\n179\n00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.700\nIn fact, that's an interesting thing right\nthere, that you're bringing that up.\n\n180\n00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.720\nIs regardless of what's on someone's\nFacebook page, let's just say they've\n\n181\n00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.690\ngot something on their Facebook page and\nthe employer wants to take a look at that.\n\n182\n00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:48.410\nOne of the things that's actually come\ninto play is employers have said, Well,\n\n183\n00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.190\nwe are worried what these\npeople are posting.\n\n184\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.500\nWhen we hire them We want to\nfind out who that individual is.\n\n185\n00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.800\nOne of the things is that\nsince social media is so new,\n\n186\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.590\nhow do you deal with that?\n\n187\n00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:04.400\nSo one of the things they had for a while\ngoing on was employers were saying,\n\n188\n00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.380\nWell, you need to give us your username\nand password so we can log into your\n\n189\n00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.610\naccount and take a look to see what\ntype of shenanigans you may be up to.\n\n190\n00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.040\nAnd the thing is that according to\n\n191\n00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.130\nthe user agreement that you have\nwith Facebook, you can't do that.\n\n192\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.430\nThey can't coerce you to do that.\n\n193\n00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.940\nFacebook had to come in themselves and\nsay, That's against what we do.\n\n194\n00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.330\nYou cannot do that.\n\n195\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.190\n>> If we find people are doing that,\nwe'll take legal action against you for\n\n196\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.060\nforcing someone to do that.\n\n197\n00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.165\nNot the individual,\nyou coerced them into doing that.\n\n198\n00:10:33.165 --> 00:10:36.380\nSo some businesses came up with\na sneaky way of doing this.\n\n199\n00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.520\nYou login and\nthen we'll see what you got in there.\n\n200\n00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.970\nAnd they're not really\nallowed to do that either so\n\n201\n00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.810\nthat's been something that's\nbeen very challenging.\n\n202\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.740\nThe business wants to know, but what do\nthey actually have a right to really know\n\n203\n00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.950\nand how can they find\nthat type of stuff out?\n\n204\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.400\nDon's got one Facebook friend but\nwouldn't elaborate who it is.\n\n205\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.190\nI know who it is people.\n\n206\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.620\nI'll tell them, I don't care who it is.\n\n207\n00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.255\nIt's Tom from My Space.\n\n208\n00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:04.410\n[LAUGH] I always wondered about that dude.\n\n209\n00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.570\nWhat happened to that dude\nwith that My Space in there?\n\n210\n00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.870\nAnd you can tell I always like\nthat picture he's got and\n\n211\n00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.000\nhe's always like this.\n\n212\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.105\nYou can't turn around for\nfive seconds to take a picture?\n\n213\n00:11:15.105 --> 00:11:17.815\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Busy, Tom, doing my stuff.\n\n214\n00:11:17.815 --> 00:11:22.530\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] With the sharing\n\n215\n00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:27.310\nof data it's just too easy and\nit's not protected.\n\n216\n00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.870\nAnother thing that comes to mind, Sean, is\nhow do I know that's really that person on\n\n217\n00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.590\nthe other end when I'm\nworking with social media and\n\n218\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:40.720\nnot somebody that's faking one of my\ncoworkers or something like that?\n\n219\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.370\n>> People get fooled by\nthat one all the time and\n\n220\n00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.130\nit's not even just a coworker,\n>> probably,\n\n221\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.820\nI would say it's reasonably safe to say\nthat most people know somebody that's\n\n222\n00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.980\ngotten fooled by someone on one\nof these social media platforms.\n\n223\n00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:59.644\nEither directly got fooled by them or\njust thought, Heck,\n\n224\n00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:06.110\nthat was the real person involved\ncelebrity or something else.\n\n225\n00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:10.660\nI had a friend years ago when social\nmedia was still in its infancy.\n\n226\n00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.979\nHe was, Hey,\nAdriana Lima just sent me an email.\n\n227\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.390\nIf you don't know who that is,\nit's a Victoria's Secret model.\n\n228\n00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:25.907\nI'm sure we just lost half the people\nare going to Google it right now.\n\n229\n00:12:25.907 --> 00:12:28.095\nBut there's no way, I was telling them,\n\n230\n00:12:28.095 --> 00:12:33.020\ndo you know the probability of\nthat being her is like miniscule?\n\n231\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.320\nDoubt it would be that easy for\nher to find her on there and\n\n232\n00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.020\nget her email address.\n\n233\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.050\nYou know, can you imagine?\n\n234\n00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.320\nAt the time, a model.\n\n235\n00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.410\nSure, whatever.\n\n236\n00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.490\nYou know, but\npeople were still new to that.\n\n237\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.680\nThey believe that the person in their side\nof that, they claim to be that person,\n\n238\n00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.130\nthey are that person.\n\n239\n00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.830\nThat has kind of calmed down a bit,\nbut you still see it.\n\n240\n00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.560\nThat people go on social media and\n\n241\n00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.000\nsee a page on there and\nthink that's the actual celebrity.\n\n242\n00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.568\nIt's not.\n\n243\n00:13:00.568 --> 00:13:03.900\nIt's someone posting, grabbing a picture,\nand it's easy enough to do,\n\n244\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.270\ngrab a picture, post it on there,\njust hide your email address.\n\n245\n00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:11.060\nYou can act like that person all you want.\n\n246\n00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.315\nAnd even though you’re\nnot allowed to do that,\n\n247\n00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:17.040\nyou can do that, you can get away\nwith it for a pretty long time.\n\n248\n00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.770\nAnd people probably aren’t\ngonna say anything,\n\n249\n00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.010\nespecially if they got\nfooled by something.\n\n250\n00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.580\nSo it’s easy to do that.\n\n251\n00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.510\nIt’s very,\nvery easy to do that sort of stuff.\n\n252\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:30.490\nSo faking an actual coworker could\nbe just as easy to do if not\n\n253\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.820\neasier because it's,\nreally tough to tough to verify.\n\n254\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.770\nAnd in my friend's case, I could say,\nWell, yeah, that's probably not you know,\n\n255\n00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:43.580\nI have a really high degree of confidence\nin making the assertion that that's not\n\n256\n00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.258\nAdriana Lima contacting you,\nI'm pretty sure.\n\n257\n00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:49.360\nI can say pretty high degree\nof probability there, but\n\n258\n00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.340\nif it's John Doe from wherever,\nhow the heck do I know that?\n\n259\n00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.270\nI could do stuff to find out,\nbut it's a lot more work, so\n\n260\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:03.070\nit's tough to do stuff like that to\nkind of detect some of that stuff.\n\n261\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.060\nPeople still have a lot of\nissues where they trust.\n\n262\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.120\nSomeone claims to be that person,\nthey are.\n\n263\n00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.370\nYou gotta be that other\nside that trusts no one.\n\n264\n00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.720\nThat X-Files type stuff.\n\n265\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.920\nBe paranoid [LAUGH] a little\nto a certain degree.\n\n266\n00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.395\n>> So what do we do about it?\n\n267\n00:14:16.395 --> 00:14:21.075\nHow do we fix it or prevent it or\nat least mitigate some of it?\n\n268\n00:14:21.075 --> 00:14:24.245\nA good amount of it is that\nsecurity awareness training.\n\n269\n00:14:24.245 --> 00:14:27.395\nWe had discussed some of\nthat in previous episodes.\n\n270\n00:14:27.395 --> 00:14:32.492\nDoing security awareness training letting\npeople know it's a trust, but verify.\n\n271\n00:14:33.492 --> 00:14:36.322\nBe cautious with it.\n\n272\n00:14:36.322 --> 00:14:41.232\nWhen you see something happen online,\neither that or someone claims do it as far\n\n273\n00:14:41.232 --> 00:14:46.712\nas the social media stuff, most of\nthat's just purely an educational issue.\n\n274\n00:14:46.712 --> 00:14:49.710\nYes, there are things that\n\n275\n00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.950\nthe technology itself causes that's\nnot someone themselves doing it.\n\n276\n00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.060\nYou could argue, for\nexample, with Facebook.\n\n277\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.890\nFacebook's changed its privacy\nsettings numerous times and\n\n278\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.000\nit's a joke, the way they've done,\nbecause they did it several times.\n\n279\n00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.950\nThey haven't done any big changes\nrecently, but because they did several big\n\n280\n00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.530\nchanges in a row and didn't tell anybody\ntill after the fact, they're like, Oh,\n\n281\n00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:11.430\nit makes it easier on you.\n\n282\n00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:12.350\nIt's like, no, it doesn't.\n\n283\n00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.190\nYou just messed up a whole bunch of stuff.\n\n284\n00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:20.760\nWhy do you keep making these\nhuge changes like that?\n\n285\n00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.110\nSo it's not the technology failing,\nnecessarily.\n\n286\n00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.410\nIt's the people owning the technology on\nthat side saying, Hey, we're gonna change\n\n287\n00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.640\nstuff, and then they don't inform us\nthe right way or make us aware of it.\n\n288\n00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.210\nSo that causes a problem too that we\ncan't be directly educated on it by\n\n289\n00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.730\nour employers, or do it ourselves.\n\n290\n00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:37.660\nAll off a sudden it's done,\n\n291\n00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.895\nwe're scrambling after the fact\nto pick up the pieces.\n\n292\n00:15:41.895 --> 00:15:46.665\nYou have that and\nthat's just the information sharing part.\n\n293\n00:15:46.665 --> 00:15:49.703\nThe raw information, pictures,\ntext, stuff like that.\n\n294\n00:15:49.703 --> 00:15:53.341\nThe thing we haven't talked\nabout with this new media, and\n\n295\n00:15:53.341 --> 00:15:56.634\nit fits into the social aspect\nof it is sharing files.\n\n296\n00:15:56.634 --> 00:16:00.059\nThat's something else that cloud\ntechnologies do fit in here too.\n\n297\n00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.441\nThey kind of rear their head.\n\n298\n00:16:01.441 --> 00:16:04.759\nWhen people are sharing\nstuff over those things,\n\n299\n00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:09.280\nwhether or not the stuff we typically\nassociate with social media.\n\n300\n00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.090\nThey come in this category because\nthey can share it out to friends and\n\n301\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.240\nwhoever and some of the stuff is\nalready done behind their back, too.\n\n302\n00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.980\nI mean,\nyou look at stuff like with Google.\n\n303\n00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:23.990\nIf you've got an Android device or\nyou have something like\n\n304\n00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.930\nDropbox installed on there, OneDrive,\nit will sync a lot of stuff automatically.\n\n305\n00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.680\nSome of that stuff you\ndon't have to do anything.\n\n306\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.360\nAs soon as you set the device and\npunch a couple things in, it's doing that.\n\n307\n00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.290\nEverything's checked by default,\nit's going to sync it.\n\n308\n00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.170\nSo next thing you know,\nyour stuff's up there.\n\n309\n00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:41.400\nAre you sure that if your stuff is with\nyour Google account when it syncs up to\n\n310\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.050\ntheir servers, are you sure it's secured\nand not just open to the big wide world?\n\n311\n00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.590\nYou know have you ever checked it,\nare you 100% sure?\n\n312\n00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.337\nWell, some of these people\nare checking right now.\n\n313\n00:16:52.337 --> 00:16:56.401\n>> [LAUGH] I agree,\nwhen I clicked on I clicked, you know.\n\n314\n00:16:56.401 --> 00:17:01.087\n>> Yeah, you don't really know\nin a lot of these cases if\n\n315\n00:17:01.087 --> 00:17:04.017\nyou're actually secure or not.\n\n316\n00:17:04.017 --> 00:17:07.569\nYou just know it's putting it up there,\nso it's available everywhere.\n\n317\n00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:13.095\nOkay, it's available everywhere,\nbut what's the scope of that share?\n\n318\n00:17:13.095 --> 00:17:15.928\nIs it just to me or\nis it everyone can see it?\n\n319\n00:17:15.928 --> 00:17:20.672\nYou know, they've gotten better about\nthat, but you can't take it as 100%\n\n320\n00:17:20.672 --> 00:17:25.279\nthat it's absolutely secure when you\nstart factoring in stuff like outside of\n\n321\n00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:29.490\none drive and Dropbox, there's a lot\nservices out there for sharing.\n\n322\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:34.790\nThrowing something else into it is,\njust ask yourself how many services\n\n323\n00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:40.140\nyou may have joined over\nthe years since shoving stuff\n\n324\n00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:47.440\nup in the Cloud was something that came\ninto being or became popular to do.\n\n325\n00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.460\nHow many places have you gone through and\nsaved stuff out in the Cloud someplace and\n\n326\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.030\nthen moved to other service and\nforgot about it?\n\n327\n00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.522\nI'm pretty sure there's a large amount\nof people that have put something,\n\n328\n00:17:57.522 --> 00:18:01.390\nsome place on there, and been like,\noh I'm going to consolidate it over here.\n\n329\n00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.640\nMaybe you decide at some point, I'm going\nto consolidate everything on one drive,\n\n330\n00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.410\nbecause it makes more sense for you to\ndo that because you can integrate or\n\n331\n00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.900\ndo all sorts of integration,\nyou know tricks with it, and\n\n332\n00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.720\nshare that a lot easier\nto people you want.\n\n333\n00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.680\nThere's benefits to that, but\nwhat about all the stuff you pulled off\n\n334\n00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.800\nthe other services and\ndownloaded it and put it on one drive?\n\n335\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.800\nDid you erase all the copies and\neradicate all the stuff off there or\n\n336\n00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.210\ndid you just say, okay I'm not using\nany more, I won't log in any more?\n\n337\n00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.690\nYeah, those are things to think of and\nsome people,\n\n338\n00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:33.540\nheck, even with the stuff like I've\nseen this done on Google drive a lot.\n\n339\n00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.430\nIn fact, I've got somebody I\nknow who shall remain nameless,\n\n340\n00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:42.740\nnot that it would matter anyway,\nI have someone that I worked with on\n\n341\n00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.290\na project about five years ago now, and\n\n342\n00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:52.730\nthey were saving the documents up\nin the Google Drive technology,\n\n343\n00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.610\nthey save it up there,\nthey forgot about it.\n\n344\n00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.000\nI can still see those documents today.\n\n345\n00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.460\nI don't even talk to that person anymore.\n\n346\n00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.070\nIt's been four and\na half years since I've talked to them.\n\n347\n00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.710\nTheir documents are still there, and\nthose documents are things that they've\n\n348\n00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.150\ngot shared out to multiple people\nthat worked on that project, and\n\n349\n00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:15.700\nit's got business information\nas of that point in time,\n\n350\n00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:20.010\ncontract information, stuff like that,\nstuff that at the time was under NDA,\n\n351\n00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.700\nbut now after that amount of years and\nthey've kind of abandoned it, it's open.\n\n352\n00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.430\nWe're not under NDA anymore,\nnone of us are.\n\n353\n00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:31.030\nIt's just there open, and\nthey forgot about it.\n\n354\n00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.270\nSo it may be a little old, but\nyou can still do damage with it.\n\n355\n00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.820\nHow many times have you done\nthat in your own stuff,\n\n356\n00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.022\nshared something out and forgot about it.\n\n357\n00:19:38.022 --> 00:19:39.590\n>> All right.\n\n358\n00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:44.075\nYeah so teaching our users how to handle\nsocial media, what's expected of them,\n\n359\n00:19:44.075 --> 00:19:47.000\nas far as I don't know what\nthey're allowed to post or\n\n360\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.397\nwhat their not allowed to talk about,\nthings like that help.\n\n361\n00:19:50.397 --> 00:19:55.008\n>> Yeah, you definitely have to have some\nsort of training that tells them and\n\n362\n00:19:55.008 --> 00:19:59.469\nin the the case of the general social\nmedia, is telling them what types of\n\n363\n00:19:59.469 --> 00:20:04.300\nthings they should really think about and\nevaluate when they're doing this,\n\n364\n00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.468\nand that's kind of tricky because\nif you get too specific about it,\n\n365\n00:20:08.468 --> 00:20:11.070\na lot of people get kind of tunnel vision.\n\n366\n00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.200\nIt's like oh, you said this stuff,\nyou didn't say this other stuff.\n\n367\n00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:18.470\nIt's like hey, use the brain you\nwere born with and think about that.\n\n368\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.970\nI gave you examples and\n\n369\n00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.810\nit wasn't all inclusive, some people\njust kind of focused directly on it.\n\n370\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:28.480\nOne of the things I say is I'll give some\nexamples, but then I'll follow it up with\n\n371\n00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.430\nsaying if it's not something you\ntalk about in a crowded room, or\n\n372\n00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:37.310\nshare with just anybody in general,\nthen it's probably something that you're\n\n373\n00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:40.286\nwilling to evaluate if it needs to be\nput up there in the first place or\n\n374\n00:20:40.286 --> 00:20:44.420\nif it needs to be put up there,\nhow you're really going to control that.\n\n375\n00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.120\nIf you're not comfortable with saying\nI'm going to go in a crowded room and\n\n376\n00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:53.540\ntalk about whatever,\nthen don't put it up there.\n\n377\n00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:58.300\nYou definitely have an issue with it,\nso really, really think about it.\n\n378\n00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:03.730\nThat represents a big change for us and\na change in the user's behaviour,\n\n379\n00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:11.170\nbecause if you think about it, when I was\ngrowing up, you had those issues where\n\n380\n00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:18.310\nthe thinking was that we really\ndidn't talk about stuff too much.\n\n381\n00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:22.617\nIt was not that we were being private,\njust the fact of the matter was,\n\n382\n00:21:22.617 --> 00:21:26.271\nwe were a lot more private with stuff,\nwe were used to that.\n\n383\n00:21:26.271 --> 00:21:29.793\nBut we saw over the last 20\nyears this big paradigm shift,\n\n384\n00:21:29.793 --> 00:21:34.867\nthis shift in thinking where people wanna\nbe more open, with the Internet saying oh,\n\n385\n00:21:34.867 --> 00:21:39.656\nit's a smaller world, and you can share\ninformation easier, and it's a global\n\n386\n00:21:39.656 --> 00:21:44.266\ncommunity and all that, and I can talk\nto people over here, here, and here.\n\n387\n00:21:44.266 --> 00:21:46.751\nPeople really embrace that.\n\n388\n00:21:46.751 --> 00:21:51.317\nI even partially joke around with it, and\nI think there's something to do with, I\n\n389\n00:21:51.317 --> 00:21:55.882\nsay that reality TV probably had something\nto do with it too because everyone wants\n\n390\n00:21:55.882 --> 00:22:00.314\nto be a star and thinks it's okay to share\nwhatever, put their dirt or laundry or\n\n391\n00:22:00.314 --> 00:22:04.217\nwhatever on TV, and they're used to\nseeing it in other areas so heck,\n\n392\n00:22:04.217 --> 00:22:06.760\neveryone knows everything about everyone.\n\n393\n00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.690\nThere's no privacy anymore.\n\n394\n00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.800\nI hear people say that,\noh there's no privacy any more,\n\n395\n00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.070\nso they're just gonna assume that that's\nthe way it is, and they're going to\n\n396\n00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.590\nthrow the baby out with the bathwater and\nsay, that's the way it is,\n\n397\n00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.340\nI'm not going to bother or,\nI don't have anything important.\n\n398\n00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.890\nWell, you may think you don't, but I may\n\n399\n00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.800\nhave a different opinion on that when I\nget to see the stuff that you're sharing.\n\n400\n00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.490\nSo it's a big change in behaviour, and\nwe've had to adapt to that as businesses.\n\n401\n00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:34.840\nI like that one that David put out there,\nthe article, if you think about this one,\n\n402\n00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.980\nit's actually kind of funny, there is\nan article on Google Drive Fishing,\n\n403\n00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:38.860\nI've got the link.\n\n404\n00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.862\nHe is talking about fishing in there,\n\n405\n00:22:40.862 --> 00:22:44.628\nhe sends us a link like I am going to\nclick on that after you talk about it.\n\n406\n00:22:44.628 --> 00:22:48.877\n[LAUGH] So, just saying no offense.\n\n407\n00:22:48.877 --> 00:22:52.243\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n408\n00:22:52.243 --> 00:22:56.309\nWell, Sean, a lot of a great information\non the impact of social media and\n\n409\n00:22:56.309 --> 00:23:00.718\nwhat it's doing to our design and\nplanning of our enterprise infrastructure.\n\n410\n00:23:00.718 --> 00:23:03.969\nSo anything else we need to toss in\nhere before we wrap this one up?\n\n411\n00:23:03.969 --> 00:23:07.084\n>> Not to be over dramatic, but\nour social media's responsible for\n\n412\n00:23:07.084 --> 00:23:08.961\nthe decline of Western civilization.\n\n413\n00:23:08.961 --> 00:23:10.704\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] No,\n\n414\n00:23:10.704 --> 00:23:13.187\njust to take social media seriously,\n\n415\n00:23:13.187 --> 00:23:18.318\nit's something that you can't put\nthe genie back in the bottle, you can't.\n\n416\n00:23:18.318 --> 00:23:23.804\nIt's out there, you can't tell people\ndon't use it because either they're going\n\n417\n00:23:23.804 --> 00:23:29.301\nto use it or they're not, and you having a\nsay on it probably isn't going to matter.\n\n418\n00:23:29.301 --> 00:23:33.617\nThey're gonna to do whatever and\nprobably most people nowadays,\n\n419\n00:23:33.617 --> 00:23:37.005\nif they don't come from the very,\nvery old school,\n\n420\n00:23:37.005 --> 00:23:40.794\nthey may kind of be well,\nI'm not going to use this stuff.\n\n421\n00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:44.356\nYou still hear people say,\nI don't have Facebook accounts, but\n\n422\n00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:48.566\na lot of them eventually do, when they\nstart seeing people migrating over and\n\n423\n00:23:48.566 --> 00:23:52.513\ndoing more stuff with it, and the stuff\nthat they hear on TV and all that,\n\n424\n00:23:52.513 --> 00:23:56.789\nthey just start putting their toes in\nthere and treading lightly and then start\n\n425\n00:23:56.789 --> 00:24:01.436\ngoing deeper and deeper into it, and\neventually, they're swimming in the ocean.\n\n426\n00:24:01.436 --> 00:24:03.867\nThat's the way it works, so\n\n427\n00:24:03.867 --> 00:24:08.640\nyou're not going to be able\nto tell people not to use it.\n\n428\n00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.920\nIf they're going to use it\nthey're going to use it,\n\n429\n00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.910\nyou don't really have any say so\nwhatsoever.\n\n430\n00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.460\nWhat you have to do is\n\n431\n00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.990\nget them more educated on types of\nthings that are appropriate to share, or\n\n432\n00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:23.130\nat least implications of\ndoing these sorts of things.\n\n433\n00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:27.640\nI mean, the amount of stuff, the types\nof things that people share, some of\n\n434\n00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.690\nthis stuff you just wonder if these people\ncame out of the factory without a brain or\n\n435\n00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.269\ndid they lose it somewhere along the way?\n\n436\n00:24:34.565 --> 00:24:42.170\nWhen we talk about social media,\nthere was a case that they put on line,\n\n437\n00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:46.830\nthat they busted a bunch of drug\ndealer ring, and the way they did it,\n\n438\n00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:51.430\nwhere people were selling marijuana and\nmeth and stuff like that.\n\n439\n00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:54.490\nThey were selling it and\nthe way they were showing their products,\n\n440\n00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.570\nthey had a Facebook page for it.\n\n441\n00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.720\nThe police were just sitting there, they\njust went right through the list on it and\n\n442\n00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:05.350\nwhat they couldn't get, they sent\na request out on behalf of the courts\n\n443\n00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.720\ndirectly out to Facebook and said yeah,\n\n444\n00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.560\nwe need a list of all the members in\nthere and their information from that.\n\n445\n00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.670\nThey just went through it and\nrounded them up.\n\n446\n00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:17.670\nPeople were taking pictures of their\ntupperware containers full of whatever.\n\n447\n00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.057\nHey, look, it's for sale!\n\n448\n00:25:19.057 --> 00:25:22.399\nIt's like a summer sale or\nsomething like that, or whatever,\n\n449\n00:25:22.399 --> 00:25:25.160\nthey were doing this type of stuff.\n\n450\n00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:29.608\nIt's like, they lost their darn minds.\n\n451\n00:25:29.608 --> 00:25:35.150\nSo it's a known evil, but\njust be prepared to deal with it.\n\n452\n00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.610\nIf you're not really sure how\ndangerous it is at this point,\n\n453\n00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.452\ngo look at our reconnaissance section\nof our ethical hacking course.\n\n454\n00:25:42.452 --> 00:25:48.070\nI mean, a lot of you were in that, so\nyou know about the echo set technology.\n\n455\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.260\nThat's probably the number one way\n\n456\n00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.050\nto show somebody that doesn't know the\nimplications of over sharing stuff, that's\n\n457\n00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.476\nprobably the number one way to show them,\nyeah look what you're sharing, probably,\n\n458\n00:25:57.476 --> 00:25:59.980\ntheir heart will go up into the throat,\nand they'll really think about stuff.\n\n459\n00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.180\nI was like I had no idea, like,\nremember the reaction Weston had?\n\n460\n00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.920\nI think we could of just stopped for\nlike half hour, hour, and done whatever,\n\n461\n00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.010\nwhile people were just like woah, woah,\nwoah, I got some stuff to do here.\n\n462\n00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.062\nThat's the reaction,\na lot of times you can just show people,\n\n463\n00:26:13.062 --> 00:26:15.710\nit's like okay I'm not going\nto tell you how bad it is,\n\n464\n00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.623\nlet me show you how bad it is, and then\nthey're like oh, okay, I need to stop, so\n\n465\n00:26:19.623 --> 00:26:21.948\nI need to stop doing this stuff,\nhold my calls.\n\n466\n00:26:21.948 --> 00:26:25.385\n>> All right, well ladies and gentleman,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n467\n00:26:25.385 --> 00:26:27.753\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n468\n00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:28.844\n>> And I'm Shawn Rellano.\n\n469\n00:26:28.844 --> 00:26:30.191\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n470\n00:26:30.191 -->

and\n\n3\n00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:15.920\nwith me today is Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.880\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.710\n>> Doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.490\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.070\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.820\nWe've got another one of our\nexciting CompTIA advanced security\n\n9\n00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.950\npractitioner episodes coming your way.\n\n10\n00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.430\nThis one we're going to talk about\nglobal information awareness.\n\n11\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.730\nSean, the title kind of says it all.\n\n12\n00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.680\nWe're all coming together, I guess.\n\n13\n00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.270\n>> Yeah that's what it is.\n\n14\n00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.510\nIt sounds kind of nice.\n\n15\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.180\nWe're all coming together\nto solve a problem.\n\n16\n00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.310\n>> Share a drink and a smile.\n\n17\n00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.230\nThere's a collective security threat,\nand the world's coming together.\n\n18\n00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.866\nI think that's the power of the Watchmen,\nbut I'm not sure.\n\n19\n00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:53.630\n[LAUGH]\nSo yeah,\n\n20\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.640\nthat's what we're really talking about\nhere is, you don't just work in a vacuum.\n\n21\n00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.820\nYou work in a situation\nwhere you have a lot of\n\n22\n00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.560\nresources to call upon or network with to\n\n23\n00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.890\nshare information wherever appropriate\nof course, share that information.\n\n24\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.470\nAnd you know hopefully that will expose\nyou to new viewpoints, new technologies,\n\n25\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.320\nnew techniques other people are using,\nand kind of get a better idea and\n\n26\n00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.630\nhopefully be better informed\nof how to solve Issues.\n\n27\n00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.740\nYou can't really underestimate\njust how valuable this could be.\n\n28\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.770\nAnd I know we've mentioned some of these\ngroups before in other courses that\n\n29\n00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.055\nwe've done, but there's an endless amount\nof groups out there in alphabets soup,\n\n30\n00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:46.615\nkind of fitting with that,\n\n31\n00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:50.495\nthat you can call upon to get some really,\nreally good information.\n\n32\n00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:53.405\nThat's what we're really\ntrying to look at.\n\n33\n00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:54.560\n>> Okay.\nYeah, where do we even start?\n\n34\n00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.741\nHow do we know where to go to\nlook at one of these groups?\n\n35\n00:01:57.741 --> 00:02:03.558\nWell that's probably going to\nbe the most difficult thing,\n\n36\n00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:09.410\nbut it's not difficult in a really,\nreally nasty sense.\n\n37\n00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.000\nIt just means that relative to\neverything else we've done,\n\n38\n00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.910\nit's just finding the ones that are either\nappropriate to you if they exist, and man,\n\n39\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.190\npeople will create groups for anything.\n\n40\n00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.260\n>> Facebook groups is what\nwe're talking about, right?\n\n41\n00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.135\n>> Yeah, Facebook groups.\n\n42\n00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:28.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can group them,\n\n43\n00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.720\nthey have a public fair.\n\n44\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.110\nBut you'll see a lot of\nthese groups out there.\n\n45\n00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.200\nSome of them you can find really easily.\n\n46\n00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.140\nSome of them you may have\nto dig just a little bit.\n\n47\n00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.380\nBut they have groups for everything.\n\n48\n00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.300\nThey have people that have\npooled their resources for\n\n49\n00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.300\njust about anything you can imagine.\n\n50\n00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.960\nFor what we're talking about for\nIT, there's lots of them out there.\n\n51\n00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.070\nWe have ones like, I'll just say security.\n\n52\n00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.515\nJump right over to that.\n\n53\n00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.415\nSANS is one of the big ones out there.\n\n54\n00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:10.395\nSANS does conferences,\nthey've got all sorts of conferences,\n\n55\n00:03:10.395 --> 00:03:15.305\nand groups that meet at those conferences\nthat talk about security issues.\n\n56\n00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:19.606\nYou can take training, you can listen\nto presenters, they've got podcasts,\n\n57\n00:03:19.606 --> 00:03:24.510\nthey've got all sort of things\nhappening just at their\n\n58\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.660\nstuff if you want to\nbecome part of that deal.\n\n59\n00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.270\nSo that would be just one.\n\n60\n00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.200\nYeah, there's ones for IT too.\n\n61\n00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.530\nIT is one of the ones that's pretty\nwell covered as far as groups go,\n\n62\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.200\nif you're just looking\non that side of things.\n\n63\n00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.110\nIT, there's all sorts of computer\nuser groups, and just about any city\n\n64\n00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.500\nyou go to has some sort of computer user\ngroup and they have different levels.\n\n65\n00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.290\nI know a place where I used to live\nthey had a big computer user group,\n\n66\n00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.180\nbut that computer user group had different\nproficiency levels throughout it.\n\n67\n00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.970\nIt had the very basic ones that would\nbe meet and learn what a computer was,\n\n68\n00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.460\nall the way up to one that were talking\nabout the more advanced issues.\n\n69\n00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.760\nThat could be something that you could\ncall upon just for that sense of things.\n\n70\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.150\nAnd there's Windows user groups and\nMicrosoft's got their conferences that you\n\n71\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.350\ncan go to if you're into\nthat sort of thing, so\n\n72\n00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.060\nyou've got that out there, but\nto go more in the security side,\n\n73\n00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.490\nthey've got security manager\ngroups where people meet for that.\n\n74\n00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.060\nIn fact you can go to some of the bigger\nconferences, and you can find groups for\n\n75\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.720\njust about any conference relating to\nsecurity where the managers actually meet\n\n76\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.520\nand talk about their specific issues.\n\n77\n00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.470\nThey're not talking about\nin the trenches stuff,\n\n78\n00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.040\nhow to secure a certain resource or\nthat, even though that may peek out.\n\n79\n00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.990\nThey're talking about what types\nof new techniques are out there.\n\n80\n00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.130\nThey may be listening to a speaker\ntalk about new techniques and\n\n81\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.780\ndevelopments, and\nto make their lives easier.\n\n82\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.305\nI would definitely encourage you to\nbe apart of something like that,\n\n83\n00:04:57.305 --> 00:05:00.195\nbecause you can't know everything,\nbut you can\n\n84\n00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:04.935\nget together with like-minded individuals\nor people that are experienced in those.\n\n85\n00:05:04.935 --> 00:05:08.335\nYou can up your game and\nraise the bar in your skills and\n\n86\n00:05:08.335 --> 00:05:12.325\nlearn new ways to do things,\nas well as learning what\n\n87\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.440\nsomeone else's perspective is,\nand I've said that a few times.\n\n88\n00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.260\nBut don't underestimate that.\n\n89\n00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.920\nYou can very easily work\ninside the walls of a company.\n\n90\n00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.040\nYou're there for awhile, and you can kinda\nget blinders on and everything else.\n\n91\n00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.460\nYou get so involved with what you're\ndoing in that specific system and\n\n92\n00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.920\nenvironment, that you really don't get\ntime to look outside of it too much.\n\n93\n00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.030\nIt's very easy to do that and,\nif you get into that kind of habit.\n\n94\n00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.440\nNow, what happens is that you may not\nbe staying on top of new threats and\n\n95\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.030\nother things that are occurring.\n\n96\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.290\nAs well as stuff that may\nnot have been publicized.\n\n97\n00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.640\nThat's one of the things I find\nvery valuable about these groups,\n\n98\n00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.440\nis that when we do that networking, you'll\nfind people who have encountered stuff\n\n99\n00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.360\nthat may not have ever appeared on paper,\na newsfeed, or anything, anyplace.\n\n100\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.518\nIt's just something that they've\nencountered, and you can talk to them and\n\n101\n00:06:03.518 --> 00:06:08.060\nkind of see how they discovered it,\nhow they dealt with it, stuff that you\n\n102\n00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.970\nwould have to develop entirely on\nyour own if you encountered it.\n\n103\n00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.420\nI have had that experience going to\nsome of these myself, where I've\n\n104\n00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.970\nbeen able to sit next to someone, or just\nby accident ran into someone, or you know,\n\n105\n00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.980\nwas sitting in a presentation, heard some\nnew type of information that wasn't in any\n\n106\n00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:35.190\npublished in any place, or really that\nspecific incident relates to something.\n\n107\n00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.980\nTremendously helpful, and can get you\nout of some really sticky situations.\n\n108\n00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.380\nSo very, very important.\n\n109\n00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.130\nSo we mentioned that there's SANS.\n\n110\n00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.790\nThere's also, we said Microsoft's got\nsome stuff like that, but that's more for\n\n111\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.030\ngeneral IT.\n\n112\n00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.740\nYou've got InfraGard here in the states.\n\n113\n00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.120\nInfraGard is something the FBI sponsors.\n\n114\n00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:03.790\nWhat the FBI does, is the FBI has these\ngroups all over the US that you can join.\n\n115\n00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.960\nAnd they do just a very cursory\nbackground check on you.\n\n116\n00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.220\nAnd because it's not something they're\ndiscussing classified information.\n\n117\n00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.700\nIt's sensitive,\nit's not anything that's classified.\n\n118\n00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.340\nSo they do enough of\na check to see oh well,\n\n119\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.040\nare you above board who you say you are.\n\n120\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.962\nBut at those things, you can not only\ninteract with people that are in IT, but\n\n121\n00:07:25.962 --> 00:07:30.830\nsecurity as well as a lot of the other\nindustries that you may interact with.\n\n122\n00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.258\nAnd that's something that can be\ntremendously valuable, because it can give\n\n123\n00:07:35.258 --> 00:07:39.549\nyou a big idea or a really good idea of\nwhat's going on in the outside world and\n\n124\n00:07:39.549 --> 00:07:44.110\nhow you fit into them, especially if\nyou're relying on if you're a business and\n\n125\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.006\nyou're relying on utilities, which it's\nkind of hard to imagine where you wouldn't\n\n126\n00:07:49.006 --> 00:07:53.942\nrely on outside public utilities, they can\ntell you the type of stuff they're doing.\n\n127\n00:07:53.942 --> 00:07:57.146\nSo you know what your expectations are.\n\n128\n00:07:57.146 --> 00:08:00.697\nI mean what if you're at a conference and\nyou've got,\n\n129\n00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:05.173\nand you start seeing these utilities\npeople talking about you know,\n\n130\n00:08:05.173 --> 00:08:09.418\nthings that they've done and\nhow they can harden their systems or\n\n131\n00:08:09.418 --> 00:08:14.678\nprotect their systems against being\ndown for prolonged periods of time.\n\n132\n00:08:14.678 --> 00:08:18.030\nWhat if you had cell phone providers\nthat have their people there, and\n\n133\n00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.970\nthey start telling you stuff, improvements\nthey're doing to their systems or\n\n134\n00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.560\nupgrades that had to be delayed.\n\n135\n00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.005\nThat could be something that impacts stuff\nlike your disaster recovery planning.\n\n136\n00:08:29.005 --> 00:08:32.265\nThat could be a direct implication of\nthat, and that many not be something\n\n137\n00:08:32.265 --> 00:08:37.215\nthat you're just gonna hear any place, so\nthat's a very good resource to pull upon.\n\n138\n00:08:37.215 --> 00:08:41.230\nAnd I found, I've been a member\nof Infoguard for a while, for\n\n139\n00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.070\nseveral years now as a matter of fact and\nit's, I've heard\n\n140\n00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.830\na lot of stuff there through the grapevine\nthat I haven't heard in other places.\n\n141\n00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:56.430\nSo we've got an Infoguard that's got,\nthat we got places that things there\n\n142\n00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.583\nthat I've heard through the grapevine and\nI haven't got in other places.\n\n143\n00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:03.910\nSo it's a proven to be a good\nresource over the years to me,\n\n144\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.980\nnetworking with people through\nInfoguard has been very handy.\n\n145\n00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.320\nAnd like I said, they're pretty much\nall over the place in the U.S.,\n\n146\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.750\nthey're in just about every city.\n\n147\n00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.282\nSome of them aren't as active,\n\n148\n00:09:15.282 --> 00:09:19.025\nso sometimes you might wanna look at how\nthe size of the one in your city and say,\n\n149\n00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:22.070\nokay, well you know there's not\nenough happening there yet.\n\n150\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.420\nYou may have to be part of that one, but\n\n151\n00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.720\nyou may find yourself going to one\nin another city that's close by but\n\n152\n00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.010\nI found out that they're pretty handy and\npretty helpful.\n\n153\n00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.010\nAnother one that's really,\nreally nice to go to, and I've been there\n\n154\n00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:42.330\na few times is the High Tech Crime\nInvestigators Association, HTCIA.\n\n155\n00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.851\nThey are one that is, there's a tremendous\namount of value going to them.\n\n156\n00:09:48.851 --> 00:09:53.530\nBecause they, you've got people there\nthat are definitely security focused,\n\n157\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.170\nthey're talking about crime\nscene investigations.\n\n158\n00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.900\nThey're talking about cyber security.\n\n159\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.300\nThey're talking about\na lot of those things.\n\n160\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.460\nAnd, so, you can just go,\nand go to the conference.\n\n161\n00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:09.660\nUsually the conferences are, like,\ntwo or three days I believe.\n\n162\n00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.650\nAnd you get experts there that you\n\n163\n00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.790\nprobably wouldn't get as easy\naccess to in other places.\n\n164\n00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.930\nBut they are, the experts that are there\nusually do some sort of presentation\n\n165\n00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.877\non stuff, or they talk about something\nthat they worked on, or you know,\n\n166\n00:10:23.877 --> 00:10:28.520\ngive you additional insight that\nyou might not get some other place.\n\n167\n00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.247\nHeck, I learned a lot just sitting at,\n\n168\n00:10:31.247 --> 00:10:35.728\ndown to lunch with people there,\namazingly enough, you know.\n\n169\n00:10:35.728 --> 00:10:36.310\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n170\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.300\n>> It acts a big open forum, pretty much.\n\n171\n00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.900\nNo one's doing a presentation, everyone's\njust so busy shoving food in their face,\n\n172\n00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.290\nbut you're gonna run into people there,\nand\n\n173\n00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.560\nwhen you're at lunch, it's more informal.\n\n174\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.210\nAnd you start you know, hearing stuff\nfrom people around the table, and\n\n175\n00:10:55.210 --> 00:11:01.000\nyou get time to really kind of pick up\nsome good tidbits here and make contacts.\n\n176\n00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.110\nI mean, one of the times I went, I had\ntwo guys sitting next to me that were\n\n177\n00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.820\nforensic technicians for\na city in California.\n\n178\n00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.950\nAnd they were telling me some\nof their experiences and\n\n179\n00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.280\nthe challenges they faced for that.\n\n180\n00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.470\ni wouldn't have gotten that\ninformation as easily or\n\n181\n00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:22.150\nin that form, at all,\nat really any place else.\n\n182\n00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:26.568\nI mean these guys were just you know,\ntalking about the stuff that they've done,\n\n183\n00:11:26.568 --> 00:11:29.390\nstuff they trained for, cases they've had.\n\n184\n00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.448\nChallenge that the city's placed on\nthem and the county's placed on them.\n\n185\n00:11:32.448 --> 00:11:35.860\nThere's been a lot of things that\nreally just kind of informal.\n\n186\n00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.240\nThis guy and his partner were\ntalking about all this stuff.\n\n187\n00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.700\nI was like that's pretty cool, I wouldn't\nhave gotten this some place else.\n\n188\n00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.528\nSo that was a really neat one.\n\n189\n00:11:46.528 --> 00:11:51.470\nI would strongly recommend doing that\none if you have one any where near you.\n\n190\n00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.120\nOr you can get the ability\nto travel to go see it.\n\n191\n00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.670\nThey have one in San Diego I believe,\nthey have a conference there in San Diego.\n\n192\n00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.870\nIt's like every September,\nso it's coming up.\n\n193\n00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.180\nThat's one of the ones I went to and\nyeah, I,\n\n194\n00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.410\nthey had the one of the years\nI went to it they had the,\n\n195\n00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.760\nthe lady who does that who, she writes\nbooks on wire shark, Laura, I forget her,\n\n196\n00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.230\nI want to say Chapelle, but\nthat's probably wrong, Chapel, Chapelle?\n\n197\n00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.070\nWhatever.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n198\n00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.500\n>> Yeah, Chapelle and Chapel, yeah,\n\n199\n00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.440\nI made it sound french.\n\n200\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.800\nSo she was there and she does training\n\n201\n00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.350\non wire shark all over the place,\nbut fine, she's just training on it.\n\n202\n00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.460\nShe recognized an expert in the field.\n\n203\n00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.430\nBut she was doing that conference and\n\n204\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.900\nnow she was doing something that\nyou just don't see in other places.\n\n205\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.480\nShe's now doing,\nshe was doing a presentation there and\n\n206\n00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.780\ndoing training on how to use\nwireshark as a forensics tool.\n\n207\n00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.320\nAnd so,\nit's used as network forensics tool.\n\n208\n00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.610\nYeah we know when we we've gone through\nforensics, we know we can do that, but\n\n209\n00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:58.030\nhers was way more in depth than any other\nplace I've ever seen that was doing stuff\n\n210\n00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:02.710\nlike that at the time, you know, so it was\nsomething that you just wouldn't get, and\n\n211\n00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.180\nthat would be very valuable to you.\n\n212\n00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.790\nThey're very valuable to you.\n\n213\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.280\n>> Yeah it really sounds we're kinda going\nright back to what we were talking about\n\n214\n00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.030\nearlier about, it's just so important\nto stay up on top of the latest and\n\n215\n00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.930\nbest information that's out there.\n\n216\n00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.960\nAnd these are just ideal ways to do it.\n\n217\n00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.140\nThis is what these things are geared\ntowards is keeping everybody informed.\n\n218\n00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.980\nGiving everybody a place, a common forum,\nto discuss things that they're dealing\n\n219\n00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.080\nwith or discovering, and\ngetting it out in the open.\n\n220\n00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.760\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n221\n00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.891\nAnd there's other ones that people\nhave mentioned here like NIST and\n\n222\n00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:35.955\nISSA, i s s a.\n\n223\n00:13:35.955 --> 00:13:37.970\nThey're all over the place.\n\n224\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:43.826\nYou know, there's a bunch of ones that\nare out there that you can go to and\n\n225\n00:13:43.826 --> 00:13:45.200\nbe a part of.\n\n226\n00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.760\nNow those are conferences or\ngroups that are doing that.\n\n227\n00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.720\nThey are usually both.\n\n228\n00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.698\nIt's a group that puts on conferences\nwhen you get to that level.\n\n229\n00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:58.900\nBut there's also a communities and\ncommunities are a little different and\n\n230\n00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.060\nyou may think, a couple of\nthe communities that I'll mention here,\n\n231\n00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.440\nyou may think of them as conferences and\nnot so much community,\n\n232\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.280\nbut it's perspective when you go to it.\n\n233\n00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:15.480\nOnes I would think about are Black Hat and\nDEFCON.\n\n234\n00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.700\nThose are Black Hat is what\nDEFCON started as, what?\n\n235\n00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.650\nYesterday or today.\n\n236\n00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.843\nI know it was this week.\n\n237\n00:14:20.843 --> 00:14:24.068\nSo, that I would consider a community.\n\n238\n00:14:24.068 --> 00:14:29.240\nSo what they do, there is presentations\nthere and they do training there.\n\n239\n00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.680\nIt really is a more of a community\ntype of situation because\n\n240\n00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:40.360\npeople go there,\nthey network there all over the place.\n\n241\n00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.515\nThat's what we were\ntalking about yesterday.\n\n242\n00:14:42.515 --> 00:14:44.390\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> If you've never been to one of those\n\n243\n00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:48.910\nevents, those events they do little\nbreakout groups all the time.\n\n244\n00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.400\nThose breakout groups,\nsome of them can be pretty informal.\n\n245\n00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.003\nYou know, these guys will say,\n\n246\n00:14:53.003 --> 00:14:56.475\nwell we're going to meet down at\nthe parking lot next to this car.\n\n247\n00:14:56.475 --> 00:14:59.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we're going to meet there in about\n\n248\n00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:04.880\nhalf an hour, so get something to drink,\ngo use the restroom and meet us out there.\n\n249\n00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.740\nAnd he'll be sitting out there next\nto somebody's Nissan or something,\n\n250\n00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:14.598\nhaving a discussion about something,\njust random about hacking or whatever.\n\n251\n00:15:14.598 --> 00:15:20.290\nAnd so it's, it can be very informal,\nit can be this nice community atmosphere.\n\n252\n00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.620\nAnd people do readily\nshare information there.\n\n253\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.520\nAs long as you're up front and\nstraightforward with everybody about who\n\n254\n00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.580\nyou are and what your intentions are,\nthey're pretty cool with you.\n\n255\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:34.390\nIt's only when you violate the rules\nthat you'll have a lot difficulties\n\n256\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.495\n[LAUGH] from that point forward.\n\n257\n00:15:36.495 --> 00:15:37.525\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n258\n00:15:37.525 --> 00:15:40.748\nthey're pretty above board\nwith everything they do.\n\n259\n00:15:40.748 --> 00:15:44.295\nI've never heard of anybody having\na real negative experience that\n\n260\n00:15:44.295 --> 00:15:48.462\ndidn't really bring it on themselves\nin the first place, so that's something\n\n261\n00:15:48.462 --> 00:15:52.403\nthat you might consider going to because\nit is a very, very good resource.\n\n262\n00:15:52.403 --> 00:15:57.210\nA lot of people do presentations on stuff\nthat Is just not done any place else.\n\n263\n00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.847\nIt's just someones a researcher.\n\n264\n00:15:58.847 --> 00:16:05.360\nThey found something new, and they\nsubmitted a request to do a presentation.\n\n265\n00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.990\nCuz really most people can submit\na request to do a presentation,\n\n266\n00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.110\nif you really wanted to at DEF CON.\n\n267\n00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.490\nI don't know if you guys are aware\nof that out here viewing this.\n\n268\n00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.340\nBut you can submit, if you do it early\nenough, they have open submissions and\n\n269\n00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.460\nyou can say I want to do something like,\nyou wanna present a paper, or\n\n270\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.100\nsome new sort of research and\nthey'll, okay, we got a spot.\n\n271\n00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.610\nYou know, you're not gonna get them at\nlast minute, but you can get those things.\n\n272\n00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.800\nSo if you feel like you're up to snuff,\nand\n\n273\n00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.180\nwanna come try and take on that challenge,\nyou know, go for it, more power to you.\n\n274\n00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.700\nBut, it's a pretty serious environment.\n\n275\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.750\nThe people you are interacting with there,\nthey're no slouches.\n\n276\n00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.590\nThey do know what they're doing.\n\n277\n00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.970\nSo, make sure you have your [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n278\n00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.270\n>> Your game together before\n\n279\n00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.940\nyou go in there.\n\n280\n00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:59.200\nBut, you can find some, just,\ncrazy, crazy stuff happening there.\n\n281\n00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.940\nThat was the event where they were showing\nhow to hack the doors in hotels with just,\n\n282\n00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.720\nyou're using a sharpie that has\na little a few electronics inside,\n\n283\n00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.140\njust to punch in the USB port and\nopen it up.\n\n284\n00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.980\nThey're the ones that, that was where\nit showed up, and how to do that.\n\n285\n00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.590\nAnd so they've done some stuff.\n\n286\n00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:23.490\nI think WEP or WPA was cracked there,\nit was one of their earliest cracks.\n\n287\n00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.606\nWe're done there.\n\n288\n00:17:24.606 --> 00:17:28.328\nThen they do capture the flag stuff when\nyou, I think they even build gadgets and\n\n289\n00:17:28.328 --> 00:17:29.285\nstuff up there too.\n\n290\n00:17:29.285 --> 00:17:29.820\n>> All right.\n\n291\n00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:35.000\n>> Someone built RFID tags,\nthey built a fridge that,\n\n292\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.190\nyou put your beers in there,\nyou put RFID tags on it.\n\n293\n00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.112\nWhen you pull them out,\nyou just put your name on the front of it,\n\n294\n00:17:43.112 --> 00:17:46.770\nso if you have a drinking contest\nwith your buddies, at some point\n\n295\n00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:50.830\nwhen you get deeper in the competition,\nyou're going to have trouble counting.\n\n296\n00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.360\nThey just stuck tags on this stuff,\ncatch them in there.\n\n297\n00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.490\nThey put a little LED\nreadout on the thing,\n\n298\n00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.590\nand you punch in your name, and your\nother friends punch in their name, and\n\n299\n00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.510\nwhen you pull the stuff\nout It knew who you were.\n\n300\n00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.400\n[LAUGH] So it kept track, so your\ndrinking, no longer had to keep track of\n\n301\n00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.060\nthat or who drank the most, so\nthey can pay for the next round.\n\n302\n00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.520\nI don't know, whatever.\n\n303\n00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.270\nSo some oddball stuff happens there,\nso that's not a bad one.\n\n304\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.450\nAnd it really definitely is community,\nas is Black Hat.\n\n305\n00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.790\nThen there's one going back to\nsomething we mentioned yesterday.\n\n306\n00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.970\n2600 magazine, been around for ages.\n\n307\n00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.430\nThey in their magazine,\nwhich you can also get digitally too,\n\n308\n00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:32.385\nin their magazine they have a group\nmeetings all over the place.\n\n309\n00:18:32.385 --> 00:18:35.635\nIf you don't have one in your town,\nyou could start one on your own.\n\n310\n00:18:35.635 --> 00:18:38.945\nBut you usually can find one,\nat least reasonably nearby,\n\n311\n00:18:38.945 --> 00:18:42.635\nand they're usually have\nthese odd meeting places too.\n\n312\n00:18:42.635 --> 00:18:46.282\nIt's stuff that you're kind of,\nwhat type of serious stuff are we doing?\n\n313\n00:18:46.282 --> 00:18:48.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've seen ones that said\n\n314\n00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.320\noh we meet under the escalator at this\ntime, like every second Thursday.\n\n315\n00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:55.440\nUnder the escalator?\n\n316\n00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.230\nI was picturing something like Gollum\nunderneath there doing it something\n\n317\n00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.570\nthe way they worded that.\n\n318\n00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.030\n>> It sounds like I'm gonna\nget rolled when I get there.\n\n319\n00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:01.690\nIt sounds like to me.\n\n320\n00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.810\n>> It's like in a mall or\nsomething like that.\n\n321\n00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.700\nIt's something like that or\nthey meet us at a Starbucks or\n\n322\n00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.840\nsomething some place, and\nthey're all over the world.\n\n323\n00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.520\nThey're all over the world, but people\nthat go to them say, it's neat because\n\n324\n00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:19.850\nsomeone sets stuff up and\nit doesn't take any,\n\n325\n00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:24.700\nit doesn't take any, any special anything\nto be able to host one of those meetings.\n\n326\n00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.976\nAll you got to do is say well I want to,\nI want to have a,\n\n327\n00:19:27.976 --> 00:19:30.230\nI wanna set up a meeting in my town.\n\n328\n00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.850\nAll you got to do is say when you're going\nto meet, and send information to them and\n\n329\n00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.100\nthey're publish the information\nin the magazine, free of charge.\n\n330\n00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:41.960\nBut it's really kind of neat because, the\npeople that have been to those things, and\n\n331\n00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.140\nI've been to them.\n\n332\n00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.060\nThey're really informal.\n\n333\n00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:50.260\nSomeone's meeting at a Starbucks or\nsome place in a mall every whatever.\n\n334\n00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.640\nIt's really casual and\n\n335\n00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:57.020\nyou get like minded people that are just\nhanging out over coffee, or whatever and\n\n336\n00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:02.430\nthey'll just talk about stuff for\na couple hours, and hey that's it.\n\n337\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.892\nIt's another good way to kinda see,\nnot the formal stuff, but\n\n338\n00:20:06.892 --> 00:20:11.560\nsee the stuff that's really grassroots and\npick the brains of like-minded people.\n\n339\n00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.770\nI mean if you're really into the ethical\nhacking stuff like that, and\n\n340\n00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.680\nwant to do your research,\nabsolutely invaluable.\n\n341\n00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.410\nSo that's just a kind of look at some\nof the different options you have.\n\n342\n00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.860\nBut go ahead and do your research and\nfigure out what else.\n\n343\n00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.890\nIf you're in health care,\nthey've got specific healthcare stuff,\n\n344\n00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.640\nthey've got specific finance stuff,\nthey got power generation stuff.\n\n345\n00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.080\nI mean you would have to\nfind these things out.\n\n346\n00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.662\nThese ones I quoted tend to\nbe more generic, except for\n\n347\n00:20:35.662 --> 00:20:39.390\nthe HTCIA, they tend to be pretty generic.\n\n348\n00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.730\nSo if you have something\nfrom a specific industry,\n\n349\n00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.740\nyou're gonna need to do a little\nmore investigation on that.\n\n350\n00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.320\n>> And then sometimes we get new\ncertifications that come out, and\n\n351\n00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.160\nnew training that's available.\n\n352\n00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:49.960\n>> Yeah.\nThat's true.\n\n353\n00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.720\n>> Or something on top of that as a.\n\n354\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.260\nHopefully, right.\n\n355\n00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.987\nYou've just gotta get\nyour new certification.\n\n356\n00:20:54.987 --> 00:21:01.160\nYeah, that's the thing, and you know this\nis the thing you've got to kind of weigh\n\n357\n00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:06.440\nthings on is that, I'm with the philosophy\nthat, hey certifications are fine.\n\n358\n00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.879\nThe knowledge is the most important, so\n\n359\n00:21:07.879 --> 00:21:10.520\nI always make sure when I'm\ndoing something like this.\n\n360\n00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.330\nAll the information we've given you,\nyou can get the certification off of it.\n\n361\n00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.700\nIf you watch all the shows and\nyou're doing your studying,\n\n362\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.700\nyou can get the certification of\nthat with not much more effort.\n\n363\n00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.600\nYou have to put a little\nmore effort into it.\n\n364\n00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.000\nBut, you can still get it, off of that.\n\n365\n00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.380\nBut, we're giving you that plus, all the\nreal world stuff outside to enhance what\n\n366\n00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.650\nyou're doing to put it\nin the right context.\n\n367\n00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.580\nAnd, to me,\n\n368\n00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.490\nthat's the biggest part, the biggest\nchallenge you have, and the biggest thing\n\n369\n00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.750\nyou gotta do is you gotta make sure you\nreally have command of that knowledge.\n\n370\n00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.900\nIf you have command of the knowledge,\nthe certification is easy.\n\n371\n00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.010\nIf you're just doing stuff\nto get the certification and\n\n372\n00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.150\npad your resume, that's not gonna fly.\n\n373\n00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.610\nSomeone's going to call you out,\nthe industry knows that.\n\n374\n00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:56.280\nNo ones gonna claim, just having a piece\nof paper nowadays is gonna get you hired.\n\n375\n00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.460\nThat'll get you through the door and\nget them to talk to you,\n\n376\n00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.450\nwhich is a big step,\nall things considered.\n\n377\n00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:06.580\nHuge step but, you're still gonna have to\ndemonstrate that, so make sure when you\n\n378\n00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.600\nlook at these certifications that,\nyou're getting something that you [LAUGH].\n\n379\n00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.490\nIt's not just because oh there's\na lot of money associated with it.\n\n380\n00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.120\nThat's good but make sure that\nyou really know the information.\n\n381\n00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.260\nOne of the ones I point out nowadays.\n\n382\n00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:26.765\nThere's more Cloud certifications popping\nup, because it's becoming a technology\n\n383\n00:22:26.765 --> 00:22:32.350\nthat's very popular, or\nit is a technology that's popular.\n\n384\n00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.110\nSo there's a gap that has to be filled, so\nokay, there's vendors out there saying,\n\n385\n00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:40.410\nlet's jump on that wave and\nput a certification out, and\n\n386\n00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.310\nwe'll start charging money for it.\n\n387\n00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.140\nAnd that's kind of what their model is.\n\n388\n00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:49.450\nLet's put something out and I know there's\na Cloud security certification out there.\n\n389\n00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:53.170\nThey tell you to download two\ndocuments from someone else PDF files.\n\n390\n00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.510\nDownload these things.\n\n391\n00:22:54.510 --> 00:23:00.250\nread em, and you pay us, what was it like\n300 bucks, you can take the test twice.\n\n392\n00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.260\nIf you fail it the first time, don't pay\nagain take it a second time for that.\n\n393\n00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.585\nSo the test is either 300 dollars or\n\n394\n00:23:05.585 --> 00:23:08.789\n150 dollars depending on\n[LAUGH] how well you did.\n\n395\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.720\nThe thing is,\nthe knowledge is actually really good.\n\n396\n00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:19.720\nThe knowledge that they give about that,\nthe documents they have are really good.\n\n397\n00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.356\nBut that certification,\nnot a lot of people know about it.\n\n398\n00:23:22.356 --> 00:23:26.690\nIt's way down there as\nfar as recognition goes,\n\n399\n00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:30.850\nwhich maybe that's gonna improve, but it's\nway down there so you could kind of argue\n\n400\n00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.570\nif that's gonna help you, and you got\nto kind of use your own common sense\n\n401\n00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:38.628\non that as well as when you go to\ncertifications and training and all that.\n\n402\n00:23:38.628 --> 00:23:43.060\nSkills are the primary thing, and then\nhave the certifications are also that way\n\n403\n00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:48.060\nbut are important, but make sure it's\na certification that people recognize.\n\n404\n00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.730\nSo you've got the knowledge,\nand you've got command of it,\n\n405\n00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.700\nyou've proven it through certification.\n\n406\n00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.938\nSo good plus for you, you've done that,\nthat's what we wanna see.\n\n407\n00:23:56.938 --> 00:24:01.610\nBut if you've gone ahead and got\n\n408\n00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:05.622\na certification that no one knows what it\nis, and you have to explain who that is,\n\n409\n00:24:05.622 --> 00:24:10.660\n[LAUGH] then, and what the acronym means,\nit's like well what is that?\n\n410\n00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.910\nOkay, there's a vendor\nthat's still around.\n\n411\n00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.620\nSecurity Certified?\n\n412\n00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.530\nThey've been around for a while,\nand they were a bigger name, but\n\n413\n00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.700\ntheir marketing wasn't as great.\n\n414\n00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.270\nI've got their certification.\n\n415\n00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.660\nIt's very good information.\n\n416\n00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.720\nI wouldn't ding them one bit for\ntheir information.\n\n417\n00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.730\nBecause they cover a lot of stuff,\nin a very unique way.\n\n418\n00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:37.650\nThey do everything in there\ncourse on Window's and on Linux.\n\n419\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.060\nWhich is almost unheard of to see it\n[INAUDIBLE] okay, this is how you do it.\n\n420\n00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.020\nThis side and this side.\n\n421\n00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.690\nSo you're getting exposure to\nboth whether you like it or not.\n\n422\n00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.200\nYou will know how to do\nboth sides of the house.\n\n423\n00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.540\nThat's really cool.\n\n424\n00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.156\nBut, mention Security Certified to\nsomeone and see if they know it.\n\n425\n00:24:50.156 --> 00:24:53.600\nSo holding that certification\nwould be kinda something,\n\n426\n00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.660\nthat's gonna help you out.\n\n427\n00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.530\nWhen ever I say Security Certified,\nit's like oh, I got Security Certified.\n\n428\n00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.230\nIn what?\n\n429\n00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.912\nNo that 's the name of the certification.\n\n430\n00:24:59.912 --> 00:25:00.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n431\n00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.170\nIt is, what it is.\n\n432\n00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:05.448\nSo, that's the thing you gotta look for.\n\n433\n00:25:05.448 --> 00:25:07.893\nCertifications will come as part of that.\n\n434\n00:25:07.893 --> 00:25:12.130\n>> Alright well, I'll tell you what,\na lot of great information there, Sean.\n\n435\n00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.250\nWe're just about out of time,\nanything else you want to talk about?\n\n436\n00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.680\n>> No, I think they've probably\nheard me talk long enough.\n\n437\n00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.295\nThey're like,\nwhen are gonna go to the next stuff?\n\n438\n00:25:19.295 --> 00:25:21.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I think we're good on that,\n\n439\n00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.600\nthey've got the point across.\n\n440\n00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.640\n>> Alright, very good.\n\n441\n00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.960\nWell ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n442\n00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.190\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n443\n00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.140\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n444\n00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.154\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:13.324\nI'm your host Michael Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.870\nWith me today is Sean Oriyano,\nhow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.500\n>> Doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.440\n>> I am doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.954\nWe've got another exciting\nepisode coming your way in our\n\n8\n00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:24.172\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner\nseries.\n\n9\n00:00:24.172 --> 00:00:28.253\nThis morning we're gonna take a look at\nworking with contracts and contractors.\n\n10\n00:00:28.253 --> 00:00:30.990\nSounds like a whole lot of fun Sean.\n\n11\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.300\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.680\n>> It's something that has definitely got\n\n13\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.920\na set of concerns all its own over\n\n14\n00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.610\njust about almost everything\nelse we've talked about.\n\n15\n00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.330\nThat's why we have to\nreally talk about this and\n\n16\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.270\nwhere a CASP fits in with dealing\nwith outside contractors and vendors.\n\n17\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.550\nBecause that's the way the world works and\nperiod.\n\n18\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.490\nYou're gonna be, no matter what segment\nyou're in, if you're producing a product,\n\n19\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.880\nunless it's a very simple product or\nsomething of that nature, you're probably\n\n20\n00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.080\ngonna have to outsource work, or\nparts, or whatever to someone else.\n\n21\n00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.980\nOr if you're service related\ntype situation, you may need to\n\n22\n00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.900\nbring in people from the outside to help\nyou support whatever it is you're doing.\n\n23\n00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.310\nSo the question here comes in for\n\n24\n00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.080\na CASP is, how do you deal with\nthe unique security requirements\n\n25\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.380\nof people coming in from outside your\norganization and working with you.\n\n26\n00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.050\n>> Right cuz these are people that\nhaven't been through my training, or\n\n27\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.530\nhaven't been assigned my EULA,\nand things like that, right?\n\n28\n00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.010\nWhich can cause a problem.\n\n29\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.720\n>> Yeah, that's really it.\n\n30\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.750\nThere's a potential problem lurking there,\nor\n\n31\n00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.270\nit could be a potential\nproblem lurking there.\n\n32\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.004\nBecause those people definitely coming in\nfrom the outside, they're not your people.\n\n33\n00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:52.850\nYou know they're just not.\n\n34\n00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.758\nSo what can you do to make sure that\nthe contract that you're responsible for\n\n35\n00:02:00.758 --> 00:02:06.466\nor the product you're producing,\nmeets the standards you've set forth,\n\n36\n00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:11.104\nand is being kept under a certain\nsecrecy and stuff like that,\n\n37\n00:02:11.104 --> 00:02:13.893\nif those people don't work for you?\n\n38\n00:02:13.893 --> 00:02:18.393\nSo that's something that we're dealing\nwith here, and something that a lot of\n\n39\n00:02:18.393 --> 00:02:22.765\nyou, watching this have already dealt\nwith, in some way shape or form.\n\n40\n00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:24.595\nIt's not easy.\n\n41\n00:02:24.595 --> 00:02:28.675\nSometimes, managing a third party, or\n\n42\n00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:33.355\nexternal party,\nto help you get a project done, let's say,\n\n43\n00:02:33.355 --> 00:02:39.880\nlet's put this in terms of one\nof the situations you'll see.\n\n44\n00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.920\nIt's not uncommon to have a company\nget a government contract, let's say,\n\n45\n00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.801\nthey get a government contract, now\nwhen they have that government contract,\n\n46\n00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:55.780\nthey say, well, I don't have the manpower\nto do it on my own, so I'm gonna go out\n\n47\n00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.520\nto someone else to help me with it, and\nthat person may be getting contractors.\n\n48\n00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.250\nYou see that sort of thing.\n\n49\n00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.855\nSo, now you've got a situation\nwhere I\"m the prime contractor for,\n\n50\n00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:12.800\nlet's say, the government.\n\n51\n00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.800\nAnd I need to go to someone else\nthat got the people for me,\n\n52\n00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.090\nlike an employment agency.\n\n53\n00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.200\nI needed more whatever.\n\n54\n00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.532\nSo, they had to go find those people.\n\n55\n00:03:20.532 --> 00:03:24.956\nSo now I have requirements that\nwere imposed upon me when I won\n\n56\n00:03:24.956 --> 00:03:29.576\nthe contract that I must follow,\nor suffer the consequences.\n\n57\n00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:33.656\nAnd then I've got to make sure that that\nperson that I'm going to, or agency that\n\n58\n00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:37.740\nI'm going to, that's grabbing people for\nme to help me fulfill this contract,\n\n59\n00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.921\nI need to make sure that they meet\nthose requirements as well and\n\n60\n00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:44.854\nare upholding them, and the people that\ncome in from their are reading that.\n\n61\n00:03:44.854 --> 00:03:48.452\nBecause there's a whole chain of\nresponsibility happening there.\n\n62\n00:03:48.452 --> 00:03:51.053\nThere's certain standards that\nmust be met across the board.\n\n63\n00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:55.860\nAnd if they're not met, it can keep\nflowing uphill all the way to the person\n\n64\n00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.363\nthat's the prime has to answer for\nit and they're not gonna be happy if\n\n65\n00:04:00.363 --> 00:04:05.930\nsomething happens and they're the ones\nthat are left with egg on their face.\n\n66\n00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.800\nThey may cut you loose as the outsourcer\nbut they're the ones that are going to\n\n67\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.860\nsuffer the damage in a lot of cases and\nthat's not where they want to be.\n\n68\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.210\nAnd not where you want to be either\nbecause if you're the one that\n\n69\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.550\ndid something dumb or\n\n70\n00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.550\ndidn't adhere to certain standards,\nyou may not work in that industry again.\n\n71\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.720\nIt's been known to happen.\n\n72\n00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.390\nI know in the government's side,\n\n73\n00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.370\nbecause of the way people\nare registered in the system and\n\n74\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.400\nkept track of in the system, if you fail\nto fulfill the contract, that's on record.\n\n75\n00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.300\nSomeone else can look at that later on and\nsay,\n\n76\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.730\nwell this person did\nsomething bone-headed.\n\n77\n00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.300\nOr, had a contract pulled from them and\n\n78\n00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.370\nawarded to someone else\nbecause of compliance issues.\n\n79\n00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.500\nThat could very well just take you\ncompletely out of the game permanently.\n\n80\n00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.820\nIt's been know to happen.\n\n81\n00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.770\nYou get blacklisted, you're out.\n\n82\n00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.400\nSo we need to make sure these things\nare upheld both for our pocketbook and\n\n83\n00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.330\nour continued well being.\n\n84\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.700\nIf we want to work In that environment or\n\n85\n00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.410\nthat industry segment that\nwe're in at the current time.\n\n86\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.540\n>> All right, so\n\n87\n00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.540\nworking with partners is one of the things\nthat we're gonna have to deal with.\n\n88\n00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.090\nOur organization is probably not isolated,\nwe're not an island.\n\n89\n00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.460\nSo we've got partner businesses\nthat we have to work with.\n\n90\n00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.630\n>> Yeah, the more complex whatever it is\nyou're doing, the more complex it is,\n\n91\n00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:35.120\nunique it is and larger the scale gets,\nall of a sudden what happens is you\n\n92\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.210\nrun into a situation where you probably\ncan't do the whole thing yourself.\n\n93\n00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.730\nAnd that could be a case of,\nlike in the example I was using,\n\n94\n00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.270\nyou have to go to an outside agency that\nin turn hires the people in for you, and\n\n95\n00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.310\nvets them, and checks them, or\nat least they have them on their list.\n\n96\n00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.190\nIt can be that, or\nit can be a situation where you got,\n\n97\n00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.540\nlet's say you're building\nsomething like an aircraft.\n\n98\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.049\nThat's one from aerospace near and\ndear to my heart, I know that one.\n\n99\n00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.190\nSo you're building a new aircraft,\nlet's say.\n\n100\n00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.950\nYou're not doing that on your own,\nunless you're talking a very,\n\n101\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.170\nvery, very small aircraft.\n\n102\n00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.226\nProbably what they call RC aircraft.\n\n103\n00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:19.881\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you're building aircraft now days,\n\n104\n00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:22.160\nyou ain't doing it on your own.\n\n105\n00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.830\nIt just ain't happening.\n\n106\n00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.590\nAnd I'm talking even the private aircraft.\n\n107\n00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.770\nWhen you get the smaller ones like that.\n\n108\n00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.590\nThose ones aren't built.\n\n109\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.070\nCessna does not go out and\nbuild a whole aircraft on their own.\n\n110\n00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.180\nThey have stuff that\nthey're responsible for,\n\n111\n00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.830\nand they provide certain\nskills themselves in house.\n\n112\n00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.580\nBut the parts come from many\ndifferent people to make that.\n\n113\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.480\nFrom the engine, to the seats,\nto the instrumentation,\n\n114\n00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.122\nall those things\nare provided by outsourcers.\n\n115\n00:06:52.122 --> 00:06:53.190\nAnd so they order them from their and\nbring those parts in.\n\n116\n00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.290\nYou're talking a pretty complex\nmechanism and a lot of things revolving\n\n117\n00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.730\naround that need to happen to make sure\nthat thing is completed successfully.\n\n118\n00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:08.850\nAnd in this case it's airborne,\nso it can be a big daunting task.\n\n119\n00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.010\nWhat you're gonna do is\nyou're going to for yourself,\n\n120\n00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.760\nI mean one of the things we talked about\nduring this whole CASP stuff is we talked\n\n121\n00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.900\nabout, putting policies and procedures and\nstandards and all that stuff in place.\n\n122\n00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.910\nHopefully you've done all that.\n\n123\n00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.196\nIf you haven't then it's probably not,\n\n124\n00:07:21.196 --> 00:07:24.400\n[LAUGH] you're probably not ready to\ngo out to your outside contractor yet.\n\n125\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.630\nIf you are gonna work with\nan outside party, one of the things,\n\n126\n00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.120\nand I know, I see some of the comments\nhere in the chatroom, and\n\n127\n00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.890\nI know we've had people in\nthe past that work in that space.\n\n128\n00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.480\nI work in that space too.\n\n129\n00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.700\nAs far as working as\nan outside contractor and\n\n130\n00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:46.070\nworking as a contractor directly,\nI know that environment too.\n\n131\n00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.370\nAnd I know there's\nvariations of contracts.\n\n132\n00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.530\nThere's many different\nforms they can come in.\n\n133\n00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.051\nDifferent regulations they can place\non them and different requirements.\n\n134\n00:07:55.051 --> 00:07:57.861\nIt could be an endless sea of doing stuff.\n\n135\n00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:02.123\nThat's why you gotta hire people to\neven read those contracts the right way.\n\n136\n00:08:02.123 --> 00:08:08.177\nSo, once you've got that and you order\nthe contract, and you meet the standard,\n\n137\n00:08:08.177 --> 00:08:12.652\nif you decide to subcontract any\nof that work to anyone else,\n\n138\n00:08:12.652 --> 00:08:15.770\nthere's requirements placed on that.\n\n139\n00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.230\nBasically the person you're\ncontracting with says, you want to use\n\n140\n00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:23.530\nan outside party to do this if they\nallow it, which they usually do.\n\n141\n00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:28.050\nWhat they'll say is, go ahead,\nyou've been awarded the contract,\n\n142\n00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.070\nyou know how much money you're making.\n\n143\n00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.720\nYou know what the requirements are.\n\n144\n00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.000\nAnd you have to make sure they\nmake those requirements too.\n\n145\n00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.490\nAnd now you have to meet those\nrequirements of keeping stuff safe and\n\n146\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.620\nsecret and all that type of stuff.\n\n147\n00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.640\nIt also has to be certain\nperformance guidelines.\n\n148\n00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.540\nSo you take their stuff,\nput it in your stuff and\n\n149\n00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.240\nhand this that whole collective stuff,\nthing.\n\n150\n00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.520\nIf it doesn't meet those standards, we're\nnot going to them, we're going to you.\n\n151\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.540\nYou know, you're the ones responsible.\n\n152\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.690\nYou know, you're working on some\nclassified project and that subcontract\n\n153\n00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:04.410\nhas someone that is deciding to sell those\nsecrets to another country and what have\n\n154\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:09.250\nyou, they're gonna get everyone up that\nwhole food chain go, how did that happen?\n\n155\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:13.260\nThere's gonna be, not a head rolled,\nthere's gonna be several heads rolled\n\n156\n00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.515\nat the outsourcer and\nyou that are gonna pay for that.\n\n157\n00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:21.810\nSo it can be a pretty big situation,\nso you need to make sure you have\n\n158\n00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.310\nyour standards adhered to, you need make\nsure, you need to know what the standards\n\n159\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.090\nthat the person that's giving you\nthat work wants you to adhere to.\n\n160\n00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.540\nAnd they'll establish what standards\nthose people need to have applied to them\n\n161\n00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.940\nas well, if you're gonna get them.\n\n162\n00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.120\nAnd what you'll do to also make sure that\nthat's being done they have a process\n\n163\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.380\ncalled, really it's easy to\nfigure out what's happening,\n\n164\n00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.740\ncalled a document exchange and review.\n\n165\n00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.340\nWhich is where you'll provide some\ndocumentation to the person you've chosen\n\n166\n00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.740\nafter you've got them under a NDA or\na non-compete or both.\n\n167\n00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.270\nYou'll give them the relevant documents,\n\n168\n00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.380\ntell them this is what I\nneed you to be able to do.\n\n169\n00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.104\nAnd then they'll provide documents to you\nsaying these are the current things we\n\n170\n00:10:02.104 --> 00:10:02.660\nadhere to.\n\n171\n00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.060\nAnd they'll give you some folders or\ndocuments and all that.\n\n172\n00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.520\nAnd saying, here's what we have, here's\nwhat you have, how far apart are we,\n\n173\n00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.330\nand what can we do to make sure\nthat we're both on the same page,\n\n174\n00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.790\nand meet the standard,\nand can work together?\n\n175\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:23.370\n>> So are there particular procedures\nwe should go through when we're trying\n\n176\n00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.140\nto find somebody to work with or\nto outsource to or?\n\n177\n00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.020\n>> Yes,\nthere are definite procedures for it and\n\n178\n00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.490\nthis is again one of those cases\nwhere your mileage may vary.\n\n179\n00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:40.140\nIt depends on the specific requirements of\nthe person that's giving you that work,\n\n180\n00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.980\nor if it's you giving the work to someone\nelse, there's no one up above you,\n\n181\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.130\nthen you can have more latitude on that.\n\n182\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.960\nIf it's the case that you're working for\nsomeone else, and\n\n183\n00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.130\nyou're subcontracting that out then\n\n184\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:58.080\nthe person that's giving that to you would\nsay well, if you're gonna outsource they\n\n185\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.580\ncould very well say these are some\nguidelines that need to be followed.\n\n186\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.580\nYou need to make sure that they meet these\nthings, that they're registered here.\n\n187\n00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.100\nThat those people are, if you're here in\nthe US, they could say those people gotta\n\n188\n00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.880\nbe on US soil to do this, or they're just\nnot gonna be allowed to participate in it.\n\n189\n00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.460\nThey could put all those things in place.\n\n190\n00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:20.200\nThey can make sure you're registered\nwith the Central Contracting Register,\n\n191\n00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.670\nI think I got that right.\n\n192\n00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.460\nThey have another one called Orca,\nwhich is another one for reg.\n\n193\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.910\nThey can say that you have to be in all\nthose systems, and then they can say,\n\n194\n00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.370\nwell, if you're going to handle sensitive\ninformation, secret information,\n\n195\n00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.700\ntop secret information, they can put\nsome storage requirements in place.\n\n196\n00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:41.659\nIf you're saying, I need you to work with\nme on this super secret aircraft and\n\n197\n00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.020\nyou're working on something sensitive,\nguess what?\n\n198\n00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:49.200\nYou have to prove that you have the same\nsecure facilities that I do at your plant,\n\n199\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.570\nand you're doing everything that's\nrequired and then some to meet that.\n\n200\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:59.550\nYou need to tell me paperwork that you've\nhad for the last x number of years showing\n\n201\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.240\nme that you haven't had any breaches or\nanything like that.\n\n202\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.170\nThose will all be put into the mix\n\n203\n00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.080\nto figure out if we are compatible and\ncan work together.\n\n204\n00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.170\nIf you don't meet those things, then\nbye-bye, I literally can't work with you.\n\n205\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.410\nIf I wanna do that contract,\nI can't work with you,\n\n206\n00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.280\nI have get someone else\nthat's capable of doing that.\n\n207\n00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.820\nBut like I said, if you're you're\nan industry producing a product, like\n\n208\n00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.515\nwe'll say civilian aircraft, you're\nlike a Cessna, or something like that.\n\n209\n00:12:32.515 --> 00:12:33.790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So if you're Cessna,\n\n210\n00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.830\nyou're trying to produce those\naircraft for private means and\n\n211\n00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:42.200\nyou're gonna outsource the manufacturer\nof the seats of that aircraft,\n\n212\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.490\nand the power plant for\nthe aircraft, well guess what?\n\n213\n00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.860\nIf they're gonna make seats for that\naircraft, you're producing the product and\n\n214\n00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.690\nyou're selling it directly to customers,\nso there's no one up above you,\n\n215\n00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.170\nit's just the customer\nyou're selling it to well,\n\n216\n00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:01.840\nyou have latitude to set certain\nstandards for yourself and for them.\n\n217\n00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.753\nBut if they're making seats to put in your\naircraft, well they can't make them just\n\n218\n00:13:05.753 --> 00:13:09.540\nto have anything,\nthere's limitations placed on that.\n\n219\n00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.380\nBecause there's certain fire\nsafety standards, stuff like that.\n\n220\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.180\nSo, you can't say hey, make me x number\nof seats in this color, this color and\n\n221\n00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.330\nthis color and send it to me.\n\n222\n00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.230\nNo, they now have to be aware\nof the FAA standards and\n\n223\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.020\nsafety standards for\nthat to manufacture those,\n\n224\n00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.010\nand you have to show that they know what\nthose are and how to follow them and\n\n225\n00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.250\nare capable of doing that, and\nthen they can provide the stuff to you.\n\n226\n00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.100\nSo you may have the ability to say okay,\ncertain things on it, but\n\n227\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.750\nother things may be written in stone.\n\n228\n00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.340\nIt all really depends.\n\n229\n00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.740\nSo, this is where your legal\ndepartment comes in, very important.\n\n230\n00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.730\nBut I'll tell you when you're\nthe contracting thing,\n\n231\n00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.920\nand especially if you're a company\nthat's going to the government or\n\n232\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.000\neither the Fed's role, state,\nlocal, you're doing that,\n\n233\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.020\nthis is where you have to have somebody\nthat knows how to read contracts.\n\n234\n00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:04.230\nAnd it sounds stupid to anybody\nwho hasn't ever seen a contract.\n\n235\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.410\nIf you've ever had to see\na government contract of any sort and\n\n236\n00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.780\nhad to interpret that stuff,\nI swear looking at those things,\n\n237\n00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.840\nit kind of looks like english, but\nI don't know what the heck they're saying.\n\n238\n00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.790\nI just don't, but I I've got a friend\nI've worked with for years, and\n\n239\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.420\nshe is just fluent in that stuff.\n\n240\n00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.880\nShe'll break out spreadsheets and\neverything else,\n\n241\n00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.420\nand have everything all line by lined,\nand everything ready to go.\n\n242\n00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.110\nAnd you're just like, where'd you\nget that, there's like this much in\n\n243\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.930\nthat contract I saw, and she's like,\nhow could you not see it?\n\n244\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.090\nI don't even want to get into this.\n\n245\n00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.250\nThat's what I pay you for to do.\n\n246\n00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:46.790\nSo you just keep doing that and\nI'm gonna stand over here and goof off.\n\n247\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.460\nYou know that's what it is.\n\n248\n00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.430\nSo those people are worth their weight\n\n249\n00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.395\nin gold if you have one\nthat knows those contracts.\n\n250\n00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:59.010\nBecause you miss those things or you're\njust unaware of certain things, that's\n\n251\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:04.590\ngonna cost you because on the contractor\nside or the person that's sending out\n\n252\n00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.760\nthe contract and the contracting officer\ntype stuff, they expect you to know that.\n\n253\n00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.090\nThey could put all sorts of goofy stuff.\n\n254\n00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:15.289\nLet me tell you that, they can put\nall sorts of goofy stuff in there.\n\n255\n00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:15.997\n>> Like what?\n\n256\n00:15:15.997 --> 00:15:20.283\n>> One that I saw was, and\nthis is becoming more common,\n\n257\n00:15:20.283 --> 00:15:24.569\nI can understand why they did it,\nbut it was just odd,\n\n258\n00:15:24.569 --> 00:15:28.379\nthat you could use the lose\nthe whole contract,\n\n259\n00:15:28.379 --> 00:15:32.971\nperhaps get points taken off\nin the scoring scheme of it.\n\n260\n00:15:32.971 --> 00:15:37.985\nYou saw it where they said\nthe whole proposal you gave had\n\n261\n00:15:37.985 --> 00:15:45.900\nto be submitted in a certain format and\nall that, which is totally understandable.\n\n262\n00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:51.174\nBut then they said everything has to\nbe printed on 30% recycled paper.\n\n263\n00:15:51.174 --> 00:15:55.353\nAnd if they didn't get it, they were very\nclear that they would just chuck it out.\n\n264\n00:15:55.353 --> 00:15:57.671\nWhich is kind of funny,\nit's like You gotta be recycling, but\n\n265\n00:15:57.671 --> 00:16:00.401\nwe'll throw this away, without even\nreading it, if you don't do that.\n\n266\n00:16:00.401 --> 00:16:03.160\nIt's like isn't that just as wasteful,\nyou know.\n\n267\n00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.798\n>> Well throw it in the recycle bin.\n\n268\n00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.070\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, but\n\n269\n00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.720\nthat's something they specifically put in\nthere, that they would ding you on it.\n\n270\n00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.980\nAnd you know a friend, I know that\nactually put in on that contract.\n\n271\n00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.520\nI told them, I said did you make\nsure that he was printing it out and\n\n272\n00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.560\nI told him about a few times and when he\nprinted it out he said did you make sure,\n\n273\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.800\nI'm on the phone, did you make sure\nyou printed out this type of paper?\n\n274\n00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.530\nHe's like I don't have that type of paper,\nlike you aren't going to win the contract.\n\n275\n00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.160\nHe's like I've got everything.\n\n276\n00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.410\nMore than I need to win this contract.\n\n277\n00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.640\nHow can you say I'm not going to do that,\ncuz the government says.\n\n278\n00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.170\nIt goes, they're not going to do that,\nor they're not going to enforce that.\n\n279\n00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.590\nThey enforced it.\n\n280\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.870\n[LAUGH] You know.\nDidn't even have a chance.\n\n281\n00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:47.640\nYou had to have stuff that showed\nthat that was what he printed it on.\n\n282\n00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.097\nThey can definitely do those sorts\nof things on their [INAUDIBLE].\n\n283\n00:16:51.097 --> 00:16:56.075\nYou can understand them wanting to be\ngreen and more environmentally friendly,\n\n284\n00:16:56.075 --> 00:17:00.977\nbut yeah, and they can be very, very,\nvery upfront about some of that stuff and\n\n285\n00:17:00.977 --> 00:17:04.290\nthat is enough to lose these contracts.\n\n286\n00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.540\n>> So other things we might have\nto consider when we're dealing\n\n287\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.470\nwith contractors?\n\n288\n00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.300\nAnd contracts.\n\n289\n00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:14.680\n>> There's plenty, there's like a, the way\nI see it as far as this conversation,\n\n290\n00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:20.735\nas this conversation goes with\nanything else you gotta consider.\n\n291\n00:17:20.735 --> 00:17:23.575\nIt's like a black hole you\nkeep throwing stuff into.\n\n292\n00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:24.335\nIt'll keep disappearing.\n\n293\n00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:27.475\nEvery time you think you've got everything\ncovered, more stuff is going to pop out.\n\n294\n00:17:27.475 --> 00:17:29.995\nThe thing to really take away from\nthis if you're a contractor or\n\n295\n00:17:29.995 --> 00:17:33.692\nif you're either the one\ncontracting with someone else is or\n\n296\n00:17:33.692 --> 00:17:35.612\nyou're contracting out for someone else.\n\n297\n00:17:35.612 --> 00:17:39.192\nAnd something you've won or\nyou just need more manpower for\n\n298\n00:17:39.192 --> 00:17:44.002\nis make sure everyone's on the same\npage as far as expectations,\n\n299\n00:17:44.002 --> 00:17:48.192\nwho's what's responsibility,\nwhat type of work is being done.\n\n300\n00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:49.942\nYou need to be clear,\n\n301\n00:17:49.942 --> 00:17:53.832\nthat's the essential thing that needs to\nbe done here, that needs to be clear.\n\n302\n00:17:53.832 --> 00:17:58.380\nIt needs to be one of the things\nthat they tell me when I'm\n\n303\n00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.210\nwriting technical books is they tell\nyou that stuff needs to be written for\n\n304\n00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.330\nlike a seventh or eighth-grade level.\n\n305\n00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.180\nSounds like, what am I, an idiot?\n\n306\n00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.630\nNo, it's not that you're an idiot,\n\n307\n00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.570\nit's not that they're an idiot when\nthey're whoever reading this stuff.\n\n308\n00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:16.310\nWhen I write this book the people\nwho are reading it aren't idiots.\n\n309\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.880\nThey've got money, that's all I care\nabout, because I get royalties.\n\n310\n00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:28.010\nSo, but in all seriousness,\nthey're getting, you give them this,\n\n311\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:32.310\nthey're not dumb, but the reason why\nyou put it at that level is because\n\n312\n00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.710\nsuddenly the expectation is that pretty\nmuch everyone is going to understand that.\n\n313\n00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.310\nIt's easier to read, it's simple words,\nthere's no flowery language.\n\n314\n00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.250\nVery little as possible.\n\n315\n00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.780\nIt makes it easy,\nmakes sure everyone understands,\n\n316\n00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.530\nthere should be no ambiguity in it.\n\n317\n00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.870\nAnd we're all ready to go ahead and\nproceed.\n\n318\n00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.680\nIf you start putting\nflowery language in there,\n\n319\n00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.775\nstuff that people don't understand,\nthere's a question of.\n\n320\n00:18:53.775 --> 00:18:56.545\nOn whether or\nnot these things are gonna happen.\n\n321\n00:18:56.545 --> 00:18:57.975\nI've seen people get really creative,\n\n322\n00:18:57.975 --> 00:19:02.205\nthat they think that they turned to\nShakespeare or something like that.\n\n323\n00:19:02.205 --> 00:19:04.860\nLike, oh, look,\nI doth write this contract.\n\n324\n00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.882\nIt's like just stop it, no one cares.\n\n325\n00:19:06.882 --> 00:19:10.522\nJust write the thing in language\nthat we all understand and\n\n326\n00:19:10.522 --> 00:19:12.622\nwe'll get along just fine.\n\n327\n00:19:12.622 --> 00:19:15.792\nSo make sure you've got that\nno matter what side you're on.\n\n328\n00:19:15.792 --> 00:19:20.662\nYou're a contractor working for\nsomeone else who's working for whatever.\n\n329\n00:19:20.662 --> 00:19:24.432\nYou make sure you're clear on\nresponsibilities and the other way around.\n\n330\n00:19:24.432 --> 00:19:27.472\nYou need to make sure they're clear on\nwhat you need to provide to them because\n\n331\n00:19:27.472 --> 00:19:32.130\nit's your fault if you're not clear and\nthey do something that you don't need.\n\n332\n00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:38.690\nSo you definitely want to\nkeep that stuff in mind.\n\n333\n00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.710\n>> And then you've got on here carrying\nout relevant analysis to secure\n\n334\n00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:42.300\nthe enterprise.\n\n335\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.505\nThat's a mouthful.\n\n336\n00:19:44.505 --> 00:19:48.980\n>> So that goes back to really\nkind of boil it down to its lowest\n\n337\n00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.160\ncommon denominator there.\n\n338\n00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.710\nThat's doing the initial document review,\nand that's also,\n\n339\n00:19:54.710 --> 00:20:01.680\nif it's an ongoing contract, it's making\nsure that you have audits in place to\n\n340\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.490\nensure that stuff's being done, continuing\nto be done the way it's supposed to.\n\n341\n00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.360\nSo you set the standards up front,\nyou make sure you're all on the same page.\n\n342\n00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.930\nAfter that's done, then you have\nan ongoing thing to make sure that yes,\n\n343\n00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.550\nthings are being done.\n\n344\n00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.770\nContract I worked on with the military,\nfor example,\n\n345\n00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:21.580\none of their simple way of auditing it\nwas, or setting up the contract first,\n\n346\n00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:26.350\nwas they made sure the people that came on\nboard were certified in specific areas.\n\n347\n00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:30.130\nIf you weren't certified then you\ncouldn't play, you had to leave.\n\n348\n00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:36.720\nThey would make you go get that before\nyou could come back in to be reevaluated.\n\n349\n00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.645\nBut if you had those things and proceeded\non, this one was a five year contract.\n\n350\n00:20:41.645 --> 00:20:44.445\nContract for services,\nconsulting type stuff.\n\n351\n00:20:45.715 --> 00:20:51.405\nEvery time you left a job site and\nwent to another one you were evaluated.\n\n352\n00:20:51.405 --> 00:20:54.705\nThere was a report that was written\non the work you provided and\n\n353\n00:20:54.705 --> 00:20:59.620\nactions you performed If you,\nwhen they had this stuff written.\n\n354\n00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.290\nThey also had scoring for different areas.\n\n355\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.750\nIf you fell below\nan average over a certain\n\n356\n00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.850\nperiod of time, they would look\nat that and say what's going on?\n\n357\n00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.220\nYou know they start looking back\nthrough their old stuff and going,\n\n358\n00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:20.210\noh well why is this person becoming more\nof a concern as far as reliability goes.\n\n359\n00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:21.660\nIs it just a fad?\n\n360\n00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.865\nA couple bad things where\nthey got scores way up here,\n\n361\n00:21:24.865 --> 00:21:28.625\nand they had some really low scores,\nand that just brought it down that way.\n\n362\n00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:31.745\nOr is it a case of that they\nwere slowly creeping down,\n\n363\n00:21:31.745 --> 00:21:35.025\nand it was pulling the average\ndown slower over time,\n\n364\n00:21:35.025 --> 00:21:37.525\nso we can see a pattern\nwhere it’s going through.\n\n365\n00:21:37.525 --> 00:21:41.605\nSo they will audit these things and make\nsure the standard is being maintained.\n\n366\n00:21:41.605 --> 00:21:44.675\nAnd they would say that if you\nweren’t maintained and you came to\n\n367\n00:21:44.675 --> 00:21:48.730\nthe point where you were gonna dip below\nthe standard, they would say, okay, well.\n\n368\n00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.820\nWe need to figure out what you're\ngoing to do to correct this and\n\n369\n00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.080\nif it continues, you're out.\n\n370\n00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.150\nThat's the way it is.\n\n371\n00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:00.440\nSo, you have to know all\nthese types of things.\n\n372\n00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.800\nIt could be big management stuff.\n\n373\n00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.610\nHeck for some of the bigger contracts,\n\n374\n00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.750\nyou've got people that all they\ndo is manage the contract.\n\n375\n00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.080\nThey can't do anything else.\n\n376\n00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.010\nI've watched several friends have\ngotten a government contract for\n\n377\n00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.160\ntheir own businesses.\n\n378\n00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.940\nThey were, I've done government contracts\nas an instructor and I still do.\n\n379\n00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.690\nBut the thing is,\nI've never went through my business.\n\n380\n00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:26.410\nI don't contract directly,\nI will never contract with the government.\n\n381\n00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:31.170\nI do not have time or\nthe patience to deal that type of stuff.\n\n382\n00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:36.370\nSo I will work with people I know that\nhave won the contracts that makes it much,\n\n383\n00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.200\nmuch easier on me because I\ncan take care of my stuff.\n\n384\n00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.100\nI do not want to manage a whole contract,\nI just, like I said,\n\n385\n00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.720\nI don't have the patience for it.\n\n386\n00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.705\nPeople are gonna get hurt if\nI'm in charge of contracts.\n\n387\n00:22:48.705 --> 00:22:50.550\n[LAUGH] Gonna be me with a bat.\n\n388\n00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:55.640\nRemember that scene from Untouchables\nwhere DeNiro, that's gonna be me.\n\n389\n00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.840\nI don't have that level\nof patience with it.\n\n390\n00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.720\nBut you got big enough contractors,\npeople that's all they do.\n\n391\n00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.830\nCuz there's so many moving parts, and so\nmany things that need to be kept track of,\n\n392\n00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.690\nthere's no time for anything else.\n\n393\n00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.000\nI've had friends, like I said,\nthat were instructors.\n\n394\n00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000\nThat they got a five year contract.\n\n395\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.560\nGuess how long it's been since they\nhave five, seven year, you know,\n\n396\n00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.530\nten year contract.\n\n397\n00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.380\nGuess how long it's been since\nthe last time they've instructed.\n\n398\n00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:25.520\nFive, seven, ten years ago,\nbecause they couldn't do anything else.\n\n399\n00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.560\nThat was their whole thing.\n\n400\n00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.170\nThey had to travel around different\nlocations and make sure everything was\n\n401\n00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.390\nokay there, and they were talking\nglobal stuff they had to go around.\n\n402\n00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.990\nThey had to make sure that standards\nare being maintained with the different\n\n403\n00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.420\npeople that are out there in the field.\n\n404\n00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:45.140\nThey needed to make sure when courses\ntrained or training changed, whenever.\n\n405\n00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.960\nThat those requirements are being met.\n\n406\n00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.368\nThen you see how many people passed or\n\n407\n00:23:49.368 --> 00:23:53.340\nfailed because that also went\ninto your performance stuff.\n\n408\n00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:57.617\nAnd heck, those pass performance events\nwere for government contract, and\n\n409\n00:23:57.617 --> 00:24:02.177\nthose pass performance, guess what they\nasked for when you try to get a contract?\n\n410\n00:24:02.177 --> 00:24:07.167\nThere's very common they'll say We need\nsome examples of past performance.\n\n411\n00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:11.050\nIf you don't have that,\nwell everything else can be right there.\n\n412\n00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.810\nBut if they're asking you for\nthat and you don't provide it,\n\n413\n00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:17.740\nyou didn't meet the requirements to\neven propose anything for that contract.\n\n414\n00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.550\nThey will chuck it out and that's it.\n\n415\n00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.250\nBye, see you later.\n\n416\n00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:29.040\nIt's a big messy thing, and\nas they say, metrics matter.\n\n417\n00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:35.850\nI've seen some stuff done where\nthe contracts are written so specifically\n\n418\n00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:40.550\nthat no one else except maybe one place\ncan fill the requirements for it.\n\n419\n00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.330\nA salesperson got in there, and\n\n420\n00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:48.280\nsomeone had claimed a name for\na product, or trademarked a name,\n\n421\n00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.580\nso it salesperson in there talked that\ninto the contract for the people there.\n\n422\n00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.300\nSo if they used that name,\nthey said, that sounds really good.\n\n423\n00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.484\nThey specified in the contract, said,\nguess what, it's a tradmarked name so\n\n424\n00:24:57.484 --> 00:24:59.300\nno one else can use it,\nexcept those people.\n\n425\n00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.260\nThe contracts are submitted,\nyou can say, I can do the same thing.\n\n426\n00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:03.760\nNo you can't.\n\n427\n00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.730\nIt's not the same name,\nit will through it out.\n\n428\n00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.040\n>> There are loopholes.\n\n429\n00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:08.960\nLegalese.\n\n430\n00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.150\n>> And trust me,\nwhen you run into those types of things,\n\n431\n00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:17.040\nthe contracting side,\nyou're not just caught up the creek.\n\n432\n00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.210\nIf you're one of the people that\ndidn't win it because a little\n\n433\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:24.695\nnonsense like that pulled, there's all\nsorts of things on the other side that we\n\n434\n00:25:24.695 --> 00:25:26.635\ncan do to make sure that everyone\nis being treated equally.\n\n435\n00:25:26.635 --> 00:25:32.495\nThat's another thing that\ncomes into play is the due\n\n436\n00:25:32.495 --> 00:25:35.365\nprocess and\nall that to make sure that's being done.\n\n437\n00:25:35.365 --> 00:25:40.075\nThe same person I was mentioning,\nthis woman I know that's really savvy on\n\n438\n00:25:40.075 --> 00:25:45.430\ncontracting, she worked for\nsomeone that was perfectly\n\n439\n00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.440\ncapable of fulfilling the contract,\nwas at a lower cost, everything else.\n\n440\n00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.210\nBut every measure they should have won at,\nsomeone else won it.\n\n441\n00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.030\nAnd she just said immediately,\nyeah there's something funny going on.\n\n442\n00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.960\nShe challenged the contract, and\nwhen you challenge the contract and\n\n443\n00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:03.060\nsay there's some funny business going on,\nthey actually can't do anything with it.\n\n444\n00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.957\nThe people that won it can't do anything.\n\n445\n00:26:04.957 --> 00:26:08.580\nWork can't receipt,\nit's all on hold until that's resolved.\n\n446\n00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.610\nIn the case I'm thinking of,\n\n447\n00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.970\nshe's telling me, she got the whole\ncontract pulled from them.\n\n448\n00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.570\nContract and\noffers was pulled off managing it.\n\n449\n00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:18.820\nAnd they had to sign a new one.\n\n450\n00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.860\nThe person that won it got pulled off of\nit and they were blocked from bidding for\n\n451\n00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.590\na while because there was something\non their side they had done,\n\n452\n00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.550\nand it was rewarded to\nthe person in the second spot.\n\n453\n00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.860\nWhich wasn't her, but\nshe was still saying that she got it.\n\n454\n00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.300\nIf you're going to do this,\nyou gotta play fair.\n\n455\n00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.300\nThere's a very strong\nsense of justice in that.\n\n456\n00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.540\nSo I was just like,\nyou're not gonna play fair, you know, hey,\n\n457\n00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.710\nI'm gonna call you on it.\n\n458\n00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:41.450\nSo, I've got to work with someone else,\nwhich isn't safe.\n\n459\n00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:42.580\nThat's the way it is.\n\n460\n00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.580\nIf someone would do it to me, hey,\nif there's funny business going,\n\n461\n00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.060\nshe says that's the way\nit's supposed to work.\n\n462\n00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.120\nSo, if I see funny business going on,\nneed to do it.\n\n463\n00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.470\nYou can't let people get away with that,\nso, it's messy.\n\n464\n00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.170\nThat's why if you kind of have\nyour head spinning right now and\n\n465\n00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:01.685\nyou don't know what we said for the past\nhalf hour, then don't manage contracts.\n\n466\n00:27:01.685 --> 00:27:02.820\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\nContracts\n\n467\n00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.980\njust sounds like it opens up a whole\nother world that we've gotta dive into.\n\n468\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.780\nAnd really,\nit's taken all the requirements and\n\n469\n00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.140\nstuff that we already have to do for\nour enterprise.\n\n470\n00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:15.230\nAnd now, we're bringing other people that\nmaybe, aren't directly under our control,\n\n471\n00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:19.060\nbut still gotta fit in our umbrella to\nfollow along with all of our policies,\n\n472\n00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.040\nprocedures and rules and regulations.\n\n473\n00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:27.895\n>> Could you imagine being a casp and\nhaving to deal with this kind of stuff.\n\n474\n00:27:27.895 --> 00:27:29.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you may very well.\n\n475\n00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.170\nAnd if you deal with it,\nhey well first of all I'm sorry,\n\n476\n00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:35.490\nsecond of all that's like\na new full time job for you.\n\n477\n00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:38.640\nWe haven't seen that too much\nduring this whole caf stuff.\n\n478\n00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.370\nBut it's one of those things that\nthat's your new full-time job.\n\n479\n00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:45.310\nYou will be doing that, and other stuff,\nyou gotta find someone else.\n\n480\n00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.290\nGet an intern,\nget another person, whatever, and\n\n481\n00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.230\nlet them do it because you will not\nhave time to do that after awhile.\n\n482\n00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.110\n>> Alright well Sean lot of\ngreat information there but\n\n483\n00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:56.920\nunfortunately we are out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n484\n00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.610\nSo signing off for\nITPro TV I'm Mike Broderick.\n\n485\n00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.750\n>> And I'm Sean Relleno.\n\n486\n00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.810\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:16.320\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.480\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.250\n>> Doing pretty good, how are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.100\n>> I'm doing great,\n\n7\n00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.420\nwe've got another one of our CompTIA\nAdvanced Security Practitioner episodes\n\n8\n00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.510\ncoming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.330\nThis one we're gonna be talking\nabout cyber defense aids,\n\n10\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.600\nthat sounds exciting, Sean.\n\n11\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.332\n>> It does, doesn't it.\n\n12\n00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:32.900\nI would, if it were up to me\nI'd leave it right here and\n\n13\n00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.260\njust say leave the title up there for\nthe whole thing and like that sounds cool.\n\n14\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.710\nLet's not ruin it.\n\n15\n00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.070\n>> Not gonna help me for\nthat CompTIA exam [LAUGH].\n\n16\n00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.600\n>> I can spell it.\n\n17\n00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.415\n>> Or can you?\n\n18\n00:00:44.415 --> 00:00:44.918\nIs it hyphenated?\n\n19\n00:00:44.918 --> 00:00:46.729\n>> [CROSSTALK] Good question.\n\n20\n00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.642\nTouche.\n[LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:53.987\n>> This is an interesting area, I think.\n\n22\n00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.264\nWhen you get down to it.\n\n23\n00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:57.586\nNot just catchy title.\n\n24\n00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:59.990\nThey still put cyber in\nfront of everything.\n\n25\n00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.370\nIt sounds just so much neater that way.\n\n26\n00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.742\nCyber this.\n\n27\n00:01:04.742 --> 00:01:07.420\nYeah, but it's a neat area.\n\n28\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.490\nWhat it is, is it's new techniques and\ntechnologies and\n\n29\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.640\nall those things that are designed\nto help us more closely analyze and\n\n30\n00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.920\npattern and model the threats and\nhow they work that are coming against us.\n\n31\n00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.176\nEven including the vulnerabilities.\n\n32\n00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:24.710\n>> Oh.\n\n33\n00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.970\n>> So.\n>> I was thinking cyborg.\n\n34\n00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.096\nSorry, my bad.\n>> No.\n\n35\n00:01:27.096 --> 00:01:28.208\n[LAUGH]\n>> My bad.\n\n36\n00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:33.750\nResistance is futile.\n\n37\n00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.600\n>> Yeah,\nthey throw the word cyber in there,\n\n38\n00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.660\nbut we've gotta look at ways that\nwe can protect ourself against\n\n39\n00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.350\nall these different types of attacks\nthat are coming from cyberspace right?\n\n40\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.190\n>> Yeah, that's what's actually\nhappening here, as we're trying\n\n41\n00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.070\nto look at the existing problems,\nor new problems as the case may be.\n\n42\n00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.715\nAnd being able to deal with existing\nproblems As well as be adaptable\n\n43\n00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:57.395\nto the new stuff that's coming out.\n\n44\n00:01:57.395 --> 00:01:59.665\nFortunately there's a lot\nof things we can do.\n\n45\n00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:02.395\nNow, we are talking a little\ndifferently than we have been\n\n46\n00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:07.115\nin the past with this type of stuff cuz\nin the past when we talked about some of\n\n47\n00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:11.085\nthese different types of defenses and\nhow they can help you.\n\n48\n00:02:11.085 --> 00:02:15.855\nThe stuff we were talking about is the\ntypical rogues gallery, I mean firewalls,\n\n49\n00:02:15.855 --> 00:02:19.030\nrouters, policies, procedures,\nwe talked about all that stuff.\n\n50\n00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.420\nBut we are kind of moving it\ndown a slightly different path.\n\n51\n00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.440\nOne that we really haven't\nintroduced too much really\n\n52\n00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.700\nin any of the courses we've done.\n\n53\n00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.370\nSo this is kind of breaking\nsome new ground here so\n\n54\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.430\nwhat we've got here is\nwe're talking about for\n\n55\n00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.826\nexample, one of the things I have\nnoted here is reverse engineering.\n\n56\n00:02:36.826 --> 00:02:40.526\nReverse engineering, you've got\nan existing solution or something,\n\n57\n00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:43.021\nyou're trying to figure\nout what makes it tick.\n\n58\n00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:48.355\nSo now we're gonna employ methods that\nare designed to look at that solution and\n\n59\n00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:52.440\ndeconstruct it to figure out\nwhat really makes it tick.\n\n60\n00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.370\nNow, you gotta think about it.\n\n61\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.905\nThat sounds kind of like\nan easy proposition,\n\n62\n00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:59.484\nto reverse engineer something,\nand figure out, take it apart.\n\n63\n00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:00.640\nI've got everything there.\n\n64\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.606\n>> [CROSSTALK] I've been doing\nthat since I can remember, right.\n\n65\n00:03:02.606 --> 00:03:04.730\n[LAUGH] Everything I\ncould find in the house.\n\n66\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.620\nI took it apart.\n\n67\n00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.060\nPut it back together.\n\n68\n00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.830\n>> Yeah, it sounds like that's\nsomething you could do, and\n\n69\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.340\nin a lot of cases it does work.\n\n70\n00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.910\nBut as a mechanism that is more complex,\n\n71\n00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.710\nthen additional things\nstart coming into play.\n\n72\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.150\nAnd some cases,\nthe information you find isn't enough\n\n73\n00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.180\nto help you recreate or\nmake a copy of whatever it is you got.\n\n74\n00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.630\nThe one that I think of when I think of\nreverse engineering, it's not a cyber\n\n75\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.020\ndefense thing, but it does, I think,\nclearly illustrates the point is,\n\n76\n00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.128\nthey had a situation during\nWorld War II and after it,\n\n77\n00:03:44.128 --> 00:03:52.560\nwhere what we had the B 29,\nthe super fortress, so we had that.\n\n78\n00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.580\nAnd the Soviets when they we're asking for\n\n79\n00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.150\nhelp from us, being our ally, they were\nsaying, well, we want some of those.\n\n80\n00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.880\nAnd that was the one kept holding back\nsaying, no, no, we're not gonna do that.\n\n81\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.590\nAnd so they weren't able\nto get their hands on one.\n\n82\n00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.870\nThey really wanted one because they didn't\nhave anything even close to that at that\n\n83\n00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.250\npoint, no long-range bombing technology.\n\n84\n00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.920\nSo what happened was, and\nkind of just shortening it out, so\n\n85\n00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.533\ndon't try calling me out on it,\ncuz I'll ignore you.\n\n86\n00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:23.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There was an agreement between\n\n87\n00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.760\nthe US and the Soviet Union that\nany of our B29s that bombed Japan,\n\n88\n00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.890\nif they had any problems,\n\n89\n00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.250\nsince we couldn't move them into China at\nthat point, there was still issues there.\n\n90\n00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.960\nThey would be able to land at\na part in the Soviet Union\n\n91\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.990\nto be kept safe and out of harm's way.\n\n92\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.500\nSo, we wouldn't have any problems there.\n\n93\n00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.900\nBut the treaty we had with them at\nthe time said well, if those aircraft\n\n94\n00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.110\nlanded there, they weren't going to\nbe released until after the war.\n\n95\n00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.422\nBecause the Soviets did not\nwant to antagonize Japan.\n\n96\n00:04:54.422 --> 00:04:58.902\nThey had enough issues with Germany\nat that point, so when this event\n\n97\n00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:03.474\nhappened where they had three B29s\nland there over a period of time.\n\n98\n00:05:03.474 --> 00:05:05.119\nThey didn't release them but\n\n99\n00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:10.040\nthey also had a situation where it's like\nhey we've got some B29s, like we wanted.\n\n100\n00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.220\nSo they wanted to populate\ntheir air forces with them, so\n\n101\n00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.580\nnow they've got some copies, so what they\ndid is they reverse engineered them.\n\n102\n00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.350\nOne of them they took apart completely,\none of them they used as a trainer.\n\n103\n00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.510\nAnd one of them you used for\nsome other stuff.\n\n104\n00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.480\nWell the problem is,\n\n105\n00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.860\nis that when they took it apart, they\nfound out some of the techniques that we\n\n106\n00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.150\nhad over here in the States to form\nsheet metal and stuff like that.\n\n107\n00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.550\nThey didn't have the technology to do it,\nSo\n\n108\n00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.820\nthey effectively could not manufacture\nthose aircraft the same way.\n\n109\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.735\nSo they had to find work arounds and\nstuff like that to do, but\n\n110\n00:05:40.735 --> 00:05:43.936\nthey actually were able to put copies\nof that aircraft in the air and\n\n111\n00:05:43.936 --> 00:05:46.361\nit was actually stunned\nthe West when they saw it.\n\n112\n00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:50.332\nCuz there was pictures of Stalin having\npeople from the West out there and\n\n113\n00:05:50.332 --> 00:05:53.913\nhe's smoking a cigar and\na B29 flies over and they're like oh,\n\n114\n00:05:53.913 --> 00:05:57.710\nwell that must be one of the ones\nthey captured, it's painted over.\n\n115\n00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.120\nAnd then more of them fly over and\nit's a whole heck of a lot of them\n\n116\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.860\nflyover formation like holy crap,\nthey just did this stuff.\n\n117\n00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.180\nThey were able to find workarounds to be\nable to put these things in the air, and\n\n118\n00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.510\nthey demanded, Stalin demanded that they\nwere produced with no variation, nothing,\n\n119\n00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.340\njust exactly.\n\n120\n00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.820\nEven though the Soviets had progressed\nin some areas further than we had.\n\n121\n00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.920\nThey were able to find how to get\naround the sheet metal stuff and\n\n122\n00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.690\nthings like that.\n\n123\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.210\nBut what I'm using that as an example for\n\n124\n00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.810\nis that they were able to find a work\naround but they didn't get an exact copy.\n\n125\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.750\nThey didn't get a part for part copy.\n\n126\n00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.650\nIt sounds like they could just by\nhaving a blueprint of it right there.\n\n127\n00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.390\nA living model.\n\n128\n00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.890\nThree of them in that case.\n\n129\n00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.470\nBut they couldn't do it.\n\n130\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.750\nSo they produced one, but\nit wasn't an identical copy.\n\n131\n00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.140\nSo in the case of reverse\nengineering cyber solutions,\n\n132\n00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.720\nthat's even, some would argue,\neven more complex than a B29 would be.\n\n133\n00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.980\nI'll leave that to someone else to decide,\nwhich one's more complex.\n\n134\n00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.920\nBut the same thing still holds, that the\nunderlying techniques and technologies and\n\n135\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.950\nstuff like they use to produce.\n\n136\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.820\nThat the knowledge base that's in\nsomeone's head that produced it.\n\n137\n00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.868\nYou don't have that.\n\n138\n00:07:02.868 --> 00:07:07.570\nSo the question is,\ncan you really truly replicate it.\n\n139\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.340\nAnd a lot of cases you can go ahead and\n\n140\n00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.390\nreproduce it the exact same way,\nbut other cases you just can't.\n\n141\n00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.010\nLet's say you're reverse\nengineering software.\n\n142\n00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.875\nReverse engineering software is something\nthat's done all the time in forensics,\n\n143\n00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:26.030\nit's all the time in criminal\ninvestigations to go track back who\n\n144\n00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.300\ncreated something.\n\n145\n00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.850\nBut the reality is that to a certain\npoint you can reverse engineer it but\n\n146\n00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.390\nyou still don't have what's\nin someone's head so\n\n147\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.280\nyou're trying to figure\nout what makes it tick.\n\n148\n00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.546\nYou can find it out but\nit's a lot more difficult and\n\n149\n00:07:39.546 --> 00:07:41.558\nyou still maybe kinda\nscratching your head.\n\n150\n00:07:41.558 --> 00:07:45.981\nEither permanently or for an extended\nperiod of time to figure out what's going\n\n151\n00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:48.630\non, so\nyou've got to kind of think about that.\n\n152\n00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.331\nBut it's a necessary evil\nthough too by the way just to\n\n153\n00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:58.254\nthrow it out there,\nis when you get down to it who knows?\n\n154\n00:07:58.254 --> 00:08:03.160\nLet's just say for argument you\nare the assistant admin at some place and\n\n155\n00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.148\nthen There's some sort of a issue\nwhere you left, got fired, whatever,\n\n156\n00:08:08.148 --> 00:08:11.626\nit was a really bad breakup,\nas I like to say [LAUGH].\n\n157\n00:08:11.626 --> 00:08:16.560\nIt was left, so\nthey don't have access to you anymore, and\n\n158\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.560\nso they call me in and and you know,\nyou can put it as I'm your\n\n159\n00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.547\nequal on this scale or I'm above you in\nscale, but the thing is when I come in, if\n\n160\n00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.470\nyou didn't document what you did and what\nyou were thinking, what your motivations\n\n161\n00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.995\nwhere to set something up that way,\nyou just created a huge problem for me.\n\n162\n00:08:31.995 --> 00:08:35.170\nBecause I don't have documentation for\n\n163\n00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:39.770\nthat, so I can look at those firewall\nrules, or I can look at that software,\n\n164\n00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.410\nhow it was designed, and\nI've got to do a lot of things.\n\n165\n00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.620\nI may actually end up saying, if it's\na piece of software, I'm going to have to\n\n166\n00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.420\nrewrite this because I don't know what\nwas going through his head when he left.\n\n167\n00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.810\nYou know I just don't know that,\n\n168\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.370\nso it's going to take me too long to\nfigure it out, if I figure it out at all.\n\n169\n00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.420\nSo I just have to go through and redo it.\n\n170\n00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.260\n>> And this is what the antivirus\ncompanies are doing to our malware\n\n171\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:08:59.780\nand stuff, right?\n\n172\n00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.430\nWhen they're making their definitions,\n\n173\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.990\nthey're not talking to\nthe people that wrote the virus.\n\n174\n00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.030\nWell, depending on what conspiracy\ntheories you believe in.\n\n175\n00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.330\nBut they're capturing these\nviruses in the wild and\n\n176\n00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.390\nthey're reverse engineering them so\nthat they can patch against them.\n\n177\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.870\n>> Yup, exactly.\n\n178\n00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.910\nSomeone got that that right.\n\n179\n00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.760\nThere is only one B-29 in the U.S.\nthat can fly.\n\n180\n00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.174\nThat's Fifi,\nit's owned by the Confederate Air Force.\n\n181\n00:09:21.174 --> 00:09:23.774\nSo yeah, didn't think I knew that did you?\n\n182\n00:09:23.774 --> 00:09:27.325\n[LAUGH]\n>> So reverse engineering,\n\n183\n00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:30.740\nis it something that we see a lot of\nout there then in most organizations?\n\n184\n00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.255\nOr sounds pretty complex like you'd\nhave specialized talent to do this.\n\n185\n00:09:34.255 --> 00:09:38.905\n>> Yeah, you really do have\nto have a lot of patience and\n\n186\n00:09:38.905 --> 00:09:43.595\nspecialized talent to really\nfigure out what's going on.\n\n187\n00:09:43.595 --> 00:09:48.055\nTo use this B29 stuff as an example, heck,\n\n188\n00:09:49.095 --> 00:09:51.107\nyou and\nI with enough time we can take apart B29.\n\n189\n00:09:51.107 --> 00:09:53.001\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I don't know about you.\n\n190\n00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:56.061\nI don't know Darn thing about\nmanufacturing sheet

how hard can that be?\n\n193\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.265\nI don't know.\n\n194\n00:10:02.265 --> 00:10:03.600\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n195\n00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.150\n>> You know I have no idea.\n\n196\n00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.860\nSo don't come you know talking\nto me about that type of stuff.\n\n197\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.920\nSo, and you know, an example where we were\n\n198\n00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.045\ntalking here where you were at\nthe company and then I came in after you.\n\n199\n00:10:16.045 --> 00:10:16.890\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n200\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.480\n>> I'd at least have to be equal and\nprobably better yet\n\n201\n00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.270\nhave to be above you to really\nsuccessfully reverse engineer that,\n\n202\n00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.780\nbecause if I'm your equal that's still\ngoing to cause me some problems,\n\n203\n00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.370\nif I'm above you in skill level hopefully\nI've got a big enough picture and\n\n204\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:35.190\ngot enough advanced stuff over you\nthat I can start figuring out and for\n\n205\n00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.950\nsome stuff over it.\n\n206\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:42.700\nIt can be a very,\nvery tricky process to do.\n\n207\n00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.015\nBut it does work and for\nfar as reverse engineering software,\n\n208\n00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:52.075\nthey've caught people that\nhave created malware.\n\n209\n00:10:52.075 --> 00:10:54.825\nThey've caught them and\ntracked them back to whatever, you know,\n\n210\n00:10:54.825 --> 00:10:57.055\nrock they crawled out from under.\n\n211\n00:10:57.055 --> 00:10:58.546\nThey got him.\n\n212\n00:10:58.546 --> 00:11:05.078\nThe guy created the Melissa virus or\nworm, whatever you want to call it.\n\n213\n00:11:05.078 --> 00:11:09.158\nThe guy who created it,\nit's a very great example,\n\n214\n00:11:09.158 --> 00:11:14.909\nthey tracked him back using IP addresses\nand a whole bunch of other stuff,\n\n215\n00:11:14.909 --> 00:11:18.526\nplus some key words that\nthey actually put in,\n\n216\n00:11:18.526 --> 00:11:21.800\nthat he put in his comments into his code.\n\n217\n00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.475\nAnd someone was able, I guess someone\nwas a Simpsons expert or something,\n\n218\n00:11:25.475 --> 00:11:29.290\nbecause they were some weird word,\nI don't know, it was kwyjibo was the word.\n\n219\n00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.870\nIt was in the first\nseason of the Simpsons.\n\n220\n00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.410\nAnd this guy apparently\nwas a Simpsons fan and\n\n221\n00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.160\nput that word in there as\nkind of a goof for something,\n\n222\n00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.230\nand they were able to track it back using\nthat, and putting all this stuff in.\n\n223\n00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:47.830\nIt's done, and it's done a lot, but\nwith varying degrees of success.\n\n224\n00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.130\nYou may very well have\nto go into some place,\n\n225\n00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.030\nthe solutions that are in place\nthat you have to reverse engineer.\n\n226\n00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.840\nThink about it.\n\n227\n00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:01.820\nAnybody watching this ask yourself,\nassuming that we've all worked in IT,\n\n228\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.570\nor we've worked in some type of field\nthat this type of situation would occur,\n\n229\n00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.740\nwhere you've had to come in some place and\n\n230\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.450\nyou look at what the previous person\ndid and there's no documentation there.\n\n231\n00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.560\nIt could have been that\nthe person just left the company.\n\n232\n00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.910\nIt was an amicable split or it's something\nthat the person was flipping them off and\n\n233\n00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.890\nthen they were out the door.\n\n234\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.550\nYou pick the solution, but you don't\nhave access to that person anymore.\n\n235\n00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.770\nThe company's just not going to\nlet you talk to that person or\n\n236\n00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.370\nthere's just no way to do it.\n\n237\n00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.280\nSo now you've got to figure out what\nwas going through this person's head,\n\n238\n00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.450\nwhat they were smoking or drinking,\nwhatever, maybe both, to get that to get\n\n239\n00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:41.560\nthe end result in which case that can be\nlike trying to roll a a boulder up hill.\n\n240\n00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.430\nThat's very difficult.\n\n241\n00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.870\nYou can do it, but it's, you know.\n\n242\n00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.532\nGoing to do this stuff is a very,\n\n243\n00:12:47.532 --> 00:12:53.010\nvery tough proposition,\nbut you can be successful.\n\n244\n00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:58.350\nI can't tell you how many times I've heard\nof people, this isn't picking on Cisco,\n\n245\n00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.100\nthis is picking on some of these\npeople that are doing this.\n\n246\n00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.580\nI've heard of guys that work with many\ncases of people that work with Cisco\n\n247\n00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.420\nequipment that they just keep it in their\nhead, they don't document anything.\n\n248\n00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.610\nOr they document very little.\n\n249\n00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.650\nSo if someone else came in,\n\n250\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:15.250\nno matter how good you are at it,\nthose things are pretty complex.\n\n251\n00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.540\n>> Job security.\n\n252\n00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.270\n>> Yea.\n>> [LAUGHTER].\n\n253\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:18.910\n>> It is.\n\n254\n00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.090\nA lot of people look at it that way.\n\n255\n00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:25.230\nI've heard people blatantly go through and\nsay I've got my retirement\n\n256\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.760\nplan in place because not only can they\nnot get rid of me, no one else knows,\n\n257\n00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.120\nI'm not going to teach\nanybody when I leave,\n\n258\n00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.240\nso if they do try to look at it\nthere's no comments nothing in this.\n\n259\n00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.354\nSo guess who they got to call and\nI'm going to charge them $500 bucks\n\n260\n00:13:39.354 --> 00:13:44.210\nan hour to do this, I'm sure people\nwould like brazenly do that, so\n\n261\n00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:49.430\nreverse engineering can be a valuable\nskill for just job purposes.\n\n262\n00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.560\nBut it can also be for\nincident response too.\n\n263\n00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.100\n>> Mm hm.\n\n264\n00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.760\n>> So do not forget that.\n\n265\n00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.890\nYou could play a big, big role in there.\n\n266\n00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.400\nYou know, if you have a,\na payload that was dropped off, and\n\n267\n00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.650\nyou need to figure out\nwhat it was going after or\n\n268\n00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.320\nsomething like that, reverse engineering\nis going to play a role in that.\n\n269\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.990\nI mean you'll have something called,\nfor example,\n\n270\n00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.820\na sheep dip machine where you may move\neverything over to and test it there.\n\n271\n00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.280\nOr, you may quarantine that machine and\npoke and prod at that stuff to see\n\n272\n00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.030\nwhat it does, and\ntry to kind of figure out what's going on.\n\n273\n00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.500\nIn fact, if you think about it,\n\n274\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.910\nyou're kind of starting from\na black box environment.\n\n275\n00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.480\nYou've got a mechanism in there,\n\n276\n00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.280\nand you're trying to get\nsome result out of it.\n\n277\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.730\nSo if you don't know how it works, you've\ngot to start putting input through it,\n\n278\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.840\nwatch the output, do adjustments\nto see what's going to happen, and\n\n279\n00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:43.640\nkeep going forward, and more and more\non until you get an acceptable result.\n\n280\n00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.110\nBut who knows if you've got everything.\n\n281\n00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.150\nThat's another big issue with it.\n\n282\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.110\n>> Not only do you have to\nunderstand the technology,\n\n283\n00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.400\nyou have to understand the language\neverything is written in.\n\n284\n00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.740\nYou might be fluent in a few\ndifferent languages, but\n\n285\n00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.230\nnot the one that this is written in so\nnow you've got to learn that.\n\n286\n00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.170\n>> Yeah, that's going to come into play.\n\n287\n00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.410\nI would even factor in, when you're\ndoing this, consider the fact of.\n\n288\n00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.690\nWhen you look at some of this stuff,\nyou may have some advantages,\n\n289\n00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.050\nmaybe with the language part,\nit all depends.\n\n290\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.140\nYou're still going to be trying to,\n\n291\n00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.362\nas I remember the movie Blade,\ntrying to ice skate up hill?\n\n292\n00:15:19.362 --> 00:15:22.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You've got kind of that.\n\n293\n00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.250\nHe said it a little differently.\n\n294\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.128\nI'll let you figure out\nhow differently it was.\n\n295\n00:15:26.128 --> 00:15:31.196\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, so you still may be\n\n296\n00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:36.284\nworking against everything,\ngoing uphill on that Because you can have\n\n297\n00:15:36.284 --> 00:15:41.456\na situation where the language you\nknow is an object oriented language,\n\n298\n00:15:41.456 --> 00:15:46.399\nand they're using object oriented\nlanguage for whatever they did.\n\n299\n00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:49.972\nThat may help you because some\nof the concepts may carry over,\n\n300\n00:15:49.972 --> 00:15:54.798\nbut it doesn't mean, oh, I'm using\nVisual Basic, and they're using Visual C.\n\n301\n00:15:54.798 --> 00:15:55.822\nThey're both object oriented.\n\n302\n00:15:55.822 --> 00:16:00.066\nOkay, I can figure this out no problem,\nI know what's going on.\n\n303\n00:16:00.066 --> 00:16:03.246\n>> At a very basic fundamental level yeah,\nyou got some of that.\n\n304\n00:16:03.246 --> 00:16:06.720\nBut at some point the constructs and\nall that, that language are different,\n\n305\n00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.850\ntherefore you can't just port\nyour skills directly over.\n\n306\n00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.580\nNow if they want to jack you up and\nmess you up just use assembly or\n\n307\n00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.550\nsomething like that, or\nif they really want to, I think a LISP.\n\n308\n00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.860\nFind someone that knows LISP if you can\nactually use that anyplace anymore.\n\n309\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.670\nWell I know the place you can use it.\n\n310\n00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.380\nThrow LISP in there and\nwatch what happens.\n\n311\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.350\nPeople would be like, yeah right whatever.\n\n312\n00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.200\nYeah just burn that stuff\nwe'll start from scratch.\n\n313\n00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.320\n>> Sometimes that is actually\nthe appropriate solution right?\n\n314\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.390\n>> That may be it.\n\n315\n00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.990\nIs that when you set about.\n\n316\n00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.927\nYou've got to realize when you,\n\n317\n00:16:38.927 --> 00:16:42.780\nwhat's that saying,\nyou've got to fish or cut bait?\n\n318\n00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.180\nYou've got to make\na decision on when that is\n\n319\n00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.160\n>> Know when to hold them,\n\n320\n00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.240\nand when to fold them.\n\n321\n00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.245\n>> That works too.\n\n322\n00:16:48.245 --> 00:16:53.465\n[LAUGH] You've got to have a good idea\n\n323\n00:16:53.465 --> 00:17:00.260\nof when a good time to keep at it,\nor move on is.\n\n324\n00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.218\nOn top of that is that maybe you're going\nto have to keep pushing on because there's\n\n325\n00:17:04.218 --> 00:17:06.550\nsomething vital in there that you need.\n\n326\n00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.000\nBut, at some point, you're gonna,\n\n327\n00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.170\nusually at some point you're gonna\nhave a decision in there to make.\n\n328\n00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.650\nIt's like, do I keep going?\n\n329\n00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.090\nOr do I just say this is\nno longer gonna work,\n\n330\n00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.150\nthere's way too much\neffort involved in this.\n\n331\n00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.960\nIt's better for\nme just to re-architect a new solution.\n\n332\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.260\nInstead of deconstructing or\ntaking apart an existing one,\n\n333\n00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.710\nit just won't work that way.\n\n334\n00:17:26.492 --> 00:17:28.900\nAnd that comes with experience,\n\n335\n00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.780\nbut there's numerous cases where some\njust eventually had to scrap a system or\n\n336\n00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.040\nscrap what was in place and\nsay, we're not gonna do it.\n\n337\n00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.970\nSome people have got it down to a science,\nreally.\n\n338\n00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.497\nI think of stuff like,\na simple example, I think,\n\n339\n00:17:41.497 --> 00:17:47.008\nit's not really reverse engineering,\nbut people I know that work help desks.\n\n340\n00:17:47.008 --> 00:17:51.260\nThey have a precise amount of time,\nthey've got it down to the minute.\n\n341\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.920\nThey don't go down any further than that,\neven though it seems like they could.\n\n342\n00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.710\nThey've got it down to the minute as far\nas if there's a problem on a system,\n\n343\n00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:04.600\nand it takes more than x number of minutes\nto solve, then we're gonna reimage it.\n\n344\n00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.840\nWe're not gonna let you sit there and\nmonkey around with it anymore.\n\n345\n00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.927\nIt's like it takes me, if it takes you\nmore than 25 minutes well then, we're\n\n346\n00:18:10.927 --> 00:18:15.091\ngonna push an image down, cuz it takes us\n20 minutes to push a whole image down.\n\n347\n00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:19.205\nSo If it gets too big of a deal,\nif it's any more than a driver or\n\n348\n00:18:19.205 --> 00:18:23.260\npatching something then forget it,\nwe're not doing that.\n\n349\n00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.400\nSo you might get that way,\nyou get kind of that feeling.\n\n350\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.270\nExpect to have to do this.\n\n351\n00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:35.110\nYou may never,\never reverse engineer software.\n\n352\n00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.640\nLet me make that clear.\n\n353\n00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.350\nThat's a really unique kind of skill and\n\n354\n00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.470\nthe people that do that are in\nkind of that rarefied air.\n\n355\n00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:51.300\nAs they put out there, so\nyou may never do that, it does happen.\n\n356\n00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.820\nYou're more than likely gonna have\na bunch of stuff strung together and\n\n357\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.520\nconfigured in there.\n\n358\n00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.530\nYou're gonna have to reverse engineer\nthat and figure out what's going on.\n\n359\n00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.800\nIf it's a case of somebody put\nsomething on your network or\n\n360\n00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.600\nsomething, that you don't know who\nput it there or what's going on.\n\n361\n00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.140\nOr, it's not documented.\n\n362\n00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.950\nThen you're gonna have to\nreverse engineer that too.\n\n363\n00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.930\nThe stuff you saw in the ethical\nhacking course, think about some of\n\n364\n00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:19.460\nthose solutions I plugged into your\nnetwork, like that little drop box I had.\n\n365\n00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.200\nYou're gonna have to figure out why that\nwas there, you're gonna have to dig into\n\n366\n00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.880\nit and figure out what,\nyou crack passwords on it.\n\n367\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.110\nAnd get all the way into it to\nfigure out what I configured.\n\n368\n00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:32.230\nAnd then on top of that there's no\nrecord stored in that device of what I,\n\n369\n00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:36.970\nto use our term from yesterday,\nexfiltrated out of your network.\n\n370\n00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.760\nYou don't know,\nyou just know that something in there.\n\n371\n00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.190\nAnd that can really mess with your head.\n\n372\n00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:47.260\nAnd if I wanna really up the game on that,\nI can go one more level above that.\n\n373\n00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.800\nLet's say, you see that dropbox, that's\n\n374\n00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.760\npretty easy to have a dropbox out there\nand say okay, well, I know what that is.\n\n375\n00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.360\nI can look up the model\nnumber on the back and\n\n376\n00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.930\nI could do some research it's a dropbox.\n\n377\n00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.020\nIf I want to change the game, I grab\nmy cell phone and I can use this for\n\n378\n00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.740\nthe same purpose.\n\n379\n00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.730\nThis has software on it that\nwill do the exact same thing.\n\n380\n00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.010\nIt will do reverse\ntunnel out your network.\n\n381\n00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.900\nSo I could literally crack\nyour wireless network and\n\n382\n00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.510\nthen put this in your server room.\n\n383\n00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:14.190\nLay it someplace.\n\n384\n00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.160\nDoes that really look like\na penetration testing device?\n\n385\n00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.010\nNo, and\n\n386\n00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:23.040\nI've just really raised several bars\nin there because, who's phone is this?\n\n387\n00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.880\nI'd don't know who's phone is this.\n\n388\n00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.710\nWhy is some unknown phone\nsitting in my server room?\n\n389\n00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.420\nThat's kinda suspicious.\n\n390\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.430\nSo you're gonna go look in there.\n\n391\n00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:31.900\nNow you gotta crack the password,\n\n392\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.610\nand if there's encryption on it\nyou gotta crack the encryption.\n\n393\n00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.320\nThen your gonna have to maybe do\ntraffic analysis at some point on it.\n\n394\n00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.950\nMaybe before this happens, or after.\n\n395\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:42.580\nYou're going to have to do a lot\nof stuff to figure out what's\n\n396\n00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.160\nactually happening here.\n\n397\n00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:49.310\nAt some point you might figure out that,\nhey I can trace a tunnel\n\n398\n00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.750\ngoing from this device to\noutside the network some place.\n\n399\n00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.720\nOkay, good.\n\n400\n00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.590\nYou got that far, but\nI've already won the battle at that point.\n\n401\n00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:04.190\nBut the thing is, is that it's really\nraised the bar on difficulty there because\n\n402\n00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.985\nthis does not look like\na pen testing device.\n\n403\n00:21:06.985 --> 00:21:10.675\nSo don't be surprised if\nyou see stuff like that.\n\n404\n00:21:10.675 --> 00:21:14.675\n>> And then you've actually just mentioned\nthat analyzing network traffic is another\n\n405\n00:21:14.675 --> 00:21:19.095\nthing that we might have to do in the\ncourse of doing our reverse engineering.\n\n406\n00:21:19.095 --> 00:21:24.330\nIt's not just software or physical layout\nof equipment, but network traffic as well?\n\n407\n00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:28.370\n>> Yeah, anything that's happening\nin there, that's happening\n\n408\n00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.950\nin that network could be something\nthat could be reverse engineered.\n\n409\n00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:36.300\nNetwork traffic is one, and\nfortunately that's one of the easier ones.\n\n410\n00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.250\nAnd I say that with a big grain of salt.\n\n411\n00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:43.670\nThat's a little easier one because we have\nall these sniffing tools that help us.\n\n412\n00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.860\nWe do have access to one of the most\npowerful ones out there in Wireshark.\n\n413\n00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.040\nBut there's plenty of\nother ones out there too.\n\n414\n00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.780\nYou can just keep going.\n\n415\n00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.700\nThere's ones we even had when we\ndid our forensics exploration,\n\n416\n00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.820\nwe saw that we had ones specifically for\nthat.\n\n417\n00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.390\nThose may be more appropriate to\n\n418\n00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.640\nuse in this case because those ones\nhave signatures and stuff like that\n\n419\n00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.430\nthat could more easily help you get\nthe information you're looking for.\n\n420\n00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.190\nSo you've gotta consider what\nthe right tool for the job is, but\n\n421\n00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.110\nsniffing would definitely be one.\n\n422\n00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.910\nAs far as the actual sniffing process.\n\n423\n00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.820\nThere's nothing really as\nfar as capturing traffic and\n\n424\n00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:23.990\ndoing a sniff when you're doing reverse\nengineering that's really any different.\n\n425\n00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.280\nIf you're just talking about that process.\n\n426\n00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.270\nEverything you know about sniffing and\nusing things like Wireshark and\n\n427\n00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:33.250\npromiscuous mode or what have you,\nall those things still apply.\n\n428\n00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.865\nThe question is is once you save it out\nof those things to whatever file like\n\n429\n00:22:36.865 --> 00:22:38.835\npcap file for example.\n\n430\n00:22:38.835 --> 00:22:42.075\nWhat are you going to\ndo with the pcap file?\n\n431\n00:22:42.075 --> 00:22:44.645\nDo you have a way analyze yourself.\n\n432\n00:22:44.645 --> 00:22:50.687\nYou can run a script on it to go through\nand help you see what's going on.\n\n433\n00:22:50.687 --> 00:22:55.697\nI've got tools on that cell\nphone I just waved up here\n\n434\n00:22:55.697 --> 00:23:00.417\nthat have the ability to crawl through\nthose, they have scripts built into them.\n\n435\n00:23:00.417 --> 00:23:03.469\nThey have the ability to go through that,\npcap file, and look for\n\n436\n00:23:03.469 --> 00:23:05.697\nspecific things that\nwould be to my intention.\n\n437\n00:23:05.697 --> 00:23:10.403\nActually exports it out to another\ntext file that I can now open and\n\n438\n00:23:10.403 --> 00:23:14.360\nsee what's going on there and\ntake another look at it.\n\n439\n00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.510\nThat's going to be different than\nthe normal stuff you're used to,\n\n440\n00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.540\nbecause it's one thing to look at traffic.\n\n441\n00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.450\nAnd it's one thing to look at\ntraffic that you don't really know.\n\n442\n00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.970\nYou know the protocol, you know where\nit's coming from and going to but\n\n443\n00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.530\nyou don't know anything else beyond that.\n\n444\n00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.747\nAnd if they start wrapping it up\nwith all levels of encryption,\n\n445\n00:23:30.747 --> 00:23:33.003\nthat's just gonna add to the fun and\ngames.\n\n446\n00:23:33.003 --> 00:23:35.462\n>> Well, yeah, did not sound fun.\n\n447\n00:23:35.462 --> 00:23:37.765\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not a game I wanna play anyway.\n\n448\n00:23:37.765 --> 00:23:39.300\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's definitely not,\n\n449\n00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.499\nit can be a big, big mess.\n\n450\n00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.130\nReverse engineering or\nreverse architecting,\n\n451\n00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:50.790\nany of those type of stuff,\nit sounds like fun, and it is fun.\n\n452\n00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.386\nIt is pulling stuff apart like that.\n\n453\n00:23:52.386 --> 00:23:53.523\nI mean, who doesn't like to do that.\n\n454\n00:23:53.523 --> 00:23:54.092\nSounds like you did it.\n\n455\n00:23:54.092 --> 00:23:57.761\n>> Absolutely, and when I say it's\nnot fun, I can see it being fun if.\n\n456\n00:23:57.761 --> 00:24:01.616\nThat's all I had to do, but I'm thinking\nabout all the stuff piling up, the rest of\n\n457\n00:24:01.616 --> 00:24:04.980\nmy job piling up while I try to reverse\nengineer this piece of software.\n\n458\n00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.150\nYeah, no.\n[LAUGH]\n\n459\n00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.990\n>> It's not an easy skill,\n\n460\n00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:13.910\nbut it is done for various reasons.\n\n461\n00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.070\nHeck, don't forget,\nwhen you look at reverse engineering,\n\n462\n00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:21.800\ndon't hesitate to kind of expand\nyour brain in thinking on this,\n\n463\n00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:27.720\nbecause it may not be anything to\nlooking for anything malicious at all.\n\n464\n00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.290\nIf we chuck out the malicious part and\nwe chuck out\n\n465\n00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:36.550\nthe situation where we had someone leave\nthat set it up, but didn't document.\n\n466\n00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:41.190\nAnd we say that hey, it's just a case\nof no one that I've seen is really,\n\n467\n00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:46.920\nreally 100% perfect at documenting ok,\nMckayla doesn't count.\n\n468\n00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.420\nShe'll watch this she'll get it.\n\n469\n00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:53.330\nYou know that's, she's just, you know,\nan exception to that rule, but\n\n470\n00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.510\nyou know,\nnot everyone documents really well.\n\n471\n00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:56.490\nThey have gaps in there.\n\n472\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.270\nYou know, it's just human nature.\n\n473\n00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.280\nWell, what happens is that when you,\nis that if you have those gaps or\n\n474\n00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.510\nthings that are missed.\n\n475\n00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.330\nI mean, yeah you can,\nyou can deal with that.\n\n476\n00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.510\nThe more it's missing the tougher it gets.\n\n477\n00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:11.830\nBut if you throw that at, there's still\nanother area where reverse engineering\n\n478\n00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:16.730\nmay be helpful, and we've talked about\nit a bit here during this course, and\n\n479\n00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:22.170\nyou'll see it in other areas too, is the\nwhole certification accreditation process.\n\n480\n00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:26.900\nIf someone gives you a system\nthat you need to test out,\n\n481\n00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.430\nyou may have to actually reverse\nengineer components on that system.\n\n482\n00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.640\nSuch as, the firmware.\n\n483\n00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.450\nYou may need to do that.\n\n484\n00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:38.690\nYou may need to reverse engineer chips,\nif they're a really high security\n\n485\n00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:43.210\norganization and they're processing top\nsecret, uber classified stuff, you know.\n\n486\n00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.500\nWe're talking they're trying to hide\nalien bodies, stuff like that, you know,\n\n487\n00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.220\nthey're doing that type of stuff.\n\n488\n00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.130\nThey're really going to get in there and\n\n489\n00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:54.000\ngo over everything with a fine tooth\ncomb to figure out where things are.\n\n490\n00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.140\nJust expect that.\n\n491\n00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.360\nI've had people look\nvery closely at hardware.\n\n492\n00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.150\nI've encountered people over\nthe years that have done that.\n\n493\n00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:06.020\nIt's a very tedious and\ntrying type thing to do but\n\n494\n00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.040\nyou'll be surprised at\nthe stuff you can find.\n\n495\n00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.360\nI won't say what vendor it was,\n\n496\n00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.600\nbut I know someone that reverse\nengineered firmware on a system and\n\n497\n00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:21.440\nwhen they reverse engineered it, they\nfound that every model they looked at,\n\n498\n00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.590\nwhich pretty much they could\nassume is the whole product line,\n\n499\n00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.910\nevery model they looked at\nthe reverse engineer the firmware,\n\n500\n00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.390\nthey found out it was calling home.\n\n501\n00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:35.070\nIt was calling home to one of those\ncountries that we have a less\n\n502\n00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:40.080\nthan positive relationship with,\nthey found out it was across the board,\n\n503\n00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.310\nand clearly documented what it was doing.\n\n504\n00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:50.050\nThey did that by not only monitoring it,\nbut by\n\n505\n00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:55.840\nreverse engineering, confirming that that\ncode was in there that told it to do that.\n\n506\n00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.970\nSo you do see that.\n\n507\n00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.440\nRemember, what was it like,\n\n508\n00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.075\nit was like ten years ago when\nIBM sold their stuff to Lenovo.\n\n509\n00:27:03.075 --> 00:27:04.000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n510\n00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.320\n>> That was another issue that came up,\nwas that when IBM sold their stuff,\n\n511\n00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.950\nand I got Lenovo stuff here,\nThe question came up when\n\n512\n00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:16.780\nIBM stuff moved out of the country, it was\nlike well, there's a big issue with it.\n\n513\n00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:21.270\nIt's like well, IBM,\nthat's an American institution and\n\n514\n00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.391\none of our few PC makers here\nthat are based in the US.\n\n515\n00:27:24.391 --> 00:27:27.290\nAnd they're spinning it off, and we're\nstuck in the Senate and everything, and\n\n516\n00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:29.420\nCongress going we need to block this.\n\n517\n00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.920\nUltimately, the whole stuff went over\nwith already manufacturing them, and\n\n518\n00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.820\njust branding them IBM for IBM.\n\n519\n00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.290\nThey just assumed\nthe whole ThinkPad line and\n\n520\n00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:43.425\nall those things,\nthey assumed the whole thing.\n\n521\n00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:48.380\nFor ThinkPads now, IBM still does\nquality control on this stuff, but IBM\n\n522\n00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.630\nlicenses the name out to them and takes\nroyalties off of every one they sell.\n\n523\n00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:53.670\nSo that's what they got out of it,\n\n524\n00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:58.020\nin addition to the initial\nmoney from the sale.\n\n525\n00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:03.750\nWell, one of the concerns was that, well,\nthese things were coming from China,\n\n526\n00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.540\nwe don't want them on any government\nstuff, or anything like that.\n\n527\n00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.260\nThey were saying for\n\n528\n00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.330\na long time, well, they could have stuff\nto spy on us and everything on there.\n\n529\n00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.490\nYou have a good CNA program you should\nbe able to figure it out pretty quickly\n\n530\n00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:18.320\nyou know, if you dig through these things\nyou should be able to find that and\n\n531\n00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.350\nif you wipe the thing a reset it up and\neverything and\n\n532\n00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.200\nyou've done that reverse engineering in\nthe hardware and all of that, you know,\n\n533\n00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.870\nyou probably have picked that up and\nI would still leave it to someone\n\n534\n00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:35.050\nelse to decide if this is approved to put\non those networks of those systems or not.\n\n535\n00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:38.113\nBut I could pick up a lot by\nreverse engineering, and saying,\n\n536\n00:28:38.113 --> 00:28:42.920\nokay, I found stuff in here that's\nkind of suspect, what have you.\n\n537\n00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.200\nWhat can we do to fix that?\n\n538\n00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.550\nIs it fixable at all?\n\n539\n00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.480\nIs this an acceptable risk?\n\n540\n00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.590\nSo, that is something.\n\n541\n00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.630\nIt's funny.\nI made that comment,\n\n542\n00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.010\nI dont' care who's buying this stuff.\n\n543\n00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.670\nI don't care if the Chinese\nare making them.\n\n544\n00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:01.620\nIt doesn't bother me, it's like just have\na good CNA program that fixes this stuff.\n\n545\n00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.170\nIt says yeah, if the Chinese\ndon't like us, I don't care.\n\n546\n00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.030\nIt doesn't matter who's making them.\n\n547\n00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.490\nIf they don't like us, I don't care.\n\n548\n00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:11.570\nJust have a good program and check this\nstuff out, and you should be okay to make\n\n549\n00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.970\na decision on whether or not,\ndon't make a wild assumption on this.\n\n550\n00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:20.277\nI sat in a room full of Chinese nationals\ntoo, like, we don't get this American.\n\n551\n00:29:20.277 --> 00:29:25.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So they were kinda the same way,\n\n552\n00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.570\nChinese have the same thing with us too,\nof course, It's like you sent stuff over\n\n553\n00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:33.130\nthat's got stuff on it, they claim\nWindows had NSA, DLLs, stuff like that.\n\n554\n00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.440\nNSA actually had their bitmaps and\nstuff in them.\n\n555\n00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.420\nI was like, okay, NSA's done some stuff,\n\n556\n00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.030\nbut I rather doubt that the DLLs\nhave an NSA logo embedded into them.\n\n557\n00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.130\nThat's a little too obvious.\n\n558\n00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.955\nThat's like putting a sticker on top or\nsomething.\n\n559\n00:29:43.955 --> 00:29:46.260\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\ntell you what, Shawn,\n\n560\n00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.350\nlots of great information\nthere on cyber defense.\n\n561\n00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.960\nAnything else we wanna\nthrow it in this episode?\n\n562\n00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.810\n>> I think that it gets\nwhat we need to get across,\n\n563\n00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:58.040\nis that you understand that\ndeconstruction a solution is\n\n564\n00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.540\neither a hardware based or\nsoftware based or anything.\n\n565\n00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:06.270\nReverse engineering is something that can\nget you a long way toward getting new\n\n566\n00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.240\nanswers that you're seeking,\nthe real truthful answers.\n\n567\n00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.660\nBut it's not an easy thing to\ndo the more into the bits and\n\n568\n00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.030\nbytes and minutia and all that\nthe more difficult it's gonna get.\n\n569\n00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.390\n>> All right well there\nyou have it ladies and\n\n570\n00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.580\ngentleman that's gonna do it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n571\n00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.820\nSigning for IT Pro TV I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n572\n00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.830\n>> and I'm Sean Rianno.\n\n573\n00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:24.890\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n574\n00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:30.570\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

today is Mr.\n\n3\n00:00:12.563 --> 00:00:18.060\nShawn Oryano, how're you doing Shawn?\n\n4\n00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.170\nI am doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n5\n00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.210\n>> Oh, I can't complain, I'm excited to be\nhere, because we've go another one of our\n\n6\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.370\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner\nepisodes coming your way.\n\n7\n00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.112\nIn this one, Sean, we're going to be\nlooking at performing a review, so we\n\n8\n00:00:30.112 --> 00:00:34.448\ngotta take a look at, we're not reviewing\neverything we've gone over so far, right?\n\n9\n00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:36.538\n[LAUGH] We're actually talking about-\n>> Nope.\n\n10\n00:00:36.538 --> 00:00:40.800\n>> [LAUGH] doing a review maybe after\nan incident, or something like that?\n\n11\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.460\n>> Yeah, that's actually where we're\ngoing with this is that we are,\n\n12\n00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.930\nwe've done a lot of stuff\nover the course of the casp.\n\n13\n00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.785\nBut one of the things,\na specific way to narrow it down.\n\n14\n00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:55.700\nBecause like I said this isn't the whole\nthing, this is just a small part of it.\n\n15\n00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.830\nIs think of it in terms of documentation,\nwe've created stuff you've done.\n\n16\n00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.070\nSpecifically one of the things\nthat happens with an AR, or\n\n17\n00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.410\nafter action report, which is a review,\n\n18\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.200\none things you have with that is you're\ntrying to look at what you've done.\n\n19\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.310\nYou figure out the good things,\nthe bad things, and\n\n20\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.990\njust get a kind of clear picture of it\nwith the idea that once you have that and\n\n21\n00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.210\nhave a clear picture after\neverything's all said and done,\n\n22\n00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.610\nyou can figure out where you need to go\nin the future, where you need to kind of\n\n23\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.720\nsteer this whole thing to get the best\nresults later on down the road.\n\n24\n00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.392\nBecause no matter how well\nyou plan stuff out, and\n\n25\n00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:39.177\nhow much time you spend on it, nothing\nsurvives that initial use of it intact.\n\n26\n00:01:39.177 --> 00:01:44.197\nI remember hearing that nothing survives\nthat military poster, Murphy's laws\n\n27\n00:01:44.197 --> 00:01:49.081\nof combat says there's no plan's survives\nfirst engagement with the enemy.\n\n28\n00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:50.498\nSame type of thing,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:01:50.498 --> 00:01:52.918\n>> No plan you have is going to survive in\n\n30\n00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:58.541\ntact, it's pretty much going to go undergo\nsome tweaks or even if it's not tweaked,\n\n31\n00:01:58.541 --> 00:02:02.915\nat least someone's going to say we\ncould have done that better, or\n\n32\n00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:07.700\nwhy are we doing this, or\nsomeone doesn't put it in to the as a fix.\n\n33\n00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.370\nWho knows, but.\n\n34\n00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.830\n>> Yeah, you know we always talk about\nthese documents being living documents and\n\n35\n00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.810\nthe fact that we have to keep them up\nto date, review them every so often.\n\n36\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.860\nAnd you know, what better way to do it\nthan to have an after action review or\n\n37\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.440\nan after action report so that when we\ndo go to to review these documents and\n\n38\n00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.070\nupdate these documents, we've got a record\nof what went well, what didn't go so well,\n\n39\n00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.070\nwhat worked, what didn't work, right.\n\n40\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.840\nIf we don't have that after action review,\n\n41\n00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.620\nthen when we go to update these documents,\nhow do we know what we should be changing?\n\n42\n00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.770\n>> And that's exactly right,\nis that's the whole purpose of doing this,\n\n43\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.630\nis not to assign blame,\nor anything like that.\n\n44\n00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.160\nIt's to figure out what,\nwhere you actually stand\n\n45\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.370\nin relation to what you're doing, and\nwhat you're trying to accomplish.\n\n46\n00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.200\nAnd then building\neverything out from there.\n\n47\n00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.670\nSo it's an essential thing to do, and\n\n48\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.670\nif it's done right,\ntremendously good results off of this.\n\n49\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.780\nThose of you, I mean we have I didn't\nknow Clausewitz did that, said that one,\n\n50\n00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.635\nI didn't know it was his, but\nIt was Murphy General Murphy.\n\n51\n00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:19.789\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I did not know that's a good one.\n\n52\n00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:24.530\nI swear this is like a search engine.\n\n53\n00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.780\nThis is like the easiest\nsearch engine I have,\n\n54\n00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.429\n>> or I've ever used.\n\n56\n00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.690\nBut you know, I know we have people\nthat are have a military background.\n\n57\n00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.132\nYou may have heard the term AAR a lot.\n\n58\n00:03:38.132 --> 00:03:40.584\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We use the whole time over there.\n\n59\n00:03:40.584 --> 00:03:45.621\nIt's like, let's conduct an AAR, and so\nyou are familiar with that out there and\n\n60\n00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:50.293\nfrom that standpoint, the rest of you\ndo have an experience with it too, you\n\n61\n00:03:50.293 --> 00:03:56.165\nmay just call it AAR or you may call it\nsomething else, constant still the same.\n\n62\n00:03:56.165 --> 00:03:59.070\nUnder the right conditions,\nthat should be the situations where\n\n63\n00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.790\npeople can objectively look at their\nperformance or someone else's performance,\n\n64\n00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.560\nhopefully you don't have any\nthin skins in there, and\n\n65\n00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.270\nyou're going to say well you know,\nthat, you know that was horrible.\n\n66\n00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.510\nLook at someone's like,\nwell you didn't do this right, you know,\n\n67\n00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.340\nyou need to be doing this next time.\n\n68\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.110\nIt should be something that that person\ndoesn't look at as hey we're trying to say\n\n69\n00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.090\nhey you're stupid and\nyour an idiot and we're, and\n\n70\n00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.380\nwe're we don't want\nanything to do with you.\n\n71\n00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.170\nIt's a case of,\nhey we're trying to help you out,\n\n72\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.140\nwe're saying that was\nthe wrong way to do it.\n\n73\n00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.860\nThis is the way it needs to be done,\nwe're trying to take corrective action so\n\n74\n00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.760\nwe can all do better next time.\n\n75\n00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.820\nIt's a teaching tool as much\nas it is anything else.\n\n76\n00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.390\n>> It's constructive criticism, right?\n\n77\n00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.930\nWe're not supposed to take it personally,\neven though sometimes we do [LAUGH].\n\n78\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.640\n>> You know they tell you,\nnotice how I said that, no thin skins.\n\n79\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.710\nIf you've got a thin skin, yeah,\n\n80\n00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.150\nyou're probably going to get a little\nbit hurt from going in there.\n\n81\n00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.270\nBut that's,\nthis isn't really the time for it.\n\n82\n00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.520\nThe person that's conducting this,\nI would say if you're doing it in AAR,\n\n83\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.148\nthe person conducted is really going to\ndictate what kind of mood this takes on.\n\n84\n00:05:06.148 --> 00:05:11.910\nThings I do in the Military\nwhen I am an Officer,\n\n85\n00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.540\nI have to do this things, you know,\nnow and then all time thankfully,\n\n86\n00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.090\nyou know is I have to and do conduct AARs,\n\n87\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.440\nand I do know it's up to me because I'm\ntrying to get good information out of\n\n88\n00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.930\neverybody from the people that\nactually did it and were there.\n\n89\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.460\nAnd I only see my perspective,\nI'm trying to get their perspectives and\n\n90\n00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.980\nwhat they saw.\n\n91\n00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.040\nThey can bring up stuff about me,\nanybody in there.\n\n92\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.209\nI can bring up stuff about\nanybody in there, as well, and\n\n93\n00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:46.596\nwe're always trying to benefit off of it.\n\n94\n00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:50.297\nI always try to make sure when I\nam doing this, the tone is one of,\n\n95\n00:05:50.297 --> 00:05:54.067\nand I set it up front, but I also\ntry to make sure the tone is one of,\n\n96\n00:05:54.067 --> 00:05:56.330\nit's not one being accusations.\n\n97\n00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.050\nIt's fine for, I'll accept\nthe praise stuff when someone says\n\n98\n00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.520\nhey that was great and you were right\non point with that and did everything.\n\n99\n00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.510\nThat's totally fine.\n\n100\n00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.420\nAs they like to say,\nas I was always taught when I got up\n\n101\n00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.320\nto those ranks, you praise in public,\n\n102\n00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.077\nyou criticize in private,\nthat's just the way it kind of works.\n\n103\n00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:27.210\nSo, I discourage that and\nI encourage people to give me information.\n\n104\n00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.560\nI want them to be in a position where they\nfeel like they can say anything they want\n\n105\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.890\nand give me that, because we're\nall trying to improve off of that.\n\n106\n00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.090\nShouldn't be a case of they\nfeel like their afraid to talk.\n\n107\n00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.360\nThe other thing you've got to do with\nsomething like this is, you do want to\n\n108\n00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.770\nmake sure people are engaged with it and\nso you can get that good information.\n\n109\n00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.530\nOnce they start disengaging,\nyou lose that.\n\n110\n00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.270\nSo I like to, when I'm taking notes and\nstuff on things like this and asking\n\n111\n00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.150\nquestions, I like to get to a situation\nwhere, you could even abbreviate this, I\n\n112\n00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.790\ndon't know if they did this with you when\nyou were in, or anyone else out here, but\n\n113\n00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.410\nI had it impressed on me the abbreviated\nversion of the three ups and three downs.\n\n114\n00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.270\nPeople would give me their stuff, but\n\n115\n00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.030\nthen we'd eventually just say after\na few comments here and there.\n\n116\n00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.860\nIt's like okay let's break it up,\nwhat's three ups and three downs though.\n\n117\n00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.450\nGive me three good things,\nand three bad things.\n\n118\n00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.020\nAnd anybody can say anything they want,\nsame deal.\n\n119\n00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.980\nAnd it just makes them really quickly,\nboom, boom, boom,\n\n120\n00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.160\non both sides, and we're done.\n\n121\n00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.790\nQuick, painless, and it works.\n\n122\n00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.130\nIt really works.\n\n123\n00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.580\n>> I used to use it when I was\nteaching Microsoft classes.\n\n124\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.540\nAt the end of the class,\nI would do the three ups and\n\n125\n00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.420\nthe three downs, because that gave\nme a chance to see what worked,\n\n126\n00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.430\nwhat students liked, and\nwhat didn't work, what they didn't like.\n\n127\n00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.170\nAnd not because I was trying\nto fix anything on there end.\n\n128\n00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.230\nI was trying to fix things on my end.\n\n129\n00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.879\nBecome a better instructor.\n\n130\n00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.210\nIs there any place in particular where\nwe use these after action reviews in\n\n131\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.190\na corporate environment?\n\n132\n00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.886\nI'm sure there is a lot of\nscenarios where we might use these.\n\n133\n00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:52.610\n>> Yeah there's numerous places\nthey could be employed, but\n\n134\n00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.522\nthe one that comes to mind particularly\nis after you've had maybe a drill where\n\n135\n00:07:57.522 --> 00:08:02.212\nyou are testing a system, or It's\na response system in particular, or for\n\n136\n00:08:02.212 --> 00:08:07.202\nthat matter, an actual live incident\nafter you've responded to an incident,\n\n137\n00:08:07.202 --> 00:08:10.354\nand done all the clean up and\neverything's done.\n\n138\n00:08:10.354 --> 00:08:15.078\nAnd back to where it should be,\nor as close as you can get it.\n\n139\n00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:19.976\nIt's back to where, you can use this\nto kind of you know, after the fact,\n\n140\n00:08:19.976 --> 00:08:24.250\nto really kind of say, okay, hey,\nwe did this we are complete.\n\n141\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.597\nYou know, good job.\n\n142\n00:08:25.597 --> 00:08:26.770\nOkay, let's see.\n\n143\n00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.792\nLet's talk about any areas\nwe could improve in and\n\n144\n00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:38.023\nareas that were where we should be,\nand get the input on that.\n\n145\n00:08:38.023 --> 00:08:41.377\nI was calling that in our previous\nsegments, I called it a postmortem.\n\n146\n00:08:41.377 --> 00:08:44.479\nThat's a term they use a lot in software,\nor at least,\n\n147\n00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:47.658\nwhen I was in software development,\nthey used it a lot.\n\n148\n00:08:47.658 --> 00:08:52.000\nThey used it after\neverything was put to bed.\n\n149\n00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.124\nSounds really kind of,\nthey say, projects done.\n\n150\n00:08:54.124 --> 00:08:54.925\nWe killed it.\n\n151\n00:08:54.925 --> 00:08:56.458\nLet's do a postmortem.\n\n152\n00:08:56.458 --> 00:08:58.862\nIt was really kind of\ntwisted when they said,\n\n153\n00:08:58.862 --> 00:09:01.600\nour software solutions\ngoes from cradle to grave.\n\n154\n00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.840\nOh, that's really just gets in\nmy head now, and I'm messed up.\n\n155\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.741\nBut that's another way\nthey call as a postmortem.\n\n156\n00:09:08.741 --> 00:09:11.916\nI like AAR, or after action review or\n\n157\n00:09:11.916 --> 00:09:16.021\nreport if review is a little\ntoo formal for you.\n\n158\n00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:18.736\nSome people don't like that term,\nreport works just fine too.\n\n159\n00:09:18.736 --> 00:09:23.801\nIn fact, report might be better for\na business or enterprise environment, but\n\n160\n00:09:23.801 --> 00:09:28.714\nI do want to see is after that stuff is\nbeing done, specifically an incident,\n\n161\n00:09:28.714 --> 00:09:33.805\nthat when you look at an incident,\nyou've dealt with a real-world scenario.\n\n162\n00:09:33.805 --> 00:09:36.103\nThat's exactly when you\nshould be doing that.\n\n163\n00:09:36.103 --> 00:09:40.482\nYou did what you're supposed to do and\nyou brought your team out,\n\n164\n00:09:40.482 --> 00:09:44.475\nyou would engage whatever the problem was,\ncleaned it up.\n\n165\n00:09:44.475 --> 00:09:48.074\nAnd put everything back where it was,\nand eradicated it.\n\n166\n00:09:48.074 --> 00:09:50.163\nLet's see what worked.\n\n167\n00:09:50.163 --> 00:09:53.633\nMaybe, we've got stuff that\nwe can make the stuff work,\n\n168\n00:09:53.633 --> 00:09:55.596\nactually better down the road.\n\n169\n00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:57.384\nThat's, again, we're trying to do.\n\n170\n00:09:57.384 --> 00:09:59.613\nBut it could be after\na design is deployed.\n\n171\n00:09:59.613 --> 00:10:02.975\nMaybe, to think about it, maybe you're\ngoing through the whole design process.\n\n172\n00:10:02.975 --> 00:10:05.964\nYou deploy a new piece of software or\na new project, and\n\n173\n00:10:05.964 --> 00:10:09.995\nyou had all these nice little plans\nlaid out and the whiteboard out there,\n\n174\n00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:12.860\nlike look, there's my plan,\nisn't it gorgeous?\n\n175\n00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.556\nEveryone does that.\n\n176\n00:10:13.556 --> 00:10:15.600\nThey stand back, looking at it.\n\n177\n00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.423\nThat's pretty nice huh?\n\n178\n00:10:16.423 --> 00:10:19.576\n[LAUGH] You wanna stand back and\nadmire it.\n\n179\n00:10:19.576 --> 00:10:20.760\nLike, oh, look, that's my child.\n\n180\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.489\nTake pictures of me with it.\n\n181\n00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:26.552\nSo, you see that but you know,\nanybody that's done this for\n\n182\n00:10:26.552 --> 00:10:28.318\nany length of time knows.\n\n183\n00:10:28.318 --> 00:10:32.521\nYou put that out there no matter how\nwell you've anticipated everything.\n\n184\n00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:36.793\nLife's going to come up and tap you on the\nshoulder, and say, guess what I just did?\n\n185\n00:10:36.793 --> 00:10:41.941\nIt has a funny way of doing that so\nyou can figure out by doing and\n\n186\n00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:46.115\nAAR in those cases after\na project just occurred.\n\n187\n00:10:46.115 --> 00:10:48.436\nOkay, well something unexpected happened.\n\n188\n00:10:48.436 --> 00:10:53.049\nWas that just the way\nthe hand we were dealt and\n\n189\n00:10:53.049 --> 00:10:57.434\nthere's nothing else we could have done?\n\n190\n00:10:57.434 --> 00:10:58.932\nWe've handled it the best we could.\n\n191\n00:10:58.932 --> 00:11:03.780\nOr, saw it as a deficiency in what we\nplan that we just didn't really model\n\n192\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.768\nit accurately enough or\nway too optimistic.\n\n193\n00:11:06.768 --> 00:11:11.783\nAnd we have to then decide that maybe\nwe need to readjust our aims and\n\n194\n00:11:11.783 --> 00:11:14.570\nour kind of frame of reference a bit.\n\n195\n00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.414\nThat's the type of stuff\nthat you're trying to do.\n\n196\n00:11:17.414 --> 00:11:19.575\nBut you can use the AAR\nwith any of those things.\n\n197\n00:11:19.575 --> 00:11:22.839\nIt's particularly helpful for\nsomething big and complex,\n\n198\n00:11:22.839 --> 00:11:25.270\nsome big moving organism has taken place,\nor\n\n199\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:29.699\nsome big moving mechanism what every one\ncall it has just happened and it's done.\n\n200\n00:11:29.699 --> 00:11:33.714\nUse this, and do it as soon as afterwards,\nI saw here David said,\n\n201\n00:11:33.714 --> 00:11:37.734\nwhy everything is still fresh,\nthat is exactly you want to do it.\n\n202\n00:11:37.734 --> 00:11:42.657\nThat's why when I do an AAR when\nI'm out on drill with my guys,\n\n203\n00:11:42.657 --> 00:11:44.560\nor anything like that.\n\n204\n00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.413\nBefore everyone starts getting in\ntheir cars, going back to barracks,\n\n205\n00:11:49.413 --> 00:11:53.801\nwherever else like that,\nwherever they're headed after that.\n\n206\n00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:55.914\nOkay, let's talk about this really quick.\n\n207\n00:11:55.914 --> 00:11:59.559\nLet's get the points out really quick and\ndirty, and talk about this.\n\n208\n00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:04.481\nAnd hey, once I've got it, and I've got\nthe notes, hey, dismissed, see you guys.\n\n209\n00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:05.399\nThat's it.\n\n210\n00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:09.649\nI want to get it while it's in their head,\nwhile they're fresh, and\n\n211\n00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:10.833\nnot let that pass.\n\n212\n00:12:10.833 --> 00:12:15.449\nI do not want it to be sent out in emails\nor talking to them at the next time,\n\n213\n00:12:15.449 --> 00:12:18.275\nbecause that's just a distant memory now.\n\n214\n00:12:18.275 --> 00:12:21.258\nThey're on to something else,\nthey don't need to think about that.\n\n215\n00:12:21.258 --> 00:12:26.319\nSo, you capture that and I get the right\ncontext, I'll fill out the report.\n\n216\n00:12:26.319 --> 00:12:28.926\nI know what the mission was,\nor what was happening,\n\n217\n00:12:28.926 --> 00:12:30.592\nI can put little points on there.\n\n218\n00:12:30.592 --> 00:12:31.276\nI'm good.\nI'm done.\n\n219\n00:12:31.276 --> 00:12:32.078\nI'm happy.\n\n220\n00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:35.581\nI've got what I want and\nwe can move on from that and\n\n221\n00:12:35.581 --> 00:12:38.091\ngo on to whatever our next thing is.\n\n222\n00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:43.054\nYou even mentioned here in observers,\nthat's actually a good one to mention,\n\n223\n00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:47.657\njust FYI, is a dedicated observers or\npeople who watch what's going on.\n\n224\n00:12:47.657 --> 00:12:50.617\nWe didn't bring that up in here, but\n\n225\n00:12:50.617 --> 00:12:56.445\nthat could have when you're doing\ndrills when you're going through and\n\n226\n00:12:56.445 --> 00:13:01.334\nyou're doing response drills,\nor you are doing a project.\n\n227\n00:13:01.334 --> 00:13:05.793\nYou should have if you have a project,\nany sort of IT project should be notes and\n\n228\n00:13:05.793 --> 00:13:08.914\nmilestones along the way,\nor it would be kinda crazy.\n\n229\n00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:11.850\nIt's like, I got two milestones,\nthe starting one and the end one.\n\n230\n00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.533\nThat's not a good way to do it.\n\n231\n00:13:14.533 --> 00:13:16.819\nYou want to have check points or\nmilestones,\n\n232\n00:13:16.819 --> 00:13:19.838\nand things in document along\nthe way how it is progressing.\n\n233\n00:13:19.838 --> 00:13:23.906\nSo, those can be something that\npeople are observing, watching those,\n\n234\n00:13:23.906 --> 00:13:28.306\nobserving the overall process and things\nare getting documented and logged and\n\n235\n00:13:28.306 --> 00:13:30.752\nthat is something else\nit can get worked in.\n\n236\n00:13:30.752 --> 00:13:32.146\nIn a military environment,\n\n237\n00:13:32.146 --> 00:13:35.580\nwe can have observers that are watching\nespecially during training.\n\n238\n00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.785\nYou know, they will go out there and\nthey'll watch what's going on and\n\n239\n00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:41.832\nthey'll kick your butt right there\nif something is going wrong, or\n\n240\n00:13:41.832 --> 00:13:43.557\ntake corrective action, whatever.\n\n241\n00:13:43.557 --> 00:13:46.036\nOr, just sit there silently and\ntake notes and\n\n242\n00:13:46.036 --> 00:13:48.270\nthey'll build that into an AAR later on.\n\n243\n00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:52.531\nAll those concepts still\napply in the IT environment.\n\n244\n00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:55.083\nI know I'm using the military\nas an example, but\n\n245\n00:13:55.083 --> 00:13:59.397\ndon't let that kind of mess with you,\ngoing oh, well, this applies only there.\n\n246\n00:13:59.397 --> 00:14:00.290\nIt doesn't apply only there.\n\n247\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.114\nIt's the same type of concept.\n\n248\n00:14:02.114 --> 00:14:05.741\nSomething's happened,\nyou're trying to dissect it,\n\n249\n00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:08.769\nand get a clear picture\nof what just took place.\n\n250\n00:14:08.769 --> 00:14:13.749\n>> Would it be, like let's say we're\ndoing our incident response drills.\n\n251\n00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:17.339\nAre we gonna find one AAR at the end\nof that, or did we do one for\n\n252\n00:14:17.339 --> 00:14:21.725\nthe overall thing, and then maybe one\non some individuals or team leads?\n\n253\n00:14:21.725 --> 00:14:23.854\n>> That's actually a very,\n\n254\n00:14:23.854 --> 00:14:29.186\nvery good question to ask because\nit could be either one of those.\n\n255\n00:14:29.186 --> 00:14:31.692\nIt could be a situation where we\nhave one all encompassing one.\n\n256\n00:14:31.692 --> 00:14:37.015\nAnd I would expect to have one kind of\nmaster one if you want to call it that.\n\n257\n00:14:37.015 --> 00:14:40.683\nBut if the project is sufficiently large,\nwhere you have a lot of,\n\n258\n00:14:40.683 --> 00:14:44.829\nI say this project has a lot of tentacles\nthat are going out different ways.\n\n259\n00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:49.448\nIt's entirely possible that you could\nhave ones for the individual teams or\n\n260\n00:14:49.448 --> 00:14:54.732\ndepartments that were involved, that could\nbe incorporated into an overall report.\n\n261\n00:14:54.732 --> 00:14:59.601\nWhat you might actually be doing is you\nmight actually be taking those AARs\n\n262\n00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:01.651\nthat the individual teams do.\n\n263\n00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:04.643\nAnd while you're writing yours,\nyou may take theirs and\n\n264\n00:15:04.643 --> 00:15:08.754\nlook at the hot issues they had,\nsee if there's any commonality, if there's\n\n265\n00:15:08.754 --> 00:15:12.576\nanything that is a much bigger issue\nin your mind than just that one team.\n\n266\n00:15:12.576 --> 00:15:17.169\nAnd you can incorporate that into yours,\nand have that be the master report and\n\n267\n00:15:17.169 --> 00:15:20.927\nhave them refer to the other ones\nspecifically where it was noted\n\n268\n00:15:20.927 --> 00:15:24.268\nto get the proper context for\nthat specific incident, or\n\n269\n00:15:24.268 --> 00:15:27.841\nif it happened multiple times\nacross teams every incident.\n\n270\n00:15:27.841 --> 00:15:32.987\nBut to get back to it, if you have just\nan individual team dealing with it,\n\n271\n00:15:32.987 --> 00:15:37.396\nthen there's probably very little\nneed to have more than one.\n\n272\n00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:40.392\nIt would get messy.\n\n273\n00:15:40.392 --> 00:15:44.683\nBut once you get to a sufficiently large\none, you've gotta decide what that is.\n\n274\n00:15:44.683 --> 00:15:48.928\nOnce it gets sufficiently large and\nyou have cross organization,\n\n275\n00:15:48.928 --> 00:15:51.732\ncross department, cross team type stuff,\n\n276\n00:15:51.732 --> 00:15:55.825\nthen the attractiveness of having\nmore than one, especially,\n\n277\n00:15:55.825 --> 00:16:01.243\nif they're specialized in what they do,\nthen that becomes a much better solution.\n\n278\n00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:06.016\nYou could say in an enterprise\nenvironment, If I'm involving IT and\n\n279\n00:16:06.016 --> 00:16:09.307\nlegal, and\nI have forensics people coming in,\n\n280\n00:16:09.307 --> 00:16:13.620\nI have a forensics team\nthat's helping out with that.\n\n281\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:18.061\nThose are sufficiently different\nenough that heck, let's say,\n\n282\n00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:23.058\nit's the IT department for a big\npetroleum company something like that and\n\n283\n00:16:23.058 --> 00:16:26.246\nyou had an incident\ninvolved all those people.\n\n284\n00:16:26.246 --> 00:16:29.401\nPlus, because of whatever happened,\nsomething,\n\n285\n00:16:29.401 --> 00:16:33.282\nthere was a fire that maybe caused\ndamage to the IT side of stuff.\n\n286\n00:16:33.282 --> 00:16:36.519\nBut the fire actually also\ninjured human beings,\n\n287\n00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:40.320\nthere was smoke inhalation,\nstuff like that.\n\n288\n00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.010\nYou're probably not gonna wanna roll all\nthose into one report for everybody.\n\n289\n00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.170\nIt's probably better to have one for\neach, and\n\n290\n00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:49.670\nthen you could have those also be\nincorporated into the big one.\n\n291\n00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.620\nSo there's a master one,\n\n292\n00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.300\nand then there's ones for individual\nteams that they can go to if they want.\n\n293\n00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:59.278\nAnd you can already see that there\ncould be a lot involved in that.\n\n294\n00:16:59.278 --> 00:17:01.860\nYou're talking a lot of things happening.\n\n295\n00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:07.020\n>> Now sometimes we run into problems\nwhere there is no easy solution,\n\n296\n00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.620\nand maybe that hasn't been run into before\ntut we don't have the time to do research.\n\n297\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.390\nAnd then what do we do?\n\n298\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.791\nWell, that's a-\n>> Panick?\n\n299\n00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:19.518\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, just freak out.\n\n300\n00:17:19.518 --> 00:17:22.676\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's always happy hour somewhere.\n\n301\n00:17:22.676 --> 00:17:25.637\n>> Yeah, exactly, like four time\nzones away, that's where I'm headed.\n\n302\n00:17:25.637 --> 00:17:28.826\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n303\n00:17:28.826 --> 00:17:34.675\nwhat you might be looking at here, this\nis something that comes with experience,\n\n304\n00:17:34.675 --> 00:17:38.151\nand typically people that\nare gonna be doing what\n\n305\n00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:43.097\nwe're talking about here are gonna\nbe the more experienced people.\n\n306\n00:17:43.097 --> 00:17:47.227\nThe people that are in charge of this,\nhopefully you've got a deep\n\n307\n00:17:47.227 --> 00:17:51.799\nenough bench that you can pull someone\noff there to lead this or be in charge\n\n308\n00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:56.414\nof this that's got that experience to\nmake calls based on what they know.\n\n309\n00:17:56.414 --> 00:17:59.479\nWe say judgement calls,\nthat's what CompTIA likes to call it,\n\n310\n00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:01.670\nis you're making a judgement call.\n\n311\n00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.472\nBut I kinda don't necessarily\nlike that term, I don't know why.\n\n312\n00:18:05.472 --> 00:18:08.514\nIt just sticks in my head when\nI hear judgement call cuz it\n\n313\n00:18:08.514 --> 00:18:11.444\nmeans kind of like you just,\nhey, this is what to do.\n\n314\n00:18:11.444 --> 00:18:16.132\nIt kinda sounds like it's, to me, it's not\ncursory but it's almost getting there.\n\n315\n00:18:16.132 --> 00:18:20.192\nI am emphasizing that as an experienced\ndecision, it's an educated type deal.\n\n316\n00:18:20.192 --> 00:18:23.480\nI won't say educated guess, but\nyou kinda get the meaning there.\n\n317\n00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.375\nIs that we're saying that\nwe have someone in charge.\n\n318\n00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:32.832\nAn unusual ripple in\nyour plan has popped up.\n\n319\n00:18:32.832 --> 00:18:37.806\nWell, what we gotta do is we have that\nexperienced person that's seen things,\n\n320\n00:18:37.806 --> 00:18:42.037\noperates well under stress,\nI mean this is an incident happening,\n\n321\n00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:46.590\nsomething that was a security incident and\nthere's damage being done.\n\n322\n00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.386\nOr we had the incident at this company I\nwas just talking about, this petroleum\n\n323\n00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:54.545\ncompany, and with that, someone can make,\nthat knows how to make a judgement call.\n\n324\n00:18:54.545 --> 00:18:56.905\nCuz you may not,\nlike you said be able to do the research.\n\n325\n00:18:56.905 --> 00:18:59.050\nYou can't sit there and\nhave a fire burning and\n\n326\n00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:02.635\nbe like, I haven't seen this before,\nhold on and, what's Wikipedia say?\n\n327\n00:19:02.635 --> 00:19:06.865\nYou can't do that,\nit's just not gonna work.\n\n328\n00:19:06.865 --> 00:19:10.195\nSo what you've gotta do is you've\ngotta figure out when someone's got\n\n329\n00:19:10.195 --> 00:19:14.050\nthat experience, they can just\nmake the decisions saying, okay,\n\n330\n00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.730\nthis is what we're gonna do.\n\n331\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.310\nAnd so with that experience,\n\n332\n00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.950\nhopefully that whatever they're saying\nbased on all this is a good decision.\n\n333\n00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.500\nAnd you'll find out,\nyou get the right person in there.\n\n334\n00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.003\nIt's almost like under fire,\nthey just become kind of like ice cold.\n\n335\n00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:35.703\nIt becomes very, they know what\nthey're doing, they see everything.\n\n336\n00:19:35.703 --> 00:19:38.145\nI wanna say an almost cold and\ncalculating type thing.\n\n337\n00:19:38.145 --> 00:19:41.950\nThey just know how to go, okay,\nturn off the panicking and\n\n338\n00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:46.810\nstress, they figure out that's for\nlater, and we're gonna do this.\n\n339\n00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.999\nYou wanna find someone like that.\n\n340\n00:19:49.999 --> 00:19:52.602\nPeople like that are hard to find too.\n\n341\n00:19:52.602 --> 00:19:55.990\nIt takes a while to iron\nthat out of your system.\n\n342\n00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.820\nIt takes a lot of experience, and it takes\njust a lot of confidence in what you do.\n\n343\n00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:05.323\nI can tell you, for me, you get me in\na security incident, something like that,\n\n344\n00:20:05.323 --> 00:20:06.791\nI can get that type of way.\n\n345\n00:20:06.791 --> 00:20:10.143\nBut you get me outside of that, it's not\nlike I'm gonna freak out and panic, but\n\n346\n00:20:10.143 --> 00:20:11.100\nI'm gonna be slower.\n\n347\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:16.264\nIf you put me in charge of a situation\nwhere there's medical issues in there,\n\n348\n00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:18.100\nthat's not my specialty.\n\n349\n00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.440\nI'm gonna have a lot of trouble\nsaying okay, we're gonna do this.\n\n350\n00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.320\nBut however,\nI have been in situations like that,\n\n351\n00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.160\nsomething that person may have to do.\n\n352\n00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.581\nI've had stuff during my training for\nthe military for example.\n\n353\n00:20:31.581 --> 00:20:36.348\nThey said we need you to do this,\nget these guys over there and so on and so\n\n354\n00:20:36.348 --> 00:20:37.120\nforth.\n\n355\n00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.450\nWe did for training, I remember\ntraining situation where we did that.\n\n356\n00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.747\nSo I'm in charge of doing all\nthe stuff and moving stuff over there.\n\n357\n00:20:43.747 --> 00:20:47.070\nAnd part of the thing\nrequired engineering skills.\n\n358\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.020\nWell, I'm not that type of engineer.\n\n359\n00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.690\n[LAUGH] But I knew on my team I had a guy\n\n360\n00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.870\nthat was a contractor and\nhe was an engineer.\n\n361\n00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:01.520\nThe guy worked on ships and stuff like\nthat, so he knew this types of stuff.\n\n362\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.730\nAnd I had another guy that\nwas actually very good on\n\n363\n00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:09.150\nplaying devil's advocate with\nhim in a constructive way.\n\n364\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.650\nSo as soon as they said, we need this\nstuff over here, I turned around and\n\n365\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.810\njust said, okay, you get me a solution,\nyou're working with him and says, go.\n\n366\n00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.300\nAnd that was it.\n\n367\n00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.430\nThat's something that someone has.\n\n368\n00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:22.160\nI was able to stay calm in that situation\nbecause I knew I had the resources.\n\n369\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.310\nMost people have to know that too.\n\n370\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.370\nThey have to be willing, the people who\nare in charge, to make a judgement call.\n\n371\n00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:31.079\nIf they don't have the direct experience\nwith that, they know who does and\n\n372\n00:21:31.079 --> 00:21:34.604\ncan say okay,\nthat's the person that's handling it.\n\n373\n00:21:34.604 --> 00:21:39.350\nThis case that I was talking about,\nI'd been around these guys for\n\n374\n00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:43.560\nquite a long time at this point,\nknew who had what skill.\n\n375\n00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.750\nSo I just went oh, you're coming with\na solution, you're gonna be with him.\n\n376\n00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.644\nGo, get out of here.\n\n377\n00:21:47.644 --> 00:21:51.592\n>> Part of it might be knowing\nwhat you don't excel at, and\n\n378\n00:21:51.592 --> 00:21:54.532\nas you said, understanding your team and\n\n379\n00:21:54.532 --> 00:21:58.824\nwhat their skills are, and\nbeing able to put that ego aside.\n\n380\n00:21:58.824 --> 00:22:01.529\nAnd saying look, I know I'm in charge but\nyou take care of this.\n\n381\n00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:05.774\n>> Yeah,\nthat's exactly the way it is is that,\n\n382\n00:22:05.774 --> 00:22:11.420\nif you don't know it,\nget the appropriate resources.\n\n383\n00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.420\nI know my limitations and, for me,\n\n384\n00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:18.690\nI'm not a medical person,\nI'm not a specialist in those areas.\n\n385\n00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.939\nBut, sounds funny, I went through\nEMT stuff and everything else.\n\n386\n00:22:21.939 --> 00:22:23.692\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not a medical person.\n\n387\n00:22:23.692 --> 00:22:25.781\nTrust me I'm the last\nperson you wanna see-\n\n388\n00:22:25.781 --> 00:22:27.012\n>> You slept through the first [LAUGH]\n\n389\n00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:29.766\n>> I'm like whatever, I know this stuff,\n\n390\n00:22:29.766 --> 00:22:33.014\nI got my biology stuff,\nwhatever, I studied.\n\n391\n00:22:33.014 --> 00:22:36.947\nTrust me, you get hurt, you do not want\nto see this face leaning over you going,\n\n392\n00:22:36.947 --> 00:22:37.901\nhow can I help you?\n\n393\n00:22:37.901 --> 00:22:40.664\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You should just pick up your arm and\n\n394\n00:22:40.664 --> 00:22:44.403\ncarry it to the nearest emergency room,\nor duct tape that thing on and\n\n395\n00:22:44.403 --> 00:22:47.317\ncall it a day cuz you ain't\ngetting much help from me.\n\n396\n00:22:47.317 --> 00:22:53.690\nSo, it's being able to work in that\nsituation, identify it, like I said.\n\n397\n00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.453\nI don't know how to handle those\nthings but I know who does.\n\n398\n00:22:56.453 --> 00:22:58.961\nSo just turn around, and\nthe cool thing about it is,\n\n399\n00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:02.951\nif you've established that and you're able\nto do that, those people not only will\n\n400\n00:23:02.951 --> 00:23:05.752\nwork better with you because\nyou've got that team there.\n\n401\n00:23:05.752 --> 00:23:10.044\nBut also, they recognize that you're\nin charge, you gave them that's like,\n\n402\n00:23:10.044 --> 00:23:13.972\ndo this and come back to me with a\nsolution, which is what I did in my case.\n\n403\n00:23:13.972 --> 00:23:17.122\nIt's like you, you're doing this, and\nyou're working with him and figure out,\n\n404\n00:23:17.122 --> 00:23:18.440\nlet's go over there to look at it.\n\n405\n00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.420\nWe'll take care the stuff over here.\n\n406\n00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.910\nWhen you got a solution that's workable,\nget back to me and tell me what it is.\n\n407\n00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.150\nOr if you have a couple, come back and\n\n408\n00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.220\nwe'll figure out which one is\nthe less risky and we'll go for it.\n\n409\n00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.218\nThat was it, let's just get movement\ngoing, let's not just sit around there.\n\n410\n00:23:31.218 --> 00:23:35.208\nAnd that's an even worse thing,\nsomeone that's experienced,\n\n411\n00:23:35.208 --> 00:23:38.397\neven if a solution may not\nwork right then and there,\n\n412\n00:23:38.397 --> 00:23:42.690\nan experienced person's gonna say,\nno, well, let's get moving.\n\n413\n00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:47.460\nOne of the things I hate when I'm doing my\nstuff on any of my drills or training or\n\n414\n00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:52.020\nstuff like that is, and this happens\nwith projects too in the IT world,\n\n415\n00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.110\nit will tick me off really quickly.\n\n416\n00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.250\nIf people are sitting there and\n\n417\n00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:59.980\nthey're saying, well we gotta\ntalk about this, talk about this.\n\n418\n00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.570\nI don't wanna talk about stuff for\ntoo long, don't sit around here and\n\n419\n00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.450\nhave some big convention and\neverything on there.\n\n420\n00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.898\nI don't wanna hear it, okay?\n\n421\n00:24:08.898 --> 00:24:13.247\nGo, take some time, figure this out, and\ndon't take a couple of hours or something,\n\n422\n00:24:13.247 --> 00:24:15.530\ntake five minutes or\nso and let's get going.\n\n423\n00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:16.960\nIf it doesn't work, we did something,\n\n424\n00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.700\nwe got movement, and so\nwe discovered what doesn't work.\n\n425\n00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.710\nLet's get something happening.\n\n426\n00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.040\nSo you have to have people that are\nwilling to, at some point, decide that.\n\n427\n00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.689\nThey've gotta do something, and\nthat's gonna be true in IT.\n\n428\n00:24:31.689 --> 00:24:35.031\nIf you've got an incident happening,\nyou've got that fire burning or\n\n429\n00:24:35.031 --> 00:24:37.550\nsomething, you can't just\nsit there on your hands.\n\n430\n00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.572\nIf you can't think of a solution,\nyou don't have the people around you,\n\n431\n00:24:39.572 --> 00:24:42.230\nyou know you're deficient in those areas,\nokay, well let's put our\n\n432\n00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.760\nheads together really quick, see what we\ncan do, and let's get something happening.\n\n433\n00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.420\nIt's better than just sitting\nhere waiting for it to get worse.\n\n434\n00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:54.840\n>> All right, well Sean, a lot of great\ninformation there, talking about AARs,\n\n435\n00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:59.650\nor after action reviews, and\nmaking those important judgment calls.\n\n436\n00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.233\nAnything else we want to throw in to\nthis episode before we call it a day?\n\n437\n00:25:02.233 --> 00:25:03.592\n>> Did you notice how much\nI was using knife hands?\n\n438\n00:25:03.592 --> 00:25:05.229\nAll the military guys\nknow what I am doing.\n\n439\n00:25:05.229 --> 00:25:07.434\nI was like, I was really going for it.\n\n440\n00:25:07.434 --> 00:25:10.127\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As a warrant you know this,\n\n441\n00:25:10.127 --> 00:25:13.355\nsee I'm getting to be a chief,\nI really got it going on right there.\n\n442\n00:25:13.355 --> 00:25:15.526\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n443\n00:25:15.526 --> 00:25:18.337\n>> But no I don't have anything to add to\n\n444\n00:25:18.337 --> 00:25:20.251\nthis discussion [LAUGH].\n\n445\n00:25:20.251 --> 00:25:21.505\n>> All right, well very good.\n\n446\n00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:23.490\nI hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this episode.\n\n447\n00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:24.849\nI know we enjoyed making it.\n\n448\n00:25:24.849 --> 00:25:27.229\nBut signing off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n449\n00:25:27.229 --> 00:25:28.274\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n450\n00:25:28.274 --> 00:25:29.632\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n451\n00:25:29.632 --> 00:25:30.490\n[SOUND]\n\n",

Rodrick.\n\n3\n00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.880\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.080\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.661\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:18.272\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.272 --> 00:00:19.380\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.530\nWe got another exciting\nepisode coming your way in\n\n9\n00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.330\nour CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner\nseries.\n\n10\n00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.920\nIn this one, we're gonna be talking\nabout integrating discipline.\n\n11\n00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.496\nSo bringing in, I don't know Sean,\nwhat are we talking about, or\n\n12\n00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:32.849\nwhat different disciplines\nare we even talking about here?\n\n13\n00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:33.627\n>> Good and bad.\n\n14\n00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:38.700\n[LAUGH] We'll talk disciplines here.\n\n15\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.850\nRemember we're talking about or\nassuming enterprise size organization.\n\n16\n00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.230\nSo once we push that out of the way,\nand we've got that,\n\n17\n00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.180\nwe're all on the same page with that.\n\n18\n00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.310\nRemember that you've got people who\nwork across many different fields and\n\n19\n00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.250\nin many different areas.\n\n20\n00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.230\nSo that's what we're talking about,\nwe're talking about disciplines.\n\n21\n00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.820\nWhen you start having all those different\ndisciplines, different trainings,\n\n22\n00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.380\ndifferent type of like that come together.\n\n23\n00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.332\nYou're bound to have some sort of\na [LAUGH] coming together of worlds.\n\n24\n00:01:10.332 --> 00:01:10.844\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:13.484\n>> Or, as some people would call,\n\n26\n00:01:13.484 --> 00:01:17.370\nthe come to Jesus event situation.\nYou're gonna have that\n\n27\n00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.290\ncollision of all these things and you\ngotta bring, you get a handle on that and\n\n28\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.470\nbe aware that that's gonna\nhappen before it becomes a mess.\n\n29\n00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.510\nIf you wait too long, it will,\n\n30\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.790\nI assure you, become a mess because\nyou'll have disagreements on things.\n\n31\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.950\nYou'll have people that aren't\nspeaking the same language and\n\n32\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.410\neveryone thinks they're more important\nthan someone and then everyone else, so\n\n33\n00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.466\nthere can be a lot of things that need to\ntake place when you integrate in this.\n\n34\n00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:47.790\nFortunately, if you know, first of all,\nwhen you're talking about that,\n\n35\n00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.550\nwe mentioned that experience stuff in\nthe previous episode if you watched it.\n\n36\n00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.680\nWe mentioned that experience, nothing\nreally trumps that, that's a big thing.\n\n37\n00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.170\nSo in being calm and\n\n38\n00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.120\ncool, so that's a big thing to have here\nbecause you have to have someone in charge\n\n39\n00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.470\nof this whole thing, that's able\nto kind of, get a handle on it.\n\n40\n00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.133\nBe aware of what's happening,\nwhat's coming, and\n\n41\n00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:12.230\nbe able to kinda head off problems\nat the past and anticipate.\n\n42\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.640\nSo, we've got that.\n\n43\n00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.750\nBut so, we have all of these\ndifferent disciplines.\n\n44\n00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.715\nGood thing to remember, when you get\ndisciplines with it is that one of the big\n\n45\n00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:23.887\nproblems come from every discipline or\nwe can break it down and\n\n46\n00:02:23.887 --> 00:02:27.990\nsay every department, every team is gonna\nhave someone that is in charge of it.\n\n47\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.280\nThat is undoubtedly put in that\nposition because they, well hopefully,\n\n48\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.199\nthey're put in that position\nbecause they got some experience,\n\n49\n00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.445\nI was saying undoubtedly,\nhopefully they were.\n\n50\n00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:41.360\nSometimes you can have a moron\nin there [LAUGH] that do\n\n51\n00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.348\nnot know what they're doing.\n\n52\n00:02:44.348 --> 00:02:47.771\nThey got there for whatever reason, no\none else wanted to take it, they got it.\n\n53\n00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:49.872\nI understand that.\n\n54\n00:02:49.872 --> 00:02:52.376\n>> Well, they'd like to think where\nyou need volunteers, wait for\n\n55\n00:02:52.376 --> 00:02:55.121\nsomebody to step forward and\neverybody else takes a step back, right?\n\n56\n00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:59.900\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or volentold as they sometimes call it.\n\n57\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.260\nSo you get that, you get that situation.\n\n58\n00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.670\nWell, we'll leave that one,\nwe'll kind of leave that,\n\n59\n00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.816\nwe'll push that one off the table.\n\n60\n00:03:07.816 --> 00:03:10.880\nAssume that people like that got in charge\nof these teams are there because they have\n\n61\n00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.071\nmore experience and rise that.\n\n62\n00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:14.378\nCompTIA doesn't really,\njust for the record,\n\n63\n00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:17.136\ndoesn't really account for\nthe other situation anyway,\n\n64\n00:03:17.136 --> 00:03:20.920\nthat you have someone there that got there\nbecause no one else wanted to take it.\n\n65\n00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.090\nThey're assuming a well oiled machine.\n\n66\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.440\nIn the real world, we know how that works,\nso just work with me on that, and\n\n67\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.905\nassume that blah blah blah,\nthe other stuff doesn't happen.\n\n68\n00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:36.010\n[COUGH] The people that are in\ncharge of those teams, remember that\n\n69\n00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.735\nthe people that are in charge of those\nteams, they have the experience,\n\n70\n00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:43.820\nthey're put there because they've\ngot experience, hopefully.\n\n71\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.080\nAnd they've got leadership skills, they've\ngot the ability to control a team and\n\n72\n00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.760\nkeep them organized and\nkeep them moving towards a common goal.\n\n73\n00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.270\nThose people do have strong personalities.\n\n74\n00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.053\nAnd I'm being nice about it when\nI say strong personalities.\n\n75\n00:03:58.053 --> 00:04:02.157\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] If\nit ends with an a and\n\n76\n00:04:02.157 --> 00:04:07.813\nends with an e, or\nbegins with an a and ends with an e.\n\n77\n00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:08.579\nWords you're thinking of then.\n\n78\n00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll let you to kinda take that.\n\n79\n00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.875\n[COUGH] Rhymes with firetruck.\n\n80\n00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:19.770\n[LAUGH] You get those types of things, you\nget people with very strong personalities,\n\n81\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.940\nand that goes with the territory.\n\n82\n00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.000\nI'm not gonna say that I,\nthat I don't have a strong personality,\n\n83\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.770\nif you put me in charge\nof that type of stuff.\n\n84\n00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.660\nI got to where I am both here and in the\nmilitary side of things because I've got\n\n85\n00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.310\na personality that fits that profile and\nallows me to do those sorts of things.\n\n86\n00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.940\nSo, if I'm gonna be put charge of it, one\nof the things I've got to realize, if I'm\n\n87\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.000\ngonna integrate all those people make\nthem run like that well oiled machine.\n\n88\n00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.190\nI have to have a personality\nthat's at least as strong or\n\n89\n00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.300\nprobably stronger than theirs\nbecause I'm the one who has to\n\n90\n00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.370\nbring them all under control and\nmake sure they work together.\n\n91\n00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.905\nI can't have these people\nsaying over here saying, hey,\n\n92\n00:05:01.905 --> 00:05:06.005\nwhere our stuff's more important, to hell\nwith those guys, I can't have those guys\n\n93\n00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:08.485\nsaying the same thing and\neveryone else in between whining.\n\n94\n00:05:08.485 --> 00:05:11.335\nI need everyone on the same page,\nI need the strong personalities to get in\n\n95\n00:05:11.335 --> 00:05:13.703\nthe line and\nwork towards that common problem.\n\n96\n00:05:13.703 --> 00:05:18.500\nAnd towards resolution and do it in such\na way that I should never have to be in\n\n97\n00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.005\na situation where I'm in the one in charge\nof it, in charge of that or I'm saying,\n\n98\n00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:24.800\nokay, you will be doing this and\nyou will be that.\n\n99\n00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.573\nIt should be a case where I'm able to, by\nmy presence and by my talking, I can play\n\n100\n00:05:29.573 --> 00:05:34.419\nthe diplomat but also being to play that\nstrong role there, where it's like I need\n\n101\n00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.910\nyou to do this, and can you take care\nof this, can you work with those guys?\n\n102\n00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.450\nAnd I can do it in such a way that those\npeople do it cuz they want to do it,\n\n103\n00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.275\nstuff that they may think they're\nmore important to someone else but\n\n104\n00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:46.945\nthey see that there's\na need to work with it.\n\n105\n00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:47.695\nAnd someone else and\n\n106\n00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:50.705\nthey're willing to work with it and\ncome towards that resolution.\n\n107\n00:05:50.705 --> 00:05:54.575\nIt's a very delicate and trying skill.\n\n108\n00:05:54.575 --> 00:05:56.130\nIt does take time to develop.\n\n109\n00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.205\nIt took me awhile to learn it myself.\n\n110\n00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:03.155\nIf you're not a natural leader, even\nif you are, there's natural leaders but\n\n111\n00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:06.670\nthere's not a lot of natural\nleaders that are able to,\n\n112\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.670\nas you get to that more specialized skill,\nthere's fewer and fewer of them.\n\n113\n00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.680\nSome people are just natural at it,\nthey can go to any place you put them and\n\n114\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.550\nstart, just by their presence, they can\nget you to do something and you're like\n\n115\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.950\nyou do it and you're like did that person\njust tell me to do that and I just did it?\n\n116\n00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.740\nAnd it makes you realize that they were\ntelling you to do it and they made it so\n\n117\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.460\nsmooth and so, and put it in such\na way that you were like, yeah.\n\n118\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.930\nThat needs to be done, you're right.\n\n119\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.650\nI buy into that, I'm okay with that.\n\n120\n00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.200\nSo, [COUGH] that's an important skill.\n\n121\n00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.316\n>> And\nthis helps us achieve that end goal,\n\n122\n00:06:38.316 --> 00:06:41.129\nthat secure solution that\nwe're trying to develop.\n\n123\n00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.794\n>> Yeah, you will not, if you do not\nintegrate, if you do not take a leadership\n\n124\n00:06:44.794 --> 00:06:48.253\nrole, do not get these key stake\nholders as leaders in all these areas.\n\n125\n00:06:48.253 --> 00:06:50.676\nYou do not get them to work together,\nit means,\n\n126\n00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:53.292\nyou have everyone moving\noff their own direction.\n\n127\n00:06:53.292 --> 00:06:57.174\nIn which case, you got a method that's\nnot build a firm foundation, and\n\n128\n00:06:57.174 --> 00:07:00.820\nyou got people just getting further and\nfurther and further apart.\n\n129\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.034\nEveryone thinks stuff's getting done, they\nthink they're the center of the universe.\n\n130\n00:07:04.034 --> 00:07:06.695\nBut everything's drifting apart and\neventually,\n\n131\n00:07:06.695 --> 00:07:09.235\nyou've got a bunch of\nislands sitting out there,\n\n132\n00:07:09.235 --> 00:07:13.484\nthat you've got to find someway to bring\nthem back together, that could be messy.\n\n133\n00:07:13.484 --> 00:07:18.791\nI remember when was doing my astronomy,\n\n134\n00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:27.079\nfit my physics stuff years ago\nwhen I was a bored, apparently.\n\n135\n00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:31.680\n[LAUGH] I was really bored, I'm a nerd,\nso you guys know that by now.\n\n136\n00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.509\nThey had this thing we're talking about,\nstuff that,\n\n137\n00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:37.227\nit was something related\nto the universe expanding.\n\n138\n00:07:37.227 --> 00:07:38.362\nBut the model they used,\n\n139\n00:07:38.362 --> 00:07:41.445\nthey said imagine if you had a bunch\nof corks floating in the water and\n\n140\n00:07:41.445 --> 00:07:44.983\nyou had an ant on each one and just let\nthem go, and they start drifting apart.\n\n141\n00:07:44.983 --> 00:07:47.339\nIt's that every one of them see\neverything else drifting away from them,\n\n142\n00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:49.059\nthey think that they're\nthe center of the universe.\n\n143\n00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:52.262\nBut meanwhile, they just see\neverything more and more distant away,\n\n144\n00:07:52.262 --> 00:07:54.814\nthe other guys see everyone\nelse getting distant away,\n\n145\n00:07:54.814 --> 00:07:58.580\nthey all think they're the center of\nthe universe, but they're not, no one is.\n\n146\n00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.875\nEveryone is drifting away in some way\nshape or form and we can't see it.\n\n147\n00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:06.056\nUnless we're outside\nobjectively looking at that.\n\n148\n00:08:06.056 --> 00:08:10.560\nIf you think about that, that's kind of\nthe same thing that's happening here.\n\n149\n00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.180\nWe're the objective person and if we're\nnot careful and keep them all together and\n\n150\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.390\nconnected, they're gonna just drift apart.\n\n151\n00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.970\nAnd with all those things moving in\ndifferent directions and not staying\n\n152\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.950\nconnected or anything close to that, you\ndo not have something that's gonna work.\n\n153\n00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.210\nThey have to talk.\n\n154\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.430\nThey have to work together.\n\n155\n00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.930\nThey have to come towards that solution.\n\n156\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.053\nOnce you get them working together,\nthat's a big plus.\n\n157\n00:08:33.053 --> 00:08:38.075\nNow you can apply a security policy and\nprocedure to them and have them work\n\n158\n00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:43.664\non different things and have each one of\nthose things snap into all the other ones.\n\n159\n00:08:43.664 --> 00:08:49.109\nAnd overall, you've woven together\nthis tapestry of solutions that works.\n\n160\n00:08:49.109 --> 00:08:52.343\nSo you really gotta be able to\nvisualize that situation and\n\n161\n00:08:52.343 --> 00:08:55.842\nunderstand the situation,\nunderstand the significance of,\n\n162\n00:08:55.842 --> 00:08:59.220\nthey can't just think they're\nthe center of the universe.\n\n163\n00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.870\nThey have to realize they're just one\n\n164\n00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.810\npiece of the machine that\nmakes the whole thing work.\n\n165\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.230\nWe gotta do this together\ncuz we can't do it apart.\n\n166\n00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.080\n>> And so how does governance fit into\nthe role, or into our solutions here?\n\n167\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.510\n>> Governance is one of those terms\nthat they throw around a lot, and\n\n168\n00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:21.440\nyou really kinda gotta understand where\nwe're going when we talk about governance.\n\n169\n00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.220\nGovernance is, it means that,\nin a general sense,\n\n170\n00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.390\nthat what we're doing here is gonna\nmatch up with everything else.\n\n171\n00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.890\nSo, we're all, again,\nmoving the same direction.\n\n172\n00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.390\nIn the case of doing security and\n\n173\n00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.490\nhaving governance with that,\ncuz they have IT governance.\n\n174\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.430\nThey have security governance.\n\n175\n00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.320\nHeck, if we back off for a second and\nsay we have IT governance,\n\n176\n00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.800\nthat means that our IT solution\nis supporting the business.\n\n177\n00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.630\nIt's not the business supporting the\nsolution, cuz that's not the way it works.\n\n178\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.970\nEven though some people think it does.\n\n179\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.190\nThat's one of the reasons\nwhy I was just telling you,\n\n180\n00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.854\nyou have all these ants moving\noff in different directions, and\n\n181\n00:09:56.854 --> 00:09:59.048\nthey all think they're\nthe center of the universe.\n\n182\n00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:03.368\nIf you allow that condition to continue.\n\n183\n00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:08.619\nYou will run into a situation where\nsomeone's gotta, the IT department for\n\n184\n00:10:08.619 --> 00:10:13.786\nexample's like, okay, we're gonna\nbuild this stuff, why can't these\n\n185\n00:10:13.786 --> 00:10:19.095\npeople do stuff this way or that way,\nmaking it more difficult on us.\n\n186\n00:10:19.095 --> 00:10:21.310\nWell, cuz you're not center\nof the universe, you're not.\n\n187\n00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.540\nAll those things have to\nsupport the business.\n\n188\n00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.440\nYou have a job cuz the business exists.\n\n189\n00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.750\nThe business doesn't exist because of you,\nit's not that way.\n\n190\n00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.310\nSo governance means that we\nare supporting, and this,\n\n191\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.710\nin IT governance, we're supporting\nwhat the business needs to do.\n\n192\n00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.190\nThe business has processes and\nstuff that happens.\n\n193\n00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.845\nWe need to have IT wrapped around it and\nthen to continue on the theme,\n\n194\n00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:50.573\nwe've got the business and then, you got\nIT wrapped around that just like an onion.\n\n195\n00:10:50.573 --> 00:10:53.057\nNow, we have security wrapped around that,\ntoo.\n\n196\n00:10:53.057 --> 00:10:59.030\nSecurity supports IT and then by\nextension, the actual business itself.\n\n197\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:03.255\nSo, you have these different layers, but\nyour governance makes sure that someone\n\n198\n00:11:03.255 --> 00:11:07.380\nis keeping an eye on things and\nmonitoring to make sure they're all\n\n199\n00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.680\nmoving along towards the same goal and\nare all on the same page.\n\n200\n00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.670\nYou can't have them going\noff in different directions.\n\n201\n00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:20.260\nThis is a good one Roberto brings up in\nhere, it says, IT is seen an expense.\n\n202\n00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.910\nThat is something that, yeah,\nunfortunately that's a common opinion,\n\n203\n00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.450\nthat IT is an expense and\nit is an expense.\n\n204\n00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:32.220\nBut also, it has to be understood\n\n205\n00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:37.420\nthat one of the reasons why the business\ncan function as well as it does and\n\n206\n00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.620\ncommunicate as fast and\nget stuff done is because of IT.\n\n207\n00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.550\nSo it can't just be seen that,\nwhy do we need those guys?\n\n208\n00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.410\nWe need those guys because those guys\nallow you to work more efficiently and\n\n209\n00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.110\nyou don't have to go on your\ntypewriter and type stuff off and\n\n210\n00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.990\nput it in an envelope and\ncarry it some place.\n\n211\n00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.640\nYou don't have to do that garbage anymore.\n\n212\n00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.420\nYou don't have to go through and pull\nout a calculator to add your stuff up.\n\n213\n00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.330\nThey've got Excel installed someplace,\nyou can bring it up,\n\n214\n00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.360\npunch your stuff in and put your\nformulas in and everything's done.\n\n215\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.810\nThose things have to work together,\n\n216\n00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.660\nbut IT is an expense that,\nthat expense is a necessary expense.\n\n217\n00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.250\nAnd I know some may argue that, but\nit's a necessary expense that supports\n\n218\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.860\nthe business, and\nthen security wraps around that.\n\n219\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.080\nThe one I would say is IT is seeing\nexpense, or that we're seeing that\n\n220\n00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:27.100\nnegative view of it dissipate, cuz people\ndo realize that the way technology is now,\n\n221\n00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.610\nthey'd be up the creek without a paddle.\n\n222\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:36.070\nIf it wasn't for IT,\nthey'd be really stuck.\n\n223\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.100\nI always want to think\nwhen I was in Alaska,\n\n224\n00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.010\nthey have a place in\nAnchorage called Ship Creek.\n\n225\n00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.673\nI said ship, as in boat.\n\n226\n00:12:43.673 --> 00:12:45.842\nAnd it's funny to say,\ncuz you think I said the other thing and\n\n227\n00:12:45.842 --> 00:12:46.854\nyou're gonna rewind that.\n\n228\n00:12:46.854 --> 00:12:47.834\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n229\n00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:50.414\n[LAUGH] when you say you're up\nthe creek without a paddle,\n\n230\n00:12:50.414 --> 00:12:51.777\nI'm thinking of that creek.\n\n231\n00:12:51.777 --> 00:12:55.155\nSo [LAUGH], did he say?\n\n232\n00:12:55.155 --> 00:12:56.170\nDon't edit that.\n\n233\n00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.460\nLeave it the way it is.\n\n234\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.660\nSo, but\nI would say the IT stuff's dissipating.\n\n235\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.220\nIt's more, you're still seeing that,\nwhat IT use to have,\n\n236\n00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.200\nwe're seeing security get that now.\n\n237\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.980\nIs security's supporting\nthe overall stuff of the business.\n\n238\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:15.620\nBut there's a saying that security's\na black-hole that you throw money into and\n\n239\n00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.140\nyou never get it back.\n\n240\n00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.430\nBut, by the same token,\n\n241\n00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:24.780\nsomething that we got is without security,\nyou can lose it a lot faster.\n\n242\n00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.570\nBut we gotta be careful\nnot to put it that way.\n\n243\n00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.800\nWe know that, you know that,\nbut we can't sit here and say,\n\n244\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.760\nwithout us,\nyou're gonna lose a lot of money.\n\n245\n00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:38.890\nThat's beating somebody with a stick\ninstead of using the carrot instead.\n\n246\n00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.160\nOverall, that's what governance does,\n\n247\n00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.430\nit makes sure everything's\naligned with one another.\n\n248\n00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.450\nAnd they will do that through\nsomething that we saw and\n\n249\n00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.610\ntalked about earlier on in our episodes,\nwas through auditing.\n\n250\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.160\nAuditing's a very common\nthing to do to make\n\n251\n00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.850\nsure that we're all\nstill working together.\n\n252\n00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:59.933\nThat's, for example, just to kind of use\nit as a measuring stick, not to endorse\n\n253\n00:13:59.933 --> 00:14:04.742\nthat specific one, but the information\nsecurity audit that ISACA puts out.\n\n254\n00:14:04.742 --> 00:14:08.346\nThe CISA, C-I-S-A,\nthat's one of the things that,\n\n255\n00:14:08.346 --> 00:14:10.534\nthat credential is out there for.\n\n256\n00:14:10.534 --> 00:14:14.872\nIs it makes sure that when you're looking\nat an organization, that organization,\n\n257\n00:14:14.872 --> 00:14:18.859\nyou know how to use certain metrics and\nmodels like COBIT and stuff like that.\n\n258\n00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:21.182\nTo see if they're following\naccepted policies,\n\n259\n00:14:21.182 --> 00:14:23.893\nif they're doing stuff the way\nthey're supposed to, and\n\n260\n00:14:23.893 --> 00:14:27.242\nthen to make sure everything is all\naligned to go in the same direction.\n\n261\n00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:30.120\n>> Yeah cuz, in the end,\nwe've gotta have the same goals and\n\n262\n00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.420\nif each department is handling\nsecurity independently.\n\n263\n00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.610\nAnd they're not working together,\nwe can end up with a real mess right?\n\n264\n00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.304\n>> Yeah, if you're all in a canoe and\n\n265\n00:14:39.304 --> 00:14:42.928\nyou're paddling in different directions\nand not paddling the same way,\n\n266\n00:14:42.928 --> 00:14:46.250\nyou get nowhere fast,\nthat's another good way to think about it.\n\n267\n00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.760\nThey all have to be going the same\ndirection, if they're not,\n\n268\n00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.820\nyou're either not gonna get there or\nyou're gonna get there a lot slower.\n\n269\n00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:58.222\n>> So how do we go about determining\nwhat our security requirements are?\n\n270\n00:14:58.222 --> 00:15:03.200\n>> We've touched upon that in different\nspots throughout this whole CASP stuff\n\n271\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.579\nis how do we figure out what it is,\nwhat we're supposed to be doing?\n\n272\n00:15:07.579 --> 00:15:11.920\n>> And I'm not gonna pull any punches or\nkid you on it.\n\n273\n00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.420\nIt's definitely not gonna\nbe an easy thing to do.\n\n274\n00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.100\nIf they've just handed this to you and\n\n275\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.760\nyou've inherited the job, maybe it's\na little easier because hopefully,\n\n276\n00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.780\nsomeone's documented that and some of that\ngroundwork has been done, so you're good.\n\n277\n00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.900\nIf they're just laying\nthis out from scratch.\n\n278\n00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.420\nWhich this is something that they kind of\nlook at from the standpoint of the CASP is\n\n279\n00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.510\nthat, you're coming in and\n\n280\n00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.900\nthere's just a big pile of bricks there\nand you gotta build something out of it.\n\n281\n00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.919\nLegos, if you feel a little more playful.\n\n282\n00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:40.824\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you've got a bunch of stuff that,\n\n283\n00:15:40.824 --> 00:15:42.632\n[CROSSTALK] whatever,\nyou can get down to it.\n\n284\n00:15:42.632 --> 00:15:45.104\nTinkertoys, Erector Sets, whatever.\n\n285\n00:15:45.104 --> 00:15:48.426\nSo, they're kind of assuming\nthat you're coming in,\n\n286\n00:15:48.426 --> 00:15:52.682\nyou've got to do an assessment of where\nyou are and where you need to be.\n\n287\n00:15:52.682 --> 00:15:54.005\nSo how do you figure that out?\n\n288\n00:15:54.005 --> 00:15:58.719\nWell, there's numerous factors that\nare gonna go in As I like to say.\n\n289\n00:15:58.719 --> 00:16:02.773\nBut there's gonna be looking\nat business processes,\n\n290\n00:16:02.773 --> 00:16:07.190\nwhat information you process,\nwhat industry you're in.\n\n291\n00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:11.760\nWhat technology you have, as well as\nwhat type of doing a threat assessment,\n\n292\n00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.560\nthreat analysis.\n\n293\n00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.220\nThe types of risks and\nvulnerabilities, and and\n\n294\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.010\nall that type of stuff that's out there,\nyou're gonna be doing a lot\n\n295\n00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:22.040\nof stuff to figure out where you know,\nor what the world around you looks like.\n\n296\n00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.930\nYou already know what you got, you got\nsquat [LAUGH] there's nothing there,\n\n297\n00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:31.360\nthere's stuff that you can, you've got all\nthe blocks there and you guys gotta figure\n\n298\n00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.800\nout how you're gonna put them together to\nmake what your final solution's gonna look\n\n299\n00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.440\nlike or at least to the first stage\nyour solution's gonna look like.\n\n300\n00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.910\nSo you'll be obviously, I can't say you're\ngonna put all the security stuff together.\n\n301\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.960\nYou're gonna have that final solution for\n\n302\n00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.270\nsecurity because you never have\nthe final solution for security.\n\n303\n00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.180\nIt's gonna evolve.\n\n304\n00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.170\nIt's a living, breathing process.\n\n305\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.850\nYou're probably gonna step in\nat some part of that living,\n\n306\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.620\nbreathing process in the real world.\n\n307\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.990\nHere, you start from scratch, you do your\nassessment of what the world looks like,\n\n308\n00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.780\nwhere you are, what you already know.\n\n309\n00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.220\nNow you figure out where you need to\nbe by interpreting all that stuff.\n\n310\n00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.530\nIf we're gonna help you on it, I do not\nexpect unless you are working in a very\n\n311\n00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:13.440\nsmall area, field, or you're fortunate\nenough to not be as regulated,.\n\n312\n00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.800\nI do not expect you to be\ndoing that on your own.\n\n313\n00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.370\nI do expect you to be listening\nthose subject matter experts,\n\n314\n00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:23.270\nthose key stakeholders,\nI expect you to bring those people in.\n\n315\n00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.700\nSo once you have those things in place,\n\n316\n00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.290\nhey, you've got those subject matter\ninterpreted them, now okay, well,\n\n317\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:39.660\nI can start going through the process of\ninterpreting a specific goal into reality.\n\n318\n00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.560\nOnce I know what that reality is, and\n\n319\n00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.600\nwhat my final design has to look\nlike at that point in time.\n\n320\n00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.950\nNow, I can start going and playing with\nmy Lego's and making something happen.\n\n321\n00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:54.040\n>> That's where it goes, but\nit is gonna be a challenge.\n\n322\n00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.990\nIf you walk in at ground zero and\n\n323\n00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:01.340\nyou've got nothing established and\nyou've gotta build up from there.\n\n324\n00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.740\nIt sounds fun,\nbecause a lot of people look at it and\n\n325\n00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:09.110\nsay oh well heck, I want a blank\nslate because I'm gonna do it right.\n\n326\n00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:13.120\nDo you think the last guys said I'm\ngonna screw this up as royally as I can?\n\n327\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.050\nNo one says that, so\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n328\n00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.060\n>> You're gonna try to get it as right as\n\n329\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.080\npossible.\n\n330\n00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.160\nAnd do what you can and you're going\n\n331\n00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.280\nto be smart about it by getting ssubject\nmatter experts and all of those people\n\n332\n00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:30.420\ninvolved to get the best possible most\nefficient and well oiled solution.\n\n333\n00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.560\nBut you're going to realize that you\nmight be deficient on some stuff but\n\n334\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.870\nthat's where being flexible and being\nable to do audits and check to see where\n\n335\n00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:42.390\nyour efficient to be able to do change\nmanagement because you're going to go\n\n336\n00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.793\nthrough your design and realize oops, when\nI implemented this there's somebody did\n\n337\n00:18:45.793 --> 00:18:50.860\nan account for this I just realized when\nI started putting this thing together.\n\n338\n00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.808\nWell let's make a change\nright we're designing it.\n\n339\n00:18:53.808 --> 00:18:56.640\nWe'll submit that up the chain\nto the project lead.\n\n340\n00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.060\nHe knows the big picture.\n\n341\n00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.390\nAnd we'll say, yeah.\n\n342\n00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.370\nThat changed.\nYou can do that.\n\n343\n00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.310\nThat will not affect anything else.\n\n344\n00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.030\nIt won't have a big, far-reaching change.\n\n345\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.220\nIt will overall make everything efficient.\n\n346\n00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.280\nChange it, good.\n\n347\n00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.340\nThat's what a change manager\nprocess will help you with or\n\n348\n00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.040\none of the things it would help you with.\n\n349\n00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.100\nSo, you go through that.\n\n350\n00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.770\nYou make the best possible design\nyou can into your evaluations.\n\n351\n00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.460\nYou get it in place and good.\n\n352\n00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:23.000\nIf everything works out, you've got a very\neffective and efficient solution, but\n\n353\n00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.210\nyou will have deficiencies.\n\n354\n00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.930\nDo expect it, but everyone has them,\n\n355\n00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.460\nyou just try to minimize\nthem as much as possible.\n\n356\n00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.060\n>> And then communications I'm sure\nplays a big part in the success of our\n\n357\n00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.880\nenterprise security solution.\n\n358\n00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.470\nYes.\n\n359\n00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.770\nIt definitely does.\n\n360\n00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.620\nIf you.\n\n361\n00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.980\nCommunication, period.\n\n362\n00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:48.170\nIf you can't communicate openly and\n\n363\n00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:53.670\nstraightforward and\n[COUGH] do it an easy way.\n\n364\n00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.390\nYou're gonna have problems.\n\n365\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:59.290\nThat's something that\nreally plagues projects\n\n366\n00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.500\nis having a poor communications\nmechanism in place.\n\n367\n00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.460\nI've seen that happen and\n\n368\n00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:09.930\nit's just horrible when it happens,\nwhen you see that something that could\n\n369\n00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.125\nhave actually gone well just by\npeople opening their mouths or\n\n370\n00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:17.911\nsending emails saying something, there was\njust too many things that had to happen.\n\n371\n00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:20.785\nToo many people had to go through\nthe food chain, to go up and down and\n\n372\n00:20:20.785 --> 00:20:21.665\nget to someone else.\n\n373\n00:20:21.665 --> 00:20:25.130\nThere was an overly\ncomplicated process in place.\n\n374\n00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.390\nYou can't have that.\n\n375\n00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:33.230\nFor the systems that I work in and\nI've consulted on and\n\n376\n00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:38.920\ndone all that, I'm a big fan of just,\nhey, go over and go say something.\n\n377\n00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.690\nMake sure there's ultimately\ndocumentation but\n\n378\n00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.750\nif you're going to need to say something,\nit's quicker to go tell that person but\n\n379\n00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.140\nmake sure that is\ndocumented at some point.\n\n380\n00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.490\nTell the person that go ahead I'm\ngoing to send you an email on it but\n\n381\n00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.580\nI want to let you know that\nthis is going to be a problem.\n\n382\n00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.670\nYou're going to see an email\ncoming across in a little bit so\n\n383\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:56.650\nthat's a good way to do it.\n\n384\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.600\nBut I try to make sure the communication\nchannels are really streamlined.\n\n385\n00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.420\nI hate when they have\nthe large

couple levels up because even though\n\n388\n00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.010\nthat's the person that is gonna be able to\nanswer your question, and we all know it,\n\n389\n00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.280\nand that be the best person for you to\ngo to directly, you gotta go to me and\n\n390\n00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.790\nthen I got to go to my person and\nthat person goes to their person and\n\n391\n00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.750\nthen that person goes to the person you\nhad talked to in the first place and it'll\n\n392\n00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:30.550\ngo back down the chain to you and then\nyou'll talk to all these people yourself,\n\n393\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:36.190\nand then you'll get to this person.\n\n394\n00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.800\nLike, what the hell?\n\n395\n00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.700\nThat sounds a lot like the military.\n\n396\n00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.207\n>> [CROSSTALK] That's\nthe shit you gotta follow.\n\n397\n00:21:41.207 -->

00:21:53.230\nYou have to tell your chain, but come\nto me directly if you've got a problem.\n\n400\n00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.480\nBut it's not appropriate until you go back\nto whoever, but very rarely do I say no,\n\n401\n00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.970\nno I know you're asking a question,\nI can clearly answer,\n\n402\n00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:06.290\nI'm the best person to answer it, but no\ngo ask the guy, go ask your squad leader.\n\n403\n00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:07.390\nNo that ain't happening.\n\n404\n00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:15.655\nI just don't have any [LAUGH] any\nfavoritism or anything for that.\n\n405\n00:22:15.655 --> 00:22:17.695\nI'm the type that gets in trouble for\n\n406\n00:22:17.695 --> 00:22:21.515\njust going up, knocking on a door and\nsaying we've got to talk about something.\n\n407\n00:22:21.515 --> 00:22:22.915\nThey're like, did you talk to someone?\n\n408\n00:22:22.915 --> 00:22:24.835\nNo, talking to you first,\n\n409\n00:22:24.835 -->

and\n\n411\n00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:34.560\npositioning and ego to get in the way.\n\n412\n00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.730\nHey, everyone's got one, okay,\nyou're gonna get hurt but\n\n413\n00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.990\nwe need to get stuff done.\n\n414\n00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:44.110\nFor security, I'm big on that,\nI'm big on making things as clear and\n\n415\n00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:49.005\nconcise

talk to so and so,\nand so and so, and so and so.\n\n418\n00:22:56.065 --> 00:22:58.195\nWe can joke around about it, but\n\n419\n00:22:58.195 --> 00:23:03.465\nwhen you put it in the context of\nsecurity, all that time you're taking and\n\n420\n00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:08.685\nyou're wasting going all over the place\nand waiting for people to respond and\n\n421\n00:23:08.685 --> 00:23:13.010\nwaiting for people to bless something and\nall that I can't deal with that.\n\n422\n00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.870\nI can't have that because\nwhile you're doing that,\n\n423\n00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.220\nthat security problems getting worse.\n\n424\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.960\n>> By the time you responded to it,\nit doesn't matter, it's changed.\n\n425\n00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.290\nI've heard situations so bad,\nlike in IT side of stuff.\n\n426\n00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:29.850\nI remember being in one place where\nthey said, it was a huge, huge company.\n\n427\n00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.400\nAnd the way they set things up\njust to change group policy,\n\n428\n00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.140\nthere was a whole specific\nprocess to do that.\n\n429\n00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.623\nThe way they changed group policy is\nno one can do it there on that site.\n\n430\n00:23:40.623 --> 00:23:43.363\nThey had to submit something\nthrough channels that went all\n\n431\n00:23:43.363 --> 00:23:45.951\nthe way up to a committee that\ndidn't meet all the time.\n\n432\n00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:47.624\nAnd that committee would say,\nok, yeah that's good.\n\n433\n00:23:47.624 --> 00:23:49.714\nAnd then,\nthat committee would say Approved, and\n\n434\n00:23:49.714 --> 00:23:52.775\nit would go back down to the person\nsaying your policy has been approved, so\n\n435\n00:23:52.775 --> 00:23:54.400\ntalk to this person about creating it.\n\n436\n00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.000\nAnd that person would create it,\nthen it would go up and down and\n\n437\n00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.070\nfinally get to you.\n\n438\n00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:03.350\nAnd they said it was taking like two to\nthree months to get calls and change done.\n\n439\n00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.630\nThat's ridiculous,\nthat's stupid, it needs to stop.\n\n440\n00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.130\nIt just really needed to.\n\n441\n00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:11.290\nI'd be kicking down doors at that point,\ngoing this is dumb change it.\n\n442\n00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:12.770\nI can't deal with that.\n\n443\n00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.230\nYeah, someone could have already been,\nthat was a security related setting and\n\n444\n00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.510\nthat was critical.\n\n445\n00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.980\nSomeone's already in,\nthat's just no good anymore.\n\n446\n00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.780\nI mean this people said that,\nI was talking,\n\n447\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.380\nthere were in situations where by\nthe time I came back and approved and\n\n448\n00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:29.845\nhad the actual GPO created,\nthey said we don't need it anymore.\n\n449\n00:24:29.845 --> 00:24:32.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We don't, it's done.\n\n450\n00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.880\nWe found a way to work around it\nbecause we were clearly not gonna\n\n451\n00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.730\nbe able to respond in any\nreasonable amount of time.\n\n452\n00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.530\nSo you're trying to avoid that,\nyou don't have time for BS.\n\n453\n00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:47.530\nI need to have very quick response times,\nso I like to have\n\n454\n00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.710\nwhen you're making sure that these things\nabout communication happen for security,\n\n455\n00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:56.190\nI like to have people that we all know for\nsecurity problems to go directly to.\n\n456\n00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.990\nNotice, by the way, to kind of\nborrow stuff from our forensics and\n\n457\n00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.810\nother security-related topics.\n\n458\n00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:08.150\nOne of the things that I have said\nto you before in other, courses and\n\n459\n00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.670\nepisodes, stuff like that.\n\n460\n00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:14.890\nIs I have said that it's not uncommon\nto be in an organization where you have\n\n461\n00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:18.570\nIT and all these guys sittin' over here,\nand security's outside the food chain.\n\n462\n00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:22.650\nSecurity reports directly with the person\nat the top, or someone way up there.\n\n463\n00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.230\nSo, they compartmentalize them a lot.\n\n464\n00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:29.270\nAnd that has tremendous benefits because\nsomeone has a problem over here.\n\n465\n00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.800\nI can go, oh.\nThere's a security problem.\n\n466\n00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.420\nI know who to contact directly over here.\n\n467\n00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:33.630\nAnd so, I contact these people.\n\n468\n00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:37.020\nThese people get all crazy in IT or\nwhatever going, that was my issue,\n\n469\n00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:37.668\nI need to fix it.\n\n470\n00:25:37.668 --> 00:25:39.671\nSecurity problem,\n\n471\n00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:44.060\nthat if they said that it was not an IT\nproblem, they'd push it back over there.\n\n472\n00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.882\nBut, if I have any reason to suspect in\nany way, shape or form, it's a security\n\n473\n00:25:47.882 --> 00:25:51.531\nproblem, I'm going over here, and\nI push it over there, and if it's not,\n\n474\n00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:55.441\nI'll let them make the judgment call,\nyou don't get to make the judgment call.\n\n475\n00:25:55.441 --> 00:26:00.210\nI'm not gonna go say oh, well I've lost\nmy card, or I need a hazard reset.\n\n476\n00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:04.500\nYeah, IT is doing that, but if I've lost\nsomething, that's a security problem.\n\n477\n00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.310\nSo security needs to know, and then\nsecurity's gonna say we've logged it, and\n\n478\n00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.079\nnoted, and we saw what the problem is,\nand you just don't do it again.\n\n479\n00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.620\nI think kind of get the idea\nwith communication.\n\n480\n00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.970\nKeep it very simple.\n\n481\n00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.620\n>> Efficient, yeah, absolutely.\n\n482\n00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.930\n>> It's gotta be streamline.\n\n483\n00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:24.140\n>> We're starting to get a lot of\ninformation on integrating disciplines and\n\n484\n00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:28.550\nhow we can take advantage of that\nto help make sure we have a good\n\n485\n00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.920\nintegrated enterprise security.\n\n486\n00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.500\nAnything else we wanna put into this one?\n\n487\n00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.795\nWe're just about out of time.\n\n488\n00:26:33.795 --> 00:26:36.630\n>> I was looking here at the chat room,\n\n489\n00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:39.470\nit's like,\nI see some comments here on stuff.\n\n490\n00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.640\nMake sure others lower down the chain\nknow what's going on, that's a good one.\n\n491\n00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.890\nInformation, communicating,\nthat's a good point to point out, Roberto.\n\n492\n00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:52.830\nAnd I see, that always got here and\npeople may not wanna\n\n493\n00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.670\npass things up the food chain to\ncover their own behinds on that.\n\n494\n00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:03.470\nYeah, I don't know an effective fix for\nthat one.\n\n495\n00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.910\nBasically in those situations\ncommunication you're trying to do it\n\n496\n00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.410\nthe right way and it keeps running\nout of loggerhead or whatever there.\n\n497\n00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.810\nThen situations like that eventually\n\n498\n00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.560\nI give them a kind of three\nstrike type situation.\n\n499\n00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.760\nI'll tell you, I'll ask once, ask twice,\n\n500\n00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:23.550\nif I have to ask a third time I'm\ngonna go right over your head.\n\n501\n00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.770\nIf you get all upset\nI've gotta document it.\n\n502\n00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:26.880\nYou make sure it's documented.\n\n503\n00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.460\nI've gone over your head.\n\n504\n00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.620\nYou are not efficient,\nyou can't deal with it.\n\n505\n00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.170\nI'm done with you.\n\n506\n00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:33.080\nI'm not talking to you.\n\n507\n00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.170\nGo do whatever you're not doing.\n\n508\n00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.211\nCuz it's clearly not your job.\n\n509\n00:27:37.211 --> 00:27:38.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So go do that.\n\n510\n00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:42.830\nSo that's the way it is.\n\n511\n00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:43.810\n>> All right very good.\n\n512\n00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:47.381\nWell ladies and gentleman that's gonna do\nit for another episode here at ITProTV,\n\n513\n00:27:47.381 --> 00:27:48.770\nsigning off I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n514\n00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:49.792\n>> And I'm Sean Oryano.\n\n515\n00:27:49.792 --> 00:27:51.040\n>> And we'll see you

00:00:17.510\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and with me\ntoday is none other than Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.870\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.910\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.750\nHow you doing today?\n\n7\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.760\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.760\nExcited to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.319\nWe got another exciting episode\non our CompTIA Advanced\n\n10\n00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:26.906\nsecurity practitioner episode.\n\n11\n00:00:26.906 --> 00:00:31.669\nAnd this one Sean, you're talking about\nmanagement and management principles\n\n12\n00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.170\nbecause it is an important part of\nbeing a advanced security practitioner.\n\n13\n00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.560\n>> Yeah, it's a very, very big deal\nbecause of when you get to this point,\n\n14\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.630\nit's no longer, you're not really\njust playing around anymore.\n\n15\n00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.430\nYou are a manager.\n\n16\n00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.150\nYou're not just doing your own stuff or\nin charge of a couple people.\n\n17\n00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.490\nPresumably you're in charge of a much\nlarger team or teams as the case may be.\n\n18\n00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.690\nAnd helping them deal with their resources\nand time and money and all that.\n\n19\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.440\nYou're starting to get\ninto that sort of thing.\n\n20\n00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.230\nYou're still at the low to medium range in\n\n21\n00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.480\nthat area as far as managers go if\nyou want to put where they are.\n\n22\n00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.640\nSo to speak but you still have quite\na bit of responsibilities happening here.\n\n23\n00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.060\nThere's a lot that's under your control,\nthere's still stuff that isn't, but.\n\n24\n00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.780\nDoesn't mean that you don't have\nan important role to play in making\n\n25\n00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.840\nthings happen.\n\n26\n00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.440\n>> Yeah, and I think one of the first\nthings we wanna talk about is,\n\n27\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.660\nas a manager, making sure that\neverybody else works together and\n\n28\n00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.325\ndoes it in an effective and\nhopefully friendly way.\n\n29\n00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:39.820\n[LAUGH] Maybe that might not be so\nimportant, but.\n\n30\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.762\n>> Yeah, whatever,\nyou've got your goals, I've got mine.\n\n31\n00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:46.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, the collaborating and\n\n32\n00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.160\nmaking sure people work together,\nthat's a big part.\n\n33\n00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.100\nWe talked on a previous\nepisode about communication.\n\n34\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.180\nWithout effective communication you\ncan't even have the collaboration,\n\n35\n00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.610\nthat's got to be something that happens.\n\n36\n00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.080\nYou gotta have good, efficient,\nclean communications between people, so\n\n37\n00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.660\nthey feel they can freely express\nthings as much as possible.\n\n38\n00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.310\nSome things just aren't\nmeant to be shared.\n\n39\n00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.310\nBut when they need to, they know that\nthey can actually talk to one another and\n\n40\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.620\nget things to happen.\n\n41\n00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.880\nSo that's a big plus.\n\n42\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.990\nSomebody that's a less than stellar\nmanager's probably not going to\n\n43\n00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.950\npay attention to things, is not going to,\nis kind of going to say,\n\n44\n00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.090\nwell things will fall in line and just\nkind of go off and do their own thing.\n\n45\n00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.300\nI've seen that happen.\n\n46\n00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.030\nYou don't want the manager that is just\nnot paying attention to people's needs.\n\n47\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.960\nLet's say someone needed to go to\nJacksonville, or their feet hurt.\n\n48\n00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.150\nIf they don't pay attention to that.\n\n49\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.680\nIf I said I don't care you have\nto go to Jacksonville, and\n\n50\n00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.763\nit's all about me,\nthen that would be a bad manager.\n\n51\n00:02:45.763 --> 00:02:48.825\nA jerk.\n[LAUGH] Not that I've heard that any\n\n52\n00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:49.673\nplace before.\n\n53\n00:02:49.673 --> 00:02:50.993\n>> [LAUGH] For\n\n54\n00:02:50.993 --> 00:02:55.355\nthose of you not watching live you\nknow Sean is not a very good manager.\n\n55\n00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:57.095\n>> I don't claim it to be either.\n\n56\n00:02:57.095 --> 00:02:58.785\nThat's on my resume right there.\n\n57\n00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:01.225\nDon't hire as the manager.\n\n58\n00:03:01.225 --> 00:03:02.352\nYeah, I put that in.\n\n59\n00:03:02.352 --> 00:03:06.626\nYou can pay me like a manager but\nI don't want to have to be responsible for\n\n60\n00:03:06.626 --> 00:03:07.675\nanything.\n\n61\n00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:10.150\n>> Brings a lot of extra\nresponsibilities being a manager.\n\n62\n00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.310\n>> Yeah I don't need that.\n\n63\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.550\nI don't need that kind of stress.\n\n64\n00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.910\n>> So making sure that everybody's\ncommunicating effectively is a big part.\n\n65\n00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.986\nSo how do we go about doing that?\n\n66\n00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:25.650\nIs there any specifics?\n\n67\n00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.170\n>> There are ways you can approach this to\n\n68\n00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.190\nencourage people to collaborate and\nwork together.\n\n69\n00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.130\nOne of the things I've noticed\nthat is fundamental to making\n\n70\n00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.600\nthis happen is setting it up so people\njust aren't strangers to one another.\n\n71\n00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.620\nSo they realize that if they're not in\nthe same office seeing that person,\n\n72\n00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.209\nthat they're in another office, but\nthey're still part of the same team,\n\n73\n00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.080\nthey have a way to\ncommunicate with that person.\n\n74\n00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.550\nAnd one of the things I would say,\nif you want to bring people\n\n75\n00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.930\ntogether like that it would be\nif you're in another office,\n\n76\n00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.790\nsetting up maybe once, twice a month,\nor something, saying, okay,\n\n77\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.820\nyeah, you're in another office, if there's\na way to bring them all together, do that.\n\n78\n00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.865\nThere's a way to, if they can't do that,\n\n79\n00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:18.670\nthat's not practical then video\nconferencing would be a way to go.\n\n80\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.770\nThings like that are definitely going to\nhelp because when people aren't strangers\n\n81\n00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.960\nto one another they're more likely to\ntalk about things and make things happen.\n\n82\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.290\nSo we need to have that.\n\n83\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.920\nWe need to get rid of that kind\nof that lack of familiarity.\n\n84\n00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.180\nAnd think about that, that's kind\nof easier said than done because\n\n85\n00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.410\nyou think about the way it is nowadays.\n\n86\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.500\nAll the mobile stuff and people that\nare working out of their home or\n\n87\n00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.210\nwherever, you have offices that\nused to be a lot of people in it,\n\n88\n00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.600\nnow they're spread all over the place and\nback.\n\n89\n00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.460\nSo how are those people\ngoing to know one another.\n\n90\n00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.310\nThey're kind of just a bunch\nof strangers and names.\n\n91\n00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.110\nI want to do whatever I can\nto put face with those and\n\n92\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.630\nto let people who is doing what.\n\n93\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.350\nI don't want them guessing like hey,\nI've seen your name, you do what?\n\n94\n00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.230\nOh, yeah!\n\n95\n00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.010\nI've seen that type of stuff happen.\n\n96\n00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.315\nAnd it just, it's always funny as an\ninstructor I see people in classes that do\n\n97\n00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:10.208\nthat and where the company paid for\n\n98\n00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:13.471\ntwo people to come to the class\nare in the same department but\n\n99\n00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:17.283\nthey're in different offices and\ntheir on other sides of the state.\n\n100\n00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.569\nSo they come in and like oh it's good\nto finally put a face to you and\n\n101\n00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:20.855\nthey're shaking hands like well.\n\n102\n00:05:20.855 --> 00:05:22.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is the first,\n\n103\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.510\nhow long have you worked for this guy?\n\n104\n00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.820\nOh about 12 years.\n\n105\n00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.827\nThis is the first time you've met him,\nthat you know what the guy looks like?\n\n106\n00:05:28.827 --> 00:05:34.720\nAnd so it's something that you kinda\ngotta fix through good communication,\n\n107\n00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.940\nmaking sure people know who's responsible\nfor what and encouraging them to talk.\n\n108\n00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.510\nAlso finding ways,\n\n109\n00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.080\nI like to find when I give out projects,\nto give out projects in\n\n110\n00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.190\nsuch a way that that also encourages\nthem to start collaborating on it,\n\n111\n00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.320\nthat they're going to see that, hey to get\nthis done, you're gonna have to talk to so\n\n112\n00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.510\nand so to bring them in, because you\ndon't have all the pieces to it.\n\n113\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.610\nYou can't just do yours.\n\n114\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.440\nOr if they bring me\nthe part of the solution.\n\n115\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.400\nBut you talk to them.\n\n116\n00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.730\nThis doesn't look like it would fit in or\nwork the right way.\n\n117\n00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.630\nYou sure you verified this, right?\n\n118\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.550\nYou've given this to me.\n\n119\n00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.520\nThis is workable, right?\n\n120\n00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.140\nYou checked it.\n\n121\n00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:24.330\nSo those things is my gentle way of\nsaying talk to them, start sharing ideas.\n\n122\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.990\nMake teams start having,\nhave teams make meetings\n\n123\n00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.210\nwhere the key stakeholders exchange\ninformation if there's a group project or\n\n124\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.080\ngroup thing that's being worked on.\n\n125\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.600\nSo you're trying to do everything you\ncan to get them to work together and\n\n126\n00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.970\nto break down those barriers towards it.\n\n127\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.183\nFortunately, nowadays,\nfortunately or unfortunately,\n\n128\n00:06:47.183 --> 00:06:51.568\ndepending on how you kinda cut it,\ncommunication's easier.\n\n129\n00:06:51.568 --> 00:06:53.675\nBut just because\ncommunication's easier and\n\n130\n00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:56.753\nwe've got these devices with us that\nallow us to talk all the time and\n\n131\n00:06:56.753 --> 00:07:00.170\ndo whatever we want to and text and\nall that other stuff, it doesn't mean.\n\n132\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.370\nJust cuz I can text somebody or\ncall somebody,\n\n133\n00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.780\ndoesn't mean that's necessarily gonna\nfoster a strong bong between us.\n\n134\n00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.670\nWhat if all you've done is text somebody,\nor emailed them?\n\n135\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.830\nThat's not helping you.\n\n136\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.960\nThat's really not, to a certain\npoint that's just ineffective.\n\n137\n00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.660\nIt's a bigger challenge nowadays\nthan it used to be, but fortunately\n\n138\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.030\nif you use technology the right way,\nwe have plenty of ways to do it.\n\n139\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.912\nWe have online conferences we can do.\n\n140\n00:07:32.912 --> 00:07:36.650\nWe have video conferences that used\nto have the big expensive setups,\n\n141\n00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.660\nnow we have cameras in\njust about everything.\n\n142\n00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.610\nThere's really not too much of an excuse\nwhere someone can say I can't join a video\n\n143\n00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.481\nconference.\n\n144\n00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:49.936\nHow do you even work here with that\ncomputer that was shipped back in 2002?\n\n145\n00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:55.053\nBecause that's the last time I remember\nthem not having webcams with them.\n\n146\n00:07:55.053 --> 00:07:58.319\nThose type of things you're\ntrying to use in that way,\n\n147\n00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:01.163\nyou get people working\nmore closely together.\n\n148\n00:08:01.163 --> 00:08:04.593\nThey don't have to be together, they don't\nhave to be in the same office but they,\n\n149\n00:08:04.593 --> 00:08:06.900\nat least they're getting that connection,\nyou know.\n\n150\n00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.590\nAnd also knowing, getting them to collab,\nwhen you get them to collaborate,\n\n151\n00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.630\ngetting to know that,\nmaking sure they understand their ideas,\n\n152\n00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.040\nno matter what they are, they have value.\n\n153\n00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.810\nI may not use their ideas, but getting\nsomeone to bring their ideas to the table,\n\n154\n00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.410\nand creating an environment\nwhere it's constructive.\n\n155\n00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.690\nWhere it's like,\nokay that's actually a good idea,\n\n156\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.270\nit's just I'm not sure if\nthat's workable right now.\n\n157\n00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:37.610\nSays or maybe that's something that maybe\nwe can do some tweaks to it and adjust it,\n\n158\n00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:41.830\nand we can change just a bit and\nget something that's workable off that.\n\n159\n00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.440\nSo that was a good start,\ninstead of saying no that's a stupid idea,\n\n160\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.060\nthat won't work that way,\nyou don't know what you're talking about.\n\n161\n00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.010\nSaying hey, this is great.\n\n162\n00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.820\nI like the idea, explain it a bit more.\n\n163\n00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.940\nOkay, well, I'm not sure that's\na perfect fit for right now, says but.\n\n164\n00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.200\nHe says, but thanks for bringing it up.\n\n165\n00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.300\nMaybe not,\nthat might sound a little condescending,\n\n166\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.050\nbut you're trying to make sure they\nunderstand that their ideas have value.\n\n167\n00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:08.690\nAnd all those things will encourage\ncollaboration and make things work better.\n\n168\n00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.070\nThe way I see it,\n\n169\n00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:15.920\nI don't want to lose that collaboration\nbecause team cohesiveness breaks down.\n\n170\n00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.330\nIdeas start breaking down.\n\n171\n00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.820\nThings don't happen.\n\n172\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.260\nYou start getting an adversarial\nrelationship where people on different\n\n173\n00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.300\nteams become it's us against them.\n\n174\n00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.010\nI don't want that.\n\n175\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.100\nThis isn't like the NFL or NHL.\n\n176\n00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.090\nThere's not a bunch of teams\nthat are battling it out for\n\n177\n00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.630\npoints in the standings,\nthat are working together.\n\n178\n00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.980\nSo that could be tough, but\nthere's ways you can do it.\n\n179\n00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.790\nI don't encourage, I know some places do,\nand I don't encourage those team\n\n180\n00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.000\nbuilding things where they go\nout in the field and run around.\n\n181\n00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.860\nI've seen that.\n\n182\n00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.530\nIf you wanna do that, your call.\n\n183\n00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.801\nI, quite frankly,\nthink they suck when they do that.\n\n184\n00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:50.711\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n185\n00:09:50.711 --> 00:09:51.505\n>> They're like hey,\n\n186\n00:09:51.505 --> 00:09:54.478\nput the blindfold on, or catch me when\nI fall backwards or something like.\n\n187\n00:09:54.478 --> 00:09:57.230\n>> No, no ain't happening.\n\n188\n00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.500\n>> You would drop me, wouldn't you?\n\n189\n00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.410\nYou'd let me fall.\n\n190\n00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.380\n>> Yea I'd be like I wanted\nyou to learn about gravity.\n\n191\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.549\nI'm trying to encourage you\nto further your learning.\n\n192\n00:10:05.549 --> 00:10:10.560\n>> [LAUGH] All right, another big thing\nthat we need to worry about especially\n\n193\n00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.510\nwhen we're in that\nmanagement level is change.\n\n194\n00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.730\nChange can throw a big\nwrench in our plans.\n\n195\n00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.610\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n196\n00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.730\nChange is one of those things\nthat depending on who you talk to\n\n197\n00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.790\nit's a good thing or it's a bad thing.\n\n198\n00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.690\nChange is just that.\n\n199\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.640\nIt's something that happens.\n\n200\n00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.050\nAnd there's going to be\nsome result of that change.\n\n201\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.290\nFor every action, an equal and\nopposite reaction so.\n\n202\n00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.090\nSame type of deal, you make a change,\nthere's going to be something coming out\n\n203\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.060\nthe back end that you're\ngoing to have to deal with.\n\n204\n00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:46.400\nSo what you want to do, is you want\nto be able to get a good gauge on\n\n205\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:52.510\nthe experience and modeling what\nthe end result be, or it could be.\n\n206\n00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.500\nTo kind of try to predict that.\n\n207\n00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.050\nHave people that have experience as well,\nhave their input on it.\n\n208\n00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.530\nSay okay,\nthis is the change being proposed.\n\n209\n00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.540\nWhat do you think?\n\n210\n00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.020\nAnd it's an extension of\nthe basic change manager process\n\n211\n00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.570\nwhere you have someone look at something,\nmake a proposal.\n\n212\n00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:14.430\nIt goes through the approval process, and,\nif it's blessed, it's developed, tested,\n\n213\n00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.730\nand implemented.\n\n214\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.910\nAnd all that good stuff, but\nwhat you're doing here is,\n\n215\n00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.020\nyou're now bringing it up to\na large organization level.\n\n216\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.340\nYou have different groups, and now what\nwe're doing is, we're trying to say, okay,\n\n217\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.240\nthat team and that team,\nthese guys are all working together, and\n\n218\n00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.960\nthey make a change, so we gotta make\nsure there's a way they can communicate,\n\n219\n00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.970\nor collaborate, to use that again.\n\n220\n00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.830\nThat they can say,\nwell these guys make a change.\n\n221\n00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.440\nThey're all collaborating.\n\n222\n00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.010\nThey're comfortable talking\nto one another so they can,\n\n223\n00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.620\nthis person wants to make a change.\n\n224\n00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.650\nHas gone through the process.\n\n225\n00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.160\nBut they've realized that\nmaybe their software project,\n\n226\n00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.790\nit's a call tracking system or\na voiceover IP systems.\n\n227\n00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:57.500\nYou pick something that's organizational\nwide, and what happens is that when they\n\n228\n00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:02.250\nmake a change they realize the change they\nhave is gonna since the system goes across\n\n229\n00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:07.130\nthe different disciplines, different\ndepartments that they need to get input\n\n230\n00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:11.860\nand sign off from the other groups\nto say okay this will happen.\n\n231\n00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.480\nAnd this is fine.\n\n232\n00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.920\nThe important thing to remember.\n\n233\n00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.600\nDefinitely an important thing to remember.\n\n234\n00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.890\nIt's not something you want to skimp on.\n\n235\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.770\n>> And then of course, if we're\ntalking about within our organization,\n\n236\n00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.650\nand that's gonna probably magnify it.\n\n237\n00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.210\nWe start talking about between\nmultiple organizations,\n\n238\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.658\nespecially if they're\ndifferent industries.\n\n239\n00:12:28.658 --> 00:12:30.049\n>> Ouch.\n[LAUGH]\n\n240\n00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:31.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n241\n00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.450\n>> That can get even nastier because\n\n242\n00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:39.300\nthe thing we've been emphasizing here\nis communication and collaboration.\n\n243\n00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.695\nThat's all well and good, and\n\n244\n00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:48.765\nit works well if you really go about it\nthe right way, within an organization.\n\n245\n00:12:48.765 --> 00:12:51.225\nBecause that organization is\nprobably all in the same industry.\n\n246\n00:12:51.225 --> 00:12:55.747\nThere are organizations that go\nacross industries themselves.\n\n247\n00:12:55.747 --> 00:13:00.277\nBut we'll assume that the organization we\nhave, they're all in the same industry.\n\n248\n00:13:00.277 --> 00:13:04.297\nPeople are still paddling the same\ndirection, so overall, you should have\n\n249\n00:13:04.297 --> 00:13:10.198\na little easier time of unifying vision\nand ideas and goals and all that.\n\n250\n00:13:10.198 --> 00:13:13.488\nBut, once I start bringing in\nstuff like contractors and\n\n251\n00:13:13.488 --> 00:13:15.708\nI'm working with an industry\nthat different from mine.\n\n252\n00:13:15.708 --> 00:13:20.960\nThat is something that needs, that I\nneed to bring in to bear on my project.\n\n253\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.330\nThat changes things.\n\n254\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.310\nAnd that changes things, I'm not going\nto say for the bad or for the worst.\n\n255\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.110\nI'm just going to say\nit does change things.\n\n256\n00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:32.430\nBecause now you've got a different\nlanguage you've gotta speak.\n\n257\n00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.950\nYou have to learn their limitations and\ntheir benefits and\n\n258\n00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:37.180\nthey have to learn yours.\n\n259\n00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.170\nTheir security departments\nhave got to be exchanged,\n\n260\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.150\nthat document exchange we talked about.\n\n261\n00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.800\nThere has to be SLAs established\non who's responsible for what.\n\n262\n00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.460\nAll those things needs to be done.\n\n263\n00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.790\nSo there's a lot of difficulties\nthat come into play.\n\n264\n00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.570\nAnd I mean heck, those difficulties and\nchallenges come into play even if you have\n\n265\n00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:59.073\na company that's worked with somebody\nin the same industry on the outside.\n\n266\n00:13:59.073 --> 00:14:02.830\nI mean.\nYou guys know how it is if you're trying\n\n267\n00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.250\nto setup communication uplinks and\nstuff like that for a company, and\n\n268\n00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.910\nyou got to go to, I'm not picking on any\nspecific company but if you got to go to\n\n269\n00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:16.130\nlike AT&T or Verizon or whoever to have\nthem bring a connection in so you can talk\n\n270\n00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:20.120\nto the rest of the world, the Internet,\nand do that type of stuff all right.\n\n271\n00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.200\nWe know the problems that happened\nwith that, with you know calling them,\n\n272\n00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:23.990\nthis is the problem.\n\n273\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.985\nWill you do this, no that's on your side,\nno that's on this side.\n\n274\n00:14:26.985 --> 00:14:32.040\nYou know all sorts of nonsense can go\ndown at that point so we've seen it but\n\n275\n00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.701\nthey can be overcome as long as everyone\nknows what they're supposed to be doing,\n\n276\n00:14:36.701 --> 00:14:37.760\nwhere they fit in and\n\n277\n00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:43.600\nthey can communicate in such a way that\nthey understand where each other is.\n\n278\n00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.050\nYou know so there could be a lot of\nchallenges there but it doesn't mean it\n\n279\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:51.880\nneeds to be a barrier, a wall to stop\nyou from proceeding any further.\n\n280\n00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.590\nIt means that it can be a speed bump\nwhich a lot of cases it is a speed bump.\n\n281\n00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.770\nThere's a bump in the road\nyou gotta deal with.\n\n282\n00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.800\nOkay, I can deal with that.\n\n283\n00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.110\nI can deal with a bump\nin the road you know.\n\n284\n00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.710\nThat's what it is and\nI can minimize, it's never,\n\n285\n00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:10.370\nyou never have two industries that\nmeet up and, it's a nice handshake and\n\n286\n00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.430\ngentlemanly agreement and\nthey move on you know, and no problems.\n\n287\n00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.250\nBut it doesn't work that way.\n\n288\n00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.450\nThere's gonna be some bump in there,\n\n289\n00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.180\nthere's gonna be things that you don't\nexpect, because there's differences,\n\n290\n00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:26.590\ndifferences in a way you do thing there,\nbut bump in the road, yeah you can with.\n\n291\n00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.720\nJust how big of a bump\nare you going to have?\n\n292\n00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.210\n>> Yeah, cuz I mean you talk\nabout different industries,\n\n293\n00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:33.360\nthere's different regulations in\nplace that we have to deal with.\n\n294\n00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.120\nI can't imagine the fun and\njoys of dealing with that.\n\n295\n00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.476\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n296\n00:15:38.476 --> 00:15:44.190\nThat's the type of stuff that makes\nthings interesting, and you see it,\n\n297\n00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:49.723\nyou have stuff that that comes together\nin really creative interesting\n\n298\n00:15:49.723 --> 00:15:54.723\nways that you'd be kind of just\nhow did those two come together?\n\n299\n00:15:54.723 --> 00:15:57.593\nHow are those guys gonna work together?\n\n300\n00:15:57.593 --> 00:16:02.514\nYou think about stuff like,\none that comes to mind because\n\n301\n00:16:02.514 --> 00:16:07.436\nI've seen this is the helicopters\nthey bring into air lift\n\n302\n00:16:07.436 --> 00:16:13.780\nthe medical people out from\na really bad accident or something.\n\n303\n00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.190\nThose guys are pretty much set up\nto land just about anywhere they\n\n304\n00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.390\nneed to as long as it's safe.\n\n305\n00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:23.510\nThe stuff that they do, other helicopters\ncannot do that type of stuff.\n\n306\n00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.470\nThey have the ability to do it,\nbut they're not allowed.\n\n307\n00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.939\nYou see these guys land in places where\nthey don't have much clearance on\n\n308\n00:16:30.939 --> 00:16:35.250\ntelephone wires and stuff like that,\npower lines and all that.\n\n309\n00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.630\nThey're just bringing it right in.\n\n310\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.840\nThat would strictly not be\nallowed under most conditions.\n\n311\n00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.010\nThe FAA would say you do that and\nyou will not be taking off again.\n\n312\n00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.660\nThey could come down on you pretty hard.\n\n313\n00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:51.767\nYou'll get arrested and all those sorts of\nstuff and maybe get your license pulled.\n\n314\n00:16:51.767 --> 00:16:56.795\nOn the other side too, they could go easy\non you sometimes, but it all depends.\n\n315\n00:16:56.795 --> 00:17:00.219\nBut you look at it, we've got the medical\nstuff with their own regs on how\n\n316\n00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:03.520\nthey've got to deal with stuff,\nand then we've got the FAA.\n\n317\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.790\nThose two got to talk to make that\nservice work, and that's only part of it.\n\n318\n00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.700\nNow you're talking county, and state and\ncertifications and stuff like that.\n\n319\n00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.850\nPlus, the training that those guys have\ngot to have, the people that are flying\n\n320\n00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:18.950\nthat chopper and working at the back,\nthose people are trained to be\n\n321\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.870\nair crew stuff and they're and\nhow to be safe on their deal with that,\n\n322\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.040\nit's not an ambulance,\na normal ambulance that they're in.\n\n323\n00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.070\nThey've got to know how to do in air\nstuff and how to be safe on that\n\n324\n00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:35.020\nplus do the medical side of stuff and\nbe aware of other things on top of that.\n\n325\n00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.950\nSo there's a lot of disciplines\ncoming together to make that work.\n\n326\n00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.000\nHowever, someone has thought it out and\nlooked at how they all came together and\n\n327\n00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.795\nwho is responsible for what,\nand it works really well,\n\n328\n00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:50.395\nthey do have problems, but\nnot nearly as much as you would think.\n\n329\n00:17:51.595 --> 00:17:54.165\n>> And then I guess the other thing we've\nalways got to consider anytime we're\n\n330\n00:17:54.165 --> 00:17:58.035\ndealing with business is going\nto be mergers, acquisitions, and\n\n331\n00:17:58.035 --> 00:18:00.446\npossibly splitting the company as well.\n\n332\n00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:04.270\n>> Yeah, that's going to be the other\nside of it, they, and just for\n\n333\n00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.690\nthe record I like the term splitting too.\n\n334\n00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:12.840\nThe term I put on my notes\nhere was de-mergers for it.\n\n335\n00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.770\nThat's a horrible term.\n\n336\n00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.730\n>> I've seen that term in the books and\nI'm not a huge fan of it.\n\n337\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.860\nBut I know what it means,\nI understand the point of it, but yeah.\n\n338\n00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.810\n>> Someone made that up, just to like,\n\n339\n00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:28.690\nI'm sure CompT is like we can't use\nsplitting up or breaking up a company.\n\n340\n00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:33.610\nCall it demerger and we'll trademark it so\nno one else can use it.\n\n341\n00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:34.530\n>> There you go.\n\n342\n00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.510\nA lot of things to consider if\nwe're merging two companies.\n\n343\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.160\nAgain, they might be from\ndifferent industries,\n\n344\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.580\ndifferent regulations or\nthey just have a different security plan.\n\n345\n00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:44.800\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n346\n00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.490\nIf we take out you take out the different\nindustries stuff and things like that,\n\n347\n00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.350\nalso related to that and you just look\nat the security plan like you said.\n\n348\n00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:59.023\nI can pretty much count on the fact\nthat they don't have the exact same\n\n349\n00:18:59.023 --> 00:19:06.063\nsecurity planning, and they may have close\nand then bringing those things together.\n\n350\n00:19:06.063 --> 00:19:09.614\nAnyone here viewing this or\nhas either dealt with or\n\n351\n00:19:09.614 --> 00:19:14.653\nknows somebody that dealt with just\nbringing the networks and different\n\n352\n00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:20.618\nmanagement structures of the two companies\ntogether, they know what a pain that is.\n\n353\n00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:23.830\n>> If you've ever had two\ndifferent jobs in the same field.\n\n354\n00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.350\nThink about the differences\nbetween those two jobs.\n\n355\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.340\nWhile these guys did it one way, these\nguys do it a completely different way,\n\n356\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.730\naccomplishing the same things in the end,\nbut a completely different way handling,\n\n357\n00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.310\nbecause we have all those, Shawn's been\nover all these different choices of\n\n358\n00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.810\nwhat protocols we want to use,\nhow we want to implement this.\n\n359\n00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.400\nNo two people chose the same thing and\n\n360\n00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.355\nnow we got to merge them together,\ngot to pick one solution, right?\n\n361\n00:19:44.355 --> 00:19:48.040\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd it can be very tricky.\n\n362\n00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.040\nFortunately, there’s a lot of best\npractices and guidelines out there for\n\n363\n00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.580\ndoing this, but\nthey’re only going to get you so far.\n\n364\n00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.310\nYou do have to consult with experts and\nstuff like that.\n\n365\n00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.020\nAnd the larger the company gets,\nthe larger the problem’s going to be.\n\n366\n00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:00.890\nYou see it.\n\n367\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:05.280\nThere's really no company\nin the history of ever\n\n368\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:08.210\nthat's in enterprise level especially.\n\n369\n00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.490\nThey've never said oh, we're merging,\nand it's done, let's go.\n\n370\n00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:13.460\nIt doesn't happen.\n\n371\n00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:17.920\nThey may act like we're one big happy\nfamily with a wink and nod, they aren't.\n\n372\n00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.860\nYou go behind the scenes, they've got\nsomeone holding the roll of duct tape, and\n\n373\n00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.890\nthey're sticking stuff all together,\nand that's about what it is.\n\n374\n00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.290\nThey're trying to hold\nthe thing together and\n\n375\n00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:31.550\nmake people think it's actually working.\n\n376\n00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:36.440\nEventually, it does, everything kind\nof blends in, but it does take awhile.\n\n377\n00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.000\nThe one I think of whenever\nI hear the term mergers,\n\n378\n00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.010\nnowadays I think of the airline industry.\n\n379\n00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.150\nI mean, think of the airline industry,\n\n380\n00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:48.090\neven after they approved\nthe FTC here in the US.\n\n381\n00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.630\nWe'll say the Federal Trade Commission\nsays okay,\n\n382\n00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:54.410\nthere's no harm to the customer and\nthese guys can merge.\n\n383\n00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:58.920\nWhen they merged those ones,\nthey say, okay,\n\n384\n00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.310\nyou guys have been approved,\nyou can be one airline now.\n\n385\n00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.180\nYeah, you're one airline, but it can take-\n>> In name.\n\n386\n00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.195\n>> Yeah, in name.\n\n387\n00:21:07.195 --> 00:21:11.859\nYou're under one banner, but\nfor awhile you'll see the other\n\n388\n00:21:11.859 --> 00:21:16.175\nairlines planes still flying\nwith they're livery on it.\n\n389\n00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:21.145\nYou'll see, when you go to an airport,\nyou'll see that one airlines terminal and\n\n390\n00:21:21.145 --> 00:21:26.195\nthen you see the other airlines air craft\nparking and you're like what's going on?\n\n391\n00:21:26.195 --> 00:21:30.592\nIt's the same airline and they're\nslowly merging, because they've got to\n\n392\n00:21:30.592 --> 00:21:34.379\nintegrate all those operations and\nanalyze which ones they need,\n\n393\n00:21:34.379 --> 00:21:37.623\nwhich positions they need,\nwhich ones they can retain,\n\n394\n00:21:37.623 --> 00:21:41.369\nwhich ones they can get rid of,\nwhich ones need to be repurposed.\n\n395\n00:21:41.369 --> 00:21:46.077\nThere's a lot that goes into it, and\nsome of these places they talk at least\n\n396\n00:21:46.077 --> 00:21:49.388\n18 to 24 months to get\nanything that's decent.\n\n397\n00:21:49.388 --> 00:21:53.007\nI mean, stuff that on the outside,\nif you don't know what's going on behind\n\n398\n00:21:53.007 --> 00:21:56.572\nthe scenes, stuff that's on the outside\nthat looks to you it's like well,\n\n399\n00:21:56.572 --> 00:21:58.150\nwhy can't they integrate it?\n\n400\n00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:02.720\nI've heard people complaining that when\na couple big airlines like the legacy\n\n401\n00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:09.210\ncarriers, these big huge airlines,\nthey'll say well, they become one\n\n402\n00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:14.710\nairline 18 months ago, why can't I\nhave the same frequent flyer program?\n\n403\n00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.600\nI go on both of them,\nwhy do I have two numbers?\n\n404\n00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.060\nThis is stupid,\nthey don't have their act together.\n\n405\n00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.780\nYou have no idea what's\ngoing on behind the scenes.\n\n406\n00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.630\nThat's like the low priority stuff.\n\n407\n00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.530\nYeah, it sucks if you're\nthe one in that situation.\n\n408\n00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:31.200\nYou got two numbers, you got two numbers\nto manage but don't get that together.\n\n409\n00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.300\nThey go a lot of other stuff\nthey've got to take care of first,\n\n410\n00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.200\nlike getting all the flight\nmanagement systems and\n\n411\n00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.830\nall that all working together\nbetween the two airlines.\n\n412\n00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.475\nIt's a big, big project, and\n\n413\n00:22:44.475 --> 00:22:49.435\n18 to 24 months just means that you've\ngot stuff working reasonably well.\n\n414\n00:22:49.435 --> 00:22:54.675\nIt could be years after that before\nyou've got anything that's even\n\n415\n00:22:54.675 --> 00:22:58.080\nclose to any normalcy.\n\n416\n00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.860\nI remember, to just kind of expand on\nthat idea, I remember American Airlines\n\n417\n00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.180\nbought an airlines called Reno Air and\nthey also bought one called Air Cal.\n\n418\n00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.720\nThey bought those ones, Reno Air\naircraft for example were kind of,\n\n419\n00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.050\nthey weren't unsafe to fly or anything,\nbut they were showing to their age.\n\n420\n00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:18.740\nI mean, they perfectly fine,\ncertified to fly, no problem with it, but\n\n421\n00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.830\nyou kind of knew even though they were\npandering to American Airlines, you know,\n\n422\n00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.390\nthe red, white, and\nblue and all that on there.\n\n423\n00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.144\nYou still knew when you got on these\nplanes, like American Airlines didn't buy\n\n424\n00:23:28.144 --> 00:23:31.740\nthis stuff, this is a Reno Air one they\njust said yeah we'll just repaint it and\n\n425\n00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.590\ndo this stuff, you see those\nsorts of things because you would\n\n426\n00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:38.740\nsee a little more wear, visible wear\non that, nothing just cosmetic stuff.\n\n427\n00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.380\nBut you'd see it and stuff, see the carpet\nkind of shredding some corners, but\n\n428\n00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.360\nyou'd see it.\n\n429\n00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:49.709\nBut not a big deal, but if you knew what\nyou were looking for you would see that.\n\n430\n00:23:49.709 --> 00:23:54.334\nYou saw those aircraft in the year for\nanother 10 to 15 years after the merger.\n\n431\n00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:57.108\nThey were still airborne\nbecause they got refurbished.\n\n432\n00:23:57.108 --> 00:24:00.266\nThey were checked out and everything and\nwere totally fine, but After a while they\n\n433\n00:24:00.266 --> 00:24:04.150\nsaid, okay, yeah, we're betting to get new\naircraft, we don't need those anymore.\n\n434\n00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.290\nAnd then you see another one,\n\n435\n00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:13.450\nUS Airways in the United States,\nthey bought up several airlines.\n\n436\n00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.170\nThey bought up America West,\nthey got PSA and\n\n437\n00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.420\nbunch of other ones, big airlines,\nthey just gobbled them up.\n\n438\n00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:24.040\nAnd they were an example of,\nnot to pick on them or anything, but\n\n439\n00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.270\nthey're an example of they grew\nincredibly fast, you know?\n\n440\n00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.940\nThey bought other airlines\nwho were having issues.\n\n441\n00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.800\nThey bought incredibly fast.\n\n442\n00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:37.360\nThey were one of those things where, from\nthe outside everything looks, it's like,\n\n443\n00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:42.360\nwe're good, we're ready, we're here for\nyour business, we're good and all that.\n\n444\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.232\nAnd behind the scenes,\nsomeone's like they're holding.\n\n445\n00:24:44.232 --> 00:24:47.195\n[INAUDIBLE] And they're going I don't\nknow if I can hold this any longer.\n\n446\n00:24:47.195 --> 00:24:47.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So they're,\n\n447\n00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.590\ndon't know what they are doing, cuz they\nhad stuff just go all over the place.\n\n448\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.470\nThey didn't have enough\ncustomer service people.\n\n449\n00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.220\nThe systems weren't scaling up because\nthey had all these different flight\n\n450\n00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.420\nsystems and\n\n451\n00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.380\ncustomer systems and reservation\nsystems that were all over the place.\n\n452\n00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.290\nYou'd call for reservations and you\ncould hear them going between different\n\n453\n00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:05.803\nsystems-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n454\n00:25:05.803 --> 00:25:06.370\n>> And then they were like,\n\n455\n00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.150\nhey wait a minute I've got\nto switch over to this one.\n\n456\n00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:13.060\nIt, took in some of those cases took,\nI know for the reservation, I remember it\n\n457\n00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:18.180\nwas about three years at least before,\nafter the last set of mergers before they\n\n458\n00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:23.210\nactually got everything all you know at\nleast cleared up and they just merged with\n\n459\n00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:28.250\nanother extremely large airline, they just\nmerged recently with American Airlines.\n\n460\n00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:33.150\nAmerican Airlines has been one or\ntwo for a long time and so they just got\n\n461\n00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.250\ngobbled up by them so they got even bigger\nso they just dealt with those problems and\n\n462\n00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.310\nthey're like you know\nthey got scaled up again.\n\n463\n00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.400\nAnother whole order of magnitude, but\n\n464\n00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.240\nit shows when you look at getting\nto see in those industries that by\n\n465\n00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.480\nstudying those things you can see the\ntypes of issues you're gonna have to face.\n\n466\n00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.810\nYou have a tremendous\namount of moving parts,\n\n467\n00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:55.340\nyou've got that tens of thousands\nof employees work at those things,\n\n468\n00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:00.440\nand all of the computerized stuff and\neverything, that's a huge challenge.\n\n469\n00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.560\nYou can imagine, from a management\nstandpoint, what that would do to you.\n\n470\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.180\nYou wouldn't be going and\ndealing with it either.\n\n471\n00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.583\nYou'd be a crazy if you think they're\nthe only one dealing with it,\n\n472\n00:26:07.583 --> 00:26:09.015\nyou would never do that.\n\n473\n00:26:09.015 --> 00:26:13.230\nSo, a big thing, a lot of people\ntalking all over the place.\n\n474\n00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.950\nThere's so many different layers\nof stuff going on and then to\n\n475\n00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:21.070\ntake it to the other side, we've got the\nmerger and acquisition, the M&A activity.\n\n476\n00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.390\nThen you go to the other side,\nthe splitting up.\n\n477\n00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:26.570\nThe splitting up, to extricate and\n\n478\n00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:32.460\nunwind a company, have one company give\nbirth to another is the way I look at it.\n\n479\n00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.150\nThat can be something that's\nextremely challenging as well.\n\n480\n00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.270\nBecause what's gonna be theirs,\n\n481\n00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:45.390\nwhat are they gonna take with them when\nthey get spun off, what's gonna stay here?\n\n482\n00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.560\nWhat are both sides missing and\nneed to be replicated?\n\n483\n00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.100\nHow long are they going to\nhave that umbilical cord\n\n484\n00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.600\nbetween them before it's finally cut?\n\n485\n00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:01.980\nIt could be a tremendous challenge\non how that's going to work.\n\n486\n00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.960\nI've seen both of those events,\nboth the situations happen.\n\n487\n00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.320\nI've seen the airline stuff happen,\n\n488\n00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.950\nI've seen stuff in the software\nindustry happen both ways.\n\n489\n00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.960\nHeck, I saw one where\na company I was with,\n\n490\n00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.400\nwhen the Internet became popular,\nwhat they did was they said,\n\n491\n00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.210\nwe're gonna start up a division that\nspecifically deals with Internet stuff,\n\n492\n00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:26.740\nand he says we're gonna spin\nthat off as its own thing.\n\n493\n00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:30.420\nAnd what they did is they spun it off and\nbecame the investors in that.\n\n494\n00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.740\nSo they basically owned enough\nof it where they still owned it,\n\n495\n00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.660\neven though it was a separate entity.\n\n496\n00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.090\nSo they spun it off and did all this\nstuff to say it's a separate thing.\n\n497\n00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.190\nIt was only about three,\nfour years later they said you know,\n\n498\n00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.890\nit's a stupid decision.\n\n499\n00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:42.460\nBuy it back.\n\n500\n00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.481\nAnd they brought it over here.\n\n501\n00:27:43.481 --> 00:27:45.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they went over and grabbed it.\n\n502\n00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.050\nSo they had to spun it off and\nthen re-merge it back in.\n\n503\n00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:52.670\nAnd it was interesting, because you\nhad people that got spun off, and\n\n504\n00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:57.510\nhad everything from the business\ncards on down changed.\n\n505\n00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.940\nAnd systems given rise to, and broken off.\n\n506\n00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.557\nAnd all the sudden, yeah, bring it back\nit back over here, we're just kidding.\n\n507\n00:28:03.557 --> 00:28:07.095\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's rare, but\n\n508\n00:28:07.095 --> 00:28:10.602\nit does actually happen.\n\n509\n00:28:10.602 --> 00:28:14.024\nIt's not as common to see that kind\nof hokey pokey going on, [LAUGH] but\n\n510\n00:28:14.024 --> 00:28:16.089\nI assure you, it does happen, and heck,\n\n511\n00:28:16.089 --> 00:28:19.590\nthat's not even bringing in what\nthe government can do to you.\n\n512\n00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.690\nA government can bring a whole\nnew level of complexity, and\n\n513\n00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:27.600\nit's stuff that makes the stuff we dealt\nwith sound not as bad, or actually,\n\n514\n00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.330\nwith all the complexity and craziness,\nit makes that stuff look normal.\n\n515\n00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:36.120\nI saw one where the government\nactually mandated over here,\n\n516\n00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.770\nthis was the company that I\nwas with that actually said,\n\n517\n00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:43.900\nthe company I was with,\nwe owed a multimedia division,\n\n518\n00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.335\nand they said we wanted to buy\na multimedia division up in Canada.\n\n519\n00:28:48.335 --> 00:28:54.720\nIt was up in Montreal, they wanted to\nbuy that one, and so the FTC came in and\n\n520\n00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.620\nsaid, no, you can't buy them, because you\nalready have a multimedia division, so\n\n521\n00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.320\nthat's decreasing competitiveness\nin the marketplace.\n\n522\n00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.930\nSo people in the company were saying oh,\nwe can't buy them,\n\n523\n00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.610\nwe're not allowed to buy them,\nbecause it's being blocked\n\n524\n00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.790\nthey found a creative solution\nthat the government signed off on.\n\n525\n00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.960\nThe creative solution was they had to let\n\n526\n00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.360\nthe other company up in Montreal buy\nour company's multimedia division,\n\n527\n00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.930\nthen we bought the other one,\n[LAUGH] and then bought them anyway.\n\n528\n00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.530\nSame end result, but it was like oh, yeah,\n\n529\n00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:30.270\nyou got rid of yours and let them buy it,\nokay, so That's not a problem,\n\n530\n00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.180\nand then you buy them, yeah,\nokay, that works, we'll do that.\n\n531\n00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.220\nYou just kinda scratch your head.\n\n532\n00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:40.140\nI remember at the time when I was there,\nand I'm like, they did what now?\n\n533\n00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:40.950\nWhy did they do that?\n\n534\n00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.690\nYou know that's stupid, right?\n\n535\n00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:46.850\n[LAUGH] It's like you just change\nthe order and that's okay,\n\n536\n00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:53.060\nto me that's like going,\nyeah one plus two plus one equals four but\n\n537\n00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.040\nif we changed the order you know\none plus one plus two equals five.\n\n538\n00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.483\nIt's the same thing you're doing\nthe same thing and you know it [LAUGH].\n\n539\n00:30:01.483 --> 00:30:05.840\n>> Well Shawn a lot of great information\nthere on management principles and\n\n540\n00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:11.770\ndealing with some of the changes that\noccur in management, mergers, demergers.\n\n541\n00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:16.390\nAs well as making sure that we have good,\neffective communications,\n\n542\n00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:20.410\nwhich is really a big part of\nkeeping everything working together.\n\n543\n00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.670\nAnything else you wanna add in this\nepisode before we call it a wrap?\n\n544\n00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:26.485\n>> I'm confused already at this point, so.\n\n545\n00:30:26.485 --> 00:30:29.700\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well we hope you\nguys enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n546\n00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.130\nI know we had a good time making it.\n\n547\n00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.500\nSigning off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Broderick.\n\n548\n00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.435\n>> I'm Shaun,\ngoing to Jacksonville, Oriano.\n\n549\n00:30:35.435 --> 00:30:37.217\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n550\n00:30:37.217 --> 00:30:42.710\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.720\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.580\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.730\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.990\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.760\n>> I'm doing great, excited to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.870\nWe got another one of our CompTIA\nadvanced security practitioner\n\n9\n00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.950\nepisodes coming your way.\n\n10\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.020\nIn this one, Sean,\nwe've talked a lot about risk and\n\n11\n00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.020\nwhat risk we have with like software and\noperating systems.\n\n12\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.220\nNow, we're gonna look at\nthird party products,\n\n13\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.930\nstuff that we put on top of\nour trusted computing base.\n\n14\n00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.500\n>> Yeah, this introduces a whole\nother level of concern and issues.\n\n15\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.700\nHowever nice you want to put it,\nor however bad you want to put it.\n\n16\n00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.670\nIt brings in a whole other\nlevel of challenges.\n\n17\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.380\nI guess that sounds kind of nice,\ndoesn't it?\n\n18\n00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.550\n>> Yes.\nChallenges.\n\n19\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.590\n>> [LAUGH] And it's not that we could\navoid them, but we try to minimize them.\n\n20\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.990\n>> Yeah, that's really it, if you think\nabout security and what we're doing in\n\n21\n00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.970\nhere, if you kinda want to think\nacross the board on what we do.\n\n22\n00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.780\nMinimize, or the buzz word mitigate,\nthat's really the name of the game is.\n\n23\n00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.817\nIt is, is that we We darn well know\nwe can't get rid of it all but\n\n24\n00:01:14.817 --> 00:01:17.940\nwe know we can minimize or\nmitigate as they say.\n\n25\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.130\nSo, that's what we're trying to do.\n\n26\n00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.750\nWe know in this case that\nthat's gonna be there.\n\n27\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.390\nWe try to keep it to a low level.\n\n28\n00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.020\nIn the case of third party products\nit's just more of the same.\n\n29\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.810\nWe know there's gonna be\nthird party products.\n\n30\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.900\nThat's been the case for ages.\n\n31\n00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.940\nThere was a point in time where you\ndidn't actually see a lot of that.\n\n32\n00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.680\n>> Like the mainframe days?\n\n33\n00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.405\nI don't know.\n\n34\n00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:37.780\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's not far\n\n35\n00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.250\nremoved from that but it's.\n\n36\n00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.770\n>> You had to write all your own code for\nanything you wanted to do, I can see that.\n\n37\n00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.030\n>> Yeah, there was that and\nheck I think of the very,\n\n38\n00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.030\nvery early days of networking or\nwhen networking became popular.\n\n39\n00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.159\nI'm not talking about the old 60's\nstuff before I was even around.\n\n40\n00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Dad,\n\n41\n00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.825\ntell me once again about\nthe non-network world.\n\n42\n00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:03.813\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, as some of you may remember\n\n43\n00:02:03.813 --> 00:02:10.375\nI don't know, you recall days when\nyou had to in the late 80s early 90s?\n\n44\n00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:14.493\nThat's the time frame I'm thinking of, the\nreally early days when it started coming\n\n45\n00:02:14.493 --> 00:02:16.668\ninto the collective consciousness rather,\n\n46\n00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:20.290\nis you'd see networks that when you\nbought them, that was a big decision.\n\n47\n00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.820\nYou had to buy the whole\nnetworking system from one place.\n\n48\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.030\nThere was no intermingling of devices\nbecause people pretty much had a closed,\n\n49\n00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.070\nproprietary model.\n\n50\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.980\nSo if you made a decision,\npretty much all your software and\n\n51\n00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.730\nhardware was gonna come from a very,\nvery small ecosystem.\n\n52\n00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.890\nIt was gonna come from that company or\ntheir very few partners in there.\n\n53\n00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.832\nSo-\n>> There was\n\n54\n00:02:42.832 --> 00:02:44.560\nno box store where you could buy software.\n\n55\n00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.840\n>> Exactly.\n>> Or things like that right?\n\n56\n00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.610\n>> There are very few cases of that,\nwhen you looked\n\n57\n00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.930\nat stuff like the home computing market\nand the small business stuff, then yeah.\n\n58\n00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.580\nThere was those computer software stores.\n\n59\n00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.050\nSome of those have gone by\nthe way side years ago.\n\n60\n00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.859\nRemember Software Etc?\n\n61\n00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:06.800\nRemember that one?\n\n62\n00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.380\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n63\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.800\n[LAUGH] I remember that one.\n\n64\n00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.570\nAbsolutely.\n\n65\n00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.620\n>> Some of these old school\nones you had those shops and\n\n66\n00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.010\nthere was a good number of them out there,\nbut there wasn't tons of them.\n\n67\n00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.260\nBut when you got up to\nthe large companies,\n\n68\n00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.180\nbecause definitely the home\nuser did not have and\n\n69\n00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.498\nsmall businesses pretty much did\nnot have networking capability.\n\n70\n00:03:28.498 --> 00:03:31.740\nIt was you get to the larger\nbusinesses that did have it,\n\n71\n00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.060\nthey had to make that decision,\ntheir network cards and\n\n72\n00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.450\neverything were gonna come from a very,\nvery small community.\n\n73\n00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.163\nNow, I don't look at that as being\nthe same type of third-party stuff that we\n\n74\n00:03:40.163 --> 00:03:42.082\nhad, where you can you got the main,\nthe mothership,\n\n75\n00:03:42.082 --> 00:03:43.539\nthe main company that made the network.\n\n76\n00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:48.500\nAnd then, you had these third\nparties that made their hardware and\n\n77\n00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.899\nsoftware for it as the case was.\n\n78\n00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.408\nIt wasn't really the same,\nbecause it was so small.\n\n79\n00:03:53.408 --> 00:03:57.727\nThose people were really kind of almost\nweren't even different companies.\n\n80\n00:03:57.727 --> 00:04:01.208\nThey were really almost one company,\nso when they sold you something,\n\n81\n00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:05.190\nit was all coming from the exact same\nsource of that very small community.\n\n82\n00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.140\nNowadays, that changed a long time ago.\n\n83\n00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.300\nThat started changing in\nthe mid 90s all the way up\n\n84\n00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.200\nto today it's still changing where you\ndon't even have to think about that.\n\n85\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.540\nEven in the mid-90s when it started being\nmore open, you had to think about it a bit\n\n86\n00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.190\nmore, but nowadays, if you need a network\ncard, you need whatever, just go grab it.\n\n87\n00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.740\nWorry about what the features of that,\nwhatever it is you're getting, is.\n\n88\n00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.970\nDon't worry about if\nit's gonna be compatible.\n\n89\n00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.130\nSo that's great for the consumer and\neveryone concerned,\n\n90\n00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.270\nit makes our lives earlier, but for\n\n91\n00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.535\nwhen we're looking from a security\nstandpoint, does change things a bit.\n\n92\n00:04:41.535 --> 00:04:46.760\nWe do, from a security standpoint, you can\nlook at the good old days or bad old days,\n\n93\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.230\ndepending on what your perspective is,\nand say, it's closed ecosystem.\n\n94\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.310\nI know where everything is, lot less\nto take of and I know it works, and\n\n95\n00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.470\nI know what's going on not all this\ncrazy things going over the place.\n\n96\n00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.480\nSounds better from that standpoint,\nand you look at the new stuff,\n\n97\n00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.140\nstuff coming from all\nover different places.\n\n98\n00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.230\nIt can be a mishmash of things.\n\n99\n00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.170\nWe talked about mobile devices.\n\n100\n00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.686\nWe talked about the challenges for that,\n\n101\n00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:12.475\nit's the same type of thing with all\nthis other stuff you're introducing.\n\n102\n00:05:12.475 --> 00:05:16.711\nSo big challenge, you have to figure out\na way to, in what we're getting into here,\n\n103\n00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:20.310\nis you've gotta figure out a way to\nassess those third party products.\n\n104\n00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.684\nCheck to see what their capabilities\nare in the security area,\n\n105\n00:05:24.684 --> 00:05:30.294\nwhat type of risk brining that in, or that\nproduct itself has, as well as when you\n\n106\n00:05:30.294 --> 00:05:36.300\nmix it in in that big all your other stuff\nyou have, what it's doing to that overall.\n\n107\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.160\nYou have to figure out all those things,\nand it's not as easy as you would think.\n\n108\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.245\nAnd I would hope you're not\nthinking it's easy at this point.\n\n109\n00:05:43.245 --> 00:05:47.440\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, so I guess the first\nthing we can do is our research, right.\n\n110\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.730\nWe talked about due care and\ndue diligence,\n\n111\n00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.870\nthat probably applies here as well.\n\n112\n00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.190\nIf we're going to buy new products,\nhardware, software,\n\n113\n00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.190\nwe got to research it first.\n\n114\n00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.500\n>> Yeah, and\nthat's absolutely the case here.\n\n115\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.080\nNow fortunately today,\none of the things we didn't have in\n\n116\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.000\nthe same way back then or\nat all depending on how far back you go,\n\n117\n00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.110\nis that when you got products\nwhat did you have to wait for?\n\n118\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.600\nEither it was in a magazine someplace,\n\n119\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.900\nyou got one of those old magazines they\nhad from the stores, I remember those.\n\n120\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.810\nOr you had to wait until the latest\nissue of PC Mag or whatever came out and\n\n121\n00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.010\ndid a review on it.\n\n122\n00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.810\nAnd hopefully it answered the questions\nthat you wanted or you knew somebody\n\n123\n00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.190\nthat had worked with it and\nthey could give you their feedback on it.\n\n124\n00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.680\nOr you bought it and tested it.\n\n125\n00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.800\nStuff like that is how you would do it.\n\n126\n00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.860\nFortunately nowadays you do\nhave those things still around,\n\n127\n00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.590\nto varying degrees of course.\n\n128\n00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.960\nBut you also have the Internet and if you\nknow how to do your research correctly on\n\n129\n00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.120\nthe Internet, you're not just going around\nlooking at stuff going oh this guy gave\n\n130\n00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.470\nit one star and you look underneath, and\nhe's just on a sugar rush or something.\n\n131\n00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.760\nLike he ate too much cake at lunch.\n\n132\n00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.015\nAnd so.\n\n133\n00:06:55.015 --> 00:06:57.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I love the reviews that say,\n\n134\n00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.549\nI haven't actually got this product in\nyet, but I'm gonna give it 3 stars.\n\n135\n00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:03.384\nBecause it doesn't do this and this.\n\n136\n00:07:03.384 --> 00:07:05.321\nI'm like wait,\nyou haven't even installed it yet.\n\n137\n00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:10.300\nYeah you gotta trust your source right.\n\n138\n00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.000\n>> Let me tell you the other side of\nthat just as an aside or footnote here.\n\n139\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.800\nAs someone that's published books and\n\n140\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.400\neverything and have them show up on\nAmazon, I've had a couple of them where\n\n141\n00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.410\nsomeone's posted a review like four\nmonths before the book's released.\n\n142\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.290\nI'm still writing it, you can't\nreview it when I'm still writing it.\n\n143\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.180\nOkay, you just can't.\n\n144\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.795\nThey're like this book isn't any good and\nI'm like yeah dude you know,\n\n145\n00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:34.294\nyou really need to calm down.\n\n146\n00:07:34.294 --> 00:07:34.870\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n147\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.140\n>> Really, cuz that's an invalid review.\n\n148\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.700\nIt's funny, on the other hand it's\nlike oh, that's gonna stay up there.\n\n149\n00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.530\nSince I got a review up there if\nsomeone's like this book doesn't know\n\n150\n00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.100\nwhat it's doing.\n\n151\n00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.320\nReally, you can't do it, so\nbut that's the other side.\n\n152\n00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.520\nThat's my pain.\n\n153\n00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.273\nI'll set my burden aside.\n\n154\n00:07:51.273 --> 00:07:54.871\n>> But there's plenty of trusted sources\nout there that do hardware reviews and\n\n155\n00:07:54.871 --> 00:07:57.433\nsoftware reviews, and\nthey put it through its paces.\n\n156\n00:07:57.433 --> 00:08:01.064\nSo we don't have to worry about setting\nup like a test environment now,\n\n157\n00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:04.876\nas long as we can trust who we're\ngetting that info from That's the thing,\n\n158\n00:08:04.876 --> 00:08:07.294\nyou may not have to have\nyour own environment and\n\n159\n00:08:07.294 --> 00:08:11.130\nnot everyone is blessed with that luxury\nof having that or the time to do it.\n\n160\n00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:16.070\nYou may have the resources to do that but\nwho's got the time?\n\n161\n00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.472\nI would almost say half jokingly that\nif you're in the security field and\n\n162\n00:08:20.472 --> 00:08:23.873\nyou can say you have extra\ntime you ain't working hard.\n\n163\n00:08:23.873 --> 00:08:29.599\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I'm jokingly on that,\n\n164\n00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:34.100\nbut you guys get the idea on it.\n\n165\n00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.390\nSo you have that, but the thing is is\nthat if you can't do a test on yourself,\n\n166\n00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.570\nyeah there are a lot of good resources,\n\n167\n00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.520\nbut you've still have to have\na good head on your shoulders.\n\n168\n00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.040\nYou gotta look at those reviews\ninformation out there and have to be able\n\n169\n00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:56.670\nto dig through and wade through all\nthe BS to get the real information on it.\n\n170\n00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.540\nFortunately it's still\nfairly easy to do and\n\n171\n00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:06.600\nhow far you do it,how far you go with\nthat depends on what your risks are.If\n\n172\n00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.860\nyou're a home user or small business hey,\nit's available, what's the cost,\n\n173\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.040\ndoes it work with my stuff,\nokay plug it in, and we'll call it a day.\n\n174\n00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.560\nIf you're someone like\na government level organization or\n\n175\n00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.760\nsomething that's you know, works in one of\nthose, regulated industries, and has a lot\n\n176\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.580\nwill have a lot of heck break loose if\nthere's a breach because of something.\n\n177\n00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.060\nThen you may invest more time in it,\nall the way down to testing it.\n\n178\n00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.430\nIt really all depends.\n\n179\n00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.230\nBut that's something that you look at\nbased on what your particular position is\n\n180\n00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.890\nand what your acceptable level of risk is,\n\n181\n00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.570\nas well as,\nwhen you talk about risk don't, remember.\n\n182\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.920\nDon't just limit it to how\nlikely will something happen,\n\n183\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.070\nthat's something that I like to factor in,\nis when they do risk management,\n\n184\n00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.120\na lot of times it can be overlooked,\nand it shouldn't be.\n\n185\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.618\nIt's not just a case of you put something\nin place or something happens and\n\n186\n00:10:00.618 --> 00:10:04.117\nyou have a vulnerability introduced and\nyou have a threat against it, and\n\n187\n00:10:04.117 --> 00:10:07.177\nyou then, two come together and\nyou actually have an exposure.\n\n188\n00:10:07.177 --> 00:10:08.903\nAnd look at okay,\nwell how much did you lose?\n\n189\n00:10:08.903 --> 00:10:13.493\nAnd people look at it in terms of\ndisruption to the business, and\n\n190\n00:10:13.493 --> 00:10:17.320\nwhat that means as far as,\ndid anything get damaged?\n\n191\n00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.280\nHow long does it take to restore and\nrebuild things?\n\n192\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.980\nThey look at it in terms of that\nremember when you factor in the risk,\n\n193\n00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:30.130\nthere is also,\neven if there is zero issues on that side.\n\n194\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.350\nYou didn't have anything stolen or\nanything like that, but you had\n\n195\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.420\na breach and it's documented so nothing\ngets disturbed, but there is a breach.\n\n196\n00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.530\nYou don't report it, but\n\n197\n00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.920\nyou still have to pay a fine, that is\nsomething that goes with that risk too.\n\n198\n00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.990\nIf they said you had a breach and\nnothing got stolen, we know that.\n\n199\n00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:48.310\nBut if you had a breach hundred grand,\nthat's gonna be part of that expense.\n\n200\n00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.790\nThat also goes toward saying, is it worth\ntesting or is it not worth testing.\n\n201\n00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:55.429\n>> And then everything too,\nespecially in larger organizations,\n\n202\n00:10:55.429 --> 00:10:59.279\nthe environments start to get\na little complex and very customized.\n\n203\n00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:01.604\nCertain combinations of hardware and\n\n204\n00:11:01.604 --> 00:11:06.624\nsoftware that someplace that does these\nreviews is probably not trying to mimic.\n\n205\n00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:08.929\nSo, even though you've read the reviews,\nand\n\n206\n00:11:08.929 --> 00:11:13.130\ngone through that process you might still\nhave to test it in some cases yourself?\n\n207\n00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:17.400\n>> Yeah,\nyou've got to decide if it's something\n\n208\n00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.780\nthat you want to actually\ntest more fully yourself.\n\n209\n00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.950\n>> I mean, you could even,\nand you're right.\n\n210\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:30.200\nThese places, I'd back off from a little\nbit from the statement you made\n\n211\n00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:35.870\non there is that when they test it,\nkinda of what tests conditions.\n\n212\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.910\nI'd say there's that but\nyou know back off from it.\n\n213\n00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:43.350\nThey're really trying to in some\ncases just put it out how great this\n\n214\n00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.730\nnew product is and how great this new\nproduct is is usually centered around,\n\n215\n00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.940\nusability features and\nconvenience, stuff like that.\n\n216\n00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:54.540\nSecurity is now kind of being bumped\nup more to that discussion, but\n\n217\n00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.590\nthat's not stuff that\nthe average Joe wants to see.\n\n218\n00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.690\nIt depends on who the audience is, and\nthen, even on top of that when you look at\n\n219\n00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.100\nit, even if they did have\nthe ability to have a lab out there,\n\n220\n00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.180\ntest the stuff, and\ntest it the context of your industry.\n\n221\n00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.350\nIt's like I've said before,\nif you ask me to go,\n\n222\n00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.320\nif you ask me advice about your\nbusiness and how to secure it,\n\n223\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.090\nI can give you, I can hopefully\ngive you some good advice with it.\n\n224\n00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.750\nBut it's still gonna\nbe to a certain degree\n\n225\n00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:29.550\nnot completely usable to you because\nyou can use that stuff, yes.\n\n226\n00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.790\nBut is it gonna completely\nfit your particular scenario?\n\n227\n00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.380\nNo, because I don't know your scenario.\n\n228\n00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.360\nI have to talk to you.\n\n229\n00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.500\nYou can't just throw something\nup here in a chat room and say,\n\n230\n00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.900\nwhat can you do about this?\n\n231\n00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.730\nWell, I can give you some general\nguidance, but I don't know.\n\n232\n00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.570\nI haven't been on site,\n\n233\n00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:49.340\nI haven't talk to you enough to figure\nout what all the little details are.\n\n234\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.140\nI rely on you for\nthat cuz we haven't, we can't.\n\n235\n00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.890\nSame thing with a magazine,\n\n236\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.950\nthey can't test it in the same context and\nalso remember, by the way.\n\n237\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.310\nWhen you do this type of stuff.\n\n238\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.130\nI'm not someone that's got that\nconspiracy theory thing going on.\n\n239\n00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.390\nI know, some people really kind of\npushed that out in the surface.\n\n240\n00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:09.576\nI remember, it's not uncommon for\nthese magazines and other sources,\n\n241\n00:13:09.576 --> 00:13:13.410\nif you are getting it from\nthese types of sources.\n\n242\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.610\nIt's not common for them to have getting\nthey're getting advertising dollars from\n\n243\n00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.710\nthem too, so they don't wanna sit here and\n\n244\n00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.700\nnecessarily do anything that might\nmake the product less accessible or\n\n245\n00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.480\nmore intimidating, and\ndefinitely don't wanna say this sucks.\n\n246\n00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.680\nAnd by the way, this whole page ad\nover here, they're not gonna do that.\n\n247\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:35.250\nSo that's why I kind of like to,\nkinda expand outside that.\n\n248\n00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.700\nIt's great to look at those, but it's\nalso great to factor the other stuff in.\n\n249\n00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.730\nYou got to get this information\nwith a good eye towards it.\n\n250\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.100\n>> And most large enterprises are going\nto have some type of change management in\n\n251\n00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.630\nplace, that might even dictate that it\nhas to go through a certain procedure,\n\n252\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:55.060\ntest process, trial period what I do,\nbefore it ever comes close to production?\n\n253\n00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.570\n>> Yeah there should be.\n\n254\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.060\nYeah. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna be a little more pessimistic.\n\n255\n00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.800\n>> I say most.\n\n256\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.879\n>> Mike's the optimist here.\n\n257\n00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:04.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's like most have it, I'm like.\n\n258\n00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:13.380\nSo as new cast, we want you guys to go\nout there, go to your organization and\n\n259\n00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.930\nsay, we really need to have good\nchange management in place.\n\n260\n00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:22.860\n>> If you don't have it, you ned to\nget it, that's, but, you're right.\n\n261\n00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.890\nThat's the way it absolutely should work.\n\n262\n00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:29.450\nAnd I would say, companies that have it on\nthe ball and are really paying attention.\n\n263\n00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.940\nThey're doing it that way.\n\n264\n00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:35.470\nThat there shouldn't just be this unknown\nquantity introduced into the environment.\n\n265\n00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.440\nSo you don't have anything that's\nall of a sudden just there and\n\n266\n00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.160\nsomething odd is happening.\n\n267\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.770\nAnd think about how challenging that is,\nwhen you get down to this,\n\n268\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.980\ncuz we're kinda talking in a broad\nsense about third party stuff.\n\n269\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.340\nThink about how difficult that can be?\n\n270\n00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:59.090\nI know just to talk about\na specific vendor here\n\n271\n00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.950\nbecause this isn't a ding against them,\nso I'm making sure I say it up front,\n\n272\n00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.430\nI'm not trying to say it's,\nI'm dinging them or anything for\n\n273\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:09.020\nit, I just know because I've seen with\nthem is they're a good example of this.\n\n274\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.520\nI know there's a lot of businesses\nthat buy Dell computers.\n\n275\n00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.920\nI've got bunches and\nbunches and bunches of those.\n\n276\n00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.130\nSo you buy it from a third party or\nyou're leasing it from somebody.\n\n277\n00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.600\nThey bring these things in so\nyou go get a bunch of Dell computers\n\n278\n00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.600\nbecause you've tested one out\nof that model, you like it,\n\n279\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.410\nit does everything you need,\nit looks great.\n\n280\n00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.570\nOkay so it's awesome so you went ahead and\n\n281\n00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.979\ngot a large purchase order and\nbought tons of these things.\n\n282\n00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:44.280\nWhen you look at those models, there's\nnothing keeping Dell from later on saying\n\n283\n00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.430\nokay, well we can't get that network\ncard anymore, or that chip anymore.\n\n284\n00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.260\nAnd just swapping it out for\nsomething else.\n\n285\n00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.154\nThey'll still providing the same\nlevel of functionality to you, but\n\n286\n00:15:54.154 --> 00:15:56.798\nthat network card is not\nthe same network card.\n\n287\n00:15:56.798 --> 00:16:00.620\nDoes the same thing the other one did,\nbut it's not the same vendor, okay.\n\n288\n00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.123\nIf you're just concerned with features and\ndoes it work.\n\n289\n00:16:04.123 --> 00:16:09.440\nThen, who cares, I certainly don't if\nI am looking at it from that point.\n\n290\n00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.920\nThey can sell me oh,\nwe got it from this vendor.\n\n291\n00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.480\nBut whatever does it do the same\nthing the other one did?\n\n292\n00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.590\nCan I run windows on it?\n\n293\n00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:15.880\nYeah, ok, I'm done.\n\n294\n00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.970\nYou're bothering me, drop it off and\nI'll sign for it, go away.\n\n295\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.530\nFrom a security standpoint,\nwhat goes with new hardware,\n\n296\n00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.450\nnew drivers and\nthere could be other changes in there.\n\n297\n00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.870\nSo there's been a change, maybe it's not\nsomething that's gonna be catastrophic or\n\n298\n00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:35.100\neven a bump in the road as far as security\nis concerned, but it is a change.\n\n299\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.880\nAnd vendors can definitely do that.\n\n300\n00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.210\nSo that can be a big challenge.\n\n301\n00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:42.870\nI know about that one, specifically,\njust to give an example.\n\n302\n00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.950\nBut that one specifically,\nbecause you've done this,\n\n303\n00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.410\nremember the old stuff\nthat came before services.\n\n304\n00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:50.540\nI should know.\n\n305\n00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.270\n>> Oh, SNS we used.\n\n306\n00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.025\nOh no.\n\n307\n00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:55.399\nI thought you were talking about you know,\nremote install [INAUDIBLE].\n\n308\n00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:56.150\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n309\n00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.930\nYeah, everyone sit down,\nI know you had bad memories, you know so\n\n310\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:05.210\nkinda, remember how, going at it there\nwas only what about 8 or 10 network cards\n\n311\n00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.660\nyou could use with anything else,\nyou we're rolling the dice man.\n\n312\n00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.915\nIt may it work, and\nit probably wasn't, but\n\n313\n00:17:11.915 --> 00:17:14.630\n[LAUGH] you had to jump\nthrough a bunch of hoops.\n\n314\n00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.240\nI ran to a place that was running RIS.\n\n315\n00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.770\nAnd they actually had that thing purring.\n\n316\n00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.320\nOne of the few that actually\ngot the thing purring.\n\n317\n00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.770\nIt was working great.\n\n318\n00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.730\nAnd they got a whole batch\nof Dells in that were.\n\n319\n00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:27.710\nThose were fine.\n\n320\n00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.600\nThey were the exact same as far as\nthey were concerned as the previous\n\n321\n00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.220\nones they had.\n\n322\n00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.920\nThey just added some more.\n\n323\n00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.250\nThe network, when they put\nthe floppies and the boot off and\n\n324\n00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.890\ntry to get it to work, it wouldn't work.\n\n325\n00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.011\n>> Oh no.\n>> The would just kept\n\n326\n00:17:40.011 --> 00:17:40.572\ndigging its heels in.\n\n327\n00:17:40.572 --> 00:17:42.940\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> And they initially were going nuts,\n\n328\n00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.870\nbecause they had computers,\nwhen they were doing different things,\n\n329\n00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.580\nthat weren't playing ball.\n\n330\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.410\nWhy is there more and\nmore of these coming in?\n\n331\n00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.470\nThe guys on this side are going,\nwhy are more and\n\n332\n00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.060\nmore of these having this problem?\n\n333\n00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.210\nAnd they were scratching their heads and\ngoing nuts and\n\n334\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:03.050\neventually they start figuring,\nI go why are the new computers.\n\n335\n00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.570\nAnd they looked at a common thread,\nwhy are the new computers,\n\n336\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.830\nwhy are the old ones, you know\nplaying ball and the new ones not?\n\n337\n00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:13.510\nAnd every last new one that's come\nin is having that problem, so\n\n338\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.780\nthey tracked it down.\n\n339\n00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.340\nSomeone grabbed a couple of the computers\nand they went through with a fine-tooth\n\n340\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.610\ncomb and\nthey found out it was the network card.\n\n341\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.200\nThey changed it.\n\n342\n00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.340\nSo, minor thing.\n\n343\n00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.590\nNo one else cared.\n\n344\n00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:29.160\nAs far as the other IT guys were going\nthat were supporting these things,\n\n345\n00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:29.900\nthey worked.\n\n346\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.470\nWhen these guys were coming in,\ntrying to do refreshes and\n\n347\n00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.300\non those system was working.\n\n348\n00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:39.980\nSo, [LAUGH] a little disruptive, there.\n\n349\n00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.180\nNot everyone is going to run\ninto situations like that,\n\n350\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.180\nis it kind of one example.\n\n351\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.500\nJust be prepared.\n\n352\n00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.750\nNow, I know on here you've got down\nsecure, segmentation, and delegations.\n\n353\n00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.720\nSo maybe dividing our\nnetwork up a little bit.\n\n354\n00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.750\n>> Yeah, that's another part that\ngoes into that is when you're dealing\n\n355\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.560\nwith network management.\n\n356\n00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.610\nThis challenges third party procs\nintroducing all this stuff.\n\n357\n00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.420\nRemember you can't do it all on your own,\nwith one of the biggest challenges you\n\n358\n00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:12.550\nhave as a manager and\nI really do think its a challenge.\n\n359\n00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:16.080\nIt sounds like, for coming in,\noh, its not a big deal.\n\n360\n00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.530\nI can handle it.\n\n361\n00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.480\nBut you gotta remember that\nyou can't do it on your own.\n\n362\n00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.980\nYou're gonna have to\nsplit that task up and\n\n363\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.660\nyou have to put that ego and\nstuff like that aside.\n\n364\n00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.110\nYou want to say okay I'm gonna\ndelegate this to here and\n\n365\n00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.380\nthis to here because it just makes.\n\n366\n00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:35.480\nThings work more efficiently, but there's\nother things that go with that too.\n\n367\n00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.090\nIf you're a manager, you're a cast,\nyou're getting up there,\n\n368\n00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.570\nand you're managing other\npeople underneath, and\n\n369\n00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.850\nyou're trying to look at a big picture\nyou've gotta start evolving your thinking\n\n370\n00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:49.960\non this because you can no longer just\nsay, well this guy's doing a great job.\n\n371\n00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.380\nHe's got more than enough bandwidth to\nhandle all this so I'm gonna let that\n\n372\n00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.790\nperson have all these tasks and\nlet them continue on with it.\n\n373\n00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:02.310\nThere's an issue with that and\nI'm being kind of generic but\n\n374\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.080\nthere is an issue with that, saying hey\nthat person's got all the bandwidth.\n\n375\n00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.500\nI'm not going to retain all those tasks.\n\n376\n00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.320\nAs they have been, and\nwe're just going to keep cruising on.\n\n377\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.430\nOkay.\nWell the thing you got to think about when\n\n378\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.730\nyou look at something like that is, yeah,\nthat person's fine doing all that stuff.\n\n379\n00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.180\nWe're not saying they're not\nable to perform the job.\n\n380\n00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.200\nThey clearly are, cuz everything's just\ngoing along as it's supposed to be.\n\n381\n00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.060\nShould that person have all those jobs\nroles, remember there's a whole thing of\n\n382\n00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.200\nseparation of duties too,\nthat's bringing into the security realm.\n\n383\n00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.360\nWhen you start segmenting responsibilities\nit's no way shape or form,\n\n384\n00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.030\nmeaning someone is incapable.\n\n385\n00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.470\nI almost said uncapapble.\n\n386\n00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:42.700\nIt doesn't mean that someone's\nincapable of doing those jobs.\n\n387\n00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.420\nIt just means that from\na security standpoint,\n\n388\n00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.440\nit's not something we want to see.\n\n389\n00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.380\nThere's a conflict of interest there.\n\n390\n00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.240\nThere's not that separation of duties.\n\n391\n00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.380\nThey've got a situation where they could\nbe doing something on one side and another\n\n392\n00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.170\njob laws on what job role they have was\ngonna do something on the other side.\n\n393\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.890\nAnd they could control the whole\nprocess from the end-to-end.\n\n394\n00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.720\nThey could get away with\nsome stuff in here and\n\n395\n00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.810\nerase their footprints at the same time.\n\n396\n00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:07.560\nThat's not what we wanna have.\n\n397\n00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.450\nSo that's something else you gotta\nthink about when you're segmenting\n\n398\n00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.680\nresponsibilities out and\ndelegating responsibilities out.\n\n399\n00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.750\nThink about that aspect of it.\n\n400\n00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:21.720\nWhen you're just a regular IT person and\nI say it with all due respect, when you're\n\n401\n00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.790\na regular IT person that's not something\nyou typically have to think about.\n\n402\n00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.080\nThat's something that,\nhey can you do that?\n\n403\n00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.330\nCool.\nCan you take that, can you handle that,\n\n404\n00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.380\nare you capable?\n\n405\n00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.130\nOkay good.\nIt's your responsibility now.\n\n406\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.100\nGo for it.\n\n407\n00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.150\nCurious standpoint,\nwe're going to look at saying no, no.\n\n408\n00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.920\nThat combination of tasks you have,\nthey're incompatible according to our\n\n409\n00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.880\npolicies and procedures at a corporate\nlevel, from a common sense thing.\n\n410\n00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.070\nWe're gong to brake those things up,\nand spread them amongst other people.\n\n411\n00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.220\nWe'll give you other stuff, you know to\nreplace the ones we've taken from you, but\n\n412\n00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.260\nthose again will not conflict\nwith themselves, nor\n\n413\n00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.060\nwill they conflict with\nstuff you already have.\n\n414\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.590\nBig, big concern there.\n\n415\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:04.530\nSo that's kind of where that comes in and\nthat's something that when you're.\n\n416\n00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.020\nJust to kind of give you that\nmeasurement of knowledge.\n\n417\n00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.980\nWhen you're at something\nlike a security plus\n\n418\n00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.170\nif you go through the videos\nwe have here on that.\n\n419\n00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:19.610\nIt's noted in there that you want\nto have separation and all of that.\n\n420\n00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.820\nThat is just to put it in\nyour head at that level.\n\n421\n00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.140\nTo make you more aware of it.\n\n422\n00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.950\nYou have to be more aware of it\nwhen you enter the security area.\n\n423\n00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.450\nBut, as you get up to management stuff and\n\n424\n00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:31.030\nas then you start pushing up past the CAS\nand [INAUDIBLE] and stuff like that.\n\n425\n00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:31.720\nIt's a huge thing.\n\n426\n00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.890\nI can not just say, hand them out.\n\n427\n00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:34.990\nWho wants more.\n\n428\n00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:35.800\nWho wants seconds.\n\n429\n00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.850\nNo, I can't do that.\n\n430\n00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.920\nI have to say, okay, there's gotta\nbe combinations that are allowed and\n\n431\n00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.510\ncombinations that aren't.\n\n432\n00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.980\nAnd in integrating different products and\n\n433\n00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:47.030\nservices into our network introduces\nchallenges as well, right?\n\n434\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.660\nYeah there's that so you can separate and\n\n435\n00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.640\ndelegate responsibilities\nout all you want.\n\n436\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.370\nAnd then there's the responsibilities\nyou come in with.\n\n437\n00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.390\nWhose got what for\nwhat product and what services.\n\n438\n00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.360\nThere could be a number of\nthings happening there.\n\n439\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.870\nAnd that can introduce another level of\nchallenge because what you got is you got\n\n440\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:08.710\na situation where you've got people that\nhave certain responsibilities on them.\n\n441\n00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.970\nAnd now what do you do if that\nperson is the only person that knows\n\n442\n00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.080\na certain product.\n\n443\n00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.140\nAnd okay, so I give you that product and\nwait a minute.\n\n444\n00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.350\nYou're using that product and\n\n445\n00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:23.070\nyou do this, you're the only one that\ndoes both of those what do I do?\n\n446\n00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.970\nThat can present,\nthat can present problems.\n\n447\n00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.000\nI would say the bigger overall problem is,\nbecause when they're bringing in a third\n\n448\n00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.670\nparty, when they're bringing in any sort\nof third part stuff, is you know, first of\n\n449\n00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:36.120\nall vetting it make sure it's not gonna\ncause an undo disruptions and that's.\n\n450\n00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:36.940\nThat's always a big one.\n\n451\n00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.520\nAnd then when you're bringing that in,\n\n452\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.840\nif it's something that someone doesn't\nalready know, which is gonna happen.\n\n453\n00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.950\nYou have somebody who doesn't already\nknow that product or understand it.\n\n454\n00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:50.510\nWell then the next thing\nis getting training for it.\n\n455\n00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:51.460\nJust be smart about it.\n\n456\n00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.660\nDon't just give someone training.\n\n457\n00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.380\nLook ahead of time.\n\n458\n00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.974\nDon't just give them training because\nthey're the ones that are most skilled\n\n459\n00:23:55.974 --> 00:23:56.532\nto handle that.\n\n460\n00:23:56.532 --> 00:24:00.848\nThat's what you want but\nalso look to see when they come back,\n\n461\n00:24:00.848 --> 00:24:05.000\nare they actually in our best\ninterest to have them do that.\n\n462\n00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.452\nBecause with what they already do.\n\n463\n00:24:07.452 --> 00:24:10.408\nI see it done where business will\njust say, hey, you, you, and you,\n\n464\n00:24:10.408 --> 00:24:13.690\nyou're gonna training and just send\nthem out without giving a thought to it.\n\n465\n00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.420\nAnd that may be fine, actually at some\nlevels that's totally fine to do, but\n\n466\n00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.900\nin other areas, those people that you\nsend out to do that training, to train or\n\n467\n00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.650\ngive those responsibilities to, they're\njust, there's no way, there pretty much if\n\n468\n00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.892\nyou want to play by the rules and\ntheir the best ones to take the training.\n\n469\n00:24:29.892 --> 00:24:32.870\nThen they have to go out there,\ntake the training, work with the product,\n\n470\n00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.620\nget to know the product,\nreally understand it.\n\n471\n00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.438\nThen they're gonna be kind of\na train the trainer type thing or\n\n472\n00:24:37.438 --> 00:24:39.618\ntraining other people type thing to do it,\nso.\n\n473\n00:24:39.618 --> 00:24:40.836\n>> I know you've seen it.\n\n474\n00:24:40.836 --> 00:24:44.052\nI can't tell you how many times I've\nseen it, teaching Microsoft classes.\n\n475\n00:24:44.052 --> 00:24:47.060\nYou get into a SQL class and you go\nthrough it, you introduce everybody.\n\n476\n00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.640\nThey all get introduced.\n\n477\n00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.820\nAnd why are you here?\n\n478\n00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.835\nMy company picked me to be the SQL person.\n\n479\n00:24:51.835 --> 00:24:53.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They have no interest in databases,\n\n480\n00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:54.930\nno desire to be there.\n\n481\n00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.090\nBut, they got picked because\nthey were the smartest one or\n\n482\n00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:59.990\nthey knew how to do\nan update on a computer.\n\n483\n00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.225\nThat kind of thing.\n\n484\n00:25:01.225 --> 00:25:02.390\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n485\n00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.630\nI love those situations where they do.\n\n486\n00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.130\nI remember from years\nago where they had a.\n\n487\n00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.200\nIt was a very, very, very small\ninsurance company that was like,\n\n488\n00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.550\ninsuring like farmers and stuff like that,\nthat was their specific market.\n\n489\n00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:20.110\nSo they only had a small, a very,\nvery finite number of clients.\n\n490\n00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.680\nAnd the guy that came into\nthis class that was gonna be\n\n491\n00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.940\nmanaging a small business server.\n\n492\n00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.750\nSo now this guy got to take in all\nthe different moving parts of that.\n\n493\n00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:33.742\nIt's not like it's an incredibly complex\nthing, but it is more complex than.\n\n494\n00:25:33.742 --> 00:25:36.861\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> That have years of IT experience.\n\n495\n00:25:36.861 --> 00:25:40.610\n>> [LAUGH] I showed him\nhow to wield a bat.\n\n496\n00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.884\nBut he came in and it's like asking him,\ndoing introductions,\n\n497\n00:25:44.884 --> 00:25:47.820\nwhat's your experience with this.\n\n498\n00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.350\nIs one, I'm the guy in the office that\n\n499\n00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.300\nknows how to use the computer\nbetter than the other guys.\n\n500\n00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.850\nAnd he goes, so they just gave this to me.\n\n501\n00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:00.590\nBut okay, did you build computers,\nwhat did you do before.\n\n502\n00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.750\nYou're asking him because he\nwas good humored about it.\n\n503\n00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.760\nNo, I was the guy who had to use Office,\nhe goes really well.\n\n504\n00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.580\nAnd I just got asked questions about\neverything, but how do you do this,\n\n505\n00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.180\nand this, and this.\n\n506\n00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.170\nSo he got promoted way, way up.\n\n507\n00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.316\n[LAUGH] That's like saying hey,\nyou know the bandage is, okay good,\n\n508\n00:26:17.316 --> 00:26:20.680\nhere's a scalpel, and here's a saw,\nand go take out that guy's head and\n\n509\n00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.052\nboosts some other's brain.\n\n510\n00:26:22.052 --> 00:26:23.365\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like, what?\n\n511\n00:26:23.365 --> 00:26:25.169\nI can't do that.\n\n512\n00:26:25.169 --> 00:26:29.545\nSo it does happen.\n\n513\n00:26:29.545 --> 00:26:30.087\nIt's always funny.\n\n514\n00:26:30.087 --> 00:26:35.480\nAnd I love that when they do the one\nwhere they told me I was [INAUDIBLE].\n\n515\n00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.007\nFor me, in my head, the picture I get is\nsomeone like, you stay on that plank on\n\n516\n00:26:39.007 --> 00:26:42.492\na pirate ship when someone's poking\na sword, and you're like go, get off.\n\n517\n00:26:42.492 --> 00:26:45.149\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, well, Sean,\n\n518\n00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:45.870\nI'll tell you what.\n\n519\n00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.149\nThat was a lot of good information there.\n\n520\n00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:50.635\nWe're talking about third party products\nand the risks that they can introduce and\n\n521\n00:26:50.635 --> 00:26:52.547\njust thinking we've\ngotta be aware of them.\n\n522\n00:26:52.547 --> 00:26:57.430\nWe've gotta test products out to make sure\nwe understand what they might be bringing\n\n523\n00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.849\nin to our hopefully secure environment.\n\n524\n00:26:59.849 --> 00:27:01.531\nSo anything else you want\nto put in this episode?\n\n525\n00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:03.961\n>> Just to add a little\nbit on the end of it,\n\n526\n00:27:03.961 --> 00:27:07.131\ndon't take it as this is\nany sort of condemnation or\n\n527\n00:27:07.131 --> 00:27:12.390\nany sort of stuff towards not bringing in\nthird party stuff, that's unrealistic.\n\n528\n00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.250\nYou know,\nyou're gonna bring third party stuff in.\n\n529\n00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:20.280\nIt's just a matter of where you are,\nwhat your acceptable level of risk is.\n\n530\n00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.260\nAnd decide what level of\ntesting's gonna go with that.\n\n531\n00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:28.350\nAnd it's not completely off your shoulders\nto do your own research as part of that.\n\n532\n00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.650\nPut it through its paces\nhowever you see fit.\n\n533\n00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:34.080\nHeck, maybe you're just reading\nreviews online or asking people.\n\n534\n00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.350\nI mean, heck,\nremember in one of our previous episodes,\n\n535\n00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.720\nwe talked about different conferences and\n\n536\n00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.000\ncommunities, that, well what do\nyou think is gonna help you here?\n\n537\n00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.350\nI mean, if you can't go, if you can't, if\nyour concerned about the information that\n\n538\n00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:49.210\nmagazines and other sources\nare giving you, because they might\n\n539\n00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:52.630\nbe viewed a certain way,\nthat's what those communities are for.\n\n540\n00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:55.940\nThose communities, you're talking to\npeople that are gonna tell you the stuff,\n\n541\n00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.780\nand give you war stories and\n\n542\n00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.420\nstuff like that about how about\nexperiencing that product.\n\n543\n00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.000\nHopefully, if enough people have used it,\n\n544\n00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.790\nyou can get a really good cross\nsection of people's experiences and\n\n545\n00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.690\nlittle things that you're not\ngonna see in those magazines.\n\n546\n00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.786\nSome of that's used that in the field.\n\n547\n00:28:11.786 --> 00:28:13.108\nThat's the same thing you did.\n\n548\n00:28:13.108 --> 00:28:17.445\nThey don't really, they usually do not\nhave any sort of a horse in that race as\n\n549\n00:28:17.445 --> 00:28:19.460\nfar as moving more of that product.\n\n550\n00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.890\nSo they'll tell you, yeah,\nit sucks, I hated it, don't use it,\n\n551\n00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.050\nI'd take it out with a hammer and\nsmash it if I could, that type of stuff.\n\n552\n00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.500\nThey're gonna tell you,\nso that's a good thing.\n\n553\n00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.228\nThat's another benefit of\nhaving those third party or\n\n554\n00:28:32.228 --> 00:28:36.540\nthose communities and\nstuff like that you're part of.\n\n555\n00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.950\nThey themselves put out magazines,\nbut a lot\n\n556\n00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:43.420\nof them have like discussion groups and\nstuff like that that you can get online,\n\n557\n00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:48.010\nan email list, stuff like that you can\ndo and they prove to be very handy.\n\n558\n00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:51.730\nI, myself, have found just through my\nstuff in its field doing security,\n\n559\n00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.780\nthose have really helped out in a number\nof cases where I can get someone that\n\n560\n00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:58.750\nsays that product, no matter what\nthey say, is a pile of crap.\n\n561\n00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:59.575\nAnd let me tell you why.\n\n562\n00:28:59.575 --> 00:29:05.270\nAnd they'll give you more technical\nstuff and eye watering stuff then.\n\n563\n00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.105\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You see it in any other place like,\n\n564\n00:29:08.105 --> 00:29:10.785\nwow this guy really knows his stuff and\nhas really gone through it and\n\n565\n00:29:10.785 --> 00:29:11.965\nhe's made his case.\n\n566\n00:29:11.965 --> 00:29:14.090\nI won't get that now.\n\n567\n00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.200\n>> [LAUGH] Good, unbiased opinions,\nthey are valuable.\n\n568\n00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.510\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n569\n00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.920\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n570\n00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.920\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n571\n00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.146\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n572\n00:29:24.146 --> 00:29:29.850\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:14.840\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.440\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.490\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.975\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:19.770\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.450\nI'm having a great time here at ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.610\nAnd continuing,\n\n10\n00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.100\nwe're working on our CompTIA Advanced\nSecurity Practitioner episodes.\n\n11\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.950\nIn this one, we're gonna be talking\nabout communication security control.\n\n12\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.990\nSo things that we can put in place to\n\n13\n00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.830\neffectively secure different\ntypes of communication.\n\n14\n00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.760\n>> Yep, that's exactly what we're\ngetting into, is this, when you talk\n\n15\n00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.220\nabout communication and we're throwing\nanother part of this in here,\n\n16\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.920\nit's communication and don't forget,\nit's the collaboration part of it.\n\n17\n00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.300\nSo not just talking to one another,\nit's bringing groups together now.\n\n18\n00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.210\nSince that's an integral part\nof any business, and we're\n\n19\n00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.260\ntalking all the communication types here,\nwe're not just talking one specific one.\n\n20\n00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.410\nWe're talking of course the email,\njust regular text messaging or\n\n21\n00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.280\ntalking, messenger based stuff,\nthrough the other messaging programs.\n\n22\n00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.790\nWe're talking voice and\nall that type of stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.408\nThere's a lot of things that go,\n\n24\n00:01:18.408 --> 00:01:22.590\nthat fall under this banner\nthat you wouldn't know about.\n\n25\n00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.460\nSo, it's one of those things of\ncommunication and now the collaboration\n\n26\n00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.150\ntools that have built upon that,\nextended that model even further.\n\n27\n00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.060\nBusinesses just don't function, you\ncan't have a few thousand employees and\n\n28\n00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.000\nhave them never talk to one another,\nit don't work.\n\n29\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.050\n>> There are a few companies\nthere are islands amongst,\n\n30\n00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.663\nthey have to be communicating\nwith other companies as well so.\n\n31\n00:01:42.663 --> 00:01:44.287\n>> Yep, exactly.\n\n32\n00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:45.770\nThat's the whole thing.\n\n33\n00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.598\nThere's gonna be some\nform of communication.\n\n34\n00:01:48.598 --> 00:01:53.610\nSo as a security person, well we\nknow that communication's happening.\n\n35\n00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.461\nWe know by it's very nature that\ncommunication within an organization's\n\n36\n00:01:57.461 --> 00:02:01.496\ngonna include some level of sensitive\ninformation, so, we've gotta figure\n\n37\n00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:05.160\nout a way with our role coming in,\non how we're going to protect that and\n\n38\n00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.623\nkeep that sensitive information that's\nbeing talked about from being intercepted,\n\n39\n00:02:09.623 --> 00:02:12.715\nor monkeyed with, or\nbeing lost or anything like that.\n\n40\n00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:14.830\nWe need to figure out solutions for that.\n\n41\n00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.503\nThis is one of those areas where the whole\nCIA triad that the always are talking\n\n42\n00:02:18.503 --> 00:02:22.460\nabout and you should never forget, it's\none of those things that definitely comes\n\n43\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.079\ninto play in full swing here,\nbecause keeping information confidential,\n\n44\n00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.678\nmaking sure it's not changed\nin any way shape or form,\n\n45\n00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:32.640\nmaking sure it just plain works, [LAUGH]\nand you can talk to the other side.\n\n46\n00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.520\nThat's all part of this.\n\n47\n00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.740\nSo we can't forget that.\n\n48\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.090\n>> And for those of you who forgot,\nhopefully you haven't, but\n\n49\n00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.080\nour CIA triad confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n50\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.890\nAll right, so\nunified communication security.\n\n51\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.740\nIt kind of gives you the idea\nthat it's an umbrella that can\n\n52\n00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.540\ncover a lot of different bases.\n\n53\n00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.423\n>> Yeah, that's the new buzz word,\nas they like to say,\n\n54\n00:02:57.423 --> 00:03:02.530\nit was unified communications for a long,\nlong time, and they still use that.\n\n55\n00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.200\nIt's a very popular way to go and\n\n56\n00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.800\nthere's all these ways you can\naccomplish unified security.\n\n57\n00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.420\nYou can use different types of\nthird-party products to do that.\n\n58\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.630\nYou can find all combinations of\nways to unify at least, I'll say,\n\n59\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.490\nthere's unified and then,\nthere's partially unified security,\n\n60\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.242\nwhere they've got some stuff,\nbut not all over there.\n\n61\n00:03:27.242 --> 00:03:28.550\n>> [LAUGH] Quasi-unified?\n\n62\n00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.262\n>> Yeah, they're like,\nyeah, we're getting there.\n\n63\n00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:32.390\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.943\n>> When you talk about unified\n\n65\n00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:41.030\ncommunications, yeah,\nthere's many ways to approach it.\n\n66\n00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.310\nBut the goal is, with unified securities,\n\n67\n00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.400\nto bring everything underneath\nthat one umbrella or banner.\n\n68\n00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.460\nSo what we can have is instead of having\nour voice communications sitting over\n\n69\n00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.271\nhere, email communications\nsitting over here, and\n\n70\n00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:58.956\nwhat other communications sitting in other\nplaces, like now with your mobile devices,\n\n71\n00:03:58.956 --> 00:04:02.452\nthat type of stuff, we can now bring\nthat all under one banner, and\n\n72\n00:04:02.452 --> 00:04:05.170\nthat would even include\nstuff like faxes in there.\n\n73\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.300\nWe still know that faxes are being used.\n\n74\n00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.090\nWe're not getting away with it\nany time soon, it seems like.\n\n75\n00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.030\nSo that's all being brought in that\nsame banner, so it manages all of that,\n\n76\n00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.020\nall the voicemails and all that stuff that\ngoes with communicating, so instead of\n\n77\n00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.190\nhaving all these different systems-\n>> Streaming video and audio.\n\n78\n00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.290\n>> Oh yeah, absolutely.\n\n79\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.820\n>> VoIP, and everything.\n\n80\n00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.584\n>> I knew I was forgetting something.\n\n81\n00:04:25.584 --> 00:04:29.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we're bringing all those things\n\n82\n00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.830\nunder that one banner,\nthe idea that once you start unifying and\n\n83\n00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.310\nhave systems that can manage all of that,\nyou've got hopefully less overhead and\n\n84\n00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.620\nless mess there,\nbecause you've got that bigger system,\n\n85\n00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.110\nor you've got a system that's bigger\nthan just one of them would be.\n\n86\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.060\nBut when you combine them all, it's big,\nbut it's not as big as all of them would\n\n87\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.340\nbe if you just had them sitting out there,\nbecause you don't have, hopefully,\n\n88\n00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.220\ndo not have a separate group for\nmanaging voice anymore.\n\n89\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.440\nOne for managing voiceover IP, if you've\ngot it, and the traditional phone systems.\n\n90\n00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.690\nYou don't have all of those things.\n\n91\n00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.530\nYou're all bringing them under\nthat one thing to make it easier.\n\n92\n00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.450\nSo, there's no longer duplication\nthere and we're striving for that.\n\n93\n00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.530\nIf you think about it, there used to be\na big need for that really, when you, or\n\n94\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.160\neven before unified communications,\nto be a big, I should say need.\n\n95\n00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.130\nThere used to be a big,\nthe big thing was to have the IT stuff,\n\n96\n00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.730\nand then, at least the way, my perspective\nis, maybe not everyone had the same thing,\n\n97\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.280\nmy perspective was you had the IT guys\ndoing their thing with the email and\n\n98\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.740\nall that, and then you had on the other\nside of the building on some cases\n\n99\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.640\nwere the people that\nhandled the phone systems.\n\n100\n00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.020\nThey were two separate groups and\nthere could be some duplication there, but\n\n101\n00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.520\nthey were the two separate groups.\n\n102\n00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.610\nBut then as phones got\nto be more advanced and\n\n103\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.860\nthey started introducing\nmore of the current and\n\n104\n00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.060\nmodern technology into it, and then\nstarting to switch over to voice over IP.\n\n105\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.490\nWith voice over IP you're just\npassing traffic over the network,\n\n106\n00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.230\nthat's all it is.\n\n107\n00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.870\nIf it happens to be voice, so what?\n\n108\n00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.650\nIt's just going over the network.\n\n109\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.270\nSo now those people are doing voice, and\n\n110\n00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.370\nthe people that are doing IT they're\nreally doing the same thing, so\n\n111\n00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.060\nwhy have two separate teams there and two\nseparate infrastructures to go with it?\n\n112\n00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.020\nI can role them more close towards being\none, if not one complete thing, and\n\n113\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.330\nget rid of some of that replication and\nmake things easier.\n\n114\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.250\nNow from an IT standpoint\nthat's one thing,\n\n115\n00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.350\nfrom a security standpoint\nthat's even better.\n\n116\n00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.190\nWe're trying to minimize\nthe amount of moving parts that we\n\n117\n00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.540\nhave to keep our eye on.\n\n118\n00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.460\nAnd so this helps us out tremendously\nbecause it's less things that we have to\n\n119\n00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.950\nkeep an eye on.\n\n120\n00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.990\nWe can make more of\na comprehensive security solution.\n\n121\n00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.270\nIt's just something that we like to see,\nso there you go.\n\n122\n00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.720\n>> I know in some other classes I've done,\n\n123\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.010\nwe've talked about these\nunified solutions.\n\n124\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.070\nAnd the big advantage was\nsimplified administration,\n\n125\n00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.850\nbecause I've got one portal, maybe,\nthat I go to, that I manage.\n\n126\n00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:08.150\nNow my video conferencing,\nmy web conferencing, my VoIP, my fax or\n\n127\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.580\nwhatever it's all through this one.\n\n128\n00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.030\nSo it's less to learn for\nadministrators and\n\n129\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.410\nthings like that, but then on the con\nside of things, if that system fails,\n\n130\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.630\nI'm not losing just my VoIP or\njust my fax system.\n\n131\n00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.430\nNow I'm losing everything as well.\n\n132\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.620\nIs that something we\nstill gotta worry about?\n\n133\n00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.740\n>> Yeah, there's probably the people\nwatching this, I mean heck,\n\n134\n00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.580\nyou could probably pose that question\nin one of your guys' discussion groups,\n\n135\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.470\njust stand back and watch it happen.\n\n136\n00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.930\nYeah it's definitely a concern,\nI mean ask anybody.\n\n137\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.002\nI would say put it this way cuz you\ndon't have to just take my spin on it,\n\n138\n00:07:46.002 --> 00:07:48.917\nask anybody that's\nimplemented VoIP services.\n\n139\n00:07:48.917 --> 00:07:52.993\nAsk them the fun and games they had\nwith that, if it was planned correctly,\n\n140\n00:07:52.993 --> 00:07:56.920\nbecause it sounds great on paper,\nand it is if it's done right.\n\n141\n00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.593\nThere's no problem with it.\n\n142\n00:07:59.593 --> 00:08:01.500\nYou should not be scared\nof that technology at all.\n\n143\n00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.730\nIt's pretty awesome, so when you set\nit up right, get all that stuff done,\n\n144\n00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.180\ndo your planning, great.\n\n145\n00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.740\nOne of the best VoIP systems I ever\nsaw was in a hotel in a place I was\n\n146\n00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.295\nstaying overseas where when you checked\ninto your room and you go up to your room,\n\n147\n00:08:17.295 --> 00:08:21.400\nthe little LCD screen on there had your\nname and everything set up on there.\n\n148\n00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.290\nThey knew exactly how long you were\ngonna be in there, all that ready to go.\n\n149\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.140\nThe quality of voice on\nthose things was amazing,\n\n150\n00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.140\nit was crystal clear, nice and crisp.\n\n151\n00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.450\nResponsiveness was great.\n\n152\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.130\nNothing, if you didn't know that was voice\nover IP coming from our perspective we can\n\n153\n00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.480\ntell, but from someone else's perspective\nit's a phone, that's all it is.\n\n154\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.050\nIt may have a little screen on it like\noh look it's got my name on it, but\n\n155\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:53.160\nfrom anyone else's perspective, it's just\na phone that's the way it should be.\n\n156\n00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.420\nBut it's not always that way because if\nyou go back to what we were just saying,\n\n157\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.530\nis that it's just network communications,\nand\n\n158\n00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.650\nyou're just pushing\npackets over the network.\n\n159\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.640\nIf you ignore the fact that it happens to\nbe voice you're passing over the network,\n\n160\n00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.510\nthen ask a question.\n\n161\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.750\nIs disruptions and\noutages all still a problem?\n\n162\n00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.479\nAre they still a problem\nwith the networks?\n\n163\n00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.600\nThere you go.\n\n164\n00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.130\n>> And if you've got a vulnerability in\nyou're a unified communications solution,\n\n165\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.070\nthen that vulnerability now could\naffect your instant messaging,\n\n166\n00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.450\nyour video conferencing, and everything.\n\n167\n00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.570\nWhere as if they're all separate products,\n\n168\n00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.970\na vulnerability only introduces risks\nto maybe one of those technologies, so.\n\n169\n00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.530\nBut I think they're getting better.\n\n170\n00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.020\n>> Well, that's the thing,\nthe are getting better, absolutely,\n\n171\n00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.320\nbecause what's happening is there's been\nsome people cutting their teeth on it.\n\n172\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.681\nSome people have been\non the bleeding edge.\n\n173\n00:09:44.681 --> 00:09:46.701\nIt's like oh,\nlet's get that voice over IP.\n\n174\n00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:49.835\nYou've seen some creative solutions\nwhere they have separate network for\n\n175\n00:09:49.835 --> 00:09:53.170\nvoice over IP, still a network but\nit was a separate one just for that.\n\n176\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:58.040\nYou've seen companies do different things\nof quality of service to prioritize\n\n177\n00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.040\ntraffic in ways that it\nmade it more efficient.\n\n178\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.950\nBut then you have the people\nthat have been so\n\n179\n00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.260\nfar in the bleeding edge\nthat they put this stuff in.\n\n180\n00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.710\nAnd they thought it was\nkind of like Skype.\n\n181\n00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.530\nAnd they're like, oh,\nI'll use Skype and Skype's good.\n\n182\n00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.220\nIt's like, have you really used Skype?\n\n183\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.190\nSkype's a good product but\nit's a consumer product and\n\n184\n00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.279\nthat's where it's targeted for.\n\n185\n00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.260\nIt still has issues with buffering and\nif you're doing video-over,\n\n186\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.900\nthe video's not always\nat the right quality.\n\n187\n00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.860\nBut overall, it's a good experience.\n\n188\n00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.220\nBut that's not something that's\nacceptable for business.\n\n189\n00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.200\nWe can't have, it's good enough.\n\n190\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.330\nIt's gotta be great.\n\n191\n00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330\nSo, things like quality\nof service sounds good.\n\n192\n00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.250\nPrioritize and\n\n193\n00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:37.630\nreserve some of that traffic aside so\nyou can adjust to dynamic stuff.\n\n194\n00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.260\nIt only gets you so far.\n\n195\n00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.790\nOne place I heard that\nset up voice over IP,\n\n196\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.880\nthey did it when they\ndid quality of service.\n\n197\n00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.010\nThey said, hey it was good it helped us up\nto the point but our network never really\n\n198\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.650\nhad all the stuff it need to do than other\nthings that weren't part of that voice.\n\n199\n00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.730\nAnd then if things got bad enough, the\nquality of service would actually start,\n\n200\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.704\nfor the voice over IP system, would\nonly have the manager's phones working.\n\n201\n00:11:00.704 --> 00:11:03.295\nSo if there wasn't enough bandwidth to\ngo around for all the voice systems,\n\n202\n00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:05.533\nit would actually start cutting\noff some of the lower employees.\n\n203\n00:11:05.533 --> 00:11:07.693\nTheir phones wouldn't work so\nthey're getting on cell phones.\n\n204\n00:11:07.693 --> 00:11:11.291\n>> Who wrote those rules?\n\n205\n00:11:11.291 --> 00:11:12.705\n>> Yeah, someone did that.\n\n206\n00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:13.905\nYou gotta wonder right.\n\n207\n00:11:13.905 --> 00:11:15.400\n>> If it gets too bad,\nmake sure my phone still works.\n\n208\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.882\nOf course I might be one of\nthe employees that said hey,\n\n209\n00:11:17.882 --> 00:11:22.172\nI'm okay with my phone not working for\nan hour here while the bandwidth is bad.\n\n210\n00:11:22.172 --> 00:11:24.112\nSo let's talk about\nvoice over IP security.\n\n211\n00:11:24.112 --> 00:11:28.382\nNow, as you said, it's just, we're taking\nour voice packets, our voice information,\n\n212\n00:11:28.382 --> 00:11:31.551\nand putting it in packets and\nsending it along using In TCP/IP.\n\n213\n00:11:31.551 --> 00:11:36.354\nSo we can use some of our normal network\nsecurity methods that we use, but\n\n214\n00:11:36.354 --> 00:11:41.577\nthere's also stuff specific of voice\nover IP that we have to worry about, or?\n\n215\n00:11:41.577 --> 00:11:43.541\n>> Yeah, there are some things, and\n\n216\n00:11:43.541 --> 00:11:47.754\na good number of those things would be\nspecific to a vendor, first of all.\n\n217\n00:11:47.754 --> 00:11:52.431\nSo those we can't worry about too much,\nbut the big thing that's been with\n\n218\n00:11:52.431 --> 00:11:57.910\nvoice over IP security is the encryption\nand protection on that voice traffic.\n\n219\n00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.752\nYou cannot have a system that\ndoesn't have very good or\n\n220\n00:12:02.752 --> 00:12:08.312\nabove very good encryption\nimplemented on it.\n\n221\n00:12:08.312 --> 00:12:12.080\nI'm talking as good as you\ncan get from end to end,\n\n222\n00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.980\nfrom point to point because if\nyou mess that up, remember,\n\n223\n00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.390\nit's traffic on a network.\n\n224\n00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.680\nDo we not have something that can\ncapture traffic on a network?\n\n225\n00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.790\nIf you say no, yeah,\nyou haven't been paying attention.\n\n226\n00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.420\nBecause we already have those things.\n\n227\n00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.204\nThere's already network sniffers out\nthere that will specifically look for\n\n228\n00:12:34.204 --> 00:12:37.230\nvoice over IP traffic so\nThat's a huge concern.\n\n229\n00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:42.800\nThe other thing is that we've had,\nand Skype suffered from this for\n\n230\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.730\na while as did other ones, is when it\nwas doing that initial handshake and\n\n231\n00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:53.280\nit was going from your mouth through\nthe device and out to the network.\n\n232\n00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.342\nThere was a point in there where you\ncould actually get in as an attacker and\n\n233\n00:12:58.342 --> 00:13:00.530\nintercept it and\ndo basically a man in the middle.\n\n234\n00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:04.100\nThey closed that a long time ago but\nthere was a little problem with that and\n\n235\n00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:09.040\nsome other systems sub from that so\nsecurity in protecting that\n\n236\n00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.850\nvoice traffic is absolutely,\npositively essential.\n\n237\n00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.440\nIf you don't get that right,\n\n238\n00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.270\nit's just as simple as grabbing\npackets on the network at that point.\n\n239\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.900\nSo that would be the number one thing.\n\n240\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.870\nAs far as the other security stuff goes,\n\n241\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.770\na lot of those things are vendor specific,\nas I was saying, but\n\n242\n00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:31.840\nthen you also gotta look at that last part\nof our triad, the a, the availability.\n\n243\n00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.340\nThe availability stuff, fortunately,\nwhen you're talking availability for\n\n244\n00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.830\na voice over IP system,\nsince it is, again,\n\n245\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.442\ngoing back to that whole idea\nit's traffic on a network.\n\n246\n00:13:41.442 --> 00:13:46.140\nSo if it's traffic on a network and\nif that network gets severed or\n\n247\n00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.750\ngets interrupted, or whatever, then what's\ngonna happen to your voice traffic?\n\n248\n00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.030\nYou're gonna lose it,\njust like any other network traffic.\n\n249\n00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:54.520\nSo if I pose the question to you and\n\n250\n00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.840\nsaid, what would you do with your\nnetwork traffic as it is now?\n\n251\n00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.320\nIgnore the fact that it's voice over IP,\nI could care less,\n\n252\n00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.320\nyou haven't even heard\nit by that name before.\n\n253\n00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.780\nIf I asked you what you would do\nif I ask you to say, to keep your\n\n254\n00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:13.360\nnetwork available as much as possible from\nthe links available as much as possible.\n\n255\n00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.730\nAsk your self what you would do, those\nthings are pretty much gonna translate\n\n256\n00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:21.570\nover to voice over IP cuz it's the same\ntype of traffic, so if you can do that and\n\n257\n00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.010\nthink about those things\nyou're in good shape.\n\n258\n00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.880\nI'm not saying that easy and\nnot saying, oh, well,\n\n259\n00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.530\njust add some more stuff\non there that works.\n\n260\n00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.920\nIt's just traffic.\n\n261\n00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.860\nIt is just traffic and I'm kind of making\nit generic, but there's other things you\n\n262\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.310\ncan do but you can see that some of\nthe things just carry right on over.\n\n263\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.975\nIt was traditional phone system\nit wouldn't be that easy.\n\n264\n00:14:38.975 --> 00:14:42.280\nSo there's that to think about.\n\n265\n00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.600\nAlso remember, by the way,\nthat with voice over IP,\n\n266\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.960\nI think that you just kind of have\nto mention it is voice over IP.\n\n267\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.780\nI know Skype makes a big deal about\nthis when you sign up for it.\n\n268\n00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.320\nSkype tells you, don't use us for\n911 stuff because they cannot\n\n269\n00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.970\ntrace your location on this\nthe way they need to for 911.\n\n270\n00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:05.350\nSo remember if you have anything that\nties into traditional voice system that\n\n271\n00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:10.780\nyou need than think if you have a way to\nprovide the same service in voice over IP.\n\n272\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.010\nAnd if you do then hey fine,\nyou're good to move.\n\n273\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.670\nBut think about it,\nthink about those types of situations.\n\n274\n00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:23.370\nSo what kind of implementations do I\nhave to worry about with voice over IP?\n\n275\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.450\nI guess like you said\npretty much the same again?\n\n276\n00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:32.320\n>> I would say when you're\nimplementing voice over IP probably\n\n277\n00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.320\nthe biggest thing people have with it is\nthey're just not doing their planning.\n\n278\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.310\nThey're taking the whole\nthing that I'm saying\n\n279\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.810\noh it's more traffic to put on a network.\n\n280\n00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.651\nI'm not some genius that came up with it,\njust look at the traffic on a network.\n\n281\n00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:48.445\nThat's been said in several circles.\n\n282\n00:15:48.445 --> 00:15:50.173\nIt's traffic on a network.\n\n283\n00:15:50.173 --> 00:15:51.618\nYes it is.\n\n284\n00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:55.073\nBut you never hear heard sit and\ntell you that you,\n\n285\n00:15:55.073 --> 00:15:58.620\nto heck with all the other\nthings that it's doing.\n\n286\n00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.240\nIt's just traffic.\n\n287\n00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.570\nI'm telling you that yes, traffic on\na network but I'm not telling you.\n\n288\n00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.790\nEntirely, solely treated like that.\n\n289\n00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.300\nI'm telling you, there's some problems.\n\n290\n00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.550\nNotice I said about if you start running\nout of bandwidth or low on it, it's gonna\n\n291\n00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:17.490\nstart causing problems with who can talk\nand buffering and cutting off of phones.\n\n292\n00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.830\nSome voice over IP systems, you won't\neven get to the to the buffering stage.\n\n293\n00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.120\nJust all of a sudden, some of you\naren't talking anymore, bye-bye.\n\n294\n00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.430\nIt'll do that.\n\n295\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.950\nSo yeah, it's traffic on a network, but\nyou have to be respectful of that and\n\n296\n00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.540\nthink about it's not like your\nother Stuff on your network where\n\n297\n00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.310\nit's designed to work on\na less than ideal situation.\n\n298\n00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.910\nIf you're gonna be talking to\nsomeone in real time over that,\n\n299\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.280\nyou really gotta have a good\namount of bandwidth to do that.\n\n300\n00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.250\nSo, the implementation problems with CS\npeople not planning for that accordingly.\n\n301\n00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.550\nOr they say oh, we'll just do it.\n\n302\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:56.330\nQOS on it, the quality of service,\nset aside a number of bandwidth.\n\n303\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.620\nAnd this is one of the places\nwhere I can do this and\n\n304\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.880\nget away with doing something like this if\nI said hey hands up, whose got more than\n\n305\n00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.660\nenough bandwidth on their network that\nthey have than they know what to do with.\n\n306\n00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.840\nRaise your hand,\nI can't see them raise their hand but\n\n307\n00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.300\nif I could they wouldn't\nraise them anyway.\n\n308\n00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.825\nSo, because no one ever says that.\n\n309\n00:17:11.825 --> 00:17:12.530\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> No one\n\n310\n00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.580\never says I got more bandwidth\nthan I know what to do with.\n\n311\n00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.585\nNo you don't.\n\n312\n00:17:16.585 --> 00:17:17.759\n[LAUGH] You just don't.\n\n313\n00:17:17.759 --> 00:17:19.415\nYou're lying.\n\n314\n00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:22.955\nNo one has that situation,\nso when someone comes in and\n\n315\n00:17:22.955 --> 00:17:24.635\nsays we're gonna implement voice over IP.\n\n316\n00:17:24.635 --> 00:17:26.905\nA salt to management saying well\nwe're gonna put voice over IP.\n\n317\n00:17:26.905 --> 00:17:28.835\nAnd they're like what about\nthese problems we're hearing.\n\n318\n00:17:28.835 --> 00:17:32.735\nOur tech guys have been\ntelling us that type of stuff.\n\n319\n00:17:32.735 --> 00:17:37.155\nThat if we implement this,\nit's going to cause all these issues.\n\n320\n00:17:37.155 --> 00:17:39.475\nWe're like hey,\nwe've taken care a long time ago.\n\n321\n00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:42.155\nDo quality of service, and\ndo a set aside, and no problem.\n\n322\n00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.710\nWell, yeah.\n\n323\n00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.940\nBut if you already limited\non what you have and\n\n324\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.930\nyou're saying I'm going to take\npart of that limited stuff away.\n\n325\n00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.830\nGuess what your other\nstuff's going to suffer,\n\n326\n00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.140\nas well as you're eventually\ngonna have problems.\n\n327\n00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.010\nYou're basically balancing\non the knife's edge there.\n\n328\n00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.550\nBy taking away more of\nwhat you don't have.\n\n329\n00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:06.470\nI's like, not that I've had this happen,\nwhen you bounce a check a something,\n\n330\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.295\nbank charges you extra money,\nwhat you don't have.\n\n331\n00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:10.230\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> It's the same kind of thing.\n\n332\n00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.710\nEverybody will go how I'm\ngonna solve this problem?\n\n333\n00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.270\nSo you have to.\n\n334\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:18.040\nYes it is network traffic but\nwhen you do your implementation you've\n\n335\n00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.930\ngot to think ahead of yeah you're\nplugging extra devices on their.\n\n336\n00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.240\nAnd, you're gonna have to\nsee is your network capable\n\n337\n00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.550\nof supporting the extra stuff.\n\n338\n00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.650\nSo, you can put stress tests in place,\n\n339\n00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.460\nstuff like that, and\nsee if you got enough.\n\n340\n00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.780\nAnd see about adding on more as necessary.\n\n341\n00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.730\nSo, that's just kind of the biggest thing.\n\n342\n00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.080\nYou know, security stuff,\nas long as you're above board and\n\n343\n00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.570\naware of the stuff that we talked about,\nyou're probably gonna be okay,\n\n344\n00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.830\nif you've got an awareness of it but the\nnumber one thing I see with implementation\n\n345\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.740\nis basically people shooting themselves\nin the foot with that availability\n\n346\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.710\nthing because they haven't really\nlooked at what the requirements are.\n\n347\n00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.960\nAnybody will tell you, and it seems like\nyou've got people here in the chatroom\n\n348\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.510\nthat have set up voice over IP\nsystems that have worked for them.\n\n349\n00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.200\nAsk anybody.\n\n350\n00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.140\nI don't know if you've had the pleasure or\nmisfortune of talking to\n\n351\n00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:14.020\na voice over IP system,\nalmost to a T I hear something\n\n352\n00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:19.240\nalong the lines of voice over\nIP systems are a bandwidth hog.\n\n353\n00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:24.180\nTheres always something that's right along\nthat line of being as a bandwidth hog.\n\n354\n00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:24.750\nOkay.\nYeah.\n\n355\n00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:30.600\nSo, don't implement something that's\na bandwidth hog in an environment that you\n\n356\n00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.770\ndon't have.\n\n357\n00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:32.530\nDon't have a,\n\n358\n00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.625\nwhat is it, they don't have a champagne\nbudget on a bottled water budget.\n\n359\n00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:40.068\n>> [LAUGH] Champagne\ntaste on a beer salary.\n\n360\n00:19:40.068 --> 00:19:40.667\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n361\n00:19:40.667 --> 00:19:42.390\n>> I do that one all the time.\n\n362\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.680\nAnd then we've got remote access and,\nof course,\n\n363\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.230\nthat brings a whole nother\nset of concerns in.\n\n364\n00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.550\nWhen we open up our network for that,\n\n365\n00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.320\nbecause we've got data that\ncould be traveling back and\n\n366\n00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.580\nforth between that user,\nwherever they are.\n\n367\n00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.280\nThey're remote from our location,\nwhether they're in a branch office,\n\n368\n00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.130\nor a hotel, or at home.\n\n369\n00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.650\n>> Yeah, that's the thing,\nis that that remote access,\n\n370\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:05.190\nmuch like as we talked about\nin a previous episode,\n\n371\n00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:10.840\nwe talked about mobile devices,\nwhich are definitely part of this.\n\n372\n00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.600\nWhen we talk about mobile devices, remote\naccess, you've got people working from\n\n373\n00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.820\nsomeplace else other than your fixed\nlocation or your main location.\n\n374\n00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.240\nAnd so, yeah, you're firing stuff back and\n\n375\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.410\nforth that could be intercepted\nbetween those points.\n\n376\n00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:30.165\nSo you have to really plan ahead and\nmake sure, that doesn't happen.\n\n377\n00:20:30.165 --> 00:20:34.375\nFortunately, a lot of those things have\nbeen taken care of a long time ago.\n\n378\n00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:38.205\nIt's only in places where they're not\ntaken care of where you're talking\n\n379\n00:20:38.205 --> 00:20:39.615\nabout the old technologies.\n\n380\n00:20:39.615 --> 00:20:44.236\nFor someone using, the one that's\ncoming to mind right now is.\n\n381\n00:20:44.236 --> 00:20:50.020\nI can't remember the last people that used\nthat but I know there's someone out there.\n\n382\n00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:55.670\nI think, gosh way back in 2000 they\npretty much started doing away with that.\n\n383\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.825\nYou could slip in but\nyou couldn't slip out.\n\n384\n00:20:57.825 --> 00:20:59.220\n[LAUGH].\n>> There you go.\n\n385\n00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.430\n>> It didn't support.\n\n386\n00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.900\n>> Setting up a slow connection but\nyou can slip into something else.\n\n387\n00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.600\nAnd then configuring.\n\n388\n00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.280\nThere's plenty of good protocols to\nchoose when it comes to remote access and\n\n389\n00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.640\nthat but they all have to be configured.\n\n390\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.220\nYou have to use your encryption methods,\nyour authentication methods, and\n\n391\n00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.730\nthings like that?\n\n392\n00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.420\nYeah, and\nthat's the thing is remote access.\n\n393\n00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.040\nI would never tell you that it's something\nthat is horrible and you should never use.\n\n394\n00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.480\nIt's a something that's a life\nline here for a lot of people.\n\n395\n00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.480\nSome people would not be able to do\nthe work that they do the same way\n\n396\n00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.720\nwithout remote access.\n\n397\n00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.400\nWe all know it so it's not something that\nyou just can say we're gonna axe that and\n\n398\n00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.230\nnever use it.\n\n399\n00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:43.000\nNo we actually have to take that\ninto account, it needs to be there.\n\n400\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.260\nI can't help but thinking how\nwhen I think about remote access.\n\n401\n00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.790\nEver since someone told me about\nthe scenario about 6, 7 years ago.\n\n402\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.600\nI can't get it out of my head\nwhenever I talk about it.\n\n403\n00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.250\nIf remote access was taken away or\neven, mobile access taken away and\n\n404\n00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.530\nthings in that area.\n\n405\n00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:04.190\nHow different things would be for\nthese people cuz I was\n\n406\n00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:09.450\ntalking to someone or working with them\nin another state here, on the East Coast.\n\n407\n00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.790\nThat they were,\nit was the VA in that state and\n\n408\n00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:19.620\nwhat they were doing is that\nthey had nurses that would go\n\n409\n00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:25.780\nout to people's homes to check\non vets that needed that.\n\n410\n00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.640\nThey would go and check on them so\nyou have people that okay,\n\n411\n00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.320\nyou have patients that can't move, can't\nget out of the house, it's very tough for\n\n412\n00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.130\nthem, they're elderly,\nthose type of things are tough.\n\n413\n00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:40.620\nAnd you had a state where a lot of those\npeople were spread out over a pretty broad\n\n414\n00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:45.350\narea, so just saying that you're gonna\nask those people to either come out and\n\n415\n00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:49.410\nwait for someone to do that,\nto get out there, is kind of tricky.\n\n416\n00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:55.160\nSo the solution they had is they\nimplemented a remote access solution\n\n417\n00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:00.920\nthat these nurses that went out, they only\nhad to come in the office once a week,\n\n418\n00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.795\nand there was a specific reason Reason for\nthat.\n\n419\n00:23:02.795 --> 00:23:06.755\nBut what they did is they would\ncome to the office for an hour.\n\n420\n00:23:06.755 --> 00:23:09.755\nThat's all they were required to do and\nit could be any office.\n\n421\n00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:12.545\nBecause it wasn't the fact that they were\ncoming into the office to talk to them.\n\n422\n00:23:12.545 --> 00:23:14.225\nThey had to go into\nthe office to apply updates.\n\n423\n00:23:14.225 --> 00:23:17.595\nAnd they didn't want to\napply it over a slow link.\n\n424\n00:23:17.595 --> 00:23:21.025\nSo they would just make sure they got\nto one of the offices once a week.\n\n425\n00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:25.350\nBut, other than that, they record with\na notebook and their bag and all that.\n\n426\n00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.068\nAnd they would go and check on all\nthese people in their homes, and\n\n427\n00:23:29.068 --> 00:23:33.000\ndo the checkups and make sure they're ok,\nand whatever was needed.\n\n428\n00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.106\nCan you think about the fact that\nthey're going to someone's house and\n\n429\n00:23:37.106 --> 00:23:41.760\ncan use all their stuff there they're\ngiven through a mobile phone or whatever,\n\n430\n00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.430\nto connect remotely and get the person's\nrecords and see what's going on.\n\n431\n00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.033\nAnd that wouldn't be possible\nthe same way, even close.\n\n432\n00:23:50.033 --> 00:23:52.732\nWithout remote access.\n\n433\n00:23:52.732 --> 00:23:55.491\nI mean, it made those people's\nlives a lot easier, and\n\n434\n00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:57.853\nthen made some of\nthe patient's lives easier.\n\n435\n00:23:57.853 --> 00:24:00.790\nMade the nurse's live easier too,\nthat she could get down to.\n\n436\n00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:04.450\nOr the nurses period, could get\ndown to what they were there for,\n\n437\n00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:08.510\nwhich was take care of the patient, not\noh, great, I gotta stay on the phone and\n\n438\n00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.660\ndo stuff and talk about this,\nthis, and this.\n\n439\n00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.880\nIt's like, no, I can do everything\nright through the computer and\n\n440\n00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.390\nupdate the records and\nschedule, screenings or\n\n441\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.480\nwhatever they needed,\nright then, wherever they were.\n\n442\n00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.370\nI mean it's way different.\n\n443\n00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:25.990\nSo we know we need to have that,\nbut remote access, of course,\n\n444\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:30.500\nin that situation specifically,\nI just thrown in there to you, and\n\n445\n00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.520\nyou look at it, it's medical records.\n\n446\n00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.705\nYou know that you just can't have,\nI'm gonna punch in and just do whatever\n\n447\n00:24:36.705 --> 00:24:40.255\nservice I've got, my ISP I'm gonna beam\nit over that, that ain't gonna work.\n\n448\n00:24:40.255 --> 00:24:42.675\nYou've got to have certain\nlevels of security.\n\n449\n00:24:42.675 --> 00:24:46.695\nYou've got to have a VPN set up and all\nthose things to work, to securely do that.\n\n450\n00:24:46.695 --> 00:24:50.005\nIt has to be the VPN that the VA owns not.\n\n451\n00:24:50.005 --> 00:24:54.780\nOr the connection the VA owns and\nmanages can't be anyone else.\n\n452\n00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.968\nAnd they solved all that.\n\n453\n00:24:55.968 --> 00:24:59.050\nBut you're gonna have to figure out\nall that is in your specific case.\n\n454\n00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.590\nAnd what you can use.\n\n455\n00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:04.730\nBut it's obviously not going away and\nwith the access that we have,\n\n456\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.500\nnot just dial up or anything like that.\n\n457\n00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.990\nBut you think of the stuff we have\nin mobile phones and tablets.\n\n458\n00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:15.356\nSo when you have that type of stuff,\nthat's another level of security you have.\n\n459\n00:25:15.356 --> 00:25:17.323\nFortunately again,\nthose have all been addressed.\n\n460\n00:25:17.323 --> 00:25:20.968\nYou look with VPNs on,\nVPNs set up on mobile devices,\n\n461\n00:25:20.968 --> 00:25:24.010\nthey've really got that nailed down.\n\n462\n00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:28.690\nI mean it only took them a little bit to\nget that adjusted to those environments.\n\n463\n00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:34.490\nYeah, so, but you're gonna have to\naddress those things as it comes up.\n\n464\n00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.270\n>> Well very good, Sean,\n\n465\n00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:41.140\na lot of great information at securing\nour communication protocols as a big\n\n466\n00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:46.170\npart of the design of our secure\nnetwork and takes a lot of planning.\n\n467\n00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.140\nThere we gotta think about it early on.\n\n468\n00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:53.020\nA lot easier to deal with then than\nlater on in the design process.\n\n469\n00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.880\nAnything else we wanna put in here\nbefore we call this episode a wrap?\n\n470\n00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.460\n>> Not much,\n\n471\n00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:04.430\nexcept just to say with any of these\ncommunication collaboration technologies\n\n472\n00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:08.700\nThey're here, you're gonna be using\nthem if you're not already using them.\n\n473\n00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.730\nThey're all great to have.\n\n474\n00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.790\nAll these technologies,\nall the way we can communicate and\n\n475\n00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:15.920\ncollaborate have proven to be very,\nvery helpful.\n\n476\n00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.060\nChange the way we work and\nthe way we do business and And\n\n477\n00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.880\nall that good stuff that goes with it.\n\n478\n00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.640\nSo as a security person,\ndon't sit here and\n\n479\n00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.980\nsay those are a big problem for\nme bringing those things in.\n\n480\n00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.680\nThey can be a problem but how do you\nback out a lot of those problems and\n\n481\n00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.690\nmitigate them to a pretty high\ndegree when bring them in?\n\n482\n00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:37.770\nYou plan.\n\n483\n00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:44.750\nA lot of the stuff with communication\ncan be solved just by planning ahead.\n\n484\n00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.080\nThose voiceover IP\nproblems we talked about.\n\n485\n00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.300\nThose can be solved by planning ahead.\n\n486\n00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:54.808\nKnowing that yes, network traffic, but\non one hand it's like just never traffic.\n\n487\n00:26:54.808 --> 00:26:55.570\nOn the otherhand,\n\n488\n00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.120\nI have to do some additional planning\nbecause of the bandwidth programs.\n\n489\n00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.200\nIf you think ahead, a lot of\nthe people that had problems with that,\n\n490\n00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.190\nthey could have got rid of those entirely\nby upgrading their infrastructure ahead of\n\n491\n00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.740\ntime and investing it that and\nthen investing in voice-over IP,\n\n492\n00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.290\ninstead of just shoving it in\nhere instead of upgrading.\n\n493\n00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:17.870\nSo plan ahead and you can have a lot\nof things headed off at the pass.\n\n494\n00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.030\nSo don't ever forget that.\n\n495\n00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:23.663\nAnd fortunately, nowadays, why, we kind of\nmade it very generic the discussion here.\n\n496\n00:27:23.663 --> 00:27:27.188\nNowadays a lot, a lot of that\nground work has been laid and\n\n497\n00:27:27.188 --> 00:27:32.636\nthere's not just generic stuff, there's\nactually specific guidance for products.\n\n498\n00:27:32.636 --> 00:27:36.055\nAnd they even tell you hey\nhere's specific guidance, but\n\n499\n00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:39.840\nwhy our specific guides,\nisn't a one size fits all.\n\n500\n00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.020\nHere is how you can determine which\none of these things off the menu\n\n501\n00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.230\nare appropriate for you.\n\n502\n00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.400\nAnd so,\nyou could analyze your environment and\n\n503\n00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.550\nthen, apply the right things accordingly.\n\n504\n00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.280\nSo, awesome.\n\n505\n00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.470\nThat's where we wanna be.\n\n506\n00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.152\n>> Very good.\n\n507\n00:27:53.152 --> 00:27:55.550\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n508\n00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.520\nI hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n509\n00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.789\nSigning off ITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n510\n00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:59.498\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n511\n00:27:59.498 --> 00:28:00.473\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n512\n00:28:00.473 --> 00:28:06.560\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.710\nI'm your host Mike Roderic with me\ntoday is none other than Shawn Oreano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.800\nHow you doing Shawn?\n\n5\n00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.560\n>> I'm doing pretty good how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.290\n>> I'm doing great,\n\n7\n00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.180\nwe got another exciting episode of\nCompTIA Advance Security Practitioner\n\n8\n00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.240\ncoming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.420\nIn this one we're gonna be talking about\ngood old mobile device management.\n\n10\n00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.890\nSeems like we spent a little bit of\ntime on these mobile devices, and\n\n11\n00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.240\nfiguring out ways we can\nsecure them in our enterprise.\n\n12\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.350\n>> Yeah, we’ve spent time on it.\n\n13\n00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.340\nAnd, heck, I’m about ready to\nsay let’s just ban them, and\n\n14\n00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.530\nchop off their hands if they bring one in.\n\n15\n00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.328\nWho’s with me?\n\n16\n00:00:43.328 --> 00:00:43.882\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:45.278\n>> You never can have my phone.\n\n18\n00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:47.089\n>> [LAUGH] Like, never mind.\n\n19\n00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:47.809\nI don’t know.\n\n20\n00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.735\nI think some iPhone users\nout there’d be like, but no.\n\n21\n00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:53.416\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [NOISE] You know how they are.\n\n22\n00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:56.434\nI'm not saying-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:59.741\n>> So yeah, we have spent a bunch of time\n\n24\n00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:03.492\nin here talking about the issues with it.\n\n25\n00:01:03.492 --> 00:01:08.088\nSo, I don't know how much we need\nto get into that really deeply, but\n\n26\n00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:12.700\nyou should know that yeah,\nmobile devices, they're a way of life.\n\n27\n00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.200\nWe've already been there, we know the\nissues of them being lost, stolen, what\n\n28\n00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.860\nthey're doing on it, the fact that they\ncan carry all sorts of data in and out on.\n\n29\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.260\nAre they securing that data that they're\nentrusted with, and are they protecting it\n\n30\n00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.830\nin line with enterprise security protocols\nand standards, whatever our business is.\n\n31\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.170\nSo there's a lot of\nthings that go with that.\n\n32\n00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.520\nSo we know that.\n\n33\n00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.990\nThe question really comes down to after\nthat is once we know those issues.\n\n34\n00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.870\nBecause remember we do have\na risk assessment right.\n\n35\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.920\nWe do a risk assessment which\nincludes finding out threats.\n\n36\n00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.950\nAs well as the vulnerabilities we have,\nwe know all that, and\n\n37\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.680\nhow likely the seconds are to happen,\nyou know gives us our overall risk.\n\n38\n00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.410\nYou know, to have an actual exposure,\nyou know because there's one thing\n\n39\n00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.690\nhaving risk, but then the exposure is\nthe actual, you know problem there.\n\n40\n00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.010\nSo we wanna stop or minimize the chance\nof those exposures as much as possible.\n\n41\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.500\nI don't want anyone to expose themselves.\n\n42\n00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.156\nI had to say it.\n\n43\n00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:12.098\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> So\n\n44\n00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:18.130\nit does seem like the OSes on these\nmobile devices too has changed.\n\n45\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.290\nLike they actually have more support for\nenterprise security and configuration.\n\n46\n00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.480\nWhereas when they first came out,\nthere was nowhere to be found, and\n\n47\n00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.380\nwe were left scrambling try to figure\nout a way to control these devices.\n\n48\n00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.180\nNow that they've got stuff built into\nthem, I think that's a little easier.\n\n49\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.660\n>> Yeah,\nthey've gotten much better at that.\n\n50\n00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.310\nThat is a good call on that one.\n\n51\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.850\nWhen they brought out hand held devices,\n\n52\n00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.830\nit wasn't really even\npart of the equation.\n\n53\n00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.100\nIt was like, we've got a mobile device.\n\n54\n00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.330\nThat was really it.\n\n55\n00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.740\nI want to say, I know someone\nwill correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n56\n00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.340\nno biggie Is the, I wanna say Blackberry,\nor RIM they're still RIM.\n\n57\n00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.470\n>> Right.\n>> They're the ones that\n\n58\n00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.330\nreally came out with the first stuff\nthat was truly dealt with security and\n\n59\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.630\nthat's something that they\nare still kind of known for,\n\n60\n00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.660\nis that people still gravitate\ntoward to a certain degree.\n\n61\n00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.070\nSome of the entrenched users\ngravitate towards them.\n\n62\n00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.480\nbecause the fact that they've been\n\n63\n00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.170\nhaving securities as part of their\noverall formula for quite a while.\n\n64\n00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.760\nThat was something that was out there,\n\n65\n00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.658\nbut then other places have\nkind of have fallen into- have\n\n66\n00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:32.680\nother vendors fallen into line with more\ncreative solutions and better solutions.\n\n67\n00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.455\nMore robust solutions.\n\n68\n00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:39.224\nYou start seeing stuff from Microsoft.\n\n69\n00:03:39.224 --> 00:03:43.706\nThey have Mobile Device Manager\nwhich jumped in and extended and\n\n70\n00:03:43.706 --> 00:03:47.660\nadded to the SMS and\nconfiguration technology.\n\n71\n00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.400\nThen you have Samsung that went ahead and\nadded into it.\n\n72\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.740\nSamsung brought in stuff with knocks,\nlike we were talking about, and knocks is\n\n73\n00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.760\nsomething that works at the individual\nlevel, as well as the larger levels,\n\n74\n00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.750\nall the way up to enterprise, and\nso you could add on stuff for that.\n\n75\n00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.570\nSo there's been more and\n\n76\n00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.750\nmore stuff that's being done to make\nthe communications more secure.\n\n77\n00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.540\nSo, those are things we can roll and\nit makes our job a lot easier.\n\n78\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.640\nThen they've had other things.\n\n79\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.280\nIt's not just the data per se.\n\n80\n00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.310\nThere's other things that, that device\nitself introduces into the environment\n\n81\n00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.820\nthat could cause issues of security\nthat have been dealt with.\n\n82\n00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.800\nOne of the ones I personally had to deal\nwith is we went from the old what they\n\n83\n00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.060\nlike to call the candy bar style phones,\nthose old ones,\n\n84\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.270\nand the flip phones that before\nthat didn't have cameras on them.\n\n85\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.385\nAnd then all of a sudden when one\nvendor put a camera on it and\n\n86\n00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:37.225\nthat became popular.\n\n87\n00:04:37.225 --> 00:04:39.325\nWhat happened?\nEveryone puts a camera on it, and\n\n88\n00:04:39.325 --> 00:04:43.585\nthen it was very tough to get\na phone without a camera on it.\n\n89\n00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:47.305\nSo, that was really tricky for\nme, personally.\n\n90\n00:04:47.305 --> 00:04:51.915\nIt actually delayed my\nadoption of smart phones.\n\n91\n00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:56.015\nBecause there were places where I worked\nin, on the government sites, specifically.\n\n92\n00:04:56.015 --> 00:04:59.260\nThose If you had a camera on it,\nit wasn't going to come in.\n\n93\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.330\nBecause you were gonna get hurt\nif you brought those things in.\n\n94\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.250\nSo they started addressing that,\n\n95\n00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.010\nand saying well we'll start making devices\nfor that segment of the population.\n\n96\n00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.860\nBecause there's a lot of people working\nin places like that that were not\n\n97\n00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.880\ngonna buy the new devices.\n\n98\n00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.090\nSo what they started doing is saying\nwe're gonna introduce devices that don't\n\n99\n00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.110\nhave those.\n\n100\n00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.500\nAnd then that was when they started\nbringing in more robust levels of\n\n101\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.660\nencryption.\n\n102\n00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.960\nThey started bringing in stuff to encrypt\nthe SD cards that go in there, and\n\n103\n00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.220\nmaking that really good.\n\n104\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.300\nAnd so there's a number of things that\nare brought in that have helped us.\n\n105\n00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.760\nYou know a deal with,\nthis whole issue of making those devices\n\n106\n00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.900\nmuch more adaptable and\nsecure, with our environment.\n\n107\n00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.790\nYou know, so we really like that,\nbetter than the way it was in the past.\n\n108\n00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.850\nWhere it's kind of,\n\n109\n00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.070\nhey if you had a mobile device it was\nkinda up to you to be trustworthy.\n\n110\n00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.010\nAnd it only took couple higher\nprofile incidents, I want to say,\n\n111\n00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.650\nbefore they realized that's\nnot really going to work.\n\n112\n00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.410\nPeople need to jump on\nthe bandwagon as vendors and\n\n113\n00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.120\nstart doing something about it.\n\n114\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.350\nThe earliest one I can think of,\n\n115\n00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.870\nthat actually showed that there\nwas a major problem, bubbling up,\n\n116\n00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.920\npercolating up with the mobile devices as,\nyou may recall that one.\n\n117\n00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.690\nRemember there was, I almost want to\nsay it was close to a decade ago,\n\n118\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.740\nbut who knows.\n\n119\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.730\nBut I remember they somebody, there was\na case where someone bought a mobile,\n\n120\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.190\nor sold a mobile device on eBay,\nand someone else bought it.\n\n121\n00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.960\nAnd they found out,\nwhen they bought it they found a few\n\n122\n00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.250\nhundred customer records on there,\nvery sensitive customer records on it.\n\n123\n00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.620\nAnd it actually made the papers and\nstuff like that.\n\n124\n00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.240\nThe person that had it really\ndidn't think about it.\n\n125\n00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.370\nIt wasn't thought of at that point.\n\n126\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.030\nAs far as that person was,\nthey've got their old device and\n\n127\n00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.890\nthey buy their new device and\nthey don't need this one anymore.\n\n128\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.710\nI'm going to sell this one and\nmake some money.\n\n129\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.010\nI don't need it anymore.\n\n130\n00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.720\nOkay, that's all they did.\n\n131\n00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.950\nThat's a normal consumer thing to think.\n\n132\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.020\nStill think about that way now.\n\n133\n00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.010\nYou got a new car,\nyou can sell the old one.\n\n134\n00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.664\nYou get new this,\nyou get rid of the old that.\n\n135\n00:07:05.664 --> 00:07:09.357\nWell, at that time,\nthis is a phone, this is a phone.\n\n136\n00:07:09.357 --> 00:07:11.911\nThat's the way that people looked at it.\n\n137\n00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:17.100\nThere's more to these phones\nthan just a phone, right?\n\n138\n00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.990\nSo, now, unlike then,\n\n139\n00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.880\nwe know about wiping the device, or\nwe may even get rid of the device.\n\n140\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.480\nThere's businesses where if they\ndecommission a mobile phone,\n\n141\n00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.730\nit's not getting sold.\n\n142\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.350\nIt's gonna get locked up someplace or\nit's gonna get outright destroyed.\n\n143\n00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.590\nAnd some people do that too.\n\n144\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.540\nWhere they will not get rid of\ntheir old devices or sell them.\n\n145\n00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.100\nSome people will.\n\n146\n00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.950\nSome people won't.\n\n147\n00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.440\nBecause let's face it,\nthe reset functions on these devices,\n\n148\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.210\nthey aren't 100%,\nyou know there's something left behind.\n\n149\n00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.403\nIf you believe it 100% yeah I'll\nbuy some of your old phones.\n\n150\n00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:53.099\n>> I have some phones if you want,\nyou want to buy my phones.\n\n151\n00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:54.021\n[LAUGH]\n>> So but yeah you\n\n152\n00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:57.155\nsee the thing is that it\nwasn't really thought of.\n\n153\n00:07:57.155 --> 00:07:57.699\n>> Right.\n\n154\n00:07:57.699 --> 00:07:58.474\n>> But I do remember that one,\n\n155\n00:07:58.474 --> 00:08:00.685\nI think it was, I want to say it was\nBlackberry device or something like that.\n\n156\n00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:04.557\nWhat shows even though I just mentioned\nthat Blackberry as one of the ones that\n\n157\n00:08:04.557 --> 00:08:07.418\nreally get's security quite\nwell at the start with, and\n\n158\n00:08:07.418 --> 00:08:09.100\nstill does security quite well.\n\n159\n00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.050\nIt's the human element\nthat can become a problem.\n\n160\n00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.230\nYou can secure the communications\nont his all you want, but\n\n161\n00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.920\nif I leave this thing just\nsitting there unlocked, or\n\n162\n00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.240\nI do whatever with it and\ndon't pay attention to it, sell it or\n\n163\n00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.310\nwhatever, all that secure communication\nstuff goes right out the window.\n\n164\n00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.320\nSo, you really need to think about it.\n\n165\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.090\nI mean, heck, there's a lot of things\n\n166\n00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.510\nthat go into that area of managing\nthese devices effectively.\n\n167\n00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.240\n>> Yeah, as you said,\nthe technology's getting better, though.\n\n168\n00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.290\nThe phones have more security built into\nthem, and I think some of the technology\n\n169\n00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.010\nthat let's them tie them into\nthe enterprise has gotten better as well.\n\n170\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.940\nLike I look into Microsoft world I see\nthings like work folders that supports\n\n171\n00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.810\neven IOS devices as well\nas Microsoft devices.\n\n172\n00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:59.650\nAnd being able to purge corporate data\noff of a lost phone, yet leave personal\n\n173\n00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:04.170\ninformation, or if somebody leaves the\nenterprise, I can reach out and I can wipe\n\n174\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.360\nnothing to our phone, but everything\nthat has to do with corporate stuff.\n\n175\n00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.714\nSo it seems like it's slowly\ncatching up with the technology.\n\n176\n00:09:10.895 --> 00:09:11.575\n>> Yeah.\n\n177\n00:09:11.575 --> 00:09:16.115\nThey've been much better\nwith that over the last\n\n178\n00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:20.855\nseveral models of devices of even\naddressing that whole thing,\n\n179\n00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:24.092\nlike you said, of separating,\ncompartmentalizing or to go back and\n\n180\n00:09:24.092 --> 00:09:28.592\nuse a term we had in the earlier episode,\nsandboxing stuff.\n\n181\n00:09:28.592 --> 00:09:33.392\nIf you go look it up,\nthat's what KNOX does for\n\n182\n00:09:33.392 --> 00:09:36.540\nSamsung and actually creates\nsandboxes to run things in.\n\n183\n00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.210\nSo you can even assign, believe it or not,\ncan assign pin codes to stuff in NOC.\n\n184\n00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.550\nSo if you go start an application, if you\nrun it within that NOC's environment and\n\n185\n00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.580\nassign it to that, it can make sure that\nyou have your personal stuff over here and\n\n186\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.380\nyou fire up this business application, ask\nfor a pin that will actually allow you to\n\n187\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.430\nopen up a sandbox and decrypt it and\nthen go ahead and fire that off.\n\n188\n00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.650\nAnd their both running on\nthe same device at the same time.\n\n189\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:06.310\nBut, because of the way that it works\ntheir gonna act and look and behave to\n\n190\n00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.410\nyou, the same as they always were, but\nyou've got two security context there.\n\n191\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.660\nThat's something that has been\nemerging more and more and more.\n\n192\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.710\nThey tend to throw that in the category\nthe way they compartmentalize stuff\n\n193\n00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.300\nto borrow something from\nthe sift they call it.\n\n194\n00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.960\nThe Chinese walls that I've talked\nabout are compartmentalizing stuff.\n\n195\n00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.420\nIt's just a really,\nreally effective way of doing things.\n\n196\n00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.780\nDoing stuff like being able to wipe\npart of the device but not the other.\n\n197\n00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.670\nThat's a huge benefit and from a business\nstandpoint Not just security-wise, but\n\n198\n00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:42.580\nI can imagine the HR people and all the\nmesses they've had to deal with, because I\n\n199\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.400\ncan tell you, you can look it up yourself,\nthere's a lot of complaints that people\n\n200\n00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.720\nhave had where they took their device in\nto work and it said oh, well guess what?\n\n201\n00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.260\nThis thing's powerful enough\nto have my work email and\n\n202\n00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.440\nall on it too, so I'm gonna add that\non there, and then the works is up.\n\n203\n00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.000\nWe need to wipe a phone,\nit's been compromised.\n\n204\n00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.110\nAnd it gets wiped remotely.\n\n205\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.660\nAnd the person's like, well,\nwait a minute, you wiped my device but\n\n206\n00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.560\nyou wiped out all my address book and\nall this stuff.\n\n207\n00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.930\nAnd get all upset and, oh, I'm angry.\n\n208\n00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:09.940\nSo, they finally decided.\n\n209\n00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.730\nWell, we're gonna start having\npeople sign paperwork to do that.\n\n210\n00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:14.920\nStill, people are gonna be pissed.\n\n211\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.540\nNow, being able to wipe part of it but\nnot the other.\n\n212\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.589\nThat's really good because now, you're\ndoing what we use to do in the old days.\n\n213\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.190\nRemember the system admins?\n\n214\n00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.080\nI used to laugh about the system admins.\n\n215\n00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.220\nI never, ever did this,\nI was never that nerdy.\n\n216\n00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.476\n>> That's what he says.\n\n217\n00:11:30.476 --> 00:11:31.665\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] No,\n\n218\n00:11:31.665 --> 00:11:35.150\nseriously, I had other things\ngoing on as the nerdy part.\n\n219\n00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.206\nI didn't do this one.\n\n220\n00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:41.400\nSo I and I remember the old Enterprise\nAdmin guys that would have in the days of\n\n221\n00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.940\npagers, they would have their PDA sitting\nhere, those palm pilot looking thing,\n\n222\n00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.840\nthey'd have a cell phone next to it and\nthen they'd have all this stuff.\n\n223\n00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.440\nYou had down their belt like Batman some\nof them would even have the ear piece\n\n224\n00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.810\non some of them still do that and\nthey walk around.\n\n225\n00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.960\nI saw one guy, swore, if you saw him,\nif the lights were turned off and\n\n226\n00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.870\nyou saw a silhouette of him, and\n\n227\n00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.760\nthe lights flashed on him,\nthink of one of them borg from Star Trek.\n\n228\n00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.680\nYou saw the light flashing\nhere all the time.\n\n229\n00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.760\nIt's just like the guy walked around, so.\n\n230\n00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.850\n>> I had a coworker that would wear,\nhe wore two beepers.\n\n231\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.500\nHe wore them like six shooters,\nright there on his hips, just ready to go.\n\n232\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.785\n>> We've got two beepers,\none for each of you.\n\n233\n00:12:17.785 --> 00:12:21.830\n[LAUGH] So when it comes to goals then,\nwhat do we have to do?\n\n234\n00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.600\nWe know we're going to have\nto support mobile devices,\n\n235\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.260\nwe're going to have to allow them\nin our network for the most part.\n\n236\n00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.790\nI know certain high security,\n\n237\n00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.600\nvery tightly controlled environments\nmight say none at all, but for\n\n238\n00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.950\nthe average enterprise these are something\nwe're going to have to live with.\n\n239\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:37.640\nRight?\n>> Yeah,\n\n240\n00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.970\nyou're not going to get away with them.\n\n241\n00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.310\nAnd while you do have those environments\nthat don't allow them at all.\n\n242\n00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.800\nThey're definitely out there.\n\n243\n00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.390\nThere's quite a few of those but\n\n244\n00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.910\nin the overall scheme of\nthings it's a small number.\n\n245\n00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:59.040\nMost cases it's gonna be if you have\na mobile device, it can be brought in.\n\n246\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.030\nBut they'll start limiting\nthem like they do USB devices.\n\n247\n00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.970\nThat's when you'll see\njust normal USB devices,\n\n248\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.250\nyou know you can't just\nplug those things in.\n\n249\n00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.080\nThey will have certain standards\nif you're gonna bring it in.\n\n250\n00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.480\nThey're gonna say, hey,\nyou can put work stuff on it.\n\n251\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.410\nYou can get your work emails on it if you\nwant, but our policy says if you do work\n\n252\n00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.290\nemails on it and you're going to receive\nthose fine, sign the paperwork for it.\n\n253\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.760\nBut the paperwork says specifically you\nhave to have these things in place.\n\n254\n00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.160\nIt has to be patched\nwith the latest stuff.\n\n255\n00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.760\nYou're going to keep the latest\nanti-malware stuff on it.\n\n256\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:32.580\nAnd then you're going to do certain levels\nof encryption of things to keep it safe.\n\n257\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.710\nSo, there's little things\nyou can do to reach that\n\n258\n00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.580\ngoal of keeping your\nstuff safe as enterprise.\n\n259\n00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.200\nYou can definitely do that.\n\n260\n00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.530\nThere's so many features,\n\n261\n00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:47.760\neven just a plain consumer device without\nall the enterprise nonsense on it.\n\n262\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.020\nI'm not saying you've gotta go out and\n\n263\n00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.390\nto manage your device that's\nkeeping secure, you have to go use,\n\n264\n00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.550\na Microsoft mobile device manager or\nany other enterprise solution.\n\n265\n00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.140\nYou can do that.\n\n266\n00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:02.060\nYou got the bucks, got the time, got the\npatience and skills to set the thing up.\n\n267\n00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.740\nI'm not going to tell you no.\n\n268\n00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.110\nIt's your call.\n\n269\n00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.680\nBut you don't have to do\nthat in a number of cases,\n\n270\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.100\nbecause you have stuff on\nthese devices already.\n\n271\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.690\nThat you can use to reach that level\nof security anyway, or a good level of\n\n272\n00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:20.900\nsecurity anyway, that may be acceptable\nfor what you wanna accomplish.\n\n273\n00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.430\nAnd accomplished that deal of keeping\nyour stuff from being lost or\n\n274\n00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.880\nlosing control of it.\n\n275\n00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.150\nI mean, heck, even finding cell phones\nnow, it used to be that that was an extra\n\n276\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.350\nservice that you had to go for if you lost\nit and you didn't pay for that service.\n\n277\n00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.930\nOh well, you can go buy another one.\n\n278\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.060\nNowadays, you can pretty\neasily find your device.\n\n279\n00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.540\nI don't know if you're aware of it,\nI mean for consumers,\n\n280\n00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:49.740\nif you have an Android device, and\nI don't know what it is on iOS,\n\n281\n00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.900\nbut I know on Android devices,\nif you have a Google account and\n\n282\n00:14:54.900 --> 00:15:00.200\nyou've linked that Google account to\nyour Android device, you can actually,\n\n283\n00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.330\nif the location services are turned\non on your phone, you can go log into\n\n284\n00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:11.130\nthe same account on your PC some place or\njust anywhere nearby you can log into,\n\n285\n00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:15.140\nlog into it and say,\njust type into google find my phone.\n\n286\n00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:20.160\nAnd it will take a moment or two,\nand it'll ask you to log in again,\n\n287\n00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.680\njust to confirm that, so\nyou will provide your information again.\n\n288\n00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.720\nAnd it will start trying to ping\nthe phone to find out where it is.\n\n289\n00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.620\nUsually it finds it within 50 to 100 feet.\n\n290\n00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:36.010\nBut it even has, on the page that\nit brings up, you'd hit a button to\n\n291\n00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:41.925\ncause it to to ring at full volume,\nat 50 feet it's still a big area.\n\n292\n00:15:41.925 --> 00:15:44.175\nSo you hit that button and\nhear it ring and\n\n293\n00:15:44.175 --> 00:15:47.935\neven if you can't find it,\nuse the button there to wipe it remotely.\n\n294\n00:15:47.935 --> 00:15:50.950\nSo you can do that as\na consumer if you wanted.\n\n295\n00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.540\nThey stole that from iOS.\n\n296\n00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.345\nWe had that for awhile, didn't we?\n\n297\n00:15:55.345 --> 00:15:57.860\n[LAUGH]\n>> Does it work the same way?\n\n298\n00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.904\n>> Joking aside,\niOS has the Find my Phone as well.\n\n299\n00:16:00.904 --> 00:16:05.236\nYou log in to iTunes, and you can find it\non a map, you can make it set an alarm,\n\n300\n00:16:05.236 --> 00:16:08.266\nyou can call it, you can wipe it,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n301\n00:16:08.266 --> 00:16:09.973\nYeah, I knew they had something.\n\n302\n00:16:09.973 --> 00:16:11.726\nWas that something that was just\nincluded or they had to pay for?\n\n303\n00:16:11.726 --> 00:16:15.222\n>> Initially,\nI've been on it since the iPhone 3 and\n\n304\n00:16:15.222 --> 00:16:19.230\nI don't remember it being\nthere until recently.\n\n305\n00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.110\nBut it's been a few iOS's where\nit's just been part of it.\n\n306\n00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.060\nYou do have to sign up for it.\n\n307\n00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.470\nYou have to make sure it's configured.\n\n308\n00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.560\nSo it's not really an Enterprise thing.\n\n309\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.530\nIt's done on an individual iTunes account.\n\n310\n00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.752\nI don't know if there is any\nEnterprise type solution.\n\n311\n00:16:31.752 --> 00:16:35.430\nCuz that's one of the issues here, you\ntalk about how these devices are secure or\n\n312\n00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.890\nwe can configure them to be secure.\n\n313\n00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.665\nBut if I have got a thousand,ten thousand,\na hundred-thousand employees, where\n\n314\n00:16:42.665 --> 00:16:47.655\ntwenty, thirty different models of phones,\nthat is where the big challenge comes in.\n\n315\n00:16:47.655 --> 00:16:54.090\n>> Yeah, absolutely, you have to have a\nunified or more robust solution than this.\n\n316\n00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:58.560\nThese things will work fine for\na small business, something like that, but\n\n317\n00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:04.080\ngetting beyond that, probably not gonna\nbe something that's really practical.\n\n318\n00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.390\nI don't know if Google Service scales\nup that way, cuz I do know they offer\n\n319\n00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.190\nEnterprise mail and apps and stuff\nlike that so you can get those things.\n\n320\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.424\nI don't know if this is something that\n\n321\n00:17:13.635 --> 00:17:18.335\nyou can get included in\nthe same type of service.\n\n322\n00:17:18.335 --> 00:17:22.756\nActually I used to [CROSSTALK], I'm even\ncurious, I don't know if you know this,\n\n323\n00:17:22.756 --> 00:17:25.595\nbecause I don't mess with\nthe Apple devices at all.\n\n324\n00:17:25.595 --> 00:17:30.157\nBut, it makes me curious to see if you\nlinked your Gmail account to Apple,\n\n325\n00:17:30.157 --> 00:17:31.860\nwould it work the same way?\n\n326\n00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.903\n>> Oh, would it?\n\n327\n00:17:32.903 --> 00:17:33.520\n>> I'm curious.\n\n328\n00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.660\n>> Yeah, probably.\n\n329\n00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.520\nI know that iOS, for example.\n\n330\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.590\nAnd I'm sure, with others, as well.\n\n331\n00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:44.220\nMy folks used to work at UF, and\nto connect to their networks their policy\n\n332\n00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.000\nwas, your phone had to\nbe set with a PIN code.\n\n333\n00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.320\nAnd it had to have encryption enabled, and\n\n334\n00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.250\nif you disabled any of those,\nyou could no longer VPN in.\n\n335\n00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.150\nYour VPN access would be gone.\n\n336\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.600\nThey were doing that programmatically.\n\n337\n00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.980\nIt wasn't like they, so,\nas soon as you turn the PIN code back on,\n\n338\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.030\nall of a sudden you can VPN\nback into their network so.\n\n339\n00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.250\nControls are getting there.\n\n340\n00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.680\nYou gotta figure out which\nones you need to use.\n\n341\n00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.710\n>> So they were using a script to do\na network access protection type thing?\n\n342\n00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:09.880\n>> I believe that's what they're doing.\n\n343\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.810\nI wasn't privy to the information\non the other side.\n\n344\n00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.370\nI had to help them set it up.\n\n345\n00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.000\nBut, I was experimenting with it,\nof course.\n\n346\n00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.430\nAnd I was like,\nwhat happens if I turn it off.\n\n347\n00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.440\nWhat if I don't want to use a PIN code?\n\n348\n00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.650\nAnd sure enough, you'd lose your\nability just to create that connection.\n\n349\n00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.620\n>> That's pretty cool.\n\n350\n00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.350\nThat's a good way to go.\n\n351\n00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.530\n>> And Michaela,\nout there, had a question.\n\n352\n00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.619\nWhat's your view on whether we\nshould provide web filtering for\n\n353\n00:18:28.619 --> 00:18:31.779\ncorporate mobile devices\nconnected to non-corporate wi-fi.\n\n354\n00:18:31.779 --> 00:18:35.910\nAnd when they aren't using VPN for\ncorporate business.\n\n355\n00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:40.410\nSo in other words, when I've got a\ncorporate phone and I'm out traveling and\n\n356\n00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.190\nI'm doing personal web surfing from\nStarbucks, is that the scenario?\n\n357\n00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.390\nAnd we'll give Michaela, I know we've\ngot a couple minute lag there or\n\n358\n00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.320\na 30 second lag, so we'll give\nher a chance to respond to that.\n\n359\n00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.790\nI think that's what she's referring to.\n\n360\n00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:57.492\n>> I think David also gave us the answer\nin here as Android Device Manager.\n\n361\n00:18:57.492 --> 00:19:00.720\nI guess that must be the Enterprise\nsolution for doing this, so.\n\n362\n00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.398\nIf I'm reading that right.\n\n363\n00:19:02.398 --> 00:19:03.501\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n364\n00:19:03.501 --> 00:19:08.420\n>> I'll take a look at that cuz that's a\n>> That would\n\n365\n00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.080\nbe a really powerful solution.\n\n366\n00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.120\nBut there's bunches of\nsolutions out there.\n\n367\n00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.940\nI know for doing different types of\nmanagement, that sounds like another one,\n\n368\n00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.430\nso I'll take a look at that.\n\n369\n00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:19.440\nThanks for that.\n\n370\n00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.250\n>> It really does show you though that the\nproliferation of mobile devices has lead\n\n371\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.660\nto things like that, and it's now\npossible to start managing the devices\n\n372\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.050\n>> At an Enterprise level,\n\n373\n00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.890\nthrough a corporate environment, and not\nhaving to do it through instructions that\n\n374\n00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.920\nI give to each one of my users and\nhoping that they comply with that.\n\n375\n00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.660\nYou know things like that, that obviously\nis not going to work very well.\n\n376\n00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.500\nChallenges that we have with\nour mobile devices, you know,\n\n377\n00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.170\nwe've already listed quite a few.\n\n378\n00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:46.280\nI think biggest one,\n\n379\n00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:51.130\nSean, are probably just the number\nof different devices and OS's.\n\n380\n00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:54.510\nYou were talking yesterday\nabout even version numbers and\n\n381\n00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.830\ndifferent versions between\nvendors on the same OS platform.\n\n382\n00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.254\n>> Yeah, when you get down to it,\nI mean let's look at this one way.\n\n383\n00:20:04.254 --> 00:20:08.070\nI've got,\nlike from a real world situation here,\n\n384\n00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.710\nI've got you know my two\nmobile devices here.\n\n385\n00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:16.730\nBoth running Android and then I have a,\nyou know, with me also I have a tablet.\n\n386\n00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:17.890\nYou know a Lenovo tablet.\n\n387\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.750\nSo I have a LG Nexus 5,\nI have Samsung Galaxy 4,\n\n388\n00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:25.608\nand then I've got a Lenovo Idea Pad.\n\n389\n00:20:25.608 --> 00:20:31.830\nSo all of those run\nthe Android operating system.\n\n390\n00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.600\nNone of them are the same.\n\n391\n00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.603\nAll the same version,\nnone of them are the same.\n\n392\n00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:38.668\n>> Well why would you do that Sean?\n\n393\n00:20:38.668 --> 00:20:39.680\n>> It doesn't make sense right?\n\n394\n00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.260\nI mean c'mon.\n\n395\n00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.085\nWhy not?\n\n396\n00:20:41.085 --> 00:20:42.467\nThat sounds fun.\n\n397\n00:20:42.467 --> 00:20:46.208\nThey were like, it's just Fate's\nout there going, Okay, Mr.\n\n398\n00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:50.750\nComputer Guy, oh Security Guy,\nsorry, let's give you one.\n\n399\n00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:55.380\nIt's crazy and it's what makes\n\n400\n00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.928\na situation with the multiple OS's\neven exasperates to a high degree.\n\n401\n00:20:59.928 --> 00:21:04.300\nIs that, if you get down to it,\nyou may be out there and\n\n402\n00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.080\nget your device from your vendor.\n\n403\n00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.840\nAnd you're like oh, okay,\nthis is great, so you go out and\n\n404\n00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.500\nsign your contract with them.\n\n405\n00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:16.005\nYou could do this here today, I'm sure,\nif we got in the car and went down\n\n406\n00:21:16.005 --> 00:21:21.899\nto the mall or a couple places around\nhere, we went by a couple of stores here.\n\n407\n00:21:21.899 --> 00:21:24.900\nWe went to like a, you know,\nlet's say we went to an AT&T or\n\n408\n00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.560\nVerizon store or whatever, and we started\nto go through the mobile devices in there.\n\n409\n00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.900\nYou'd see some of them were\nrunning old versions of Android.\n\n410\n00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.250\nWell, older to what we have now.\n\n411\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.570\nAndroid's at like, what, Lollipop I\nthink it's 5.2 or 5.1 or something now?\n\n412\n00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.730\nYou'd find ones that\nare running 4.4 in there.\n\n413\n00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:46.120\nAnd the thing is is that the provider\nthemselves may not release\n\n414\n00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.680\nthe new one yet.\n\n415\n00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.520\nThe may be still be going though their\nown little process of tweaking it and\n\n416\n00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.680\nmonkeying with it, whatever,\nfor their own devices.\n\n417\n00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.650\nWhereas if you go to another device, it's\ngot the newest one because that vendor's\n\n418\n00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.140\ngotten their game and said,\nOkay, just put it out there.\n\n419\n00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.640\nAnd then you get to the unlock devices,\nlike I have this one,\n\n420\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.210\nthis one's completely unlocked and\nrooted and everything.\n\n421\n00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.400\nI can get the latest everything on this.\n\n422\n00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.970\nI can get up to the minute stuff\non this if I want to go that far.\n\n423\n00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.890\nSo, from a corporate standpoint, while\nyou may not want to rooted device on your\n\n424\n00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.900\nnetwork, that would be something\nthat would be a big security issue.\n\n425\n00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.425\nFrom the other side of things,\nother side of things,\n\n426\n00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:26.495\nit's like well what if that older version,\nthat OS, if you called up, you know,\n\n427\n00:22:26.495 --> 00:22:31.225\nlet's say you called AT&T and\nthe device you had was using 4.4 and\n\n428\n00:22:31.225 --> 00:22:35.205\nyou knew that 4.4 cuz the stuff\nyou've read and seen.\n\n429\n00:22:35.205 --> 00:22:37.245\nYou look at it and say,\nwell there's some problems with that,\n\n430\n00:22:37.245 --> 00:22:39.425\nsome big security problems.\n\n431\n00:22:39.425 --> 00:22:44.255\nI wanna get that patched because we've\nall been trained as IT people and\n\n432\n00:22:44.255 --> 00:22:45.570\nnot to mention security people.\n\n433\n00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.080\nif there's patches\nsomebody's got available,\n\n434\n00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.520\nespecially for critical problems.\n\n435\n00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.170\nGet off your butt and evaluate it,\n\n436\n00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:58.340\nsee if there's something for it and\nput it on your device as soon as you can.\n\n437\n00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.110\nEspecially if it's zero day.\n\n438\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.810\nSo, we know that.\n\n439\n00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:03.700\nWe've been trained on that.\n\n440\n00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:10.530\nBut what if it's a situation where you\ncan't apply cuz they won't give it to you.\n\n441\n00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:11.973\nThink of it in these terms.\n\n442\n00:23:11.973 --> 00:23:15.510\nWhat if Microsoft or\none of its operating systems,\n\n443\n00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.480\nwe'll say Windows 10,\nyou know cuz it just came out.\n\n444\n00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:24.010\nLet's just say for sake of argument,\nWindows 10, it's been out and\n\n445\n00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.420\nMicrosoft releases Service Pack 1.\n\n446\n00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.010\nThey find something and\nthey find enough problems that hey,\n\n447\n00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.740\nService Pack 1's gotta\nbe released right now.\n\n448\n00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:36.005\nCan you imagine a situation where they\nrelease Service Pack 1 and they're saying.\n\n449\n00:23:36.005 --> 00:23:39.476\nOkay, everybody on a Dell computer,\nyou guys get it.\n\n450\n00:23:39.476 --> 00:23:42.025\nYou guys on Lenovo, you guys get it.\n\n451\n00:23:42.025 --> 00:23:43.040\nOkay, who else is out there?\n\n452\n00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.030\nHP guys?\nI don't hear you, you don't get it.\n\n453\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.136\nWhy not?\n\n454\n00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:50.700\nWe'll get around to you, you know.\n\n455\n00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.379\nHP's gotta put some branding or\nsomething in it, we don't know but\n\n456\n00:23:53.379 --> 00:23:55.410\nthey're going to take care of it though.\n\n457\n00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.380\nYou know you don't get it.\n\n458\n00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.800\nThese guys get it, but you don't.\n\n459\n00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.710\nHow ridiculous is that?\n\n460\n00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:02.754\n>> Right.\n>> That situation,\n\n461\n00:24:02.754 --> 00:24:04.553\nit's just really ridiculous to hear.\n\n462\n00:24:04.553 --> 00:24:07.897\nThat's really what's happening, and\nthat just makes your life easier.\n\n463\n00:24:07.897 --> 00:24:09.608\nCan you imagine that,\n\n464\n00:24:09.608 --> 00:24:15.020\nin your environment if you had a If\nyou were told that you have a version.\n\n465\n00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.320\nI mean heck it's actually worse than that.\n\n466\n00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.956\nIf I really want to mess\nwith you I could say well,\n\n467\n00:24:21.956 --> 00:24:26.785\nwhat if you were those people\nthat upgraded to Vista let's say.\n\n468\n00:24:26.785 --> 00:24:30.770\nWe got Vista on there and then Windows 7\ncomes out and they're doing the same thing\n\n469\n00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.280\nit's like, hey you Dell guys and\nyou Nova guys get it.\n\n470\n00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.050\nEveryone else hey, to heck with them,\nthey don't get it yet,\n\n471\n00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:39.672\nwon't get it in two years or maybe,\nmaybe won't give it to them at all.\n\n472\n00:24:39.672 --> 00:24:40.730\nNever get Windows 7.\n\n473\n00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.770\nThey have to stay on Vista for\n\n474\n00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.935\nthe rest of their lives as long\nas they keep those computers.\n\n475\n00:24:43.935 --> 00:24:45.840\n[LAUGH]\n>> Can you imagine that?\n\n476\n00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.260\nSo it's nonsense, and\nthat just makes our life easier, or sorry,\n\n477\n00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:55.580\nlife more difficult than it should be, and\nthat's just the technical side of the OSs.\n\n478\n00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.965\nAs far as the other challenges we get,\nthose challenges we get with these things,\n\n479\n00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:02.720\nis technology is a great thing.\n\n480\n00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.210\nIt can help us out, and do a lot of stuff.\n\n481\n00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:09.130\nBut all the things we can do,\nwe can make the best ironclad,\n\n482\n00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.060\nbuild a little force field and everything\naround this device, whatever we want,\n\n483\n00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.170\nsay oh, it's nice and secure.\n\n484\n00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.420\nAnd say, oh, that's great.\n\n485\n00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:20.950\nNothing is gonna stop me from going\nthrough a checkpoint at an airport,\n\n486\n00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:25.530\nlet's say, security at an airport and\nI'm devesting myself of all my things.\n\n487\n00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:27.280\nI go through the machine, get checked, and\n\n488\n00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.540\nthen I'm walking away going hey maybe I've\ngot time to get something to eat before.\n\n489\n00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:36.760\nMy phone's sitting back there on\nthe system, so, people do that.\n\n490\n00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.750\nTechnology can't help you one bit there.\n\n491\n00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:43.040\nIf you leave it behind,\ntechnology can tell you where it is.\n\n492\n00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.080\nIf you do find my phone or\nwhatever it is on IOS, you do that.\n\n493\n00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.270\nIt doesn't make the phone magically\nwalk over to you and appear, you know,\n\n494\n00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.540\nbeam itself into your pocket.\n\n495\n00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.780\nYou still have to go find it and\ngo get it and\n\n496\n00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.740\nhope that someone didn't mess with it or\nwhatever in the meantime.\n\n497\n00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:01.940\nSo you can't protect yourself\nfrom the human element too.\n\n498\n00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:06.660\nSo those are big challenges, but\nfortunately, as far as it walking away and\n\n499\n00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.250\nand someone's stealing it or\nlosing it, what have you.\n\n500\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.000\nWe've known that for awhile.\n\n501\n00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.100\nAnd so what's happened is that\nwe're taking precautions.\n\n502\n00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.280\nWe can't stop them from getting lost or\nstolen.\n\n503\n00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.590\nWe can't protect ourselves from\npeople being just plain old dumb.\n\n504\n00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.840\nWith these things, but what we can do\nis make sure someone else gets it,\n\n505\n00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.990\nthey don't get access to our data.\n\n506\n00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.140\nThat's the critical aspect.\n\n507\n00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:31.270\nI can replace a phone, I can get another\none of these and put stuff on it.\n\n508\n00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.040\nWhat I can't get is if someone\nloses control of that data\n\n509\n00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.700\nI can't put the genie back in the bottle.\n\n510\n00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.440\nSo that's the big challenge,\nwe dealt with that.\n\n511\n00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:41.710\nThankfully they have.\n\n512\n00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:45.990\nI'll tell you, if you know somebody\nthat works in the travel industry,\n\n513\n00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:47.560\nlike airlines.\n\n514\n00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.380\nHacked, you know,\n\n515\n00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.170\nso that works specifically, you know,\nyou either go on the aircraft or\n\n516\n00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:56.500\nfix them and you gotta come to the gate or\ncleaning them up at night.\n\n517\n00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.900\nEspecially the people having to clean\nthem up at night and do stuff like that.\n\n518\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.440\nAsk them how many stuff like tablets,\nand iPads, and phones, and\n\n519\n00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.720\nstuff like that they found.\n\n520\n00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.250\nThey find them all the time.\n\n521\n00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.861\nAll the time,\nbecause people take these things out and\n\n522\n00:27:11.861 --> 00:27:14.880\n[SOUND] put them in the back of the seat,\nlean back and whatever.\n\n523\n00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.750\nIt's time to go.\n\n524\n00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.790\nOh, here, I put all my stuff in my bag and\ntake off.\n\n525\n00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.280\nThey forget the thing's in there.\n\n526\n00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.480\nIt's gotten to the point where\nthe flight attendants, they tell you.\n\n527\n00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.490\nI flew out here,\nthe flight attendants were saying.\n\n528\n00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.830\nYeah make sure you get your stuff.\n\n529\n00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.930\nWhen you, get your tablet and everything\noff here when you get off the plane.\n\n530\n00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:30.680\nOkay.\n\n531\n00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.680\nAnd she says,\nyou don't believe how often that happens.\n\n532\n00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I actually do believe it.\n\n533\n00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:39.390\nMy dad was an aircraft mechanic for\n35 years and my brother does that know so.\n\n534\n00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:43.170\nAnd they would go, he would go, my dad\nwhen he went into the plane to fix things.\n\n535\n00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.260\nQuite often you,\nyou really find stuff in there, I mean.\n\n536\n00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:53.070\nAnd their policy is, most airlines\nwith most places, it gets found.\n\n537\n00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:56.330\nIt gets put in the lost and\nfound for 30 days, and\n\n538\n00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:00.680\nif people don't pick it up whoever\nfound it is the one that gets it back.\n\n539\n00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.850\nYou hear people, the stuff that people\nleave behind, you're like are you kidding?\n\n540\n00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:05.840\nI mean really, you did that?\n\n541\n00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.540\nYou see people leave behind like\nexpensive cameras, and computers,\n\n542\n00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:15.310\nand all sorts of things, so\nit hasn't gotten anything.\n\n543\n00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:16.220\nIt hasn't decreased,\n\n544\n00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.950\nbut now the technology, it's no longer\njust like books and stuff like that.\n\n545\n00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.050\nNow, it's these devices.\n\n546\n00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:26.590\nSo I can't stop doing that there\nexcept maybe make you pay for it.\n\n547\n00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:34.382\n>> Kind of makes me curious if my phone\nwas at 30,000 feet, flying across the US.\n\n548\n00:28:34.382 --> 00:28:35.182\nInteresting.\n\n549\n00:28:35.182 --> 00:28:38.050\n>> [LAUGH] You'd know all of\nthe sudden ring because also that\n\n550\n00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.610\nplane would be landing like in Denver,\n\n551\n00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.720\nand the federal agents would be,\nall right, what's going on?\n\n552\n00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.130\n>> [LAUGH] And\nI know we're getting short on time, but\n\n553\n00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.930\nI did wanna get to one more topic there.\n\n554\n00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:51.050\nWe're talking about secure implementation\nof collaboration platforms,\n\n555\n00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.680\nanother thing that we're seeing more and\nmore of in our enterprise.\n\n556\n00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.112\nBecause we've mentioned it a couple\ntimes in previous episodes,\n\n557\n00:28:58.112 --> 00:29:01.370\npeople are not having to come in\nto the office to do work as much.\n\n558\n00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:05.426\nWe're able to set up branch offices and\nremote offices anywhere and everywhere we\n\n559\n00:29:05.426 --> 00:29:09.470\nwant because of the availability\nof the internet and networking.\n\n560\n00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.440\nHomes, hotels, wherever they happen to be.\n\n561\n00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.140\nSo we end up needing to bring everybody\nback together, but we do it with things\n\n562\n00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.700\nlike video conferencing or\nweb conferencing and things like that.\n\n563\n00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.450\nAnd that brings another set of\nsecurity concerns in, right?\n\n564\n00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:23.630\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n565\n00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:27.640\nCollaboration with all things\nthat can be done with it, great!\n\n566\n00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.860\nWe love the fact that it has really made\nthese distributed work places possible.\n\n567\n00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.590\nBusinesses don't have to have everyone\ncome into the office all the time.\n\n568\n00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.680\nThat's not as necessary as it used to be.\n\n569\n00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.560\nI'll be one of the first\npeople to tell you,\n\n570\n00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.100\nnot every position is suited to that,\nbut a lot of them are.\n\n571\n00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.160\nBut the problem with that always was,\n\n572\n00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.560\nwhen people start going remote, then how\nare they gonna build that closeness and\n\n573\n00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.580\nactually build that team type of\nrelationship and work effectively?\n\n574\n00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.230\nSo instead of us doing all\nthe nonsense we had before or\n\n575\n00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.320\nhaving to email documents around and\n\n576\n00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.340\nmaking sure that we email it out to\na bunch of people and it all changes.\n\n577\n00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.670\nNow I gotta sit there and\ncopy and paste and do all that.\n\n578\n00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:12.490\nWe got rid of all that by doing stuff\nlike any of the collaboration platforms.\n\n579\n00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:16.090\nI can look at stuff like\nSharePoint would be one.\n\n580\n00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.620\nPlus there's a bunch of\nother one's that allow that.\n\n581\n00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:23.190\nSo great, but\nthe thing is that security aspect of it.\n\n582\n00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:27.690\nFortunately most of the products\nnow a days have included that.\n\n583\n00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:32.850\nSharePoint's one,\nit does have a security mechanisms in it.\n\n584\n00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.430\nBut the thing is you have to be\naware of the security mechanisms and\n\n585\n00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:36.220\nreally pay attention.\n\n586\n00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.070\nThat's one of the cases\nwhere I would tell you,\n\n587\n00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:43.080\nI am not necessarily either\nway on the outsourcing thing.\n\n588\n00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.140\nAs far as outsourcing hosting services for\n\n589\n00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.670\nsomeone else, I'm not, some it's for,\nsome it's against it, either way.\n\n590\n00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:52.080\nIt's one of those things that if\nthere's a place for it, let's do it.\n\n591\n00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.970\nIf there's not a place for it or\nit's too much of a risk, don't do it.\n\n592\n00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:59.140\nThat's the way I look at\nit with any technology.\n\n593\n00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:03.060\nSo if you're someone that can't\nmanage the security stuff for it, for\n\n594\n00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.110\ninformation on something like SharePoint,\nI will just pick on that for a bit.\n\n595\n00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.110\nIf you are going to implement\nthe SharePoint site,\n\n596\n00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.110\nyou want to have all the stuff\nthat goes with that, hey awesome.\n\n597\n00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.580\nIf you did that research.\n\n598\n00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.270\nIf you are not someone that can\ndo that administration of it and\n\n599\n00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:19.670\nsecuring of it,\nthe way it needs to be done,\n\n600\n00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:23.470\nthen maybe it's best that you\noutsource as much of that as you can.\n\n601\n00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.621\nHost it someplace else,\npay the money for it, and\n\n602\n00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:29.330\nthen you can do some administration of it.\n\n603\n00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.462\nSo if you wanna have those nice\nSSL connections, from people who\n\n604\n00:31:32.462 --> 00:31:36.522\nare logging in to protect everything and\nexchange of that, let them worry about how\n\n605\n00:31:36.522 --> 00:31:40.980\nto install a certificate, and how to\ngenerate it and do all that type of stuff.\n\n606\n00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.020\nYou can worry about who's\ngot an account on there.\n\n607\n00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.970\nMuch easier.\n\n608\n00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.190\nThat is something to think about.\n\n609\n00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:51.210\nIf you can't handle what these\ncollaboration solutions, I would\n\n610\n00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:55.540\nsay almost every collaboration solution,\nyou can disagree with me on this one.\n\n611\n00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.260\nI would say just about every\ncollaboration solution,\n\n612\n00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.810\nI won't say it's heck to set up,\nbut I'll say it's a challenge.\n\n613\n00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:03.313\nIt's a big challenge.\n\n614\n00:32:03.313 --> 00:32:07.031\n>> It definitely is and SharePoint is\nthe one I have the familiarity with, and\n\n615\n00:32:07.031 --> 00:32:10.335\nit can get rather complex rather\nquickly with certain solutions so\n\n616\n00:32:10.335 --> 00:32:13.063\nyou really gotta pay attention\nto what you're doing.\n\n617\n00:32:13.063 --> 00:32:15.814\nYeah, you can't take these things for\ngranted.\n\n618\n00:32:15.814 --> 00:32:20.004\nImagine that when you start factoring\ninto this with this collaboration,\n\n619\n00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:21.867\ncuz unified messaging systems or\n\n620\n00:32:21.867 --> 00:32:26.490\ncommunications systems are sitting\nin the same zip code as this stuff.\n\n621\n00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:29.193\nThat's a whole nother challenge\ngoing on top of that.\n\n622\n00:32:29.193 --> 00:32:33.651\nSo to implement these sayings, you've\ngot to think about, can you handle it?\n\n623\n00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:36.460\nThey've made it easier,\nbut can you handle it?\n\n624\n00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:40.510\nI would always ask from a security\nstandpoint, if we're gonna be doing this\n\n625\n00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:45.040\ncollaboration immediately starts bringing\nin stuff, the communication issue.\n\n626\n00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.210\nSo we're talking about all that.\n\n627\n00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:51.580\nFirst of all, do you that whole data at\nrest and data traveling aspect of it.\n\n628\n00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:55.520\nWhat are you doing, or what can we\ndo to secure it, wherever it sits?\n\n629\n00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.820\nAnd then what can we do when\npeople are talking to it?\n\n630\n00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:01.070\nThat's really the two areas\nthat we need to be focusing on.\n\n631\n00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:04.960\nIs there a good decent layer\nof security with that,\n\n632\n00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.410\nis there a way to audit\nthis type of stuff?\n\n633\n00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:10.871\nThat's something I also wanna see is that\nif I have people distributed all over\n\n634\n00:33:10.871 --> 00:33:11.770\nthe place.\n\n635\n00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:15.760\nI want to have a way to audit\nwho is doing what, track that.\n\n636\n00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.940\nSo if there's a problem, I can track it\ndown to a specific time, specific user and\n\n637\n00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.410\nbe like, what the heck are you doing?\n\n638\n00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.710\nI can see those sorts of things.\n\n639\n00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:29.070\nSo, being able to secure the data plus\nbeing able to have accountability on it,\n\n640\n00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.780\nis a big thing as far as that goes.\n\n641\n00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.830\nAnd then also try to think of\nthe clients that are connecting\n\n642\n00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.280\nto your collaboration solutions.\n\n643\n00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.030\nWhat do they have and\nwhat do they support?\n\n644\n00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:43.028\nOne of the things I don't want to see is\nI don't want to see older devices that\n\n645\n00:33:43.028 --> 00:33:47.030\nsupport only legacy protocols being\nable to attach to my newer solution that\n\n646\n00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.548\nI've spent all this time and\neffort securing.\n\n647\n00:33:49.548 --> 00:33:51.089\nBecause if I have to make it so\n\n648\n00:33:51.089 --> 00:33:54.950\nit's compatible with those legacy\ndevices that can't be upgraded for\n\n649\n00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:59.022\nwhatever reason, that may mean I gotta\nimplement old technologies here.\n\n650\n00:33:59.022 --> 00:34:02.351\nWhich renders a lot of the stuff\nI've done so far moot.\n\n651\n00:34:02.351 --> 00:34:03.269\nI don't want that.\n\n652\n00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:09.780\nSo, that's something else to kind of roll\ninto that overall solution that you have.\n\n653\n00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.720\nBut you can do it.\n\n654\n00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.446\nYou can do it quite well when\nyou do a collaboration solution.\n\n655\n00:34:13.446 --> 00:34:18.570\nYou can make a very secure solution\nthat can be used by all mobile users and\n\n656\n00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:21.510\ncan swap all sorts of documents, files,\n\n657\n00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:25.206\ncommunications, you can do\nall of that in one shot.\n\n658\n00:34:25.206 --> 00:34:29.294\nYou just have to really look at\nthe various issues, and like I said,\n\n659\n00:34:29.294 --> 00:34:34.319\nprobably the biggest one I would think of\nthat's a challenge as far as implementing\n\n660\n00:34:34.319 --> 00:34:39.230\nsecurely is if you're aware of all the\nissues of securing it, storing the data.\n\n661\n00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.222\nHow you're gonna store the data and\nas well as making it accessible and\n\n662\n00:34:42.222 --> 00:34:44.630\nsecure when it's traveling back and forth?\n\n663\n00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.990\nAnd how to track that type of stuff.\n\n664\n00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:49.110\nOnce you can get that out of the way,\n\n665\n00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:52.490\nyou're actually in pretty good\nshape once you have that.\n\n666\n00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:55.160\nBut like I said, bring the legacy\nsolutions in stuff like that,\n\n667\n00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:58.690\nit's gonna actually\nrepresent a huge challenge.\n\n668\n00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:02.060\nBut if you can't do all those challenge,\nyou can't meet them.\n\n669\n00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.270\nThen by all means, outsource it.\n\n670\n00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:11.290\nGet it so someone else,\nif you want SharePoint, go to Microsoft or\n\n671\n00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.080\nwhoever, cuz they're not the only\nones that offer hosted SharePoint.\n\n672\n00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.130\nGo to them and start figuring out,\nhey, it costs this much.\n\n673\n00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:21.960\nAnd if your bean counters, as we like to\nsay, start looking at it and saying well,\n\n674\n00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.820\nthat's gonna be a little too expensive for\nus to do, if we did it in house,\n\n675\n00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.150\nit'd be cheaper.\n\n676\n00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:31.150\nWell, maybe it'd be cheaper depending on\nhow you look at it if you do it in house.\n\n677\n00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:32.940\nWhat's the cost of a security breach?\n\n678\n00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.240\nBecause we don't have it.\n\n679\n00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.160\nAnd it doesn't need to be\na permanent solution that way.\n\n680\n00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.350\nYou could easily make it so if you have\nSharePoint hosted with someone else,\n\n681\n00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:42.210\nyou can have a URL that resolve to\nthat when you move it internally and\n\n682\n00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.530\nexport the data from that over\ninto your internal stuff.\n\n683\n00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.475\nCome on.\nWe all should know how to update something\n\n684\n00:35:48.475 --> 00:35:52.000\nin DNS, a record in there to make that\npoint over here instead of over there.\n\n685\n00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:55.090\n>> All right.\nWell again, a lot of great information but\n\n686\n00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:58.470\nunfortunately, that's gonna do it for\ntime on this episode.\n\n687\n00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.170\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n688\n00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:02.131\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n689\n00:36:02.131 --> 00:36:03.339\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n690\n00:36:03.339 --> 00:36:04.270\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:15.620\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nand with me today,\n\n4\n00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.920\nis none other than Mr Sean Oriano,\nhow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.800\n>> I am doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.530\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.820\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.010\nExcited, because we got another one of our\nCompTia advanced security practitioner\n\n9\n00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.360\nepisodes coming your way, and in this one,\nwe're gonna be talking about,\n\n10\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.610\nnot just authentication but\nadvanced authentication techniques.\n\n11\n00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.140\n>> That sounds awesome,\nI like advanced authentication.\n\n12\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.302\nYeah so, its like you guys should be\ndoing those books that I signed for you,\n\n13\n00:00:39.302 --> 00:00:40.812\nsee it's authenticated.\n\n14\n00:00:40.812 --> 00:00:42.202\n>> [LAUGH] So what do we mean,\n\n15\n00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:46.684\nwe understand that we've gone through\nsecurity plus, some things like that.\n\n16\n00:00:46.684 --> 00:00:50.250\nWe've got a pretty good idea of what\nAuthentication is, choosing a good,\n\n17\n00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.190\nstrong authentication method, Cerberus,\nor whatever protocol you're using for\n\n18\n00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.220\nthat authentication.\n\n19\n00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.177\nMaking sure that it encrypts the password,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n20\n00:00:59.177 --> 00:01:02.727\nWhat are we talking about when we talk\nabout advanced authentication in this\n\n21\n00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:03.400\ncase, Sean?\n\n22\n00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.040\n>> Well,\nwe are building on what you just said.\n\n23\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.690\nWe're building on those already\nexisting authentication techniques and\n\n24\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.340\nthen just bumping it up\nto a whole new level.\n\n25\n00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.650\nAnd really what it means when\nyou get to this level is,\n\n26\n00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.570\nthe complexity just bumped up by several\norders of magnitude in some cases.\n\n27\n00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.680\nBut this is a very real situation\n\n28\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.200\nthat you are going to encounter or already\nhave encountered, as the case may be.\n\n29\n00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.240\nNow for us, there's really just\ntwo main areas of authentication,\n\n30\n00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.030\nor advanced authentication,\nthat come to the surface.\n\n31\n00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.010\nOne of them is using certificates,\nwhich we'll get to.\n\n32\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.310\nAnd then the other one is, really\none that you hear about quite a bit,\n\n33\n00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.070\nyou may already be implementing it,\nI know of quite a few businesses are,\n\n34\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.750\nnow that it's become easier than it was.\n\n35\n00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.810\nYou're not going to hear me say,\noh it's easy.\n\n36\n00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.610\nIt is doing it with the call\nfederated identity management.\n\n37\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.789\nIt's something that because it's an\nauthentication technology, it immediately,\n\n38\n00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.940\nonce you say authentication technology,\nwhere does it go?\n\n39\n00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.243\nBoom, it's an IT and a security thing.\n\n40\n00:02:09.243 --> 00:02:15.499\nSo, it's right in our thinking, in our\nthought process is a design all that, so\n\n41\n00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:21.028\nthose are the two really, those\nare the two advancements we have here.\n\n42\n00:02:21.028 --> 00:02:25.463\nI'm sure if we gave it time, and we start\ndoing brainstorming here with the audience\n\n43\n00:02:25.463 --> 00:02:29.779\nand all that, we could get a lot more\nother advanced authentication mechanisms.\n\n44\n00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.415\nBut these to be fair, and\nto make it nice and simple,\n\n45\n00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:39.280\nthese are the ones that are gonna figure\non your exam in some way, shape, or form.\n\n46\n00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.490\nSo, just putting that out there so\n\n47\n00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.530\nif you think of other ones it's\nnot to say that you're wrong, or\n\n48\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.770\nsay that we're kinda short changing\nthe other ones, it's just kind of make\n\n49\n00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.460\nthe conversation a lot more streamlined\nand make it easier, for all of us.\n\n50\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.700\n>> So let's start within\nfederation identity management.\n\n51\n00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.570\nThis is a Microsoft thing, if I'm correct?\n\n52\n00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.925\n>> Well, it's-\n>> Or does it go beyond,\n\n53\n00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:01.640\nwanna talk about Federated Identify-.\n\n54\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.730\nWhoo!\nI can't say that.\n\n55\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.985\n>> I have trouble with that, too, man.\n\n56\n00:03:03.985 --> 00:03:05.650\n>> Federated Identity Services.\n\n57\n00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.715\nWe'll enunciate our words today.\n\n58\n00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:09.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so,\n\n59\n00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.340\nwe're not talking about Microsoft,\nin general, but\n\n60\n00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.075\nmore of a concept of\nFederated Identity Management?\n\n61\n00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:16.030\n>> Yes, that's what it is.\n\n62\n00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.250\nI have the same problem on this.\n\n63\n00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.430\nAnd for me,\nit's not pronounced, it's like.\n\n64\n00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.247\nWhat is it?\nIs it federation or federated?\n\n65\n00:03:23.247 --> 00:03:25.699\nI get that all mixed up-\n>> It's the Federation of Planets,\n\n66\n00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.360\nwe all know what you're trying to say.\n\n67\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.435\n>> Yeah, I wanna go for\nfrom this to like this.\n\n68\n00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:32.400\n[LAUGH] So it's a subtle difference.\n\n69\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.350\nYeah, so\nI think to really make sure we're doing\n\n70\n00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.050\nthis topic justice here, at least with\nthis Federated Identity Management is,\n\n71\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.400\nreally kind of eliminate that confusion\nabout, whose it is, as well as what it is,\n\n72\n00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.120\nand before we can really get\ninto what it means to us.\n\n73\n00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.310\nSo, yeah,\n\n74\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.370\none of things you do have with Federated\nIdentity Management the concept of it is,\n\n75\n00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.615\nbecause a lot of us being in a Microsoft\nshop, that's whose products you have,\n\n76\n00:04:02.615 --> 00:04:08.140\nand if you've been upgrading over the\nyears, which we're all going to be doing.\n\n77\n00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.025\nWe start upgrading the new versions.\n\n78\n00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:13.780\nYou'd notice the last couple of releases\nor so, you'd notice something in\n\n79\n00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.380\nthe server product called, this Federated\nIdentity Services, or what have you.\n\n80\n00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.310\nIt was\nActive Directory Federated Services.\n\n81\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.550\nADFS is what they formally call it.\n\n82\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.910\nSo it's a component of, and\nworks with Active Directory, but\n\n83\n00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.220\nyou don't even have to install it.\n\n84\n00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.770\nAnd a lot of people don't,\n\n85\n00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.500\nbecause it's something that\nthey don't necessarily need.\n\n86\n00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.090\nIt's got a very unique kind of place,\nbut important place non the less, in\n\n87\n00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.790\nthe overall ecosystem we're setting up, if\nyou happen to have the right conditions.\n\n88\n00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.420\nSo when you look at Federated Identity\nManagement, so what is the real goal here?\n\n89\n00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.920\nWell, to understand the goal of Federated\nIdentity Management, let's kinda look at\n\n90\n00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.200\njust something like, again I'm making sure\nthat you understand this is not something.\n\n91\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.220\nQuit cheating David, you don't have\nto put a Wikipedia article up there.\n\n92\n00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.200\nYeah if I coulda been doing this\njob this way I would be like.\n\n93\n00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.510\nCarl, will be back in 20 minutes.\n\n94\n00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.609\n[LAUGH] But Federated Identity Management,\n\n95\n00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:15.970\nwe'll look at just the core\nissue here with authentication.\n\n96\n00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.220\nSo even though it's not a Microsoft thing,\nit's used in other areas outside of that,\n\n97\n00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.330\nwe'll just use Microsoft as an example.\n\n98\n00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.940\nIt's probably gonna get most\nof the people covered in\n\n99\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.800\nunderstanding what we're getting at.\n\n100\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.150\nWhen we look something\nlike Active Directory,\n\n101\n00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.130\nActive Directory does a lot of\nthings as a network management tool.\n\n102\n00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.145\nOne of the things it provides is\nauthentication and authorization services.\n\n103\n00:05:40.145 --> 00:05:43.565\nSo when you log into it,\nit figures out who you are and\n\n104\n00:05:43.565 --> 00:05:46.805\nthen figures out what the rules are for\nwhat you get access to.\n\n105\n00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:52.185\nOkay, and it has whole mechanism for\ndoing that, Cerberus and all that jazz.\n\n106\n00:05:53.355 --> 00:05:58.405\nAnd if you wanna get into that,\n\n107\n00:05:58.405 --> 00:06:02.210\nITProTV has plenty of\nMicrosoft courses on that.\n\n108\n00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.420\nSo, get some use out of that membership.\n\n109\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.670\nThat's all I'm trying to say.\n\n110\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.730\nSo that should be your new tag line for\nhim, you know, you said that,\n\n111\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.680\ndo the knife hands, get some use of of it.\n\n112\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.900\nSo that's been covered there, we will\nlet you go to that side if you want to\n\n113\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.570\nsee the inner workings\nof Active Directory.\n\n114\n00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.600\nSo, when you have the Active Directory\ndoing that, however,\n\n115\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.370\none of the things you do,\nis you type in your credentials and\n\n116\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.210\nit does all that stuff,\nexcluding the stuff behind the scenes for\n\n117\n00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.860\nright now, what's happening is there's\nsomething called single sign-on.\n\n118\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.552\nAnd it's one of the things\nthat's happening.\n\n119\n00:06:33.552 --> 00:06:37.570\nIt's you log in, you provide\nyour credentials, and that's it.\n\n120\n00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.340\nAnything you are authorized to\nget access to, you get access to.\n\n121\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.700\nAs long as the integrated Active Directory\nunderstands all that, then, hey,\n\n122\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.360\nyou're good.\n\n123\n00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.900\nSo you can open up,\nif you're logged in Active Directory,\n\n124\n00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.930\nyou can open up something like Outlook web\naccess, and you are authenticating against\n\n125\n00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.580\none, and you go access that,\nand you're within your network.\n\n126\n00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.230\nUnless someone's configured otherwise,\n\n127\n00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.490\nit's just gonna let you in,\ncuz it knows who you are.\n\n128\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.320\nBut if you're outside it, you're not\nauthenticating against Active Directory,\n\n129\n00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.280\nthat's gonna have to get some\ninformation to authenticate you.\n\n130\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.350\nBut single sign on says,\nI know who you are,\n\n131\n00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.600\nyou don't need to re-provide that to me,\nI've got that information.\n\n132\n00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.370\nOkay, so, that's all well and good but,\nwhen you start getting to really,\n\n133\n00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.390\nreally complex, and\n\n134\n00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.040\nI would even say legacy type systems,\nthat becomes a little more challenging.\n\n135\n00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.395\nYou can't just type your credentials\nin in somebody's systems and\n\n136\n00:07:28.395 --> 00:07:32.900\nimmediately assume that magically you're\ngonna get access to everything because,\n\n137\n00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.080\nthe systems don't talk.\n\n138\n00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.230\nThey don't share authentication systems.\n\n139\n00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.050\nNow fortunately if we\nlook at Active Directory,\n\n140\n00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.200\nActive Directory being Cerberus enabled.\n\n141\n00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.610\nCerberus V five.\n\n142\n00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.996\nThat we now have other systems out there,\nyou have Unix realms,\n\n143\n00:07:45.996 --> 00:07:49.395\nor Cerberus realms which are based\non Unix, or stuff like that.\n\n144\n00:07:49.395 --> 00:07:53.142\nTypically, those things, because you\nuse the same protocol, have a certain\n\n145\n00:07:53.142 --> 00:07:56.740\ndegree of stuff they can share to\nunderstand one another, which is great.\n\n146\n00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.722\nBut if you don't have or\naren't blessed with that luxury, and\n\n147\n00:08:01.722 --> 00:08:05.400\nI'm being kind of a wise\nguy when I say luxury.\n\n148\n00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.401\nLike it's like oh well it hosts\ncurbers too, well that's easy.\n\n149\n00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:10.660\nNo, no, you still gotta work.\n\n150\n00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.085\nSo federate identity management\nis gonna deal with another level\n\n151\n00:08:14.085 --> 00:08:15.526\noutside of that with that.\n\n152\n00:08:15.526 --> 00:08:19.842\nWhat it's gonna deal with is if you have,\nyou've implemented active directory but\n\n153\n00:08:19.842 --> 00:08:23.551\nnow you have some other applications and\nservices out there that aren't\n\n154\n00:08:23.551 --> 00:08:26.468\nembedded in any way shape or\nform with active directory,\n\n155\n00:08:26.468 --> 00:08:30.391\nyou can't do single sign on, but you\nwant to be able to talk to those things.\n\n156\n00:08:30.391 --> 00:08:34.400\nYou want to be able to long in here and\nbe able to get access to stuff over there.\n\n157\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.840\nWell, they don't understand this.\n\n158\n00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.420\nWithout doing something,\nthey don't understand this.\n\n159\n00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.550\nWell, what Federate Energy Management\ndoes is act as a glue to\n\n160\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.250\nessentially glue all of\nthose services together.\n\n161\n00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.640\nThat's really,\nwhen I think of it being glue and\n\n162\n00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.780\nI put it in that term, I think it's\na pretty good analogy to do it.\n\n163\n00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.320\nOf course a little bias,\n\n164\n00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.770\nI think it's pretty good-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n165\n00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.940\n>> I don't know why you don't see this.\n\n166\n00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.217\nThe thing is, you go and log in to an\nactive directory and it authenticates you.\n\n167\n00:09:03.217 --> 00:09:07.124\nAnd use federate and entity management\nto create these linkages between there,\n\n168\n00:09:07.124 --> 00:09:09.651\nthese claims and trusts and\nall to set that up, it can\n\n169\n00:09:09.651 --> 00:09:13.788\nexchange the authentication information,\nand those guys can now understand you and\n\n170\n00:09:13.788 --> 00:09:16.170\nunderstand the language\nthat you’re talking.\n\n171\n00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.510\nAnd then it’s just a matter of making\nsure you’re getting access to the right\n\n172\n00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.690\nthings over there.\n\n173\n00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.430\nAnd so it’s great.\n\n174\n00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:25.570\nSo if you’re an organization that doesn’t\nwanna set up active directory over here.\n\n175\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.310\nAnd you have a bunch of stuff\nsitting over there to replacing.\n\n176\n00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.780\nIf you don't wanna take that stuff and\nshove it inside an active directory.\n\n177\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.560\nCuz, they used to actually recommend that.\n\n178\n00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.090\nRemember, it was like oh,\n\n179\n00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.480\njust migrate off your current\nplatforms into a Windows platform.\n\n180\n00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.760\nOh yeah, sure, no problem.\n\n181\n00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.960\nI'll get right on that.\n\n182\n00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.500\nThat sounds really easy and\na pleasant thing to do.\n\n183\n00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.840\nI'll come in this weekend and\ndo it, bring kids.\n\n184\n00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.690\nIt wasn't that easy.\n\n185\n00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.000\nAnd it wasn't just feasible to do.\n\n186\n00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.130\nWhat if your organization\nhas been around for a while?\n\n187\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:00.050\nSomeone developed this on a UNIX\nplatform or a Linux platform.\n\n188\n00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.400\nThe technologies for\nthat all exist over there.\n\n189\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.540\nThere's no direct analog on\nthe Windows side of the house.\n\n190\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.200\nYou are in a situation where it\nstays there and you deal with it, or\n\n191\n00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.540\nyou find another way to integrate it.\n\n192\n00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.160\nBecause you will not be moving that\nover here in any way, shape, or form.\n\n193\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.810\nVirtualization, you can bring it over,\nbut it’s still not talking.\n\n194\n00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.690\nYou just brought it from there and\nstuck it in a sandbox over here.\n\n195\n00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.870\nYou gotta get that\nlinkage between the two.\n\n196\n00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.110\nSo federated identity management\nprovides that so you can have all these\n\n197\n00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.130\nother services and applications\nwhere you're talking back and forth.\n\n198\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:34.940\nAnd it's a pretty nice thing when\nit's set up the right way and\n\n199\n00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.400\nyou're taking full advantage of it.\n\n200\n00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.240\nIf you're someone like,\n\n201\n00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.140\nI know a large financial services\ncompany that, they've been around for so\n\n202\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.500\nlong that they were in that exact same\nboat that I was just talking about.\n\n203\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.570\nThey have a lot of custom applications.\n\n204\n00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.410\nYou can think most companies have a lot\nif they've been around long enough.\n\n205\n00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:58.010\nThey developed a lot of things that hey\nwe got that we just can't get rid of it.\n\n206\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.050\nWe can't replace it.\n\n207\n00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.760\nI heard that a lot.\n\n208\n00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.690\nI'm sure you heard that too.\n\n209\n00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:05.310\nThey got something that they\njust can't get away from.\n\n210\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.670\n>> The concept of single\nsign on is just fantastic.\n\n211\n00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:13.010\nWe worry about our users making strong\npasswords, we worry about them having to\n\n212\n00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.750\nchange them frequently,\nwriting them down, sharing them.\n\n213\n00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.070\nAnd as soon as I say you've got\nto have one type of login for\n\n214\n00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.440\nwork but you're going to have\na different account that when you\n\n215\n00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.702\nconnect to one of our business partners\nand access their web application,\n\n216\n00:11:25.702 --> 00:11:31.340\nit's a separate account when you go up\nto Office 365, and you log in there.\n\n217\n00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.710\nNow that's three separate accounts,\nthree passwords, and\n\n218\n00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.510\nyou can just multiply that and\njust increases the problems.\n\n219\n00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.620\nAnd the big problem is I can get\nauthenticated within my network, but\n\n220\n00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.470\nonly devices and other computers within\nmy network trust authentication, right?\n\n221\n00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.350\nThe fact that it verified my password.\n\n222\n00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:50.395\nI go to that business partner's website\nand try to present my authentication so\n\n223\n00:11:50.395 --> 00:11:54.035\nhey, look I've already logged in, so\nsays well who verified your credentials.\n\n224\n00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:58.265\nI don't know who domain controller one is,\nso that federation says,\n\n225\n00:11:58.265 --> 00:12:03.350\nI want to extend the trust of my\nauthentication process beyond my boundary.\n\n226\n00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:08.040\nAnd it allows me to have one account\nthat I can use across multiple services.\n\n227\n00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.160\nBecause they're all, as you said,\n\n228\n00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.770\nthey're all gonna now trust\nthat authentication process.\n\n229\n00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:16.330\nSo you're basically, kinda like you said,\nyou're linking those credentials and\n\n230\n00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.090\nthose attributes that go with it.\n\n231\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.050\nAnd so now I can take my account,\nand I can access that web\n\n232\n00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.480\napplication from some other organization,\nand they can read my access token and\n\n233\n00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.190\nthey can see that I'm in the manager's\ndepartment and they can give\n\n234\n00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.450\nme a different level of access on that\nweb application because I'm a manager.\n\n235\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.090\nEven though their servers are not the one\nthat authenticated me, rather than having\n\n236\n00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.550\nto have all these independent\nseparate Authentication processes.\n\n237\n00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.110\nSo it is something that\nwe're gonna see more and\n\n238\n00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.590\nmore of, especially with the cloud and\nall of this.\n\n239\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.540\nAnd having to access these services and\nthese applications.\n\n240\n00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.723\nWhen we're outside our environment and\n\n241\n00:12:51.723 --> 00:12:55.135\nnot want to expose active directory\ndirectly to the internet.\n\n242\n00:12:55.135 --> 00:13:00.047\n>> Yeah, it's a big deal to have\nsomething like this and it's going to\n\n243\n00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:05.540\ngrow in usage and you can just see\nit getting ready to grow in usage.\n\n244\n00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.450\nBecause of the convenience and\npower of it.\n\n245\n00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.160\nAnd let's also make something clear here\non this is that it's not just, you know,\n\n246\n00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.672\nusing active directory as an example,\nbecause it's one that we understand and\n\n247\n00:13:16.672 --> 00:13:20.881\nI'm saying it's active directory to\nsomething, to like legacy stuff.\n\n248\n00:13:20.881 --> 00:13:25.556\nIt doesn't necessarily have to be\nthat way, I mean if you look at,\n\n249\n00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:29.226\nI wanna say off the top of my head and\nif I'm doing it,\n\n250\n00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:34.234\nif I'm saying this wrong someone can\nstop me on it and I'll ignore you,\n\n251\n00:13:34.234 --> 00:13:38.770\non the Microsoft side,\nthey can host Active Directory for you.\n\n252\n00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:39.810\nSo you don't hae to that or\n\n253\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.300\ndo Active Directory yourself if that's\nsomething that is beyond your skill to do\n\n254\n00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.800\nall the care and feeding of or you just\nwant to offload it to someone else so\n\n255\n00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.340\nyou don't necessarily worry about\nall the little details of it.\n\n256\n00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.920\nIf that's the case, so you hand\nthe active directory over to them and\n\n257\n00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.250\nyou're gonna use that as\na way to manage your stuff.\n\n258\n00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.270\nThe way you can do that is\nthat you pay them to host it.\n\n259\n00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.826\nAnd then what you do is you set\nup essentially a baby active\n\n260\n00:14:03.826 --> 00:14:06.649\ndirectory deployment on yours that\ndoes a little bit on site and\n\n261\n00:14:06.649 --> 00:14:09.167\nusing federation services\nto glue those two together.\n\n262\n00:14:09.167 --> 00:14:12.647\nSo they got theirs and you got yours,\nthey're hosting this for you so\n\n263\n00:14:12.647 --> 00:14:16.307\nFederation Services closes that gap\nbetween the two, so you're seeing\n\n264\n00:14:16.307 --> 00:14:20.567\nsomething that's basically for all intents\nand purposes, you want to look at it and\n\n265\n00:14:20.567 --> 00:14:24.690\nsay okay that should be a homogenous\nsolution everything's all together.\n\n266\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.920\nBut no, it's still treated as two\ndifferent things, two different\n\n267\n00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.130\nsections in here, so we're just tying the\ntwo together using Federation Services.\n\n268\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.830\n>> Absolutely, yeah,\nMicrosoft will let you, in their cloud,\n\n269\n00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.920\nthey provide Federation Services,\nif you wanna use that.\n\n270\n00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.570\nAnd what's great about setting\nup Federation Services\n\n271\n00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:44.390\nis not a simple task by any means.\n\n272\n00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.300\nBoth ends have to run a federated service,\nor\n\n273\n00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.040\nservery if you're in the Microsoft world.\n\n274\n00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.070\nSame for other products.\n\n275\n00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.550\nBoth ends have to be running this,\nyou have to set up rules that say\n\n276\n00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.390\ni'm going to trust that authentication\nthat's coming in from that other company.\n\n277\n00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:59.860\nYou've got to set up how you want to\nprocess those, set up an agreement.\n\n278\n00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.620\nThey have their inbound and\noutbound trust you have to create.\n\n279\n00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:05.290\nWith Microsoft and the Cloud,\nthey have your information,\n\n280\n00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.750\nthey have this other\ncompany's information.\n\n281\n00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.470\nThey'll host the federation server for\nyou.\n\n282\n00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.232\nAnd it's pretty darn seamless.\n\n283\n00:15:10.232 --> 00:15:14.522\nBut it's probably something that we're\ngonna see more and more of, I think,\n\n284\n00:15:14.522 --> 00:15:18.552\nas we move along because we need to be\nauthenticated when we're not inside\n\n285\n00:15:18.552 --> 00:15:21.412\nthe organization,\nwhether that's coming back and\n\n286\n00:15:21.412 --> 00:15:25.507\naccessing my own company''s resources\nfrom outside web applications or\n\n287\n00:15:25.507 --> 00:15:29.538\ninternal resources, or whether I'm\nconnecting to a business partner.\n\n288\n00:15:29.538 --> 00:15:31.017\nI have to be authenticated and\n\n289\n00:15:31.017 --> 00:15:34.508\nthat signal sign on just makes life\na whole lot easier, you guys know,\n\n290\n00:15:34.508 --> 00:15:38.195\nI mean how many different accounts do\nyou have for all the stuff out there.\n\n291\n00:15:38.195 --> 00:15:42.174\nJust think about your work accounts\nthat you might have, and you start\n\n292\n00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:46.424\nto see the benefit of that single sign-on,\nsomething we've had in most,\n\n293\n00:15:46.424 --> 00:15:50.944\nall your Linux realms, those Unix realms,\nthey all support single sign-on,\n\n294\n00:15:50.944 --> 00:15:55.532\nMicrosoft obviously supports single\nsign-on, now we're just extending that\n\n295\n00:15:55.532 --> 00:15:59.326\noutside, and Connecting into\nother companies' single sign on.\n\n296\n00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:00.649\nSo it's really a pretty cool thing.\n\n297\n00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:05.623\n>> I think, just to kind of, since you\njust made the mention of were talking\n\n298\n00:16:05.623 --> 00:16:09.946\nabout single SSO here,\nMikayla makes this comment down here,\n\n299\n00:16:09.946 --> 00:16:15.929\nshe says she thinks SSO is great, but also\nthinks it's contrary to defense and depth.\n\n300\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:22.150\nYeah, you're not the only\none to think that.\n\n301\n00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:26.090\nI would look at it and\nthink the exact same thing.\n\n302\n00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:30.450\nAnd from one standpoint,\nit would be like saying that,\n\n303\n00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.840\nif you had one key that opens up\na whole building and, that's it.\n\n304\n00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.260\nThat's convenient for you,\noh you only have to carry one key, right?\n\n305\n00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.630\nYou only have to remember to\nkeep that one thing with you.\n\n306\n00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.440\nBut from a security standpoint,\nwell that's horrible.\n\n307\n00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.860\nYou have one key that opens up everything.\n\n308\n00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.950\nAll somebody has to do is grab that one\nthing, they got access to everything.\n\n309\n00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.950\nSo SSO is kinda, sorta the same thing.\n\n310\n00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:54.550\nNow, one of the things,\nat least we have in the Active Directory,\n\n311\n00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:59.140\nin other SSO technologies that we don't\nhave in the physical thing with the key is\n\n312\n00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.470\nthat, I can still say, not everyone\nis going to have the same key.\n\n313\n00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.770\nYou get to access everything you\nwould have access to by logging in.\n\n314\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.160\nBut that doesn't mean\nit's the whole building.\n\n315\n00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.220\nIt means there's only selected things\nyou get access to, within that location.\n\n316\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.820\n>> Yeah,\nI would definitely agree with you.\n\n317\n00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.080\nI would compare it to RFID\nthat carry around with me.\n\n318\n00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.640\nYeah, it's easy, it's great.\n\n319\n00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.720\nI've got one RFID thing I can use.\n\n320\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.720\nAnd you might think, well, wait.\n\n321\n00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.540\nThat's not defense in depth.\n\n322\n00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.257\nBut the cool thing is,\nis we've moved the security part of it,\n\n323\n00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.025\nback to the management side.\n\n324\n00:17:31.025 --> 00:17:33.606\nSomebody else can decide what\ndoors I can get through, and\n\n325\n00:17:33.606 --> 00:17:35.088\nwhat doors I can't get through.\n\n326\n00:17:35.088 --> 00:17:39.730\nThe RFID is just the key, but\nit's programmable from somewhere else.\n\n327\n00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.450\nAnd it's the same thing\nwith single sign-on.\n\n328\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.800\nMaybe, yes, I could say where it\nseems like having one user name and\n\n329\n00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.880\npassword for everything is\na vulnerability, but it's the fact that I\n\n330\n00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.160\ncan control that access now within\nthe network, outside of the network.\n\n331\n00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.410\nAnd also understand that we're not saying\nthat the single sign is going to carry\n\n332\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.140\nover to your Hotmail account, or\nto your personal bank account or\n\n333\n00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:01.760\nanything like that.\n\n334\n00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.850\nIt's still your work account, so it's much\neasier to manage one work account for\n\n335\n00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.830\nall the things you need to do,\nwhether it's internal or\n\n336\n00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.930\nexternal, with the business partner,\nthan to have multiple accounts to manage.\n\n337\n00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.760\nI think that's where the big\nbenefit is for the single sign-on.\n\n338\n00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.774\nYeah, and if you're really kinda\nwanna boil it down to the most basic\n\n339\n00:18:19.774 --> 00:18:25.134\nquestion here, which Makayla,\nyou're in that thought process there,\n\n340\n00:18:25.134 --> 00:18:30.560\nis it's one that we that we've\nsaid all along with security.\n\n341\n00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.350\nSingle sign on, it's great, but\nno matter which way you slice it,\n\n342\n00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.790\nit does have some impact on security,\nby lessening it to a certain degree.\n\n343\n00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.620\nBut you have to balance it out\nwith the convenience aspect too.\n\n344\n00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.690\nWhich one is gonna be better.\n\n345\n00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:50.250\nI could very easily say that this\nSSO flies counter defense in depth.\n\n346\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.270\nWe could sit here and very easily\nmake a case for it, no problem.\n\n347\n00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:56.690\nBut, let's spin this just a bit and\nlook at it from a different angle.\n\n348\n00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.640\nIs it better to do SSO\nwhere you log in and\n\n349\n00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.130\nyou have access to everything someone\nelse has given you access to?\n\n350\n00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.350\nOr is it better to have,\na dozen different or\n\n351\n00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.010\nmore passwords and\nhave someone have to remembers those,\n\n352\n00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.460\ncuz you know what's happening-\n>> And\n\n353\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.560\na large Help Desk to be expecting phone\ncalls all the time to reset passwords.\n\n354\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.200\nWhat password did I use here?\n\n355\n00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.870\n>> There's that, and there's also\nthe dreaded thing where they start\n\n356\n00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.190\nwriting the stuff down all over the place.\n\n357\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.490\nAnd they're not taking control of it.\n\n358\n00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.440\nAnd I've heard people tell\nme well password managers,\n\n359\n00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.290\njust use a password manager.\n\n360\n00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.400\nI'm not really too hot on\npassword managers myself.\n\n361\n00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.460\nI'm not as far to be you know like,\nreally,\n\n362\n00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:39.110\nreally aggressively opposed to 'em,\nbut I can't help but laugh\n\n363\n00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:43.690\nwhen I saw someone posted on a discussion\ngroup not too long ago, it was literally.\n\n364\n00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:47.540\nI think since the last time I was here,\nso just about a month ago,\n\n365\n00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.700\nwhen I left last time.\n\n366\n00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.450\nI saw someone posting someplace,\ngoing oh, just use a password manager,\n\n367\n00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.510\nit's the most secure way to\nhandle your passwords, bar none.\n\n368\n00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:57.075\nThey made a big, big deal about it.\n\n369\n00:19:57.075 --> 00:19:59.414\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I could have been a real,\n\n370\n00:19:59.414 --> 00:20:03.058\nreal jerk about the whole thing and\nposted an article from about three,\n\n371\n00:20:03.058 --> 00:20:06.762\nfour months ago that said that whole\nservice that stored these things for\n\n372\n00:20:06.762 --> 00:20:09.454\nyou had been compromised,\nand they stole them all.\n\n373\n00:20:09.454 --> 00:20:12.042\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so this person's going,\n\n374\n00:20:12.042 --> 00:20:14.100\nI'd store all my stuff in there.\n\n375\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.510\nIt's like I should have kept them from\n\n376\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.780\nlooking a little bad there by grabbing\nhis password, logging in as him and\n\n377\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.655\nchanging it, and then saying,\nno, I fixed that for you.\n\n378\n00:20:22.655 --> 00:20:23.730\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n379\n00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.760\nAll right, so\nfederation identity management,\n\n380\n00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.890\nnot the only advance authentication\nwe want to talk about.\n\n381\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.100\nWe also want to get into\ncertificate services,\n\n382\n00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.270\nor certificate based authentication.\n\n383\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.390\n>> I wanna mention one other\nthing before we do that.\n\n384\n00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.920\nCuz I think it is important,\n\n385\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.740\nbecause you did touch upon it when you\nwere talking here, as what you said, yeah,\n\n386\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.920\nit's not easy to set up, to set up\nfederated services across anything.\n\n387\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.340\nAnd just to kinda give you\nanother solution here,\n\n388\n00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.480\nby the way, RSA does offer their own\nfederated services technology too.\n\n389\n00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.240\nSo other than Microsoft, there's that.\n\n390\n00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.430\nSo, okay, but the thing on that is,\n\n391\n00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:04.100\nis that you don't just set this\nup as easily as Active Directory.\n\n392\n00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.350\nThey do call\nActive Directory Federated Services, and\n\n393\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.300\nwe're talking all this\nnice stuff about it.\n\n394\n00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:13.190\nIt delivers on all of those, but to set it\nup, it does take a considerable amount of\n\n395\n00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.870\neffort and patience, and really get to\nknow the intimate details of things.\n\n396\n00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:21.000\nYou're gonna have to know things like\nthe Cert protocol, XML, stuff life that.\n\n397\n00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.370\nThey even have stuff with the Security\nAssociation Markup Language, SAML,\n\n398\n00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:28.340\nas they call it,\nwhich is a variation Of a XML,\n\n399\n00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.620\nsame zip code as I like to say,\nbut you will have to learn it.\n\n400\n00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.080\nFortunately, after you've learned that and\nset it up,\n\n401\n00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:40.060\nit should be a point where you just\ndo tweaks to those now and then.\n\n402\n00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:45.340\nThe initial getting over that hump into\nfrom theory into actual practical design\n\n403\n00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:50.240\nand usage, is gonna be something\nthat's gonna be uphill in a big,\n\n404\n00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.690\njust not a speed bump,\n\n405\n00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:57.430\nit's gonna be a bump in the road, but\nit does take some time, but you can do it.\n\n406\n00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.910\n>> A certificate authentication\nis easy to set up.\n\n407\n00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.290\nIt doesn't take anything at all.\n\n408\n00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.160\n>> Yeah that was-\n>> [LAUGH] Just kidding.\n\n409\n00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.490\nIt's another one of our advanced\nauthentication methods, and again,\n\n410\n00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:12.660\nlike federated, it brings another\nlevel of security to the game,\n\n411\n00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.140\nversus just say, using names and\npasswords or other authentication methods.\n\n412\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:20.830\nAlso brings a bit of,\nI wanna say portability,\n\n413\n00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.120\nkinda, again,\nit's gonna be based on trust, right?\n\n414\n00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.130\n>> Yeah, and\nI think you hit it on the head there.\n\n415\n00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.750\nIt does actually bring a degree of\nportability because certificates,\n\n416\n00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.690\nas long as they're adhering to the\nstandards that we have for certificates,\n\n417\n00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.160\nand remember, there is a standard for it.\n\n418\n00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:41.730\nWhen we look at everyone using\nthose standards, yeah, you can be\n\n419\n00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:45.750\na cross-platform or a cross-technology,\nand you adhere to that standard,\n\n420\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.740\nyou could present their certificate,\nand they can authenticate you.\n\n421\n00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.430\nProvided that there's a common trust\nbetween you and the other party, that they\n\n422\n00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.620\nboth trust the same CA, either directly or\nindirectly through a chain of trust.\n\n423\n00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:03.460\nThat they can say, okay, we can find some\nway to say okay, we trust this, and this,\n\n424\n00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:08.240\nand this, and since there's a connection\nbetween the two, we'll go ahead and\n\n425\n00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.310\nsay, you can talk to this person and\nvice versa.\n\n426\n00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.820\nIt's great.\n\n427\n00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:17.920\nThat's why they're using stuff like\nVPNs and e-commerce and all that,\n\n428\n00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.730\nbecause clearly, if you're doing\nbusiness with someone like Amazon or\n\n429\n00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:27.740\nPayPal, or what have you, unless you\nwork for those guys directly, you're\n\n430\n00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.400\nnot in the same organization, you're\nsomeone else getting something from them.\n\n431\n00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.430\nSo, what happens is when you go to them,\nthere's a certificate actually\n\n432\n00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:41.260\npresented and checked and all that, and\nverified, before that association's made.\n\n433\n00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.297\nSo they do provide a very,\nvery strong way of authenticating and\n\n434\n00:23:45.297 --> 00:23:48.155\nmaking stuff happen across organizations.\n\n435\n00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:53.199\nThe cool thing about certificate service\nis and that whole deal that goes\n\n436\n00:23:53.199 --> 00:23:58.157\nwith it is it's you know, I think of\nit like working with LEGOs or clay or\n\n437\n00:23:58.157 --> 00:24:03.615\nsomething like that, because it's\nsomething that you can mold, and build so\n\n438\n00:24:03.615 --> 00:24:09.220\nmany different ways, and provide so\nmany strong solutions to it, or with it.\n\n439\n00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.620\nAnd it can integrate with so many things.\n\n440\n00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.780\nWhen you look at certificates,\n\n441\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.470\nwe're talking about it in the sense that,\nof just the authentication part of it,\n\n442\n00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.320\nwhich is really part of the whole\nthing across the board.\n\n443\n00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.780\nBut how you use that authentication\nisn't the end all do all of it,\n\n444\n00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.810\nyou're authenticating for a reason,\nwhich is to do something else.\n\n445\n00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:32.260\nAnd so, certificates are used with so many\ndifferent technologies, they're used, yes,\n\n446\n00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.990\nthey're used to do plain authentication,\nand to give you authorization and\n\n447\n00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:36.107\nthen encryption and all that.\n\n448\n00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:39.930\nBut they're used for digital signatures\nand all other sorts of things.\n\n449\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:43.420\nSo you may already be\naware of that in your job.\n\n450\n00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:48.120\nYou get issued in different companies and\n\n451\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.620\nthe government uses these\nthings in several places.\n\n452\n00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.130\nAround the world I've seen them.\n\n453\n00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.020\nThe smart cards with the chip\nin it that they can actually\n\n454\n00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.000\nstore certificates in that.\n\n455\n00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.880\nSo, you plug in someplace and\nthe card into the reader,\n\n456\n00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.990\nit will be able to check out and\nknows how to check it out to see through\n\n457\n00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:08.380\nthe operating system check to see if\nthat's a valid certificate or credential.\n\n458\n00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.543\nAnd then it will let you\nproceed with everything.\n\n459\n00:25:10.543 --> 00:25:14.470\nAnd they're used for authentication and\nall that, on that same card.\n\n460\n00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:18.245\nSo it's huge, and you use certificates\nliterally all the time and\n\n461\n00:25:18.245 --> 00:25:19.640\nyou don't even think about it.\n\n462\n00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.760\nThat's the thing,\nis that you don't think about it.\n\n463\n00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.810\nWith all the stuff you do with just\nconnecting to protected services on\n\n464\n00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:30.310\nthe Internet, to downloading drivers,\nto doing what have you.\n\n465\n00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.040\nCertificates are a vital part of that.\n\n466\n00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.170\n>> Yeah, they are, you see it more and\nmore, as Smart Card technology\n\n467\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:41.340\nbecomes less expensive, and it's\nimplemented, more in these enterprises.\n\n468\n00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.070\nWe're seeing a lot more of it, and\n\n469\n00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.700\nthat just means we've got to be ready\nto implement it, support it, and\n\n470\n00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.360\nunderstand the strengths and the\nweaknesses that are associated with it.\n\n471\n00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.260\nThat's a lot of good information\nthere on advanced authentication,\n\n472\n00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.950\nanything else we need to talk about,\nSean, on this one?\n\n473\n00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:03.230\n>> Well, just to throw in here at the end,\nthe quick disclaimer speech on this.\n\n474\n00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.840\nWe're well aware these are not\nall the advanced authentication\n\n475\n00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.060\ntechniques you can use.\n\n476\n00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:14.550\nYou can really pick up other stuff\nin here too, if you want to.\n\n477\n00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:18.680\nReally start doing other advanced\nauthentication things that fit into here,\n\n478\n00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.510\nbut they also kind of cross over into the\nregular authentication as well if we can\n\n479\n00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:23.540\ncall it that.\n\n480\n00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.600\nIs biometrics can plug into this,\n\n481\n00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.740\nthere's location services\nthat can do authentication.\n\n482\n00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.823\nThere is a bunch of other things\nthat are becoming more and\n\n483\n00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:36.204\nmore of a vital part of this, and then\neven working into these other techniques.\n\n484\n00:26:36.204 --> 00:26:40.159\nSo I still kind of myself throw biometrics\ninto more of an advanced authentication\n\n485\n00:26:40.159 --> 00:26:44.347\ntechnique, because while they're getting\neasier to implement, they're becoming\n\n486\n00:26:44.347 --> 00:26:48.490\nmore commonplace, it is typically\nsomething you associate with those levels.\n\n487\n00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:52.350\nThe biometric authentication we get in\nthe form of fingerprint readers and\n\n488\n00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:56.230\nstuff like that,\non laptops is a common place to see them.\n\n489\n00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.240\nThey're kinda still at the toy stage for\nthe stuff they do for\n\n490\n00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.100\nmost vendors, because the really\ngood ones are really expensive and\n\n491\n00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.300\nhave a bunch of features on them, and\na high degree of accuracy on them.\n\n492\n00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.500\nSo you don't see those.\n\n493\n00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.390\nThose require just more to do.\n\n494\n00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:17.350\nSo, that's just to kind of open up\na little of that and give you a peek.\n\n495\n00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.430\nYeah, I do understand there's other\nauthentication techniques like\n\n496\n00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:23.340\nthe biometrics stuff like that if\nyou want to take it down that road.\n\n497\n00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.210\n>> All right, well very good Sean,\nappreciate all the information.\n\n498\n00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:27.960\nBut that's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n499\n00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.410\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n500\n00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:31.360\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n501\n00:27:31.360 -->

00:00:17.300\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today, is the famous Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.220\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.990\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.550\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.290\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.191\nWe got another exciting episode\ncoming your way in our in\n\n9\n00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:25.080\nCompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner\nseries.\n\n10\n00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.857\nThis one Sean, we're gonna take a look at,\nwhat do we got,\n\n11\n00:00:28.857 --> 00:00:33.791\nsecure life cycles, or securing our\ntechnology through their life cycles.\n\n12\n00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:35.453\n>> Yeah, that's really it.\n\n13\n00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:38.968\nWe call it secure life cycle because\nthere's a lot of things included into it,\n\n14\n00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:42.290\nbut really we're talking\nabout the technology itself.\n\n15\n00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.390\nBecause we talked about\nall this technology\n\n16\n00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.070\nin the context of our organization, and\nwhat it means and all that good stuff.\n\n17\n00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.120\nBut what we're kind of overlooking is,\nthe process of acquiring,\n\n18\n00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.670\nmanaging, decommissioning, and eventually\njust plain old getting rid of it.\n\n19\n00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.300\nThat's all part of this.\n\n20\n00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.860\nYou just don't have technology.\n\n21\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.390\nIt just doesn't appear,\nthen all of the sudden it's gone.\n\n22\n00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.242\nThere's things that happen prior to\nacquisition, during acquisition.\n\n23\n00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:15.408\nAnd then after that when you're\njust running it through company,\n\n24\n00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.339\nit may change roles, and so on so forth.\n\n25\n00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:21.526\nAnd then it gets old enough\nwhere at some point or broken or\n\n26\n00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:25.360\nwhatever, that it has\nto be decommissioned.\n\n27\n00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.630\nAnd then after it's decommissioned, it\ncould actually be that it's disposed of,\n\n28\n00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.120\nor it may be going someplace else.\n\n29\n00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.370\nA lot of things potentially happen\nhere and they are absolutely,\n\n30\n00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.210\npositively something that is gonna impact\nthe security stance of your corporation,\n\n31\n00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.682\nor company, whatever it is.\n\n32\n00:01:42.682 --> 00:01:45.910\n>> Yeah, cuz all these things\nthat we're talking about\n\n33\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.920\ncould potentially have data on them,\nis that where the big impact is?\n\n34\n00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.670\nBecause, phones,\nthumb drives, hard drives,\n\n35\n00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.880\nlaptops, I'm trying to think of what else.\n\n36\n00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.290\nFlash cards, flash media,\nthings like that,\n\n37\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.350\nthe problem is it all has information\non it, and how do we get rid of that?\n\n38\n00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.120\n>> Yeah, that's a huge,\nhuge part of it, it is the data.\n\n39\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.650\nIf we look at one of\nthe really common ones,\n\n40\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.388\nyou look at just the plain,\nsimple desktop system that you have,\n\n41\n00:02:14.388 --> 00:02:20.040\npopulating the desktops and cubicles and\nwhat have you of any organization.\n\n42\n00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.645\nYou've got some serious concerns there.\n\n43\n00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:28.510\nWhen we look at the life cycle,\n\n44\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.180\nit is actually, when you figure\nout what type of systems you need.\n\n45\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.020\nSo you've specked stuff out.\n\n46\n00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.245\nYou figured out what you need to really\nmeet the needs of now and down the line.\n\n47\n00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:40.525\nAnd we're used to saying, well,\n\n48\n00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:42.876\nwe've got something that's got\nsome growth potential in it.\n\n49\n00:02:42.876 --> 00:02:46.072\nBut we also have to consider\nfrom a security standpoint,\n\n50\n00:02:46.072 --> 00:02:50.533\nis it gonna be able to, as the way we see\nit, be able to handle new technologies we\n\n51\n00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:55.025\nmay have planned down the road that\nwe know are emerging and are close.\n\n52\n00:02:55.025 --> 00:03:01.155\nOr are they capable of maybe having\ncustomization or anything done to them.\n\n53\n00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:05.750\nSo why they don't support, we don't know\nwhat technology's coming down the road.\n\n54\n00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.285\nIt supports open standards,\nthat we can say okay, well,\n\n55\n00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:10.217\nit's not something that's proprietary.\n\n56\n00:03:10.217 --> 00:03:14.329\nSo it can plug into something else\nthat we can't potentially foresee,\n\n57\n00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.680\nas long as it is something\nthat plays by those standards.\n\n58\n00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.300\nAnd the standards should be something\nthat's globally accepted, or\n\n59\n00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.210\nwidely accepted at the very least,\nthat makes it so you can do that.\n\n60\n00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.110\nSo you have that,\n\n61\n00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.920\nthen you get the acquisition once you've\nmade that decision and settled on it.\n\n62\n00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.218\nYou have acquisition process, which is\nprobably one of the bigger parts of that,\n\n63\n00:03:34.218 --> 00:03:37.034\nI'd say is that when you get\nto the acquisition part.\n\n64\n00:03:37.034 --> 00:03:39.713\nBecause when you actually\npurchase a system,\n\n65\n00:03:39.713 --> 00:03:42.540\nthere's different\nstrategies companies use.\n\n66\n00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.030\nThere's companies that will just\npurchase the asset outright, and\n\n67\n00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.810\nthat way it's theirs forever and ever.\n\n68\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.385\nThen there's the other one,\n\n69\n00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:54.480\nwhich is also just as common to see them\nleasing that stuff from someone else.\n\n70\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.711\nAnd then they'll just when it's done, they\nwill give it back to whatever the company\n\n71\n00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:02.960\nis, and get new stuff or what have you,\nbut that company is responsible.\n\n72\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.580\nThe leasing company owns that equipment,\nfor all intents and purpose.\n\n73\n00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.710\nSo you'll see that sort\nof strategy adopted, and\n\n74\n00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.815\nthat can impact you to a certain degree,\n\n75\n00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:21.340\ncuz through the life cycle\nwho really owns the asset.\n\n76\n00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.583\nWhat happens when I have\nto do repairs on it?\n\n77\n00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:28.226\nThat's gonna be another concern, and\n\n78\n00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:31.030\nthen there's even top of that what\nhappens when you dispose of it.\n\n79\n00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.465\nSo we've got all that happening.\n\n80\n00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:39.040\nSo you acquire it, and what have you from\nwherever, so just take the overview of it.\n\n81\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.320\nSo you acquire it.\n\n82\n00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.170\nOnce you'll acquire it,\nyou got the management portion of it.\n\n83\n00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.470\nIt's not uncommon to have to make that\ndecision at that point, whether or\n\n84\n00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.130\nnot you're gonna get a bare metal system,\nor\n\n85\n00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.040\nyou gonna get a system\nwith stuff already on it.\n\n86\n00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.540\nAnd what you may do after you get it,\nimmediately after you acquire the system.\n\n87\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.580\nOne of the things that you'll\nsee in some situations,\n\n88\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.308\nis when they get the system\nfrom a vendor or from a lease\n\n89\n00:05:03.308 --> 00:05:09.130\ncompany, they may say, well we have to\nimage it immediately when we get in here.\n\n90\n00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.973\nAnd one of the things I used to see,\nand I still do see,\n\n91\n00:05:12.973 --> 00:05:16.990\nin pockets here and there,\nis we see situations where,\n\n92\n00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.456\nI go at the leasing company or\nwhatever the outside vendor is.\n\n93\n00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:26.423\nAnd if I'm a big enough company, I can say\nwell, I've got a contract with you and\n\n94\n00:05:26.423 --> 00:05:27.457\nall that set up.\n\n95\n00:05:27.457 --> 00:05:29.053\nSo what I'm gonna do is,\n\n96\n00:05:29.053 --> 00:05:33.330\nI'm gonna have a common operating\nenvironment that I want set up.\n\n97\n00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.140\nAnd my guys internally will set that up,\nand then we'll ship that image\n\n98\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.780\noff to whoever's doing the outsites\ninstead of giving us these systems.\n\n99\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.465\nAnd they'll apply that image to\nthe systems before they ship,\n\n100\n00:05:43.465 --> 00:05:47.801\nso we have them so they're plug and\nplay, for all intents and purposes.\n\n101\n00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:51.319\nThat's done, but then the question is,\nif they're installing that stuff in there,\n\n102\n00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:53.888\nwell, if someone else is doing it,\nwho's actually doing it?\n\n103\n00:05:53.888 --> 00:05:56.194\nAnd did they actually\njust put that on there,\n\n104\n00:05:56.194 --> 00:05:58.895\nor is there other things\nthat went on with it?\n\n105\n00:05:58.895 --> 00:06:02.155\nThat's being paranoid, but\nit does pay to be paranoid in some cases.\n\n106\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.850\nSo you have that right after you acquire\nit, and you get into the ownership phase.\n\n107\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.056\nThen you have the whole\ntime where it's being used.\n\n108\n00:06:12.056 --> 00:06:16.873\nAnd keep in mind in most companies,\nas I'm sure all of you know from\n\n109\n00:06:16.873 --> 00:06:21.830\nworking in these corporate\nenvironments and being around it.\n\n110\n00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.487\nYou know that computers don't necessarily\nstay being used by the same person all\n\n111\n00:06:26.487 --> 00:06:27.111\nthe time.\n\n112\n00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:32.914\nThey can be shifted around and\nbe in different departments,\n\n113\n00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:37.363\nand handling and\nprocessing different data.\n\n114\n00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:40.083\nWhen we move to those different roles,\nthose are different things that\n\n115\n00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:42.865\nthe computer has to be not only evaluated\nfor to see if it can handle that.\n\n116\n00:06:42.865 --> 00:06:47.061\nBut also to see when they move over\nto the new one, no matter what it is,\n\n117\n00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:50.490\nare you getting rid of\nthe old stuff off of that?\n\n118\n00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.060\nSo that comes in to play.\n\n119\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.302\nSo that's another big part of it.\n\n120\n00:06:54.302 --> 00:07:00.085\nAnd then, eventually computers come to\nthe end of their life cycle period.\n\n121\n00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:03.274\nDepending on what your\nsituation actually merits,\n\n122\n00:07:03.274 --> 00:07:07.041\nthere can be a decommissioning,\na formal decommissioning,\n\n123\n00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:10.673\nwhich is where they break a bottle\nof champagne [INAUDIBLE].\n\n124\n00:07:10.673 --> 00:07:14.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You feel free to do that though.\n\n125\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.422\nBut it's where they take the machine,\nand they get it ready for\n\n126\n00:07:18.422 --> 00:07:21.733\nwhatever fate awaits it,\nI guess is the way to put it.\n\n127\n00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:25.117\nBecause it could be that system's\njust gonna be disposed of, or\n\n128\n00:07:25.117 --> 00:07:28.530\nit's gonna go back to\nwhoever you leased it from.\n\n129\n00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.270\nAnd what you want to do is you want to\nmake sure that system is prepped in\n\n130\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:38.820\nthe right way to go wherever its\nnext destination happens to be.\n\n131\n00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.041\nSo that means that when you take that\nsystem, it could mean the difference\n\n132\n00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:46.665\nbetween just wiping the drive,\nhanding the system over as is.\n\n133\n00:07:46.665 --> 00:07:50.278\nOr you can do stuff like reach in and\ngrab the drive and\n\n134\n00:07:50.278 --> 00:07:54.978\nrip it out and that gets shredded or\nsmelted or something like that.\n\n135\n00:07:54.978 --> 00:07:56.626\nAll those different\nthings are on the table.\n\n136\n00:07:56.626 --> 00:07:58.485\nAnd depending on where you.\n\n137\n00:07:58.485 --> 00:08:00.812\nWhat industry you work in what\ndate you are working with.\n\n138\n00:08:00.812 --> 00:08:05.580\nWhat's your client's may even ask\nyou to do, or may require of you.\n\n139\n00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.690\nAll those things can be done.\n\n140\n00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.420\nI know plenty of for example.\n\n141\n00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.210\nHeck I remember seeing this.\n\n142\n00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.720\nOne of the first times\nI had heard about it,\n\n143\n00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.390\nI was really young when I\nheard about this is that.\n\n144\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:24.790\nOne of the companies near where I was\nborn and raised in Southern California.\n\n145\n00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:29.590\nThe company wanted to\nsupport the local schools.\n\n146\n00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.540\nSo it's a big aerospace company, and what\nthey want to do is, they wanted to say,\n\n147\n00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.810\nokay we've got a bunch of computers\nthat are coming off being useful for us,\n\n148\n00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.030\nand we just want to\ndonate them to a school.\n\n149\n00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.990\nHey, that's really cool,\nthe school was really happy.\n\n150\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.740\nDude because things were really\nexpensive in that point in time.\n\n151\n00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:49.290\nSo they got all these computers,\nthe company\n\n152\n00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:53.250\neven brought them down to the school and\nsaid we'll take care of that, you don't\n\n153\n00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.990\nhave to send anybody over, we'll bring\nthem over there, we want to help you out.\n\n154\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.740\nAnd so\nthey brought a bunch of computers over.\n\n155\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.560\nThey sat,\nthe school couldn't do anything with them.\n\n156\n00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.538\nAnd the reason is that none of\nthe computers had hard drives in them.\n\n157\n00:09:07.538 --> 00:09:10.139\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The school was already excited\n\n158\n00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:13.460\nbecause they were getting computers.\n\n159\n00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.210\nSchools traditionally do not have really\ngood budgets, so they were happy.\n\n160\n00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.490\nIt's like we've got all\nthese computers in here.\n\n161\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.550\nThis was like in the early 90s.\n\n162\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.352\nSo they get computers,\n\n163\n00:09:26.352 --> 00:09:29.716\nit's kind of like you've got a bunch\nof paperweights really is what you got.\n\n164\n00:09:29.716 --> 00:09:33.608\nBecause they didn't have the money to put\nhard drives in each and every one of them,\n\n165\n00:09:33.608 --> 00:09:37.080\nbecause the hard drives were\nstill expensive at that point.\n\n166\n00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.100\nBut that was what my mom had been\nworking at the school at the time,\n\n167\n00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.900\nshe goes why would they do that.\n\n168\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.920\nIt's like because they're working\nwith classified information and\n\n169\n00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.060\ntop secret information.\n\n170\n00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.030\nThe federal government will\nnot allow them to do that.\n\n171\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.260\nSo either you take it like that,\nthe way they are, or you don't get them.\n\n172\n00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.710\nSo it was unfortunate for them, but\n\n173\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.520\nthat aside, that's something that can and\ndoes happen.\n\n174\n00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.222\nIt just all depends.\n\n175\n00:10:03.222 --> 00:10:05.602\n>> You used to see that a lot more\nwhere it was kind of exciting.\n\n176\n00:10:05.602 --> 00:10:07.953\nSome company would be\nupgrading their network, and\n\n177\n00:10:07.953 --> 00:10:09.830\nthey'd be getting rid of surplus parts.\n\n178\n00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.270\nAnd the employees would\ntypically fight over it.\n\n179\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.970\nLike oh, I wanna take that router home,\nor I want that device or what have you.\n\n180\n00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:20.260\nOr they would let people know that,\nhey you can come by on this weekend and\n\n181\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.470\nwe're going to put all this stuff out,\nand you can take what you want.\n\n182\n00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.330\nBecause they're not using it anymore.\n\n183\n00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.270\nThat was great.\n\n184\n00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.070\nGreat way to build up your little test\nlab at home and things like that.\n\n185\n00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.470\nYou just don't see that anymore.\n\n186\n00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.795\nAt least most responsible\ncompanies aren't going to do that.\n\n187\n00:10:30.795 --> 00:10:35.930\nBecayse even routers and things like\nthat could have valuable information or\n\n188\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.250\nconfidential information on them.\n\n189\n00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.630\nAnd they're just not gonna take\na chance on letting that out.\n\n190\n00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.230\nIt seems like nowadays people will\ndestroy it before they would think about\n\n191\n00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.590\ngiving it away.\n\n192\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.620\nYeah that says a lot\nmore of that paranoia.\n\n193\n00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.240\nAs I've been saying with that,\n\n194\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.350\nis companies are a lot more careful\nabout the disposing of just equipment.\n\n195\n00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.010\nBecause they don't know.\n\n196\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.610\nI mean a lot of these\nthings you may look at.\n\n197\n00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.810\nAnd I am totally with you on it.\n\n198\n00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.910\nThey might look at and say that hardware\nthat It couldn't really hold anything\n\n199\n00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:11.620\nthat's really meaningful, but\nI'm of the mindset if I don't know for\n\n200\n00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.560\nsure, I'm not just gonna say okay,\nit's fine.\n\n201\n00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.430\nNo, I'm gonna err on the side of caution.\n\n202\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:22.490\nI will rather see it sit and collect dust\nin my closet or storage area someplace.\n\n203\n00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.440\nOr have it smashed ,or shredded or\nmelted down.\n\n204\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.810\nWhatever, rather than take that chance,\nbecause that's too high of a risk.\n\n205\n00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.340\nAnd it's really not my decision if I'm\nworking for a company, it's something I\n\n206\n00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.990\nhave a responsibility to the company,\nto the customers of that company,\n\n207\n00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.950\nall that to make sure that doesn't\nfall into the wrong hands.\n\n208\n00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.940\nYou do see them,\nyou do still see situations like that, but\n\n209\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.925\nit's not nearly as much as it used to be.\n\n210\n00:11:47.925 --> 00:11:52.005\nI know here you can do, there's a name for\n\n211\n00:11:52.005 --> 00:11:57.135\nit, but the military here,\nwell just the government period,\n\n212\n00:11:57.135 --> 00:12:02.390\nhere the federal government has\na way of disposing equipment that's\n\n213\n00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:07.480\nnot classified or sensitive, and you can\nget some extremely good deals on them.\n\n214\n00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.990\nBut it's not something that would work\nthe same way as it did before with\n\n215\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.330\nthe company,\nwhere well we're coming by like you said.\n\n216\n00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:19.940\nIt's something that's a lot more restrain,\na lot more careful with.\n\n217\n00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.320\nBut if you keep your eyes open,\nyeah you still get some good deals.\n\n218\n00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.220\n>> I tell you that my girlfriends\nwith the Coast Guard.\n\n219\n00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.000\nAnd when they dispose of equipment\nthat's no longer necessary,\n\n220\n00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.380\nthey can take it down\nto their disposal unit.\n\n221\n00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.760\nAnd they've got their\nprocedures that'll go through.\n\n222\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.380\nOr if they want they can try to donate it,\nor repurpose that.\n\n223\n00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:43.170\nBut the amount of paperwork that they have\nto go through, to do that repurposing,\n\n224\n00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.960\nor to think about giving it to a school or\nsomething like that, they don't bother.\n\n225\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.800\nIt just go straight to the disposal,\nbecause there's too much that has to be\n\n226\n00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.920\ndone to that equipment before they\ncan just give it to somebody.\n\n227\n00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.720\nYou know I was just picturing when you\nstarted that you were going to say\n\n228\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.230\nno my girlfriend's the Coast Guard.\n\n229\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.980\nI've met her, I was just picturing\nyou said that with computer stuff and\n\n230\n00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.520\nwe're talk about disposal.\n\n231\n00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.860\nI'm like going is that what she's doing\non her drill weekends around the boat and\n\n232\n00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.121\njust kicking it off into the water.\n\n233\n00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.684\nIt's like [NOISE]\n>> It's like I know what you do now.\n\n234\n00:13:10.684 --> 00:13:11.798\n[LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n235\n00:13:11.798 --> 00:13:14.802\nall those artificial reefs that we have\nout here in Florida that's where they\n\n236\n00:13:14.802 --> 00:13:15.503\nstart is the old.\n\n237\n00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:16.617\n>> It's like we're disposing stuff.\n\n238\n00:13:16.617 --> 00:13:21.059\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right another thing you've got\n\n239\n00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:21.760\nlisted on here.\n\n240\n00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.978\nUnderstanding the results\nof Solutions in advance.\n\n241\n00:13:23.978 --> 00:13:27.960\nThis is where we talk about change\nmanagement, or what are we doing there?\n\n242\n00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.500\n>> Well, that is part of it.\n\n243\n00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:36.300\nChange management is still\ndifferent enough from this, or\n\n244\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:42.738\nit's a whole topic unto itself, that this\nis just one piece that fits in there.\n\n245\n00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:47.589\nThe thing is it's really when you get\ndown to the results of anything you put\n\n246\n00:13:47.589 --> 00:13:48.285\nin place.\n\n247\n00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:51.940\nMaking sure you understand them is,\nit's a case of,\n\n248\n00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.990\nwell what we want to do is understand\nas someone who is handling security.\n\n249\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.680\nAnd you should really be\ndoing this with anything.\n\n250\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.240\nI'd make a case if you told\nme in IT that you just don't\n\n251\n00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.580\nhave to worry about those type of stuff,\nI'd say you are crazy.\n\n252\n00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.275\nYou're really kind of just go through and\n\n253\n00:14:08.275 --> 00:14:12.050\njust put a system in place and\nkind of dive in and hope it works.\n\n254\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.100\nNo you're not gonna do that.\n\n255\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.910\nYou should always be thinking what\nhappens when you make any changes.\n\n256\n00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:17.630\nYou introduce\n\n257\n00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.260\nanything into that environment\nwhat could be the implications.\n\n258\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.500\nThat's where testing and research and all\nthat comes in, is if you do those things,\n\n259\n00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.920\nyou should have a good understanding\nof what introducing that into\n\n260\n00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.150\nthe environment does.\n\n261\n00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.780\nIt's not always clear though.\n\n262\n00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.340\nDon't expect to get every answer.\n\n263\n00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.825\nThat's why it's not uncommon when you're\ntalking about, you know, bringing in and\n\n264\n00:14:36.825 --> 00:14:38.465\nintegrating new technology.\n\n265\n00:14:38.465 --> 00:14:41.355\nThat's why we have those sayings like,\nI think we had mentioned it here,\n\n266\n00:14:41.355 --> 00:14:43.165\nwe called them pilot programs.\n\n267\n00:14:43.165 --> 00:14:45.315\nCompanies do pilot programs or\nif they get large,\n\n268\n00:14:45.315 --> 00:14:48.837\nif you're talking sufficiently large\ncompany, and they have thousands, and\n\n269\n00:14:48.837 --> 00:14:51.717\nthousands, and thousands of people in it.\n\n270\n00:14:51.717 --> 00:14:55.177\nThey may say, okay well we have all these\ndifferent user groups, and all these\n\n271\n00:14:55.177 --> 00:14:59.450\ndifferent populations of uses that we can\nidentify with similar usage patterns.\n\n272\n00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.090\nSo we're gonna identify the power users\nin those groups, is usually what they do.\n\n273\n00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.310\nAnd we're gonna say, we're identifying\npower users because they will beat on\n\n274\n00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:11.210\nthat system more, and they will also\nknow how to provide information on their\n\n275\n00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.660\nusage of that system,\nto give us something that we can act on.\n\n276\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.650\nIt's not something like\na regular user that's gonna say,\n\n277\n00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.160\noh I click on this button and\nit doesn't work.\n\n278\n00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.090\nLike, well, we need more information than\nthat, and we also need you to understand\n\n279\n00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.680\nthat clicking on that button is not\ngonna do what you think it's gonna do.\n\n280\n00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.616\nIt's, you just don't have\nthe level of knowledge to use\n\n281\n00:15:34.616 --> 00:15:38.224\nthe system the way we're looking for\nat this point.\n\n282\n00:15:38.224 --> 00:15:43.290\nSo, we wanna get pilot programs set up,\nand the pilot programs look for\n\n283\n00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.861\nhow people use that technology,\nand how they interact with it.\n\n284\n00:15:47.861 --> 00:15:52.359\nAnd feedback comes in, and so that also\ngives you a better idea of the changes\n\n285\n00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:55.873\nThe problems, or issues, or\nimprovements what have you,\n\n286\n00:15:55.873 --> 00:15:59.340\nthat the introduction of this\nnew technology is gonna do.\n\n287\n00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.990\nCuz you really, quite frankly,\n\n288\n00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:06.100\ndon't know as any sort of user or\nIT person, you don't really have a full\n\n289\n00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.160\nunderstanding of what the implication of\nbringing that technology is gonna be.\n\n290\n00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.060\nAnd as much as you try to anticipate it,\nI would almost say and\n\n291\n00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.140\nI don't think anyone here would be kinda\nwilling to jump off that cliff into this\n\n292\n00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.130\nand say, oh yeah, I understand\nclearly what's gonna happen with it.\n\n293\n00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:28.020\nNo, you kinda don't,\ncan't understand everything because.\n\n294\n00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.760\nYou're not the other users,\nyou don't see it from their stand point.\n\n295\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.450\nSomeone in design,\nsomeone in software development,\n\n296\n00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.210\nsomeone that's doing administrative work.\n\n297\n00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:41.300\nEach one of those people is using\nthat system in a certain way.\n\n298\n00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.980\nThat's the different\nsomehow from everyone else.\n\n299\n00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.580\nSo you can't anticipate that,\nif you haven't been there.\n\n300\n00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.760\nSo you're trying to get people on a pilot\nprogram to use those things however\n\n301\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.310\nthey normally use it, and they can log\nthese problems, and you can see, okay,\n\n302\n00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.930\nis that an adjustment I can make that\nwon't impact the other people over here?\n\n303\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.580\nI can see what common\nissues they're having and\n\n304\n00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.540\nyou can iron those out before\nit goes into production.\n\n305\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.480\nBut it's really,\nreally tricky, it's tricky but\n\n306\n00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.930\ndoable to anticipate\nthe problems you might have.\n\n307\n00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.420\nYou always wanna anticipate the problems,\nwhatever problems you can.\n\n308\n00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.480\nYou're going to have ones\nthat are going to pop up.\n\n309\n00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.680\nNo one's saying you won't.\n\n310\n00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.490\nBut you have to anticipate those things.\n\n311\n00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.640\nAnd you have a lot of options and\nthings at your disposal to do it.\n\n312\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.498\nI mean you can find tons\nof papers on how to do,\n\n313\n00:17:25.498 --> 00:17:29.315\non how to conduct a pilot\nprogram successfully.\n\n314\n00:17:29.315 --> 00:17:32.195\nAnd a lot of companies have adopted\nthat just because they're getting\n\n315\n00:17:32.195 --> 00:17:33.135\ngood information.\n\n316\n00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:37.845\nIt's not some techie or IT person that's\nsitting there setting the whole thing up,\n\n317\n00:17:37.845 --> 00:17:39.895\nand saying okay this looks good,\nit works good for me.\n\n318\n00:17:39.895 --> 00:17:42.245\nWell of course it works good for you,\nyou know how to use the system and\n\n319\n00:17:42.245 --> 00:17:43.865\nyou set it up, I hope it does.\n\n320\n00:17:43.865 --> 00:17:46.775\nBut let's identify these other people.\n\n321\n00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:50.175\nCompanies have kind of learned over\nthe years to get a little more complete\n\n322\n00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:53.840\ninformation, you know ,from their\nenvironment before they do it.\n\n323\n00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.590\nThat's heck, that's one of the purposes\nwhen you look at something like Windows 10\n\n324\n00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.470\nor any software product.\n\n325\n00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.030\nThey have the pre-alpha out.\n\n326\n00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.580\nThey have the beta, you know test.\n\n327\n00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.910\nThat and\nthe open beta that goes out to the public,\n\n328\n00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.730\nwhere everyone can beat on it\nbecause they are increasing\n\n329\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.460\nwhen they do the pre-alpha stuff and\nthe in house stuff.\n\n330\n00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.000\nYou know before that, they are checking\nfor to see how well it works.\n\n331\n00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.770\nHow close they are to the end goal.\n\n332\n00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:18.120\nAnd as they get closer and closer,\nand iron out more of those bugs,\n\n333\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.720\nand deficiencies,\nthey could open it up to wider and\n\n334\n00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.180\nwider populations because they've\naddressed some of these earlier problems.\n\n335\n00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.550\nAt some point it's good enough and working\nwell enough, but not good enough to ship,\n\n336\n00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:33.730\nthey can introduce it to\nthe public as an open beta,\n\n337\n00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:38.580\nwhere they can try it, use it, and\nhopefully when you open it up that far.\n\n338\n00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.470\nYeah, we're gonna get people that just\nuse it to have the latest and greatest.\n\n339\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.770\nAnd then we're gonna have people that\nare actually gonna submit stuff back.\n\n340\n00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.770\nSo, and then we can use that to tweak it.\n\n341\n00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:52.770\nThat's why, when you saw with Windows 10,\nthere was talk about the fact that\n\n342\n00:18:53.900 --> 00:19:00.060\neven up to about a week before\nIt became live, where people\n\n343\n00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.970\ncould fully download and activate it, that\nit was still having updates applied to it.\n\n344\n00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:10.680\nThey were still slipstreaming stuff\ninto it as they made changes.\n\n345\n00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.130\nIt's kinda cool they could do that.\n\n346\n00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.820\nThat means that the way they did it with,\nand\n\n347\n00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.400\nthis is something that shows this\nlifecycle type thing as well.\n\n348\n00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.630\nMicrosoft really planned\nthat out pretty well.\n\n349\n00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.530\nBecause even though it's the first time\nsomeone's really done something on\n\n350\n00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:26.610\nthat scale, they did really kinda\ndo something really neat there.\n\n351\n00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.800\nBecause if you think about it, in the\nsoftware industry before, if you look at\n\n352\n00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:35.500\nan older version, if you look at Windows\n8 for example, that you get on DVD.\n\n353\n00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.080\nThose DVDs were pressed\na substantial amount of ahead time.\n\n354\n00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.880\nThat could have been like two months ahead\nof time that someone inside the company\n\n355\n00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.720\nsaid this is the gold master.\n\n356\n00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.530\nAnd they pressed a bunch of those things.\n\n357\n00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.950\nThe company I was with years\nago we were the fourth.\n\n358\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.520\nAnd they still are the fourth largest\nsoftware company in the world.\n\n359\n00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.040\nThe company would make a gold master,\nand they'd have one for\n\n360\n00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.260\nthe states, and they had ones that\nwere localized different areas.\n\n361\n00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.970\nAnd they would get those ones set up and\n\n362\n00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.910\nthen distribute those out\nto different places, and\n\n363\n00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:09.120\nthose would get bunches of CDs and stuff\nlike that master edand distribute it out.\n\n364\n00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.850\nThat takes a substantial period\nof time to get those things,\n\n365\n00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.410\nget tons of those masters, get\nthe manuals printed if they're in there.\n\n366\n00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.730\nGet them in the box,\nget them to the appropriate location.\n\n367\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.290\nThese vendors,\njust can't have them show up the same day.\n\n368\n00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:25.680\nPeople always have this vision I see that,\nwhen a new product releases in anything,\n\n369\n00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.710\nsomeone's wheeling the dolly in and\nthe trucks coming in,\n\n370\n00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.490\ntossing them off the back.\n\n371\n00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.670\nThat's done for dramatic purposes.\n\n372\n00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:37.420\nMost places,\nthe product I dealt with when I was down,\n\n373\n00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.900\nbefore I went to the main company, and\nI was working for one of the resellers,\n\n374\n00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.210\nwe had that product about a month or\nnot a month, a week ahead of time.\n\n375\n00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.400\nIt was sitting back there and you know\nsome of our customers already knew it.\n\n376\n00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.730\nIt's like we know you have it, can't you\njust give it, because we paid for it.\n\n377\n00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.300\nIt's like we're not allowed,\nit's embargoed, we can't do that.\n\n378\n00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.360\nYou know they just want to make sure\neveryone's got their supply and\n\n379\n00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.990\nall that's taken care of.\n\n380\n00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:03.340\nWith what Microsoft did since they don't\nhave that physical media, they can go up\n\n381\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:08.890\nto a substantially closer to release time\nbefore they say okay, we're going to stop.\n\n382\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:13.660\nIn their case, they stopped about a week\nor ten days ahead of time to make sure\n\n383\n00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.670\nthat those updates they had time to\ntrickle out to everyone that had them.\n\n384\n00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.280\nBecause if they kept doing it\nuntil a couple day before,\n\n385\n00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.660\nyeah well that would be\na little problematic there,\n\n386\n00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.200\nbecause not everyone is gonna\nbe getting them immediately.\n\n387\n00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.790\nThey have to be trickled out, so\nit doesn't overwhelm networks and\n\n388\n00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.450\nstuff like that.\n\n389\n00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:36.390\nBut still you're getting something that's\ncloser, they had a little bit more\n\n390\n00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:40.330\ndevelopment time than they would've had,\nIf they did it the traditional way.\n\n391\n00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.640\n>> And then last thing that we want to\ntalk about there is addressing emergent\n\n392\n00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.930\nthreats and security trends.\n\n393\n00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.820\nI know it's something that we've\ntalked about in other episodes.\n\n394\n00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.600\nWe just want to redress that.\n\n395\n00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.305\n>> Yeah, just the.\n\n396\n00:21:51.305 --> 00:21:54.715\n>> That's the other that fits\ninto this whole picture.\n\n397\n00:21:54.715 --> 00:21:58.285\nYou know, we're not really\ngoing to introduce anything\n\n398\n00:21:58.285 --> 00:22:02.385\nnew here as far as threats go, but we have\nto talk about how that fits into the and\n\n399\n00:22:02.385 --> 00:22:06.235\nthen dictates the lifecycle of\nyour products, whatever they are.\n\n400\n00:22:06.235 --> 00:22:10.225\nWhat you have here, when we're\ndealing with these products, and\n\n401\n00:22:10.225 --> 00:22:12.925\nnew threats, is it's gonna happen.\n\n402\n00:22:12.925 --> 00:22:15.030\nAnd count on it by the way.\n\n403\n00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:20.600\n>> This is one of the issues I've got\nwhen companies don't have a really\n\n404\n00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:27.550\nstreamlined and workable way of getting\nnew technology into the workplace.\n\n405\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.690\nYou have to find amongst all\nthis other stuff you're doing,\n\n406\n00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.720\nI know you're juggling a lot\nof stuff now at this point.\n\n407\n00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.260\nBut you've got to think with\nall the stuff you're doing.\n\n408\n00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:43.120\nWhat you have to come up with\nis a way when new things emerge.\n\n409\n00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.020\nHow is that going to impact\nwhat you've already done.\n\n410\n00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.630\nIf it's a big enough problem, you're\nactually gonna say whatever I'm gonna\n\n411\n00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.840\nignore and\nkeep implementing it that would be stupid.\n\n412\n00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.290\nYou're really making a big problem for\nyourself.\n\n413\n00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:57.360\nWhat you need to do is have a system\nthat says, okay, these things come in.\n\n414\n00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.820\nWhat does that mean to this product?\n\n415\n00:22:58.820 --> 00:22:59.720\nWhat changes do I need to make?\n\n416\n00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.210\nIs there a configuration that's bad?\n\n417\n00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.510\nIs there anything I need to do?\n\n418\n00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.150\nMaybe I need even to rollback some stuff.\n\n419\n00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.370\nThat's been known to happen as well,\n\n420\n00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.450\nin some extreme cases that's\nbeen known to happen.\n\n421\n00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:13.240\nSo what you want to do,\nis you want to have a method of\n\n422\n00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.900\nInvestigating stuff to see if it's serious\nenough that need to make a change.\n\n423\n00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:22.510\nOne of the things that I can talk about\nfrom you know, my earlier days, you know.\n\n424\n00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:27.070\nThe company I was talking\nabout that i was with.\n\n425\n00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.060\nI mean heck, I had a situation,\n\n426\n00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.970\nliterally had a situation there\nthat I can kind of fit in to this.\n\n427\n00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.613\nIt wasn't a security thing, but\n\n428\n00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:37.557\nit was something that would\nnone-the-less piss you off.\n\n429\n00:23:37.557 --> 00:23:42.515\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The product we had was shipping,\n\n430\n00:23:42.515 --> 00:23:47.373\nand it shipped out to To people in,\nit was already in the process\n\n431\n00:23:47.373 --> 00:23:51.980\nof shipping out to people in the US and\nin Europe they had it.\n\n432\n00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.460\nThere's already shipping out there.\n\n433\n00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.760\nWell I was supporting of people\nin the whole Asia Pacific region.\n\n434\n00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.240\nI was one of the people that handled that.\n\n435\n00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.840\nI was one of three people I believe,\nthat handled for\n\n436\n00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.240\na major product release\nI was like up here.\n\n437\n00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.700\nSomehow I got to the top\nof the food chain,\n\n438\n00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.610\nand that's because no one\nelse wanted to be up there.\n\n439\n00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.530\nLike hey Oriyano, you're in charge.\n\n440\n00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:13.540\nCool.\n\n441\n00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.260\nLike oh wait a minute,\nno one else wanted it, all right.\n\n442\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.830\nThis kind of sucks.\n\n443\n00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:22.235\nBut in any case, I have to mention that\npoint that I was up there because,\n\n444\n00:24:22.235 --> 00:24:26.712\nI carried a lot of weight, in a lot of\ndecisions I had to make at that point,\n\n445\n00:24:26.712 --> 00:24:30.107\ncuz what happened,\none of the things that happened is,\n\n446\n00:24:30.107 --> 00:24:33.385\nis they shipped that product\nto those other two geos.\n\n447\n00:24:33.385 --> 00:24:38.342\nWhen they shipped it out to Asia,\nthe product worked fine through almost all\n\n448\n00:24:38.342 --> 00:24:43.299\nof Asia, but when it got to Australia,\nthese guys had new products that they\n\n449\n00:24:43.299 --> 00:24:47.106\ncould install,\nbrand new ones that can install upgrade.\n\n450\n00:24:47.106 --> 00:24:50.932\nThe upgrade ones they install in,\nwould look at the current installation of\n\n451\n00:24:50.932 --> 00:24:54.180\nthe product ,and would just\nbring it up to the new one.\n\n452\n00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.190\nWell, what happened is every\nupgrade version of the product,\n\n453\n00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:00.760\nnot the new ones, just the upgrade ones,\nwhen you install the upgrade ones and\n\n454\n00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.210\ntry to put your product key in, or\n\n455\n00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.780\ntry to just let it upgrade it by finding\nit on your hard drive, it would fail.\n\n456\n00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.040\nThere was no way to work around it.\n\n457\n00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.250\nIt was a critical failure.\n\n458\n00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.190\nIt killed the installation.\n\n459\n00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.850\nThere was no way you could\ninstall that product.\n\n460\n00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.800\nAnd we got call, after call, after call.\n\n461\n00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.080\nAnd the two other guys that I was\nworking with in California on this,\n\n462\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:20.950\nthey're getting calls too.\n\n463\n00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.140\nAnd I said, wait a minute,\n\n464\n00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.382\nstarted looking at it, and we're saying,\nyeah this is definitely a problem.\n\n465\n00:25:26.382 --> 00:25:29.410\nIt's not, someone's got a defective copy,\ncuz we had someone shipped out,\n\n466\n00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:33.330\na couple people which we had replaced,\nwe had shipped out same thing.\n\n467\n00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.480\nIt wasn't everyone's, wasn't happening,\nso we looked at it, we said, okay.\n\n468\n00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.770\nYeah, we can see what's going on here.\n\n469\n00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:38.822\nJust with upgrades.\n\n470\n00:25:38.822 --> 00:25:42.630\nIt's only from a certain area, we\nsubmitted that problem to engineering, and\n\n471\n00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:46.460\nthey were saying no, no,\nno that can't be a problem.\n\n472\n00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.250\nBecause that's shipped out.\n\n473\n00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.130\nThat can't be a problem.\n\n474\n00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.830\nWe can get to work all day here.\n\n475\n00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.440\nAnd I'm like yeah, so\ncan I on this product and\n\n476\n00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.270\nthis version, but\nnot that version down there.\n\n477\n00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.060\nIt's like, that's not a problem.\n\n478\n00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.300\nAnd so at some point, this is something\nthat you also have to account for\n\n479\n00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.850\nin your process, and\nwe had it in our process.\n\n480\n00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:05.010\nIt could have been one of those situations\nwhere, in the past engineering would've\n\n481\n00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:09.330\nsaid, hey I don't know what they're doing\ndown there, but it's not a problem.\n\n482\n00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:10.910\nWe can't recreate it.\n\n483\n00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.290\nSo you know what?\n\n484\n00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:13.455\nWe're gonna ignore you.\n\n485\n00:26:13.455 --> 00:26:14.047\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n486\n00:26:14.047 --> 00:26:17.730\nin the past,\nthat could have very well happened,\n\n487\n00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.865\nat the time I was there, they had\nkinda put safeguards in the system.\n\n488\n00:26:21.865 --> 00:26:22.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So at that point,\n\n489\n00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.700\nwhen they kept saying no no,\nwe can't do it.\n\n490\n00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.990\nClearly when we were doing it,\nwe were getting it.\n\n491\n00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.520\nIf we simulated that environment exactly,\neven though we couldn't determine,\n\n492\n00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.820\nbecause we didn't have access\nto a code in our area.\n\n493\n00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:32.870\nWe knew it was a problem.\n\n494\n00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:37.130\nSo I just did what I had to.\n\n495\n00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.331\nWe had at that point,\nwe had about 15, 20 people call in,\n\n496\n00:26:40.331 --> 00:26:43.520\nsaying that they're\nhaving problems with it.\n\n497\n00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.540\nI just put a thing, and\nyou can imagine your software company,\n\n498\n00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.750\na really large software company,\n\n499\n00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.470\nI just went in, and put something in, and\nsaid, stop shipping it to that region.\n\n500\n00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.470\nI had some people that were really\nupset with me, and instead they said,\n\n501\n00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:54.790\nIt's not a problem.\n\n502\n00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.570\nYeah, it is a problem.\n\n503\n00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.345\nWell, no it isn't.\nThere was a big argument with the whole\n\n504\n00:26:59.345 --> 00:27:01.045\nthing, and\nI was getting yelled at and all that.\n\n505\n00:27:01.045 --> 00:27:02.355\nI was like, I don't care.\n\n506\n00:27:02.355 --> 00:27:06.215\nReally, it's a good thing I was\nreally arrogant at that time.\n\n507\n00:27:06.215 --> 00:27:07.760\nI say at that time, like I'm not now.\n\n508\n00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.753\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I stopped the shipment of it.\n\n509\n00:27:12.753 --> 00:27:18.127\nAnd after causing and forcing them,\nto do more testing on it,\n\n510\n00:27:18.127 --> 00:27:20.650\nI actually had to get the CEO\ninvolved if you can believe that too.\n\n511\n00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:25.290\nI mean it's got to be a big mess,\nand I was asked,\n\n512\n00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.220\nthe CEO and a few other people asked,\ndid you test it under their conditions.\n\n513\n00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.760\nNo we don't have to,\nit's the same product.\n\n514\n00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.850\nIt's not the same product.\n\n515\n00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.605\nThat's what they call it localization.\n\n516\n00:27:33.605 --> 00:27:35.555\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They went and tested the same thing,\n\n517\n00:27:35.555 --> 00:27:36.790\nguess what happened?\n\n518\n00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.590\nExact same problem popped up.\n\n519\n00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.880\nThey were saying,\nno there's no way it's happening.\n\n520\n00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.700\nYeah it was happening.\n\n521\n00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.670\nThey figured out that they\nhadn't put a certain sequence\n\n522\n00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.030\nof serial numbers in\nthe product to be upgraded.\n\n523\n00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:51.500\nSo this thing saw something\nfrom a certain sequence, and\n\n524\n00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.350\nit would say it's invalid and\nthen kick it back.\n\n525\n00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:54.890\nIt says you're not eligible to upgrade.\n\n526\n00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.310\nYou gotta buy a new copy,\neven though this person had one.\n\n527\n00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:01.340\nSo it was a mistake made in there,\nand yeah you should have seen me.\n\n528\n00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.350\nI was doing like touch down.\n\n529\n00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.400\nI don't even play football, but\n\n530\n00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.580\nI apparently know how to\ndo touch down dances.\n\n531\n00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.727\nAnd people are like mm, yeah.\n\n532\n00:28:06.727 --> 00:28:07.601\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n533\n00:28:07.601 --> 00:28:08.187\n>> Who's the man?\n\n534\n00:28:08.187 --> 00:28:10.430\n[INAUDIBLE] Behind him and all that.\n\n535\n00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:14.244\nSo yeah, I'm not a graceful winner,\nand I never claimed to be.\n\n536\n00:28:14.244 --> 00:28:14.748\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n537\n00:28:14.748 --> 00:28:17.343\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]\n\n538\n00:28:17.343 --> 00:28:18.649\n[LAUGH]\n>> I came and\n\n539\n00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:21.775\njust spike stuff in their office.\nAnything I found, I'd just grab something\n\n540\n00:28:21.775 --> 00:28:23.896\noff their desk and spike it.\nIf it broke, wasn't mine.\n\n541\n00:28:23.896 --> 00:28:25.526\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] But\n\n542\n00:28:25.526 --> 00:28:28.256\nI mean you guys get kind of the idea.\nThat you have to have a process.\n\n543\n00:28:28.256 --> 00:28:30.755\nAnd the whole moral of that story, and\n\n544\n00:28:30.755 --> 00:28:34.225\npurpose of that story, is saying\nthat there's a process put in place.\n\n545\n00:28:34.225 --> 00:28:38.505\nThat even though before\nsomeone could have just said,\n\n546\n00:28:38.505 --> 00:28:41.745\nhey we're gonna keep cruising\non because we only have 20 out\n\n547\n00:28:41.745 --> 00:28:45.435\nof the millions of users, we only have\n20 people in one region are doing it.\n\n548\n00:28:45.435 --> 00:28:46.065\nThat's not enough.\n\n549\n00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.640\nI saw that there was a trend\nthat was increasing, and\n\n550\n00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.480\nI wasn't gonna let that stone keep rolling\ndownhill and getting bigger, and bigger,\n\n551\n00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.160\nand bigger, and just mow somebody down.\n\n552\n00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.090\nI stopped it right there.\n\n553\n00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.790\nI said, now there's a problem, I can see\nit and I'm not gonna let it get worse.\n\n554\n00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:01.780\nIt's done.\n\n555\n00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.730\nThere was something introduced\nin that system that said,\n\n556\n00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:08.240\nwell, because they've learned from\na problem in the past, by the way.\n\n557\n00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.730\nThey said, let's have something that if\nit's big enough and someone really wants\n\n558\n00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:16.450\nto stick by their guns and say, yeah,\nI really believe there's a problem here,\n\n559\n00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:20.815\nthat they can say, yeah, do this and\nit will be double checked.\n\n560\n00:29:20.815 --> 00:29:24.680\nAnd the CEO got involved because, they\neven had a mechanism in that system that\n\n561\n00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.490\nsaid, if you are getting pushed around and\ngetting garbage and all that,\n\n562\n00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:30.080\nfrom the people in that department.\n\n563\n00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.400\nAnd engineering that are saying no,\nno, we know what's best and all that.\n\n564\n00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.710\nSo whoever it is,\nyou can bring in that fire power.\n\n565\n00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.290\nAnd even though that CEO\nwasn't an expert in the area,\n\n566\n00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.550\nthey would say what's going on here?\n\n567\n00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.150\nWhy aren't you paying attention to this?\n\n568\n00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:45.790\nWhy are you shining that person off?\n\n569\n00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.172\nThat's what I had to have happened.\n\n570\n00:29:47.172 --> 00:29:48.940\nAnd fortunately,\n\n571\n00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:53.660\nin that situation, that option was\nthere and it discovered a problem.\n\n572\n00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.990\nUltimately, as far as I was concerned,\n\n573\n00:29:54.990 --> 00:30:00.410\nas long as our customers were able to\nuse the stuff, that was my goal and\n\n574\n00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:04.160\nI got it accomplished, I didn't care and\nI also got to say I told you so.\n\n575\n00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.617\nAnd slash tires.\n\n576\n00:30:05.617 --> 00:30:07.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But that's it.\n\n577\n00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:08.660\nThat's what you gotta have.\n\n578\n00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.840\nYou have to have a system that's flexible,\nand has that type of stuff built in.\n\n579\n00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.840\nThat will help you,\nif a new threat comes out,\n\n580\n00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.715\nsomeone who's in the know can jump in and\nsay, there's a new issue here.\n\n581\n00:30:18.715 --> 00:30:20.625\nI know it, I feel it, I see it.\n\n582\n00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:21.935\nHere's my proof.\n\n583\n00:30:21.935 --> 00:30:23.005\nAnd we need to adapt to it.\n\n584\n00:30:23.005 --> 00:30:25.525\n>> All right,\nwell I'll tell you what Sean,\n\n585\n00:30:25.525 --> 00:30:28.275\na lot of great information there\non what we need to be aware of,\n\n586\n00:30:28.275 --> 00:30:31.395\nas our technologies move through\ntheir life cycle in our organization.\n\n587\n00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:37.250\nAnything else you want to\nthrow into this episode?\n\n588\n00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.470\n>> No not really.\nYou want to see my touchdown stuff.\n\n589\n00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.600\n[LAUGH]\n>> We'll rewind that and\n\n590\n00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.280\nwatch that a couple times I'm sure.\n\n591\n00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.241\nMaybe we can make that\na part of our blooper reels.\n\n592\n00:30:44.241 --> 00:30:47.070\n[LAUGH]\n>> That should be our guys opening.\n\n593\n00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:49.800\nAll right well ladies and gentlemen.\n\n594\n00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.810\nI hope you enjoyed that you\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n595\n00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.270\nI know we had a great time making it.\n\n596\n00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.010\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n597\n00:30:55.010 -->

00:00:17.510\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is the famous Shawn Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.440\nHow you doing Shawn?\n\n5\n00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.000\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.200\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.770\nExcited to be here because we\nhave another one of our CompTIA\n\n8\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.840\nadvanced security practitioner\nepisodes coming your way, and\n\n9\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.280\nthis one we're going to take a look at\nvalidating system design, Sean, so kind of\n\n10\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.880\nalong the same lines that we've been\ntalking about in the last couple episodes.\n\n11\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.480\n>> Yeah, that's really where we're headed.\n\n12\n00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.330\nThis is just kind of to cap off\nthe whole discussion so to speak on\n\n13\n00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.690\nchecking out a system and making sure\nit meets your specific requirements.\n\n14\n00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.220\nSo, everything we've done kinda\nleads to this point about it.\n\n15\n00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.660\nSo, what we have is when we acquire\na system, really of any sort.\n\n16\n00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.040\nThis is gonna be just generic\nreally when you get down to it.\n\n17\n00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.280\nWhen we talk about getting a system,\nyou get system from a third party,\n\n18\n00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.880\nyou go through that acquisition process,\nbut at some point you need to make changes\n\n19\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.720\nto what that solution is,\nwhich is gonna happen.\n\n20\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.620\nReally no solution Is\njust dropped in place,\n\n21\n00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.770\nand it just stays that way ad infinitum.\n\n22\n00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.940\nThere's gonna be changes made, whether\nit's just minor configuration changes or\n\n23\n00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.470\nmajor overhauls, there will be changes.\n\n24\n00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.555\nSo we wanna make sure that when that\nsystem's acquired first of all,\n\n25\n00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:34.525\nthe design is acquired or implemented\nduring the implementation phase,\n\n26\n00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:38.425\nis it really something that is\nmeeting what it's supposed to, or\n\n27\n00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:41.797\nall the stuff there is\nit gonna meet my needs.\n\n28\n00:01:41.797 --> 00:01:45.667\nNow we did actually talk about that\nin other places with certification\n\n29\n00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:46.607\nand accreditation.\n\n30\n00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:49.307\nThat's something that happens during the\ninitial acquisition, that makes sure that\n\n31\n00:01:49.307 --> 00:01:54.287\nthat system meets its specs and\ndelivers on its promises to some degree.\n\n32\n00:01:54.287 --> 00:02:00.197\nRemember a system does not have to deliver\non every promise for it to be validated.\n\n33\n00:02:00.197 --> 00:02:04.847\nIt's up to a accreditation\nmanager to decide whether or\n\n34\n00:02:04.847 --> 00:02:08.150\nnot that something is going to be used or\nnot.\n\n35\n00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.968\nThey can say because it is missing\na couple of features but they are not deal\n\n36\n00:02:10.968 --> 00:02:14.480\nbreakers, we will go ahead and give\nthat our blessing with the understanding\n\n37\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.310\nthat it either be fixed or that they're\njust going to be okay to leave it as is.\n\n38\n00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.460\nSo you have that, but after that's\ndone and it's been rubber stamped and\n\n39\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.650\nput into production, so changes need to\nbe made of some sort, we just don't want\n\n40\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.280\nthose changes happening because someone\nfeels like they should be happening.\n\n41\n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.410\nYou know how that works right?\n\n42\n00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.950\n>> Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n43\n00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.450\nAnd it doesn't matter,\n\n44\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.245\nyou might think that you know every place\nthat that change is going to impact and\n\n45\n00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:43.285\ntypically it turns out that there's some\nother place that you didn't consider.\n\n46\n00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:45.595\nMaybe it's not part of\nyour job description or\n\n47\n00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:48.825\nyou didn't realize that these\npeople used it that way,\n\n48\n00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:52.210\nand you make that change and\nit breaks something somewhere else.\n\n49\n00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.540\nThat causes downtime,\ncalls to the help desk.\n\n50\n00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.510\nIt could hurt my network, open up\nsecurity holes, all kinds of things.\n\n51\n00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.950\nSo it's very important that\nwe have some process in place\n\n52\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.150\nthat a change has to go through\nbefore it's just put out.\n\n53\n00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.880\n>> Yeah, it's absolutely essential.\n\n54\n00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.270\nAnd as environments grow in size and\nyou're gonna get more and\n\n55\n00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.570\nmore people in them, what happens\nis that there's a potential for\n\n56\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.795\na big mess to occur when people\nstart just making changes.\n\n57\n00:03:20.795 --> 00:03:23.085\nAnd so you kind of want to\nhead that off at the pass and\n\n58\n00:03:23.085 --> 00:03:27.785\nhave a way of making sure that\nthose changes just don't happen cuz\n\n59\n00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:30.023\nsomeone decided it was a good idea or\ndid it on a whim.\n\n60\n00:03:30.023 --> 00:03:34.480\nI'm fine with someone deciding\nit's a good idea, and\n\n61\n00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.060\nmaking a proposal to make that change, but\n\n62\n00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.090\nI don't want them just saying that's\na good idea, the heck with those guys up\n\n63\n00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.800\nthere that don't understand my genius or\nwhatever I want to make the change.\n\n64\n00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.760\nAnd I think everyone in IT kind\nof goes through that phase.\n\n65\n00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.290\nI know I did it earlier in\nmy career I'm like yeah but\n\n66\n00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.595\nthe old dude up there don't know what's\ngoing on, I'll take care of this.\n\n67\n00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:56.320\nFortunately I was in a small business and\nat that point,\n\n68\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.420\nif there's anything to be said,\nand I at least grew out of it.\n\n69\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.955\n20 years later grew out of it finally.\n\n70\n00:04:01.955 --> 00:04:03.335\n>> [LAUGH] I'm glad you\nwere able to evolve.\n\n71\n00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:08.955\n>> I've developed new\ntechniques to annoy people.\n\n72\n00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:14.085\nSo, you're making these changes.\n\n73\n00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:18.175\nThe thing to really be aware\nof when you make changes and\n\n74\n00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:22.425\nthe reason why this process is in place,\n\n75\n00:04:22.425 --> 00:04:28.370\nis another way to look at it is if\nchange is a good idea, okay that's fine.\n\n76\n00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.020\nIf someone's determined that\na change looks like a good idea, and\n\n77\n00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.830\nthere's something that someone there\nthat's working in the trenches\n\n78\n00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.050\ndoing stuff, rather have them change it,\neven though it's a good idea,\n\n79\n00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.340\nrather than have them change it directly,\nI want them to go through the process.\n\n80\n00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.370\nTo get it up to someone\nwho's got the higher level\n\n81\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.600\nview to know how everything fits together.\n\n82\n00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.220\nSo while it may look like a good\nidea in context of that individual,\n\n83\n00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.870\nas it goes up the food chain and gets to\nsomebody that has a bigger picture they\n\n84\n00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.080\nsay yeah that's a good idea for\nthat person, but\n\n85\n00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.580\nthat's going to have far reaching impacts\nacross the whole system that we have.\n\n86\n00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.730\nBecause that change requires other\nthings that need to be done and\n\n87\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.870\nthat's just going to start\ncausing major ripples.\n\n88\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.683\nI remember, it's kind of a little bit of\na clunky analogy, but it kind of fits in,\n\n89\n00:05:20.683 --> 00:05:26.334\nis I knew somebody a colleague years ago\nthat worked on software development and\n\n90\n00:05:26.334 --> 00:05:31.224\nreally knew that extremely well and\nhe was making a comment that one of\n\n91\n00:05:31.224 --> 00:05:35.186\nthese really big products\nthat he had worked worked on,\n\n92\n00:05:35.186 --> 00:05:39.713\nyou're talking scores of developers and\neveryone else on it.\n\n93\n00:05:39.713 --> 00:05:43.974\nHe was talking about the fact that,\nyou couldn't just go in, even as much as\n\n94\n00:05:43.974 --> 00:05:48.801\nhe wanted to, and other people wanted to,\nthey couldn't just go in and change code.\n\n95\n00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:52.909\nBecause they knew how to rewrite code to\nmake it object oriented at that point of\n\n96\n00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.335\ntime and they were working on\nre-architecting the whole project\n\n97\n00:05:56.335 --> 00:05:59.032\nto be object oriented from\nwhat it had been before.\n\n98\n00:05:59.032 --> 00:06:02.470\nBut he said that why some of\nthe things weren't object oriented,\n\n99\n00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.656\nthey knew how to change over to the new\nstuff but the problem was, because some of\n\n100\n00:06:06.656 --> 00:06:10.844\nthis code had been in place for years and\nyears and years as the product evolved,\n\n101\n00:06:10.844 --> 00:06:14.471\nif they just went in without really\nfully analyzing everything, and\n\n102\n00:06:14.471 --> 00:06:16.685\ndoing consultation and testing.\n\n103\n00:06:16.685 --> 00:06:21.385\nIt would be like if you walked\ninto like a medieval castle or\n\n104\n00:06:21.385 --> 00:06:25.455\nsomething, you're touring a castle\nover in Europe some place, and\n\n105\n00:06:25.455 --> 00:06:27.715\nyou just walk in the front\ndoor on the tour and\n\n106\n00:06:27.715 --> 00:06:31.115\nyou just see one of these tapestries\nhas a little thread hanging off of it.\n\n107\n00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:34.280\nSo you go over being the good\nSamaritan that you are, and\n\n108\n00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.180\nyou go to pull that thread off and\nyou're like, okay, done, throw it away.\n\n109\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.550\nMeanwhile, while you think you pulled\nthe thread out of this thing and\n\n110\n00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.010\nflicked it off and\nthat's the end of it, meanwhile,\n\n111\n00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.032\nthe other side of the castle,\na whole wall is falling down.\n\n112\n00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:47.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like you just don't know that\n\n113\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.410\nthey were connected somehow,\nyou weren't aware of that.\n\n114\n00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.610\nNow that may seem little clunky and little\nkind of, it's humorous to think about it.\n\n115\n00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.070\nThat's kind of what we're looking at here\nis that someone just got a small view,\n\n116\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.060\nthey don't have the big\npicture type thing.\n\n117\n00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.460\nSo we have to make a change and\ngo through this whole thing.\n\n118\n00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.850\n>> Yeah that kinda falls into line\nof something I would say as well\n\n119\n00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.340\nwhen you talk about that big picture.\n\n120\n00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.606\nUsually when we look at project\nmanagement, department managers,\n\n121\n00:07:11.606 --> 00:07:17.490\nIT managers, security managers, like that,\nwe might have that six month to one year\n\n122\n00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.880\nview of things and\nwhere things are gonna be.\n\n123\n00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.450\nAs you go up in management\nthe view gets longer, right?\n\n124\n00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.919\nThose Cs, or\nC level executives are looking at\n\n125\n00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.040\nfive years, ten years down the road,\nwhere the company needs to be.\n\n126\n00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.520\nAnd so maybe one of these changes might\nseem like it would make sense to implement\n\n127\n00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.440\nnow, but that's because you don't see\nthe changes that are coming down the road.\n\n128\n00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.500\nAnd if you know about those,\nthe change wouldn't make so much sense.\n\n129\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.710\nSometimes we get that tunnel vision,\nwe think, oh yeah, and\n\n130\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.229\nkind of the same lines as,\nyou don't know what it's gonna effect,\n\n131\n00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:54.406\nyou also don't know what's gonna\nbe in place in the future.\n\n132\n00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:58.894\n>> That's really it when you start looking\nat it in terms of scope Starts clearing\n\n133\n00:07:58.894 --> 00:08:03.246\nit up and one of the things they try to\ndo here in the cast is, you know, we're\n\n134\n00:08:03.246 --> 00:08:07.990\nintroducing these things that hopefully\nyou already have some experience with.\n\n135\n00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.670\nNone of this should be,\n\n136\n00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.570\nthis whole body of knowledge that is\ncovered by the cast should not be\n\n137\n00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.230\nsomething that you are coming in saying\nthis is entirely brand new to me.\n\n138\n00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.450\nIt should be something\nthat you have at least,\n\n139\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.790\nyou should have some exposure to it.\n\n140\n00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:26.620\nThe thing is, and the trick is, when we\nget to being a casp type level person.\n\n141\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.390\nWe're taking it from that\nexposure that you had before,\n\n142\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.000\nto now getting a better understanding of\nit, and hopefully all these different\n\n143\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.320\nthings kind of weave together\nto form that big picture.\n\n144\n00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.940\nBecause now you may very well be the one\nthat is going to be, that has to approve\n\n145\n00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:46.564\nthose changes or disapprove those changes\nbecause you got someone down the trench\n\n146\n00:08:46.564 --> 00:08:50.670\nwho's provided that to you and said,\noh well, this is what should be done.\n\n147\n00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:55.360\nWell, you know, this is,\nthey've been telling you hey,\n\n148\n00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.990\nthis is what we should do\nto make a better change.\n\n149\n00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.790\nBut you're saying yeah, you're right but\nwe can't make that right now because of\n\n150\n00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.610\nother plans we have or\nother things in place.\n\n151\n00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.740\nAnd that could be something that just,\nin our case, impact security.\n\n152\n00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.990\nBut the security as far as confidentiality\nand integrity goes but it could also be\n\n153\n00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:19.530\nthe case it affects stability over all so\nwe want to have that situation where\n\n154\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.450\nsomeone can find the changes that need to\nbe made or they think needs to be made.\n\n155\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.150\nPropose that change.\n\n156\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.340\nAnd then when they propose that change,\nit goes up to someone to be reviewed and\n\n157\n00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.550\nthat's someone up at the higher\nlevels of the company.\n\n158\n00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.410\nThey check to see if needs\nto actually be done and\n\n159\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.200\nthen if it's something that can be done,\nit's approved and\n\n160\n00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.060\nthat's where the design and\ntesting and all that goes through.\n\n161\n00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.380\nThe formal design testing and all that\ngoes through and it's implemented.\n\n162\n00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.070\nAnd we even have a roll\nback plan in there.\n\n163\n00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:52.850\nAnd all this is all documented, so if\nsomeone down the road comes to that system\n\n164\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.700\nand we're not around, they can see\nthe documentation of the change.\n\n165\n00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.250\nThey can compare it against\nthe original design and\n\n166\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:05.100\nsay I can see the whole trail here\non why this is the way it is.\n\n167\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.190\nThat's the type of stuff\nthat we want to see.\n\n168\n00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.200\nThat's the really good way to do it.\n\n169\n00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.980\n>> And Sean that what you just mentioned\nthat rollback capability that's another\n\n170\n00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.190\nbig part of Change Management so at any\ntime during the implementation of this\n\n171\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:25.300\nchange something goes wrong we're not\nup your famous creek you talk about.\n\n172\n00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.485\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n173\n00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:27.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've stood in\n\n174\n00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.410\nthe middle of that creek actually.\n\n175\n00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:34.020\nYou weren't here yesterday, talk about\nship as in boat creek in Alaska.\n\n176\n00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:34.870\nI wanted.\n\n177\n00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.770\n>> Did you have a paddle?\n\n178\n00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:37.610\n>> I didn't, so.\n\n179\n00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.936\nYou're not supposed to have a paddle.\n\n180\n00:10:39.936 --> 00:10:42.370\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] There you in there and\ntake it.\n\n181\n00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.180\nLike, is it in the rules?\n\n182\n00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:49.460\n>> But the important part of\nChange Management is the fact that we got\n\n183\n00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.310\nour plans so it's something goes wrong,\nwe can get back to where we were,\n\n184\n00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.770\nas little downtime as possible.\n\n185\n00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:00.280\n>> That's really, if you're someone\nthat's really you know looking long term.\n\n186\n00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.540\nAnd you have the experience.\n\n187\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.940\nYou know that something can\ngo right a 100 times but\n\n188\n00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:10.210\nthere is a 101st time where it\nall breaks loose and it's a mess.\n\n189\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.870\nSo you have to have that roll back plan.\n\n190\n00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.270\nSo that's something that also gets\nbuilt in to this whole system\n\n191\n00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.420\nto make sure that that's taken care of.\n\n192\n00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.920\nSo if this is done right,\nthis whole process should work quite well.\n\n193\n00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.950\nBut there are to be sure\nchallenges with it.\n\n194\n00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:31.910\nOne of the biggest challenges I see with\nmaking system changes of any sort is, and\n\n195\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.040\nthe reason why people will try to\nmake this end run around you and\n\n196\n00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.550\ndecide well I'm going to do it anyway.\n\n197\n00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.240\nEven though you had that formal process.\n\n198\n00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.470\nIs if you make that process just\ntoo ridiculous and convoluted and\n\n199\n00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.780\nthey know they're going to get shot down,\nif they know that's going to happen,\n\n200\n00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.350\nthen they're just not going to follow it.\n\n201\n00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.530\nThey'll make a change.\n\n202\n00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.240\nIf you don't like it then well,\nboo-hoo for you.\n\n203\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.100\nThat's kind of the way\npeople could look at it.\n\n204\n00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.680\nYou definitely want to avoid\nthat line of thinking.\n\n205\n00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.120\nSo what we're going to do to make\nsure that that doesn't happen,\n\n206\n00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.978\nis we are going to make a system that\nis easy for someone to submit a change.\n\n207\n00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:11.560\nWe're going to make it an environment\nwhere when they submit and ask for that\n\n208\n00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.880\nchange, it's not something that they're\nimmediately going to get shot down on.\n\n209\n00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.040\nWe definitely do not want that.\n\n210\n00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.880\nIf anyone has that impression,\nno one likes to be told no, no,\n\n211\n00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.850\nno, no all the time.\n\n212\n00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.430\nYou're just going to say, to heck with it,\nI'm just not going to play this game.\n\n213\n00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.900\nSo they may not make changes but\nthey may not session improvements either.\n\n214\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.230\nSo that's something that\nyou do want to avoid.\n\n215\n00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.500\nSo you make it easy to\nsubmit something to system.\n\n216\n00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.020\nWe have a review process that works well\nand says okay, this is a good change and\n\n217\n00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:40.110\nif it's not a good change, we can at\nleast tell the person that reviewed it\n\n218\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.950\nthat change doesn't work because of this,\nthis, and this.\n\n219\n00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.770\nIf they did anticipate them, let them\nresubmit it as, explain why they accounted\n\n220\n00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.750\nfor that or why they think that that's\nnot a good one, you can decide that.\n\n221\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.710\nBut then once it goes through that\nyou have a quick process where it\n\n222\n00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:01.420\ngets formally blessed and everything else\ngets done it has to be a process where\n\n223\n00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:06.400\npeople feel that they should\nparticipate in not something that\n\n224\n00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.780\nthey're just going to fighting\na losing battle every time.\n\n225\n00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.300\nI've seen that and it just totally,\nit, totally destroys\n\n226\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.760\nyou know any type of change matter system\nyou have because people wont submit it.\n\n227\n00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.530\nRemember the one I was talking about,\n\n228\n00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.570\nwell you know several episodes ago where\nthat to make a change to group policy,\n\n229\n00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.590\nwhat would happen, they would have\nto submit it up the food chain.\n\n230\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:31.790\nIt would go someplace, and by the time it\ngot back to approve the change, not make\n\n231\n00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.520\nthe change, but approve the change could\nbe two to three months down the road.\n\n232\n00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.530\nAnd so by the time that had come around,\nthey just got it approved\n\n233\n00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:42.320\nwithout even creating it,\nthese people would invariably say,\n\n234\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.190\nwell we don't need it anymore or\nwe found a way to get around it.\n\n235\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.110\nImagine what the implication is\nwe found a way to get around it.\n\n236\n00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:56.000\nOkay, so I put a process in place to deal\nwith getting changes to group policy done.\n\n237\n00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.730\nI understand why you want\nto have a process for\n\n238\n00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.580\nthat considering the implications\nif you screw it up.\n\n239\n00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:05.450\nSo that goes through the whole process to\nmake sure it's improved and you're okay.\n\n240\n00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.540\nAnd to make sure everything's\ndone the way it's supposed to be,\n\n241\n00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.760\nthat security is maintained and you\nhave a nice consistent environment, and\n\n242\n00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.540\nall the reliability that goes with it.\n\n243\n00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.990\nSo you've got something that, a process\nin place that's supposed to ensure that.\n\n244\n00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:23.480\nBut you take so long that even\nthough someone participates in it,\n\n245\n00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.370\nthey are not going to wait.\n\n246\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.880\nThey need a solution as\nquickly as you can get it.\n\n247\n00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.010\nSo our scope is they can get it.\n\n248\n00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.680\nSo what they did in this case is those\npeople said we don't need it anymore.\n\n249\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.630\nWe figured out how to deal with it.\n\n250\n00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.820\nThey worked around the system.\n\n251\n00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.180\nThey worked around the technology in ways\nthat it didn't need to be worked around\n\n252\n00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.290\nbecause they had a problem,\nthey can't get a look at backlog.\n\n253\n00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.980\nThey got people they got to report to and\ntalk to, so they just went ahead and\n\n254\n00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.730\nfound another way to do it and\nworked around your system, and\n\n255\n00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.010\nyour system was very\nrapidly getting eroded.\n\n256\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.660\nI heard that that's the way\nthey started doing it, and\n\n257\n00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.800\nthey realized how long it was taking.\n\n258\n00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.440\nTry to do some stuff\nto make it get faster.\n\n259\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.560\nTry to get on the phone and call people\nto get it sped up and it never worked.\n\n260\n00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.690\nSo they eventually started\nsubmitting less and less and\n\n261\n00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.570\nless and less to it and\njust making the changes on their own.\n\n262\n00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.290\nSo now you have the situation\nwhere it's got worse.\n\n263\n00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.870\nYou've got changes that\nyou don't have documented,\n\n264\n00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.650\ndon't have record and\nyou've lost control of it.\n\n265\n00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:14.960\n>> So what does the organization do?\n\n266\n00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.800\nI will think either have a,\nmaybe an emergency type change management,\n\n267\n00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.330\nthat's got a much shorter process.\n\n268\n00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.150\nAnd should these people be able to\nfind a work around at the first place?\n\n269\n00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.672\n>> Well, I found that human\nbeings are pretty creative.\n\n270\n00:15:29.672 --> 00:15:32.780\n[LAUGH] They'll find a workaround\nwhether you like it or not.\n\n271\n00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.350\nSo they'll find that, but\nas far as the change management process.\n\n272\n00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:43.880\nFirst of all emergency change management\nprocess aside Something like this,\n\n273\n00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.960\ntwo to three months to even come back and\nsay yeah your change has been approved.\n\n274\n00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.535\nThat's glacial speeds.\n\n275\n00:15:49.535 --> 00:15:52.723\n[LAUGH] That's just ridiculous to do that.\n\n276\n00:15:52.723 --> 00:15:56.408\nYou should not have someone waiting on\nanything as dynamic as technology wait\n\n277\n00:15:56.408 --> 00:15:57.530\nthat long to respond.\n\n278\n00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:58.383\nThat's a joke.\n\n279\n00:15:58.383 --> 00:16:01.914\nIf you tell me you've\ndealt with those before.\n\n280\n00:16:01.914 --> 00:16:03.930\nI hope it's not the technology field.\n\n281\n00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.010\nTechnology moves too fast to have.\n\n282\n00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:11.960\nAnd definitely security is way faster\nthan that you can't wait that long.\n\n283\n00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.350\nYou're tempting fate big time to do that.\n\n284\n00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.400\nSo that process should not take that long.\n\n285\n00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.330\nThat process should take\nfar less than that.\n\n286\n00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.820\nI'd say if you want to tell me\na couple weeks or a week or something.\n\n287\n00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.080\nThat's more reasonable.\n\n288\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.920\nA week I think is even not that bad.\n\n289\n00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.480\nI mean come on they're\nemailing stuff back and forth.\n\n290\n00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.550\nHow long does it take for\nme to send an email out to someone and\n\n291\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.900\nthat go to someone, or\n\n292\n00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.890\nto that can quickly review it, and\nthen that can go up to, if it's approved,\n\n293\n00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.780\ngo to a committee, an email to that\ncommittee and say hey, guess what?\n\n294\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.260\nOr you go, can you guys look at this?\n\n295\n00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.180\nAnd they just click a couple buttons.\n\n296\n00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.130\nYeah, it looks good.\n\n297\n00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:48.970\nAnd set it off.\n\n298\n00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.590\nYou're doing something else and\nI don't wanna hear any excuses like oh,\n\n299\n00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:52.900\nI've got a lot of other work to do.\n\n300\n00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.740\nWell, you're not doing\nthat either apparently.\n\n301\n00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.860\nSo I could pretty much guess that one so\n\n302\n00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.305\nyou can see I've got little tolerance for\nsome BS.\n\n303\n00:17:00.305 --> 00:17:02.040\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So it shouldn't take that long.\n\n304\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.230\nThat's encouraging.\n\n305\n00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.870\nWorkarounds.\n\n306\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.560\nPeople probably would wait a week or\ntwo but\n\n307\n00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.890\nthey're not gonna wait 2 or\n3 months just to get you to say\n\n308\n00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.670\nyeah it's okay go ahead you can continue\non but there's another process you got to\n\n309\n00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.830\ngo through to get someone to make the\nchange because you can't make the change.\n\n310\n00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:17.900\nYou know that's ridiculous.\n\n311\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.020\n>> Roberto out there in the [INAUDIBLE]\nroom has a good question.\n\n312\n00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.820\nIn a small organization\na lot times we find we have\n\n313\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.800\na more informal change management process.\n\n314\n00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.710\nWhere we just, there's only two of us,\nso we talk to each other.\n\n315\n00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.570\nWe decide, yep that's a good idea.\n\n316\n00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.430\nMaybe we write it down, maybe we document\nit, but it's not quite as formal.\n\n317\n00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.360\nMoving into a larger organization.\n\n318\n00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.330\nWhere they do have a very formal\nchange management process.\n\n319\n00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.220\nThat can be a tough transition.\n\n320\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.080\nAny way to ease that?\n\n321\n00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.120\nOr do you just have to bite the bullet and\nget used to it?\n\n322\n00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.610\n>> To go from a smaller to a larger?\n\n323\n00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.110\n>> Yeah just to start getting used to that\nformal change management that you didn't\n\n324\n00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.000\nhave to do before.\n\n325\n00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.930\n>> Well you definitely want to.\n\n326\n00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.210\nI have found for myself and\nmaybe I've been lucky that way.\n\n327\n00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:04.090\nI've found that,\nit's not a case of you just tell people\n\n328\n00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.990\nthis is a new system and\nyou'll like it or you'll like it.\n\n329\n00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.860\nThat's it.\n\n330\n00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.490\nThat's kind of the options\nthat you give them.\n\n331\n00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.690\nThat's not gonna fly,\nbut I found that if you\n\n332\n00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:18.570\ntell them that this is the reason you're\nchanging, the motivations behind it.\n\n333\n00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.550\nThey still may not like the reasoning,\nbut they're\n\n334\n00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:27.580\nmuch more likely to use the system because\nthe understand the motivations behind it.\n\n335\n00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.960\nAnd it also gives them time,\n\n336\n00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.200\nif you talk about it,\nit gives them time to give their input.\n\n337\n00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.370\nNo one wants to be in\na situation where they're.\n\n338\n00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:40.940\nThat new process is inflicted on them\nis the way they're gonna look at it and\n\n339\n00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.380\nthey have no say.\n\n340\n00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.240\nThey at least wanna be\nable to comment on it.\n\n341\n00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.960\nAnd so I figure in the situations\nI've been in, I've seen it\n\n342\n00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:55.000\nwhere people are just gonna use that\nmeeting to vent or give input to it.\n\n343\n00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.420\nAnd even if the input ultimately\ndoesn't get listened to,\n\n344\n00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.570\nat least they got to comment on it.\n\n345\n00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.160\nAnd they got to, you know, to put their.\n\n346\n00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:08.437\nI just saw that implications\nof that I saw that\n\n347\n00:19:08.437 --> 00:19:14.720\nrecently with one of the things\nwell it's for the military.\n\n348\n00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:21.530\nIt as logging hours and stuff like\nthat on a project we're working on.\n\n349\n00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.660\nWell they changed the way\ntime was logged and\n\n350\n00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:30.150\nbrought in a new form which granted,\nwas kinda stupid.\n\n351\n00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.090\nYou know what,\nI want a copy of this when we're done\n\n352\n00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.865\nbecause I want this played\non a loop back at command.\n\n353\n00:19:36.865 --> 00:19:38.200\n[LAUGH] But they put the,\n\n354\n00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.750\nyeah, I'll poke a grizzly bear\nwith not even a short stick.\n\n355\n00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.574\nI'll just go right up to them and\ndo that right there.\n\n356\n00:19:44.574 --> 00:19:47.875\nYes.\nSo, that's the angry one.\n\n357\n00:19:47.875 --> 00:19:48.460\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Or\n\n358\n00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.990\nit's the Atlanta Braves, I don't know.\n\n359\n00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.230\nBut, the process I saw in place,\n\n360\n00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.330\nthey put a new form in place to say\nthis is how time's going to be changing.\n\n361\n00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.500\nGranted, I looked at it, I would agree\nwith just about everyone in that room.\n\n362\n00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.510\nIt was, kind of dumb,\nI don't know who was doing it.\n\n363\n00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:07.360\nI think someone made a change for the sake\nof making change, which is never good.\n\n364\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.890\nAnd it was just a really\nkind of clunky way.\n\n365\n00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:15.740\nIf it takes you to tell someone how to log\ntime and this is the problem you have.\n\n366\n00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.690\nAnd to tell someone to log how much\ntime you were doing something.\n\n367\n00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.330\nIf it takes you to tell them hey, write\ndown when you started, when you ended.\n\n368\n00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.880\nIf it takes anymore than like\nwhat I just said right there.\n\n369\n00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.610\nIf it takes you 3 hours to explain how\nfill out how to count your minutes up,\n\n370\n00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.900\nthen you've got something that's\ntoo complicated and messy.\n\n371\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:39.500\nAnd they didn't pay any attention to him,\njust implemented it out there, and did it.\n\n372\n00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.220\nAnd when they had all these officers, and\n\n373\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.250\nother people in the room, everyone was\njust going off going, that's dumb.\n\n374\n00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.780\nShould go back to the old way.\n\n375\n00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.860\nEven though the person, the highest\nranking person for the command said,\n\n376\n00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.590\nwell we're not going back to the old way.\n\n377\n00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.460\nThis is the way it's gonna be.\n\n378\n00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.870\nEveryone heard him say that loud and\nclear.\n\n379\n00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.930\nPeople still kept going through,\nbut this and this and this.\n\n380\n00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:58.920\nPeople are using it now.\n\n381\n00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.480\nThey may still grumble about it, but hey,\n\n382\n00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.480\nyou let people speak their mind, you\nlisten to them and they took some things\n\n383\n00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.940\ninto account but didn't overall\nchange anything significantly.\n\n384\n00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.590\nIt's still the form that it was,\nthe stupid form that it was.\n\n385\n00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.190\n>> So Roberto, hope you at least\nhave somewhere you can vent\n\n386\n00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:23.450\nto get rid of some of those frustrations,\nbut other than that, you're probably.\n\n387\n00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.210\n>> If people feel like they're being\nlistened to, I guess, like I said,\n\n388\n00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.100\npeople feel like they are being.\n\n389\n00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.190\nIf they feel like they can at\nleast hear what's going on,\n\n390\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.150\nhear the motivations they have,\nthey're more likely to do it,\n\n391\n00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.280\ninstead of just having it\nshoved down their throat.\n\n392\n00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.040\nEveryone has that question, why?\n\n393\n00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.660\nSomething happened.\n\n394\n00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:40.620\nWhy?\n\n395\n00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.950\nThis is why.\n\n396\n00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.100\nYeah okay that's stupid.\n\n397\n00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.210\nThey'll grumble about it but\nthey'll more likely accept it.\n\n398\n00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.090\nAnd so I've always advocated doing that.\n\n399\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.660\nI don't have to take any of your advice.\n\n400\n00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.100\nI mean if you're telling me this stuff\nI can say oh that's very cute but\n\n401\n00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.110\nI'm not doing it.\n\n402\n00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:01.160\nI can sit there or I can say, that's\na good point, there's been an account for\n\n403\n00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.860\nthat but we can't do it for this reason.\n\n404\n00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.885\nFor some might be happy about it but\nat least they got their say.\n\n405\n00:22:07.885 --> 00:22:11.360\nBut ultimately you're gonna there's still\ngonna be a pupil out there who says,\n\n406\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.250\nwhat the heck with you\na lot doing at that way.\n\n407\n00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:18.160\nThen that's where the more serious side\ncomes, it's like, you aren't doing at this\n\n408\n00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.820\nway or you're not at the department or\nyou're not at this company anymore.\n\n409\n00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:27.830\nAll right, well today, Sean, a lot of good\ninformation on how we go about validating\n\n410\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.830\nsystem designs, change management\nbeing a big part of that.\n\n411\n00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.810\nAnything else you wanna\nadd to this episode.\n\n412\n00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:40.790\n>> Just a quick thing in the end, cuz\nwe've said it throughout the course is.\n\n413\n00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.830\n>> That human element is that one that's\nprobably the toughest to deal with and\n\n414\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:46.610\nyou can see in the change,\n\n415\n00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.860\nimagine what I said here at the end as\nfar as letting people have their say.\n\n416\n00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:55.320\nYou can call it a venting\nparty if you want or whatever.\n\n417\n00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:01.480\nIf you do those sorts of things,\nit makes it better for you.\n\n418\n00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.310\nBut you're going to have\nto learn as a cast,\n\n419\n00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.230\nyou're going to have to deal with people.\n\n420\n00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.640\nAnd this is one of\nthe things that helps here.\n\n421\n00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.630\nIf you're going to implement a process\nof any sort, not just change management,\n\n422\n00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:14.310\nyou have to deal with people, you have\nto understand how people do things.\n\n423\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.680\nThis is a very very good case of it.\n\n424\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.560\nLet them have their say,\nlet them do half to,\n\n425\n00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.190\nthat gets them more likely to follow it.\n\n426\n00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.160\nUnderstanding if you make\nsomething too complicated,\n\n427\n00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.510\nthey're not going to do things that way.\n\n428\n00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:32.090\nPeople are going to start to go around it\nin greater quantities, as that first and\n\n429\n00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.340\nsecond person and\nthird person start testing the water and\n\n430\n00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.520\nthey're successful at it,\nmore people are going to go around.\n\n431\n00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.830\nYou know that, and that happens in mass\nyou're going to lose control of something.\n\n432\n00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.960\nSo you got to learn people a CASP.\n\n433\n00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.470\nAnd then going up even above this\nto other levels of management and\n\n434\n00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.150\nupper management and all that stuff.\n\n435\n00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.720\nYou really got to learn\nhow the human element\n\n436\n00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.690\nworks because they can adversely impact.\n\n437\n00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:59.210\nThat security model you have can\nreally cause problems for you.\n\n438\n00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.420\nAll your best laid plans on one side\nthat sound good and look good and\n\n439\n00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.390\nwill work, could be affected by just\none person or a small group of people\n\n440\n00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.490\nnot being handled the right way,\ncould create a disgruntled employee,\n\n441\n00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:14.010\ncreate someone that's just gonna have the,\nto heck with you.\n\n442\n00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.570\nYou don't want that.\n\n443\n00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:20.240\nSo If there's anything, even outside this\ncourse, that I can encourage people to do,\n\n444\n00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:26.200\nit's to improve themselves and\nbe better at this level.\n\n445\n00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.040\nNot reading books, necessarily, on it,\n\n446\n00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.670\nbecause reading a book ain't gonna to\nteach you how to interact with people.\n\n447\n00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.350\nIt's doing more interaction,\nlearning how it is.\n\n448\n00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:39.373\nIt took me awhile to learn that, early\non in my career I figured my technical\n\n449\n00:24:39.373 --> 00:24:44.987\nability was way, I wasn't good with people\nand that hasn't changed, by the way.\n\n450\n00:24:44.987 --> 00:24:46.900\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I wasn't good with people.\n\n451\n00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.019\n>> You don't have to tell us, Shawn.\n\n452\n00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:49.882\n>> Yeah, everyone knows.\n\n453\n00:24:49.882 --> 00:24:52.256\nThat's why there's no one here anymore.\n\n454\n00:24:52.256 --> 00:25:00.210\nSo I accepted it a long time ago.\n\n455\n00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:00.975\nI accepted change.\n\n456\n00:25:00.975 --> 00:25:07.670\n[LAUGH] So\nI was relying on career my thing was\n\n457\n00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:14.220\nI knew I wasn't good with people so\nI overcompensated on my tech skills.\n\n458\n00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.920\nWhen I came in people were in this field.\n\n459\n00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.770\nI'm in here in my teens doing it and\n\n460\n00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.950\npeople said oh well\nthe guy's brilliant I heard\n\n461\n00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.850\na lot that oh yeah he's brilliant he's\na genius with technology and all that.\n\n462\n00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.055\nI never heard anybody say\nI was good with people.\n\n463\n00:25:28.055 --> 00:25:28.630\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n464\n00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:29.590\n>> I never heard that.\n\n465\n00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.010\nI just went way too far.\n\n466\n00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:35.380\nI always had my nose stuck in a book or\ntaking stuff apart or soldering or\n\n467\n00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.620\ndesoldering something whatever it was.\n\n468\n00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.280\nYou know which is helpful for\nlearning how to hack type stuff\n\n469\n00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.760\nbecause I was always doing something\nthat I wasn't supposed to be.\n\n470\n00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.260\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Yes, but I had to develop.\n\n471\n00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.140\nI was told by management early on.\n\n472\n00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.310\nYou have to develop those people skills.\n\n473\n00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.470\nAnd I always thought, I'm not a schmoozer.\n\n474\n00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:52.120\nI'm not that.\n\n475\n00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.830\nI don't like you know,\ndoing all that stuff.\n\n476\n00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:56.020\nBut I realize now.\n\n477\n00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.790\nThe value of doing that and\nit developed more on that side.\n\n478\n00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:04.400\nSo you will have to develop that as a casp\nand this is just a prime example of it.\n\n479\n00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.220\nSo, there you go.\n\n480\n00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.580\n>> Alright well ladies and gentlemen we\nhope you enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n481\n00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.750\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike
