Hello, my name is John Spence and I'd\nlike to take a few minutes to share with\n\n5\n00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:21.246\nyou what this course is about so\nyou can make a good decision about whether\n\n6\n00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:24.570\nit's right for you and\nwould be a good investment for you.\n\n7\n00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.560\nThis is my consultative sales course.\n\n8\n00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.010\nI've taught this class to many\ncompanies in the Fortune 100,\n\n9\n00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.110\neven some in the Fortune 10,\n\n10\n00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.870\nand also to hundreds of people from\nsmall to medium-sized companies.\n\n11\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.380\nIts three key ideas that\nyou want to know about it.\n\n12\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.121\nNumber one is this is a course built if\nyou want to be seen as a trusted advisor,\n\n13\n00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:51.851\na partner, a peer, a team member\nto your customer slash client.\n\n14\n00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:55.784\nAnd the people that usually take this\ncourse are either seasoned salespeople, or\n\n15\n00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:59.831\nfolks that have been selling already, that\nwant to hone their skills, get better,\n\n16\n00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:03.430\nbe much more of a consultant, and\nget closer to their customers.\n\n17\n00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.500\nAnd then there's a lot of people I've\ntaught this class to that have to interact\n\n18\n00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.942\nwith customers and clients and have to\nsell, but they don't really see themselves\n\n19\n00:01:11.942 --> 00:01:15.160\nas salespeople or don't want to\nsee themselves as salespeople.\n\n20\n00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.090\nAnd that's engineers, architects, people\nin the medical industry, things like that\n\n21\n00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.850\nwhere yes I have to talk to customers, but\nI don't want to be seen as a salesperson.\n\n22\n00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.260\nSo if either one of those matches you,\nsomeone who wants to get better as\n\n23\n00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.290\na consultative salesperson, or someone\nthat has to sell but doesn't really\n\n24\n00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.220\nwant to be a salesperson, this should\nbe an absolutely superb course for you.\n\n25\n00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.430\nThere's something else important\nto know about this course which is\n\n26\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.450\nI only focus on stuff that\nreally works in the real world.\n\n27\n00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.550\nI've been teaching this class for\nabout 20 years all over the world.\n\n28\n00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.350\nIn the early part of my career I worked\nwith mostly Fortune 100 companies,\n\n29\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.230\nhelping them close deals\nof $100 million or larger.\n\n30\n00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.749\nThe same ideas that work there work in the\nsmallest company with two or three people.\n\n31\n00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:00.479\nAnd again,\nmost of this is business to business, but\n\n32\n00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.990\nthere is some application\nto business to consumer.\n\n33\n00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.670\nAlso, I've owned my own companies for\n\n34\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.550\nseveral years, and\nI am the lead salesperson.\n\n35\n00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.650\nI'm out in the field too.\n\n36\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.240\nNot only have I learned this stuff and\nI taught it, but\n\n37\n00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.710\nI have to use it every\nweek to close deals.\n\n38\n00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.600\nWhat that means is no fluff,\nno silly stories, only things you can use\n\n39\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.170\nright away to have a dramatic positive\nimpact on your sales success.\n\n40\n00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.400\nSo if that sounds like it's\nwhat you're looking for,\n\n41\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.020\nI hope you'll invest in this course.\n\n42\n00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.840\nBut I do want to let you know that if for\n\n43\n00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.220\nany reason, you don't feel\nlike you got value out of it,\n\n44\n00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.890\nall you have to do is send us an email and\nwe will refund your money immediately.\n\n45\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.810\nSo I hope this helped you make a good\ndecision about whether this course is\n\n46\n00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.690\nright for you or not.\n\n47\n00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.720\nAgain, I'll tell you there's gonna be\nlots of great ideas, stuff that works.\n\n48\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.574\nI'm gonna overwhelm you\nwith great information, and\n\n49\n00:02:50.574 --> 00:02:53.984\nI hope you'll make a decision to\nspend a couple hours with me, and\n\n50\n00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:56.602\nlet me help you be a more\nsuccessful salesperson.\n\n",
