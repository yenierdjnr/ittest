Hello, my name is John Spence and I'd\nlike to take a few minutes to share with\n\n5\n00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:21.246\nyou what this course is about so\nyou can make a good decision about whether\n\n6\n00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:24.570\nit's right for you and\nwould be a good investment for you.\n\n7\n00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.560\nThis is my consultative sales course.\n\n8\n00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.010\nI've taught this class to many\ncompanies in the Fortune 100,\n\n9\n00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.110\neven some in the Fortune 10,\n\n10\n00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.870\nand also to hundreds of people from\nsmall to medium-sized companies.\n\n11\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.380\nIts three key ideas that\nyou want to know about it.\n\n12\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.121\nNumber one is this is a course built if\nyou want to be seen as a trusted advisor,\n\n13\n00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:51.851\na partner, a peer, a team member\nto your customer slash client.\n\n14\n00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:55.784\nAnd the people that usually take this\ncourse are either seasoned salespeople, or\n\n15\n00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:59.831\nfolks that have been selling already, that\nwant to hone their skills, get better,\n\n16\n00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:03.430\nbe much more of a consultant, and\nget closer to their customers.\n\n17\n00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.500\nAnd then there's a lot of people I've\ntaught this class to that have to interact\n\n18\n00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.942\nwith customers and clients and have to\nsell, but they don't really see themselves\n\n19\n00:01:11.942 --> 00:01:15.160\nas salespeople or don't want to\nsee themselves as salespeople.\n\n20\n00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.090\nAnd that's engineers, architects, people\nin the medical industry, things like that\n\n21\n00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.850\nwhere yes I have to talk to customers, but\nI don't want to be seen as a salesperson.\n\n22\n00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.260\nSo if either one of those matches you,\nsomeone who wants to get better as\n\n23\n00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.290\na consultative salesperson, or someone\nthat has to sell but doesn't really\n\n24\n00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.220\nwant to be a salesperson, this should\nbe an absolutely superb course for you.\n\n25\n00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.430\nThere's something else important\nto know about this course which is\n\n26\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.450\nI only focus on stuff that\nreally works in the real world.\n\n27\n00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.550\nI've been teaching this class for\nabout 20 years all over the world.\n\n28\n00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.350\nIn the early part of my career I worked\nwith mostly Fortune 100 companies,\n\n29\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.230\nhelping them close deals\nof $100 million or larger.\n\n30\n00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.749\nThe same ideas that work there work in the\nsmallest company with two or three people.\n\n31\n00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:00.479\nAnd again,\nmost of this is business to business, but\n\n32\n00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.990\nthere is some application\nto business to consumer.\n\n33\n00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.670\nAlso, I've owned my own companies for\n\n34\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.550\nseveral years, and\nI am the lead salesperson.\n\n35\n00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.650\nI'm out in the field too.\n\n36\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.240\nNot only have I learned this stuff and\nI taught it, but\n\n37\n00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.710\nI have to use it every\nweek to close deals.\n\n38\n00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.600\nWhat that means is no fluff,\nno silly stories, only things you can use\n\n39\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.170\nright away to have a dramatic positive\nimpact on your sales success.\n\n40\n00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.400\nSo if that sounds like it's\nwhat you're looking for,\n\n41\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.020\nI hope you'll invest in this course.\n\n42\n00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.840\nBut I do want to let you know that if for\n\n43\n00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.220\nany reason, you don't feel\nlike you got value out of it,\n\n44\n00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.890\nall you have to do is send us an email and\nwe will refund your money immediately.\n\n45\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.810\nSo I hope this helped you make a good\ndecision about whether this course is\n\n46\n00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.690\nright for you or not.\n\n47\n00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.720\nAgain, I'll tell you there's gonna be\nlots of great ideas, stuff that works.\n\n48\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.574\nI'm gonna overwhelm you\nwith great information, and\n\n49\n00:02:50.574 --> 00:02:53.984\nI hope you'll make a decision to\nspend a couple hours with me, and\n\n50\n00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:56.602\nlet me help you be a more\nsuccessful salesperson.\n\n",

mindset.\n\n3\n00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.350\nYou don't wanna think of\nyourself as a sales person.\n\n4\n00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.420\nYou wanna think of\nyourself as a consultant.\n\n5\n00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.520\nYou wanna be insanely curious,\nask great questions.\n\n6\n00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.010\nTreat your client,\ncustomer with tremendous respect.\n\n7\n00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.250\nBe very professional.\n\n8\n00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.250\nActually, let me help you out with this.\n\n9\n00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.760\nOften times when I teach this course,\nI'll ask the audience,\n\n10\n00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.620\nwhat do you think of when you\nthink of the typical salesperson?\n\n11\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.610\nAnd here's the sort of things I hear.\n\n12\n00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.720\nThey talk too much.\n\n13\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.610\nThey're aggressive.\n\n14\n00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.710\nThey're rude.\n\n15\n00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.340\nThey don't know anything about me.\n\n16\n00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.690\nIf it's a business to business thing,\n\n17\n00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.060\nit's they don't know anything\nabout my business or my customers.\n\n18\n00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.950\nThey're constantly talking\nabout their product.\n\n19\n00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.630\nThey only care about their commission.\n\n20\n00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.780\nAnd the biggest thing, and\n\n21\n00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.600\nit's the one that I hear from the most\nsenior executives, is the reason\n\n22\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.790\nI won't see a salesperson or talk to\na salesperson is they waste my time.\n\n23\n00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.040\nI could almost end the course right here,\nbut I won't,\n\n24\n00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.600\nbecause there's a lot of other\nstuff I gotta teach you.\n\n25\n00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.330\nBut if you truly want to\nbe a great salesperson,\n\n26\n00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.820\njust do the reverse of all that stuff.\n\n27\n00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.970\nBe extremely professional.\n\n28\n00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.220\nSee sales as a craft, as a noble craft.\n\n29\n00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.010\nDo only what's in your\nclient's best interest.\n\n30\n00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.230\nAsk lots of questions.\n\n31\n00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.990\nWrite great notes.\n\n32\n00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.794\nListen intently.\n\n33\n00:01:23.794 --> 00:01:26.806\nOnly focus on what they need,\nwhat's important to them,\n\n34\n00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:29.230\ngetting them the exact right solution.\n\n35\n00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.320\nDon't worry about your commission.\n\n36\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.250\nYou're gonna be fine.\n\n37\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.450\nTreat them as a partner, as a peer.\n\n38\n00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.230\nBe extremely well-prepared.\n\n39\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.030\nHave an agenda.\n\n40\n00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.940\nDo all the things that position\nyou as a true trusted advisor,\n\n41\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.490\nas a consultant, a friend,\na peer, a partner, and\n\n42\n00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.100\nmost importantly is,\ndon't waste a single minute of their time.\n\n43\n00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.060\nMake sure that you're there,\ntotally focused on them,\n\n44\n00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.940\ndoing everything you can to help them,\nextremely prepared, ready to\n\n45\n00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.670\nmake sure that you're meeting with them is\na great, great investment of their time.\n\n46\n00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.050\nAnd you're gonna help them find\na perfect solution for their problem.\n\n47\n00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.180\nIf you really wanna be a consultant or\na salesperson, that's the first step.\n\n48\n00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.810\nSo when we look at what it\ntakes to be a trusted advisor,\n\n49\n00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.820\nthere's a pyramid I use to describe this.\n\n50\n00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.050\nAt the base of the pyramid is\njust general business knowledge.\n\n51\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.680\nYou gotta know what's going on in\nyour town, in the economy, globally.\n\n52\n00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.520\nIt doesn't mean you need\nto know everything, but\n\n53\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.710\nyou need to keep up with stuff.\n\n54\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.890\nSo this is reading the Wall Street\nJournal, reading your local paper,\n\n55\n00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.190\nmaybe watching a little bit of news,\nnot too much, it'll depress you.\n\n56\n00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.300\nBut just keeping up on the general trends,\n\n57\n00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.265\nthe general economy, what's happening in\nbusiness, so that at least you can speak\n\n58\n00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:46.095\nknowledgeably about what's happening\nin the general business arena.\n\n59\n00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:50.245\nThe next level, and this is critical,\nis you must be an expert, and\n\n60\n00:02:50.245 --> 00:02:51.825\nI do not use that work lightly.\n\n61\n00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:55.560\nI mean an expert on your products and\nservices.\n\n62\n00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.490\nYou've got to know that stuff\n95% dead down pat perfect.\n\n63\n00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.980\nYour allowed every now and then to say I\ndon't know let me go check with my office,\n\n64\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.750\nlet me talk to one of the engineers.\n\n65\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.320\nLet me call back and see,\nthat's okay a few times.\n\n66\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.650\nBut the vast majority of\nthe time you need to be a true\n\n67\n00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.650\nexpert about everything you sell,\nabout your products, about your services,\n\n68\n00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.060\nabout the warranty, about the pricing.\n\n69\n00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.230\nEverything you can think\nof that is table stakes.\n\n70\n00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.310\nIf you don't know your products and\nservices inside and\n\n71\n00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.690\nout there is no way on the face of the\nearth a customer/client will trust you.\n\n72\n00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.460\nThe next step, and\nthis is an interesting one,\n\n73\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.380\nis you need to be an expert\non your competition.\n\n74\n00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.190\nReally understand your entire industry,\nunderstand who you compete against,\n\n75\n00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.370\nwhat's going on in your industry,\nwho's making changes,\n\n76\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.460\nwho has new innovations, and\nI'm even going to go one step further.\n\n77\n00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.260\nYou should know your competition\nwell enough, their products,\n\n78\n00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.590\ntheir services, all of them, that you\ncan make referrals to your clients and\n\n79\n00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.080\ncustomers if you don't have the right\nproduct or service for them.\n\n80\n00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.380\nIf you can't give them the exact right\nsolution, something that will truly\n\n81\n00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.410\nsolve their problem and help them, then\nif you want to be a trusted advisor and\n\n82\n00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.570\na great constitutive sales person, you\nwill refer them off to your competition.\n\n83\n00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.835\nAnd you should know your competition\nwell enough that you understand that\n\n84\n00:04:15.835 --> 00:04:19.155\nthey have the products or\nservices that will solve their problem.\n\n85\n00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:21.815\nSo in addition to being an expert\non your company, your products,\n\n86\n00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:27.105\nyour services, you need to be an expert on\nyour industry and your major competition.\n\n87\n00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:32.040\nLast but most important, you must\nbecome an expert on your customer.\n\n88\n00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.020\nIf it's a B to B situation, you need\nto understand their business very well.\n\n89\n00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.970\nWho do they sell to?\n\n90\n00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.580\nHow do they make money?\n\n91\n00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.050\nWhat are their unique processes?\n\n92\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.170\nWhat's differentiated about their product?\n\n93\n00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.210\nHow are they positioned\nin the market place?\n\n94\n00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.810\nEverything you can possibly understand.\n\n95\n00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.030\nAnd for\na lot of people this feels awkward,\n\n96\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.680\nlike how am I gonna find\nout all these information.\n\n97\n00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.380\nJust remember that as a trusted advisor\nif you're truly a partner to them,\n\n98\n00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.060\nyou have the right and\nthe obligation to know as\n\n99\n00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.055\nmuch as you possibly can about their\nbusiness so you can help their business.\n\n100\n00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:08.735\nAnd if you've got someone who's not\nwilling to share that information with\n\n101\n00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:12.405\nyou, they have told you that\nsee you as a vendor [LAUGH] and\n\n102\n00:05:12.405 --> 00:05:14.885\nthey're probably gonna\nbeat you up on price.\n\n103\n00:05:14.885 --> 00:05:19.415\nSo you've got to become as much as\npossible an expert on you customer.\n\n104\n00:05:19.415 --> 00:05:22.825\nDo your homework, go to their website,\nread their industry journals,\n\n105\n00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:24.960\nfind out everything you can about them.\n\n106\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.130\nAnd if this is a business\nto consumers sale,\n\n107\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.860\nyou need to find out as much as they\nwill share with you about them.\n\n108\n00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.010\nWhat's their family situation, if you\nneed to know, let's give you an example.\n\n109\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.576\nI've worked for a lot of boat companies.\n\n110\n00:05:38.576 --> 00:05:42.405\nAnd I work for one of the top\nski boat companies in the world,\n\n111\n00:05:42.405 --> 00:05:45.750\nMasterCraft, and\nI've been helping their sales people.\n\n112\n00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.090\nAnd some of the things you need to know\nare, what's their family situation?\n\n113\n00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.590\nHow many kids do they have?\n\n114\n00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.660\nHow old are their kids?\n\n115\n00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.500\nDo their kids already like to ski?\n\n116\n00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.780\nDoes their husband or wife like to ski?\n\n117\n00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.130\nHave they owned other boats?\n\n118\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.750\nAre they a knowledgeable boat owner?\n\n119\n00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.500\nIt would even help to know\nwhat kind of car they drive,\n\n120\n00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.800\nwhere they go on vacation,\nwhat kind of sports they like.\n\n121\n00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.210\nBecause that will help you\nunderstand the customer better and\n\n122\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.330\nbe able to position them and put them in\nthe right boat that is exactly right for\n\n123\n00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.530\nthem and their family.\n\n124\n00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.790\nSo the more you know about the customer\nand everything about them,\n\n125\n00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.460\nthe better job you can do of helping\nthem buy what's exactly right for them.\n\n126\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.580\nYou notice I didn't say sell them,\nhelping them purchase exactly what they\n\n127\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.190\nwant to solve their problems or to have\nmore fun on the water or to make their\n\n128\n00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.640\nfamily happy or whatever it might be as\nit pertains to your product and service.\n\n129\n00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.270\nHere's something you need to understand.\n\n130\n00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.420\nThe first two levels, having general\nbusiness knowledge and being a true\n\n131\n00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.250\nexpert on your products and services,\nbasically gets you no extra credit at all.\n\n132\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.940\nThat's expected.\n\n133\n00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.800\nIf you're gonna sell something to me, you\nought to know at least those two things.\n\n134\n00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.010\nSo that's of little or no value.\n\n135\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.480\nAt the next level, understanding your\ncompetition and being an expert on your\n\n136\n00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.820\nindustry and your competition, now you're\nstarting to add a medium level of value.\n\n137\n00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.690\nBecause not every sales person does that.\n\n138\n00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.950\nMatter of fact, few sales people do that.\n\n139\n00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:11.080\nBut when you jump to that top level of\ntruly becoming an expert on your customer,\n\n140\n00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.120\nnow you're adding massive value.\n\n141\n00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.520\nNow you're positioning\nyourself as a trusted advisor,\n\n142\n00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.430\nsomeone that they wanna partner with,\nsomeone they want on their team.\n\n143\n00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.360\nAnd the reason is when you get to that\nlevel, you're not just answering requests,\n\n144\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.690\nyou're not just,\nthey say they have a problem you solve it.\n\n145\n00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.570\nYou're actually proactively\nthinking of problems\n\n146\n00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.410\nthat they don't even know that they have.\n\n147\n00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.370\nYou're coming up with solutions that\nare better than they thought they could\n\n148\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:35.960\ncome up with.\n\n149\n00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.700\nYou are adding massive value because\nbasically you are able to see\n\n150\n00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.920\naround the corner.\n\n151\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.410\nYou know as much about their business\nas some of the people there,\n\n152\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.840\nyou know a lot about their industry and\nthen you know about your products and\n\n153\n00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.430\nservices and\nall the ways you can help them.\n\n154\n00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.382\nAnd this is another way where\nyou do cross selling and\n\n155\n00:07:52.382 --> 00:07:56.877\nyou increase your share of wallet by not\njust selling of one solution but helping\n\n156\n00:07:56.877 --> 00:08:01.169\nthem purchase multiple solutions or\ncome back and purchase from you over and\n\n157\n00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:04.756\nover again because you add so\nmuch value, they get so much ROI.\n\n158\n00:08:04.756 --> 00:08:09.244\nOr if it's an individual purchase, they\nreally enjoy the shopping, buying, and\n\n159\n00:08:09.244 --> 00:08:12.065\nowning experience of your products and\nservices and\n\n160\n00:08:12.065 --> 00:08:14.460\nthey want to do more business with you.\n\n161\n00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.090\nAnd they become a customer evangelist,\nsomeone that sends you referrals.\n\n162\n00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.760\nAt the very top of this pyramid,\nwhen you're a consultative,\n\n163\n00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.600\ntrusted advisor, you have a lot of value.\n\n164\n00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.310\nAnd it's very hard to get you out\nof there because they trust you,\n\n165\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.000\nthe switching cost is high.\n\n166\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.840\nAnd you have differentiated yourself\nas a sales person dramatically\n\n167\n00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.480\nfrom your competition.\n\n168\n00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.450\nAnd they really trust you which\nmeans it's easier to make the sale.\n\n169\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.040\nThey don't argue about prices much.\n\n170\n00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.110\nAnd if they get the ROI they want,\neither personal or business, they're\n\n171\n00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.680\ngoing to continue to do lots of business\nwith you and that's what we're all after.\n\n172\n00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.800\nSo far I've already talked a lot\nabout trust, being a trusted advisor.\n\n173\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.450\nSo I want to share with you a matrix our\nfirm created around how to create trust.\n\n174\n00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.990\nAnd we call this the four Cs of trust,\nand I might add a fifth here for today.\n\n175\n00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.250\nBut the four Cs of trust are,\n\n176\n00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:11.430\nyou must Consistently Communicate\nthat you are Competent and you Care.\n\n177\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.029\nHere's the matrix right here, and\nin the far bottom-right corner,\n\n178\n00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:18.360\nyou've got someone with high\ncompetence but low concern.\n\n179\n00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.430\nThey're brilliant, I mean they're genius,\nthey know their products and services,\n\n180\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.265\nthey know their industry,\nthey know everything, but they're an ass.\n\n181\n00:09:24.265 --> 00:09:26.960\n[LAUGH] Do you trust this person?\n\n182\n00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.397\nNo, nobody trusts this kinda person\nbecause they're rude, arrogant,\n\n183\n00:09:30.397 --> 00:09:31.440\ncondescending.\n\n184\n00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.196\nThe word I use here is respect.\n\n185\n00:09:33.196 --> 00:09:36.740\nI respect their competence,\nI respect their intelligence.\n\n186\n00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.540\nBut I do not trust them cuz I\nknow they don't care about me.\n\n187\n00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.110\nThey only care about themselves and\nshowing off how smart, bright, and\n\n188\n00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.180\ntalented they are.\n\n189\n00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.850\nI'm glad they're competent but\n\n190\n00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.440\nI don't want to do business with them\nbecause I don't deeply trust them.\n\n191\n00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.482\nThe next one in the lower left-hand corner\nis I'm incompetent and I don't care.\n\n192\n00:09:54.482 --> 00:09:58.595\nYeah, I'm rude, aggressive, nasty, and\nI have no idea what I'm talking about.\n\n193\n00:09:58.595 --> 00:10:02.940\n[LAUGH] It does not work in sales at all.\n\n194\n00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.650\nThis is distrust.\n\n195\n00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:09.480\nAnd no one will be successful in any\nkind of business with low competence and\n\n196\n00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.010\nlow concern.\n\n197\n00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.910\nOkay now in the upper left-hand corner\nwe've got someone with high concern but\n\n198\n00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.260\nlow competence.\n\n199\n00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.020\nAnd unfortunately I see\nthis in sales a lot.\n\n200\n00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.580\nThis is somebody who's really nice.\n\n201\n00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.470\nThey swing by and bring you donuts or\ninvite you out to play golf or\n\n202\n00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.190\ntake you out to dinner.\n\n203\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.080\nBut they're hoping that\nthe relationship and\n\n204\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.520\nthe relationship only will\nsell the product or service.\n\n205\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.580\nAnd that happens very,\n\n206\n00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.050\nvery rarely will people give you\nbusiness just cuz they like you.\n\n207\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:42.180\nBut if you want to have continued business\nand get word of mouth referrals and\n\n208\n00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.040\ngrow the business and be a true\nconsultative sales person at the highest\n\n209\n00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.680\nlevel, affection alone won't help you and\nthat's what I call this level, affection.\n\n210\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.900\nThis is somebody who's really friendly,\nI love hanging out with them.\n\n211\n00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.810\nThey're great but when I ask them\nabout their product, they don't know,\n\n212\n00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.460\nthey can't answer.\n\n213\n00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.780\nWhen I ask them about the competitive\nproduct, they don't know.\n\n214\n00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.720\nThey know very little about my business,\nthey're not asking a lot of questions.\n\n215\n00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.770\nAgain, I like them but\n\n216\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.430\nI don't trust them because I don't feel\nthat they're competent enough to help me.\n\n217\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.920\nAnd to play a major role in my business.\n\n218\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.600\nNow the last quadrant at\nthe very top right hand is trust.\n\n219\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.820\nAnd this is someone with high\ncompetence and high concern.\n\n220\n00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.880\nHigh competence, high concern and\nthe fifth C I'm gonna add is character.\n\n221\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.630\nI would say that goes\nalong with competence, but\n\n222\n00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.130\none of the folks in my classes\npointed that out lately, and\n\n223\n00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:33.900\nI thought it was nice, so high competence,\nhigh concern, high character.\n\n224\n00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.150\nThis is someone who is extremely\nknowledgeable, very talent,\n\n225\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.820\na true expert on their products, their\nservices, their industry, the competition,\n\n226\n00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.560\nand their customers' business and\nthey're also very friendly.\n\n227\n00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.920\nThey have a high connection.\n\n228\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.450\nSo basically I can wrap this\nwhole idea up into this.\n\n229\n00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:57.000\nWhat a true consultative person\ndoes by consistently communicating\n\n230\n00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.740\nthat they're competent in their\ncare is say to the customer/client,\n\n231\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.325\nI'm good at what I do and\nI do it because I care about you.\n\n232\n00:12:04.325 --> 00:12:06.690\nThat's a really big idea.\n\n233\n00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:11.060\nI teach this in leadership as well but\nif you want to build a high level of trust\n\n234\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.300\nyou have to consistently communicate\nthat you're competent, you care.\n\n235\n00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.570\nAnd show all of your customers I'm good\nat what I do, getting better every day,\n\n236\n00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:23.163\nI'm studying, I'm learning, I'm always\nbringing new ideas, new innovations,\n\n237\n00:12:23.163 --> 00:12:27.090\nnew suggestions, I'm really good at\nwhat I do and I do it all for you.\n\n238\n00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.390\nI always have your best\ninterests at heart.\n\n239\n00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.720\nI will never sell you anything\nthat isn't exactly right for you.\n\n240\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.780\nYou can trust me.\n\n241\n00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.190\nI'm on your team.\n\n242\n00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.110\nThat is how you build trust.\n\n243\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.480\nInteresting point here,\nit can take weeks, months, or\n\n244\n00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.540\nyears to build up that level of trust and\nnanoseconds to lose it.\n\n245\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.680\nSo you gotta really guard\nthat reputation and\n\n246\n00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.360\nyou've got to be consistently learning,\ngrowing, getting better, and\n\n247\n00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.680\nprove everyday that you're always doing it\nbecause you want to serve your customers,\n\n248\n00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.700\nhelp them, and\nalways do what is in their best interest.\n\n249\n00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.570\nNow I'm gonna teach you a very simple\nidea but one that has huge ramifications.\n\n250\n00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.730\nAnd here's the idea, and I learned this\nfrom Mahan Kalsa who wrote an excellent\n\n251\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.700\nbook, I highly recommend it,\ncalled Let's Get Real or Let's Not Play.\n\n252\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:19.490\nOne out of hundreds of sales book I've\nread, absolutely in my top two or three.\n\n253\n00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:23.330\nAnd I'm gonna talk about the other one\nwhich is in the top two or three again.\n\n254\n00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.220\nBut here's the idea, listen carefully.\n\n255\n00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.980\nTechnique is nothing,\nintent is everything.\n\n256\n00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.660\nIn other words,\n\n257\n00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.450\nyou could go to some of the sales training\nplaces that teach you all the techniques,\n\n258\n00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:42.210\nthe tie-downs, the porcupine close, the\nBen Franklin close, the puppy dog close.\n\n259\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:46.860\nHow to sort of ask manipulative questions\nthat force people to say, yes, yes,\n\n260\n00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.930\nyes, and\nall these things that are techniques.\n\n261\n00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.720\nBut the truth of the matter is, most\ncustomers see through that pretty quickly\n\n262\n00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.230\nand if they catch you doing that,\nyou've automatically destroyed your trust\n\n263\n00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.240\ncuz they realized it's a technique,\nyou're trying to manipulate them.\n\n264\n00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.440\nThe other side of the coin is if\nyour intent is to truly help them,\n\n265\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.230\nlet them get the exact right solution at a\ngood price that's reasonable and fair and\n\n266\n00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:15.040\na good profit for you, and they know that\nyour intent is to truly help them, you can\n\n267\n00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.150\nactually mess up a lot of stuff and\nthey'll give you the benefit of the doubt.\n\n268\n00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:23.529\nIf you're not the most polished\nsalespeople in the world, and you don't\n\n269\n00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:28.473\nrun the best meeting but they know you're\nreally, really, really trying hard and\n\n270\n00:14:28.473 --> 00:14:33.153\nyour intent is to help them as much as\nyou can, they'll overlook a lot of that.\n\n271\n00:14:33.153 --> 00:14:37.488\nNow, if you have,\nyou don't use the slimy techniques and\n\n272\n00:14:37.488 --> 00:14:43.800\nyou're also competent with great intent,\nthat is a winning combination.\n\n273\n00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.210\nYou show up and\nyou're not trying all these stupid closes,\n\n274\n00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.310\nyou're not trying to pressure them or\nmanipulate them.\n\n275\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.635\nYou're not trying for the aggressive\nclose right now, always be closing.\n\n276\n00:14:52.635 --> 00:14:59.170\n[LAUGH] But you are professional,\nyou are kind, you're honest.\n\n277\n00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.340\nYou give them time.\n\n278\n00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.820\nYou give information.\n\n279\n00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.560\nYou help them.\n\n280\n00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.580\nAnd you're extremely professional.\n\n281\n00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.040\nYou've got good questioning techniques.\n\n282\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.050\nYou've got good listening skills.\n\n283\n00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.730\nYou're taking great notes.\n\n284\n00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.660\nYou're asking the right kind of questions.\n\n285\n00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.920\nAnd they can see you're doing all of\nit because you want to help them.\n\n286\n00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.050\nYou've got positive technique plus\ngreat intent, that's the way to do it.\n\n287\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:27.000\nThis is another small\nidea with huge payback.\n\n288\n00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.620\nThis is actually one of the most\nimportant things I ever learned in sales.\n\n289\n00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.000\nWhen I figured this out it\ntotally changed the way\n\n290\n00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.110\nI looked at my relationship with my\ncustomers and clients and here's the idea.\n\n291\n00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:42.480\nIf you're truly gonna position yourself\nas a trusted adviser and a partner,\n\n292\n00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.960\nyou got to realize that your job there\nis to get the exact right solution for\n\n293\n00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.990\nyour customer.\n\n294\n00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.730\nAnd you've heard me used that\nterms several times because\n\n295\n00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.720\nthat's truly what you want.\n\n296\n00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.680\nI used to think it was sort of\na battle between me and the customer.\n\n297\n00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.430\nI was gonna try to get them there and\ntalk to them and convince them and\n\n298\n00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.060\nsell them something and\nthen I felt bad about that.\n\n299\n00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.910\nI didn't enjoy that kind of interaction.\n\n300\n00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:08.170\nI felt like I was your\ntypical sales person.\n\n301\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.990\nBut when I learned that we both want\nthe same thing, both the customer and\n\n302\n00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.400\nI want the same thing,\nthe exact right solution.\n\n303\n00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.810\nSell them the wrong product, just so\n\n304\n00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.200\nyou can make your commission,\nlose them forever.\n\n305\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.940\nSell them a product at too high of\na price, they find that out, and\n\n306\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.760\nthen they go to your competition\nto get a lower price.\n\n307\n00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:32.100\nSell them a product at too low of a price,\nyou go out of business,\n\n308\n00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.720\nthat's called bankruptcy,\nyou can't help them anymore.\n\n309\n00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.850\nSell them the exact right product at the\nexact right price, then deliver it late.\n\n310\n00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.410\nNo more client.\n\n311\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.000\nSell them the exact right product\nat the exact right price and\n\n312\n00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.760\nthen don't follow up and make sure that\nit works well, again you lose the client.\n\n313\n00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.090\nSo you have to sell them the exact\nright product at the exact right price\n\n314\n00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.620\nwhich is a price you make\na reasonable profit at,\n\n315\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.110\na good profit cuz you\nneed to stay in business.\n\n316\n00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.030\nYou need to invest in R&amp;D in your company.\n\n317\n00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.190\nYou've got to hire new people.\n\n318\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.040\nYou've got marketing costs.\n\n319\n00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.680\nSo if you've got a client that\nreally sees you as a partner,\n\n320\n00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.370\nthey understand you need\nto make a profit too.\n\n321\n00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.750\nSo the goal here, again,\nis to get the exact right solution.\n\n322\n00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.890\nIt's not you versus the customer.\n\n323\n00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.870\nIt's not you trying to win.\n\n324\n00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:19.930\nIt's you trying to make sure that\neverybody wins so you can come back and\n\n325\n00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:23.960\ndo more and more business with them and\nthey'll refer more and more people to you.\n\n326\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.600\nThat's what a true sales\nperson focuses on.\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.900\nIn section one, I shared with\nyou a lot of really great ideas.\n\n2\n00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.000\nSome very simple, but\n\n3\n00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.430\nvery powerful, about how to get the right\nmindset to be a consultator salesperson.\n\n4\n00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.500\nAnd again,\nI wanna give credit where credit is due,\n\n5\n00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.120\na lot of that information\ncame from what I learned\n\n6\n00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.040\nfrom Mahan Khalsa in his amazing book,\nLet's Get Real and Let's Not Play.\n\n7\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.640\nI highly recommend it.\n\n8\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.280\nNow I want to shift gears and talk about\nwhat it takes to differentiate yourself\n\n9\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.510\nin the marketplace and be considered among\nthe best in the world at what you do.\n\n10\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.870\nI've been teaching a class at\nthe Warton School of Business for\n\n11\n00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.590\nabout 15 years on strategic thinking and\nstrategic planning as a guest lecturer.\n\n12\n00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.110\nAnd it's an executive level class.\n\n13\n00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.190\nAnd it’s fairly complex there’s\nsome big ideas in there.\n\n14\n00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.270\nBut I want to sort of boil the entire\nclass down to one idea that sounds simple\n\n15\n00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.500\nbut is devilishly hard\nto actually implement.\n\n16\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.470\nSo here’s the main idea.\n\n17\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.370\nAll effective strategy is just\n\n18\n00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.539\nvalued differentiation times\ndisciplined execution.\n\n19\n00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.700\nSounds easy but\nhere's what you gotta do to implement it.\n\n20\n00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.920\nYou've gotta bring something that's\nunique, exciting, compelling to your\n\n21\n00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.020\ncustomer that they're willing to pay for,\nthat is difficult\n\n22\n00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.900\nif not impossible to copy and then be able\nto execute on it effectively every day.\n\n23\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.180\nAnd this goes for\nan individual or a business.\n\n24\n00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.620\nAnd let me say that again.\n\n25\n00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.990\nYou've got to bring something that's cool,\nexciting, unique, compelling, that your\n\n26\n00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.780\ncustomers highly value, that they're\nwilling to reach in their pocket and\n\n27\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.800\ngive you $5 or $50,000 or $50 million for,\nhappily, because they see the value in it.\n\n28\n00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.602\nThat is unique,\ndifficult if not impossible to copy,\n\n29\n00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:53.200\nand that you can actually\nflawlessly execute on it and\n\n30\n00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.270\ndeliver it to your client exactly\nthe way you said you would.\n\n31\n00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.270\nI wanna challenge you to sit down and\nthink about that.\n\n32\n00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.140\nWhat does your business bring to\nthe marketplace that's exciting,\n\n33\n00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.090\ncompelling, unique, wow.\n\n34\n00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.630\nThat your customers very highly value,\nthat your competition can't copy, and\n\n35\n00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.290\nthat your company can deliver flawlessly\n\n36\n00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.990\nevery single time to every\none of your customers.\n\n37\n00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.070\nBut let's take that a step further and\nan even bigger challenge.\n\n38\n00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.030\nWhat do you bring to the marketplace as\na sales person that meets that criteria?\n\n39\n00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.570\nWhat do you do that's unique,\nexciting, compelling, wow?\n\n40\n00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.580\nThat your customers find highly\nvaluable that it's difficult for\n\n41\n00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.550\nother sales people to copy it and that\nyou can actually deliver it every time.\n\n42\n00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.120\nIf you can figure that out, you have\ncreated an incredible differentiate in\n\n43\n00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.390\nthe market place, a huge market\nadvantage and you will truly position\n\n44\n00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.710\nyourself as a high-level consultant,\na high-level trusted advisor,\n\n45\n00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.510\nand among the best in your industry,\npossibly at the world of what you do.\n\n46\n00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.460\nWhich is the next thing\nI wanna share with you.\n\n47\n00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.020\nHow do you do that?\n\n48\n00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.840\nYears ago, more than 20 years ago,\nwhen I decided to get into this business\n\n49\n00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.530\nI decided if I was gonna become\na professional speaker, a trainer,\n\n50\n00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.360\na consultant, that I wanted to\nbe the best I could possibly be.\n\n51\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.670\nI wanted to be among the top\nin the world at what I did.\n\n52\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.400\nSo to do that, what I did is I looked\naround at everybody in my industry, and\n\n53\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.450\nI looked for the person that I\nthought was doing the absolute best,\n\n54\n00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.990\nthe person who was\nnumber one in the world.\n\n55\n00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.170\nAnd at the time I came into this industry,\nit was Tom Peters.\n\n56\n00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.310\nThis is the early 90s, he had just\nwritten In Search of Excellence,\n\n57\n00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.460\nhe was doing circuits all over the world.\n\n58\n00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.296\nHe was working for the White House,\nhe was working for every major company.\n\n59\n00:03:41.296 --> 00:03:47.428\nHe had just been on Time Magazine as\nthe Uber guru of management consulting.\n\n60\n00:03:47.428 --> 00:03:52.040\nSo here's what I did, I said okay,\nif that guy is number one in the world\n\n61\n00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.290\nwhat do I have to do to\nearn that same position?\n\n62\n00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.180\nAnd I went to school on Tom Peters.\n\n63\n00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.427\nI read everything I could about him.\n\n64\n00:03:59.427 --> 00:04:03.410\nI read his books, I studied his\nbackground, I went to his website.\n\n65\n00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.780\nI looked at all the articles\nhe had written.\n\n66\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.270\nI did everything I could to learn\neverything I possibly could about\n\n67\n00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.540\nhow did Tom Peters become number\none in the world at what he did.\n\n68\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.080\nAnd then I created a checklist.\n\n69\n00:04:16.815 --> 00:04:21.395\nHe's got massive research, he worked for\na top consulting firm, he's worked for\n\n70\n00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:23.355\ntop CEO's, top companies.\n\n71\n00:04:23.355 --> 00:04:28.465\nHe's done international work, he's got\nbest selling books, he's won major awards.\n\n72\n00:04:28.465 --> 00:04:33.615\nI mean, I put it all down in a list and\nthen I said to myself every single day,\n\n73\n00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:36.530\nwhat do I have to do to check\nsomething else off that list?\n\n74\n00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.590\nWhat do I have to do to get up today and\ncheck something off that list and\n\n75\n00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.360\nget one step closer to what it takes.\n\n76\n00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.650\nNot fake it until you make it.\n\n77\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.880\nTo what it actually takes to be considered\n\n78\n00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.250\none of the best in\nthe world at what I did.\n\n79\n00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.290\nNow there's a funny little story here\nbecause about halfway through that\n\n80\n00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.030\njourney, I actually met Tom Peters.\n\n81\n00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.840\nI went to the World Business Forum,\nwhere he was a speaker.\n\n82\n00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.540\nAnd for an additional amount, you could\npay to have lunch with Tom Peters and\n\n83\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.730\nabout 100 other people and\na couple of very high level CEOs.\n\n84\n00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.150\nAnd during the lunch, I got a chance\nto sit and talk with him just briefly.\n\n85\n00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.175\nAnd I told him, I'm coming after you.\n\n86\n00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:17.940\n[LAUGH] I want to be where you are.\n\n87\n00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.570\nI'm a speaker, I'm a consultant, I'm\nearly in my career, but my goal is to be\n\n88\n00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.640\nconsidered among the best in the world,\nequal with you or close to equal with you.\n\n89\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.085\nHe was polite, he smiled, and\nbasically said, good luck son.\n\n90\n00:05:31.085 --> 00:05:34.968\n[LAUGH] Because I'm sure he's\nheard that a zillion times before.\n\n91\n00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:39.280\nBut it didn't dissuade me at all.\n\n92\n00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.290\nI just kept checking stuff off that list.\n\n93\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.650\nAnd in 2015, I was named one of the top\n100 business thought leaders in America.\n\n94\n00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.180\nI was on a list of the top 100\nbusiness thought leaders in the world.\n\n95\n00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.300\nI was named one of the top 50 leaders to\nwatch in America along with Sergey Brin\n\n96\n00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.263\nand Larry Page from Google,\nJeff Bezos from Amazon.\n\n97\n00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:04.120\nWas named one of the top 50 small\nbusiness influencers in America.\n\n98\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.850\nOne of the top,\nwell we won't even go into it.\n\n99\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.560\nI won a bunch of a awards and\none of the most important was\n\n100\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.600\ntop 100 business speakers\nExperts in America.\n\n101\n00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.040\nAnd I looked at the list and it was in\nalphabetical order and there just four,\n\n102\n00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.670\nfive names ahead of me was Tom Peters,\nPeters Spence.\n\n103\n00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.160\nI finally made it,\nI was right on the list with him.\n\n104\n00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.430\nAnd I sent him a note, this is on October,\nI sent him a note and said, well,\n\n105\n00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.360\nI did it I don't know if you remember, but\n\n106\n00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.540\nabout seven years ago,\nI told you I was coming after you.\n\n107\n00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.510\nI was gonna try to get even with you and\nthis year I made it.\n\n108\n00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.800\nWe're on a couple of lists together and\n\n109\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.780\nI just wanna let you\nknow that I did make it.\n\n110\n00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.400\nAnd for Christmas that year, I got a hand\nsigned, leather collector's edition,\n\n111\n00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.110\nleather bound collector's edition\nof In Search of Excellence,\n\n112\n00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.670\nSigned by Tom Peters,\nthat said congratulations, you caught me.\n\n113\n00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.120\nNow I don't tell you this to impress you,\nbut\n\n114\n00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.635\nto impress upon you, I am not that smart.\n\n115\n00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:09.440\n[LAUGH] I failed out of\ncollege on the first try,\n\n116\n00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.620\ndid a little bit better on the second try.\n\n117\n00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.760\nBut if you truly wanna be among\nthe best in the world at what you do,\n\n118\n00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.530\nit's pretty straight forward.\n\n119\n00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.220\nSit down and\n\n120\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.305\nfigure out, what did the best people\nin my industry do to become the best?\n\n121\n00:07:22.305 --> 00:07:22.900\nWho are the top salespeople?\n\n122\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.540\nWho are the top consultants?\n\n123\n00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.940\nWho are the best of the best\nthat everybody looks up to?\n\n124\n00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.090\nAnd then find out everything you\ncan about what they actually did\n\n125\n00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.190\nto earn that position.\n\n126\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.790\nWhat did they learn, what degrees do\nthey have, what expertise do they have,\n\n127\n00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.140\nwhat kind of connections,\nwhat companies do they work with,\n\n128\n00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.780\nwhat awards have they won,\nwhat journals do they write in.\n\n129\n00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.200\nYou know, study them, go to their website.\n\n130\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.920\nIf you're lucky, pick up the phone and\ncall them or send them an email, and\n\n131\n00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.370\ncreate a real specific, focused list\nof all the things you've gotta,\n\n132\n00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:02.750\ngive, get, or give up to pay the price\nto actually do everything on that list.\n\n133\n00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.720\nAnd I can promise you from personal\nexperience, in just 17 years,\n\n134\n00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.620\nyou're an overnight success.\n\n135\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.390\nSo that's another idea about being\nthe best in the world at what you do and\n\n136\n00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.240\nhow to actually achieve that.\n\n137\n00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.950\nI want to share two more ideas\nwith you about how to become\n\n138\n00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.010\ntruly great at what you do.\n\n139\n00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:24.120\nAs one of my friends in\nCanada Dave Katz says epic [LAUGH].\n\n140\n00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.140\nAnd the first one, again, is very simple.\n\n141\n00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:33.340\nBut extremely few people do this and\nit's the idea of life long learning, or\n\n142\n00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.860\nwhat I like to call personal\ncontinuous incremental improvement.\n\n143\n00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:44.940\nIf you're not dedicating 10 or 15% of your\ntime to learning, improving your skills,\n\n144\n00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.270\ngetting new knowledge, reading books,\nstudying, watching videos,\n\n145\n00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.670\nreading blogs There's no way in\nthe world you'll become world class.\n\n146\n00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.010\nIT's just that simple.\n\n147\n00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.760\nLet me give you an example\nof how easy this is.\n\n148\n00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.330\nHow many book do you think the average\ncollege graduate reads per year for\n\n149\n00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.270\nself improvement or business improvement.\n\n150\n00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.330\nTo get better at their life or\n\n151\n00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:12.250\nbetter as you know a sales person per\nyear after they graduate from college.\n\n152\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.160\nThe answer is 0.5, a half a book.\n\n153\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.210\nI saw a couple of statistics lately that\nsaid the average business person reads\n\n154\n00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.960\none business book every five years.\n\n155\n00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.540\nI also saw another one that said if you\nwere to pick one topic in business and\n\n156\n00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.130\nread it for one hour a day,\nseven days a week for\n\n157\n00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:33.770\nseven years, you'd be considered\na national authority on that topic.\n\n158\n00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.300\nTo give you an example of how I won\nsome of those awards, I've been reading\n\n159\n00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.380\na minimum of 100 to 120 business\nbooks a year, every year since 1989,\n\n160\n00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:47.220\nand that does not include\nthe numerous audiobooks I listen to,\n\n161\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.350\nthe white papers, the blogs, the Harvard\narticles, everything I get my hands on.\n\n162\n00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.350\nConstantly learning.\n\n163\n00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.110\nAnd now, don't forget,\nthis is part of my job.\n\n164\n00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.240\nI mean, I'm supposed to be knowledgable\nand competent in what I do and\n\n165\n00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.940\nan expert in business,\nbut the bar is very low.\n\n166\n00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.540\nI mean if you were to\nread six books a year,\n\n167\n00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.670\nyou'd be in the top 1% in\nthe United States of America.\n\n168\n00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.250\nSix self help business books a year,\ntop 1% in America.\n\n169\n00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.440\nIf you read 12 books in a year,\nyou'd be in the top 1% in the world.\n\n170\n00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.340\nSo I'm going to stand right here and\ntell you with tremendous confidence\n\n171\n00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:26.090\nIf you dedicate yourself to life-long\nlearning, to watching videos, listening to\n\n172\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:31.380\naudiobooks, reading, studying, and\nyou give ourself 15% of your time.\n\n173\n00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.500\nJust watch a little bit less TV.\n\n174\n00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.450\nGet off Facebook for a little bit more.\n\n175\n00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.380\nAnd invest it in yourself.\n\n176\n00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.240\nI promise you you will look up three,\nfour, five years from now and\n\n177\n00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.420\nyou will crush the competition.\n\n178\n00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.800\nVery, very, very few people do this.\n\n179\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.580\nIt's easy but it takes self-discipline and\n\n180\n00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:57.000\nyou've got to realize that every book you\nread, every video you watch is helping\n\n181\n00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.760\nyou become better and will help you\nmake more money and be more successful.\n\n182\n00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.380\nAnd when you think about it that way,\n\n183\n00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.950\nyou realize it's a great\ninvestment of your time.\n\n184\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.930\nLast idea I want to share with you comes\nfrom a friend of mine, Tim Sanders,\n\n185\n00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.630\nwho wrote a great book called\nLove Is The Killer App.\n\n186\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.950\nActually, Tim has written a bunch of great\nbooks, and he's a phenomenal speaker, but\n\n187\n00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.780\nin this particular book he talked\nabout the three things that it\n\n188\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:22.510\ntakes to build a world class career, and\nI think he's just dead spot on here.\n\n189\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:27.830\nAnd here are the three things K,\nN, and L, KNL.\n\n190\n00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:33.420\nThe K stands for knowledge, you've gotta\nbe bright, sharp, smart, and talented.\n\n191\n00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.480\nYou've gotta have skills,\nabilities, ideas, innovations,\n\n192\n00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.220\nthat are highly valuable\nin the marketplace.\n\n193\n00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.140\nYou've gotta have information and\n\n194\n00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:46.880\ncreativity and ideas and knowledge\nthat people highly, highly value.\n\n195\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.890\nIf you've got a lot of knowledge\nthat people don't value,\n\n196\n00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.510\nthat doesn't help you\nmuch with your business.\n\n197\n00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.150\nSo, its gotta be information ideas that\npeople in the marketplace highly value,\n\n198\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.780\nkey idea there.\n\n199\n00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.530\nThe next letter N stands for network.\n\n200\n00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.470\nAnd by network, I mean what I call hubs.\n\n201\n00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.930\nPeople that by the nature of who they are,\nif they're really impressed with your\n\n202\n00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.190\nknowledge and the value you bring to the\nmarketplace, they don't tell a few people,\n\n203\n00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:17.450\nthey tell a few dozen, or a few hundred,\nor a few hundred thousand, or\n\n204\n00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.180\na million, literally,\nthrough social media.\n\n205\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:26.450\nThe future of word of mouth and\nreferrals is definitely social media.\n\n206\n00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.750\nI won't say the future of sales is\nsocial media, it definitely helps, but\n\n207\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.330\nif you want to get lots and lots of\nreferrals and build your reputation,\n\n208\n00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.620\nnetworking with people, that if they're\nreally impressed with your knowledge,\n\n209\n00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.340\ncan tell lots and lots of other people.\n\n210\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.570\nThat's super valuable.\n\n211\n00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.520\nLet me give you a real quick example here.\n\n212\n00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.250\nWhen I wrote my last book,\ncalled Awesomely Simple.\n\n213\n00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.300\nIt's a good book, it won a few awards, but\n\n214\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.030\nit wasn't wiping out the bestsellers list,\njust put it that way.\n\n215\n00:12:55.030 --> 00:13:01.380\nActually, it was number 1131 on\nthe amazon.com bestsellers list.\n\n216\n00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.570\nNot exactly impressive there.\n\n217\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.832\nUntil one person tweeted it.\n\n218\n00:13:06.832 --> 00:13:11.730\nGuy Kawasaki,\nthe former evangelist for Apple.\n\n219\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.680\nI don't know how he got the book,\nI didn't send it to him.\n\n220\n00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.790\nBut he read it and\nhe tweeted, really nice book,\n\n221\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.989\nenjoyed it a great deal,\nI highly recommend it.\n\n222\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:26.150\nI went from number 1131 to number 11 on\nthe Best Sellers list in about a day and\n\n223\n00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.360\na half, and got backordered for\nfour months at Amazon.com.\n\n224\n00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.210\nIt was unbelievable.\n\n225\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:35.270\nI mean, I sold thousands of\nbooks because of that one tweet.\n\n226\n00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:39.940\nBecause Guy Kawasaki, at the time,\nhad 1.2 million Twitter followers.\n\n227\n00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.890\nNow, I'm not saying a bunch of\nthe people you do business with have 1.2\n\n228\n00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.050\nmillion Twitter followers.\n\n229\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:49.640\nBut if it's somebody in an association and\nan industry you sell to.\n\n230\n00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.450\nIf you sell locally, if it's your Mayor or\nyour Head of the Chamber of Commerce or\n\n231\n00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.320\nthe Head of Kiwanis or\nsomething like that.\n\n232\n00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.920\nIf it's a customer that by the nature of\nwho they are deals with lots of other\n\n233\n00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.070\ncustomers like yours\nthat are non-competitive.\n\n234\n00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:10.490\nIf one person really is impressed by your\nknowledge and how valuable it is, and\n\n235\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.650\nthey've got hundreds or\nthousands of connections.\n\n236\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.490\nAnd then you've got the third thing,\nthe L, which is love.\n\n237\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.670\nIf you're a kind, honest,\nhigh integrity, high character person,\n\n238\n00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:25.100\na person of love, a lot of the right\npeople know that about you, hubs.\n\n239\n00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.910\nAnd they also know that you're extremely,\n\n240\n00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.560\nextremely knowledgeable about something\nthat's valued in the marketplace,\n\n241\n00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.160\nyou have the foundation of\nan absolutely world class career.\n\n242\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.100\nSo the three questions you\nhave to ask yourself everyday.\n\n243\n00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.570\nWhat did I learn today?\n\n244\n00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.830\nWho did I meet today?\n\n245\n00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.830\nAnd did I live my values?\n\n246\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.690\nIf everyday you're learning and growing\nand increasing your valuable knowledge,\n\n247\n00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.900\nyou're constantly networking\nwith anybody you can.\n\n248\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.260\nBut, especially with\npeople who are hubs and\n\n249\n00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.050\ncan introduce you to tons of other people.\n\n250\n00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.970\nAnd you guard your reputation\nwith everything you've got.\n\n251\n00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.130\nYou're good at what you do and you do it\nbecause you care about your customers.\n\n252\n00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.050\nYou have high competence,\nhigh concern and strong character.\n\n253\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.594\nYou have the makings of being truly\nworld class as a salesperson.\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.039\nIn this section, I wanna share with\nyou what I would consider the tools of\n\n2\n00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.180\nthe trade of being a trusted advisor and\nit's three key things.\n\n3\n00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.800\nAsking very, very good questions,\nbeing an intense listener and\n\n4\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.860\ntaking fantastic very thorough notes.\n\n5\n00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.290\nSo let's start with the questioning.\n\n6\n00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.783\nTo be really good as\na consultative salesperson,\n\n7\n00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:27.201\nyou have to act like a consultant.\n\n8\n00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:31.625\nAnd the ways consultants help their\ncustomers is being extremely,\n\n9\n00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:33.550\ninsanely curious.\n\n10\n00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.210\nSo it's your job to learn everything\nyou can about your customer and client.\n\n11\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.440\nEverything they'll share with you.\n\n12\n00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.640\nYou don't wanna be too aggressive.\n\n13\n00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.060\nYou can't ask them a thousand questions.\n\n14\n00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.990\nSo you wanna make sure that zero in and\npick a handful of expert questions,\n\n15\n00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.530\nthat are very focused that will give\nyou just the right information, for\n\n16\n00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.870\nyou to be able to give them\njust the right solution.\n\n17\n00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.960\nThere are some tools\nactually techniques but\n\n18\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.890\nI don't like that word,\nabout how to be an expert questioner.\n\n19\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.910\nAnd I'm gonna share a few of\nthose with you right now.\n\n20\n00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.140\nThe first one is what I call Cushions.\n\n21\n00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.860\nCushions sound like in order for\n\n22\n00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.020\nme to be able to help you\ncould you tell me about it?\n\n23\n00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.850\nIn order for me to be able to serve\nyou better, could you share with me?\n\n24\n00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.240\nSo that I can come up with\na great solution for you,\n\n25\n00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.690\ncould you take five minutes and tell me\nas much detail, whatever it might be.\n\n26\n00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.820\nThese are all questions that say I'm about\nto ask you a difficult, challenging, or\n\n27\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.730\nimportant question, but\nI'm doing it to help you.\n\n28\n00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.900\nTo serve you, to help you,\nto understand you, to not waste your time.\n\n29\n00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.020\nAnd that's exactly what customer's\nclients wanna hear from a salesperson is\n\n30\n00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.540\nI'm focused, I'm prepared,\n\n31\n00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.990\nI'm gonna ask just the right questions,\nI don't wanna waste your time.\n\n32\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.490\nThe next one is which called\na Conditioning Statement.\n\n33\n00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.790\nAnd a Conditioning Statement is something\nyou put on a front of a question\n\n34\n00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.880\nthat says, I learn something new,\nI have new information, and\n\n35\n00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.400\nbecause of that I have to\nask you this question.\n\n36\n00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.900\nIt sounds like I was looking\non your website and noticed.\n\n37\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.210\nI read in an industry article about\nyour industry that XYZ is happening.\n\n38\n00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.470\nHow would that impact in your company?\n\n39\n00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.410\nI talked to one of the folks\nthat works for you, and\n\n40\n00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.960\nthey mentioned you were having\ndifficulties with whatever it might be.\n\n41\n00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.700\nIn other words, I've got some new\ninformation, I saw something,\n\n42\n00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.080\nI read something,\nI interviewed somebody, and\n\n43\n00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.240\nbecause of this new information,\nI now need to ask you a new question.\n\n44\n00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.920\nThe next two are two of my very favorite.\n\n45\n00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.250\nThey're called expansion questions or\ncontraction questions.\n\n46\n00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.470\nWhen you get a customer who isn't giving\nyou much information, how's your business?\n\n47\n00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.360\nFine.\n\n48\n00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.590\nAre you having any challenges?\n\n49\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.890\nYes.\n\n50\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.010\nTell me about your challenges.\n\n51\n00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.660\nThere's a lot of them.\n\n52\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.930\nWhen you're getting those\nsorta short answers,\n\n53\n00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.470\nwhat an expansion question does is tells\nthe customer they need to talk more.\n\n54\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.600\nIt would sound like this, in order for\n\n55\n00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.220\nme to be able to help you, I need to\ndeeply understand your businesses much as\n\n56\n00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.360\npossible whatever you're\nwilling to share with me.\n\n57\n00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.750\nSo could you take the next four or five\nminutes and share with me everything you\n\n58\n00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.840\nthink I need to know about the challenges\nand opportunities your facing\n\n59\n00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.560\nin your business right now, specifically\naround your advertising and marketing.\n\n60\n00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.370\nAnd you notice I put that last\nin specifically around and\n\n61\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.780\nyou would put your industry,\nyour product, your service,\n\n62\n00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.150\ncuz you don't wanna grow off a tangent and\ntotally, if you're selling IT services,\n\n63\n00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.400\nyou don't need to hear about their\nmaintenance problems with their trucks.\n\n64\n00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.734\nThat might be a challenge,\nit might be important, but\n\n65\n00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:16.170\nit's not something you can fix.\n\n66\n00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.131\nSo you wanna focus that question\non areas that you can help in and\n\n67\n00:03:20.131 --> 00:03:24.040\nthen get them to talk for\nas long as you can with as much detail.\n\n68\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.736\nAnd by saying, could you take the next\nfour or five minutes and in as much detail\n\n69\n00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:31.320\nas possible earns you the right that\nafter they stop talking after a minute,\n\n70\n00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.110\nyou can look at your notepad and\ngo, what else?\n\n71\n00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.080\nIs there anything else?\n\n72\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.630\nAnd you can continue to ask them because\nthe way you phrase the question you've\n\n73\n00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.940\ntold them you want to give a lot of detail\nand you wanted to talk for a long time so\n\n74\n00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.050\nyou can politely push them to\ngive you more information.\n\n75\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.140\nOr you can just use one of the secret\ntools of a lot of sales people\n\n76\n00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.370\nwhich is one of the most powerful tools,\nsilence.\n\n77\n00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.690\nYou say this, anything else?\n\n78\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.500\nAnd then, you wait about four seconds\nbecause the average person can only handle\n\n79\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.300\nsilence for about three seconds.\n\n80\n00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.362\nSo after you sit there looking\nat your pad, looking at them,\n\n81\n00:04:04.362 --> 00:04:09.633\nwaiting to take a note and you just kind\nof Most people will just [SOUND] and\n\n82\n00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:11.149\njust start giving you some more stuff.\n\n83\n00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.520\nAnd if they don't then you quietly say,\nI guess that's everything.\n\n84\n00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.030\nLet's move on to the next question.\n\n85\n00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.050\nA contraction question is for\nthe opposite kind of client or customer.\n\n86\n00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.360\nOne that you go, so how's business?\n\n87\n00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.016\nAnd they go,\n\n88\n00:04:22.016 --> 00:04:25.913\nwell, in the dark ages this happened and\nI started the business in 1947.\n\n89\n00:04:25.913 --> 00:04:27.360\nAnd it goes on and on and on.\n\n90\n00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.240\nThey tell you everything and you ask them\none question they talk for 20 minutes.\n\n91\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.350\nCustomers like that you\nneed to focus them back in.\n\n92\n00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.820\nSo a contraction question says\nthe opposite of an expansion says.\n\n93\n00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.600\nBob, I know this is important to you.\n\n94\n00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.530\nCould you just take one minute or\n\n95\n00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.000\nlast to tell me the single biggest\nchallenge you're facing right now?\n\n96\n00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.530\nWhat I've just told them is don't talk for\n20 minutes only wanna hear one thing and\n\n97\n00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.620\nit's gonna be your single biggest,\nyour most important.\n\n98\n00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.940\nSo it's,\ncould you just take 30 seconds and\n\n99\n00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.790\nshare with me your one highest priority?\n\n100\n00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.390\nDid you take two minutes or less and give\nme the top three things that you think\n\n101\n00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.280\nare the most important things for\nme to focus on to be able to help you?\n\n102\n00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.620\nThe next one is what I\ncall the rating questions.\n\n103\n00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.210\nAnd rating questions are asking\npeople to rate a product, a service,\n\n104\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.510\ntheir concern their fear.\n\n105\n00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.328\nWhatever it might be.\n\n106\n00:05:15.328 --> 00:05:18.440\nOpportunity on a scale of one to five or\none to ten.\n\n107\n00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.089\nLet me give you an example.\n\n108\n00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:26.444\nBob, on a scale of one to ten, with ten\nbeing awesome and one being terrible,\n\n109\n00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:30.263\nhow would you rate the current level\nof service you're getting from\n\n110\n00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:32.920\nthe organization you're working with?\n\n111\n00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.160\nSue, on a scale of one to five with\nfive being extremely important and\n\n112\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.240\none being not important at all.\n\n113\n00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.990\nHow important would you say\nit is to get this initiative\n\n114\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.540\noff the ground within 45 days?\n\n115\n00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.430\nOn a scale of one to ten, with ten being\noutstanding and one being terrible,\n\n116\n00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.060\nhow would currently rate the service that\nwe're providing to your organization?\n\n117\n00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.770\nThis is if you're doing upselling or\ncross-selling.\n\n118\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.950\nAnd the key idea with all of these is.\n\n119\n00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.170\nIf you want the score to be higher,\nfor example,\n\n120\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.000\nI ask them,\nhow good is our service right now?\n\n121\n00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.088\nAnd they go, [SOUND], seven.\n\n122\n00:06:03.088 --> 00:06:05.420\nYou go, what would it take to\nmake it an eight, nine, or a ten?\n\n123\n00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.170\nAnd what, specifically,\nwould it take to get it to eight?\n\n124\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.610\nThen, what would I have\nto do to get to nine?\n\n125\n00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.630\nThen, what would it take to get it to ten?\n\n126\n00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.800\nNow, I'm getting good specific\nfocused answers on what\n\n127\n00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.020\nI have to do to improve the relationship.\n\n128\n00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.180\nThe reversal is if you ask\non a scale of one to five,\n\n129\n00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.950\nwith five being world class and\none being terrible.\n\n130\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.879\nHow would you rate our competitors\nproduct, and they go five.\n\n131\n00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:30.990\nAnd you say why specifically\nwould you rate it a five.\n\n132\n00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.590\nAnd then, you have the chance\nto either make yours a five or\n\n133\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.910\ndrop theirs down to a two or\na three by asking appropriate questions.\n\n134\n00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.650\nNot slamming the competition, but\nsaying well did you know about this?\n\n135\n00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.550\nWell, how's about that?\n\n136\n00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.380\nWell, you said you needed this but\n\n137\n00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.520\nactually it's my understanding\ntheir product won't do that.\n\n138\n00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.410\nIt will do something closely but\nnot exactly what you're looking for\n\n139\n00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.160\nwhereas our product will do\nexactly what you're looking for.\n\n140\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.350\nLet's take a look at the specs for both.\n\n141\n00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.060\nAnd again, you're not slamming,\nyou're just saying let's do apples to\n\n142\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.050\napples comparison and let's look\nat how you're measured on a scale.\n\n143\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.930\nHow good are they?\n\n144\n00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.670\nHow good do you think we are?\n\n145\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.080\nHow can I make them lower, us higher and\nmake sure that in your decision making\n\n146\n00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.540\ncriteria that I'm winning\nas far as the scale goes.\n\n147\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.620\nWhich brings me to another great question.\n\n148\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.090\nAnd I think that there is a couple that\nyou have got to ask no matter what.\n\n149\n00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.450\nAnd those are the key business questions\naround what is your budget, what is your\n\n150\n00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.780\ntimeframe, what is your decision making\nprocess, who else will be involved in\n\n151\n00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.220\nthe decision, what other companies'\nproducts and services are you currently\n\n152\n00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.110\nlooking at Is there anything that I\nhaven't covered that's important to you?\n\n153\n00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.010\nThese are all extra questions that you\nneed you to sit down and write down and\n\n154\n00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.260\nsay, every time my men in front\nof a client and I'm there for\n\n155\n00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.760\na sales call, what are key questions\nthat I have to get answered\n\n156\n00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.110\nin order to move this sale forward?\n\n157\n00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.510\nWhat are our next steps?\n\n158\n00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.150\nWhat would it take for you to be\ncomfortable in signing this contract?\n\n159\n00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.206\nI'm not pressuring you today but\nlet's say in the next 10 days, 15 days,\n\n160\n00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:01.963\nto make sure that we get things moving so\nthat we can meet your timelines.\n\n161\n00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:03.683\nYou've just heard me say something.\n\n162\n00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:06.070\nI hate pressure salespeople.\n\n163\n00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.600\nAs matter of fact,\nI personally have a technique I use.\n\n164\n00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.880\nI hate to use that word again, but a way\nthat I ask questions which is I'll say,\n\n165\n00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.040\nif you decided to do business with us,\nwhat are the next steps you'd\n\n166\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.920\nwanna go through in order\nto solidify that decision.\n\n167\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.796\nIf it turns out that our\nproduct is right for you,\n\n168\n00:08:22.796 --> 00:08:27.330\nthen I'm gonna be do everything I can to\nhelp you make a good decision, but if our\n\n169\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.750\nproduct isn't I will also help you find\nsomeone else who can deliver it for you.\n\n170\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.370\nNow when I just said that a lot\nof people go but I will tell you\n\n171\n00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.550\nin my own career I've had great success in\ntaking the pressure off the customer and\n\n172\n00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.680\nsaying I'm not here to\nsell you my product.\n\n173\n00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.280\nI'm here to get you\nthe exact right solution,\n\n174\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.260\nsomething that will solve\nyour needs perfectly.\n\n175\n00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.170\nI think that's my product and service.\n\n176\n00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.240\nI hope it is.\n\n177\n00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.160\nBut if it isn't,\n\n178\n00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.960\nyou can depend on me to do everything I\ncan to help you find the right person\n\n179\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.030\nto get you the right product at the right\nprice and exactly solve your problem.\n\n180\n00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.890\nThat immediately takes\nthe pressure off the situation.\n\n181\n00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.440\nYou're now seen as a trusted advisor,\nas a friend,\n\n182\n00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.520\nas someone who's trying to help them.\n\n183\n00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.750\nNot just someone who's trying to\nclose a deal and get a commission.\n\n184\n00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.919\nAnd here's what I'll also tell you,\n90% of the time,\n\n185\n00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:18.650\n95% time they're gonna buy from you.\n\n186\n00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.220\nYou will have the right solution.\n\n187\n00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.916\nYou will be able to sell them\nsomething that will truly help them.\n\n188\n00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:27.180\n5 or 10% of the time you need to\nhave the courage and the honesty and\n\n189\n00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.020\nthe character to say our\nproduct isn't right.\n\n190\n00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.110\nAnd if I sold it to you,\nyou would be unhappy.\n\n191\n00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.462\nIt isn't gonna solve your problem.\n\n192\n00:09:33.462 --> 00:09:36.150\nOr this gonna help you take\nadvantage of this opportunity.\n\n193\n00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.560\nSo let me recommend XYZ company.\n\n194\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.910\nThey've got a product or service that's\ngonna match your needs perfectly, and\n\n195\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:48.140\nactually, if you call Tom Jones over\nthere, he's their best sales person.\n\n196\n00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.570\nI know him personally.\n\n197\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.430\nI'll call him and\ntell him take great care of you.\n\n198\n00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.670\nYou'll be very pleased with their product.\n\n199\n00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.310\nHere's what happens.\n\n200\n00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.410\nWhen you do that,\nyou're now built a massive level of trust.\n\n201\n00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.900\nAnd the person knows that you're always\ndoing what's in their best interest and\n\n202\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.840\nthe next time you are there, and you tell\nthem that you have the right products and\n\n203\n00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.810\nservice and you do,\nthey will buy from you immediately.\n\n204\n00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.430\nAnd they will not beat you up\non price because they know\n\n205\n00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.150\nthat you're taking care of them.\n\n206\n00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.590\nAlong those same lines another type of\nquestion that I like to ask is what I call\n\n207\n00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.990\nrelationship questions or\nemotion questions.\n\n208\n00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.840\nAnd that's, how do you feel about this,\nor am I going at a good pace?\n\n209\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.920\nHave I missed anything\nthat's important to you?\n\n210\n00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.730\nAre you comfortable with\nwhat we're discussing here?\n\n211\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.670\nThese are all things saying, how do we,\nhow's the relationship going?\n\n212\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.420\nHow are you feeling?\n\n213\n00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.830\nAre we doing, cuz remember,\n\n214\n00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:38.270\nthis is important, people buy on\nan emotion-logic-emotion scale.\n\n215\n00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.160\nAll purchases,\nwhether it's a Boeing 747 jet or\n\n216\n00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.790\na candy bar, start with some sort\nof emotion of dissatisfaction.\n\n217\n00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.560\nThen you've gotta logically justify\nthe purchase, and then at the end,\n\n218\n00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.650\nit comes down to, do they trust you?\n\n219\n00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.510\nDo they believe you?\n\n220\n00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.400\nDo they feel like you have the right\nproduct, the right service,\n\n221\n00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.290\nat the right price that's a win,\nwin, win for everybody?\n\n222\n00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.370\nSo every decision starts with,\n\n223\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.600\nevery purchasing decision starts with\nsomething isn't right, right now.\n\n224\n00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.470\nI don't like the situation.\n\n225\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.700\nI want it to be different.\n\n226\n00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.030\nI wanna make some pain go away.\n\n227\n00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.680\nI wanna take advantage of an opportunity.\n\n228\n00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.400\nI wanna make something better.\n\n229\n00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.910\nBut something happened that\nthey're no longer happy with.\n\n230\n00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.080\nYou know car sales is a great one.\n\n231\n00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.930\nMaybe your car is old and\nthe stuff's hanging down.\n\n232\n00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:22.730\nAnd it's breaking down.\n\n233\n00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.150\nAnd you say,\nI gotta get rid of this clunker.\n\n234\n00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.020\nI hate this car.\n\n235\n00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.950\nI gotta go get a new one.\n\n236\n00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.120\nIt might also be that you\nhave a pretty good car,\n\n237\n00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.630\nbut your neighbor buys\na brand new Mercedes or BMW.\n\n238\n00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.470\nAnd you go now my car looks pretty\nbad compared to that really cool car.\n\n239\n00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.040\nI don't want to look [LAUGH]\nlike I can't afford that.\n\n240\n00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.580\nThe emotion is jealousy or pride.\n\n241\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.000\nAnd you go buy a new Corvette or\nwhatever it might be.\n\n242\n00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.540\nIt can be any kind of emotion.\n\n243\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.340\nPositive, negative, opportunity,\nchallenge, personal, business.\n\n244\n00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.500\nBut that emotion starts, then they have to\ngo out and logically justify the purchase.\n\n245\n00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.690\nAnd that's the checklist, go into a car.\n\n246\n00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.100\nWhat's the color?\n\n247\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.860\nWhat's the make?\n\n248\n00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.930\nWhat's the model?\n\n249\n00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.000\nDoes it have leather interior?\n\n250\n00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.060\nDoes it have air conditioning?\n\n251\n00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.890\nDoes it have tinted windows?\n\n252\n00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.960\nYou know, does it come with a warranty?\n\n253\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.540\nIs it new?\n\n254\n00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.490\nIs it used?\n\n255\n00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.370\nAll of those.\n\n256\n00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.890\nWhat's the payment?\n\n257\n00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.980\nAll of those are key decision criteria,\nand\n\n258\n00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.030\neach person will have different criteria.\n\n259\n00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.490\nSo it's very important you ask him.\n\n260\n00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.820\nLet's use the car example.\n\n261\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:26.210\nIn looking at a car today, what are the\nfour or five absolutely critical criteria\n\n262\n00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:30.220\nthat we've got address in order to find\nsomething that is exactly what you want.\n\n263\n00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.690\nAnd this could be in any situation.\n\n264\n00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.340\nBuying anything.\n\n265\n00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:38.500\nYou wanna know if you're the salesperson,\nwhat is the customers decision criteria?\n\n266\n00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.630\nWho will make the decision?\n\n267\n00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.380\nHow will they make it?\n\n268\n00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.950\nWhat are they gonna measure it against?\n\n269\n00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.590\nWhat's the checklist they have?\n\n270\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.690\nIf they're already shopping,\nhow do they check off the ideas for\n\n271\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.760\nthe competitions product or service?\n\n272\n00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.810\nVery important to understand\nthe logical justification.\n\n273\n00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.450\nAnd then at the end of the sale,\n\n274\n00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.440\nthey're gonna make a decision\nwhether they like you and trust you.\n\n275\n00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.550\nThis is the relationship part of the sale,\nthe reason you asked those relationship\n\n276\n00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:05.650\nquestions, but you will not be\na consistently successful, high-level,\n\n277\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:11.250\nconsultative sales person if you try to\nbase the entire sale on relationship.\n\n278\n00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.750\nI might like you.\n\n279\n00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.590\nI might think you're a great person.\n\n280\n00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.460\nBut if I don't think you're competent and\n\n281\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.820\nI don't think you understand\nyour products and services and\n\n282\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.360\nI don't think you understand me,\nI don't wanna buy anything from you.\n\n283\n00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.480\nBecause if it's mission\ncritical in my business or\n\n284\n00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.690\nit's important to me personally, I don't\nwanna make a bad purchasing decision.\n\n285\n00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.070\nAnd I don't feel like you can\nhelp me make a great decision.\n\n286\n00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.520\nMight be a great person, but\nyou don't have the tools, the experience,\n\n287\n00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.290\nthe background, and\n\n288\n00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:40.580\nthe knowledge to help me make a great\ndecision to get the exact right solution.\n\n289\n00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.550\nHere's what I'll finish on with questions.\n\n290\n00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.370\nYou can't do this on the fly.\n\n291\n00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.220\nYou've gotta practice.\n\n292\n00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.600\nThis takes a lot of practice.\n\n293\n00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.070\nYou've gotta write these questions out.\n\n294\n00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.412\nYou've gotta craft them carefully.\n\n295\n00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:52.060\nYou've gotta look at every single word and\n\n296\n00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.990\nthink about what are the words I wanna\nhave come out of my customer's mouth?\n\n297\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.180\nNot manipulate them.\n\n298\n00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:57.960\nNever manipulate them.\n\n299\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.630\nBut if I wanna long answer.\n\n300\n00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.590\nI wanna short answer.\n\n301\n00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.890\nWhat detail do I want?\n\n302\n00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.730\nWhether I want information on.\n\n303\n00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.620\nYou need to think about what's\nthe information I really, really need and\n\n304\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.460\nthen back up and ask a question\nto get exactly the right answer.\n\n305\n00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.590\nIf you try to do this on the fly.\n\n306\n00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.150\nAnd now, let's do the reverse.\n\n307\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.050\nI'm not saying write these out and go,\nquestion number three, blah, blah, blah,\n\n308\n00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.780\nblah, blah, and\nthen read it off your notepad.\n\n309\n00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.820\nThat's not it.\n\n310\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.610\nCraft them.\n\n311\n00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.170\nWork on them.\n\n312\n00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.350\nPractice them.\n\n313\n00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:30.450\nAnd then be able to do it prepared,\nbut not paint by the numbers formula.\n\n314\n00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.080\nYou wanna be able to look at them, and\ntalk to them, and ask your great question.\n\n315\n00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.460\nYou don't wanna be reading\nall your questions.\n\n316\n00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:39.240\nYou might glance down to look at what's\nthe next kind of question you wanna ask.\n\n317\n00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.700\nBut you've gotta be good enough at this,\nthrough practice,\n\n318\n00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:46.750\nto ask exceedingly well-worded\nquestions that are highly professional.\n\n319\n00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.940\nThat are easy for\nthe client/customer to understand and\n\n320\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:54.570\nwe'll get you the exact information you\nneed in order to move the sale forward.\n\n321\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.460\nNow I'd like to take a few minutes and\nshare with you what I think\n\n322\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.820\nis the absolute best questioning\nsystem I've ever learned.\n\n323\n00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.340\nIt comes from the book called Spin Selling\nby Neil Rackham, absolutely outstanding.\n\n324\n00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.020\nAgain.\nI mentioned this earlier that I had two or\n\n325\n00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.450\nthree top favorite books.\n\n326\n00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.450\nThis is one of the top two or three.\n\n327\n00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.350\nI believe that this book, Spin Selling,\n\n328\n00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.270\nis fundamental to being a great\nconsultative salesperson, and\n\n329\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.480\nthe other book I mentioned earlier,\nLet's Get Real or Let's Not Play.\n\n330\n00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.140\nAnd at the end of this,\n\n331\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:25.030\nI'm gonna have a whole list of recommended\nbooks, but these two are must reads.\n\n332\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.850\nWhat Spin Selling stands for\nis not spin them around,\n\n333\n00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.790\nbut spin is an acronym for\nsituation questions,\n\n334\n00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:36.780\nproblem questions, implication questions,\nand then needs questions.\n\n335\n00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.320\nAnd I like this system very much, by\nthe way the book is a little challenging,\n\n336\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.310\nyou've gotta read it three or four times,\nyou've gotta practice them a lot.\n\n337\n00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.400\nLike I said earlier,\nit's not a paint by numbers approach.\n\n338\n00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.945\nYou learn it that way and then you\nbecome an artist with it you know.\n\n339\n00:15:49.945 --> 00:15:54.008\nYou gotta move it around juggle it use\nit in different ways, but if you study\n\n340\n00:15:54.008 --> 00:15:58.283\nthe beginning it's gonna take a while you\ngonna have to really work on it a lot.\n\n341\n00:15:58.283 --> 00:15:59.976\nI went through training on this.\n\n342\n00:15:59.976 --> 00:16:01.781\nAnd I thought it was a great system.\n\n343\n00:16:01.781 --> 00:16:04.580\nBut it didn't quite fit\nthe way that I like to sell.\n\n344\n00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.210\nSo I made some changes.\n\n345\n00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:11.230\nAnd I changed it into the SCCCS model.\n\n346\n00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.480\nAnd here is what this stands for.\n\n347\n00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.780\nThe S is situation, very similar.\n\n348\n00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.930\nWhat's going on in your business?\n\n349\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:16.870\nWhat's happening in your life?\n\n350\n00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.140\nWhat's happened since\nthe last time I met with you?\n\n351\n00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.400\nYou don't ask a lot of\nthese type of questions.\n\n352\n00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.340\nBut it's one that you want to ask\nto just sort of get a general feel.\n\n353\n00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.260\nIt's almost like an icebreaker.\n\n354\n00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.710\nAnd it's a really good idea to sit\ndown and write this question out.\n\n355\n00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.120\nGet it extremely good, very focused.\n\n356\n00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.860\nSo that when you start the meeting, you\nstart with an excellent situation question\n\n357\n00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.030\nthat moves you into the entire meeting.\n\n358\n00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.030\nThe first C is what I\ncall challenge questions.\n\n359\n00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.860\nAnd they call problem questions.\n\n360\n00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.170\nAnd the reason I don't\nlike problems is problems,\n\n361\n00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:50.480\nto me, says that there's\nsomething wrong I've got to fix.\n\n362\n00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.090\nThere's an issue,\nsomething that's not happening right.\n\n363\n00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.970\nWell, actually, you can have very positive\nproblems, which I call opportunities.\n\n364\n00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.810\nSo, I change it to challenges because\nthere are multiple different ways you can\n\n365\n00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:02.870\nhelp people.\n\n366\n00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.270\nYou can have a problem or a challenge.\n\n367\n00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.570\nYou can have something\nthey want to have go away.\n\n368\n00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:09.260\nOr something they want to get more of.\n\n369\n00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.840\nThey might wanna stop doing something.\n\n370\n00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.660\nThey might have an opportunity\nthey want to take advantage of.\n\n371\n00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.410\nSo you've got both sides,\ncould be positive or negative.\n\n372\n00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.240\nIt can also be business or personal.\n\n373\n00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.600\nI might have business issues\nthat I want to solve.\n\n374\n00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.415\nBusiness challenges that I\nwant to take advantage of.\n\n375\n00:17:24.415 --> 00:17:27.710\nBusiness opportunities that I want to\ngo out and chase in the marketplace.\n\n376\n00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.080\nIt might also be personal.\n\n377\n00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.480\nIt might be that I want to\nsave time at the office, so\n\n378\n00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.750\nI can go spend more time\nat home with my family.\n\n379\n00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.420\nThere's also three more elements.\n\n380\n00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.407\nAnd that's time, money and people.\n\n381\n00:17:37.407 --> 00:17:40.270\nI want to save time, or\nI want to have more time.\n\n382\n00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.028\nI want to increase the amount of time\nthat I have to work on something.\n\n383\n00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:45.110\nI want to shorten the time span.\n\n384\n00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.180\nI want my people to be able\nto come in earlier and\n\n385\n00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.260\nhave the IT system up and working.\n\n386\n00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.420\nI want to be able to increase\nthe time they work at night, so\n\n387\n00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.280\nthat we can work with\nour operations in India.\n\n388\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.940\nThere's all kinds of ways to help\npeople save time, increase time.\n\n389\n00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.480\nChange the amount of time they\nhave to spend on something.\n\n390\n00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.400\nThe next one is money, and\nthat one's pretty straight forward.\n\n391\n00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.090\nAnd unfortunately, it's the one that\nmost salespeople focus on exclusively.\n\n392\n00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.960\nI'm going to drop my price\nto help you save money.\n\n393\n00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.900\nPeople want to save money.\n\n394\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.270\nThey also want to make more money.\n\n395\n00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.440\nROI is a big thing.\n\n396\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.760\nAnd then we can add in payback.\n\n397\n00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.690\nWhich is, how long does it\ntake to get my money back?\n\n398\n00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.190\nAnother time element.\n\n399\n00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.030\nSo you want to look at money.\n\n400\n00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.650\nAnd say, how can I expand their money?\n\n401\n00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.090\nHow can I save them money?\n\n402\n00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.020\nHow can they invest to get more money?\n\n403\n00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.520\nThere's lots and\nlots of ways to look at money.\n\n404\n00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.580\nAnd consultative salespeople know that I\nam going to charge a reasonable price.\n\n405\n00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.050\nBecause I am going to\ngive you a great return.\n\n406\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:36.370\nWhatever you spend with me.\n\n407\n00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:39.580\nYou're going to get back way\nmore value than you spent.\n\n408\n00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.340\nSo its going to be a great deal for\nboth of us.\n\n409\n00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.640\nWhich is one of the reasons you\ndon't want to drop your price.\n\n410\n00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.070\nRemember, you train\npeople how to treat you.\n\n411\n00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.360\nAnd you especially train customers\nhow to treat you around price.\n\n412\n00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.370\nIf they give you a little pushback and\nyou automatically drop your price.\n\n413\n00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.180\nThey know they can do that every time.\n\n414\n00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.510\nBut if they give you a little pushback and\nyou demonstrate massive value.\n\n415\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.650\nAnd you help them understand\nwhat you're doing that's in\n\n416\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.360\nexcess of what they expected.\n\n417\n00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.620\nWhat more value you're delivering.\n\n418\n00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.490\nAll the new things you're putting on it.\n\n419\n00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.790\nThat's why you're charging more money.\n\n420\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.730\nNow you've got to a partnership level\nwhere it's not about beating each other up\n\n421\n00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:13.370\non price.\n\n422\n00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:17.120\nBut it's finding the exact right solution\nat the exact right price that are both\n\n423\n00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.760\ngreat for both parties.\n\n424\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.030\nAnd then the last one.\n\n425\n00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.710\nTime, money, people.\n\n426\n00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.460\nCan I add more people to my staff?\n\n427\n00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.370\nCan I remove people from my staff?\n\n428\n00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.230\nCan I go spend more time with my family?\n\n429\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.070\nWill I have more time to travel?\n\n430\n00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.170\nCan I invest more time at the office\nby not spending time on this\n\n431\n00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.180\nother stuff that I can\nreplace with different tasks?\n\n432\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.315\nSo I want you to think\nabout this very carefully.\n\n433\n00:19:37.315 --> 00:19:39.950\nBecause this is something you\nreally got to sit down and work on.\n\n434\n00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:44.500\nRealize that when you've got challenges,\nthey're positive or negative.\n\n435\n00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.050\nBusiness or personal.\n\n436\n00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.060\nAnd they could be around time,\nmoney, or people.\n\n437\n00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.500\nWhich gives you lots and\nlots of places to add value.\n\n438\n00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.240\nLots of problems you can solve.\n\n439\n00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.380\nLots of opportunities you can\nhave to take advantage of.\n\n440\n00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.380\nMultiple ways to add value instead\nof just dropping your price.\n\n441\n00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.730\nNow, here's the type of questions\nthat really make or break the deal.\n\n442\n00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.260\nThis is the game changer.\n\n443\n00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.580\nAnd these are cost questions.\n\n444\n00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:13.870\nAnd the way I say this is, what does it\ncost you to not get rid of that problem or\n\n445\n00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.340\ntake advantage of that opportunity?\n\n446\n00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.100\nAnd the key idea here is you've\ngot to be able to quantify it.\n\n447\n00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.130\nAs much as possible.\n\n448\n00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.110\nYou've got to be able to put a number\non it, an amount of time on it.\n\n449\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.210\nAn amount of people on it.\n\n450\n00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.670\nAnd if you could put time and people\non it, you could transfer it to money.\n\n451\n00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:28.580\nSo you've got to look at.\n\n452\n00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.490\nEvery time they mention an issue,\na challenge, an opportunity, a problem.\n\n453\n00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.960\nHow can I go in there and say,\nmy solution will help you in this way.\n\n454\n00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.270\nAnd this is the value.\n\n455\n00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.740\nIt saves you this much time,\nwhich equals this much money.\n\n456\n00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.366\nIt allows you to have this more\nmany people on your staff.\n\n457\n00:20:44.366 --> 00:20:47.330\nWhich is going to generate\nthis much more revenue.\n\n458\n00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.640\nBecause here's the way you look at it is.\n\n459\n00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.460\nWhen you come in for most clients.\n\n460\n00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.300\nTheir problem seems small.\n\n461\n00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.580\nAnd in comparison,\nthe price of your solution seems big.\n\n462\n00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.015\nAnd the scales are tilted real\nbad because they're going.\n\n463\n00:21:00.015 --> 00:21:03.180\nI've got a problem, but\nit's not that big of a problem.\n\n464\n00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.330\nWhat you need to do through positive,\nnegative.\n\n465\n00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.140\nBusiness, personal,\ntime, money and people.\n\n466\n00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:10.790\nOpportunities.\n\n467\n00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.760\nYou've got to quantify those\nchallenges and opportunities, and\n\n468\n00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.280\nstart to move the scale.\n\n469\n00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.350\nAnd keep adding more value, more value.\n\n470\n00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.760\nI can save you time.\n\n471\n00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.670\nI can help you get into a new market.\n\n472\n00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.160\nI can help you spend more\ntime with your family.\n\n473\n00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.290\nI can allow you to get a new\nproduct to market faster.\n\n474\n00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:27.490\nAll these things are little things.\n\n475\n00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.560\nAnd some of them are going\nto save a little money.\n\n476\n00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.210\nSome of them are going to\nbring a little bit of ROI.\n\n477\n00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.690\nSome will bring huge ROI, or\nbring in massive new revenue.\n\n478\n00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.610\nAnd you keep piling them on the scale.\n\n479\n00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.110\nUntil, now, the price of your solution.\n\n480\n00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:44.660\nThe value of your solution seems small in\ncomparison to the price of the problem.\n\n481\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.060\nYou've got a very small thing.\n\n482\n00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.700\nThe problem now seems much bigger.\n\n483\n00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.760\nAnd you've got lots and\nlots of ways to add value.\n\n484\n00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.890\nOne of the biggest problems I\nsee in a lot of salespeople is\n\n485\n00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.710\nthey've only got one way\nto solve the problem.\n\n486\n00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.410\nDrop the price.\n\n487\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.820\nIf you've got multiple\nways to solve problems and\n\n488\n00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.490\ntake advantage of opportunities.\n\n489\n00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.420\nAnd you can quantify each one of them.\n\n490\n00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.950\nWhat you're doing is building up, building\nup, building up, building up the value\n\n491\n00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:13.050\nof your solution to where it is so\nmuch, that it's a no brainer.\n\n492\n00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.090\nAnd that's the way I want it to be for\nmy customer.\n\n493\n00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:18.240\nAnother big idea here is,\nwhenever possible.\n\n494\n00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.890\nGet the customer to give you the numbers.\n\n495\n00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:21.970\nYou don't say, well.\n\n496\n00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.400\nI think if we implement this solution.\n\n497\n00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.390\nProbably within six months you'll have\nan ROI of half a million dollars.\n\n498\n00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:28.800\nThat isn't gonna work.\n\n499\n00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.980\nWhat you do is ask them.\n\n500\n00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.250\nIf we can implement this solution,\nand alleviate these problems you have.\n\n501\n00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.750\nAnd give you an opportunity to take\n\n502\n00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.990\nadvantage of some of these\nmarket opportunities.\n\n503\n00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.836\nWhat sort of a financial\nnumber would you put on that?\n\n504\n00:22:42.836 --> 00:22:45.830\nI know it's just back of\nthe envelope sort of stuff here.\n\n505\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:50.400\nBut, roughly, what kind of a return do you\nthink you would get on the investment?\n\n506\n00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.240\nAnd if they say 70 million or\n100 million, it's better than your guess.\n\n507\n00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.000\nIf they say five million, then you\ncan ask them a few more questions.\n\n508\n00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.670\nAnd start to build that solution up,\nbuild that value up.\n\n509\n00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:05.921\nShow them it's not really a five million\nROI on your million dollar investment.\n\n510\n00:23:05.921 --> 00:23:07.360\nIt's a 50 million dollar ROI.\n\n511\n00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.501\nAnd again,\nnow the decision becomes a no-brainer.\n\n512\n00:23:10.501 --> 00:23:15.940\nSo you've got to learn to be able to\nask the sort of questions that quantify\n\n513\n00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.030\nthe opportunities and\nthe challenges, the problems.\n\n514\n00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:23.420\nAnd you want as much as possible for\nthe customer to give you those numbers.\n\n515\n00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.080\nSo that you can say.\n\n516\n00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.130\nYou said to me that you thought\n\n517\n00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.340\nthat you could save xyz dollars\nby implementing this solution.\n\n518\n00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.920\nOr you said you could\nprobably increase revenues\n\n519\n00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.050\nby xyz million dollars with my solution.\n\n520\n00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.560\nAnd that way, it's not you telling them or\ntrying to manipulate them.\n\n521\n00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.230\nIt's you basically saying, this is what\nyou feel the value of the solution is.\n\n522\n00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.963\nAnd because of your numbers,\n\n523\n00:23:46.963 --> 00:23:50.230\nit seems to me that this would\nbe a good decision for you.\n\n524\n00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.450\nThe third c are what I call\ncustomer needs questions.\n\n525\n00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:54.808\nAnd these are very simple.\n\n526\n00:23:54.808 --> 00:23:58.747\nYou just ask them, what do you think\nit will take to solve this problem?\n\n527\n00:23:58.747 --> 00:24:02.228\nWhat do you think it will take for\nyou to take advantage of this opportunity?\n\n528\n00:24:02.228 --> 00:24:06.208\nIn other words, what do you think you\nneed in order to take advantage of\n\n529\n00:24:06.208 --> 00:24:10.001\nthe opportunity, get rid of the problem,\nhandle the challenge?\n\n530\n00:24:10.001 --> 00:24:13.182\nIf you've done your questioning right and\nthey understand your product and\n\n531\n00:24:13.182 --> 00:24:16.409\nservice a little bit or not a little\nbit a lot, they've done their research,\n\n532\n00:24:16.409 --> 00:24:20.002\ntheir homework and maybe you've given them\nsome stuff to look at before the meeting.\n\n533\n00:24:20.002 --> 00:24:24.590\nIf they understand that again, 90% of the\ntime, they're gonna purchase from you or\n\n534\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.260\nthey're gonna tell you\nwhat they think they need.\n\n535\n00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.280\nAnd then in the last one,\nthe S which is solutions.\n\n536\n00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.561\nThat's when you get to talk.\n\n537\n00:24:32.561 --> 00:24:36.323\nAfter they've told you what they think\nthey need, you get to tell them how your\n\n538\n00:24:36.323 --> 00:24:39.235\nproduct or service will exactly\nmeet those needs if at well.\n\n539\n00:24:39.235 --> 00:24:40.223\nSo here, let's go over it again.\n\n540\n00:24:40.223 --> 00:24:44.570\nI ask situation questions to kinda\nunderstand what's going on with them in\n\n541\n00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:45.401\ntheir world.\n\n542\n00:24:45.401 --> 00:24:50.353\nWhether it's a B2B or a B2C sale,\nsituation questions say,\n\n543\n00:24:50.353 --> 00:24:53.443\nwhat's happening with you right now?\n\n544\n00:24:53.443 --> 00:24:54.363\nWhat's going wrong?\n\n545\n00:24:54.363 --> 00:24:56.140\nWhat opportunities would you\nlike to take advantage of?\n\n546\n00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.287\nBoom, then the next one, challenges.\n\n547\n00:24:58.287 --> 00:25:00.520\nNow, let's dig in and\nget as many of these as we can.\n\n548\n00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.589\nThese are what I call targets.\n\n549\n00:25:01.589 --> 00:25:04.347\nIf you only find one problem or\none opportunity,\n\n550\n00:25:04.347 --> 00:25:06.306\nyou only have one thing to sell to.\n\n551\n00:25:06.306 --> 00:25:10.494\nIf you find a couple problems,\na few challenges, a few opportunities,\n\n552\n00:25:10.494 --> 00:25:13.805\neach one of those now becomes a target for\nme to add value.\n\n553\n00:25:13.805 --> 00:25:18.443\nSo by uncovering multiple issues,\nmultiple problems, multiple opportunities,\n\n554\n00:25:18.443 --> 00:25:20.346\nI have multiple ways to add value.\n\n555\n00:25:20.346 --> 00:25:21.716\nIt's not just price.\n\n556\n00:25:21.716 --> 00:25:22.797\nIt's not just one thing.\n\n557\n00:25:22.797 --> 00:25:25.797\nI want five or six or\nseven targets to shoot at.\n\n558\n00:25:25.797 --> 00:25:28.100\nSo if I miss one of the targets,\nI hit a bullseye on the next one.\n\n559\n00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:28.844\nI miss the next one.\n\n560\n00:25:28.844 --> 00:25:30.894\nI had a bullseye I just got on the board.\n\n561\n00:25:30.894 --> 00:25:32.780\nNow, I have two strong places to sell.\n\n562\n00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.639\nOn the third one,\nit's gonna add a little bit more value.\n\n563\n00:25:35.639 --> 00:25:38.077\nInstead of trying to sell on one and\nbam, it gets shot down.\n\n564\n00:25:38.077 --> 00:25:40.920\nI missed the target and my sale is over.\n\n565\n00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.240\nMy appointments,\nI got nothing else to talk about.\n\n566\n00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.012\nSo we got situation questions,\nchallenge questions.\n\n567\n00:25:46.012 --> 00:25:48.850\nNext one, brutally important,\ncost questions.\n\n568\n00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.774\nQuantify the problem.\n\n569\n00:25:50.774 --> 00:25:54.149\nQuantify the opportunity and\nget the customers to give you the numbers.\n\n570\n00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:56.166\nThe next one is customer needs.\n\n571\n00:25:56.166 --> 00:25:57.948\nWhat do you think Mr. or Mrs.\n\n572\n00:25:57.948 --> 00:26:01.451\nCustomer, client,\nit will take to solve your problems.\n\n573\n00:26:01.451 --> 00:26:02.665\nHow would you like to fix this?\n\n574\n00:26:02.665 --> 00:26:04.074\nWhat do you think you need?\n\n575\n00:26:04.074 --> 00:26:05.648\nAnd they explain that.\n\n576\n00:26:05.648 --> 00:26:06.660\nNow finally,\n\n577\n00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:11.896\nthe last S solutions where you get to\ntalk about your product and service.\n\n578\n00:26:11.896 --> 00:26:13.135\nLet me reiterate this idea.\n\n579\n00:26:13.135 --> 00:26:14.141\nWho talks first?\n\n580\n00:26:14.141 --> 00:26:14.693\nThey do.\n\n581\n00:26:14.693 --> 00:26:16.073\nThey tell you about their situation.\n\n582\n00:26:16.073 --> 00:26:16.921\nWho talks second?\n\n583\n00:26:16.921 --> 00:26:17.936\nThey do.\n\n584\n00:26:17.936 --> 00:26:19.537\nThey tell you about your challenges and\nopportunities.\n\n585\n00:26:19.537 --> 00:26:20.416\nWho talks third?\n\n586\n00:26:20.416 --> 00:26:21.134\nThey do.\n\n587\n00:26:21.134 --> 00:26:25.128\nThey talk about the costs, the\nimplications of not solving the problems\n\n588\n00:26:25.128 --> 00:26:28.153\nor being able to take advantage\nof the opportunities.\n\n589\n00:26:28.153 --> 00:26:28.872\nWho talks next?\n\n590\n00:26:28.872 --> 00:26:29.968\nThey do.\n\n591\n00:26:29.968 --> 00:26:31.952\nThey tell you about what\nthey think they need.\n\n592\n00:26:31.952 --> 00:26:37.272\nNow and only now are you fully prepared\nto take everything they've told you and\n\n593\n00:26:37.272 --> 00:26:42.672\ncustom tailor exactly write your pitch,\nyour explanation of your products and\n\n594\n00:26:42.672 --> 00:26:48.151\nservices, so that you're not just throwing\na bunch of stuff against the wall and\n\n595\n00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:49.462\nhoping it sticks.\n\n596\n00:26:49.462 --> 00:26:52.084\nYou're not telling them about all\nof your features and benefits, and\n\n597\n00:26:52.084 --> 00:26:54.140\nhoping that one of them is what they want.\n\n598\n00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.970\nYou're only telling them about the most\nimportant things that they have explicitly\n\n599\n00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.790\ntold you they need,\nthey want to solve specific problems or\n\n600\n00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.450\ntake advantage of opportunities and\n\n601\n00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:07.690\nhow much it costs if they don't do that\nwhich allows you to understand and\n\n602\n00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:12.320\nshow the value of your solution compared\nto the costs you've already discussed.\n\n603\n00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.795\nThis is a big, big idea and it's\nthe reverse of the way, unfortunately,\n\n604\n00:27:15.795 --> 00:27:16.981\nmany sales people do it.\n\n605\n00:27:16.981 --> 00:27:21.581\nThey go in and start blurting out\nproducts, features, benefits,\n\n606\n00:27:21.581 --> 00:27:26.436\nsales opportunities, deadlines,\nspecial pricing, immediately.\n\n607\n00:27:26.436 --> 00:27:27.633\nNow let me tell you, open up their laptop.\n\n608\n00:27:27.633 --> 00:27:30.901\nLet me tell you about the history of\nour company and where we've been, and\n\n609\n00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:33.875\nhow many people we have working for\nus, and all this other stuff.\n\n610\n00:27:33.875 --> 00:27:35.955\nYou know what the customer's saying\nin their head the whole time?\n\n611\n00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:37.645\nSo what, I don't care.\n\n612\n00:27:37.645 --> 00:27:38.400\nI don't care about you.\n\n613\n00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.006\nYou know what?\n\n614\n00:27:39.006 --> 00:27:39.727\nI care about me.\n\n615\n00:27:39.727 --> 00:27:40.721\nI love me some me.\n\n616\n00:27:40.721 --> 00:27:42.595\nTalk to me about me.\n\n617\n00:27:42.595 --> 00:27:45.804\nHelp me not tell me about you.\n\n618\n00:27:45.804 --> 00:27:49.043\nI don't care about the history\nof your company per se.\n\n619\n00:27:49.043 --> 00:27:52.014\nI mean, if it's a long history and\nyou've been around and you're trustworthy,\n\n620\n00:27:52.014 --> 00:27:52.581\nthat's nice.\n\n621\n00:27:52.581 --> 00:27:57.457\nBut I'd prefer that you spent most\nof the meeting asking me questions,\n\n622\n00:27:57.457 --> 00:28:01.041\nhelping me,\nhelping you to understand what I need.\n\n623\n00:28:01.041 --> 00:28:01.872\nLet me tell you that.\n\n624\n00:28:01.872 --> 00:28:02.644\nLet me talk.\n\n625\n00:28:02.644 --> 00:28:05.649\nLet me share everything and\nthen after I do that,\n\n626\n00:28:05.649 --> 00:28:09.500\nI'd like you to tell me\nexactly how you can help me.\n\n627\n00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.566\nThat is the power in this and\nthis again is all based on spin selling.\n\n628\n00:28:13.566 --> 00:28:16.782\nBy Neil Rackham, I just changed it\na little bit to work for me, but\n\n629\n00:28:16.782 --> 00:28:20.894\nI think you absolutely have to read that\nbook, study that book, work on that book.\n\n630\n00:28:20.894 --> 00:28:23.088\nAnd then like me,\ncustomize it to yourself.\n\n631\n00:28:23.088 --> 00:28:26.082\nAnd after you've practiced it enough,\nit becomes natural.\n\n632\n00:28:26.082 --> 00:28:27.356\nAnd the way I like to look at it,\n\n633\n00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:30.930\nthis is just like if you talk to one of\nyour friends who is having a problem.\n\n634\n00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.200\nSo tell me what's going on, Scott.\n\n635\n00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.307\nThat's interesting.\n\n636\n00:28:34.307 --> 00:28:35.916\nWow, it sounds like that\nmight be challenging.\n\n637\n00:28:35.916 --> 00:28:37.545\nWhat problems or\nchallenges do you see in that?\n\n638\n00:28:37.545 --> 00:28:38.694\nThat's bad, man.\n\n639\n00:28:38.694 --> 00:28:40.541\nIf you don't fix that what could happen?\n\n640\n00:28:40.541 --> 00:28:43.990\nThat would really be ugly.\n\n641\n00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.930\nWhat do you think it's\ngonna take to fix that man?\n\n642\n00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:47.598\nHow can I help you?\n\n643\n00:28:47.598 --> 00:28:48.327\nYou're one of my friends.\n\n644\n00:28:48.327 --> 00:28:51.245\nWhat can I do to help you now or\nlet me help by doing this or\n\n645\n00:28:51.245 --> 00:28:54.480\nit's basically the way you talk\nto somebody you care about,\n\n646\n00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.963\nabout a problem,\nan issue or an opportunity.\n\n647\n00:28:56.963 --> 00:29:00.126\nHow you gonna help them, but\nyou let them talk the whole time, so\n\n648\n00:29:00.126 --> 00:29:01.249\nyou show tat you care.\n\n649\n00:29:01.249 --> 00:29:02.350\nYou show that you are interested.\n\n650\n00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:06.753\nYou show that you have best interest\nheart before you open up your mouth and\n\n651\n00:29:06.753 --> 00:29:08.325\ntry to solve the problem.\n\n652\n00:29:08.325 --> 00:29:11.797\nNow here is another tool that\nwasn't in Spence selling, but\n\n653\n00:29:11.797 --> 00:29:15.203\nI think takes this idea of question\nto a whole other level and\n\n654\n00:29:15.203 --> 00:29:19.379\nit's the idea of an agenda and\na lot of sales people don't like agendas.\n\n655\n00:29:19.379 --> 00:29:20.270\nThey think it's too formal.\n\n656\n00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.429\nIt will make the customer uncomfortable.\n\n657\n00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:25.928\nIt all depends on what you call it and\nhow you present it.\n\n658\n00:29:25.928 --> 00:29:27.752\nYou can call it a list of topics to cover.\n\n659\n00:29:27.752 --> 00:29:33.022\nSome stuff we need to talk about,\nour agenda, whatever you want to call it.\n\n660\n00:29:33.022 --> 00:29:33.940\nA needs analysis.\n\n661\n00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.130\nThat's what I like to call it when\nI'm meeting with a new client.\n\n662\n00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:41.538\nI've taken the liberty of putting together\na few sections around a needs analysis, so\n\n663\n00:29:41.538 --> 00:29:46.723\nI can really understand your business very\nwell before I can understand if I can help\n\n664\n00:29:46.723 --> 00:29:51.782\nyou and what you do with the agenda is you\nmake it line up perfectly with the SCCCS.\n\n665\n00:29:51.782 --> 00:29:54.163\nFirst thing on the agenda,\nsituation, you just put it there.\n\n666\n00:29:54.163 --> 00:29:58.250\nSituation, colon, what is currently\nhappening in your business as it relates\n\n667\n00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:59.906\nto marketing and advertising?\n\n668\n00:29:59.906 --> 00:30:02.844\nAnd I'm using that example,\ncuz I used to own a marketing company.\n\n669\n00:30:02.844 --> 00:30:05.001\nSo situation, Smith Homes.\n\n670\n00:30:05.001 --> 00:30:09.654\nWhat's happening right now around\nmarketing and advertising?\n\n671\n00:30:09.654 --> 00:30:10.444\nNext C, challenges.\n\n672\n00:30:10.444 --> 00:30:11.784\nYou write it right there.\n\n673\n00:30:11.784 --> 00:30:15.680\nChallenges colon, what potential\nchallenges slash problems or\n\n674\n00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.749\nopportunities?\n\n675\n00:30:16.749 --> 00:30:21.740\nAre now impacting Smith Homes.\n\n676\n00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:22.294\nThere it is.\n\n677\n00:30:22.294 --> 00:30:25.558\nThe next one, boom,\nbig capital, costs, colon.\n\n678\n00:30:25.558 --> 00:30:29.275\nWhat are the costs associated\nwith these problems and\n\n679\n00:30:29.275 --> 00:30:33.980\nopportunities or problems,\nchallenges and opportunities?\n\n680\n00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:37.419\nBam, next one, customer needs.\n\n681\n00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:38.470\nJust put it needs right there.\n\n682\n00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:43.358\nWhat do you feel or what does\nthe management team of Smith Homes is\n\n683\n00:30:43.358 --> 00:30:47.250\nnecessary to fix these problems and\nchallenges and\n\n684\n00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.248\ntake advantage of the opportunities?\n\n685\n00:30:50.248 --> 00:30:52.821\nAnd then S, suggested solution.\n\n686\n00:30:52.821 --> 00:30:57.465\nColon, John will share with you\nhis best ideas on how you can take\n\n687\n00:30:57.465 --> 00:31:01.956\nadvantage of these opportunities and\nsolve these problems.\n\n688\n00:31:01.956 --> 00:31:04.756\nAnd it might be, that might have been\na little bit more wordy than you would\n\n689\n00:31:04.756 --> 00:31:05.943\nwrite, but here's the idea.\n\n690\n00:31:05.943 --> 00:31:07.703\nYou create that it goes\nright down the thing.\n\n691\n00:31:07.703 --> 00:31:09.936\nI mean, right down the model.\n\n692\n00:31:09.936 --> 00:31:13.074\nAnd when you come into the meeting,\nyou say, Mr.\n\n693\n00:31:13.074 --> 00:31:17.129\nGordon, I really appreciate you\ngiving me a little bit of time.\n\n694\n00:31:17.129 --> 00:31:20.679\nI know you're very busy and in order\nto not waste a minute of your time,\n\n695\n00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:24.893\nI've taken the liberty of putting together\nsort of an outline of things I thought we\n\n696\n00:31:24.893 --> 00:31:28.806\ncould cover today to make sure that I\naddress what's most important to you and\n\n697\n00:31:28.806 --> 00:31:32.539\nI can give you my absolute best\nrecommendations whether it's our product\n\n698\n00:31:32.539 --> 00:31:35.046\nor one of our competitors products or\nservices.\n\n699\n00:31:35.046 --> 00:31:38.962\nThe best recommendation\nI can to help you today.\n\n700\n00:31:38.962 --> 00:31:41.359\nAnd now I've taken the pressure off and\nthen you say,\n\n701\n00:31:41.359 --> 00:31:44.234\nall right and you still hold it and\nyou maybe look at them and say,\n\n702\n00:31:44.234 --> 00:31:47.535\nI'd like you to take a few minutes here\nand tell me sort of about the general\n\n703\n00:31:47.535 --> 00:31:51.369\nsituation in your company right now as it\nrelates to marketing and advertising, then\n\n704\n00:31:51.369 --> 00:31:55.309\nI'd like you to share with me if you feel\ncomfortable the challenges, opportunities,\n\n705\n00:31:55.309 --> 00:31:58.544\nproblems you're facing that you think\nI might be able to help you with.\n\n706\n00:31:58.544 --> 00:32:00.748\nThe next thing and\nthis is really important,\n\n707\n00:32:00.748 --> 00:32:04.696\nI wanna understand How big these problems\nor opportunities are to your company.\n\n708\n00:32:04.696 --> 00:32:07.709\nSo I'd really like to work with\nyou to kind of quantify, so\n\n709\n00:32:07.709 --> 00:32:11.860\nI could understand the scope of\nwhat's going on in your business.\n\n710\n00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.900\nAfter that, I'd love it if\nyou'd take a few minutes and\n\n711\n00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.490\nshare with me what solutions\nyou've already looked at.\n\n712\n00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.560\nWhat have you and your team discussed\nalready that you think you need to fix\n\n713\n00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.000\nthis problem or\ntake advantage of this opportunity.\n\n714\n00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.910\nAnd then after I've heard all that and\nasked you a bunch of questions,\n\n715\n00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.650\nvery focused questions.\n\n716\n00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.470\nI will have enough\nunderstanding of your business\n\n717\n00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:33.250\nto be able to make a thoughtful and\nwell-reasoned recommendation.\n\n718\n00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.460\nDoes that sound like it would be\na good way to run this meeting?\n\n719\n00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.840\nAnd also you can put a couple\nblank lines and say and\n\n720\n00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.750\nif there's anything else you'd like\nto add, we can add that right now.\n\n721\n00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:45.495\nAnd if they put price, you go absolutely,\nI know that's critical to you.\n\n722\n00:32:45.495 --> 00:32:49.090\nThen we're definitely gonna cover that,\nbut I can't tell you\n\n723\n00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:52.880\na reasonable guess at a price until\nwe've covered all this other stuff.\n\n724\n00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.940\nOnce we've covered the other stuff,\nI will be able to tell you exactly what I\n\n725\n00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.010\nthink it'll take to solve your\nproblems and exactly what it'll cost.\n\n726\n00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:02.320\nAnd so would it be all right if we\njust left that to the last item.\n\n727\n00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.520\nDo you know I wanna talk about it now,\none of two things happens.\n\n728\n00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.820\nThey've already made\nthe decision they wanna buy,\n\n729\n00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.520\nthey wanna buy from you this to wanna\nmake sure that they can afford it.\n\n730\n00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.170\nOr number two, they'd just gonna worry\nabout price and nothing else and\n\n731\n00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.970\nthat's the good time to say,\nthank you so much, I have to go.\n\n732\n00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:19.770\nWhich brings me to a really\nimportant idea, lose early!!!\n\n733\n00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:24.740\nYou should identify what an A client\nlooks like, you're ideal customer.\n\n734\n00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.210\nSomebody who appreciates\nwhat you bring to the table,\n\n735\n00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:30.020\nhas a problem that you can solve.\n\n736\n00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.380\nYou have the exact right solution,\nyou have it at a reasonable price,\n\n737\n00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.630\nthey're not gonna argue with price.\n\n738\n00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:35.820\nThey'll be easy to work with.\n\n739\n00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.100\nThey have the chance to be\na long term customer and\n\n740\n00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.980\nthey have the chance\nto give you referrals.\n\n741\n00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.600\nYou should have a really good overview of\nwhat somebody like that looks like and\n\n742\n00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.680\nspend the vast majority of your\ntime selling to people like that.\n\n743\n00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.230\nBut if you get in front of somebody\nthat doesn't meet those criteria,\n\n744\n00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:53.790\nthe best thing you do is refer them\nimmediately to your worst competition.\n\n745\n00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:54.980\nAnd I'm not kidding.\n\n746\n00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.500\nSend them off, take the problem child and\n\n747\n00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.450\nsend them off to your worst competition\nand let them deal with those headaches.\n\n748\n00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:03.030\nSo that you can lose early and\nmove on to someone who will buy from you,\n\n749\n00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:05.720\nwho will be a great client and\nnot waste a lot of time.\n\n750\n00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.990\nAnd I see a lot of sales people say I'm\njust gonna work on this account until\n\n751\n00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:10.320\nI sell it or I'm gonna work.\n\n752\n00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.060\nAnd five years later\nthey're still busy and\n\n753\n00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.200\nthey're still going they\nhaven't sold anything.\n\n754\n00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.910\nLose early, get out of there, so you can\ngo spend time in front of good clients.\n\n755\n00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:22.220\nThe last two sections are listening and\ntaking great notes.\n\n756\n00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.070\nAnd they're gonna be much shorter.\n\n757\n00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.220\nListening is critical.\n\n758\n00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.150\nIf you ask a great question and\n\n759\n00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:30.395\nyou don't listen, what you've just\ntold the customer is I don't care.\n\n760\n00:34:30.395 --> 00:34:32.040\n[LAUGH] I'm trying to manipulate you.\n\n761\n00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.380\nI'm asking all these great questions,\nbut I'm not writing anything down or\n\n762\n00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.240\nlistening to you.\n\n763\n00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.460\nSo I won't be able to tell\nwhat you actually said.\n\n764\n00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.200\nSo you've got to be and listen to\nthis carefully, an intense listener.\n\n765\n00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.550\nYou've got to listen to every word.\n\n766\n00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:47.000\nYou've got to listen to see if their\ngetting emotional or frustrated or angry.\n\n767\n00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.850\nYou've got to hear what\nthey're not saying.\n\n768\n00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:53.160\nSo you've got to be able to focus in on\nthat person and block everything else out.\n\n769\n00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.940\nAnd make them the most important person\nin the world while you're sitting in\n\n770\n00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.710\nfront of them talking to them.\n\n771\n00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.800\nTwo ideas about how to do that better.\n\n772\n00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.870\nThe first one is if you're selling\na fairly expensive product or\n\n773\n00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:07.310\nservice something that's gonna\nrequire a pretty big investment.\n\n774\n00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:08.650\nWhat I challenge you to do is sit down and\n\n775\n00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:13.580\nthink about how much time do you actually\nspend in front of the decision maker.\n\n776\n00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.540\nIs it a couple of minutes?\n\n777\n00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.440\nIs it an hour?\n\n778\n00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.880\nIs it a couple of hours?\n\n779\n00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.540\nThen take that and divide it into the\namount of money they're gonna spend and\n\n780\n00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.340\nfigure out what it's worth per minute\nyou're sitting in front of them.\n\n781\n00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.510\nSo figure out what the value\nis of every minute or\n\n782\n00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:30.400\nevery hour you're actually in front\nof someone who can buy from you.\n\n783\n00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.200\nAnd help keep that number in your head, so\n\n784\n00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.150\nthat you realize this is important,\nthere's a lot of money on the line here.\n\n785\n00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:38.500\nI need to be fully focus\ncuz if I mess this up,\n\n786\n00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.681\nI could lose hundreds of thousands\nof dollars of revenue and\n\n787\n00:35:41.681 --> 00:35:45.516\nit's not just worth that, I want to\nclose this deal, I need to listen.\n\n788\n00:35:45.516 --> 00:35:47.303\nThe second one is one\nI learned in college,\n\n789\n00:35:47.303 --> 00:35:50.300\nwhere I would have sitting in a class,\nlistening to the professor.\n\n790\n00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.200\nIn order to deeply hear what they\nwere saying so, I could remember it.\n\n791\n00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.890\nI would block all\nthe chatter out of my head\n\n792\n00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:59.330\nby repeating what they were\nsaying over and over again.\n\n793\n00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:00.990\nSo okay, the professor's talking about A.\n\n794\n00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.575\nTalking about A, A, A, A.\n\n795\n00:36:02.575 --> 00:36:04.139\nOkay, now he's talking about B.\n\n796\n00:36:04.139 --> 00:36:05.590\nTalking about B, B, B, B.\n\n797\n00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:06.580\nA and B, A and C.\n\n798\n00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.506\nOkay, now C.\n\n799\n00:36:07.506 --> 00:36:09.942\nC is the most important\nthing in this equation, so\n\n800\n00:36:09.942 --> 00:36:11.510\nC is really the most important.\n\n801\n00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.310\nThen it's A, then it's B.\n\n802\n00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:18.870\nC, A, B, C or CAB, okay, I got this now,\nI understand because here's what happens.\n\n803\n00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.610\nYour brain can go way faster\nthan people can talk.\n\n804\n00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:22.648\nEven as fast as I talk.\n\n805\n00:36:22.648 --> 00:36:27.600\nWhich means there's about four times\nthe capacity to listen as the actual words\n\n806\n00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.770\ncoming at you.\n\n807\n00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:32.905\nAnd if you don't listen carefully,\nthat other 300% is\n\n808\n00:36:32.905 --> 00:36:35.795\njust flying around thinking about,\nwhat am I gonna do after this?\n\n809\n00:36:35.795 --> 00:36:36.875\nWhere am I gonna go for lunch?\n\n810\n00:36:36.875 --> 00:36:38.805\nI gotta pick up some\ngroceries on the way home.\n\n811\n00:36:38.805 --> 00:36:40.875\nMy kid's got a soccer game this weekend.\n\n812\n00:36:40.875 --> 00:36:43.185\nI hope I can play golf with\nmy buddies this weekend.\n\n813\n00:36:43.185 --> 00:36:45.165\nAll that other stuff is rumbling\naround in your head and\n\n814\n00:36:45.165 --> 00:36:48.375\nyou're trying among all of that\nto listen to the customer.\n\n815\n00:36:48.375 --> 00:36:52.240\nNo, replace all of that with repeating and\n\n816\n00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.340\ntrying to deeply understand\nwhat the customer is saying.\n\n817\n00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.770\nAgain, this is something you practice.\n\n818\n00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:59.470\nBut when you become good at it,\nyou can block out the entire world and\n\n819\n00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:00.850\nthe only sound you hear.\n\n820\n00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:04.250\nThe only thing you're doing is interacting\nwith the client, listening to them,\n\n821\n00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.870\nwatching their body language.\n\n822\n00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:09.390\nListening for key words, key phrases,\nthings that'll give you hints\n\n823\n00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:13.560\nabout their problems, their challenges,\ntheir fears, their frustrations.\n\n824\n00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.918\nThe joy,\nwhatever they want to have happen and\n\n825\n00:37:15.918 --> 00:37:19.130\nall of that is essential to\nbeing able to close the deal.\n\n826\n00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:23.800\nLastly, after you've been insanely\ncurious and asked expert questions.\n\n827\n00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.700\nYou've been an intense listener that's\nhighly focused, you must, must,\n\n828\n00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.840\nmust take excellent notes.\n\n829\n00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.770\nYou've gotta work on taking not shorthand,\nbut quick words, quick ideas.\n\n830\n00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:37.600\nAnd then what I do is when\nI'm writing a note and\n\n831\n00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.080\nsomeone says and this is really important.\n\n832\n00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.360\nI put a couple stars next to it and\nthen I circle it.\n\n833\n00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.680\nIn fact, I'm gonna tell you\nthree key things that I want.\n\n834\n00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.261\nI put a big one zero and then when\nI write it, I mean a big one dot.\n\n835\n00:37:48.261 --> 00:37:50.050\nAnd then when I write it,\nI put a big star next to it.\n\n836\n00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:52.380\nAnd then they might tell me some\nmore stuff, write a few more lines.\n\n837\n00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.910\nI go number two and\nI put a two with a big star next to it.\n\n838\n00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:58.630\nAnd then when they end talking, I can\nsay I've listened to you very carefully.\n\n839\n00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.580\nI've taken some good notes here.\n\n840\n00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.670\nLet me take a second and\ngo ahead and go back over what and\n\n841\n00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.380\ntell me if I missed anything.\n\n842\n00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.520\nYou've told me there was three\nthings that were important.\n\n843\n00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.840\nThe first thing was XYZ and you said\nunder that, it's around market share,\n\n844\n00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:18.140\npenetration of new markets and\ntargeting the right ideal client.\n\n845\n00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.300\nThen the second thing you\nsaid was around team work.\n\n846\n00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.440\nAnd you needed to get your marketing\nteam working closer together and\n\n847\n00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.990\nmore communication,\na higher level of trust.\n\n848\n00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:29.500\nThen the third thing you talked\nabout was doing a client panel,\n\n849\n00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.990\na client advisory panel.\n\n850\n00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:34.270\nSo you could own the voice of the customer\nand understand your customers better.\n\n851\n00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:37.760\nAs I look at these three things, I see\nthat they're all critical but you and\n\n852\n00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.460\nI both agree for\nat least from what you said.\n\n853\n00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:43.470\nIt seems very clear to me that you've\ngotta do that customer panel first\n\n854\n00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:44.580\nbefore you can do the other two.\n\n855\n00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.270\nDoes that sound about\nwhat you shared with me?\n\n856\n00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:48.950\nAm I fairly close to on target here?\n\n857\n00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.870\nI have been doing this for years and\nyears and years with my clients.\n\n858\n00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.390\nAnd when you can go back and\n\n859\n00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.420\ngive them a summary of everything\nthey've said, they're impressed.\n\n860\n00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.840\nWhen you can summarize it and paraphrase\nit, in other words, explain it and\n\n861\n00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.600\nthen use it in your own language.\n\n862\n00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.600\nIn a way you describe it and\n\n863\n00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.760\nhave the customer go yep, that's\nexactly what I'm focused on, perfect.\n\n864\n00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.640\nThat's when you go and\nthis is what I say to my clients,\n\n865\n00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.920\ngood, I love perfect,\nthat's what I wanted.\n\n866\n00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.610\nSo if these are the three problems and\n\n867\n00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.060\nnow I can start talk about\nhow I will handle them.\n\n868\n00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:21.310\nAnother quick idea on this too is as\nsoon as I get off the phone or out\n\n869\n00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.900\nof a meeting with a customer and they've\ngiven me that list and we've discussed it.\n\n870\n00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:29.420\nWe've talked about all their stuff and\nwhat I'm gonna do, I immediately before I\n\n871\n00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.610\ndo anything else, type out a memo or\ntalk it to my voice recognition.\n\n872\n00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:39.320\nI use Dragon Naturally Speaking and\nI dictate a recap of the call immediately.\n\n873\n00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.000\nThen I get someone on my team to clean\nit up, make sure I spelled it right and\n\n874\n00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.150\neverything and then we send it\nto the client as fast as we can.\n\n875\n00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.400\nAnd again,\nconfirm is this what we discussed.\n\n876\n00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.800\nHave i covered the most important points?\n\n877\n00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.450\nDoes my recommendation make sense to\nyou and we agreed on these next steps.\n\n878\n00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:00.820\nVery professional way to handle it and\nI've got those files going back 15 years.\n\n879\n00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:07.180\nI literally this week had a client called\nme who I hadn't worked with in 12 years.\n\n880\n00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.810\nBut they bought a couple new companies,\nthey've got some new people on staff,\n\n881\n00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:11.570\nthey need some more training.\n\n882\n00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:15.540\nWe actually had the files,\nthe slide deck, the workbook and\n\n883\n00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:18.570\nall my notes from my\ncalls from 12 years ago.\n\n884\n00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:22.210\nSo when I got on the call\nyesterday to talk to them,\n\n885\n00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.570\nI was able to reiterate what\nwe covered the last time.\n\n886\n00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.300\nWho was in the room,\nwhat the most important issues were,\n\n887\n00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.130\nwhat I covered in the slides,\nwhat we covered in the workbook.\n\n888\n00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.990\nAnd they were totally blown away, how in\nthe world, John, do you know all this?\n\n889\n00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:37.410\nAnd it's very simple, because you're\nimportant to me, you're a client,\n\n890\n00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:39.600\nI try to do the best job I can for you.\n\n891\n00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.680\nAnd part of that is is I\nkeep all the files and\n\n892\n00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.910\nall the records, so I know exactly\nwhat I've delivered for you.\n\n893\n00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.770\nSo I don't cover the exact same thing or\n\n894\n00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:49.830\nwe can talk about the most\nimportant things.\n\n895\n00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:53.740\nSo this next training program I deliver\nfor you will also be a home run.\n\n896\n00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.590\nSo let me wrap this all up.\n\n897\n00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:59.620\nI believe that for you to be a trusted\nadvisor, a true consultative salesperson.\n\n898\n00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:05.290\nIt is critical, absolutely critical\nthat you ask great questions,\n\n899\n00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:08.510\nyou're an intense listener and\nyou take super good notes.\n\n900\n00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.360\nIf you can't do those three things really,\n\n901\n00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.540\nreally well, it will dramatically\ndecrease your success as a salesperson.\n\n902\n00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:18.100\nSo work on these things, none of\nthis is stuff you can do on the fly.\n\n903\n00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.900\nAll of it takes practice,\nall of it takes preparation.\n\n904\n00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.020\nYou gotta sit down, take some time out,\nwork on the questions.\n\n905\n00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.630\nWork on your listening skills with people\nin your office or with your clients.\n\n906\n00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:28.940\nWork on taking notes.\n\n907\n00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:32.598\nAnd as you get better,and better and\nbetter, you're going to see more and\n\n908\n00:41:32.598 --> 00:41:33.361\nmore success.\n\n909\n00:41:33.361 --> 00:41:38.260\n[BLANK AUDIO]\n\n",

unrelated but\n\n3\n00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.850\nstill very powerful ideas about how\nto be truly successful in sales.\n\n4\n00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.240\nFirst thing I want to talk\nabout is objection handling.\n\n5\n00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.600\nBig topic, important topic.\n\n6\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.690\nThere are a million different ways that\npeople teach you to handle objections.\n\n7\n00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.400\nThe classic one is feel, felt, found.\n\n8\n00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.850\nWhen someone gives you an objection,\nyou go, I understand how you feel.\n\n9\n00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.830\nMany of my other customers\nhave felt the same way, but\n\n10\n00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.200\nwhat they've found, and that's nice,\nbut it's rote, and it's a technique.\n\n11\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.181\nAnd if anyone has been around very long,\n\n12\n00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:40.480\nthey're gonna see through\nthat really quick.\n\n13\n00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.950\nMy solution for being truly world\nclass at handling objections\n\n14\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.310\nis extremely simple but\nincredibly hard to do.\n\n15\n00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.790\nHere it is, think of the top three, four,\nfive objections you get all the time.\n\n16\n00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.280\nThe ones you know you're gonna get and\nthen sit down and write out an extremely\n\n17\n00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.590\nprofessional, focused, reasonable and\nrealistic answer that is so\n\n18\n00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.020\ntight, so focused that the customer\nlooks at you and says.\n\n19\n00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.420\nWow, now that you put it that way,\nI understand it completely, and\n\n20\n00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.720\nit just kills the objection.\n\n21\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.260\nActually, if you get good enough,\nyou can actually bring it up.\n\n22\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.930\nWhat I like to say is kill\nthe monster while it's small is say,\n\n23\n00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.010\nmany of my customers have\nbeen concerned with x, y, z.\n\n24\n00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.170\nAnd really the way I look at it is,\nand then,\n\n25\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.530\nyou give your wonderful answer\nbefore they even bring it up.\n\n26\n00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410\nI'm not saying you do that all the time.\n\n27\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.550\nBut that is a really good way to avoid the\nobjection even coming up and making sure\n\n28\n00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.670\nthat you address it and put them at ease\nbefore they have to bring up the question.\n\n29\n00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.310\nBut if they do bring up an objection,\nlet me give you an example.\n\n30\n00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.750\nOftentimes in my business, and\nmy wife handles all of our negotiations,\n\n31\n00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.170\nbecause it's hard for me to negotiate for\nmyself because I'm the product.\n\n32\n00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.178\nBut oftentimes people will\nhave some push back on price,\n\n33\n00:01:57.178 --> 00:02:02.380\nwe charge $20,000 a day for\nme to come in and give a speech.\n\n34\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.050\nOftentimes just a one hour key note.\n\n35\n00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.200\nWhat the customer will say\nwhen we tell him the prices,\n\n36\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.650\nwow, that's a lot of money for\na one hour speech.\n\n37\n00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.690\nI mean, $20,000 to talk for an hour.\n\n38\n00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.110\nWe have a number of ways to handle that\nbut my wife, Sheila, will often say,\n\n39\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.700\nthere's a couple of different things.\n\n40\n00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.080\nShe'll point out that it's not one hour,\nit's 20 years of research,\n\n41\n00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.750\nthousands of books,\nbeing the CEO of several companies and\n\n42\n00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.060\nbeing able to boil all those ideas down\nto just the best stuff in an hour.\n\n43\n00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.170\nAlso, we don't charge for an hour.\n\n44\n00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.190\nWe charge a daily rate.\n\n45\n00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.000\nShe'll explain to them that yes,\nyou're only hiring John for\n\n46\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.010\nan hour, but he's willing to work all day.\n\n47\n00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.100\nHe'll come in in the morning,\nhe'll do a breakfast meeting,\n\n48\n00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.410\nhe'll do an early speech,\nhe'll do a workshop.\n\n49\n00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.980\nAnother thing she points out is that I'm\none of the top 100 in the world at what\n\n50\n00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.200\nI do, you don't buy a premium product for\na low cost price.\n\n51\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.940\nAnd that feeds right into another way\nwe handle that objection, which is we\n\n52\n00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.340\ntell customers, you're bringing\npeople in from all over the country,\n\n53\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.220\nthis is a really important meeting.\n\n54\n00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.330\nYou're spending a ton of\nmoney on air fare, on food,\n\n55\n00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.290\ntransportation, hotel rooms,\nthe meeting hall.\n\n56\n00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.290\nThere's a lot at stake here.\n\n57\n00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.570\nIt would be a shame to\nsee all of that ruined\n\n58\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.560\nby trying to save a few thousand\nbucks on the speaker and\n\n59\n00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.120\nhaving everybody disappointed that\nthey didn't get good information.\n\n60\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.970\nSo in our business,\n\n61\n00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.480\nthat's just a few of the ways that\nwe handle the price objection.\n\n62\n00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.760\nWe sat down, we thought them through,\nwe've scripted them.\n\n63\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.130\nAnd my team, my wife knows how\nto absolutely present those in\n\n64\n00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.690\na professional, clear, focused way that\nmost clients go, wow, now that you\n\n65\n00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.410\nput it that way, that's a very reasonable\nprice for everything we're gonna get.\n\n66\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.310\nSo that's the goal, is look at\nthe different objections you get,\n\n67\n00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.946\ntake the time to workout a good answer.\n\n68\n00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:54.230\nTest it on some clients,\ntest it on colleagues,\n\n69\n00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.850\ntest it on other people in your office,\nwhoever you can get.\n\n70\n00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.720\nContinue to refine it, and refine it, and\n\n71\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.660\nrefine it, until you can say,\nthat's an excellent concern you have.\n\n72\n00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.840\nAnd really,\nwhen we look at it from our side,\n\n73\n00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.970\nthere's four things that we feel justify\nthe price of our product or service.\n\n74\n00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.770\nAnd then you go A, B, C,\nD, one, two, three, four.\n\n75\n00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.490\nExplain it and the goal is always to have\nthe client go yep, that makes sense,\n\n76\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.480\nI understand now.\n\n77\n00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.420\nNow I wanna tell you\nsort of a funny story but\n\n78\n00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.470\none that really has a lot of poignance and\nit's about upselling or cross-selling.\n\n79\n00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.640\nOne of the biggest problems I see in\na lot of organizations I see is, they\n\n80\n00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.410\nwill sell multiple product lines or they\nhave partnerships with other companies or\n\n81\n00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.180\nthey own three or\nfour companies that do different things.\n\n82\n00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.410\nAnd the sales person goes in from one\ncompany and focuses only on their product,\n\n83\n00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.180\nonly on their service and doesn't think\nabout everything that they can offer\n\n84\n00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.030\nthrough all of their multiple arms,\ndivisions, companies.\n\n85\n00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.750\nMany salesmen that I talk to and\n\n86\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.310\nCEOs are extremely displeased because\nthey're not generating enough leads and\n\n87\n00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.350\nthey're not cross-selling and bringing\nin other people from the organization.\n\n88\n00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.300\nSo I wanted to give a fun little\nstory about upselling and\n\n89\n00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.260\nalso to reiterate that idea.\n\n90\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.610\nMy wife and I go to a Chinese restaurant\nin town from time to time and we love\n\n91\n00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.130\nthe girl that works there because she has\none of the most amazing sales techniques.\n\n92\n00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.600\nYou walk in and you say, hi,\nI'd like to get some kung pao chicken.\n\n93\n00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.080\nAt first, she goes, kung pao chicken,\nlooks up and goes, and?\n\n94\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.890\nAnd you go, eggrolls.\n\n95\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:24.522\nShe goes, and?\n\n96\n00:05:24.522 --> 00:05:25.792\nWon-ton soup.\n\n97\n00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:27.600\nYeah, I can drink soup.\n\n98\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.470\nAnd she goes, and?\n\n99\n00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.980\nAnd you're like I don't need\nanything else, that's all I need,\n\n100\n00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.660\nthat's enough for dinner.\n\n101\n00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.970\nShe goes, and?\n\n102\n00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.990\nAnd you go, I could get some lunch for\n\n103\n00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.340\ntomorrow, how's about\na thing of egg foo yung.\n\n104\n00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.930\nShe will keep saying and until you really\nget to the point where there's nothing\n\n105\n00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.750\nelse you can buy, and she doesn't do it\nin a horribly pushy way, it's just fun.\n\n106\n00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.670\nBut I think it's one of\nthe greatest sales techniques.\n\n107\n00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.520\nBut what it tells even a high\nlevel consultative sales person is\n\n108\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.050\nyou don't get it if you don't ask for it.\n\n109\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.460\nYou gotta figure out what do they want.\n\n110\n00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.420\nIs there anything else?\n\n111\n00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.435\nCan I cross-sell them, upsell them?\n\n112\n00:06:01.435 --> 00:06:04.066\nAgain, not to sell them more stuff, but\n\n113\n00:06:04.066 --> 00:06:06.970\nto make sure that you get\nthem everything they need,\n\n114\n00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.300\neverything that will fix their problem or\ntheir problems or their opportunities.\n\n115\n00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.780\nMultiple ones might be multiple products,\nmultiple divisions,\n\n116\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.000\nmultiple people from your company.\n\n117\n00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.640\nSo, always keep that in mind and\nalways ask and.\n\n118\n00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.400\nNext thing I want to talk\nabout is an idea that we\n\n119\n00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.820\nchatted out earlier with lose early and\nthe fact that time is money.\n\n120\n00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.800\nAll the time you spend in front of\na client where you're not closing the deal\n\n121\n00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.610\nis time you're not in front of an ideal\nclient who would buy from you.\n\n122\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.320\nThis came from a real good friend of mine,\nJack Malcom who's one of the top sales\n\n123\n00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.000\ntrainers in the country, if not the world\nand he's got it real clear and here it is.\n\n124\n00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.020\nIf they've got a problem and\nyou have the exact right solution, and\n\n125\n00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.150\nyou can't close the deal,\nyou're talking to the wrong person.\n\n126\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.960\nThat means you don't understand\nthe decision making process.\n\n127\n00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.680\nYou're caught too low in the organization,\nyou're talking to the wrong person.\n\n128\n00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.940\nHere's the way to think about this,\n\n129\n00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.900\nespecially as our high level trusted\nadvisor, consultative sales person,\n\n130\n00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.220\nyou need to be as high in\nthe organization as you can get.\n\n131\n00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.140\nPeople at the top of the organization,\nthey make the budget.\n\n132\n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.960\nPeople down here, they have a budget.\n\n133\n00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.340\nThey're restricted on\nhow much they can spend.\n\n134\n00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.290\nThey're pretty much unrestricted\non how much they can spend, or\n\n135\n00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.150\nthey can create new revenue.\n\n136\n00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.940\nThey can take things\nfrom other departments.\n\n137\n00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.530\nIf you really know they have a serious\nproblem or a serious opportunity and\n\n138\n00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.688\nyo really know you have the absolute best\nsolution and the deal is dragging and\n\n139\n00:07:32.688 --> 00:07:37.690\nit's not closing, backup and\nlook at the decision making matrix.\n\n140\n00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.440\nLook at who's gonna really make that and\n\n141\n00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.370\nthen if you position yourself well enough,\nyou can ask the kind of questions\n\n142\n00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.900\nthat will force the person you're\ntalking to to take it to another level.\n\n143\n00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.016\nYou can ask strategy questions,\nbudget questions, about other divisions,\n\n144\n00:07:52.016 --> 00:07:55.459\nabout new companies they're gonna buy,\nabout going offshore.\n\n145\n00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:59.510\nWhatever it might be, but if you can ask a\nquestion that's basically above the level\n\n146\n00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.907\nor the pay grade of\nthe person you're talking to,\n\n147\n00:08:01.907 --> 00:08:06.016\nThey're gonna have to introduce you up,\nand hopefully they'll be your champion and\n\n148\n00:08:06.016 --> 00:08:09.298\nthey'll be carrying your flag and\nwanna bring you up and look good.\n\n149\n00:08:09.298 --> 00:08:13.093\nIf you can't do that, if they won't do it,\nyou probably have to risk going over their\n\n150\n00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:16.679\nhead, which means you probably destroyed\nthat relationship, but if you can get\n\n151\n00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:19.843\nhigher, and you can sell to someone\nmuch higher in the organization and\n\n152\n00:08:19.843 --> 00:08:23.585\ngive them a great solution at a reasonable\nprice, it will be uncomfortable, but you\n\n153\n00:08:23.585 --> 00:08:27.000\nwill have gotten the deal, and hopefully\nthe other person will get over it.\n\n154\n00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.401\nBut the goal is to get them on your team,\non your side, and bring you up higher,\n\n155\n00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:35.869\nand obviously, the best strategy is to\nstart high and get as high as you can, and\n\n156\n00:08:35.869 --> 00:08:37.870\nif you get pushed down a little bit,\n\n157\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.038\nat least you can go back up\nwithout burning any bridges.\n\n158\n00:08:41.038 --> 00:08:44.324\nSo, if you've got the right\nsolution to their real problem and\n\n159\n00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:48.478\nyou can't close the deal, you need to\nstart expanding who you're talking to,\n\n160\n00:08:48.478 --> 00:08:50.723\nmove up higher, talk to the right person.\n\n161\n00:08:50.723 --> 00:08:55.351\nNow I'd like to talk a little bit about\nsales results and sales activity.\n\n162\n00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:56.850\nI'm a big, big fan for,\n\n163\n00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.499\nI don't care how hard you work\nas long as you get the results.\n\n164\n00:09:00.499 --> 00:09:03.409\nIf your quota's a million dollars and\nyou can get it in\n\n165\n00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:08.131\none call then you've met your goal, you've\nmet your quota, I'd like you to go out and\n\n166\n00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:12.551\nmake some more calls, but you've delivered\nthe results I asked you to deliver.\n\n167\n00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:17.734\nThe reverse is, if you make 100 calls\na day and you don't close anything,\n\n168\n00:09:17.734 --> 00:09:22.707\nI don't care, I'm worried about\nthe results, not about the activity.\n\n169\n00:09:22.707 --> 00:09:26.153\nNow I will tell you a certain amount of\nactivity usually leads to a certain amount\n\n170\n00:09:26.153 --> 00:09:29.099\nof results, and that's something\nyou should track for yourself.\n\n171\n00:09:29.099 --> 00:09:33.052\nHow many appointments, how many meetings,\nhow many calls does it take for me,\n\n172\n00:09:33.052 --> 00:09:34.528\ntypically, to close a deal?\n\n173\n00:09:34.528 --> 00:09:37.388\nAnd then it does become\na bit of a numbers game.\n\n174\n00:09:37.388 --> 00:09:40.776\nBut input does not\nnecessarily equal output, and\n\n175\n00:09:40.776 --> 00:09:43.930\nthe only thing you're\nmeasured on is output.\n\n176\n00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.056\nSo the key is to figure out what\nkinda clients do I call on,\n\n177\n00:09:47.056 --> 00:09:50.396\nwhat are my A clients,\nwhere do I have the best chance to win?\n\n178\n00:09:50.396 --> 00:09:54.196\nWhere can I put in the least amount of\neffort for the most amount of return, and\n\n179\n00:09:54.196 --> 00:09:57.938\nmake sure that all of the effort I've put\nin does deliver all of the output and\n\n180\n00:09:57.938 --> 00:09:59.928\nresults that I'm required to deliver,\n\n181\n00:09:59.928 --> 00:10:03.292\nand hopefully a whole lot more so\nyou can increase your commission?\n\n182\n00:10:03.292 --> 00:10:07.954\nA good way to think of all that\nis that sales are proportional to\n\n183\n00:10:07.954 --> 00:10:12.797\nthe number of well prepared\nprofessional sales calls you make on\n\n184\n00:10:12.797 --> 00:10:16.847\nkey decision makers, and\nthat should be your focus.\n\n185\n00:10:16.847 --> 00:10:20.780\nHow can I get in front of the right\npeople who can make the decision and\n\n186\n00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.404\nshow up there exceedingly well-prepared,\n\n187\n00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:28.235\nhaving done all my homework, understanding\nas much as I can, with a great agenda,\n\n188\n00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:33.065\nwith fantastic questions, listen to them\nintently, write fantastic notes, and\n\n189\n00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:37.370\nthen figure out what the next steps\nare to move the sale and close the deal?\n\n190\n00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.485\nAnd here's another big idea,\nyou should never,\n\n191\n00:10:40.485 --> 00:10:44.789\never leave a sales call without\nidentifying what the next steps are,\n\n192\n00:10:44.789 --> 00:10:49.261\nwho will do them, what the date is,\nyou've got to have a call purpose.\n\n193\n00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:52.287\nAnd if you don't get out of there\nachieving your call purpose,\n\n194\n00:10:52.287 --> 00:10:55.501\nthen you haven't done what you need\nto do to move the sale forward.\n\n195\n00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:58.931\nI see a lot of sales people ask a bunch of\nquestions, and then they go, hey, great,\n\n196\n00:10:58.931 --> 00:11:02.471\nthanks, well, I'll take this back and\nI'll be in touch, no, that isn't the way.\n\n197\n00:11:02.471 --> 00:11:07.531\nAnd I think it's a great idea to establish\nthe purpose at the beginning of the call,\n\n198\n00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:11.941\nI'm here today to talk to you about\nyour marketing and advertising, and\n\n199\n00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:15.628\nif it seems like we have the exact\nright solution for you, and\n\n200\n00:11:15.628 --> 00:11:20.469\nwe can deliver exactly what you need,\nat the end of this meeting, I'm gonna ask\n\n201\n00:11:20.469 --> 00:11:24.516\nyou to sign a one month trial with\nour firm and see the way we work, or\n\n202\n00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:29.479\nI'm gonna ask you to come on board as one\nof our clients under a monthly retainer.\n\n203\n00:11:29.479 --> 00:11:33.239\nTwo or three things can happen, the person\ncan go, sure, that sounds great to me,\n\n204\n00:11:33.239 --> 00:11:35.092\nthat's the direction I wanna go in too.\n\n205\n00:11:35.092 --> 00:11:37.609\nTwo, they can go, well,\nI can't promise anything,\n\n206\n00:11:37.609 --> 00:11:40.181\nwe'll just have to see how\nthe meeting goes, or three,\n\n207\n00:11:40.181 --> 00:11:43.339\nthey'll go, no, absolutely not,\nand you go, really, why not?\n\n208\n00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:46.601\nAnd if they explain to you that\nthey're not going to become a client,\n\n209\n00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:48.456\nthey're not going to sign a retainer,\n\n210\n00:11:48.456 --> 00:11:52.167\nthey just have a small budget, they only\nhave one project they want to work on,\n\n211\n00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:55.624\nthen you get the decision to make\nwhether it's time to lose early or not.\n\n212\n00:11:55.624 --> 00:11:57.367\nAnd so, or they might say no,\nand you say, why not?\n\n213\n00:11:57.367 --> 00:12:00.532\nWell, I'm not the guy that makes that\ndecision, I'm just here to vet all of\n\n214\n00:12:00.532 --> 00:12:03.846\nthe different people, and then I'm gonna\nmake a recommendation to the owner of\n\n215\n00:12:03.846 --> 00:12:06.515\nthe company and they're the one\nthat's gonna make a decision,\n\n216\n00:12:06.515 --> 00:12:09.461\nwhich then, you've just said,\nokay, talking to the wrong person.\n\n217\n00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:13.210\nSo, establishing the call purpose,\nif you're courageous enough,\n\n218\n00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.020\nis often a great way to qualify at\nthe very beginning of the meeting, but\n\n219\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.464\nyou'll notice the way I phrased it, if the\nmeeting goes well, what I plan to do is,\n\n220\n00:12:21.464 --> 00:12:26.430\nnot, I want you to become a client today,\nthat's aggressive, that's pushy.\n\n221\n00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.302\nIf the meeting goes well and\nI can answer your questions and\n\n222\n00:12:29.302 --> 00:12:32.172\nit seems like we're a really\ngood match for what you need,\n\n223\n00:12:32.172 --> 00:12:35.980\nwhat I'm gonna ask you at the end of the\nmeeting is if you will sign a contract,\n\n224\n00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.259\nor if you'll join, you'll become a client,\nor if you'll purchase this product, or\n\n225\n00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:41.939\nif you'll try one of our trials.\n\n226\n00:12:41.939 --> 00:12:45.217\nWhatever it is,\nsomething to get them to move forward,\n\n227\n00:12:45.217 --> 00:12:48.775\ntake the next step,\npurchase something, become a client,\n\n228\n00:12:48.775 --> 00:12:53.375\nbuy something, agree for you to come in\nand run an analysis, or run a test, but\n\n229\n00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:57.260\nyou gotta get out of there with\nsomething that moves you forward.\n\n230\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.492\nLast but not least,\nactually very, very important,\n\n231\n00:13:00.492 --> 00:13:03.455\nis the fact that you've got to ask for\nreferrals.\n\n232\n00:13:03.455 --> 00:13:06.987\nAnd I'm not going to go into a lot of\ndepth in this, that's another course, but\n\n233\n00:13:06.987 --> 00:13:08.900\nthere's a couple key things around this.\n\n234\n00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.349\nFirst of all, referrals are based\non one thing, and one thing only,\n\n235\n00:13:13.349 --> 00:13:15.587\nextremely satisfied customers.\n\n236\n00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:19.661\nYou've got to be fantastic,\nyou've got to deliver tremendous value,\n\n237\n00:13:19.661 --> 00:13:24.360\nyou've got to be, in your delivery and\nyour products and services, remarkable.\n\n238\n00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.392\nIn other words, so good at what you do\nthat people want to remark about you,\n\n239\n00:13:28.392 --> 00:13:30.710\nthey wanna talk to other people about you.\n\n240\n00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.893\nAnd I will also say that, and\nI've mentioned this before,\n\n241\n00:13:33.893 --> 00:13:36.130\nthe future of referrals is social media.\n\n242\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:40.454\nIf you, yes, you have to advertise with\nyour company, yeah, you've gotta market,\n\n243\n00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:44.421\nyou've gotta do all that stuff, but\nif you get in front of somebody, a client,\n\n244\n00:13:44.421 --> 00:13:48.625\nwho loves you, and they put it on their\nFacebook, their Twitter, their LinkedIn,\n\n245\n00:13:48.625 --> 00:13:52.535\ntheir Google+, how great you are,\nhow awesome your product and service is,\n\n246\n00:13:52.535 --> 00:13:56.503\nhow much they love your product, that's\ngonna be what we call, social proof,\n\n247\n00:13:56.503 --> 00:14:00.234\nwhere they take their credibility,\ntheir respect, their friendships,\n\n248\n00:14:00.234 --> 00:14:03.137\ntheir relationships, and\nthey put them on the line to tell\n\n249\n00:14:03.137 --> 00:14:05.689\neverybody that they should\ndo business with you.\n\n250\n00:14:05.689 --> 00:14:10.721\nBasically, they're taking the trust that\npeople have in them and putting that\n\n251\n00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:15.545\ntrust over on top of you, that is the most\npowerful way to get more business.\n\n252\n00:14:15.545 --> 00:14:20.101\nAnd I'm in the middle of studying this\ndeeply and reading a bunch of books on it\n\n253\n00:14:20.101 --> 00:14:23.886\nto get better at it myself and\nI don't believe many, or really,\n\n254\n00:14:23.886 --> 00:14:27.834\nfrankly, any of the techniques\naround referrals work very well.\n\n255\n00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:32.679\nI think the number one thing is,\ndeliver world class products and services,\n\n256\n00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:36.704\nmake the shopping, buying, and\nowning experience superior,\n\n257\n00:14:36.704 --> 00:14:38.568\nbe a fantastic salesperson,\n\n258\n00:14:38.568 --> 00:14:43.737\ndeliver more value than they thought they\nwould get and then ask for the referral.\n\n259\n00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:48.668\nWhen they say, wow, you were fantastic at\nthis, thank you so much, then you say,\n\n260\n00:14:48.668 --> 00:14:52.613\none of the best ways you could possible\nthank me is to let anyone that\n\n261\n00:14:52.613 --> 00:14:57.347\nyou think would find value in our products\nand services know about our company.\n\n262\n00:14:57.347 --> 00:15:01.769\n99% of our business is driven by word\nof mouth referrals from happy clients,\n\n263\n00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:05.993\nit seems like you're a very happy client,\nso if you run into anybody that you\n\n264\n00:15:05.993 --> 00:15:08.963\nknow that you think would\nwant to do business with us,\n\n265\n00:15:08.963 --> 00:15:11.948\nit would be really awesome\nif you could introduce us.\n\n266\n00:15:11.948 --> 00:15:15.517\nNow, you could ask for\na phone conversation, you could ask for\n\n267\n00:15:15.517 --> 00:15:19.958\nthem to make a phone connection, you could\nask them to take somebody to lunch or\n\n268\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.997\nwhatever, but here's what I wanna\ntell you, when you pressure people\n\n269\n00:15:23.997 --> 00:15:28.549\nabout referrals, and you make them feel\nlike they owe you one, they push back.\n\n270\n00:15:28.549 --> 00:15:32.414\nBut when you say, we've just solved\nsome great problems for you,\n\n271\n00:15:32.414 --> 00:15:35.659\nproblems a lot of other\norganizations like yours have,\n\n272\n00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:39.041\nand if you know anybody else\nthat has those same problems,\n\n273\n00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:43.897\nwe hate to see companies struggling with\nthose problems, we'd love to help them.\n\n274\n00:15:43.897 --> 00:15:46.737\nAnd that is the way to say\nyou don't have to, but\n\n275\n00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:50.785\nif you've got people that are facing\nthe same struggles as you are,\n\n276\n00:15:50.785 --> 00:15:55.190\nhave the same problems, challenges,\nopportunities, frustrations,\n\n277\n00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:59.735\ndesires, and you'd love to see them get\nthe kind of results we delivered for\n\n278\n00:15:59.735 --> 00:16:04.279\nyou And it would be awesome if you would\nput us together, tell them about us,\n\n279\n00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:09.179\nwhatever it might be, and if you can do\nthat with honesty, professionalism, and\n\n280\n00:16:09.179 --> 00:16:14.049\nno major pressure, then you will find out\nthat you will get a lot more referrals.\n\n281\n00:16:14.049 --> 00:16:18.118\nWhich leads me to ask for your referrals,\nif you feel like you've gotten a lot of\n\n282\n00:16:18.118 --> 00:16:20.974\nvalue from this series,\nwe're all sales people here,\n\n283\n00:16:20.974 --> 00:16:25.288\nif you know anybody else that struggles in\nsales, has a hard time with questioning,\n\n284\n00:16:25.288 --> 00:16:29.844\nobjections, pushback, wants to be the best\nin the world, all the stuff I've covered,\n\n285\n00:16:29.844 --> 00:16:33.672\nif you know any other sales people, or\norganizations that need that kind of\n\n286\n00:16:33.672 --> 00:16:37.742\ninformation, it would be wonderful if you\nwould send them to the web site so they\n\n287\n00:16:37.742 --> 00:16:41.770\ncan take a look at this and see if it's\nright for them, that would be awesome.\n\n288\n00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.507\nBy the way, that's just how you do it,\nI'm using the stuff I'm teaching you.\n\n289\n00:16:45.507 --> 00:16:48.557\nLet me finish off by saying this,\na couple things, first,\n\n290\n00:16:48.557 --> 00:16:50.876\nthere's a whole bunch more resources here.\n\n291\n00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:55.962\nI've downloaded examples of the questions,\narticles, other things to read,\n\n292\n00:16:55.962 --> 00:16:59.847\nlinks to blogs, the list of my\ntop 60 books I've ever read,\n\n293\n00:16:59.847 --> 00:17:04.366\nthere's a wealth of other information\nhere for you to study and learn.\n\n294\n00:17:04.366 --> 00:17:08.043\nWhich leads me to number two, you will\nnot learn all of this just in this video,\n\n295\n00:17:08.043 --> 00:17:10.825\nin these series of videos,\nyou've got to practice this.\n\n296\n00:17:10.825 --> 00:17:14.424\nYou've got to sit down and work on it,\nread the stuff I've given you,\n\n297\n00:17:14.424 --> 00:17:18.816\nwrite out the questions, write out your\nobjection handling techniques, figure out\n\n298\n00:17:18.816 --> 00:17:22.598\nhow to create that agenda or needs\nanalysis or list of stuff to go over, and\n\n299\n00:17:22.598 --> 00:17:26.990\nwork, work, work at this, you will not get\nbetter just by listening to the course and\n\n300\n00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.580\ndoing, you've got to\nreally put some effort in.\n\n301\n00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.116\nI'll use a sports analogy here,\nyou don't get better at golf\n\n302\n00:17:33.116 --> 00:17:38.013\nby watching the PGA Championship on TV and\ngoing, now I'm just gonna go out and play,\n\n303\n00:17:38.013 --> 00:17:41.234\nI can crush Tiger Woods,\nno, you've gotta practice.\n\n304\n00:17:41.234 --> 00:17:44.489\nYou've gotta practice your driving,\nyou've gotta practice your chipping,\n\n305\n00:17:44.489 --> 00:17:47.596\nyou've gotta practice your putting,\nyou've gotta practice it a lot, and\n\n306\n00:17:47.596 --> 00:17:50.942\nit's gonna be incremental that you get\na little bit better, a little bit better,\n\n307\n00:17:50.942 --> 00:17:51.837\na little bit better.\n\n308\n00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:56.347\nSo this isn't watch the video world class,\nit's go through the course,\n\n309\n00:17:56.347 --> 00:18:00.708\nstudy it, work on it, continue to\nwork on your craft, and over weeks,\n\n310\n00:18:00.708
