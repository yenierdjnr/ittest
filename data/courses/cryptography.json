Series,\n\n3\n00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:10.005\nMike Rodrick here and\nwith me is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:10.776\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:13.311\n>> Doing pretty good today, Mike.\n\n6\n00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:14.671\nHow about you?\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:16.796\nLooking forward to this.\n\n8\n00:00:16.796 --> 00:00:24.600\nWe are going to be spending the next week\ncovering Sean's book called Cryptography.\n\n9\n00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.710\nSo Sean, first of all, why this book?\n\n10\n00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.362\nI know we got a lot of different\nbooks out there that I can go and\n\n11\n00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.482\nget about cryptography and other than\nthe fact that you wrote this one,\n\n12\n00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:34.000\n[LAUGH] what makes this one so good?\n\n13\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.235\n>> There you go.\n\n14\n00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.095\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or is there any other reason?\n\n15\n00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:38.975\n[LAUGH]\n>> Do you need another one?\n\n16\n00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:40.765\n>> That's what I was thinking.\n\n17\n00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:42.671\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n18\n00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:44.890\nI've always had an interest\nin cryptography.\n\n19\n00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.180\nIt's been something that's just\nfascinated me since I was very young.\n\n20\n00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.060\nWhen I set about writing this book,\n\n21\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.780\nit comes on the heels of being\ninterested in this for years, but\n\n22\n00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.490\nonly seeing books that did beginning\nstuff right in the first chapter or two,\n\n23\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.220\nand then all of a sudden they're jumping\ninto all these abstract concepts.\n\n24\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.160\nNow, someone jumping in new to\nthat is gonna have a problem.\n\n25\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.252\nI mean, if you're an experienced person,\nif you're, we joke around,\n\n26\n00:01:11.252 --> 00:01:14.120\na propeller head,\nyou understand mathematics and all that,\n\n27\n00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.300\nthen maybe you're gonna get, jumping\ninto the advanced stuff really quick.\n\n28\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.940\nBut I wanted something that was easily\nunderstandable, dispensed with as many\n\n29\n00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.190\nof the formulas as possible, which I\navoided putting any of them in there.\n\n30\n00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.960\nI think there's like one or\ntwo in there, that's about it.\n\n31\n00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.130\nAnd so, I tried to make it accessible and\ngive examples and\n\n32\n00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.770\nmake it easy to understand.\n\n33\n00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.520\nSo in the end,\nthe result was a book that I'm proud of,\n\n34\n00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.890\nthat does make it easy,\ndoes show examples, and\n\n35\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.410\nmakes it accessible to anybody that\nis working with mathematics or not.\n\n36\n00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.270\nSomebody that is in IT,\nwhich this would be very useful for.\n\n37\n00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.500\nA security person, anybody,\nliterally anybody, can read this book.\n\n38\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.350\n>> So really not geared towards\nany one person or one field.\n\n39\n00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.820\nThis is something that somebody that has\na little experience can pick up and enjoy.\n\n40\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.720\nAs well as somebody that had never\nlooked at cryptography before,\n\n41\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.710\ncould pick up this book and\nreally enjoy it and\n\n42\n00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.500\nget a good understanding of that basic\nfoundation of knowledge on cryptography.\n\n43\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.210\n>> Exactly.\n\n44\n00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.210\n>> Fantastic.\n\n45\n00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.080\n>> And from what I've heard from people\nat Reddit, that's been the result, so\n\n46\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.110\nI'm pretty happy about it.\n\n47\n00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.220\nAnd I think it's just something that\ncan make a complex topic accessible.\n\n48\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.720\nIt's actually in the form of,\nin some ways, almost like a puzzle book,\n\n49\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.110\nso it can be fun.\n\n50\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.980\n>> All right, so looking forward to it,\nlooking forward to it.\n\n51\n00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.990\nSo what kinda things are we gonna talk\nabout over the next week here in our show?\n\n52\n00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.920\n>> Over the next week we\nare gonna talk about all different\n\n53\n00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.120\naspects in cryptography.\n\n54\n00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.470\nWe'll talk some about the history\nof cryptography, we'll talk about\n\n55\n00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.360\nterminology, we will talk about classic\ncryptography in the term of symmetric.\n\n56\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.360\nWe'll move to modern,\nasymmetric cryptography examples, hashing,\n\n57\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.030\nsteganography.\n\n58\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.690\nWe'll talk about applications of it, and\n\n59\n00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.980\nthen we'll end stuff off with what\nthe future of cryptography looks like.\n\n60\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.740\nWhen we get into some stuff that may\nbe kind of abstract in the form of\n\n61\n00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.712\nquantum cryptography, and\nthat means quantum physics, so.\n\n62\n00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:14.702\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So I'm giving you a chance to study and\n\n63\n00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:16.650\nre-up on stuff, but\nit's some exciting stuff.\n\n64\n00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.830\n>> The whole spectrum of things\nwe're gonna see in here.\n\n65\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.680\n>> Fantastic.\n\n66\n00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.227\nFantastic.\nWell, I hope everybody out there is as\n\n67\n00:03:23.227 --> 00:03:26.570\nexcited as I am to get started\nin the world of cryptography, so\n\n68\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.230\nmake sure you tune in and\ncheck out our episodes.\n\n69\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.849\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:36.171\nwelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.300\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.390\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.680\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n7\n00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.030\n>> I'm doing fantastic,\n\n8\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.910\nwe are getting ready to kick\noff our cryptography episode.\n\n9\n00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.250\nSo this is episode number one,\nand if you missed it,\n\n10\n00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.195\nwe are covering Sean Oriyano book called,\nappropriately enough, Photography.\n\n11\n00:00:55.195 --> 00:00:56.170\n[LAUGH]\n>> Available\n\n12\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.400\nat fine bookstores everywhere.\n\n13\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.400\n>> That's right.\nThat's right.\n\n14\n00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.920\nMake sure you go out and pick up a copy\nof that, and we're gonna, as I said,\n\n15\n00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.570\nwe're gonna be covering that all week.\n\n16\n00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.380\nSo stay tuned to make sure you're\ntuning in for these episodes.\n\n17\n00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.490\nSo in this episode we're gonna talk\nabout the history of photography,\n\n18\n00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.030\ncause as with anything, if I know, I'm\ntrying to think of a good way to say it.\n\n19\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.560\nWe know where it came from.\n\n20\n00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.070\nThat makes it a lot easier to\nunderstand it and see where it's going.\n\n21\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.720\nRight?\nSo even though, maybe, I don't know,\n\n22\n00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.600\nI do think it's exciting personally.\n\n23\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.830\nSometimes people think, oh history yuck,\nbut this is great stuff, right Sean?\n\n24\n00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.390\n>> Yes, I think the history of\ncryptography is actually quite exciting.\n\n25\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.110\nBut remember, we're not just doing\nit here just to kind of talk\n\n26\n00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.300\nabout a lot of stuff that happened back\nin ancient times, or anything like that.\n\n27\n00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.800\nThere actually is a purpose behind this,\nas with anything we're gonna be doing this\n\n28\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.080\nweek, is a lot of ancient examples,\nwhile they are very simplistic\n\n29\n00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.220\nfrom the perspective of what we're looking\nat today, they do illustrate stuff\n\n30\n00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.040\nthat we're gonna talk about later on in\na simple enough to understand manner.\n\n31\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.180\nThat we can translate those skills\nover to the more advanced things.\n\n32\n00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.542\nSo instead of just jumping in and talking\nabout something like AES or triple or\n\n33\n00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:15.964\nsomething like that, we can immediately\njust say, okay, here's the history of it,\n\n34\n00:02:15.964 --> 00:02:20.820\nhere's some of the ways they've dealt with\ncryptography in the past and kept secrets.\n\n35\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.640\nAnd we can later on, we're talking about\nsome of those more advanced things.\n\n36\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.470\nWe can say, hey, remember this cipher,\nremember this technique and\n\n37\n00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.510\nyou'll be oh yeah, I do remember that and,\noh, if I scale this up, that makes sense.\n\n38\n00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.560\nThat makes this algorithm\nmore understandable or\n\n39\n00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.970\nthis process more easy to grasp.\n\n40\n00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.780\nSo there is a purpose behind it and\nthat will help\n\n41\n00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.850\nyou get through things without having\nto scratch your head and go, \"Well,\n\n42\n00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.590\nis he still actually speaking English or\ndid I hit the closed captions or\n\n43\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.280\nsomething along the way?\" It should\nmake it easier to understand so\n\n44\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.990\nthat's the whole purpose of the history,\nbut yeah your right it is exciting.\n\n45\n00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.350\n>> I think it's\n>> Fascinating to see where it's come.\n\n46\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.450\nCuz, you know,\nme personally I think of cryptography,\n\n47\n00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.140\nI think, it's something new it's\nsomething that came out with computers.\n\n48\n00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.660\nWe started encryption and things like that\nbut I couldn't be further from the truth.\n\n49\n00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.890\nIt's been around since we've\nhad secrets to keep really.\n\n50\n00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.210\n>> Yes.\nThat's the thing,\n\n51\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.170\nsince\n>> There's been a reason to keep\n\n52\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.370\ninformation away from someone else,\nthan there's need for cryptography.\n\n53\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.080\nA need for this secret writing.\n\n54\n00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.430\nOr secret ways of\ntransmitting information,\n\n55\n00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.690\nif you want to say it that way.\n\n56\n00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.690\nI mean, or\nconveying information and ideas.\n\n57\n00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.490\n>> And that goes back from the time\nhuman beings learned how to talk and\n\n58\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.930\nhow to do cave paintings.\n\n59\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.675\nWhich some argue that cave\npaintings are some of the first\n\n60\n00:03:46.675 --> 00:03:48.065\nExamples of cryptography.\n\n61\n00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:52.555\nI know it's a little bit of a stretch,\nI think, but,you kind of,\n\n62\n00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:56.755\nyou kind of grasp what they're going for,\nbecause you know if you were writing\n\n63\n00:03:56.755 --> 00:04:02.165\nsomething about where to find a good\nhunting ground, or a good place to gather,\n\n64\n00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:06.005\nyou know, fruits and\nvegetables and stuff like that,\n\n65\n00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:10.800\nor where you were gonna, where migration\nsites were for the winter or anything.\n\n66\n00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.730\nYou may not want other people to know that\nso you might use special symbols, but\n\n67\n00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.750\nit's kind of hard to\nget that stretch on it,\n\n68\n00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.770\nbut it does in a way fit into\nthe world of cryptography.\n\n69\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.490\n>> If anything it could be\npre-cryptography, right?\n\n70\n00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.100\nOr something like that.\n\n71\n00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.800\n>> You could definitely make that case..\n\n72\n00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.760\nAnd in fact, interesting enough, some of\nthe techniques that we use to break lost\n\n73\n00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.960\nlanguages are almost the same techniques,\nif not the same techniques, we use for\n\n74\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.360\ncode breaking and doing cryptanalysis,\na topic that we'll talk about later on.\n\n75\n00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.080\nThere's plenty of examples with that.\n\n76\n00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.390\n>> In fact,\nthere's one language from an Empire\n\n77\n00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.800\nthat fell thousands of years\nago in the Middle East.\n\n78\n00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.990\nAnd it's considered to be the last\nmajor language that is unknown.\n\n79\n00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.570\nAnd the way they are breaking it is\nby using cryptanalysis techniques.\n\n80\n00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.710\nIt's just really fascinating when you\nlook at these symbols laid out there.\n\n81\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.790\nAnd how they're drawn and how when\nyou're trying to get in the mind of\n\n82\n00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.720\nthe person that actually carved\nthese symbols to look at it and\n\n83\n00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.580\nsay, yeah I can see they were\nwriting this from left to right.\n\n84\n00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.900\nSo that's the way I've\ngotta interpret this.\n\n85\n00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.920\nAnd this symbol appears this often.\n\n86\n00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.740\nAnd this one's always associated\nwith this other symbol.\n\n87\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.870\nIt's just mind-blowing when you\nstart reasoning stuff Stuff out.\n\n88\n00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.390\nSo.\n>> Yeah.\n\n89\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.260\n>> We will talk about some of that,\n\n90\n00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.620\nbut cryptography goes back a long,\nlong, long way.\n\n91\n00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.570\n>> So cryptography,\na term we've already used several times,\n\n92\n00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.070\nlet's go, let's take a step back then and\ndefine, Sean, what you mean by, or\n\n93\n00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.710\nwhat we mean by cryptography.\n\n94\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.980\nCryptography is really discussing a way\nof doing secret or hidden writing.\n\n95\n00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.140\nThat's kind of what,\n\n96\n00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.310\nwhen we look at that base word crypto,\nthat's what it refers to.\n\n97\n00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.460\nYou see crypto [INAUDIBLE] that\nprefix used in a lot of other areas.\n\n98\n00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.180\nOne I think of is cryptobiology,\nor cryptozoology.\n\n99\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.810\nCryptozoology, if you\nhaven't heard about that, and\n\n100\n00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.089\nyou don't watch the History Channel or\nthe Discovery Channel.\n\n101\n00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:27.300\n[LAUGH] It's the study of these animals or\n\n102\n00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.850\nwhatever, or beings,\nwhatever you wanna call them that are not\n\n103\n00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.440\nin the current animal kingdom,\nor not documented yet.\n\n104\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.270\nAnd we're talking stuff like\npeople looking at Bigfoot or\n\n105\n00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.600\nLoch Ness monster, [LAUGH] anything,\nOgopogo, anything like that,\n\n106\n00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.370\nthey're looking at those types of things.\n\n107\n00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.150\nThere's a whole field called cryptozoology\nwhere people are like, oh yeah,\n\n108\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.450\nif you look at this, here's the yeti,\nand here's some footprints, yeah.\n\n109\n00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.340\nIt's the same type of thing.\n\n110\n00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.410\nThey're like hidden animals or\nhidden things.\n\n111\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.190\nSo, cryptography, hidden, and\n\n112\n00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.790\nthe graph part of it, is basically\nthe writing part of it, so hidden writing.\n\n113\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:05.370\n>> Exactly.\n\n114\n00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.500\nHidden or secret writing.\n\n115\n00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.960\nOkay.\nAnd why would I have a need for\n\n116\n00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.290\ncryptography?\n\n117\n00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.850\nWhat's it's purpose?\n\n118\n00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:18.140\n>> The primary need for cryptography\nis to keep information concealed.\n\n119\n00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.830\nThat was the main thing it was designed\nfor, or intended to do originally.\n\n120\n00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.475\nIt's since started to include other\nthings underneath that banner.\n\n121\n00:07:27.475 --> 00:07:31.585\nSo you have cryptography\nwith the ability to\n\n122\n00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:34.375\npreserve the confidentiality\nof information.\n\n123\n00:07:34.375 --> 00:07:38.665\nAs well as hashing, which is another one\nwhich we're gonna talk about later on.\n\n124\n00:07:38.665 --> 00:07:40.765\nIt's also part of cryptography and\n\n125\n00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:44.015\nthat is a way of verifying\nthe integrity of information.\n\n126\n00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:48.700\nSo if you're an information security\nperson and you know the CIA principal.\n\n127\n00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.039\nThis covers the C and\nthe I portion of that.\n\n128\n00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:55.927\nAnd there actually is a bigger\narea called cryptology and\n\n129\n00:07:55.927 --> 00:08:01.034\nall that good stuff that covers all\nsorts of things on top of cryptography.\n\n130\n00:08:01.034 --> 00:08:04.251\nThat covers the mathematics and\nthe code breaking, cryptanalysis.\n\n131\n00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:09.228\nAnd all that, but if we're talking\njust cryptography, we're using it to\n\n132\n00:08:09.228 --> 00:08:14.070\nprotect our information either from\nbeing seen or from being altered.\n\n133\n00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.610\nThat's what we would use it for.\n\n134\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:21.600\n>> So that then would be our goal, to keep\nsomething hidden from unauthorized people.\n\n135\n00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.660\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n136\n00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.950\n>> And to be able to verify\nthe integrity of something, maybe.\n\n137\n00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.210\n>> Yes, it depends on what period\nof time you're talking about.\n\n138\n00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.990\nHashing is relatively new thing.\n\n139\n00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.070\nTypically when you talk about\ncryptography, and talk about it in a broad\n\n140\n00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.725\nhistory, you're pretty much talking\nabout concealing information.\n\n141\n00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:41.305\nAnd keeping it away from\nunauthorized parties.\n\n142\n00:08:41.305 --> 00:08:43.575\n>> And if you guys aren't\nfamiliar with the CIA triad,\n\n143\n00:08:43.575 --> 00:08:47.485\ncheck out our security plus episodes or\nour CEH episodes.\n\n144\n00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:51.205\nCIA not talking about the government\nagency here in the US.\n\n145\n00:08:51.205 --> 00:08:54.835\nBut confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability.\n\n146\n00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:57.455\nAnd cryptography can help\nus with those first two.\n\n147\n00:08:57.455 --> 00:09:00.670\nWith the confidentiality and\nthe integrity.\n\n148\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:01.303\nAll right.\n\n149\n00:09:01.303 --> 00:09:05.040\nSo Sean, let's start then with\nthe history of cryptography.\n\n150\n00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.400\nAs we know, it's important to understand\nwhere it came from, how it developed.\n\n151\n00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.293\nIt makes it a whole lot easier to\nunderstand, if we see it from the very\n\n152\n00:09:12.293 --> 00:09:16.810\nbeginning and not just try to dive into\nit right in the middle, so way back when.\n\n153\n00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.510\nHow far are we going back there, Sean?\n\n154\n00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.890\n>> We could go pretty far\nback if we wanted to.\n\n155\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.300\nSo I'm not gonna go all\nthe way back to someone.\n\n156\n00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:26.840\n>> No cavemen.\n\n157\n00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.080\n>> Yeah, no cavemen.\n\n158\n00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.580\nYou know, they like smacking stuff\non the rocks, and stuff like that.\n\n159\n00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.710\nNo, we're not gonna go back that far,\ncuz that's even questionable if that was\n\n160\n00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.830\ncryptography since a lot of the symbols\nwe just still don't fully understand in\n\n161\n00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.250\nthe first place, to even know if this\nis what they were trying to even do.\n\n162\n00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.840\nWe won't go back that far, but\nwe will set our time machines, or for some\n\n163\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.740\nof our people, out here at the TARDIS,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.300\n>> just to kind of make you feel more\n\n165\n00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.360\ncomfortable and at home.\n\n166\n00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.620\nWe can talk about one of\nthe oldest ones in here,\n\n167\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:04.080\nor the oldest one we'll talk about,\nis the ones used by the ancient Egyptians.\n\n168\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.970\nAnd the one we're talking about is\nactually may not be something that you\n\n169\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:13.130\nthink about with cryptography,\nis hieroglyphics.\n\n170\n00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.670\nHieroglyphics actually would count\nby a lot of definitions as a form of\n\n171\n00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:17.970\ncryptography.\n\n172\n00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.130\nI see, David mentioned Atbash.\n\n173\n00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.240\nThat would be one that'd be right\naround the same time frame.\n\n174\n00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.090\nI don't really discuss that in here, but\nthat's a good catch, that is an older one.\n\n175\n00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.540\nBut what we're talking about is when\n\n176\n00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.630\nwe look at the ancient\nEgyptian hieroglyphics.\n\n177\n00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.570\nThey've fit a lot of the things\nthat we're looking at or\n\n178\n00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.370\ndiscussing with cryptography.\n\n179\n00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.630\nIt's a language that was used\nby a small number of people.\n\n180\n00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.920\nNow you may think well, Egyptians?\n\n181\n00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.290\nEgyptians, that was a pretty big empire.\n\n182\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.075\nThat's not exactly\na small number of people.\n\n183\n00:10:55.075 --> 00:10:58.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well If you look at your history and\n\n184\n00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.450\nanalyze the way hieroglyphics\nwere actually used,\n\n185\n00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.500\nactually wasn't used by everybody.\n\n186\n00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.350\nThat's not something,\nan everyday language,\n\n187\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.710\nit was never intended to be something\nthat was used as an everyday language.\n\n188\n00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:13.280\nIt was used by royal family, priests,\npeople that decorated tombs.\n\n189\n00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.260\nIt was very specific who used that.\n\n190\n00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.594\nThe everyday language\nwas one called demotic,\n\n191\n00:11:18.594 --> 00:11:20.850\nI hope I'm getting the name right.\n\n192\n00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.280\nWas one called demotic,\n\n193\n00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.240\nthat was just something that you use\nin your day to day conversation.\n\n194\n00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.490\nSo we had a much broader usage,\ntherefore that's one that you\n\n195\n00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:36.700\nreally aren't gonna contain any secrets\nwith, because almost everybody did use it.\n\n196\n00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.570\nWe won't even say almost everybody.\n\n197\n00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:44.590\nWe'll say everybody in the Egyptian world\nused this as their everyday language,\n\n198\n00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.820\nso it just something that stuck around.\n\n199\n00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.100\nWas used by other people outside\nthe empire that were trading,\n\n200\n00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.640\nso it had a pretty big usage,\nbut hieroglyphics didn't.\n\n201\n00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.690\nAnd because of that you've got all these\nsymbols and everything that are being\n\n202\n00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:04.000\nused, in this special language,\nrestricted to a certain number of people.\n\n203\n00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.540\nAnd cryptography's the same kind of way.\n\n204\n00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.760\nA lot of our cryptographic techniques,\nyou may use them, but\n\n205\n00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.410\ndon't understand how they work or how they\ntick, or you may not use them at all.\n\n206\n00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.590\nAnd so it fits that what we're\nlooking at for cryptography.\n\n207\n00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:23.240\nNow something to remember, which is\nreally, really cool with cryptography and\n\n208\n00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.960\nhieroglyphics, and if you don't remember\nwhat hieroglyphics look like or\n\n209\n00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.590\nanything, I've got a sample\nup on my screen here.\n\n210\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:38.090\nThis is some stuff etched in a stone\nfrom a tomb in Egypt someplace.\n\n211\n00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.640\nI couldn't tell you which one.\n\n212\n00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.580\nIt's something that we've seen before,\nit's something that's not unusual.\n\n213\n00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.860\nBut it looks fascinating.\n\n214\n00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.910\nWhen people first looked at this,\nthey thought it was just artwork.\n\n215\n00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.260\nAnd then they thought it was other things.\n\n216\n00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.010\nA whole bunch of theories\nwent around with it.\n\n217\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.550\nAnd no one really knew what\nit was when the modern\n\n218\n00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.510\npeople see it after the Egyptian\nempire fell, they looked at this and\n\n219\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.620\nthey're like I don't know what\nthe heck's going on here,\n\n220\n00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.970\nyou know they just really couldn't figure\nit out, and no one understood it at all.\n\n221\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.920\nSo that made it really kind of tough and\ntricky and all that.\n\n222\n00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.940\nWell, low and behold,\nit did get understood.\n\n223\n00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.810\nWe understand how to\nread these things now.\n\n224\n00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:19.450\nAnd the reason why,\n\n225\n00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.600\nis because something that we\nare gonna see again in this course.\n\n226\n00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.048\nSomething called the Rosetta Stone,\nwhich is a piece of software.\n\n227\n00:13:27.048 --> 00:13:32.976\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is the thing, just in case.\n\n228\n00:13:32.976 --> 00:13:36.000\nI don't know how many people know\nabout Rosetta Stone in here.\n\n229\n00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.090\nAnd I do have a picture of it.\n\n230\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.820\nThis is the Rosetta Stone over here.\n\n231\n00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.700\nThe original Rosetta Stone is\nactually in the British Museum.\n\n232\n00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.060\nAnd you can actually go see it there.\n\n233\n00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.660\nYou can find pictures of it online,\nand If you're in the UK or\n\n234\n00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.920\nanything, go visit the thing.\n\n235\n00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.000\nIt's really fascinating to see.\n\n236\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.110\nThis is what it looks like.\n\n237\n00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:02.495\nAnd it played a very, very important role\nin deciphering the Egyptian language,\n\n238\n00:14:02.495 --> 00:14:05.380\ncuz if you look at this you can actually\nsee it, there's three breaks in there.\n\n239\n00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.390\nThere's three sets of languages in there.\n\n240\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:12.210\nIf I zoom this up, which I will do\nthat for you, what we have up top is,\n\n241\n00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:16.910\nthis is your hieroglyphics,\nthis middle section, that is demotic.\n\n242\n00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.780\nThat's the regular everyday\nEgyptian language.\n\n243\n00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.530\nAnd then this bottom part, that's Latin.\n\n244\n00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.990\nSo the reason why that we're\nable to decrypt this, or\n\n245\n00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.600\nuse cryptographic techniques and\n\n246\n00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.870\nunderstand what hieroglyphics were,\nis that they still knew what demotic was.\n\n247\n00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.880\nSo when people used it.\n\n248\n00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:36.990\nYou could find somebody.\n\n249\n00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.920\nYou could pick somebody off\nthe street basically and say hey,\n\n250\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.230\ndo you know demotic?\n\n251\n00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.475\nYeah, okay, well, read that.\n\n252\n00:14:42.475 --> 00:14:45.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Basically that's what it was.\n\n253\n00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.725\nLatin, do I really need to say\nthat Latin is still used today?\n\n254\n00:14:48.725 --> 00:14:50.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's used all over the place.\n\n255\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.090\nSo it's a very popular language,\nvery widely used.\n\n256\n00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:59.540\nHieroglyphics on the other hand,\nsince it had a small usage group, and\n\n257\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:05.500\nwhen they found this stone, was the exact\ndates gone, out of my head right now.\n\n258\n00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.750\nSomeone looks up the date go\nahead throw it in the chat room.\n\n259\n00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.310\n>> Was it 1700 I can't remember.\n\n260\n00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.360\nI'll look at that while\nyou guys keep going here.\n\n261\n00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.770\n>> Yeah, it was during Napoleon,\nthe first reign I believe.\n\n262\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.940\nBut when they found this stone.\n\n263\n00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.040\nIt was the key to unlocking it.\n\n264\n00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.240\nBecause no one understood it.\n\n265\n00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.580\nLast person that knew how\nto read hieroglyphics,\n\n266\n00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.720\nwas a priest that probably died like five,\n600 years ago.\n\n267\n00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.250\nSo lost language.\n\n268\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:36.040\nThey found this, they looked at it, and\nsaid okay, we know demotic, we know Latin,\n\n269\n00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.730\nwe read it,\nboth those messages correspond, so\n\n270\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.810\nit makes sense that the piece up\ntop would be the same message,\n\n271\n00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.380\njust in the language of hieroglyphics.\n\n272\n00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.450\nSo they used cryptographic techniques or\ncryptanalysis techniques,\n\n273\n00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.700\nrather, to decipher that language.\n\n274\n00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.850\nAnd it's, the story of it is actually\nreally, really, really fascinating.\n\n275\n00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:55.679\nSo oh, 1801, okay, cool.\n\n276\n00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:57.166\n>> 1801, yep.\n\n277\n00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:59.340\n>> So there you go.\n\n278\n00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.058\nOkay, Greek.\n\n279\n00:16:00.058 --> 00:16:01.178\nAll right.\n\n280\n00:16:01.178 --> 00:16:01.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n281\n00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.264\nyou know I really don't like\nit when you guys fact check.\n\n282\n00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:06.424\nYou guys wanna teach this class?\n\n283\n00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:07.167\nGet over here.\n\n284\n00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:07.850\nNo.\n\n285\n00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:12.645\n>> So the key to this, the Rosetta Stone,\nit wasn't that he was meaning for this to\n\n286\n00:16:12.645 --> 00:16:17.226\nbe some kind of, whoever the author was\nthat wrote this document or chiseled\n\n287\n00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:22.381\nthe document, it wasn't like he was trying\nto write a key to breaking cryptography,\n\n288\n00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:27.140\nhe just happened to write the same\nmessage in three different languages.\n\n289\n00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.100\nSome of those languages\nstill readable today.\n\n290\n00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.520\nSo by having the same message\nin two different languages,\n\n291\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.430\nI can try to figure out.\n\n292\n00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:37.370\nI can use that information then\nto decode those hieroglyphics.\n\n293\n00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.740\n>> Yeah, exactly,\nthat's the type of stuff that they used.\n\n294\n00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:46.610\nIt's just fascinating, which is why\nthe Rosetta Stone, when it was used\n\n295\n00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.990\nto reveal or unleash or\n\n296\n00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.330\nwhatever you wanna call it, reintroduce\nI guess is the term I'm looking for,\n\n297\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.170\nthe hieroglyphics out\ninto the world again.\n\n298\n00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.120\nIt played a huge role in that.\n\n299\n00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.980\nThat's why to this day when\nyou hear someone say it,\n\n300\n00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.540\nthis is the Rosetta Stone of this, or-\n>> Yeah.\n\n301\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.460\n>> That's why they use that term.\n\n302\n00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:14.260\nThis is the Rosetta Stone,\nof let's say the Rosetta Stone of biology,\n\n303\n00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.850\nthe Rosetta Stone of Physics or\nwhat have you,\n\n304\n00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:21.820\nthat's because of the role that's played,\nit unlocked an area of knowledge.\n\n305\n00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:25.760\nAnd it was substantial, and so you hear\nthat, that's why they call the software\n\n306\n00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.470\nRosetta Stone because it's revealing\na new language to you, the user.\n\n307\n00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.560\n>> Yeah.\nAnd they had tried, as you said before\n\n308\n00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.060\nthey found this Rosetta Stone,\nthis key, they had tried and tried and\n\n309\n00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:43.040\ntried to decipher these hieroglyphics,\nand partially successful, but not really.\n\n310\n00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.200\nUntil this came along, and\nthen it made everything readable.\n\n311\n00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.960\n>> Yeah, and Chris, were there\nany more pieces or just this one?\n\n312\n00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.390\nThe Rosetta Stone right here,\nthis was the piece,\n\n313\n00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:55.170\nthey actually interestingly\nenough found this as part of, or\n\n314\n00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.910\nthey found this when they were\nbuilding fortifications I believe.\n\n315\n00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.940\nThe French soldiers that were there,\nthey found this piece.\n\n316\n00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.860\nSomeone actually turned it over and\nsaid whoa, this may be important.\n\n317\n00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.520\nSo it got put aside.\n\n318\n00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.450\nSo this is all they found.\n\n319\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:11.590\nThey never found the rest of it.\n\n320\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.740\nIt either crumbled with time or\ngot broken off.\n\n321\n00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.160\nAs far as I know ,they never\nfound any more of this piece, but\n\n322\n00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.450\nthey found stuff similar since then.\n\n323\n00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.020\nThey suspect this one\nwas outside a temple or\n\n324\n00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:29.360\nsomething of that nature because of\nthe nature of the message in it.\n\n325\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.220\nSo it just has a fascinating history,\nif you look at the Rosetta Stone,\n\n326\n00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.830\njust the way they found it and\nthe way it changed hands.\n\n327\n00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.150\nCuz you wonder, well,\nthe French and British,\n\n328\n00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.370\nthey've had a beef with one another for\na long time.\n\n329\n00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.515\nSome would say they still do.\n\n330\n00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:45.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n331\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:50.270\nwhen they found this one, they were\nvery much had a beef with one another.\n\n332\n00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.102\nYou're at 1801, come on.\n\n333\n00:18:51.102 --> 00:18:51.880\n>> [LAUGH] Mm-hm.\n\n334\n00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.130\n>> They definitely had\na beef with one another.\n\n335\n00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:59.870\nSo when this was found by the French, it's\nlike how did end up at the British hands?\n\n336\n00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:04.540\nI won't get into the whole story of that,\nbut I will just tell you\n\n337\n00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.980\nif it's something that you want to do,\nsome little extra credit read or\n\n338\n00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:12.110\nsomething on it, yeah, take a look at it,\nit's just an amazing, amazing history.\n\n339\n00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.696\nI also want to add, by the way,\n\n340\n00:19:13.696 --> 00:19:17.295\nwhen you look at this whole thing,\nwhen you look at the Rosetta Stone,\n\n341\n00:19:17.295 --> 00:19:20.955\ncontrary to popular belief and\na lot of people that use Apple products,\n\n342\n00:19:20.955 --> 00:19:25.052\nthis is the first example of someone\ninstalling a new language on their tablet.\n\n343\n00:19:25.052 --> 00:19:29.743\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I win, all right, done.\n\n344\n00:19:29.743 --> 00:19:33.829\nI didn't say it was good humor,\nI just said tablet, language off of it.\n\n345\n00:19:33.829 --> 00:19:36.092\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n346\n00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:40.230\nAll right, so we've got our ancient\nEgyptians, we kind of, in a way,\n\n347\n00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.230\nthey were using cryptography\nall the way back then to keep\n\n348\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.320\ncertain secrets from most of the public.\n\n349\n00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.540\nThey didn't want the average\nJoe being able to understand\n\n350\n00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.500\nhow to rise up to the deities, or\nwhatever the case may have been, right-\n\n351\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.620\n>> Yeah, it was meant for\n\n352\n00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.920\nthe dead and for the gods and\nstuff like that.\n\n353\n00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.640\nIt was meant for them to be interpreted.\n\n354\n00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.750\nPeople understood it, but\nit wasn't meant for everyday consumption.\n\n355\n00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:12.910\nIt was a sacred language meant for\na very specific\n\n356\n00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:17.069\naudience, in this case,\ntheir pantheon of gods.\n\n357\n00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:18.635\n>> All right, and\n\n358\n00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:21.730\nthey weren't the only ones that were\nusing cryptography way back then, right?\n\n359\n00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.600\n>> Yeah, or\nsome that were considered forms of it.\n\n360\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:30.530\nOr some things that had to be recovered\nusing cryptographic similar techniques.\n\n361\n00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:34.720\nThat's why talking about this is\nthat you look at the Egyptian stuff.\n\n362\n00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.850\nYou could easily argue that no,\nthat's not cryptography.\n\n363\n00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:41.450\nThat's not what they meant it for,\nbut you can illustrate, as we will,\n\n364\n00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.420\nwhen we get deeper into things.\n\n365\n00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:47.780\nYou can illustrate the fact that a lot\nof cryptographic techniques were used\n\n366\n00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.790\nto reveal what hieroglyphics were,\njust like other civilizations.\n\n367\n00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:57.480\nTheir languages were lost, we're able\nto use the same types of logic and\n\n368\n00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.230\ntechniques to reveal those messages too.\n\n369\n00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:09.270\nIn some cases, a dead culture, basically\ncome back and reveal its secrets.\n\n370\n00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.320\n>> All right.\n\n371\n00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.207\nSo what do we want to talk about then as\nfar as the ancient world of cryptography?\n\n372\n00:21:14.207 --> 00:21:15.980\n>> There's a few.\n\n373\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.530\nOne of the one's I put on here, and I've\nalso got an example of on my screen just\n\n374\n00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:26.765\nbecause a lot of you heard about it\nin grade school, this is a cuneiform.\n\n375\n00:21:26.765 --> 00:21:30.653\nWhen this was written,\nthis was written on a clay tablet, and so\n\n376\n00:21:30.653 --> 00:21:35.776\nthat when the clay was wet, someone would\nactually go and etch these things into it.\n\n377\n00:21:35.776 --> 00:21:40.710\nNow they use a stylus or\nwhatever to put these characters in there.\n\n378\n00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:44.700\nWell, this was something that they didn't\nreally fully understand when they found\n\n379\n00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.110\nthese things, and they were actually\nslowly able to reverse engineer this\n\n380\n00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.990\nlanguage using what would be\nconsidered cryptographic techniques.\n\n381\n00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.050\nSo this would be from the Sumerian\nstuff like that in the Middle East.\n\n382\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.500\nThat's where this would come from.\n\n383\n00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:02.910\nSo if you remember cuneiform from grade\nschool if you were awake during that part,\n\n384\n00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:06.030\nthis is what cuneiform looks like,\nand this is only one example.\n\n385\n00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:10.180\nThere are plenty of examples\nof this around, I mean, heck.\n\n386\n00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.270\nJust like hieroglyphics,\n\n387\n00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:15.390\nyou can get pottery and other things\nwith this painted on it if you want.\n\n388\n00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.550\n>> All right.\nAnd then you've got Kama Sutra.\n\n389\n00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.190\n>> Yeah.\nI'm just making a book recommendation.\n\n390\n00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.940\nThis one, the Kama Sutra, there's a very\nspecific reason why I put this in here.\n\n391\n00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.610\nAnd I think it's just an interesting item.\n\n392\n00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:37.740\nBecause when most people think\nabout the Kama Sutra and\n\n393\n00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.650\nits subject matter,\nthey're thinking just of one thing.\n\n394\n00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.409\nAnd get your mind out of the gutter.\n\n395\n00:22:44.409 --> 00:22:45.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n396\n00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.740\nyou think of one specific thing\nwhen they think of the Kama Sutra.\n\n397\n00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.290\nThey think of it as one of those romance,\nwe'll just be nice and\n\n398\n00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.650\ncall it a romance guide.\n\n399\n00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.630\nThat's only a very small portion of it.\n\n400\n00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.730\nInterestingly enough,\nit's only one small portion of that\n\n401\n00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:03.120\nguide is all the stuff that you hear\nin movies and TV and stuff like that.\n\n402\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.230\nThat's there, but\nit's only a very small portion.\n\n403\n00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:10.430\nIf you think about the what that\nthe overall guide was designed for,\n\n404\n00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:14.880\nit was designed for lovers way back when\n\n405\n00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.660\nhaving affairs and all that could\n\n406\n00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:25.410\nin some cases get you in trouble,\nand they wanted to keep it private.\n\n407\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.830\nSo there was a section of\nthe Kama Sutra that you can go look up,\n\n408\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:33.880\nthere's a section of it that says how\nlovers can actually write stuff in code,\n\n409\n00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.950\nso they can just send messages back and\nforth that only they will understand.\n\n410\n00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.840\nSo it is something that is in there, but\n\n411\n00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:44.690\nit's not something that most\npeople associate with it.\n\n412\n00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.035\nYou go on Amazon, type in Kama Sutra,\n\n413\n00:23:46.035 --> 00:23:47.811\nyou're not going to get\na book on secret writing.\n\n414\n00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:50.736\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Trust me.\n\n415\n00:23:50.736 --> 00:23:53.243\nWell, you might, I don't know,\nthere might be something, but\n\n416\n00:23:53.243 --> 00:23:54.939\nthat's probably not a best seller either.\n\n417\n00:23:54.939 --> 00:23:58.174\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but there is a section of it if you\n\n418\n00:23:58.174 --> 00:24:02.947\nlook in the academic areas, you will find\na section that does say how to create or\n\n419\n00:24:02.947 --> 00:24:07.720\nhow to use hidden languages in there,\nwhich is just fascinating When I first saw\n\n420\n00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.563\nthat, I may have been like some of you,\nwhere I was like, well, that's a manual\n\n421\n00:24:12.563 --> 00:24:17.950\nand that's used for one thing, and it's\ngot pictures and all that stuff in there.\n\n422\n00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.770\nBut, no, there's more to it.\n\n423\n00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.435\nI know, I did a lot of research.\n\n424\n00:24:22.435 --> 00:24:23.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n425\n00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.430\n>> All right, well, I'll tell you what.\n\n426\n00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.630\nLooking at the clock, it's about time for\nus to take a quick break.\n\n427\n00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:32.725\nSo we're gonna step away, when we come\nback More cryptography, so stay tuned.\n\n428\n00:24:32.725 --> 00:24:37.769\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back,\n\n429\n00:24:37.769 --> 00:24:41.378\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n430\n00:24:41.378 --> 00:24:44.439\nSo we left off Sean talking about\nsome of the types of encryption, or\n\n431\n00:24:44.439 --> 00:24:48.037\nsome forms of cryptography I guess,\nthat we've seen in the ancient world, and\n\n432\n00:24:48.037 --> 00:24:51.240\nwe got a few more that we wanted\nto discuss as well, right?\n\n433\n00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.030\nYeah, there's quite a few\nmore we can discuss,\n\n434\n00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.640\nbecause they're going to\ncome into play later on.\n\n435\n00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.890\nI can't help but think during that break,\nbetween those two episodes,\n\n436\n00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:03.730\nAmazon's traffic went through the roof\nwith people doing Kama Sutra searches.\n\n437\n00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:06.276\nThat's why it was so dead here.\n\n438\n00:25:06.276 --> 00:25:10.460\n[LAUGH] But, anyway, and\n\n439\n00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:16.260\nthe next type of cryptographic system that\nwe want to talk about is gonna come in\n\n440\n00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.960\nto play again later on big time.\n\n441\n00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.740\nSo I'm gonna spend a little time on it.\n\n442\n00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.930\nIt's one called the Caesar cipher.\n\n443\n00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:31.140\nIt's not something that was brand\nnew when it was introduced.\n\n444\n00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:36.330\nI mean trust me it was named after Julius\nCaesar cuz he was the most famous and\n\n445\n00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:37.820\nwell known user of it.\n\n446\n00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.980\nBut there were other people\nthat used it before.\n\n447\n00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:45.710\nIt's just because of, hey,\nyou use a cryptographic system or\n\n448\n00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:50.623\ninvent a really good salad type and\nyou're gonna get your name on it.\n\n449\n00:25:50.623 --> 00:25:52.324\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So in this case,\n\n450\n00:25:52.324 --> 00:25:53.750\nhe got the Caesar cipher.\n\n451\n00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.760\n>> Both.\n>> Yeah, he got both.\n\n452\n00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.650\nThere you go.\n\n453\n00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.175\nAnd he got a casino named after him too.\n\n454\n00:25:59.175 --> 00:26:01.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you get certain things.\n\n455\n00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.550\n>> What happens when you rule\na known world at a time, yeah.\n\n456\n00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.297\n>> Yes\n>> We'll name a casino after you.\n\n457\n00:26:07.297 --> 00:26:12.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyway, when we talk about the Caesar\n\n458\n00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:17.870\ncipher, it's actually a form of a system\nwhich I've got up here on screen.\n\n459\n00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.695\nIt's It's just a basic\nsubstitution cypher,\n\n460\n00:26:20.695 --> 00:26:24.990\ncuz what we're doing is we have,\nup top we have our regular alphabet,\n\n461\n00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.850\nwhat we call our plain text,\nwhich is unencrypted.\n\n462\n00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.650\nAnd then we have at the bottom,\nwe have a shifted, or pseudo-alphabet,\n\n463\n00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:35.150\nthey sometimes call it a crypto-alphabet,\nwhich means, what they're doing is they're\n\n464\n00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.920\ntaking the regular alphabet and kinda\njust shifting it over a number of spaces.\n\n465\n00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.220\nIn this case, the Caesar cipher\nalways shifted over three no matter\n\n466\n00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.410\nWhat you are talking about, okay?\n\n467\n00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.340\nNow, I just simply go ahead and use,\n\n468\n00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.480\nyou know, the English language,\nto, to make it nice and\n\n469\n00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.470\neasy to understand, you know, if I put\na bunch of weird characters up there.\n\n470\n00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:58.360\nNow, now all of the sudden I gotta teach,\nyou know,\n\n471\n00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.060\nan ancient language or something\n[LAUGH] and that ain't gonna work.\n\n472\n00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:06.500\nSo they're using the English language\nwhere we've shifted the letters over\n\n473\n00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.730\nthree spaces.\n\n474\n00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:12.340\nAnd so what happens is that when\nyou want to translate, you know,\n\n475\n00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:17.850\nfrom your plain text to your cyber text,\nyou just write your regular message and\n\n476\n00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.630\nthen shift every letter over\nthree spaces to the right.\n\n477\n00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.190\nAnd you replace the current\nletter with that letter.\n\n478\n00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:29.390\nAnd just proceed, go right on down\nthe list doing that until you're done.\n\n479\n00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.070\nAnd so really, really, really simple.\n\n480\n00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:35.010\nAnd do decrypt you just\nreverse the process.\n\n481\n00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.120\nYou take the cypher text and\n\n482\n00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.020\ngo three spaces to the left to\nget back the original plain text.\n\n483\n00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.260\nDoesn't really get any simpler than that.\n\n484\n00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:49.310\nIt's not even considered a complex\nsystem by today's standards,\n\n485\n00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:50.460\nhowever it is still used.\n\n486\n00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.150\nAnd we'll talk about that and\nwhy, when we get later on.\n\n487\n00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.690\n>> I have my Dora\nthe Explorer decoder ring.\n\n488\n00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:00.110\n>> It's funny that you mention that,\nbecause yeah, that's where a lot of people\n\n489\n00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:04.650\nsaw it the first time, was on the back\nof a cereal box, or those decoder rings\n\n490\n00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.500\nthat you twist the thing\n>> Exactly.\n\n491\n00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.270\nThat's where you saw them.\n\n492\n00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.480\n>> It is the basis for\na few different algorithms, I think,\n\n493\n00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:15.060\nthat we're going to talk about,\nlike ROT13 and a few others.\n\n494\n00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.430\nVery simplistic, but\n\n495\n00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:20.130\nin it's day it did a pretty good\njob of keeping messages secret.\n\n496\n00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:21.980\n>> Yeah.\nIn fact, you mentioned ROT13, and\n\n497\n00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.580\nROT13 is the exact same thing.\n\n498\n00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.010\nInstead of doing three, you do 13.\n\n499\n00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:26.860\n>> Yeah.\nJust rotating 13 letters, and\n\n500\n00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.830\nI, I kid about Dora, I use Dora because\nthat's more modern times I think,\n\n501\n00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.670\nbut mine was a Captain Crunch decoder\nring, and that's basically all it was.\n\n502\n00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:38.230\nYou turn the little dial, if you wanted\nan A, and it told you to write an M, or\n\n503\n00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:41.790\nwhatever the case may be,\nyou were just shifting the letters over.\n\n504\n00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.020\nVery simplistic, but\n\n505\n00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.790\nif you didn't know how many to shift,\nit was difficult to decipher.\n\n506\n00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.310\nYeah, at least at the time,\n\n507\n00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:54.630\nusing something like this would be\nconsidered to be difficult to do.\n\n508\n00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.310\nReason why, just to go back\non why it was being used and\n\n509\n00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.290\nwhy Caesar was associated with it.\n\n510\n00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:03.890\nWhen he was in And when he was in\nhis general phase, and he had his\n\n511\n00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:08.190\ncommanders in the field, he used this to\nsend messages back and forth all the time.\n\n512\n00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.750\nAnd they all knew what to do when they\ngot it, how to send messages back,\n\n513\n00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:16.830\nto do that shift, to write their message,\nand then shift it a certain way,\n\n514\n00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:20.690\nor shift it the other way to get\nthe message back out in encrypted form.\n\n515\n00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.780\nIf you didn't know that little secret,\n\n516\n00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.740\nwhich back at the time this was\nstill kind of a foreign concept,\n\n517\n00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.730\nyou were going to see something that\njust looked like garbage or you thought.\n\n518\n00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:33.250\nAnd you know the way the Romans were.\n\n519\n00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.660\nThe Romans had this reputation,\nat the time, as being, well,\n\n520\n00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.670\nif you're not in the Roman Empire,\nyou're a barbarian and uneducated.\n\n521\n00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:44.200\nWho cares, that's what they were\nhoping you would tend to think,\n\n522\n00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.360\nis that someone wrote this.\n\n523\n00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.190\nAnd since you didn't understand it,\nor it's in some weird pattern,\n\n524\n00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:53.180\nyou'd be like oh, some peasant or\nbarbarian did this, and you'd chuck it.\n\n525\n00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.440\nThat could also be it.\n\n526\n00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.180\nSo that was very effective.\n\n527\n00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:03.160\nNot to mention, literacy rates were\nlower outside of the Roman empire,\n\n528\n00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.720\nso chances of anyone being able to read\nthat in the first place encrypted or\n\n529\n00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.520\nunencrypted is quite low.\n\n530\n00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:16.029\nSo it was used for a long,\nlong time even after Caesar met his\n\n531\n00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:24.270\nfate on the Ides of March, it still was\nbeing used for quite awhile in the Empire.\n\n532\n00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:29.090\nIn fact they said he was so good at\nit that he could translate both ways.\n\n533\n00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:31.050\nJust by having the tablet\nin front of them.\n\n534\n00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:32.230\nYou didn't even have to write it down.\n\n535\n00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.130\nYou would just look at it.\n\n536\n00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:37.540\nAnd you could just go right back and forth\nmentally without any effort whatsoever.\n\n537\n00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.910\n>> I guess if you do it enough you\nstart learning the patterns and\n\n538\n00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.960\nyou don't even need a decryption ring.\n\n539\n00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.045\n>> Yeah you don't need that.\n\n540\n00:30:44.045 --> 00:30:47.361\n>> [LAUGH] And then another one\nthat's really cool I think.\n\n541\n00:30:47.361 --> 00:30:49.000\n>> It's just different from\nother things that we see,\n\n542\n00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.726\nis this next one you want to talk about.\n\n543\n00:30:50.726 --> 00:30:55.870\n>> Yeah, this next one,\nI agree this next one on the list is,\n\n544\n00:30:55.870 --> 00:31:00.820\nsometimes people look at it,\nit looks like it's spelled cytail.\n\n545\n00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.060\nThat's the way it looks.\n\n546\n00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:08.550\nIt's spelled\n>> S-C-Y-T-A-L-E, but\n\n547\n00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:12.230\nit's actually pronounced scytale,\nlike Italy.\n\n548\n00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.550\nSo this is kinda what it looks like.\n\n549\n00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:19.530\nAnd this is just one of\nthe forms that it could take.\n\n550\n00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.390\nAnd the way you use this\nsystem is you had that\n\n551\n00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.190\nwooden dowel that you see\ndown the middle of that.\n\n552\n00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:28.990\nAnd that would be a certain diameter, and\nthen what you would do is you would wrap\n\n553\n00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:34.190\na leather strap or whatever you were\ngonna write on around that shaft.\n\n554\n00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:41.000\nAnd then you just write your message\ndown across the, across the length\n\n555\n00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.920\nof that dowel and then what you do when\nyou're done, you just unwrap that and\n\n556\n00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:51.520\ntake that leather strap and throw it\nsomeplace in a package or whatever.\n\n557\n00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.650\nAnd that would get carried to wherever,\nand\n\n558\n00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:57.000\nthen someone would take the same diameter,\nand that's the important thing.\n\n559\n00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.928\nThey got to have the same diameter dowel\nto wrap that strap around to be able to\n\n560\n00:32:01.928 --> 00:32:06.015\ndecipher the message,\notherwise the things will not line up.\n\n561\n00:32:06.015 --> 00:32:08.220\nAnd so that's how the system worked.\n\n562\n00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:12.712\nAnd you can see if you didn't want someone\nto be able to read Intercepted message.\n\n563\n00:32:12.712 --> 00:32:17.717\nAll you have to do is just, if you don't\nwanna use that particular system anymore,\n\n564\n00:32:17.717 --> 00:32:21.340\nyou can take that dowel,\njust break it over your knee.\n\n565\n00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.180\nDone, just trade another one\nwith a different diameter.\n\n566\n00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.000\nSo very very simple system.\n\n567\n00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.230\nAnd it was pretty widely used.\n\n568\n00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:34.550\nThis is actually the one that people\nclosely associate with the Spartans.\n\n569\n00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:39.724\nThe Spartans were using this, and this\nwas something that was actually in use\n\n570\n00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:44.915\nat the time of events like the battle\nof Thermopole, that they saw in 300.\n\n571\n00:32:44.915 --> 00:32:47.750\nThey were still widely used at\nthat point in time, and so.\n\n572\n00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.780\n>> Yeah, and\njust to make sure you guys are clear,\n\n573\n00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:55.140\nthat picture that Sean has shown there,\nlike the G-U-S-T-I-N-H-A, that's where\n\n574\n00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.460\nyou're writing the message, and you can\nsee the way that's wrapped around there.\n\n575\n00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.040\nWhen that's unwrapped, those letters\nare no longer going to line up, right?\n\n576\n00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.970\nAnd if you wrapped it around\nsomething of a different diameter\n\n577\n00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.330\nthen the letters are going\nto line up differently.\n\n578\n00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:11.525\nSo only if you knew the diameter of\ndowel used, could you decrypt that.\n\n579\n00:33:11.525 --> 00:33:12.920\nSupposedly, I mean that was the idea.\n\n580\n00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.010\n>> That was the idea and\nit did work pretty well.\n\n581\n00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:17.420\nIt worked really,\nreally well as a matter of fact.\n\n582\n00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:21.410\nI mean you can imagine the things you\ncould do with that strap too, to hide it.\n\n583\n00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:24.600\nYou could use it as a belt or something\non your weapons or what have you.\n\n584\n00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.400\nWrap it around something, it would look\nlike an inconspicuous part of whatever.\n\n585\n00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.210\nSomeone would have to deliberately\nsearch for that to find it.\n\n586\n00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:36.830\nAnd then once they found it\nthey'd have to, like you said,\n\n587\n00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:42.350\nfigure out what the diameter of dowel\nwas to actually make this work.\n\n588\n00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.760\nAnd then on top of that,\nthe person that was carrying that,\n\n589\n00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:51.150\nthey may just be a courier, so\nno matter what you did to them,\n\n590\n00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:54.240\nthey don't have the actual dowel,\nand they can't tell you,\n\n591\n00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.935\nwhat are they gonna do in the ancient\nworld, going, oh it's about this big.\n\n592\n00:33:56.935 --> 00:33:59.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, they can't do that, so\n\n593\n00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:01.920\nit's just gonna be tough.\n\n594\n00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.180\nJust to kinda point something out here\non this one and the Caesar cypher,\n\n595\n00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.750\nthe previous example.\n\n596\n00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:11.430\nCaesar cipher was a substitution cipher\nwhere you took one character and\n\n597\n00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:13.240\nsubstituted for something else.\n\n598\n00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.780\nThis one we are not actually\nsubstituting anything.\n\n599\n00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.880\nThe message is still there,\nthe letters are still there in the exact\n\n600\n00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.520\nform they were when they\nwere rendered originally.\n\n601\n00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.502\nIt's just that we are [CROSSTALK] able to,\nwe're changing the position of them,\n\n602\n00:34:27.502 --> 00:34:32.115\nbecause of that dowel, depending on\nhow thick or how narrow that dowel is,\n\n603\n00:34:32.115 --> 00:34:34.850\nthose letters will line up different ways.\n\n604\n00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:38.535\nSo transposition actually\nchanges the position of things,\n\n605\n00:34:38.535 --> 00:34:42.180\ninstead of actually encoding\nthe actual data itself.\n\n606\n00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:45.360\nSo, that's an important\ndetail that you can actually,\n\n607\n00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.870\nlater on when we start talking\nabout transposition ciphers and\n\n608\n00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:52.230\nsubstitution cyphers, you can actually\nvisualize them right now cuz you can go,\n\n609\n00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:56.466\noh yeah substitution cypher, that's\nCaesar, transposition, that's Scytale.\n\n610\n00:34:56.466 --> 00:34:58.710\nI remember the dowel\nwith all that in there.\n\n611\n00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.824\nIt's one of the reasons why we're\ndoing this trip down memory lane.\n\n612\n00:35:01.824 --> 00:35:04.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I guess if you wanna call it that.\n\n613\n00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.690\n>> Very good.\n\n614\n00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:08.750\nAll right, then we move on in\ntowards the Revolutionary War, and\n\n615\n00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.790\nagain, more examples of\npeople using cryptography.\n\n616\n00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:16.767\n>> Yes, and the Revolutionary War there\nwas a, there's some interesting things\n\n617\n00:35:16.767 --> 00:35:20.788\nthat happened here during\nthe Revolutionary War here in the US.\n\n618\n00:35:20.788 --> 00:35:27.557\nCryptography was used by a lot of the\nmajor players both on the British side and\n\n619\n00:35:27.557 --> 00:35:32.140\non the Colonial side, and\nmessages would go back and\n\n620\n00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.970\nforth, and they would be intercepted.\n\n621\n00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:40.420\nAnd in fact, in the case of\nthe Revolutionary War, there was,\n\n622\n00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:44.910\nthe way messages were decrypted,\nwas on our side,\n\n623\n00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:48.315\non the US side, or\nwhat would become the US side.\n\n624\n00:35:48.315 --> 00:35:50.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was actually interpreted by\n\n625\n00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.830\nthe clergy, so there's people\non the clergy that were actually\n\n626\n00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:59.650\ngetting British messages and\ntaking the time to read it and\n\n627\n00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:05.320\ndecode them so they could be provided\nas intelligence to people in the field.\n\n628\n00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.950\nSo it was really, really fascinating.\n\n629\n00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:12.680\nIn fact I note in the book even, some of\npeople that were doing that decryption or\n\n630\n00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.530\nworking on these crypto systems around\nthe time, the Revolutionary War,\n\n631\n00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.030\nthey became significant people in history.\n\n632\n00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:25.350\nSome of them may be infamous, I don't\nknow, but depending how you look at it.\n\n633\n00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:26.950\nBenedict Arnold was a user of it.\n\n634\n00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:29.800\nWe know his story.\n\n635\n00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.050\nThen we also know about or\nwell I shouldn't say we know about, but\n\n636\n00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.500\nindirectly you may know about it,\nespecially if you took any\n\n637\n00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.130\ngovernment courses or\nanything here in the US in high school,\n\n638\n00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.810\nyou know about a process,\nwhat, gerrymandering?\n\n639\n00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:47.996\nThere was a guy, I forget his first name,\nbut his last name was Gerry,\n\n640\n00:36:47.996 --> 00:36:51.073\nG-E-R-R-Y.\n\n641\n00:36:51.073 --> 00:36:54.300\nThe process of gerrymandering\ncame from him, but\n\n642\n00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:59.270\nhe also was somebody that\nworked on breaking messages.\n\n643\n00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:01.040\nSo there were some interesting people.\n\n644\n00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.740\nI think Franklin worked on them, and\nthere was a few other people that worked\n\n645\n00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.870\non crypto systems at the time\nof the Revolutionary War.\n\n646\n00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:14.020\nAnd if I remember correctly,\nIt was actually involved when they\n\n647\n00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.230\ncaught Benedict Arnold they were\nable to get some other messages and\n\n648\n00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.590\nfigure out what was going on.\n\n649\n00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:23.310\nBy today's standards, the systems would be\nvery simple, but they worked for the time.\n\n650\n00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.720\n>> And I know you've got in here,\nMary the Queen of Scots.\n\n651\n00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.950\n>> Yeah, this story of Mary,\nQueen of Scots is\n\n652\n00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:38.050\njust one of those things in\nthe world of cryptography, and\n\n653\n00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:43.020\nit actually does have some good examples\nof cryptography all embedded through it,\n\n654\n00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.400\nplenty of them that shows\nsome of the faults in it,\n\n655\n00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:50.310\nas well some of the developments\nthat they've had later on.\n\n656\n00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:54.070\nBasically the situation\nwas here is that we had\n\n657\n00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:58.270\nqueen typing was Victoria,\nmaybe it was Elizabeth at the time.\n\n658\n00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:59.540\nI get a little bit messed up.\n\n659\n00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.732\nSomebody, right now, is Googling it.\n\n660\n00:38:01.732 --> 00:38:02.638\n>> [LAUGH] They'll let you know.\n>> Right now.\n\n661\n00:38:02.638 --> 00:38:03.844\nYeah, so.\n\n662\n00:38:03.844 --> 00:38:08.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we had Mary Queen of Scots,\n\n663\n00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:12.450\nwho had a legitimate claim\nto the throne of England and\n\n664\n00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:17.130\nyou had on the British side,\nI'll just say it was Queen Elizabeth.\n\n665\n00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.002\nWe'll go with that one.\n\n666\n00:38:19.002 --> 00:38:20.109\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think that's it.\n\n667\n00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:21.170\nThat's what I wanna say.\n\n668\n00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:22.890\n>> But if it's not it is now.\n\n669\n00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:29.040\nBut what happened is that Mary Queen\nof Scots had a legitimate claim\n\n670\n00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.830\nand so\nQueen Elizabeth went through a lot of kind\n\n671\n00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:40.240\nof back behind-the-scenes wrangling and\nall that, see right there boom,\n\n672\n00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:46.505\na lot of behind-the-scenes\nwrangling had her imprisoned.\n\n673\n00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:49.300\nAt that time-\n>> It was Elizabeth I.\n\n674\n00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.351\nYeah, I was just looking at it,\nElizabeth I.\n\n675\n00:38:52.351 --> 00:38:53.130\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n676\n00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:57.960\nthey had her actually imprisoned because\nyou didn't just go around at that\n\n677\n00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.810\ntime nad kill somebody of royalty or\nwhatever.\n\n678\n00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:07.100\nWell I guess it did still happen, but\nyou had to be very careful about it,\n\n679\n00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.100\nvery discrete about it.\n\n680\n00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.540\nSomebody like Mary you\njust didn't go through and\n\n681\n00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.835\njust go I'm taking off\nyour head that's it.\n\n682\n00:39:12.835 --> 00:39:14.590\nYou'd better find a really good reason for\nit.\n\n683\n00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:15.940\nNow Elizabeth didn't have that,\n\n684\n00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:20.650\nother then the fact that there was\nthis claim to the throne of England.\n\n685\n00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:26.900\nWell, when she was imprisoned,\nshe tried sending messages out to her\n\n686\n00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:32.260\npeople in the field to organize\nresistance, or whatever, to the throne.\n\n687\n00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.710\nWell, those were intercepted.\n\n688\n00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:38.410\nAnd the way they were intercepted,\nis Mary was putting them inside\n\n689\n00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:42.080\ncaskets of whiskey or something like that.\n\n690\n00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.220\nIt was some sort of alcohol.\n\n691\n00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.660\nAnd they were being taken out of\nthe castle where she was being held.\n\n692\n00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.320\nAnd they got intercepted, they were\npulling the messages out of those things,\n\n693\n00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.990\ndeciphering them, and\nthen just putting them back in there and\n\n694\n00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:56.560\ntracking them back to where they would go,\nto get those people.\n\n695\n00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.800\nSo not only would they\nknow what was happening,\n\n696\n00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.920\nthey could also figure out who was in\non these plots, and all her scheming.\n\n697\n00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:07.581\nAnd when they had enough evidence\nthat she is doing this sort of thing,\n\n698\n00:40:07.581 --> 00:40:11.619\nthey were able to say,\nhey yeah we're taking off your head.\n\n699\n00:40:11.619 --> 00:40:12.874\nThat was essentially what happened.\n\n700\n00:40:12.874 --> 00:40:15.837\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And Queen Elizabeth didn't hesitate.\n\n701\n00:40:15.837 --> 00:40:21.583\nThey brought her up on On trial,\nput the charges of treason and\n\n702\n00:40:21.583 --> 00:40:28.020\nsedition all against her, and\nMary lost her head as a result.\n\n703\n00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:32.600\nOne of the interesting players\nin this was the individual\n\n704\n00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:37.450\nthat actually was responsible for\nbreaking those message.\n\n705\n00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:44.560\nThe guy was by even by today's standards\nhe'd be considered pretty darn smart.\n\n706\n00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.780\nNot only did he know how\nto do codebreaking, and\n\n707\n00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.850\ncould he figure out things, the guy also\nknew I think like five or six languages.\n\n708\n00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:56.720\nAnd he got the title\nDecipherer of The Realm or\n\n709\n00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.780\nsomething like that,\nas a result of his type of things.\n\n710\n00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:06.340\nAnd he had a prominent role to\nplay in the British Empire for\n\n711\n00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:11.340\nquite a while under Elizabeth\nto be sure and then after that.\n\n712\n00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.670\nAnd then some of the things that he did,\nbecause he actually had,\n\n713\n00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:18.450\nwe'll say an office or area or\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n714\n00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:21.890\nThat he did his research and stuff like\nthat in and took the messages to and\n\n715\n00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:23.360\nwent through all the stuff.\n\n716\n00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.590\nHe had an area that he did this in.\n\n717\n00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:29.180\nSomething that still persists to this day.\n\n718\n00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.530\nSo it's just a fascinating,\nyou know, type of thing.\n\n719\n00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:35.790\nIn fact,\nthe place where this individual, and\n\n720\n00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:40.170\nI'm forgetting his name, it's actually\njust going out of my head right now.\n\n721\n00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:44.680\nIs the stuff that they created was\nthe foundation of something later\n\n722\n00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:49.380\non called a Black Chamber and\nthese things still exist to this day.\n\n723\n00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:54.000\nThey call them different things now,\nbut the first formal one was in Vienna,\n\n724\n00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.090\nAustria around,\nkind of around the same time.\n\n725\n00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.160\nA Black Chamber was called that.\n\n726\n00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.910\nIt was an area you know where they did\ncode breaking and this sort of thing.\n\n727\n00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:05.710\nIt was known for that.\n\n728\n00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.850\nWe saw these things for\nyears called black chambers.\n\n729\n00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:12.320\nAll the way up to around\nthe time of the first world war.\n\n730\n00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.310\nNow they'll call them\nsomething different than that.\n\n731\n00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:21.700\nI guess it seems a little too ominous or\na little too mysterious or whatever.\n\n732\n00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:26.580\nWhich I've always wondered since the term\nblack chamber was around for a while and\n\n733\n00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.090\nit was introduced.\n\n734\n00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:30.920\nI wonder if that was,\n\n735\n00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.690\nif that's why the NSA has that big\nblack [LAUGH] building out there.\n\n736\n00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:35.970\nIt's kind of like a hint,\nthe black chamber.\n\n737\n00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:39.090\nDon't call it the black chamber, but\nthen put a big black box on there and\n\n738\n00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.430\njust polish it up really nicely.\n\n739\n00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:45.000\nBut that was what\nMary Queen of Scotts did.\n\n740\n00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.580\nThat's some of the developments around\nthat had repercussions later on.\n\n741\n00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.810\nSomething I also note in the book as\na piece of trivia to it was that,\n\n742\n00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.170\nyou know, Mary got her head taken off.\n\n743\n00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.290\nElizabeth didn't have any male heirs.\n\n744\n00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:01.740\nSo, later on,\ndown the road after Elizabeth passed away,\n\n745\n00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.810\nMary's son actually took\ncontrol the throne.\n\n746\n00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:10.760\nEven though it took some time to do it,\neventually, when somebody of her family\n\n747\n00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:15.400\nat least got the throne, I don't know if\nthat's the type of victory you wanna have.\n\n748\n00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.312\nLike, oh, I'm dead but\none of my descendants got it but.\n\n749\n00:43:18.312 --> 00:43:18.907\n>> Right.\n\n750\n00:43:18.907 --> 00:43:21.530\n[LAUGH]\n>> I guess she was playing it long term\n\n751\n00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.390\nstrategy\n>> I don't know.\n\n752\n00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.720\nOr didn't turn out the way she thought.\n\n753\n00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.600\n>> Alright.\n\n754\n00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:31.090\nAnd then we've got some additional\nexamples in the Confederate States.\n\n755\n00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:32.590\n>> Yeah.\nThe Confederate States, you know,\n\n756\n00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:37.080\nwe're talking around the time of the U.S.\ncivil war or during the Civil War,\n\n757\n00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.490\nthe confederate states and the Union,\nthey both had their own crypto systems.\n\n758\n00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:43.540\nIt developed, and\nthey were using some older ones.\n\n759\n00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.580\nIn fact, on the Confederate side,\nthe one they were using was a,\n\n760\n00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:53.580\nwe could almost say it's an advanced\nversion of the Caesar cipher.\n\n761\n00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.940\nIt's one that, I think.\n\n762\n00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.260\nI didn't look at the puzzle.\n\n763\n00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:56.940\nDid you?\n\n764\n00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.480\nCaesar used the Vigenere.\n\n765\n00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.638\n>> They did the Vigenere.\n\n766\n00:43:59.638 --> 00:44:04.150\n>> Yeah, the Vigenere cipher is\nthe one that the Confederacy used.\n\n767\n00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:08.210\nDuring the Civil War, they used a lot.\n\n768\n00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:13.520\nAnd the Vigenere cipher was effective for\nabout 200 years,more or less.\n\n769\n00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.160\nAnd around the time of the Civil War\nit was already being broken with,\n\n770\n00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.380\nit took some time, but\nthey could break it.\n\n771\n00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:24.310\nThey had these little devices that\nwere brass discs with another brass\n\n772\n00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:29.550\ndisc set inside of it that you could spin,\nand the letters would line up accordingly.\n\n773\n00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:34.010\nSo someone could take that thing, and\ntake an encrypted message with the right\n\n774\n00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:40.120\nkeyword, and just use that to\ngo ahead an decrypt a message.\n\n775\n00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:47.650\nAnd, in fact, if you look back at the time\nor you look at recollections of US Grant.\n\n776\n00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:49.920\nHe made a comment about that.\n\n777\n00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:56.650\nThat the intelligence he got from breaking\nmessages, not all of it was valuable.\n\n778\n00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:58.840\nBut, it's not all of it, but\n\n779\n00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:03.670\nthere was a good amount that actually\nhelped him plan his troop movements.\n\n780\n00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:08.210\nAnd it got to be even more useful\ntowards the end of the war when\n\n781\n00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:13.168\nthe confederacy got to be lazier or\nthe people who had\n\n782\n00:45:13.168 --> 00:45:18.050\nmore experienced had passed on.\n\n783\n00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:19.580\nOkay, they were killed,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n784\n00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.370\n>> So those people were just no longer\n\n785\n00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:21.930\navailable.\n\n786\n00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.950\nSo you had people on the Union\nside able to break these things,\n\n787\n00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:28.700\njust issued these things to go through and\nhey, you know,\n\n788\n00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:32.010\ngive me a couple hours and I'll break\nthis message, and boom, here ya go.\n\n789\n00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:37.280\nAnd a couple hours wasn't a big deal back\nthen considering that war moved fast,\n\n790\n00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.820\nbut two hours wouldn't work nowadays.\n\n791\n00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:45.810\nIt just wouldn't, but it did work quite\neffectively then, and it did have some\n\n792\n00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:50.660\nimpact, and some say it really actually\nshortened the war, which they've credited\n\n793\n00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:56.310\nseveral wars with cryptography being\nshortened, but it's a fascinating thing.\n\n794\n00:45:56.310 --> 00:46:00.850\n>> You really start to see war as\na driving factor for cryptography itself.\n\n795\n00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:04.280\nComing up with new ways to hide\nsecrets to keep it from the enemy.\n\n796\n00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.890\nBecause we've gotta transmit messages, and\nthe bad guys are always out there trying\n\n797\n00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:10.350\nto intercept those messages,\nand I don't want them to.\n\n798\n00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:15.350\nSo just an example of a period of time\nwhen you're in war, and you've gotta keep\n\n799\n00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:18.280\nthat information secret and\nyou know people are trying to get into it.\n\n800\n00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.100\nWhich is what we do today\nwith cryptography, right?\n\n801\n00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:24.220\nWe've got important documents, or\nfinancial records, or health records,\n\n802\n00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.000\nor whatever.\n\n803\n00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.790\nThat we've gotta keep secrets so\nit works out and\n\n804\n00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:31.770\nwas a big driver in the development\nof new cryptographic methods and\n\n805\n00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:34.086\nmeans to keep that information safe.\n\n806\n00:46:34.086 --> 00:46:40.180\n>> Yeah, always played a huge role\nin development of cryptography.\n\n807\n00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:43.590\n>> You see around the times of\nany of these major conflicts,\n\n808\n00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.900\neither Revolutionary War,\nCivil War, World War one,\n\n809\n00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:51.170\ntwo you see that there's these\nmajor jumps right around that time.\n\n810\n00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:53.410\nNot necessarily right during the war.\n\n811\n00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.200\nBut during the war and before and\n\n812\n00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:59.560\nafter you see these massive jumps\nin cryptographic technology.\n\n813\n00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:04.670\nBecause of the fact that both\nsides know that the other is\n\n814\n00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:09.910\npassing secrets in code, and to get an\nadvantage they have to break those codes.\n\n815\n00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.450\nBut at the same time they got to\ndo something to keep theirs from\n\n816\n00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:13.740\nbeing broken.\n\n817\n00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:18.950\nAnd it's a fascinating thing if you look\nthrough any of these major upheavals like\n\n818\n00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:24.180\nthat, that you will see that\ncryptography had these surges and\n\n819\n00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.800\nthese valleys in between potentially,\nbetween conflicts.\n\n820\n00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.490\nAn then there were conflicts\nthat never even played a role.\n\n821\n00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:32.620\nI mean, there's that.\n\n822\n00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:36.650\nThere's the one with,\nI also noted this one in the book,\n\n823\n00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:40.360\none of the people that you would expect\nin the ancient world to have used it,\n\n824\n00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.290\nthat conquered a massive amount\nof territory, was Genghis Khan.\n\n825\n00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:49.170\nGenghis Khan, they said he's an example\nof someone who never, ever used it.\n\n826\n00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:52.760\nThere's just zero evidence that he\nused it, even though you would suspect\n\n827\n00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:57.750\nsomebody that have control of that\nlarge of a chunk of a territory and\n\n828\n00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:02.070\nwent on this big spree of conquering\nalmost everything in sight.\n\n829\n00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:04.220\nIt would seem in place there.\n\n830\n00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:09.550\nBut the theory is that because he was\ndoing everything on horseback and moving\n\n831\n00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:14.390\njust so darn fast for that time period,\nit didn't matter if it past up in code.\n\n832\n00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:17.615\nBy the time you intercepted something it\nwould be like oh look there's a horse over\n\n833\n00:48:17.615 --> 00:48:18.891\nthere with its head coming off.\n\n834\n00:48:18.891 --> 00:48:19.973\nThat's about it.\n\n835\n00:48:19.973 --> 00:48:21.668\nThey were just too fast.\n\n836\n00:48:21.668 --> 00:48:26.596\nNowadays, I can't see anyone You know,\ndoing a conducting war,\n\n837\n00:48:26.596 --> 00:48:31.436\nany type of thing like that without\nhaving some sort of codes being\n\n838\n00:48:31.436 --> 00:48:33.910\nused to hide important details.\n\n839\n00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:37.820\n>> He didn't have the same type of war\ntactics as we see in some of the other\n\n840\n00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:41.130\nones, it was just go kill everything and\ndo it quickly.\n\n841\n00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:41.730\n>> Yeah.\n\n842\n00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:47.670\nThey just moved with blinding\nspeed in mass and just went.\n\n843\n00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:50.990\nYou're right.\nJust hack and slash everything in view and\n\n844\n00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:53.120\nkeep going and going and going and going.\n\n845\n00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:53.790\nAnd so.\n\n846\n00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:58.150\n>> A piece of trivia for my buddy,\nthis is an ode to my buddy back in D.C.\n\n847\n00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:59.300\nwho happens to be Mongolian.\n\n848\n00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.680\nHe says, this Americans are saying\nthat wrong all this time.\n\n849\n00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.800\nIs is actually Genghis Khan.\n\n850\n00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.300\nSo just.\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n851\n00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:07.130\n>> Oh I know I have heard that before.\n\n852\n00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.740\nOkay.\n\n853\n00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.380\n>> But\nI still say Genghis Khan all the time.\n\n854\n00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.270\n>> We will fix that in post.\n\n855\n00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.560\nAll right, well, looking at the clock,\nladies and gentlemen, it's about time for\n\n856\n00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.120\nus to take a break.\n\n857\n00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.560\nSo we're gonna step away for a minute.\n\n858\n00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.492\nWhen we come back,\nmore cryptography, so stay tuned.\n\n859\n00:49:19.492 --> 00:49:28.150\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n860\n00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:30.400\nSo we left off talking about cryptography,\nand\n\n861\n00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.220\nsome of the roles that it\nplayed in ancient history.\n\n862\n00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:37.530\nAnd now we're gonna try to bring it up\na little bit into a more modern times, and\n\n863\n00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:41.330\nagain, we still see examples throughout\nhistory of where cryptography was used.\n\n864\n00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:44.000\nSo, what's something we want\nto talk about next, Sean?\n\n865\n00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.060\n>> Talking about the modern era,\n\n866\n00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.510\nthere's been a lot of\ndevelopments in the modern era.\n\n867\n00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:53.850\nAnd we're talking about from\nthe 1900s to today, there's been\n\n868\n00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:59.430\nsome big changes over that time period,\nwe could say everything from\n\n869\n00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:05.209\ncomputers to faster communications\nsuch as Internet and other things.\n\n870\n00:50:05.209 --> 00:50:09.640\nWe can say there was a lot\nof evolution going on here.\n\n871\n00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.830\nSo it's really an exciting time period.\n\n872\n00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:18.920\nAnd then you also get this transition\nfrom classical cryptography,\n\n873\n00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:24.450\nto start seeing some of the more modern\nstuff cropping up alongside of it.\n\n874\n00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:27.510\nAnd so a lot of neat things happening.\n\n875\n00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:32.890\nIn fact, if you look at it,\naround the 1900s, we started seeing,\n\n876\n00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:36.700\njust before Word War I, we started\nseeing some developments pop up.\n\n877\n00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:41.470\nOne of the bigger ones that\nwe saw was where the British\n\n878\n00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:46.270\nactually set up because they knew\nmainland Europe was a big powder keg.\n\n879\n00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:50.820\nLeading up to World War I, they just saw\nit and knew something was gonna happen.\n\n880\n00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.685\nIt was just a matter of what\nwas gonna be that spark.\n\n881\n00:50:53.685 --> 00:50:59.855\nAnd of course, when we had\nArchduke Ferdinand was assassinated.\n\n882\n00:50:59.855 --> 00:51:01.795\nThat tipped everything off.\n\n883\n00:51:01.795 --> 00:51:07.795\nWell, the British already knew that, so\nthey set up their own black chamber.\n\n884\n00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:15.120\nAnd we're prepared to do code breaking and\nprepared to intercept messages.\n\n885\n00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:20.900\nSo that played a big, big, big part\nbecause when the war started before the US\n\n886\n00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:25.890\nwriting entered, the British are over\nthere, they're already part of this and\n\n887\n00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:29.950\nthey're intercepting messages, and\nthey're decoding them, doing their thing.\n\n888\n00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:34.060\nWell, lo and behold, during that, the US\nis, and President Wilson's trying to\n\n889\n00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:38.990\nkeep us out of the war and\nkeep this policy of isolationism in place.\n\n890\n00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:42.287\nAnd be neutral,\nwell during this process, you know,\n\n891\n00:51:42.287 --> 00:51:46.660\none of the things that happened was\nthe British intercepted, you know,\n\n892\n00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:49.690\nsome messages that went\nover diplomatic cables.\n\n893\n00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:53.411\nAnd the reason why they were able to\nintercept those is because when the US\n\n894\n00:51:53.411 --> 00:51:57.376\nwas staying neutral it said, hey,\nanybody can use our cables to pass stuff,\n\n895\n00:51:57.376 --> 00:52:00.990\nour communication cables to\npass stuff back and forth.\n\n896\n00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:05.970\nBut the rules are that it can't be, that\nit can't encrypted or anything like that,\n\n897\n00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:08.080\nthey said, but any side can use it,\nwe're staying out of it.\n\n898\n00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.040\nYou know,\nwe'll allow everyone equal access.\n\n899\n00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:14.380\nWell, unbeknownst to us, and\nother people involved in it,\n\n900\n00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:16.820\nthe British actually\ntapped into those lines.\n\n901\n00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.260\nAnd had intercepted some messages.\n\n902\n00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:24.420\nAnd one of the ones they\nintercepted played a huge role.\n\n903\n00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:28.000\nThere's already things happening around\nthe same time like the sinking of\n\n904\n00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.070\nthe Lusitania because of Germany's policy\nof unrestricted submarine warfare.\n\n905\n00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:36.140\nBut then you also saw\nsomething that popped up, and\n\n906\n00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.430\nyou may remember it from your history\nclass, it's called the Zimmerman Note.\n\n907\n00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:44.510\nThe Zimmerman Note was something\nthat was sent from Germany\n\n908\n00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:49.520\nto Mexico to say well, if you tie up\n\n909\n00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:53.840\nthe United States cuz people knew it was\njust a matter of time before the U.S.\n\n910\n00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.350\ngot involved in the war, and they didn't\nwant the U.S. to get involved in the war.\n\n911\n00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:00.600\nSo they sent this message out.\n\n912\n00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:05.100\nThey told Mexico, hey,\nif you tie up the United States when we're\n\n913\n00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:08.610\ndone taking care of the rest of\npeople in Europe and Britain and\n\n914\n00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:13.560\nall that, we'll come over and\nstart messing with the Americans.\n\n915\n00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:17.680\nAnd then we'll give, once we have a\nsurrender of the US we'll give you certain\n\n916\n00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.110\nlands, we'll give you the lands\nthat they took from you.\n\n917\n00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:21.990\nWe'll give them back with a bonus I guess.\n\n918\n00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:25.140\nThey looked at,\nwell that message got to Mexico.\n\n919\n00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.210\nNothing ever really happened with\nit because when Mexico saw it\n\n920\n00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:32.250\nthey looked at it and\nwere pretty much immediately saying no\n\n921\n00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.970\nbecause they didn't want\nto get involved in this.\n\n922\n00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:39.495\nAnd on top of it the President of Mexico\nat the time was like we don't have\n\n923\n00:53:39.495 --> 00:53:43.725\nanywhere near the resources to engage\nthe U.S. anyway even if we wanted to.\n\n924\n00:53:43.725 --> 00:53:47.205\nBut because the message of\nthe stuff that was being tapped,\n\n925\n00:53:47.205 --> 00:53:52.202\nwhat I have on my screen is example,\nor is the Zimmerman note, so\n\n926\n00:53:52.202 --> 00:53:56.942\nwhat I've pulled up here is you\ncould see on the right hand side,\n\n927\n00:53:56.942 --> 00:54:01.610\nthat is what the regular,\nplain text message looked like.\n\n928\n00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:04.100\nOkay so and you can read that.\n\n929\n00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:04.890\nIt's all over the place.\n\n930\n00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:05.970\nYou don't need to read it here, but\n\n931\n00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:09.600\nyou can read that in a number\nof different places.\n\n932\n00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:15.590\nOn the left hand side,\nyou can see a telegram that's got,\n\n933\n00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:20.050\nso you can see in there it's going\nto the German office in Mexico.\n\n934\n00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:22.040\nThe diplomatic office.\n\n935\n00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.770\nOr in Mexico City.\n\n936\n00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:26.900\nAnd you see a bunch of sequences\nof numbers underneath that.\n\n937\n00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:32.330\nThat's a prime example, a very easy\nexample of what's known as using codes.\n\n938\n00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:36.925\nYou hear the terms codes and\nciphers used a lot.\n\n939\n00:54:36.925 --> 00:54:41.965\nCodes are not the same as\ndoing just regular encryption.\n\n940\n00:54:41.965 --> 00:54:46.225\nCodes mean that you are translating\nsomething to a specific sequence or\n\n941\n00:54:46.225 --> 00:54:49.875\nsomething other than what it regularly is.\n\n942\n00:54:49.875 --> 00:54:54.695\nSo what you see here is you see sequences\nof numbers representing actual words or\n\n943\n00:54:54.695 --> 00:54:59.010\nphrases, and so someone has a codebook\nthat they go through and takes\n\n944\n00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:03.670\nthe original message and translates that\noriginal message over into those codes.\n\n945\n00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:07.600\nSo the other side gets that and\nlooks at the correct code book, and\n\n946\n00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.750\ntakes those codes and\nreverses it back to the plain text.\n\n947\n00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:17.650\nThey actually did something really kind\nof, you look back, that's kind of funny.\n\n948\n00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:22.880\nThey thought cuz it kind of hints at\nthe stuff that happens today, even now,\n\n949\n00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:28.100\nis the British didn't want to reveal that\nthey'd actually tapped into those lines,\n\n950\n00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:31.265\nso what they did is they said,\noh look what we found.\n\n951\n00:55:31.265 --> 00:55:33.670\n[LAUGH] Was basically that type of thing.\n\n952\n00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:36.420\nThey're like,\noh look what we just happened to do, or\n\n953\n00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.350\njust happened to find laying around or\nsomething.\n\n954\n00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:42.560\nOr they found a way to leak it to the U.S.\nwithout revealing\n\n955\n00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:46.345\nthat they had actually broken this or\nhow they obtained it or anything.\n\n956\n00:55:46.345 --> 00:55:47.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n957\n00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:51.100\nit was one of those things that\nwas enough to just push the U.S.\n\n958\n00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.946\ninto it and say,\nyou're gonna do what now, and yeah.\n\n959\n00:55:53.946 --> 00:55:57.088\nSo that's the Zimmerman note\nif you've ever seen it,\n\n960\n00:55:57.088 --> 00:55:59.540\nit's another fascinating case.\n\n961\n00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:03.800\nBut, it was a major development\nbecause of the black chambers and\n\n962\n00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.640\nthe wire tapping of signals and\nthings like that that we.\n\n963\n00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.930\nHad seen only a little bit before.\n\n964\n00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:11.950\nYou had seen it, but not to this degree.\n\n965\n00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:17.067\nYou've seen wire tapping in the US\namazingly, when we were sending telegrams\n\n966\n00:56:17.067 --> 00:56:21.575\nback and forth and eventually\nthe telegram, they tapped the wires.\n\n967\n00:56:21.575 --> 00:56:26.056\nBut they weren't using a whole lot of\ncryptographic techniques for that.\n\n968\n00:56:26.056 --> 00:56:28.041\nThey were used, but not a lot.\n\n969\n00:56:28.041 --> 00:56:34.370\nHere, you see a whole organization\nset up to do precisely that.\n\n970\n00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:35.620\n>> Wow.\n\n971\n00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:39.900\nAnd that was all the way in WWI,\nand then it continues on to WWII.\n\n972\n00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.340\n>> Yeah, in WWII,\nwe saw the exact same thing.\n\n973\n00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:44.580\nThey kinda stopped calling\nthem Black Chambers and\n\n974\n00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:46.810\nchanged the name to something else.\n\n975\n00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:53.790\nThe British had that term Black Chamber,\nand it was a room or\n\n976\n00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:58.850\norganization number they changed it\nto be more formal and to not be as\n\n977\n00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:03.610\nobvious because the term Black Chamber, it\nhad been used quite a bit at that point.\n\n978\n00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:06.250\nSomething I also had to is hear\nthe term Black Chamber, oh,\n\n979\n00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:08.282\nthat's their code breaking organization.\n\n980\n00:57:08.282 --> 00:57:10.890\nSo they renamed it to something else,\n\n981\n00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:15.270\na little less conspicuous I guess\nif you want to put it that way.\n\n982\n00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:18.020\nSo that was a big development.\n\n983\n00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:23.170\nIn case you're wondering, just as a side\nnote to that why the US didn't have\n\n984\n00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:26.000\na Black Chamber around the time\nWorld War I was starting.\n\n985\n00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:28.840\nWell, it's kind of funny.\n\n986\n00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:32.590\nWe had one, but\nanybody that's here at US or\n\n987\n00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:36.610\nanybody worldwide will laugh at this now.\n\n988\n00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:40.440\nThe US had a black chamber doing code\nbreaking, cryptanalysis, and all that.\n\n989\n00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:45.510\nBut I believe it was\nWoodrow Wilson that sent\n\n990\n00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.120\nessentially an order out saying close it.\n\n991\n00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.928\nHe goes to read other people's messages,\nis ungentlemanlike.\n\n992\n00:57:52.928 --> 00:57:57.875\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, 70 years later.\n\n993\n00:57:57.875 --> 00:57:59.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n994\n00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:02.880\nyeah, it's just kind of a funny thing.\n\n995\n00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.490\nIt was something to that effect.\n\n996\n00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:08.190\nIt was not right, or\nwas ungentlemanly or something.\n\n997\n00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:10.430\nIt was just like oh, that's dishonorable,\n\n998\n00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:12.688\nyou can't read other\npeople's private messages.\n\n999\n00:58:12.688 --> 00:58:14.139\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1000\n00:58:14.139 --> 00:58:16.419\n>> Well, that's changed.\n\n1001\n00:58:16.419 --> 00:58:20.669\nSo that was just kind\nof a footnote to that.\n\n1002\n00:58:20.669 --> 00:58:24.702\nBut yeah, then World War II,\nthere was a lot of big,\n\n1003\n00:58:24.702 --> 00:58:28.370\nbig developments in all the theaters.\n\n1004\n00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:33.500\nAnd then the European Theatre we had the,\nand there were many, but\n\n1005\n00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:39.385\nwe have the ever popular Enigma\nmachine being passed around.\n\n1006\n00:58:39.385 --> 00:58:44.465\nThe Enigma machine actually existed,\nif you hadn't heard about this,\n\n1007\n00:58:44.465 --> 00:58:47.115\nthey actually existed prior\nto the Second World War.\n\n1008\n00:58:47.115 --> 00:58:50.785\nThe person that created it,\ncreated it for businesses and\n\n1009\n00:58:50.785 --> 00:58:54.965\naccounting, to use it for that to\nsend coded messages back and forth.\n\n1010\n00:58:54.965 --> 00:58:57.245\nThis is just one example\nof an Enigma machine.\n\n1011\n00:58:57.245 --> 00:59:00.300\nThere were actually several\ndifferent models of that.\n\n1012\n00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:01.810\nSo there's only a few.\n\n1013\n00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:04.590\nThis one you can see is\na four rotor design.\n\n1014\n00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:08.270\nIf you look up top, you see those\nlittle wheels sitting up there.\n\n1015\n00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:10.570\nYou set those to a specific setting, and\n\n1016\n00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:13.230\nthen you just start typing\nmessages on the bottom.\n\n1017\n00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:15.730\nAnd what would happen is the first wheel,\n\n1018\n00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:18.970\nevery time you pushed a button,\nit would move a notch.\n\n1019\n00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:22.640\nWhen it went one full revolution,\nthe next one would bump up a notch and\n\n1020\n00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.770\nevery time it did it, this would keep\ngoing over, and that same process.\n\n1021\n00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:28.260\nThis makes a full revolution,\nthe next one makes one notch.\n\n1022\n00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:30.780\nThis one makes a full revolution,\nthis one makes a notch.\n\n1023\n00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:36.830\nThat's just the way it worked, and so it\nhad this running key type deal going on.\n\n1024\n00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:38.550\nAnd those rotors could be taken out.\n\n1025\n00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:42.320\nThose rotors you could actually lift up\nthe top of those things and swap them out.\n\n1026\n00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.590\nThey were all numbered.\n\n1027\n00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:47.030\nSo when someone received this\none of these Enigma machines,\n\n1028\n00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:50.340\nwhat they would do was they had, probably\nwith this one, they originally had a box.\n\n1029\n00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:53.710\nMaybe like seven rotors and\nthey pop open the top of this.\n\n1030\n00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:59.620\nAnd they'd be told which rotors to put in\nat any point and time and how to set them.\n\n1031\n00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.250\nFor a specific instance, and\nthen they could start coding and\n\n1032\n01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:05.493\ndecoding messages on it, accordingly.\n\n1033\n01:00:05.493 --> 01:00:09.120\nThey had three rotors,\nfive rotors, seven rotors.\n\n1034\n01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.644\nThere was even rumor of something\nthat had 30 plus rotors in it.\n\n1035\n01:00:13.644 --> 01:00:14.820\n>> Wow.\n\n1036\n01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.900\n>> Which was never really\nused all that much.\n\n1037\n01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.830\nIt was just way too overkill.\n\n1038\n01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:23.210\nBut for this machine, yeah,\nyou'd set those rotors, and\n\n1039\n01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:27.070\nat the bottoms, most of these had\nwhat they called a plugboard.\n\n1040\n01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:29.700\nOn this one,\nit's down near the front of that keyboard.\n\n1041\n01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.660\nYou can see a little thing\nsticking out on there.\n\n1042\n01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.060\nYou'd drop that down,\nthere'd be a plugboard, and\n\n1043\n01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.650\nit's kind of like those things\nyou see in old movies where\n\n1044\n01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:41.190\nthe switchboard operators are doing\ndeals and connecting stuff.\n\n1045\n01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:44.600\nIt was the same thing, and they have\nto wire those things a certain way.\n\n1046\n01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.030\nAnd so it was a very effective machine.\n\n1047\n01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:52.910\nIt was broken because\nof a number of things.\n\n1048\n01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:55.030\nThere were some flaws in it.\n\n1049\n01:00:55.030 --> 01:01:00.380\nAlso the fact that Germany was\ndoing some manufacturing in Poland,\n\n1050\n01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.760\nprior to war breaking out.\n\n1051\n01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.150\nAnd so this was getting manufactured\nin pieces all over Poland, and so\n\n1052\n01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:09.320\nthey collected some of these things and\nhad dissected it in Poland.\n\n1053\n01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.738\nAnd when the war started,\nthe Polish scientists and\n\n1054\n01:01:12.738 --> 01:01:18.021\ncode breakers that worked on this, just\nshuffled all this stuff off to England,\n\n1055\n01:01:18.021 --> 01:01:22.149\nand essentially went their ways\nto escape the Nazis coming in.\n\n1056\n01:01:22.149 --> 01:01:26.363\nThe British actually went ahead and\ntook it to the next level and\n\n1057\n01:01:26.363 --> 01:01:29.625\nstarted reverse engineering and\nbreaking it and\n\n1058\n01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:33.841\ngetting to the point where they\ncould read messages with this,\n\n1059\n01:01:33.841 --> 01:01:38.410\nwith regularity, and that was\na huge challenge, but they did it.\n\n1060\n01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:44.380\nThey created these machines called the,\nI think the name was the Bomb.\n\n1061\n01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.640\nIf you've seen the movie\nThe Imitation Game,\n\n1062\n01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.885\nwhich is based on in part on this story.\n\n1063\n01:01:50.885 --> 01:01:55.335\nThis story frames\nthe story of Alan Turing.\n\n1064\n01:01:55.335 --> 01:01:56.835\nThat's what they were working on.\n\n1065\n01:01:56.835 --> 01:02:01.970\nAlan Turing did work on code breaking for\nthis.\n\n1066\n01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:05.850\nAnd so,\nit was significant when they broke it.\n\n1067\n01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:07.290\nOnce they broke it,\n\n1068\n01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:12.894\nthey could track movements of\nGerman military all over the place.\n\n1069\n01:02:12.894 --> 01:02:15.660\n>> And we didn't let them know that we had\nbroke it, so they continued to use it,\n\n1070\n01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:19.240\nthinking the messages were secret,\nand we were able to read them.\n\n1071\n01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.060\n>> Yeah,\nthey were able to read every message,\n\n1072\n01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.440\nessentially every message\nthat was getting passed.\n\n1073\n01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.530\nIt was just, they could get anything\nthat was going on in the field, and\n\n1074\n01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:33.920\nthe Wehrmacht use this,\nthe German land forces, and\n\n1075\n01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.520\nthe Kriegsmarine,\nthe German Navy had a version of this too.\n\n1076\n01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:42.130\nAnd so, you were able to get U-boat\nmovements off of this as well.\n\n1077\n01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:47.426\nSo it definitely played a huge role,\nand you just mentioned Mike,\n\n1078\n01:02:47.426 --> 01:02:53.692\nabout the allies not what the Germans\ndidn't know or let the Axis powers know.\n\n1079\n01:02:53.692 --> 01:02:57.380\nThat's also the other side of this thing,\nit shows somehow, or\n\n1080\n01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:01.520\nsometimes there's tough\ndecisions to be made in war.\n\n1081\n01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.260\nAnd as anybody knows,\nwhether you've been to one or\n\n1082\n01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:11.040\nnot, the Enigma was actually\ninvolved in one of those things\n\n1083\n01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.590\nwhere they actually decoded messages\nof a major German air attack\n\n1084\n01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:21.610\nthat was done in retaliation for\none that the Allies had done on Germany.\n\n1085\n01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:26.010\nAnd it was going towards the city\nof Coventry, and they had a choice.\n\n1086\n01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:28.140\nThey decoded the message and\nknew this was coming.\n\n1087\n01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.590\nAnd so they told Churchill.\n\n1088\n01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:35.170\nThey talked to him and said, well,\nwe basically got two choices here.\n\n1089\n01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:40.298\nWe can evacuate the city and\nsave all these thousands of lives,\n\n1090\n01:03:40.298 --> 01:03:42.537\nor we don't say anything.\n\n1091\n01:03:42.537 --> 01:03:43.744\nWhat do you wanna do?\n\n1092\n01:03:43.744 --> 01:03:49.980\nAnd you would think hey,\nwe gotta save the people in here.\n\n1093\n01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:53.460\nNo, Churchill said they're just\ngonna have to be left to their fate.\n\n1094\n01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:57.470\nBecause if he had moved people out\nof there Germans now know, and\n\n1095\n01:03:57.470 --> 01:04:01.030\nall of a sudden, they're going to rekey\nthings, and now all that code breaking and\n\n1096\n01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:04.920\nintel, the loss of it means you're gonna\nhave to redevelop those things, and\n\n1097\n01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.780\nthat could lengthen the war.\n\n1098\n01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:10.670\nCoventry was actually,\nit was bombed to the ground.\n\n1099\n01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:14.110\nThere was a lot of lives lost there.\n\n1100\n01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:17.860\nAnd a lot of people that became\nrefugees and everything because of it.\n\n1101\n01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:22.474\nIn fact, the Germans used a term\nafter that called coventry.\n\n1102\n01:04:22.474 --> 01:04:25.128\nIf they were going to level a city and\njust decimate it,\n\n1103\n01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:26.467\nthey used that term after.\n\n1104\n01:04:26.467 --> 01:04:28.230\nThey said they were going\nto coventrate a city,\n\n1105\n01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:29.962\nthat's what they meant\nthey were going to do.\n\n1106\n01:04:29.962 --> 01:04:31.508\nSo it was fascinating.\n\n1107\n01:04:31.508 --> 01:04:35.629\nThey just devastated what was there, but\n\n1108\n01:04:35.629 --> 01:04:40.350\nit was a tough decision\nto be made nonetheless.\n\n1109\n01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:47.340\nAt the end of it, the ultra code\nbreaking effort that the British had,\n\n1110\n01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:49.530\nthey believed it shortened the war.\n\n1111\n01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:52.760\nChurchill said he believed that\nit actually shortened the war\n\n1112\n01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.040\nby at least two years.\n\n1113\n01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:54.820\n>> Wow.\n>> So,\n\n1114\n01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:59.270\nthat's just something to\nkinda throw into that.\n\n1115\n01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:03.920\n>> And then you mentioned another\none called the Purple Machine.\n\n1116\n01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.599\n>> Phillip's already kind\nof doing his studying here.\n\n1117\n01:05:06.599 --> 01:05:10.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, there is the Purple Machine.\n\n1118\n01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.790\nThe Purple Machine,\nit's tougher to get pictures of this,\n\n1119\n01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:17.230\nto get real good pictures, or\nsee any working samples of this.\n\n1120\n01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:18.590\nThere's a reason why.\n\n1121\n01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:25.660\nIt essentially is a Japanese knock-off so\nto speak, or copy of Enigma.\n\n1122\n01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.820\nBecause Japanese were allied with Germany,\nso\n\n1123\n01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:33.360\none of the things that they got as\npart of that as part of that exchange.\n\n1124\n01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.630\nAnd they create a saying called\nthe Purple Machine which was very close.\n\n1125\n01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:38.840\nThis is a Wikipedia article on it.\n\n1126\n01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.590\nAnd this is just a piece of one.\n\n1127\n01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:47.200\nA lot of these things were destroyed\nduring the course of or after the war.\n\n1128\n01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.390\nThese were used for,\nin some cases, diplomatic stuff,\n\n1129\n01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:54.546\nand there was some used for\nmilitary purposes.\n\n1130\n01:05:54.546 --> 01:05:58.870\nThis one, the US was able to break this.\n\n1131\n01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:05.350\nThe interesting thing about this is if\nyou look on the attack on Pearl Harbor,\n\n1132\n01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:11.100\nthe Japanese of course did that, pretty\nmuch everyone knows after Pearl Harbor,\n\n1133\n01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:15.490\nwe know what happened, we know the story.\n\n1134\n01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:19.060\nBut one of the things that you may not be\naware of is that when that bombing was\n\n1135\n01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:24.820\ngoing on, the actual code breaking that\nhelped, could do the code breaking unit,\n\n1136\n01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:29.590\nthat helped break a lot of the things that\nmessages of the Japanese were sending\n\n1137\n01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:33.420\nduring the war and allowed us to\nhave a big strategic advantage.\n\n1138\n01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.210\nIt was only a short\ndistance from Pearl Harbor.\n\n1139\n01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:38.650\nIt was on that base and\nthe Japanese missed it.\n\n1140\n01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:42.020\nThere were bombs dropped around it, but\nit was just an innocuous looking facility.\n\n1141\n01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:43.590\nThey missed it.\n\n1142\n01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:47.490\nIf they had hit that, they could have\nmade, they could have been argued that\n\n1143\n01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:50.090\nthey could have made a much\nbigger difference on the war.\n\n1144\n01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:53.190\nMaybe the outcome would have been the\nsame, but they could have done something.\n\n1145\n01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:56.100\nWell, it definitely would\nhave had an impact.\n\n1146\n01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:01.014\nBut the result was that we were actually\nable to break the codes used by\n\n1147\n01:07:01.014 --> 01:07:05.771\nthe Purple Machine, able to track\nmovements and stuff like that.\n\n1148\n01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:10.283\nAnd in fact, one of the most\ninteresting roles of breaking\n\n1149\n01:07:10.283 --> 01:07:14.427\nthe Purple Machine came down\nto the Battle of Midway,\n\n1150\n01:07:14.427 --> 01:07:19.399\nbecause in the Battle of Midway,\nwhat happened is that the US had\n\n1151\n01:07:19.399 --> 01:07:24.032\nalready broken and\nthe Pacific had broken these codes.\n\n1152\n01:07:24.032 --> 01:07:28.800\nWe were able to read Japanese traffic,\nbut the one thing that was missing in\n\n1153\n01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:34.037\nthe case of Midway is that they didn't\nknow where the Japanese were gonna strike.\n\n1154\n01:07:34.037 --> 01:07:37.371\nThey knew that there was\nan imminent attack that was gonna\n\n1155\n01:07:37.371 --> 01:07:41.060\nhappen at one of two places\nthey narrowed it down to.\n\n1156\n01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:45.430\nIt was either gonna be Midway,\nor it was gonna be a much\n\n1157\n01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:49.950\nheavier attack up in Alaska some place,\nin the Aleutians and that area.\n\n1158\n01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:52.160\nAnd the Japanese did have\na presence there, but\n\n1159\n01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:58.130\nnot nearly what was being suspected here,\nand so you've gotta position your forces.\n\n1160\n01:07:58.130 --> 01:07:59.260\nYou have limited forces.\n\n1161\n01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.150\nSo if you're the admirals in\nthe Pacific fleet at that time,\n\n1162\n01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:04.680\nyou've gotta make a choice.\n\n1163\n01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.970\nSo what they did is they said,\nwe know it's one of these two places, and\n\n1164\n01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:11.390\nwe gotta figure out which one, so\n\n1165\n01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:16.950\nwhat they did is they got a code that\nthey knew the Japanese broke already,\n\n1166\n01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:19.940\nthey were well aware Japanese had\nbroken one of these US codes.\n\n1167\n01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.620\nWhat they did is they transmitted\nout a message on that for\n\n1168\n01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:26.910\nMidway saying, oh,\nwe have a low water situation at Midway.\n\n1169\n01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:30.310\nAnd so the Japanese intercepted that\nmessage and retransmitted it to\n\n1170\n01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:34.300\ntheir fleet, saying there's low water, and\nthey used the code word for their target.\n\n1171\n01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.870\nAnd so, they knew, yeah,\nit's Midway they are going to strike out,\n\n1172\n01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:42.499\nbecause they did the modern day equivalent\nof reTweeting a message, right.\n\n1173\n01:08:42.499 --> 01:08:44.740\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> So they went ahead and\n\n1174\n01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:49.880\nsent that back out, and so\nthe US positioned just a whole ton of\n\n1175\n01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:55.150\nforces around Midway and was ready for the\nJapanese fleet and actually sunk a couple.\n\n1176\n01:08:55.150 --> 01:08:55.960\nI think it was one or\n\n1177\n01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.010\ntwo of their carriers that\nwere involved in Pearl Harbor.\n\n1178\n01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:05.290\nAnd then they did, actually, the whole\ncourse of the war changed at that point.\n\n1179\n01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:12.660\nOnce Midway was won decisively by the US,\nand the Japanese took a beating,\n\n1180\n01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:16.690\nit was all just US momentum\ngaining all the way into the war.\n\n1181\n01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:20.590\nSo it was just a fascinating,\nthat played such a tremendous role there.\n\n1182\n01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:24.370\nYeah, there's no doubting,\nI've had some Navy guys that say oh, well,\n\n1183\n01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:25.860\nthe Navy had something to say about it.\n\n1184\n01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:27.050\nNot saying they didn't.\n\n1185\n01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:30.980\nI'm just saying that this allowed you\nto get more of a strategic advantage\n\n1186\n01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:33.880\nby having this advanced intel.\n\n1187\n01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.850\nIt's incredibly fascinating,\nthe way they did it.\n\n1188\n01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:40.990\nAnd to think about the fact\nthey did codebreaking with not\n\n1189\n01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:45.670\ncomputers, mind you,\nlike slide rules and stuff like that.\n\n1190\n01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:52.012\nSome of you, I don't know,\nI can't see anybody on here, but you and\n\n1191\n01:09:52.012 --> 01:09:53.997\nI know what slide rules are.\n\n1192\n01:09:53.997 --> 01:09:57.530\nWe've probably got a number of people out\nhere who know what a slide rule is, but\n\n1193\n01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:01.014\nthere's chances there's people that\nare young enough in here that are like,\n\n1194\n01:10:01.014 --> 01:10:02.630\nslide rule, what the hell is that?\n\n1195\n01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:06.160\nYeah, go look it up.\n\n1196\n01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.210\nEven when people like us were in school,\n\n1197\n01:10:08.210 --> 01:10:10.970\nit was kind of like, you know a lot of\nus in here was like, who's using that?\n\n1198\n01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:11.920\nWe've got calculators now.\n\n1199\n01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.560\n>> That's right.\n>> But\n\n1200\n01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.540\nyou think about these guys\nwere using slide rules and\n\n1201\n01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:21.670\njust doing stuff on paper and all that and\nwere making this tremendous impact.\n\n1202\n01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:23.252\nIt just shows you how powerful,\n\n1203\n01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:26.718\nthe most powerful code breaking\ndevice you have is between your ears.\n\n1204\n01:10:26.718 --> 01:10:27.716\n>> Yeah.\n\n1205\n01:10:27.716 --> 01:10:31.930\n>> It's just amazingly\ninteresting story there.\n\n1206\n01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:33.590\n>> All right, well I tell you what.\n\n1207\n01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:35.640\nLadies and gentleman,\nlooking at the clock, it's about time for\n\n1208\n01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.620\nus to take one of our breaks.\n\n1209\n01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:37.518\nSo we will step away.\n\n1210\n01:10:37.518 --> 01:10:41.570\nWhen we come back, we're gonna continue\non with our history of cryptography.\n\n1211\n01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:44.226\nSo, stay tuned, and we'll be right back.\n\n1212\n01:10:44.226 --> 01:10:49.424\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back,\n\n1213\n01:10:49.424 --> 01:10:53.144\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n1214\n01:10:53.144 --> 01:10:56.720\nSo Sean, we were talking about\nthe history of cryptography,\n\n1215\n01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:01.070\nwe took it from ancient times all the way\nup into World War I and World War II.\n\n1216\n01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:04.010\nAnd I know there's one more thing I\nthink you wanted to mention there when\n\n1217\n01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.390\nit came to World War II?\n\n1218\n01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:12.020\n>> Yes, there's a few other things, but\njust to kind of throw something in there.\n\n1219\n01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:15.770\nI didn't mention any really too\nmuch aside from code breaking,\n\n1220\n01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:18.990\nwhat the US had been doing at this time.\n\n1221\n01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:22.870\nBut with their own cryptographic systems,\nbut\n\n1222\n01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:26.040\nthey had a few, the US had a few in play.\n\n1223\n01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.740\nI mean some of them, you can see stuff\nlike, I've got it up on my screen here.\n\n1224\n01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.660\nYou can get stuff like\nthis off of eBay now.\n\n1225\n01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:37.120\nThis was a field unit for\nthe Signal Corps for the Army.\n\n1226\n01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:40.210\nI mean,\nthis is just one of our cryptographic\n\n1227\n01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:46.040\ndevices that were available and you can\nsee that's not a bad price if you want\n\n1228\n01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:51.390\na piece of militaria,\nif you're into having that sort of thing.\n\n1229\n01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:52.400\nBut you can see,\n\n1230\n01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:57.180\nit's just something that you would go\nthrough and adjust the settings on it.\n\n1231\n01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.580\nAnd then just send your message out,\ntap it out or whatever.\n\n1232\n01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:07.730\nAnd it would give you a coded message\nthat you could then go out and send.\n\n1233\n01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:10.590\nThis type of device is,\ninteresting enough,\n\n1234\n01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:15.420\ndesigned to be a short term\ncryptographic mechanism.\n\n1235\n01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:19.699\nIt's really not that strong, and you might\nwonder why they would deploy something\n\n1236\n01:12:19.699 --> 01:12:21.788\ninto the field that's not that strong.\n\n1237\n01:12:21.788 --> 01:12:25.171\nWell, this is the type of thing that\nyour soldier would carry in the field.\n\n1238\n01:12:25.171 --> 01:12:28.895\nYou'd have enlisted or whatever.\n\n1239\n01:12:28.895 --> 01:12:32.615\nCarrying something like this,\nand what would happen is that,\n\n1240\n01:12:32.615 --> 01:12:37.387\nif they need to transmit messages to the\ndifferent positions on what the enemy was\n\n1241\n01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:42.229\ndoing, they would just tell this person,\nthis person would tap out the message,\n\n1242\n01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:45.480\nand it could get sent\nout to these other guys.\n\n1243\n01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:49.090\nIf you're in Europe, let's say,\nand you're fighting the Germans,\n\n1244\n01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:52.890\nand you know they can break this,\nokay fine, they can break it,\n\n1245\n01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:57.690\nbut it's gonna take them maybe two,\nthree, four hours to do it.\n\n1246\n01:12:57.690 --> 01:13:00.370\nIf you're engaged in an active\nbattle at that point,\n\n1247\n01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:03.210\nby the time they've broken it,\nsituation's already changed.\n\n1248\n01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:05.540\nSo, they didn't care\nthe US just wanted it for\n\n1249\n01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:09.460\nthe field unit they wanted something that\nwas nice and simple, and easy to use.\n\n1250\n01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:12.890\nI could just tap that, tap, send message\nout, and if certificate gets broken, fine.\n\n1251\n01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:13.700\nI've already moved on.\n\n1252\n01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.040\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n1253\n01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.660\nThere are more secure devices than\nthis that were of course bigger, but\n\n1254\n01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:23.670\nthis would be something that somebody\nin the field could carry right on them.\n\n1255\n01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:25.230\nOnly designated people though.\n\n1256\n01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:27.810\n>> And that's something we're going\nto talk about in later episodes, but\n\n1257\n01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:31.070\nreally when it comes down to it\n>> If the strong,\n\n1258\n01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:32.440\nweak encryption what have you.\n\n1259\n01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.160\nAs long as it's strong enough for\nit to last for\n\n1260\n01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:39.360\nhowever long I need to keep that secret,\nthat's important.\n\n1261\n01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.370\nOnce I don't need to keep that\nsecret if you break it down,\n\n1262\n01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:44.160\nwho cares at that point.\n\n1263\n01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.670\nSo it just needs to be strong enough for\n\n1264\n01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:49.392\nhowever long you need to\nkeep that information safe.\n\n1265\n01:13:49.392 --> 01:13:51.500\nAll right, so in modern times,\n\n1266\n01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:56.138\nwe still obviously have cryptography\nused in just about everything we do.\n\n1267\n01:13:56.138 --> 01:13:58.770\nIn fact,\nI'd be willing to say that most of us\n\n1268\n01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:03.520\nhave touched cryptography in one way or\nform today in our normal course of action.\n\n1269\n01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:08.980\nYeah, cryptography is something that is\nliterally all over the place, now a days.\n\n1270\n01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:14.990\nWith all the interconnected systems,\ninformation that's getting sent back and\n\n1271\n01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:19.025\nforth, email, internet, VPN's, e-commerce.\n\n1272\n01:14:19.025 --> 01:14:20.950\nE-commerce is a really good one.\n\n1273\n01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:25.182\nWhat would you do to have an e-commerce\nsystem if I took photography and\n\n1274\n01:14:25.182 --> 01:14:28.240\nripped it out of the picture\nsaid now do you want it.\n\n1275\n01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.380\nKeep it secure.\n\n1276\n01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:31.498\nI've just ruined your whole day.\n\n1277\n01:14:31.498 --> 01:14:34.440\n>> If you told me my credit card\nwas going to go online without any\n\n1278\n01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:35.570\nform of encryption.\n\n1279\n01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:37.460\nI wouldn't be doing much shopping.\n\n1280\n01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:40.700\n>> No. [LAUGH] >> And most of you,\nhow many bought something today online?\n\n1281\n01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:43.420\nOr did their banking online and\npaid some bills?\n\n1282\n01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.258\nOr heck, logging into this show.\n\n1283\n01:14:45.258 --> 01:14:49.620\nIf you logged into our website,\nwe use a secure process for that.\n\n1284\n01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:52.370\nSo you've interacted\nwith some cryptography.\n\n1285\n01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:56.100\n>> Yeah, and just because the thing\nthat changed over the last\n\n1286\n01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:59.171\nfew years has been that\nit becomes transparent.\n\n1287\n01:14:59.171 --> 01:15:01.295\nYou don't have to think about it.\n\n1288\n01:15:01.295 --> 01:15:05.540\nYou do e-commerce, you don't have to think\nabout key exchange and algorithm and sort.\n\n1289\n01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:07.230\nThe system does that.\n\n1290\n01:15:07.230 --> 01:15:09.780\nThat's just the way it works.\n\n1291\n01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:11.190\nSo you get to use it.\n\n1292\n01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:15.040\nYou could use full drive\nencryption easy to do\n\n1293\n01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.410\nbecause that's completely transparent.\n\n1294\n01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:20.260\nSo that's the really cool thing,\nall these details,\n\n1295\n01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:24.160\nthe mathematics all that, are just so\nfar out of the picture for you.\n\n1296\n01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.220\nThat and you don't have to worry about it,\nthat just keep doing what you're doing and\n\n1297\n01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:30.290\ncryptography does its job.\n\n1298\n01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:35.770\nAnd so it's been a much different world,\neven though we're using it more.\n\n1299\n01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:38.000\nIt's easier to use.\n\n1300\n01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.670\nAnd just to kind of point out, because of\ncomputers being brought into the picture,\n\n1301\n01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:48.430\nwe've seen a lot of advances\nover the past past few years,\n\n1302\n01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:52.240\nwell, more than the past few years,\nprobably like the past 40 years,\n\n1303\n01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.480\nwe've seen some substantial improvements.\n\n1304\n01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.290\nWe've seen stuff like hashing\nappear because of technology.\n\n1305\n01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:03.490\nLater on, we saw asymmetric,\nor public-key cryptography.\n\n1306\n01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:07.580\nThat was actually written\nabout in the late 60s,\n\n1307\n01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:13.580\nearly 70s it was written about in\npapers and the theory came out.\n\n1308\n01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:17.270\nIt was computers that made that possible\nwith all the complex number crunching\n\n1309\n01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.944\nabilities they had.\n\n1310\n01:16:19.705 --> 01:16:23.695\nSo that existed because of that, so\nthere's been some dramatic changes.\n\n1311\n01:16:23.695 --> 01:16:28.815\nAnd then cryptography shows up in\nweird places like in puzzle books and\n\n1312\n01:16:28.815 --> 01:16:29.825\ndecorations.\n\n1313\n01:16:29.825 --> 01:16:33.727\nThere's manuscripts you can\nsee that are out there.\n\n1314\n01:16:33.727 --> 01:16:37.157\nI know of one manuscript that's\ngot its own secret language that\n\n1315\n01:16:37.157 --> 01:16:38.347\nno one's been able to decrypt.\n\n1316\n01:16:38.347 --> 01:16:39.727\nIt's a big mystery what it is.\n\n1317\n01:16:39.727 --> 01:16:41.547\nThey know the book says something.\n\n1318\n01:16:41.547 --> 01:16:44.287\nIt has all these ornately\ndone characters and\n\n1319\n01:16:44.287 --> 01:16:46.880\ndrawings in it and\nno one knows what it says.\n\n1320\n01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:47.860\n>> Really?\n>> It's a, yeah,\n\n1321\n01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:51.123\na lot of people have worked on it,\na lot of brain power, and\n\n1322\n01:16:51.123 --> 01:16:53.603\nthey don't know what that, what it means.\n\n1323\n01:16:53.603 --> 01:16:55.640\n>> I sense a challenge, let's get on it.\n\n1324\n01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.850\n>> Yeah, you guys can start working on it.\n\n1325\n01:16:57.850 --> 01:17:01.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then you get samples like this.\n\n1326\n01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:04.550\nThis is something that you,\nthat I've got on my screen.\n\n1327\n01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:10.830\nThis is a sample of another place\nwhere cryptography appears.\n\n1328\n01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:13.320\nI don't know,\nsome of you may have seen this.\n\n1329\n01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.820\nIn fact, I think probably a lot\nof you may have seen this.\n\n1330\n01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:19.060\nIn fact, some of you may be looking at it\nwithout looking at the URL or anything.\n\n1331\n01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:23.550\nYou might look at it and say I've seen\nit before but I can't tell you where.\n\n1332\n01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:25.480\nIt's like at the back\nof my mind someplace.\n\n1333\n01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.710\n>> Is it Klingon?\n\n1334\n01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:30.790\n>> That's the Indiana Jones'\nride at Disneyland.\n\n1335\n01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:31.880\n>> That's all over the place there.\n\n1336\n01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.590\nThat's an actual language.\n\n1337\n01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:39.040\nYou can actually get, if you go to well,\n\n1338\n01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.360\nthey used to hand these things out\nat Disneyland, they don't anymore.\n\n1339\n01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:46.580\nThey used to hand these out when\nthe Indiana Jones ride opened up.\n\n1340\n01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:49.590\nSo when you're standing in line, you could\nactually decode the message and it says,\n\n1341\n01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:53.450\nwarning, don't look into the eyes\nof the idol or something like that.\n\n1342\n01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:57.420\nIt would have these little things that\nplayed into the story of the ride but\n\n1343\n01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:58.000\nthey're there.\n\n1344\n01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.005\nThey're there,\n\n1345\n01:17:59.005 --> 01:18:03.296\nI mean they used it as a decoration in a\nway to add a little bit of mystery to it.\n\n1346\n01:18:03.296 --> 01:18:05.570\nSo you never know what's gonna show up.\n\n1347\n01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:06.650\nYeah, it's a cookbook.\n\n1348\n01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:10.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nice one.\n\n1349\n01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.720\nThat's just one thing.\n\n1350\n01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.330\n>> Right.\n>> I remember seeing the Caesar cypher on\n\n1351\n01:18:16.330 --> 01:18:17.830\nthe back of cereal boxes.\n\n1352\n01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:20.870\nThat's why that one sticks with me.\n\n1353\n01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:23.210\nBut then like you said,\nthere's the rings, and other things.\n\n1354\n01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:26.580\nAnd there's even video games\nthat have crypto puzzles in\n\n1355\n01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.600\nthem that you have to solve\nto complete the game.\n\n1356\n01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:32.040\nSo it's all over the place,\nnot just technology.\n\n1357\n01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.230\nSome people do this just for fun.\n\n1358\n01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:36.800\n>> Like guys like you.\n\n1359\n01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.462\n>> Yeah,\nguys like me that have no life apparently.\n\n1360\n01:18:40.462 --> 01:18:44.760\n>> All right, so Sean,\ngreat look at the history of cryptography.\n\n1361\n01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.910\nAgain, we said we really\ngot to see where it comes\n\n1362\n01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:51.910\nfrom in order to understand where\nit is now, and where it's going.\n\n1363\n01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:55.190\nAnd some of those things we looked at\nare gonna make understanding some of these\n\n1364\n01:18:55.190 --> 01:18:59.480\nlater topics a whole lot easier\nwhen we talk about the substitution\n\n1365\n01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:02.290\nversus transpose and things like that.\n\n1366\n01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:04.530\nIt's great information, good history.\n\n1367\n01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:08.740\nAlso, it's invaluable in helping us\nprepare for the rest of these shows.\n\n1368\n01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:10.590\nLet's take a look at where are we headed.\n\n1369\n01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:12.060\nWhat do you see next.\n\n1370\n01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:13.490\nIt's not gonna stop, right?\n\n1371\n01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:17.340\nIt's been evolving since the Egyptian\ntimes coming through now.\n\n1372\n01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.680\nAnd it's not gonna stop now\njust cuz we've done this show.\n\n1373\n01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.650\nIt's gonna continue to go on, right?\n\n1374\n01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:24.880\n>> Yeah this is something\nthat's gonna keep improving,\n\n1375\n01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:28.720\nkeep improving, keep improving, and\nthere's numerous reasons for that.\n\n1376\n01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.680\nThe biggest driver behind\nthat is technology.\n\n1377\n01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:35.740\nTechnology has rendered\na lot of these old systems\n\n1378\n01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:40.030\njust obsolete when their on their own.\n\n1379\n01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:41.380\n>> Well we've got some great examples.\n\n1380\n01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:44.630\nI mean in the chat room just during\nthis episode we've thrown up\n\n1381\n01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:47.720\nlinks that have simulators for\nthe enigma machine.\n\n1382\n01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:51.890\nFor and for the Caesar Cypher and\nall of these, so\n\n1383\n01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:55.980\nobviously, none of those are good anymore\nbecause I can open up my browser,\n\n1384\n01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.450\nplug in my cypher text and\nget the original text back out.\n\n1385\n01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:03.898\nShowing you what technology has done to\nthese older algorithms or these older\n\n1386\n01:20:03.898 --> 01:20:08.365\ncryptography methods so it really is\ndriving us to come up with more powerful,\n\n1387\n01:20:08.365 --> 01:20:11.228\nmore complex,\nmeans of hiding our information.\n\n1388\n01:20:11.228 --> 01:20:15.970\n>> Yes that's where it's gonna come\ndown to is that, yes, technology,\n\n1389\n01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:20.872\nbecause it's become stronger,\nyeah you have to find ways to improve it,\n\n1390\n01:20:20.872 --> 01:20:23.899\nso technology can't\nhave such an easy time.\n\n1391\n01:20:23.899 --> 01:20:25.283\nYou don't have access to all that ease.\n\n1392\n01:20:25.283 --> 01:20:27.773\nSo the more computing power you have,\nYou know,\n\n1393\n01:20:27.773 --> 01:20:30.527\nI can put it just out of reach\nof your computing power.\n\n1394\n01:20:30.527 --> 01:20:37.500\nBasically every cryptographic system, with\na couple notable examples, is breakable.\n\n1395\n01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.840\nIt's just a question of how\nlong it takes to break it.\n\n1396\n01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:44.210\nAnd so by the time you break some of\nthese things they're just not useful.\n\n1397\n01:20:44.210 --> 01:20:48.920\nIn fact, we have a case in point,\nor case as an example\n\n1398\n01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:52.360\nwith one of the things we've already\ntalked about which was Enigma.\n\n1399\n01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:59.280\nEnigma was broken during the war\nthrough finding defects and\n\n1400\n01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:03.700\nflaws and little things in it and having\nsome inside knowledge of the system.\n\n1401\n01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:09.410\nIf they had tried to brute force that\njust by using raw computing power.\n\n1402\n01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:13.070\nIt would've taken a lot longer but\nit would've been broken.\n\n1403\n01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:17.930\nAnd a really good example of that\nis one of the five rotor machines,\n\n1404\n01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:19.100\nthat was used during the war,\n\n1405\n01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:22.480\nthey still had some messages that\nhad not been broken, with it.\n\n1406\n01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.390\nThey were just things that were out there.\n\n1407\n01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:29.660\nActually they had been broken,\n\n1408\n01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:33.260\nbut it was just a case of well,\nwe hadn't knew the tricks for there.\n\n1409\n01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:34.610\nWhat if we tried to brute force it?\n\n1410\n01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:35.850\nWhat would have taken?\n\n1411\n01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:40.370\nIt wasn't til the early\nvery early 2000's that\n\n1412\n01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:43.990\nthey were able to use a super\ncomputer to break what the Enigma\n\n1413\n01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:46.738\nwas spitting out just\nthrough a brute force attack.\n\n1414\n01:21:46.738 --> 01:21:47.530\n>> Wow.\n>> So\n\n1415\n01:21:47.530 --> 01:21:52.630\nthat speaks to the fact that technology's\ngonna help you with this, but\n\n1416\n01:21:52.630 --> 01:21:57.950\na well designed system, well designed\nalgorithm, can go a long way.\n\n1417\n01:21:57.950 --> 01:22:02.210\nTechnology and cryptography, like I was\nsaying in the intro to it, technology and\n\n1418\n01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.005\ncryptography, they go\ntogether a lot nowadays.\n\n1419\n01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:11.500\nBut you could sit through this whole\nthing and not know really anything about\n\n1420\n01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:15.240\ntechnology if you wanted, and\nthen understand cryptography.\n\n1421\n01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.509\nThey're not something\nthat requires one another\n\n1422\n01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:23.150\nIt's just a really kinda fascinating,\ninteresting thing to it.\n\n1423\n01:22:23.150 --> 01:22:28.850\nBut yeah, the technology is a huge\ndriver as are other demands.\n\n1424\n01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:31.260\nSince things are changing so rapidly.\n\n1425\n01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:37.250\nYou've got things like distributed\ncomputing that changed it,\n\n1426\n01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:39.630\nthe cloud, all these things.\n\n1427\n01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:41.140\nThe pool of resources and\n\n1428\n01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:46.740\ndevelop ever better technology is really\ngonna push this further and further out.\n\n1429\n01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:51.260\nAnd then there's gonna be a lot of\nguys that are on the other side\n\n1430\n01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:53.990\ntrying to stop it, put it further and\nfurther out of reach.\n\n1431\n01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.750\n>> Yeah.\n\n1432\n01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:58.510\nSo really, it's things like\nbetter algorithms, stronger,\n\n1433\n01:22:58.510 --> 01:23:02.880\njust more complex mathematical\nalgorithms that can help make it.\n\n1434\n01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.960\nThis is what we see coming\ndown the road in the future,\n\n1435\n01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.670\nis they've got to get stronger\nbecause of the computing power.\n\n1436\n01:23:08.670 --> 01:23:11.600\nWhat I've got in this\nlaptop might be comparable\n\n1437\n01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.630\nto what they used to track some of\nthose codes way back in the day.\n\n1438\n01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:18.740\nAnd then keys, I know we haven't really\ngotten into our terminology yet,\n\n1439\n01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:21.540\nbut longer keys will\ncome into play as well.\n\n1440\n01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:24.490\n>> Yeah, they'll start to bring in\nincreasingly longer keys to make it\n\n1441\n01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:29.400\ntougher to defeat as one of the ways\nto make it tougher to defeat a system.\n\n1442\n01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:33.890\nSo, you put that with a better algorithm,\na better well designed algorithm.\n\n1443\n01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:35.690\nThat will go a long,\n\n1444\n01:23:35.690 --> 01:23:41.140\nlong way towards making your stuff\nstay secure just that much longer.\n\n1445\n01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:44.440\nAnd as you were mentioning\nabout the computing power,\n\n1446\n01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.370\nwe have a great example in here is.\n\n1447\n01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:52.760\nThe symmetric algorithms,\nDES and Triple DES.\n\n1448\n01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:57.510\nDez was developed in the 70s and\nwas considered to be secure\n\n1449\n01:23:57.510 --> 01:24:01.800\nuntil about the early 90s and\nthen they found ways to break it, so\n\n1450\n01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:06.250\nthey just kind of said well let's do some\ntweaks to it, came up with Triple DES.\n\n1451\n01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:10.580\nInterestingly enough, they did have a\nDouble DES but Just doubling the strength\n\n1452\n01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:15.300\nof DES didn't really offer\nany substantial benefits but\n\n1453\n01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:20.490\ntripling it there was a large\nexponential increase in strength so\n\n1454\n01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:22.965\nthat's why that's used\nBased on the old one.\n\n1455\n01:24:22.965 --> 01:24:27.585\nAnd so, that's the mathematics part.\n\n1456\n01:24:27.585 --> 01:24:28.875\nWe'll stay out of that.\n\n1457\n01:24:28.875 --> 01:24:33.605\nBut that was just one of the many cases\nwhere technology made a huge difference.\n\n1458\n01:24:33.605 --> 01:24:38.020\nIt obsoleted that DES algorithm\nwhich had been used for\n\n1459\n01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:42.290\na long time for more secure applications,\nit's out of there now.\n\n1460\n01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:48.020\nIf you use DES now, people that are in the\nknow are gonna say what's wrong with you?\n\n1461\n01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:48.730\nWhy are you using that?\n\n1462\n01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:50.950\nYou want to protect your mom's\ncookie recipe, go for it.\n\n1463\n01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:53.100\nThat's not for\nsomething that's financial or\n\n1464\n01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:54.335\nanything else you wanna protect with that.\n\n1465\n01:24:54.335 --> 01:24:55.190\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1466\n01:24:55.190 --> 01:25:00.420\nAnd then we've got, in the near future or\nsometime in the future, you might take\n\n1467\n01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:05.160\nit into the world of quantum mechanics,\nand do some quantum cryptography.\n\n1468\n01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:09.910\n>> Yes, that's where things are going is,\nyou may have already heard about quantum\n\n1469\n01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:15.320\ncomputing, you know quantum computing is\nbased on the technology and knowledge of\n\n1470\n01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:21.050\nquantum mechanics,\nwhich is sub atomic stuff.\n\n1471\n01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:27.495\nYou're talking about states of particles\nand things like Shrodenger's cat,\n\n1472\n01:25:27.495 --> 01:25:32.977\nsuper positions of different particles\nof how you observe stuff and\n\n1473\n01:25:32.977 --> 01:25:39.444\nthen even these weird things like quantum\nentanglement and quantum cohesion.\n\n1474\n01:25:39.444 --> 01:25:43.104\nIt's really just some off\nthe wall stuff that we're doing,\n\n1475\n01:25:43.104 --> 01:25:47.360\nthat we're going to be doing,\nthat we already are doing in that area.\n\n1476\n01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.740\nA lot of the ground work for\nthat has already been put in place.\n\n1477\n01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:55.860\nIt's just a question of applying it\nin such a way that it's workable\n\n1478\n01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:59.550\non an everyday basis effectively.\n\n1479\n01:25:59.550 --> 01:26:05.250\nSo it's a fascinating development\nwhen you get into it.\n\n1480\n01:26:05.250 --> 01:26:09.660\nAnd we're going to talk about that\nmore towards our final episodes,\n\n1481\n01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.530\nonce we've got some things underneath us.\n\n1482\n01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:14.150\nWe don't need to blow your mind now,\non these things, but\n\n1483\n01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:16.739\nthat's what's gonna-\n>> Give you some time to do some\n\n1484\n01:26:16.739 --> 01:26:19.730\nreading on quantum cryptography\nbefore we get to that.\n\n1485\n01:26:19.730 --> 01:26:23.202\n>> Yeah, I've got a set up,\nthe super collider and\n\n1486\n01:26:23.202 --> 01:26:25.660\nall that back here to\ndemonstrate accurately.\n\n1487\n01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:27.880\nIt's [LAUGH]-\n>> Just for a teaser,\n\n1488\n01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:32.698\nit's to the point now, where they can\nmake it with quantum cryptography,\n\n1489\n01:26:32.698 --> 01:26:35.920\nif you look at the encrypted\nstuff it can actually\n\n1490\n01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.470\nalter it in a way where they can tell\nthat you've actually looked at it.\n\n1491\n01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:41.010\nNot modified it,\njust even observed it in the first place.\n\n1492\n01:26:41.010 --> 01:26:43.780\nSo that's some pretty interesting stuff.\n\n1493\n01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:47.120\nAnd like I say we'll get into that\ntowards the end of the week so.\n\n1494\n01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.600\n>> Yeah it's, that, what you just said,\nyeah, that's a key part of it.\n\n1495\n01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.760\n>> Yeah.\nSomebody could look at your data,\n\n1496\n01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.610\nand all of a sudden we can\ntell that you've observed it.\n\n1497\n01:26:56.610 --> 01:26:59.430\nAnd hashing, like I say we'll\nbreak it down a lot more as we go.\n\n1498\n01:26:59.430 --> 01:27:01.560\nWe're going to stick\nwith the high level here.\n\n1499\n01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.125\nBut stay tuned for some of that,\nit's fascinating stuff.\n\n1500\n01:27:04.125 --> 01:27:06.791\n>> I think about this thing they did and\nwhen you said that,\n\n1501\n01:27:06.791 --> 01:27:08.454\nI think about this thing they did.\n\n1502\n01:27:08.454 --> 01:27:13.680\nYou can tell the physics nerds really\nquickly when I say something like this.\n\n1503\n01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:17.670\nThey did it in that\ncartoon show Futurerama.\n\n1504\n01:27:17.670 --> 01:27:20.200\nThey have these little in jokes so\nthat are only for\n\n1505\n01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:23.370\ncertain people and there are communities\nto join, all these different levels.\n\n1506\n01:27:23.370 --> 01:27:27.220\nThere's this one that I saw in there and\nI just started just like laughing and\n\n1507\n01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:29.590\nmy friends are going,\nwhat's funny about that, I don't get it.\n\n1508\n01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:32.463\nIt was a physics joke talking\nabout this type of stuff.\n\n1509\n01:27:32.463 --> 01:27:37.788\nAnd the guys in there were running\na race in there, for whatever reason,\n\n1510\n01:27:37.788 --> 01:27:43.750\nthey were running a race, and their guy,\nthe heroes, I guess, of the series.\n\n1511\n01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:47.950\nTheir guy lost, and the professor in\nthere yells out to the people that were\n\n1512\n01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:52.200\nmeasuring the race and\ntaking pictures of what the finish was.\n\n1513\n01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:55.410\nHe yells out and goes,\nyou changed the outcome by measuring it.\n\n1514\n01:27:55.410 --> 01:27:56.740\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1515\n01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:58.220\n>> I just thought that was funny.\n\n1516\n01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:00.000\n>> I'm sure people are getting\nthat one [CROSSTALK]\n\n1517\n01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:00.799\n>> It's like oh yeah,\n\n1518\n01:28:00.799 --> 01:28:02.680\nonly a few people are gonna\nget that reference.\n\n1519\n01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.070\nBut it was pretty funny.\n\n1520\n01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:07.325\nIt's like,\nyou changed it by by measuring it.\n\n1521\n01:28:07.325 --> 01:28:10.820\nSo if you don't get that now,\nyou'll get it later on in the week.\n\n1522\n01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:13.480\nAnd then you'll feel\nlike a nerd just like me.\n\n1523\n01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.210\n>> There you go.\n\n1524\n01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:14.885\nSo.\n\n1525\n01:28:14.885 --> 01:28:15.599\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, Sean.\n\n1526\n01:28:15.599 --> 01:28:17.316\nWell, a lot of good\ninformation there again.\n\n1527\n01:28:17.316 --> 01:28:22.085\nWe really covered the gamut of the history\nof cryptography from the ancient\n\n1528\n01:28:22.085 --> 01:28:25.351\nEgyptians All the way up\nto quantum cryptography.\n\n1529\n01:28:25.351 --> 01:28:30.180\nSo, anything else you wanna leave with\nthem before we call it an episode?\n\n1530\n01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:35.300\n>> There's nothing really specific,\nbut there's a couple\n\n1531\n01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:39.330\nof things in the chatroom, at least one\nthing in the chatroom I'd point out\n\n1532\n01:28:39.330 --> 01:28:41.300\n>> Is it Philip brought this one, or\n\n1533\n01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:44.730\nI saw a few of them were chatting back and\nforth about this.\n\n1534\n01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:50.800\nDuring World War II, they had\nthe Windtalkers in the Pacific and\n\n1535\n01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:55.980\nthe Navajos were in the war and\n\n1536\n01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:59.070\nthey were used because their language,\nthe Japanese didn't know it.\n\n1537\n01:28:59.070 --> 01:29:03.420\nAnd so these guys basically had\na bodyguard and went around and\n\n1538\n01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:06.490\nthey exchanged messages back and\nforth with a radio.\n\n1539\n01:29:06.490 --> 01:29:10.660\nJapanese never figured it out,\nthey just absolutely never did.\n\n1540\n01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:13.570\nAnd it was just an instant thing.\n\n1541\n01:29:13.570 --> 01:29:18.680\nIt was a language that not documented, not\nwritten down and very very few talkers and\n\n1542\n01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:24.609\nnone of them were outside of the US so\nit really really went a long way.\n\n1543\n01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:29.790\nWas another,\nI know I've over used the word,\n\n1544\n01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:34.620\nanother interesting part in\nthe history of cryptography.\n\n1545\n01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.920\nActually I think that-\n>> That's really a code,\n\n1546\n01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:39.170\nlike we differentiated earlier between,\n\n1547\n01:29:39.170 --> 01:29:42.670\nsay, an algorithm that makes\nthis cryptography versus a code.\n\n1548\n01:29:42.670 --> 01:29:45.160\nThat would fall under\nthe code side of things?\n\n1549\n01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.580\nYeah, you could make a case for that.\n\n1550\n01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:50.850\nI think I'd probably be more interested in\ngeneral cryptography pool because you're\n\n1551\n01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:54.630\ntranslating over to another language\nrather than translate to a specific code.\n\n1552\n01:29:54.630 --> 01:29:58.450\nBecause when you do the language,\nthere's no special codes behind it.\n\n1553\n01:29:58.450 --> 01:30:01.240\nYou're just translating to\na completely different language,\n\n1554\n01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:04.310\nwhich is what a cryptograph\nalgorithm does.\n\n1555\n01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:09.050\nBut, it's one of those really\njust unusual, exciting,\n\n1556\n01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:13.880\nand fascinating things, you know,\nthat happen in the world of cryptography.\n\n1557\n01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:18.880\nIn fact I think, sadly I think\nthe last one of the last guys, or\n\n1558\n01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:26.030\nthe last person who was a Windtalker\npassed away in the last two, three years.\n\n1559\n01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:29.640\nSo, yeah, who were heroes\nshould be remembered for that.\n\n1560\n01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:32.020\nThere's a movie on it too,\nwith Nicolas Cage,\n\n1561\n01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.790\nif you kind of want to see\na fictionalized version of it.\n\n1562\n01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:40.800\nBut, yeah that's just one of the many\nchapters in cryptography that's out there.\n\n1563\n01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:41.750\n>> Very good.\n\n1564\n01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:44.930\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed today's episode.\n\n1565\n01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:47.190\nRemember, if you have a question\nwhile you're watching this show live,\n\n1566\n01:30:47.190 --> 01:30:49.970\nall you gotta do is get in that chatroom,\ntype in your question.\n\n1567\n01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:53.600\nWe're gonna see it live on air and\nwe're gonna respond to it live on air.\n\n1568\n01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.080\nIf you have a question after the fact.\n\n1569\n01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:58.400\nIf you're watching a recording of this\nshow you're not left out in the dark.\n\n1570\n01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.200\nUp at the top of every page is our Q and\nA link that takes you over to our forums.\n\n1571\n01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:03.560\nPost your question there.\n\n1572\n01:31:03.560 -->

another episode ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.670\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.010\nHow are you doing today, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.290\n>> Doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n7\n00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.620\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.990\nWe got another exciting\nepisode coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.345\nContinuing on with our\ncryptography episodes.\n\n10\n00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:52.390\nIn this one we're gonna talk about\nthe language of cryptography.\n\n11\n00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.050\nWe need to learn a lot\nof different terms so\n\n12\n00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.866\nthat we can go further\ninto our discussion.\n\n13\n00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:02.124\nSo let's dive in and and let's break down\nsome of these terms we're going to be\n\n14\n00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:04.650\nusing throughout the rest\nof these episodes.\n\n15\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.271\n>> Yeah.\nCryptography is one of those things that\n\n16\n00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:09.580\nreally has a language unto itself.\n\n17\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.720\nYou run into fields like\nthat all over the place.\n\n18\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.410\nMedical has it.\n\n19\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.750\nA lot of sciences have it.\n\n20\n00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.350\nYou pick really any type of field,\nheck, IT's got it.\n\n21\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.770\nPeople a lot of time don't know what we're\ntalking about in IT cuz of all the jargon\n\n22\n00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.360\nand abbreviations and\nacronyms we use so, and\n\n23\n00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.940\nslang and everything else, so crypto\nshouldn't be any different and so we need\n\n24\n00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.830\nto learn what those terms are and what\nthey mean and what their relevance is.\n\n25\n00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.636\nBefore we go any further and\nwe start getting eyes glazing over,\n\n26\n00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:47.560\npeople blanking out going,\nis this English still?\n\n27\n00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.771\n>> Yeah,\ngotta understand the basic terminology,\n\n28\n00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:54.983\nsome core concepts to make the rest\nof it make a little more sense.\n\n29\n00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:56.886\n>> Yes, that's crucial to get that.\n\n30\n00:01:56.886 --> 00:02:01.866\nSo the terms we talk about in\nthis particular episode are terms\n\n31\n00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:05.810\nthat are standard pretty\nmuch across the field.\n\n32\n00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.230\nYou won't see too much variation in\nthese terms, so that's the good thing.\n\n33\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.932\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's unlike things like IT where it\n\n34\n00:02:13.932 --> 00:02:16.160\ndepends which vendor you talk to.\n\n35\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.250\n>> Right.\n>> That they're gonna use their own terms\n\n36\n00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.140\njust to make themselves be different.\n\n37\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.660\nSo crypto's got, as one of the sciences,\nor based on one of the sciences\n\n38\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.960\nhas a pretty much unified language with\nlittle variation what so ever in it.\n\n39\n00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.450\n>> All right, so where do we start,\n\n40\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.538\nI guess first thing we gotta do\nis define cryptography itself?\n\n41\n00:02:35.538 --> 00:02:39.630\n>> Yes, so when we talk about\ncryptography as a field, cryptography\n\n42\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.390\ndeals with the science of\ndealing cryptosystems,\n\n43\n00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.440\nthe mechanics of them, algorithms and\nall the things underneath it.\n\n44\n00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.030\nBut there's other areas to be sure.\n\n45\n00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.920\nThere's cryptanalysis,\nwhich we'll talk about here.\n\n46\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.130\nYou know, there's things like\nhashing that throw in there.\n\n47\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.270\nAnd then there's a lot of other\nthings even outside that.\n\n48\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.340\nAnd you may recall from\nour previous episode,\n\n49\n00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.040\nI was even saying that\nthere's this larger field\n\n50\n00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.870\ncalled cryptology which the study\nof really the whole shooting match.\n\n51\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.060\nIt's actually a pretty\nbig body of knowledge.\n\n52\n00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.750\nYou know when we talk about cryptography,\n\n53\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.700\nwe're going to have to get\ninto the cryptology part.\n\n54\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.920\nUnless you just really, really want\nto go through and do a lot of math.\n\n55\n00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.540\nSome of you might want to do that.\n\n56\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.685\nSome of you might find it that\nfascinating that you that that's\n\n57\n00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:34.535\nthe direction you wanna go.\n\n58\n00:03:34.535 --> 00:03:36.625\nSo it's a big area.\n\n59\n00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:41.885\nIt is a major, major science that\nrequires that type of thinking and\n\n60\n00:03:41.885 --> 00:03:45.660\nthat type of knowledge to\nreally push anywhere in it.\n\n61\n00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.040\nIn fact, I would throw into that\ndiscussion or that comment that\n\n62\n00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.230\nto be successful as some of the developed\ncryptosystems are breaking it,\n\n63\n00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.430\nyou pretty much have to have\na good understanding of\n\n64\n00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.430\nthe sciences as well as have a very,\nvery good understanding of mathematics.\n\n65\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.630\nIf you don't have that,\n\n66\n00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.140\nas the mathematics part specifically,\nit's just not gonna fly.\n\n67\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.640\nThe people that develop cryptographic\nsystems and study all that,\n\n68\n00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.320\nthe majority of them are PhDs and\nstuff like that nowadays.\n\n69\n00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.790\nAnd they've got very,\nvery specialized knowledge.\n\n70\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.020\nAnd even those guys may even have\nsome that's a PhD or a couple PhDs\n\n71\n00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.620\nmaybe on staff that just specialized\nin the mathematics of it.\n\n72\n00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.140\nI've seen that sort of thing, guys that\ndon't even know what they're saying.\n\n73\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.160\nWhen I talk to some of the guys\nthat are that far into math,\n\n74\n00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.970\nthey're on a level all on their own.\n\n75\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.325\nBut it's a very intense field.\n\n76\n00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:52.870\nFortunately we're kind of exploring\nareas that make it easy for\n\n77\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.760\nus for everyday stuff without\ngetting into all those things.\n\n78\n00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.465\nBut you still gotta know the language\nbecause it's used at the higher\n\n79\n00:04:58.465 --> 00:04:59.450\nlevels too.\n\n80\n00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.130\n>> So we don't need a PhD to\nfinish these episodes, but\n\n81\n00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.170\nwe do have to have a basic knowledge\nof the terms and concepts.\n\n82\n00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.950\n>> Yeah.\n\n83\n00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.780\n>> Okay, good.\n\n84\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.652\n>> Some people are just gifted at it too.\n\n85\n00:05:08.652 --> 00:05:12.700\nI would say PhD's, nowadays,\nis typically required, but heck,\n\n86\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.400\nsome people are just really,\nreally gifted at this stuff.\n\n87\n00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.320\nThey can just look at something and\nfigure it out.\n\n88\n00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.700\nThere's been numerous cases in history\nwhere we've had people like that,\n\n89\n00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.760\nthat are just so far out in their thinking\nand so original with their thinking,\n\n90\n00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.574\nand just gifted that they can come\nup with some really just crazy\n\n91\n00:05:34.574 --> 00:05:39.980\nthings, and really good at breaking\ncodes and stuff like that.\n\n92\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.700\nI think people like in that\nmovie that just came out,\n\n93\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.620\nThe Imitation Game, which,\nrecommendation it's actually a very,\n\n94\n00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.470\nvery good movie and really captures\na lot of stuff with Enigma, and\n\n95\n00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.390\nthe type of people that\nwork with these systems.\n\n96\n00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.850\nIt's fascinating.\n\n97\n00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.330\nYou see people there that are just quirky.\n\n98\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And just crazy, but\n\n99\n00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.662\nthey're just scary smart.\n\n100\n00:06:04.662 --> 00:06:12.140\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so let's talk\nabout some of these core concepts.\n\n101\n00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.380\nI think one of the, or some common\nmisnomers might be a good way to say it.\n\n102\n00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.310\nOne I think you start with here is,\nis cryptography breakable?\n\n103\n00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.690\n>> Yeah, that's a big,\nbig misconception or\n\n104\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.700\nmyth with cryptography,\nis that if you encrypt something,\n\n105\n00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.400\nit's unbreakable when you get\nto a certain point at least.\n\n106\n00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.740\nWe've seen the movies,\n\n107\n00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.550\nyou've heard stuff out there in the field\nabout people breaking cryptosystems.\n\n108\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.360\nBut the reality is that cryptosystems,\n\n109\n00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.760\nlike anything else,\nare something that is breakable.\n\n110\n00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.070\nAnd it's just a matter of,\ndo you have the horsepower to do it and\n\n111\n00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.510\nthe form of computing power or time,\ndo you have the brainpower there to do it,\n\n112\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.020\nand do you have some measure of luck,\nI guess this is another thing to throw in.\n\n113\n00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.620\nIf you look at the things that we\ntalked about in the first episode about\n\n114\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.600\nthings like Enigma and Purple and\nsome of these various ones.\n\n115\n00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.280\nSome of those were not just,\n\n116\n00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.200\nit wasn't just the science and\nthe technology that made them breakable.\n\n117\n00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:28.430\nIt was also in some cases, just luck that,\nthere was a healthy dose of luck mixed\n\n118\n00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.470\ninto the picture that made the breaking\nof those devices and systems possible.\n\n119\n00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.130\nBut in the end, except for\na couple exceptions,\n\n120\n00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.780\ncryptography, any sort of\nencryption can be broken.\n\n121\n00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.040\nIt's a question of time and effort and\n\n122\n00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.240\nhow much resources you can\nthrow at it to make it happen.\n\n123\n00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.320\nAnd if you get long enough keys and\n\n124\n00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.470\na powerful enough algorithm, you'll\nbreak it, but, it may not be useful.\n\n125\n00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.562\nI mean, heck,\n\n126\n00:07:56.562 --> 00:08:01.953\nthere's at least one algorithm out\nthere that they've done this study on.\n\n127\n00:08:01.953 --> 00:08:06.423\nThat by the time you were actually\nable to brute force the algorithm and\n\n128\n00:08:06.423 --> 00:08:11.045\nfigure out what the right key was,\nstatistically to go through the whole\n\n129\n00:08:11.045 --> 00:08:16.045\nrange of keys that are possible algorithm,\nthey said the sun would burn out and\n\n130\n00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:17.410\nyou'd probably\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n131\n00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:18.850\n>> and the universe would probably be over\n\n132\n00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.030\nat that point.\n\n133\n00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:25.180\nSo, I'm guessing that's probably not the\nfirst thing on your mind at that point.\n\n134\n00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.210\nHey, the universe is going\nthrough a heat death, and\n\n135\n00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.680\nI got to figure out the key to this.\n\n136\n00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.730\nNo, that's not.\n\n137\n00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:30.949\nThat's probably not something-\n>> I'm almost done,\n\n138\n00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:32.010\ngive me one more second.\n\n139\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.380\n>> Yeah.\n>> One more second, come on.\n\n140\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.156\nYeah.\n>> Yeah, after everything's just gone\n\n141\n00:08:35.156 --> 00:08:38.640\n[SOUND], and disappeared, it's like,\noh another minute I would have had it.\n\n142\n00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.421\nYou know, that just shows you that yeah,\n\n143\n00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:45.789\nit's going to take you a heck of\na long time, but you can do it, and\n\n144\n00:08:45.789 --> 00:08:49.310\nit just wouldn't be useful\nby the time you found it.\n\n145\n00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.720\n>> And that really is the nature of\nmost of these encryption algorithms.\n\n146\n00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.840\nThe point is to be able to get the data\nback out, so the formulas are designed\n\n147\n00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.120\nto be able to retrieve the data\nwith the proper information.\n\n148\n00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.960\nSo it just makes sense that\nI can figure that out and\n\n149\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.280\nI can break it, and as you say,\nthe question isn't, can I.\n\n150\n00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.150\nIt's how long will it take, and how much\nprocessing power is it gonna take, and\n\n151\n00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.590\ncan I get enough of that processing power,\nand do I have enough time to break it?\n\n152\n00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.650\nIf there was no point, if I couldn't\nget the information back out,\n\n153\n00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.670\nthen cryptography wouldn't\nserve a huge purpose except for\n\n154\n00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.750\nthe hashing which we're gonna\nbreak down a little bit later.\n\n155\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.788\nSo yeah,\nit just makes sense that it is breakable.\n\n156\n00:09:28.788 --> 00:09:32.460\n>> Yeah, there's no.\n\n157\n00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.178\nLike I said, with a couple notable\nexceptions, there's really no\n\n158\n00:09:37.178 --> 00:09:42.330\nperfect crypto system out there that\nis considered to be unbreakable.\n\n159\n00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:48.120\nIt's a question of just how much\ntime do you have to break it,\n\n160\n00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.460\nand just how lucky you are.\n\n161\n00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.340\nYou might be incredibly luck and are able\nto start break these things like that.\n\n162\n00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.580\nBut it might just be that, more than\nlikely it's not gonna be the lucky part.\n\n163\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.420\nIt's gonna be you just don't have\nthe power to do it right now.\n\n164\n00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:11.160\nAnd therefore it's unbreakable or\ngonna take exceedingly long time.\n\n165\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.360\nHowever, this is gonna start changing.\n\n166\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.550\nAs we said in the first episode,\nwe said technology and\n\n167\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.360\nother things have kind of metamorphosized,\nand\n\n168\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.970\nare continuing to metamorphosize and shape\nand mold the direction of cryptography.\n\n169\n00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.000\nOne of the things that was mentioned\ntowards the end of that episode as well\n\n170\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.620\nwas quantum cryptography, and\n\n171\n00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:40.680\nthen I threw in quantum mechanics and\nquantum computing.\n\n172\n00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.770\nQuantum computing represents\nthe next generation of computers.\n\n173\n00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:49.030\nThey just have not been built on\na large enough practical scale yet.\n\n174\n00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.370\nBut they do exist right now.\n\n175\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.995\nThere are actually working models.\n\n176\n00:10:54.995 --> 00:10:58.335\nIBM, I believe,\nhas at least two of them right now.\n\n177\n00:10:58.335 --> 00:11:02.679\nAnd the things are so fast that that\nalgorithm that I was talking about that\n\n178\n00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:05.974\nwould, the universe would go\npoof before you broke it,\n\n179\n00:11:05.974 --> 00:11:10.530\nthat same algorithm switched over to\na low to medium powered quantum computer\n\n180\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:15.015\nthat they have on a drawing board right\nnow, that would be breakable in a time\n\n181\n00:11:15.015 --> 00:11:18.165\nshorter than it would take\nyou to blink off your eye.\n\n182\n00:11:18.165 --> 00:11:19.203\n>> [LAUGH] Wow.\n\n183\n00:11:19.203 --> 00:11:22.333\n>> So you're talking a rewriting\nof the rulebook once\n\n184\n00:11:22.333 --> 00:11:24.363\nthose things become available.\n\n185\n00:11:24.363 --> 00:11:27.243\nSo, like I said, it's an evolving field,\n\n186\n00:11:27.243 --> 00:11:30.523\nbut that means all those algorithms\nare saying now, they're unbreakable.\n\n187\n00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.115\nNo, they're not.\nYou just don't have the computing\n\n188\n00:11:32.115 --> 00:11:32.983\npower to do it yet.\n\n189\n00:11:32.983 --> 00:11:34.918\nBut it is coming.\n\n190\n00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:36.473\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n191\n00:11:36.473 --> 00:11:39.933\nthen another one we always hear is that\nall encryption algorithms are the same.\n\n192\n00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:42.060\nIt really doesn't matter which one I use.\n\n193\n00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.160\nEncrypted is encrypted.\n\n194\n00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:43.830\nRight?\n\n195\n00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.180\n>> Yeah.\nEncrypted is not encrypted.\n\n196\n00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.470\nIt's definitely not that at all.\n\n197\n00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:55.800\nWhat you have is,\nyou have different types of algorithms.\n\n198\n00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.420\nYou have things like symmetric,\n\n199\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:02.150\nasymmetric, hashing just to mention\nthose three, we have those types.\n\n200\n00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.450\nBut then you break it\ndown underneath those.\n\n201\n00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.820\nThere's different strengths,\n\n202\n00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:11.090\nthere's different ways of combining\ntechniques to make an algorithm.\n\n203\n00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.360\nThen you occasionally find\nones that have flaws in them.\n\n204\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.690\nIn fact, there's been a lot of flaws\nfound over the years in algorithms,\n\n205\n00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.050\nand that can make them weaker or\nstronger than something else.\n\n206\n00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:23.920\nOr I shouldn't say stronger,\n\n207\n00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.460\nthey're pretty much always gonna make\nthem weaker than they should be, and\n\n208\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:33.760\nweaker than other algorithms, but\nthey're definitely not all the same.\n\n209\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.680\nAnd that's a big mistake you can make and\n\n210\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:41.080\nit has been made numerous\ntimes over in history.\n\n211\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.750\nEven recent history there's been\nnumerous times that that's happened.\n\n212\n00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.198\nWe have a prime example, and\n\n213\n00:12:48.198 --> 00:12:53.100\nthat's something we were talking about\nin the CEH course and CHFI course, and\n\n214\n00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.606\na lot of you already know this,\nwe talk about WEP for wireless.\n\n215\n00:12:57.606 --> 00:13:02.280\nThe algorithm that they used for WEP was\nactually a pretty decent algorithm, but\n\n216\n00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.680\nthe fact of the matter is\nthe people that implemented it\n\n217\n00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.170\ndidn't understand\ncryptography well enough and\n\n218\n00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.430\nhow encryption worked well enough to\nreally implement it correctly and\n\n219\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.220\nchoose the appropriate one for\nthat specific situation.\n\n220\n00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.120\nThey just said okay,\nwell we heard that's a good algorithm,\n\n221\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.920\njust grab one of those off the shelf,\nshove it in there and we're done.\n\n222\n00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.870\nWhat the result was is you had a system\nthat was so poorly implemented and\n\n223\n00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.210\nweak that its laughable\nin its strength nowadays.\n\n224\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.770\nIt can be broken pretty\nmuch at the drop of a hat,\n\n225\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.730\nwith just a few simple tools,\nand just a little bit of time.\n\n226\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.490\nVery, very little amount of time.\n\n227\n00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.720\nAnd then, you and I were talking, Mike,\nabout that one, at the break I just saw,\n\n228\n00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.340\nI didn't have a chance to read\nthe whole article on it, but\n\n229\n00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.300\nI pulled it up during\nthe break we just had.\n\n230\n00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:53.010\nI know at least here in the US, I don't\nknow how it works in other countries, but\n\n231\n00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:57.300\nhere in the US, they're in the process\nof implementing these smart meters for\n\n232\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.980\nthe whole smart grid to do\nbetter power management.\n\n233\n00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:07.010\nThey're either going to or they already\nhave put a meter on the side of\n\n234\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:12.430\nyour house or dwelling that is gonna be\nable to communicate wirelessly, and do\n\n235\n00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:17.900\nall this neat stuff, to optimize the usage\nof electricity and all that good stuff.\n\n236\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:23.090\nWell, it was said from the very\nbeginning that those systems\n\n237\n00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.340\nweren't tested properly, and\nthat there were certain design flaws, and\n\n238\n00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.290\nthat they could be hacked, and\nwe get the same thing all the time.\n\n239\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.320\nAgain, we talk about\nit in the CEH courses.\n\n240\n00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.460\nYou get that problem with people saying,\nnobody's gonna do that,\n\n241\n00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.790\nyou're fear-mongering.\n\n242\n00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.960\nJust relax and calm down.\n\n243\n00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.120\nWell, guess what?\n\n244\n00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.650\nThe protocol that they designed, this open\nprotocol they came up with, that all these\n\n245\n00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.800\ndevices are designed to communicate\nover and share as a common thing.\n\n246\n00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.170\nIt's found to have a weakness.\n\n247\n00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:58.720\nThey said that the wording from the\narticle I saw says it is easily breakable.\n\n248\n00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.170\n>> [LAUGH] It hadn't even\nbeen implemented yet, so.\n\n249\n00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:01.840\n>> Yeah.\n\n250\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.910\nIt's barely out there or whatever and\nit's just yeah, it's easily breakable.\n\n251\n00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:13.240\nSo, looks like what you had is you had\na similar situation that you had with WEP,\n\n252\n00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.600\nis you had people that thought all these\nalgorithms were the same, no problem.\n\n253\n00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.965\nJust pick one that sounds good or\n\n254\n00:15:19.965 --> 00:15:24.300\nit's got a good reputation, shove it\nin here, and go ahead and start her up.\n\n255\n00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.450\nNow you have a situation where, who knows,\n\n256\n00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.430\nthey might have to do a lot\nof firmware upgrades.\n\n257\n00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.700\nThey may even have to, in some cases,\n\n258\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.080\nhave to be something that's ripped out and\nreplaced.\n\n259\n00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.860\nIt's not unheard of for that to happen.\n\n260\n00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.450\nAnd it's gonna happen again.\n\n261\n00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.810\nIt'll happen again and\nagain and again and again.\n\n262\n00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:50.640\nOne of my pet peeves I see that\ngoes along these same lines is,\n\n263\n00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.671\nyou don't see this much anymore, but\n\n264\n00:15:53.671 --> 00:15:59.374\nyou'll see software developers and\nhardware developers primarily.\n\n265\n00:15:59.374 --> 00:16:04.033\nThey will put out a product that has to\nhave some sort of encryption in it And\n\n266\n00:16:04.033 --> 00:16:08.392\nbecause it's been mandated or\njust for common sense, and instead of\n\n267\n00:16:08.392 --> 00:16:13.278\ngoing through and learning or licensing or\nwhatever, a proper algorithm and\n\n268\n00:16:13.278 --> 00:16:17.420\nimplement it correctly,\nthey will develop their own in house.\n\n269\n00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.170\nAnd they'll say something like oh it's for\n\n270\n00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:25.100\nexample AES like encryption or\ntripled as level encryption.\n\n271\n00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.760\nThey'll say something like that, and the\naverage consumer reads that and says oh if\n\n272\n00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:35.610\nthey understand what those terms mean at\nall they'll go oh, AES, that's AES-like.\n\n273\n00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.310\nOh well, I know what AES is and\nthat's all they read.\n\n274\n00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:42.450\nTheir brain shuts off past that, and they\njust go and run to the register, buy it,\n\n275\n00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.120\nand implement it.\n\n276\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.048\nAnd next thing you know,\nthey're getting busted into.\n\n277\n00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:53.440\nSo they're definitely, those are not on\npar with the professional grade ones.\n\n278\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.110\nThe professional grade ones\nthat are made by people that\n\n279\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.700\nreally know what they're doing go\nthrough a lengthy review process.\n\n280\n00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.330\nThey have a lot of people with their\neyeballs on it and there's a lot of time\n\n281\n00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:09.750\nand care taken and everything else to\nmake sure that they are safe to use.\n\n282\n00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.340\nAnd there's not a problem, cryptography's\nnot an easy thing to do right.\n\n283\n00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.564\nIt's very tough to do right,\nand the best even screw it up.\n\n284\n00:17:17.564 --> 00:17:20.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One of the guys that\n\n285\n00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.440\nI'm going to mention here Ron Revest that\nactually created, helped found RSA and\n\n286\n00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.840\nthe RSA algorithm with his two buddies.\n\n287\n00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:34.350\nHe works at MIT in\nthe northeastern United States so\n\n288\n00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:38.610\nhe's up there and he still creates\nalgorithms from time to time.\n\n289\n00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:41.230\nHe's had some misses Ii\nhe can't get it right and\n\n290\n00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.660\nthe guy created all this fancy stuff.\n\n291\n00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.800\nDo I really trust some a,\nyou know a computer programmer?\n\n292\n00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.230\nThat has had a few years experience and\nprobably good at programming but\n\n293\n00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.310\nknows nothing about this.\n\n294\n00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:58.220\nGoing to be like, I read some stuff on\nGoogle, on Wikipedia and stuff like that.\n\n295\n00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:58.823\nI can do it.\n\n296\n00:17:58.823 --> 00:18:00.842\nNo you really can't.\n\n297\n00:18:00.842 --> 00:18:05.538\n>> [LAUGH] So,\nin another one I hear all the time,\n\n298\n00:18:05.538 --> 00:18:11.633\ncryptography can only be\nunderstood by mathematicians.\n\n299\n00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:16.065\n>> Yeah we've said this already,\na handful of times.\n\n300\n00:18:16.065 --> 00:18:21.053\nAnd, I just want to emphasize, I don't\nthink you can emphasize enough, really,\n\n301\n00:18:21.053 --> 00:18:25.755\nthat this is not something that you have\nto be, have to have a good mathematical\n\n302\n00:18:25.755 --> 00:18:29.916\nbackground, to understand at least\nat the level we're talking at.\n\n303\n00:18:29.916 --> 00:18:35.059\nIf you push further up the chain,\nthen yes, there's no way you're\n\n304\n00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:40.205\ngonna get to the intermediate and\nadvanced levels and above without\n\n305\n00:18:40.205 --> 00:18:45.726\nhaving a good knowledge of all those\nhigher end mathematical concepts.\n\n306\n00:18:45.726 --> 00:18:49.847\nBut for here we can understand\nall these concepts just by doing\n\n307\n00:18:49.847 --> 00:18:52.621\nthings like puzzles and samples of them,\n\n308\n00:18:52.621 --> 00:18:57.550\nyou can get it fairly easily and\nreally that's all you need to know.\n\n309\n00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:02.540\nI don't need a world class cryptographer\n\n310\n00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:07.400\nthat's got you know all these got\nall these degrees and all that.\n\n311\n00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.540\nI mean heck, if you can get one,\ncan afford it,\n\n312\n00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:13.150\nthen hey, I guess if you wanna do that.\n\n313\n00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:17.810\nBut I don't need you, or does anyone need\nyou to have that level of experience.\n\n314\n00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:22.690\nIt's good for you to understand what\nthey are and see what they do and so\n\n315\n00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.920\nwhen you see them in documentation and\nmanuals, or\n\n316\n00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.510\nwhen you're doing stuff like the CEH or\nyou're doing stuff like\n\n317\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:35.520\nthe forensic investigation, you know\nwhat the implications of that are.\n\n318\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.310\nBeing able to simply understand which\nis symmetric, asymmetric, and hashing.\n\n319\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:44.360\nNo one knows algorithms,\nthose different classes of algorithms,\n\n320\n00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.850\nand what they mean, and\nwhere they're used, and benefits and\n\n321\n00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:52.970\ndrawbacks to them will,\nbe a tremendous benefit.\n\n322\n00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:57.920\nAll of it done without having to\nhave a lot of of math required.\n\n323\n00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.190\nOr any math required.\n\n324\n00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.010\n>> And that's really the point\nof your whole book right?\n\n325\n00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.740\nIs the fact that we don't have to be a\nmathematician to get into cryptography and\n\n326\n00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.080\nunderstand how cryptography works and\n\n327\n00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.090\nmake good decisions when it comes\nto working with cryptography.\n\n328\n00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.149\nI really liked your analogy you used\nabout the mechanic versus the driver.\n\n329\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.420\nAnd if you wanna tell em that one.\n\n330\n00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.180\n>> Go ahead.\n\n331\n00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:24.290\n>> I forget exactly how you worded it, but\nany mechanic knows how that engine works.\n\n332\n00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.170\nI can drive a car though.\n\n333\n00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.850\nI don't need to understand how\nthe car works underneath the hood\n\n334\n00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.820\nI can still drive the car just fine.\n\n335\n00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:35.010\nAnd it's the same thing when it\ncomes to these cryptographic,\n\n336\n00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.650\nwhat's a good way to say it?\n\n337\n00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.750\nImplementing cryptography,\nwe'll say it that way.\n\n338\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.030\nI don't really need to understand\nthe formula that it's using\n\n339\n00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.490\nunderneath the hood.\n\n340\n00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.620\nI need to know how it works in general,\nwhether it's asymmetric, symmetric, and\n\n341\n00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.300\nthings like that, and whether or\nnot it's strong enough for\n\n342\n00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.750\nthis particular implementation.\n\n343\n00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.730\nBut I don't need to break down\nthe actual algorithm itself.\n\n344\n00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:00.150\n>> Yeah that's really\nwhat it boils down to.\n\n345\n00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:07.250\nYou don't need to get into those fine nuts\nand bolts of things I mean some of them\n\n346\n00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:12.440\nare kind of somewhat easy to understand\nwhen you start drilling underneath it,\n\n347\n00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:17.488\nbut other ones, you don't have\nreally a snowflake's chance.\n\n348\n00:21:17.488 --> 00:21:19.094\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n349\n00:21:19.094 --> 00:21:21.755\n>> To grasp it without\nthat higher end knowledge.\n\n350\n00:21:21.755 --> 00:21:25.460\nSo you look at things like AES and\n\n351\n00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:31.020\nstuff like that, those start really\nraising, or upping the ante on you.\n\n352\n00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.360\nSo you've gotta have\nthat background to do it.\n\n353\n00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.790\nBut some people are just gifted on it.\n\n354\n00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.595\nI read someone that,\n\n355\n00:21:37.595 --> 00:21:43.625\nI didn't run to the guy specifically\nbecause that would of been scary.\n\n356\n00:21:43.625 --> 00:21:45.965\nI had one of the guys friends, was\n\n357\n00:21:47.905 --> 00:21:52.367\nactually when I was doing some\ncontracting with the Air Force here.\n\n358\n00:21:52.367 --> 00:21:57.127\nThis guy said he had someone who was one\nof his subordinates that the guy was\n\n359\n00:21:57.127 --> 00:21:59.567\nalmost on a different planet\nwith this type of thinking.\n\n360\n00:21:59.567 --> 00:22:04.390\nHe said this guy would actually for fun\ndeveloped his own encryption algorithm,\n\n361\n00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.170\nand stuff like that.\n\n362\n00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.410\nAnd so the guy was actually\nreally good at it too,\n\n363\n00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.610\nhe said this was his way of having fun.\n\n364\n00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.290\nHe would just go out there and\nwrite these things and\n\n365\n00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.210\nfigure out how they tick and all that.\n\n366\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.270\nAnd try to make stronger and\nstronger ones and\n\n367\n00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.790\nI'm thinking, this guy does this for fun.\n\n368\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.660\nI'm like, wow, yeah.\n\n369\n00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.770\n>> Fun is a relative term.\n\n370\n00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:27.410\n>> Yeah, I guess so.\n\n371\n00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:30.730\nBut that's what this guy did.\n\n372\n00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.205\nAnd there are people like that that just\n\n373\n00:22:34.205 --> 00:22:39.090\nhave that built-in ability\nto grasp these things.\n\n374\n00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:45.760\nBen even made this reference\nto A Beautiful Mind in there.\n\n375\n00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.125\nThat's another good example of it.\n\n376\n00:22:48.125 --> 00:22:50.490\nThere's people like that,\nthat can just see the patterns.\n\n377\n00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:55.480\nThey just emerge to them through all\nthe all the stuff that we see as noise and\n\n378\n00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.120\njust randomness and all this chaos,\nit just floats to the surface and\n\n379\n00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.740\nlike well how can, why can't you see that.\n\n380\n00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.650\n>> Right.\n\n381\n00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.990\n>> It's a really, really-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:11.631\n>> Weird thing when you think about it.\n\n383\n00:23:11.631 --> 00:23:12.849\n>> All right, well, I tell you what.\n\n384\n00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:15.159\nLadies and gentlemen, it's about time for\nus to take a break so\n\n385\n00:23:15.159 --> 00:23:16.083\nwhy don't we stop here.\n\n386\n00:23:16.083 --> 00:23:19.560\nWhen we come back, we're gonna continue\non with the language of cryptography.\n\n387\n00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.658\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n388\n00:23:21.658 --> 00:23:28.120\n[MUSIC]\n\n389\n00:23:30.354 --> 00:23:32.220\nAll right welcome back ladies and\ngentleman.\n\n390\n00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.960\nSo continuing on with our\nlanguage of cryptography.\n\n391\n00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.110\nWe got a bunch of terms that we're gonna\nneed to be familiar with as we progress\n\n392\n00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:44.490\nthrough our episodes we're gonna stop and\nexplain some of these terms.\n\n393\n00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.330\nSo what do we start with Sean?\n\n394\n00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.990\nYeah, there's a whole bunch of terms here.\n\n395\n00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.010\n>> Alphabet soup, right?\n\n396\n00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.592\n>> Yeah, and the terms we're\ngonna go through, by the way,\n\n397\n00:23:53.592 --> 00:23:54.868\nare in no particular order.\n\n398\n00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:58.650\nIt doesn't mean that hey, this one's more\nimportant than this one or whatever.\n\n399\n00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.077\nIt's just terms that.\n\n400\n00:24:00.077 --> 00:24:06.268\nYou're gonna hear during the course as\nwe go through different episodes and\n\n401\n00:24:06.268 --> 00:24:13.460\nstuff like that, you're gonna hear them\npop up and just clear up any confusion.\n\n402\n00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.840\nSo if you wanna take notes,\nnow may be a good time to do that.\n\n403\n00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.830\nIf not, I'll make sure when we encounter\nthem again, at least the first few times,\n\n404\n00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:26.720\nthat I make sure you understand where I'm\ngoing with it, but just ahead of time,\n\n405\n00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.590\nto make sure we're all on the same page.\n\n406\n00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.010\nAnd we know the language, and\n\n407\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.130\nwe understand some of\nthe terms ahead of time.\n\n408\n00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:33.820\nWe'll just go ahead and\n\n409\n00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:38.100\ntalk about to make sure that we've\ngot a little comfort level with them.\n\n410\n00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.530\nAnd so you're like, oh, yeah,\nI kind of remember that.\n\n411\n00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.220\nIt takes a little bit, trust me.\n\n412\n00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:47.110\nIt takes a little bit with some of these\nterms to kinda get comfortable with them.\n\n413\n00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.200\nUndoubtedly you've heard\nsome of them already,\n\n414\n00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:56.000\nespecially if you're working in IT or\nyou did the CEH or the CHFI\n\n415\n00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:02.490\nwith me and Mike, you remember some of the\nstuff or heard some of the stuff but we're\n\n416\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:07.060\nintroducing a whole bunch of new things\nin here that are gonna muddy the waters.\n\n417\n00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.232\nWe figure we gave you the weekend\nto kind of relax and shake it off.\n\n418\n00:25:10.232 --> 00:25:13.004\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now we're gonna jack you up and\n\n419\n00:25:13.004 --> 00:25:14.850\nput all this stuff in there.\n\n420\n00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.337\nYou're like,\n[SOUND] you think they got it?\n\n421\n00:25:16.337 --> 00:25:16.917\nAll right.\n\n422\n00:25:16.917 --> 00:25:21.860\n>> [LAUGH] All right so\nlet's start off with one that we've used\n\n423\n00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.170\na couple of times already on\nour episode is algorithm.\n\n424\n00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:29.880\n>> Yes, algorithm is one of those\nterms that you hear a lot and\n\n425\n00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.440\nyou know there's a good amount\nof time it is used incorrectly.\n\n426\n00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.780\nBut it is something that is out there and\n\n427\n00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:40.940\nyou do have to know if we're going\nto be going any further into this.\n\n428\n00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:45.710\nAlgorithms come in many different\nshapes and sizes and types and\n\n429\n00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.800\ncapabilities and features,\nyou can go on and on with it.\n\n430\n00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.630\nAnd we will be going on and on with it,\n\n431\n00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:55.800\ncuz we're going to be talking about the\ndifferent forms that cryptography takes.\n\n432\n00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.650\nThat's what we're here for.\n\n433\n00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:03.640\nBut they do share a common\ndescription overall of what they do,\n\n434\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.560\nor of what they're supposed to be doing,\nrather.\n\n435\n00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:13.470\nAnd to help us out with it, we had a kind\nof, I hope it was a interesting and\n\n436\n00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.890\na good informational exercise for you, to\ngo through that whole thing with history.\n\n437\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.752\nWe had some fun with that.\n\n438\n00:26:19.752 --> 00:26:22.630\nIt's always kind of fun,\nat least I think so, and\n\n439\n00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.490\nI think there's probably a number of you\nout there as well as here that think it's\n\n440\n00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.350\ninteresting, but\nthere is some value there.\n\n441\n00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:35.320\nLike I said, those examples\nwere gonna be use later on to\n\n442\n00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.350\nallow us understand stuff a little better.\n\n443\n00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:42.470\nSo what I'm gonna use to\ndescribe an algorithm,\n\n444\n00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.110\nI'm gonna borrow the Caesar\ncipher from before.\n\n445\n00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:51.900\nThe Caesar cipher,\njust to refresh our knowledge on it,\n\n446\n00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.070\nallows us to take a message in it's plain,\n\n447\n00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:01.480\nunencrypted form, and then shift those\nletters a certain number of spaces.\n\n448\n00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.200\nAnd then replace them with a new\ncharacter that resides at that position.\n\n449\n00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.800\nAnd we just basically rinse and\n\n450\n00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.480\nrepeat all the way down the whole\nmessage til we're done.\n\n451\n00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.790\nNow that's in essence\nthe whole Cesar cipher.\n\n452\n00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.410\nI made it kind of ambiguous.\n\n453\n00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.640\nIf you notice,\nI did make it very ambiguous.\n\n454\n00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.990\nDidn't it say the Cesar cipher, shift\nthree spaces to the right to encrypt and\n\n455\n00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.470\nthree spaces to the left\nto go the other way.\n\n456\n00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.370\nYou brought up ROT13.\n\n457\n00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.110\nSame deal.\n\n458\n00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:35.880\n13 spaces one way, 13 spaces the other\nway to reverse the operation.\n\n459\n00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.070\nSimple as that.\n\n460\n00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:42.680\nSo the way I phrased it, notice the way\nI phrase it, I said, you take something,\n\n461\n00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:50.090\nyour plain, unencrypted stuff and\nyou shift a number of spaces, and I'll say\n\n462\n00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:55.310\na number of spaces to the right, and that\ngives you your encrypted message, okay?\n\n463\n00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:59.465\nIf we look at look at that,\nin terms of mathematics.\n\n464\n00:27:59.465 --> 00:28:00.925\nAnd this is just to keep it really simple,\n\n465\n00:28:00.925 --> 00:28:03.675\nI'm gonna make this, and\nI'm not gonna do any complex math on you.\n\n466\n00:28:03.675 --> 00:28:04.505\nDon't worry.\n\n467\n00:28:04.505 --> 00:28:09.300\nI told you I wasn't going to, this is\nabout as complex as it gets in here.\n\n468\n00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.590\nIf you were to look at every\nnumber in the alphabet.\n\n469\n00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:16.040\nOr every letter in the alpha, number,\nthat's how screwed up this is.\n\n470\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:21.501\nSo if you are looking at every letter in\nthe alphabet and assigned it a number for\n\n471\n00:28:21.501 --> 00:28:26.906\nrepresenting its position, and then\nalso throw in the number zero in there.\n\n472\n00:28:26.906 --> 00:28:32.080\nYou got 27 numbers there, 0 through 26.\n\n473\n00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.140\nAnd so, we're gonna ignore the zero for\nright now.\n\n474\n00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.455\nIf A is one,\nif you have the Caesar cipher,\n\n475\n00:28:39.455 --> 00:28:41.915\nyou're gonna add on three\nof that to get four.\n\n476\n00:28:41.915 --> 00:28:43.665\nThen you go over to where\nthe fourth position is and\n\n477\n00:28:43.665 --> 00:28:45.645\nyou keep doing that all\nthe way down the line.\n\n478\n00:28:45.645 --> 00:28:50.515\nAnything over 26, if you have a letter and\n\n479\n00:28:50.515 --> 00:28:54.885\nyou add three to it, and\nyou get 27, what are you gonna do?\n\n480\n00:28:54.885 --> 00:28:56.875\nYou do the same thing.\n\n481\n00:28:56.875 --> 00:29:00.335\nYour letter, you add on that number three.\n\n482\n00:29:00.335 --> 00:29:00.995\nYou get 27.\n\n483\n00:29:00.995 --> 00:29:04.490\nThen you subtract 26 and it gives you A.\n\n484\n00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.910\nSo, cuz it's gonna come up with one,\nthat's a spot.\n\n485\n00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.620\nYou add have more than 26 letters.\n\n486\n00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:13.350\nSo that's as simple as that.\n\n487\n00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:16.370\nSo what we're showing here is\nwe're showing an algorithm.\n\n488\n00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.760\nAn algorithm is the letter,\nor its position,\n\n489\n00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.600\nplus whatever key you're using,\nequals the encrypted form.\n\n490\n00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.630\nAnd to reverse that,\nyou just go through and\n\n491\n00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:31.050\njust do the same process, but backwards.\n\n492\n00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:35.930\nYou subtract from whatever the encrypted\nvalue is in the position in the alphabet.\n\n493\n00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:41.480\nYou need to subtract that key from it\nto give the original unencrypted value.\n\n494\n00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:47.620\nSo that is, and if you kind of visualize\nthat, that is an algorithm right there.\n\n495\n00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.530\nIt tells you, do this,\nadd this to get that.\n\n496\n00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:54.360\nThere could be different operations\nin there, but same basic concept.\n\n497\n00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.970\nThe Caesar cipher just\nhappens to be hopefully,\n\n498\n00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:01.340\nwhen I put it in those terms I didn't\nhave any eyes glazing over out there.\n\n499\n00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.180\nHopefully that made sense to you.\n\n500\n00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.290\nI think it's actually works pretty well.\n\n501\n00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.485\nThat same process works across the board.\n\n502\n00:30:11.485 --> 00:30:16.310\nAn algorithm, gonna do something,\nbut you put something in one end,\n\n503\n00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:19.420\nit gets manipulated, and\nthen comes out the other side.\n\n504\n00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:23.440\nYou can also use Ben's example or Ben's\ndescription here in the discussion groups.\n\n505\n00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.840\nThat's excitable too,\nyou know, that's getting\n\n506\n00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.556\na little more technical about it but\nis a totally acceptable description,\n\n507\n00:30:31.556 --> 00:30:34.100\na finite set of steps to\nresolve a particular problem.\n\n508\n00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:40.086\nI like it, we know what that means,\nsame type of thing.\n\n509\n00:30:40.086 --> 00:30:43.860\nSo an algorithm represents how the\nencryption process is gonna take place,\n\n510\n00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:48.675\nso that's the important thing to know.\n\n511\n00:30:48.675 --> 00:30:53.568\nSo other places you've\nheard the term algorithm,\n\n512\n00:30:53.568 --> 00:30:58.017\nthis is the way we're\nreferring to it in here.\n\n513\n00:30:58.017 --> 00:31:01.749\nTechnically that definition for\nthat algorithm should work any place but\n\n514\n00:31:01.749 --> 00:31:05.030\nsometimes people get a little\nfunky with it and stuff like that.\n\n515\n00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.840\nWe'll just stick with this one for here.\n\n516\n00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.060\n>> All right, very good, so\nwe've got our algorithms and\n\n517\n00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:14.350\nthen we've got some terms, again more\nterms that we might be familiar with,\n\n518\n00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.950\njust want to make sure\nwe're on the same page.\n\n519\n00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.900\nEncryption and\nthen its counterpart, decryption.\n\n520\n00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.960\n>> Yes, these two are right\naround one another is when\n\n521\n00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.570\nit may sound dumb to go and talk about it,\nbecause I've had that before.\n\n522\n00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:33.020\nPeople are going, why are you\ntelling us what encryption means?\n\n523\n00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.140\nWhy tell us what decryption means?\n\n524\n00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.706\nBecause it gets screwed up, that's why.\n\n525\n00:31:36.706 --> 00:31:40.210\nAnd make sure you're not\none of those people.\n\n526\n00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.540\nSo all right, so [LAUGH].\n\n527\n00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.900\n>> Hey, I never said I was\na nice guy as a teacher.\n\n528\n00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.365\nI just said I know my stuff.\n\n529\n00:31:46.365 --> 00:31:48.708\n[LAUGH] Not even that really.\n\n530\n00:31:48.708 --> 00:31:50.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n531\n00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.970\nthe thing is that just making\nsure that we understand these.\n\n532\n00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.887\nI unfortunately see people\nuse the term encryption and\n\n533\n00:31:57.887 --> 00:32:00.280\nthen never use the term decrypt.\n\n534\n00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.180\nThey just keep going encrypt,\nencrypt, encrypt.\n\n535\n00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:08.012\nEncrypt is one term and\nrepresents It's one part of the process.\n\n536\n00:32:08.012 --> 00:32:10.037\nWhen you talk about encryption,\n\n537\n00:32:10.037 --> 00:32:14.810\nit means you are converting from its\nunencrypted form, to our readable form,\n\n538\n00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:18.863\nto something that's gonna be\ntransformed through an algorithm,\n\n539\n00:32:18.863 --> 00:32:23.860\nto something that's scrambled in some way,\nor at least looked scrambled.\n\n540\n00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.370\nI don't want you to think that\nwhen it goes to an algorithm, oh,\n\n541\n00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.340\nit's scrambled, what the heck?\n\n542\n00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:32.440\nNo, there's a pattern in there when\nit goes through an algorithm, but\n\n543\n00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.390\nthe pattern,\n\n544\n00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:38.550\nif the algorithm's done correctly is\nindiscernible without a lot of effort.\n\n545\n00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:44.650\nBut encryption is just the process\nof converting unencrypted to\n\n546\n00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.510\nencrypted data or converted data.\n\n547\n00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:48.260\n>> All right.\n\n548\n00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.465\n>> And\nthen decryption just reverses the process.\n\n549\n00:32:51.465 --> 00:32:54.743\nIt's applying the same process,\nbut in reverse,\n\n550\n00:32:54.743 --> 00:33:00.320\nto extract it out of that encrypted format\nand give back the unencrypted information.\n\n551\n00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.390\n>> Okay, and then you got key listed here.\n\n552\n00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:10.080\nYes, key is a very important one, key has\ngot a lot of things revolving around it.\n\n553\n00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:14.030\nSo we really kind of gotta [LAUGH] make\nsure we've got this one down because\n\n554\n00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:17.290\nthere's a lot of potential\nthings that could happen here.\n\n555\n00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.829\nSo let's-\n>> Skip that one,\n\n556\n00:33:19.829 --> 00:33:21.200\nwe can come back to that one in a minute.\n\n557\n00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.160\n>> Yeah, that's why I'm not covering it.\n\n558\n00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.267\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's the elite membership,\n\n559\n00:33:24.267 --> 00:33:25.780\nyou wanna find out what that means.\n\n560\n00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.325\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think probably a good place to start\n\n561\n00:33:28.325 --> 00:33:30.990\nhere is let's do the terms,\nplaintext and ciphertext.\n\n562\n00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.496\nBecause that really would\nhelp us define encryption and\n\n563\n00:33:33.496 --> 00:33:35.540\ndecryption as well, I think.\n\n564\n00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.581\n>> You know, that's a good idea,\nlet's do talk about that.\n\n565\n00:33:39.581 --> 00:33:40.372\n>> All right.\n\n566\n00:33:40.372 --> 00:33:43.920\n>> There's the term plaintext and\nciphertext.\n\n567\n00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.690\nPlaintext, I've been kinda dancing\naround it a bit, but I said unencrypted.\n\n568\n00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.040\nUnencrypted information is\nsomething that's called plaintext.\n\n569\n00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.740\nIt means that it's just\njust out there in the open.\n\n570\n00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:57.850\n>> Human readable typically.\n\n571\n00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.285\nI don't need anything to read it other\nthan understanding the language it's\n\n572\n00:34:00.285 --> 00:34:01.590\nwritten in maybe but-\n>> Or it could be, yeah,\n\n573\n00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:06.020\nit's just it's plain-\n>> It wouldn't have to be, text, right?\n\n574\n00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:11.890\n>> Yes, there's a good footnote to that,\nis that it doesn't have to be text.\n\n575\n00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:16.710\nThis term goes back quite a ways when\nwe were talking about all that stuff,\n\n576\n00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:20.490\nhistorically, of encrypting and\ncoding messages.\n\n577\n00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:25.922\nNow we talk about binary stuff and\nall that, but we still call it plaintext.\n\n578\n00:34:25.922 --> 00:34:31.105\nSo plaintext,\nthe way I jokingly refer to it is,\n\n579\n00:34:31.105 --> 00:34:35.295\nplaintext is anything that you have\nbefore it goes through the meat grinder,\n\n580\n00:34:35.295 --> 00:34:37.810\nbeing an algorithm, being transformed.\n\n581\n00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.020\nDepending on where you step in,\nin the process.\n\n582\n00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.300\nIf you're taking a piece of information\nand sending it through several different\n\n583\n00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:50.950\nencryption algorithms, it's gonna at\nsome point, the plaintext that's at\n\n584\n00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:54.510\nthe beginning is gonna be different from\nthe plaintext goes to the next algorithm.\n\n585\n00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:58.020\nThat's why I say it's,\nthe plaintext is what you have before\n\n586\n00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.220\nit goes in the algorithm,\nno matter what it is.\n\n587\n00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.380\nIt maybe be human readable,\nbut then again it may not.\n\n588\n00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.070\nHeck, I don't even have to introduce\nother algorithms, I could just have\n\n589\n00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:11.160\none algorithm and you feed in something on\none side and it comes out the other side.\n\n590\n00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:16.092\nThis could be binary over here, that's not\nsomething that you can readily read, but\n\n591\n00:35:16.092 --> 00:35:20.700\nit's something that a program can consume,\nthis is consumable information.\n\n592\n00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.590\nSo that's what that is.\n\n593\n00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:30.120\nBut then ciphertext is its counterpart,\nthat's what gets spit out the back end.\n\n594\n00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:34.000\nThat's what comes out after everything\nhas been through the transformation\n\n595\n00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.500\nprocess and all that.\n\n596\n00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:40.330\nThat is boom, here is your end result.\n\n597\n00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:44.050\nAnd that's the one that's had all these\nrules applied to it to change it.\n\n598\n00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:48.620\nSo someone that doesn't have\nthe proper clearance and\n\n599\n00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:51.100\nthe right requirements cannot read it.\n\n600\n00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:55.040\nThey just see a bundle of whatever,\nthat's it.\n\n601\n00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.070\nAnd by the way, it is worth mentioning\nthat sometimes with a plaintext,\n\n602\n00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.900\nthe other term you'll hear is cleartext.\n\n603\n00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.710\nYou will hear that, it's the same thing.\n\n604\n00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:10.410\nIt's just that someone decided,\nhey, plain and clear.\n\n605\n00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:14.590\nI don't know if that's a case of,\nthey use that on one side of the pond and\n\n606\n00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.500\nwe use it over here, or what have you.\n\n607\n00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.130\nBut those two terms\nare synonymous with one another.\n\n608\n00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:25.970\nJust like, it's very rare, but\nyou occasionally hear the term with\n\n609\n00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:29.460\nciphertext, you also\nhear the term cryptotext.\n\n610\n00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.500\nThat's just a really kind\nof clunky term to use,\n\n611\n00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.570\nso it's kind of fallen into disuse.\n\n612\n00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:37.820\n>> Right.\n>> But now and\n\n613\n00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:42.600\nthen you'll see some old textbooks and\nwhite papers and\n\n614\n00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.890\nresearch papers that have been\ndone that still include that term.\n\n615\n00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:46.980\nSo that's what that means, but\n\n616\n00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.080\ndon't expect to really see\nthat in any major use.\n\n617\n00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:56.350\nYou're more likely to see cleartext\nthan you are ever to see cryptotext.\n\n618\n00:36:56.350 --> 00:37:00.570\n>> So our plaintext is then is our input,\nwhat we're starting with.\n\n619\n00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:02.530\nAnd that could be anything,\ndoesn't have to be just text.\n\n620\n00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.680\nIt's just a term we use cuz\nit was developed a while ago.\n\n621\n00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.530\nAnd then we've got our algorithm which is\nwhat we're feeding this plaintext into.\n\n622\n00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:12.760\nAnd then we've got our ciphertext,\n\n623\n00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:17.550\nwhich is the output of feeding that\nplaintext through that algorithm.\n\n624\n00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:21.080\n>> Yes and remember,\nwhich one you start the process with\n\n625\n00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:25.250\ndepends on what the process that\nyou're actually trying to attempt is.\n\n626\n00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.610\n>> True, so what I just described\nthen was the encryption process.\n\n627\n00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:32.560\n>> Yes.\n>> Taking my plaintext,\n\n628\n00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.530\nfeeding it into the algorithm and\nthen outputting my ciphertext.\n\n629\n00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:39.880\nAnd then if we wanted to define decryption\nagain now that we know these terms,\n\n630\n00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.840\nwe can say decryption is\nstarting with the ciphertext,\n\n631\n00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:47.050\nfeeding it through an algorithm,\nand outputting plaintext then.\n\n632\n00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:51.460\n>> Yeah, exactly, so remember it's\njust what comes in on one end, or\n\n633\n00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:56.660\nwhat you start the process with depends\non which way you're trying to go.\n\n634\n00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:02.160\nIf it's encryption or decryption is\ngonna dictate whether it's plaintext or\n\n635\n00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.790\nciphertext, that's it.\n\n636\n00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:11.160\nBut whatever comes in and\ngets converted to an encrypted format,\n\n637\n00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.795\nwhatever comes in,\nthat's plaintext, doesn't matter.\n\n638\n00:38:13.795 --> 00:38:18.235\nIf it's going the other way,\ncoming in as encrypted,\n\n639\n00:38:18.235 --> 00:38:24.905\nit's gonna be decrypted the other way,\nand so that's ciphertext to plaintext.\n\n640\n00:38:24.905 --> 00:38:30.595\nSo do remember that, it's simple, but just\nto make sure that yeah, we've got that.\n\n641\n00:38:30.595 --> 00:38:35.350\nAnd no matter what algorithm you talk\nabout, you're gonna use those terms.\n\n642\n00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:40.820\nThere is some variation on the algorithms,\nto be sure, but what comes in and\n\n643\n00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:45.870\nwhat goes out are still gonna be\ncalled plaintext and ciphertext.\n\n644\n00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:50.731\nThe ones that will kind of see some\nvariation in here is that it's\n\n645\n00:38:50.731 --> 00:38:55.700\nnot always an encryption, and\nthen the reverse is a decryption.\n\n646\n00:38:55.700 --> 00:39:00.320\nCuz some algorithms don't do that,\nthey only do encryption.\n\n647\n00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:05.330\nAnd we've yet to encounter any of those,\nof course, but they do exist.\n\n648\n00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:10.280\n>> Mm-hm, all right, and now let's try to\nexplain the key a little bit there now\n\n649\n00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.470\nthat we've got those terms down.\n\n650\n00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.250\nOr do you want to wait on\nthat one a little more?\n\n651\n00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:18.856\n>> Well this is now is a good time to\nactually talk about the keys since I think\n\n652\n00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:23.232\nwe've got a lot of stuff in the mix\nhere to talk about what a key is, and\n\n653\n00:39:23.232 --> 00:39:24.160\nrelate to it.\n\n654\n00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.163\nA key is a really,\nlike a combination to a lock,\n\n655\n00:39:28.163 --> 00:39:31.745\nif you want to put it in those terms.\n\n656\n00:39:31.745 --> 00:39:37.315\nSo if you go back and use our Caesar\ncipher again as our template or\n\n657\n00:39:37.315 --> 00:39:42.391\nblueprint, if you will,\non how an algorithm works, or\n\n658\n00:39:42.391 --> 00:39:48.562\njust our sample system, we have what we\nneed there to really grasp what a key is.\n\n659\n00:39:48.562 --> 00:39:52.135\nIn fact, I was talking around\nthe point of what a key was,\n\n660\n00:39:52.135 --> 00:39:56.629\nwhen I was discussing what the Caesar\ncipher was just a few moments ago.\n\n661\n00:39:56.629 --> 00:39:58.911\nIf you look at the Caesar\ncipher we talked about,\n\n662\n00:39:58.911 --> 00:40:02.706\nplaintext plus a value\nequals your ciphertext.\n\n663\n00:40:02.706 --> 00:40:07.188\nNow that we have those terms in our\nvocabulary, that's what's happening.\n\n664\n00:40:07.188 --> 00:40:10.607\nPlaintext plus something\nequals ciphertext.\n\n665\n00:40:10.607 --> 00:40:13.668\nAnd then I told you on top that algorithm,\n\n666\n00:40:13.668 --> 00:40:18.656\nif we're using the English alphabet,\nyou've got 26 letters and\n\n667\n00:40:18.656 --> 00:40:23.380\nthen we add 0 to that because you\ncan have that value out there and\n\n668\n00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:29.157\nwe're talking Keys, because what's\ngoing to happen here one through 26,\n\n669\n00:40:29.157 --> 00:40:33.210\nI can add one through 26 to\nany value in the alphabet.\n\n670\n00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.180\nAnd then,\nyou could also just do nothing at all.\n\n671\n00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.370\nThat's possible,\nthat's where the zero comes in.\n\n672\n00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:44.640\nThere's obviously no letter zero in\nthe alphabet, there's nothing before A.\n\n673\n00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:49.200\nSo we can't have that, but\nwe can have a zero on the combination.\n\n674\n00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:54.460\nSo what that means is that\nwe've got 27 possible keys.\n\n675\n00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.120\nYou can put in that plaintext plus\nsomething equals cipher text.\n\n676\n00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.386\nThat something can be any number\nfrom 0 all the way to 26.\n\n677\n00:41:03.386 --> 00:41:07.680\nYou can add that on your plain\ntext to get that cipher text.\n\n678\n00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.590\nSo that key tells you how encryption or\n\n679\n00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:16.130\nwhat combination's gonna be used on\nencryption at that point in time.\n\n680\n00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:20.400\nAnd good algorithms will\ndefine a lot of keys.\n\n681\n00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.750\nObviously if we're talking the Caesar\ncypher with the English alphabet,\n\n682\n00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.530\n27 possible keys.\n\n683\n00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:29.150\nSo you've got 0-26 to choose from.\n\n684\n00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:33.400\nSomeone sends you something that's been\nencrypted using the Caesar cypher,\n\n685\n00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.620\nyou can figure that out pretty easily.\n\n686\n00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:42.060\nAll you have to do is do\na brute force attack and\n\n687\n00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.700\nyou can do that using your, like,\nCaptain Crunch decoder ring if you want.\n\n688\n00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.400\nI mean that's a very simple thing.\n\n689\n00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.720\nYou could just go ahead and\ntake a section of that message and\n\n690\n00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:55.970\ntry different combinations to operate it\nuntil you get a word that's readable.\n\n691\n00:41:55.970 --> 00:42:00.810\nAnd then apply that key across the whole\nthing and to reveal that message.\n\n692\n00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:04.750\nIt's kind of why the Caesar Cypher, by the\nway, with only 27 possible keys in this\n\n693\n00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:10.460\nexample, it's one of the reasons why it's\nnot something that would be used in its\n\n694\n00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.090\nraw form like that for anything serious\nbecause it's just too easy to break.\n\n695\n00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:17.840\nYou wanna do that in your breakfast\ncereal or in your puzzle books or\n\n696\n00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.510\nsomething, hey, go for it.\n\n697\n00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:24.010\nDo whatever you want there,\nbut beyond that,\n\n698\n00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:29.560\nit wouldn't be usable in any type of\nserious capacity just on it's own.\n\n699\n00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:34.460\nIt's also why they\ninvented the Vinye cypher,\n\n700\n00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.660\nthat's something he attempted for\nthe puzzle.\n\n701\n00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.180\nIt's one of the reasons why that was so\nstrong.\n\n702\n00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.400\nThat's actually if you break it down.\n\n703\n00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.540\nThat's actually multiple\nCaesar cyphers playing.\n\n704\n00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:50.110\nBecause we're picking that key word and\nthen encrypting and\n\n705\n00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:52.110\ndoing all the rotations to the alphabet.\n\n706\n00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:54.430\nIf you look at it,\nall those pseudo alphabets or\n\n707\n00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:57.000\ncrypto alphabets,\nthey're just different key shifts.\n\n708\n00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.850\nSo you're just doing\nmultiple Caesar ciphers and\n\n709\n00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:01.820\nadding on this rotating Key to it.\n\n710\n00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:08.270\nSo that's kind of exploring just some of\nthe different implementation of keys.\n\n711\n00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:13.170\nNow how you choose a key, and\nhow many different values for\n\n712\n00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:16.120\na key you can have,\ndepends on the algorithm itself.\n\n713\n00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:21.570\nAnd keys are almost\nalways defined in bits.\n\n714\n00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:28.400\nEvery bit you add on to a key\nmakes it that much stronger.\n\n715\n00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.630\nAnd that's an important notion.\n\n716\n00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:34.590\nIf you're talking, we'll just talk about\na key in terms of ones and zeroes.\n\n717\n00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:40.690\nSo if you have just a single\nbit representing a key.\n\n718\n00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:42.320\nThat means there's two possible values.\n\n719\n00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.170\nBut then you'd put in a second one,\na second bit, now what do you have?\n\n720\n00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:48.010\nYou've got four possible values.\n\n721\n00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:50.200\nAnd then a third one, and that's eight.\n\n722\n00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.830\nAnd it's gonna keep doing that and\ndoubling in strength\n\n723\n00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:56.920\nevery time you add another bit to it,\njust with the binary one.\n\n724\n00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.860\nIf you start going into\nother base numbering systems\n\n725\n00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:04.970\nthen it's gonna increase even more\nthan that every bit you add on.\n\n726\n00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:09.230\nAnd so that's a substantial thing to\nunderstand because when you look at,\n\n727\n00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:13.270\noh this is a 64 bit key,\nand this is a 128 bit key.\n\n728\n00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.320\nWhy use this when I've got this,\nit doesn't make sense.\n\n729\n00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.050\nWell, that's a longer one.\n\n730\n00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:22.920\nIt adds a certain level\nof strength to that key.\n\n731\n00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:27.640\nI also wanna throw in to this, too that\njust because you have a key that's\n\n732\n00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:33.330\n128 bits, lets say, doesn't\nnecessarily mean it's always stronger.\n\n733\n00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:38.370\nOkay, I can design an algorithm\nthat's utter crap and\n\n734\n00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:42.760\njust really screw you over by saying,\nokay, this is my encryption algorithm.\n\n735\n00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.740\nAll the keys that are generated in it,\nthey're gonna be, and\n\n736\n00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:52.370\nI'm just use it as an example,\nthey can't contain any numbers, no\n\n737\n00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:57.320\nspecial characters, and they're all gonna\nbe numbers from the English alphabet and\n\n738\n00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.160\nthey all have to be uppercase letters.\n\n739\n00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.680\nBut, it's gonna to be 128 characters long.\n\n740\n00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.180\nOh, goody.\n\n741\n00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:10.080\nBecause you've just eliminated\na lot of stuff from the equation.\n\n742\n00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:15.680\nAnd by doing that you've severely\nlimited the number of keys and\n\n743\n00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.745\nthat makes it easier to search.\n\n744\n00:45:17.745 --> 00:45:21.560\nCuz someone wants to do\nan exhaustive key search,\n\n745\n00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.870\nwhich also can be called\na brute force attack.\n\n746\n00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:27.180\nIf they wanted to do that to retrieve\nthe correct key, it's easier.\n\n747\n00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:31.440\nYou've just made the pool smaller by\nputting those restrictions on it.\n\n748\n00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.740\nSo longer doesn't always mean\nyou have a stronger key.\n\n749\n00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:40.400\nIt could be a deficiency right in\nthe algorithm itself that says hey,\n\n750\n00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.007\nyou've got a blahbity blah key.\n\n751\n00:45:42.007 --> 00:45:43.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n752\n00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:47.900\nit may be weaker than something\nthat is actually, if it's 128-bit,\n\n753\n00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:52.270\nlet's say, you could have a 64-bit one\nthat's stronger than the 128-bit one.\n\n754\n00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:55.190\nBecause it's been\nartificially handicapped,\n\n755\n00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:58.160\nit may be no better than,\nlet's say, a 20-bit key.\n\n756\n00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.665\nAnd it has happened by the way.\n\n757\n00:46:01.665 --> 00:46:03.165\nIt definitely has happened.\n\n758\n00:46:03.165 --> 00:46:06.697\nThat's why you'll see,\nif you're in the right circles and\n\n759\n00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:10.228\nreally do your research,\nin general IT and stuff like that,\n\n760\n00:46:10.228 --> 00:46:13.781\nthey'll say, oh yeah,\nit's a longer key, it's better.\n\n761\n00:46:13.781 --> 00:46:17.450\nNot necessarily.\n\n762\n00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:21.817\nThat's why when you get out, break out\nof that box of IT and all that and\n\n763\n00:46:21.817 --> 00:46:24.039\nget into the cryptographic world,\n\n764\n00:46:24.039 --> 00:46:27.685\nthey're gonna also add in some\nof these other things too.\n\n765\n00:46:27.685 --> 00:46:30.628\nThat's how you generate that key,\nnot just how long it is.\n\n766\n00:46:30.628 --> 00:46:31.129\n>> Mm-hm and\n\n767\n00:46:31.129 --> 00:46:34.730\nthen that kinda brings us into one more\nterm that we ought to get in here.\n\n768\n00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:37.830\nWhen you talk about limiting\nthe number of possible keys,\n\n769\n00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:41.590\nyou're really reducing that key space,\nright?\n\n770\n00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:44.160\n>> Yes,\nthat is absolutely where this would go,\n\n771\n00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:49.240\nis the keyspace is how many possible\nkeys an algorithm can have.\n\n772\n00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.640\nAn algorithm is going to have some\n\n773\n00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:58.200\nnumber of keys that are available\nto it for you to use.\n\n774\n00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:02.190\nIf you look again at the Caesar cipher,\n27 possible keys.\n\n775\n00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:07.260\nYou've got a key space\nthat's got 27 things in it.\n\n776\n00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.490\nThat's it.\n\n777\n00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:12.310\nSo we know that's not a lot.\n\n778\n00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:16.970\nBut you can get ones that are\nsubstantially bigger by adding on extra\n\n779\n00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:21.970\nbits to it and then having an algorithm\nthat creates a good wide variety of\n\n780\n00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:26.700\nvalues that can be in there with every\nspace and every character in there.\n\n781\n00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:31.070\nYou can have a tremendously\nsized key space that\n\n782\n00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:35.380\nthe human brain can't even get around it,\nit's really tough and it is really tough.\n\n783\n00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:42.034\nI mean the human brain really, I think\nthey said physiologically or mentally or\n\n784\n00:47:42.034 --> 00:47:47.410\nwhatever, that we can only grasp numbers,\nup to about 127.\n\n785\n00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:51.139\nThey said once it gets over that,\nlike 100, 120,\n\n786\n00:47:51.139 --> 00:47:54.954\n127, once it gets over that,\nyou don't have a value.\n\n787\n00:47:54.954 --> 00:47:59.530\nIf I tell you you have $100, you can\nkind of understand what that means,\n\n788\n00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:03.248\nif you were to visualize it,\nyou kind of understand that, but\n\n789\n00:48:03.248 --> 00:48:06.633\nif I told you visualize what\na million dollars looks like\n\n790\n00:48:08.824 --> 00:48:13.681\nYou know what the value's supposed\nto mean but you can't visualize.\n\n791\n00:48:13.681 --> 00:48:18.530\nThe number is just,\nit's really tough to visualize so\n\n792\n00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:24.950\nthat's a part of it but In any case,\nthe way to talk about a key space\n\n793\n00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:28.960\ndifferent from the Caesar cipher.\n\n794\n00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.930\nOne of the examples they use, it's\na common one I used it in the book too,\n\n795\n00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.090\nis for AES.\n\n796\n00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:37.390\nAES, they give you,\n\n797\n00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:41.070\nto give you kind of a somewhat\nvisualization of the number of keys.\n\n798\n00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:45.180\nAnd this is somewhat crude, but\nit is an effective example or\n\n799\n00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.520\nillustration of how many keys you have.\n\n800\n00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:52.895\nIf you looked at AES and you,\nto visualize number keys if\n\n801\n00:48:52.895 --> 00:48:57.355\nyou think of a trench dug from Sacramento\nall the way down to Los Angeles.\n\n802\n00:48:57.355 --> 00:49:00.615\nThat's about 400 some odd miles,\nmaybe 420,\n\n803\n00:49:00.615 --> 00:49:04.525\nor something like that, 420,\n425, somewhere in there.\n\n804\n00:49:05.525 --> 00:49:08.065\nIf you visualize a trench that long.\n\n805\n00:49:08.065 --> 00:49:12.490\nIt's a mile wide and a mile deep, and\nsomewhere along the way you decided\n\n806\n00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:16.660\nwhen you dug that trench that you are\ngoing to fill it full of ping pong balls.\n\n807\n00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:22.980\nAnd when you're doing that, you took one\nof the ping pong balls, painted it red and\n\n808\n00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:26.100\njust threw it in there,\ni'm not watching you.\n\n809\n00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:29.270\nYou just threw it in there while\nyou're filling this thing up.\n\n810\n00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:33.240\nThat red ball would actually\nrepresent the correct key for\n\n811\n00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:36.690\na specific encryption sequence in AS.\n\n812\n00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:41.990\nNow I'm gonna tell you, to brute force it\nand to brute force it in this example.\n\n813\n00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:44.170\nI mean you probably\nimagine that's gonna be.\n\n814\n00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:46.330\nHeck of a lot [LAUGH] of ping pong balls.\n\n815\n00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:50.565\nIf I told you to brute force that,\nI'm telling you, go find the red ball.\n\n816\n00:49:50.565 --> 00:49:51.390\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n817\n00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:55.980\n>> Statistically, you could be the first\none you trip over, or whatever.\n\n818\n00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.370\nSee lying there?\n\n819\n00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:58.440\nCould happen.\n\n820\n00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.770\nMay also be the very last one after\nyou've emptied everything out,\n\n821\n00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:04.500\nit could be the last one in there.\n\n822\n00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:09.005\nBut it's more than likely going to be\nsomewhere in between those two extremes.\n\n823\n00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:10.080\nMm-hm.\n\n824\n00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:13.250\n>> Either case, by the time you find that,\n\n825\n00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:17.450\nit's gonna be a long time if\nyou're doing it by yourself.\n\n826\n00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:20.180\nSo you're that,\nlonely computer sitting there, you know,\n\n827\n00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:23.440\ngoing through these things looking for\nthat one red ball.\n\n828\n00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.630\n>> Right.\n>> That's going to be a very,\n\n829\n00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:26.560\nvery seriously time intensive stuff.\n\n830\n00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.930\nYou're gonna need to pack\nnot just one lunch, but\n\n831\n00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:32.655\na lot of lunches,\nbecause you're going to be there awhile.\n\n832\n00:50:32.655 --> 00:50:35.410\nAES is kinda sorta like that.\n\n833\n00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:37.060\nIt's not the exact number.\n\n834\n00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:40.140\nI guess someone could probably\ncalculate on the numbers I gave you,\n\n835\n00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:44.750\nhow many ping pong balls that would be,\nbut we don't need to do that.\n\n836\n00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:49.190\nWe can just say just by understanding\nthat, that problem there,\n\n837\n00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:50.630\nthat thought experiment.\n\n838\n00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.640\nYou can see that that would be a very,\nvery tough challenge and\n\n839\n00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.435\nthat would be a key space for\n\n840\n00:50:55.435 --> 00:50:59.870\nAES or really any algorithm could\nbe visualized the same way.\n\n841\n00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:01.850\nJust the size of that trench.\n\n842\n00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:03.816\nWhat the pool looks like.\n\n843\n00:51:03.816 --> 00:51:08.210\nSo then, to sum that up,\nour key is really something that's used\n\n844\n00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:12.780\nin conjunction with the algorithm, in\na sense, to make it unique to you, right?\n\n845\n00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:16.590\nBecause if we all used the same algorithm,\nlike Ben in our chat room has been using\n\n846\n00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.920\nCaesar cipher to encrypt and\nthen decrypt his name.\n\n847\n00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:23.860\nAnd if I had the encrypted version\nof the text, the cipher text, and\n\n848\n00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:27.020\nI knew the algorithm that Ben used,\nI didn't know what the plain text was, but\n\n849\n00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:31.240\nI knew the algorithm he used,\nI could simply reverse it and\n\n850\n00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.580\nget the original text back out.\n\n851\n00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:36.510\nBut if Ben uses that algorithm and\n\n852\n00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:41.210\na key along with the algorithm,\nand he keeps that key secret.\n\n853\n00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:43.600\nNow, I don't know what he's doing right?\n\n854\n00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.330\nAnd I've got that cipher text.\n\n855\n00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:46.610\nI won't be able to reverse it.\n\n856\n00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:49.890\nAnd if we each have unique keys,\nwe can all use the same algorithm.\n\n857\n00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:53.140\nYou can't decrypt my stuff,\nI can't decrypt your stuff.\n\n858\n00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:57.680\nSo to make it simple you might\nthink Ben's key might be +5.\n\n859\n00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.740\nSo he's doing cipher,\nwhich is to rotate three letters, but\n\n860\n00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.890\nhis key is plus five, so he's actually\nrotating eight letters not three.\n\n861\n00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:05.760\nI didn't know that.\n\n862\n00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.760\nSean's key might be negative two, so\n\n863\n00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.750\nhe's not rotating three,\nhe's actually only rotating one, right?\n\n864\n00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:12.638\nBut I didn't know that.\n\n865\n00:52:12.638 --> 00:52:16.340\nI knew whatever algorithm he used, but\nI didn't know what his key was that he\n\n866\n00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.310\nplugged into the algorithm,\nso that key really helps.\n\n867\n00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:23.870\nWe can all use the same algorithms,\nbut I can't decrypt your stuff,\n\n868\n00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:25.300\nyou can't decrypt my stuff,\n\n869\n00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.430\nwithout knowing the key that I used\nin conjunction with the algorithm.\n\n870\n00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:32.650\nAnd then the key space is\nthe total number of possible keys.\n\n871\n00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:34.820\nExactly.\n>> You can use with that algorithm.\n\n872\n00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:37.240\nThe bigger the key space is,\n\n873\n00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:41.220\nthen the more difficult it's going\nto be to guess what key you used.\n\n874\n00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.940\nAnd Sean was saying if it was binary and\n\n875\n00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.755\nit was ony two bit key,\nthere's only four possibilities.\n\n876\n00:52:45.755 --> 00:52:49.910\n0-1-2-3.\nSo I've gone through all four and\n\n877\n00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:52.560\none of them's gotta be your key.\n\n878\n00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:56.880\nBut if that key was 256 bits, that's\ngonna be a lot tougher for me to guess.\n\n879\n00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.970\nSo the bigger the key space,\nthe more possible keys,\n\n880\n00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:03.580\nthe more difficult which is really\nwhat's making that algorithm stronger.\n\n881\n00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.030\nThe bigger the key space,\nthe stronger the algorithm.\n\n882\n00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:09.690\nYeah, the more mathematics you put in,\nthe more ways you transform it and\n\n883\n00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:12.880\nall that you get a longer and longer key.\n\n884\n00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.910\nWhich is, all other things considered,\nis part of it.\n\n885\n00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:18.680\nIt's gonna give you a much stronger key.\n\n886\n00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.950\nAnd also remember,\n\n887\n00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:23.370\nit doesn't have to be a key that's\ntied to a specific person either.\n\n888\n00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:27.820\nI mean, what you were saying Mike,\nthat is one of the ways that they do it.\n\n889\n00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:33.250\nThat would be an example close to what\nthey use for public private key stuff,\n\n890\n00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:37.190\nis that when they assign one to somebody,\nit doesn't have to be that way.\n\n891\n00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:38.370\nWe can use for\n\n892\n00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:42.900\nexample one of the applications\nwe'll talk about later on is SSL.\n\n893\n00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.760\nSSL using something called a session key.\n\n894\n00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.680\nThat session key isn't\nassigned to an individual.\n\n895\n00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.430\nIt's assigned to that session.\n\n896\n00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:54.810\nAnd so it's used for that session and\nthen it is returned back to the pool.\n\n897\n00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:56.710\nAnd that's the other thing to remember.\n\n898\n00:53:56.710 --> 00:54:00.990\nIf you pluck a key out of the key space,\nyou use it.\n\n899\n00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:04.270\nIt doesn't mean that when you are done\nusing it it gets flung over your shoulder\n\n900\n00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.040\nand disappears into the ether.\n\n901\n00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.830\nIt actually does get reused.\n\n902\n00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:09.780\nIt can be reused at any time.\n\n903\n00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:15.560\nBut if you have a large enough key space,\nor that trench that we were talking about.\n\n904\n00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:19.640\nThe chances of you grabbing\na ping pong ball and saying hey,\n\n905\n00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.490\nthis is the one I'm\ngoing to use this time.\n\n906\n00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:24.900\nAnd you can do your operation, and\nthen decrypt it and all that, and\n\n907\n00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:26.370\nthen fling it over your shoulder.\n\n908\n00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:32.390\nThe chances of you reaching over your\nshoulder and grabbing that same ball again\n\n909\n00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:37.235\nare quite low, statistically\nit's just not going to happen.\n\n910\n00:54:37.235 --> 00:54:37.740\nMm-hm.\n\n911\n00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:43.600\n>> So that's the power of something like\nSSL or TLS, is they'll use something like\n\n912\n00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:49.700\nAES or Triple DES or something like that\nto give you this broad, broad key space.\n\n913\n00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:53.760\nAnd I know we're kinda,\nwe're running short on time here,\n\n914\n00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:57.590\nbut we should mention because we're\nright in the same zip code with it.\n\n915\n00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:01.440\nIs Karcoff's principle,\nthis is significant and\n\n916\n00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:04.760\nso it just kinda wrap all\nthese things together\n\n917\n00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:10.040\nas Karcoff's principle is\nan important thing to really grasp.\n\n918\n00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:14.530\nYou were talking about the relationship\nbetween keys, and algorithms,\n\n919\n00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:18.710\ndifferent people and\nstuff that is an important, that's a very,\n\n920\n00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:22.910\nvery important detail because it\nrelates to this Karcoff's principle.\n\n921\n00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:26.540\nYou know, if you think of an algorithm in,\nfor, in, in the same,\n\n922\n00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:29.380\nthe same ways you would think\nof a blue print for a lock?\n\n923\n00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.820\nYou know, you're, it helps you,\nit helps you a lot because.\n\n924\n00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:37.090\nThink of if you went down to, like, Target\nor Sears or, whatever, a hardware store or\n\n925\n00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:40.230\nwhatever and\nyou grabbed a combination lock.\n\n926\n00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:41.100\nYou know off the shelf.\n\n927\n00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:45.130\nWhatever one, you know just like you\nwould at any store just grab one and\n\n928\n00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:47.970\nsay I need a combination lock for\nthe gym or whatever.\n\n929\n00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:52.590\nYou get that combination lock and\nit's going to have a,\n\n930\n00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:54.910\nhopefully, unique combination with it.\n\n931\n00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:57.940\nSo you've got a unique combination.\n\n932\n00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:01.930\nNow all the other ones are gonna have\na unique combination that were on that\n\n933\n00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:02.950\nshelf too.\n\n934\n00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:06.713\nOr one that you could\nset in certain cases.\n\n935\n00:56:06.713 --> 00:56:10.899\nSo we'll say you set your own combination,\nyou get a blank lock,\n\n936\n00:56:10.899 --> 00:56:12.890\nyou set your own combination.\n\n937\n00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:14.055\nBoom, there And there you go.\n\n938\n00:56:14.055 --> 00:56:19.231\nNow what happens with that is once\nyou set your own key or combination,\n\n939\n00:56:19.231 --> 00:56:23.830\nas we're calling it in this case,\nyou set that, that's it.\n\n940\n00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:25.080\nThat's yours.\n\n941\n00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:28.830\nThat's the one that you set,\nyou chose out of that combination because\n\n942\n00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:31.490\nthose tumblers in that lock, or\nI shouldn't say tumblers, but\n\n943\n00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:35.570\nthose numbers that they had in the lock,\nthey can only be set to so many positions.\n\n944\n00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:36.680\nSo they told you the rules.\n\n945\n00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.920\nThose wheels are specific rules.\n\n946\n00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.750\nIt's zero through nine on\nevery one of them, we'll say.\n\n947\n00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:44.520\nSo they're telling you, hey you've got\nto choose five of those digits and\n\n948\n00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:47.350\nevery digit has to be some\nnumber between zero and nine.\n\n949\n00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:49.550\nI don't care what they are,\nbut that's the rules.\n\n950\n00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:55.020\nSo you choose a key and\nout of that, that becomes yours.\n\n951\n00:56:55.020 --> 00:57:02.470\nNow sounds great, hey, I've got\na specific key for it, okay, great.\n\n952\n00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:04.855\nBut if someone else knew the blueprint or\n\n953\n00:57:04.855 --> 00:57:08.652\nthe lock it would stand a reason\nthat they could figure that out.\n\n954\n00:57:08.652 --> 00:57:10.788\nCould is the operative word here.\n\n955\n00:57:10.788 --> 00:57:12.889\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They could figure it out.\n\n956\n00:57:12.889 --> 00:57:15.818\nBut if you look at it in terms of a lock,\n\n957\n00:57:15.818 --> 00:57:20.304\nif I look at a blueprint of that\nspecific model of lock, and\n\n958\n00:57:20.304 --> 00:57:25.248\ngo to that store or any other store\nthat sells that brand of lock,\n\n959\n00:57:25.248 --> 00:57:30.651\nit does not tell me in any of those\ncases if someone bought those locks,\n\n960\n00:57:30.651 --> 00:57:33.440\nwhat combination they're using.\n\n961\n00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.260\nIt only tells me what range\nof values are possible.\n\n962\n00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:40.860\nKerckhoff's principle says that if you\ndevelop a new cryptographic algorithm,\n\n963\n00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:44.000\nyou can put it out there in\nthe public space, and open it up for\n\n964\n00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.890\npublic review and scrutiny so\nthey can improve it and tweak it.\n\n965\n00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:50.930\nSo that's a great thing so they can\nsee if there's any issues with it.\n\n966\n00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:55.040\nBut it also dictates that the power and\n\n967\n00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:00.050\nstrength of an algorithm does not rely on\nthe secrecy of the algorithm, it relies\n\n968\n00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:05.330\non the secrecy of the key, itself, so\nthat's an important relationship there.\n\n969\n00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:06.912\nAnd that's what you were\nsaying Mike is that-\n\n970\n00:58:06.912 --> 00:58:08.033\n>> Yeah, cuz there's only so\n\n971\n00:58:08.033 --> 00:58:10.130\nmany algorithms that we\nuse in the computer world,\n\n972\n00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:12.325\nI mean they're coming up\nwith new ones all the time.\n\n973\n00:58:12.325 --> 00:58:15.850\nBut we all use the same ones, and it would\nmake sense if we're all using the same\n\n974\n00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:19.010\nalgorithm, that I could be able to decrypt\nyour stuff and you could decrypt mine.\n\n975\n00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:22.629\nAnd that's where that key comes in and\nkeeps it safe.\n\n976\n00:58:22.629 --> 00:58:25.140\nBut the key as you said, yeah,\nit has to be kept secret.\n\n977\n00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:27.320\n>> Yeah,\nit's essential that you have that.\n\n978\n00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:30.379\nOnce you've got possession of the key,\n\n979\n00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:35.695\nwho the hell cares what we know\nabout busting the algorithm.\n\n980\n00:58:35.695 --> 00:58:38.600\nI just grab that same\nalgorithm off the shelf and\n\n981\n00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:41.370\nshove stuff through it with\nthat combination, I'm done.\n\n982\n00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:44.000\nI don't have to reverse engineer anything.\n\n983\n00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.420\nBut if you've got the algorithm but\nno key, now what've you gotta do?\n\n984\n00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:49.850\nWell, how did they generate a key?\n\n985\n00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:51.030\nWhat's the range of values?\n\n986\n00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:54.790\nNow let's apply everything in that\nrange of values to that specific\n\n987\n00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:56.920\nciphertext to see if we can break it.\n\n988\n00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:00.650\nIt's gonna be quite exhaustive,\nas they say,\n\n989\n00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:02.800\nit'd be quite exhaustive to break that.\n\n990\n00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:06.790\nSo that's what Kerckhoffs's\nprinciple defines.\n\n991\n00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:08.680\nPut the algorithm out there,\n\n992\n00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:13.640\nbut you don't tell people what your\nspecific key is at any point in time\n\n993\n00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:17.800\nbecause then the whole power of\nthe system has just gone out the window.\n\n994\n00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:21.775\nKerckhoff's principle is a guideline,\nnot a rule.\n\n995\n00:59:21.775 --> 00:59:25.784\nThere's nobody out there that's\nmaking algorithms that has to submit\n\n996\n00:59:25.784 --> 00:59:28.230\nthem to a regulating body.\n\n997\n00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:29.800\nNSA, for example, here in the States,\n\n998\n00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.170\nmakes cryptographic\nalgorithms all the time.\n\n999\n00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:33.802\nThey never tell anybody about it.\n\n1000\n00:59:33.802 --> 00:59:36.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's just not part of their policy.\n\n1001\n00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:38.220\nIn fact, they've had a couple cases\nwhere other countries have come up\n\n1002\n00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:40.865\nwith algorithms and they've said, yeah,\nwe thought about that ten years ago.\n\n1003\n00:59:40.865 --> 00:59:43.292\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They don't publicize them.\n\n1004\n00:59:43.292 --> 00:59:45.650\n>> All right, well looking at our clock,\nwe went a little bit long there.\n\n1005\n00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:47.090\nBut we had some good information in.\n\n1006\n00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:48.590\nWe're gonna take another\none of those breaks.\n\n1007\n00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:53.251\nWhen we come back we're going to continue\non with The Language of Cryptography, so\n\n1008\n00:59:53.251 --> 00:59:53.996\nstay tuned.\n\n1009\n00:59:53.996 --> 00:59:56.020\nWe'll be right back.\n\n1010\n00:59:56.020 --> 01:00:03.413\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1011\n01:00:03.413 --> 01:00:05.777\nSo, continuing on with our\nLanguage of Cryptography,\n\n1012\n01:00:05.777 --> 01:00:07.830\nwe got a few more terms\nwe need to go over, Sean.\n\n1013\n01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:12.210\nI think, I don't know where we want\nto go next on our list of terms here.\n\n1014\n01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:13.230\nI'll let you decide.\n\n1015\n01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:14.770\nWhere do you want to go?\n\n1016\n01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:17.550\n>> We got plenty of places to go.\n\n1017\n01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:23.360\nOne of the ones, we'll just start off with\none of the ones on here, work factor.\n\n1018\n01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:27.160\nI think that's kind of\nan important thing to talk\n\n1019\n01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:31.370\nabout cuz it is going to come into\nplay when we go through this.\n\n1020\n01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:34.500\nA work factor kind of\ndescribes the effort and\n\n1021\n01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:39.290\ntime it takes to actually do\nthe cryptographic process.\n\n1022\n01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:43.890\nWe are looking at several different\ncryptographic techniques during\n\n1023\n01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:49.380\nthe course of our exploration here,\nand there's\n\n1024\n01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:53.450\none place where we can kind of look at\nthis and see where work factor comes in.\n\n1025\n01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:56.870\nIt would be in the symmetric\nversus asymmetric world.\n\n1026\n01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:03.110\nAsymmetric has a higher work factor than\nthe symmetric stuff does just because of\n\n1027\n01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:07.490\nthe different mathematics and\npower that's in place there.\n\n1028\n01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:11.400\nAsymmetrical requires higher order\nmathematics and stuff like that to gain\n\n1029\n01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:16.290\nthe relationships and all that in there\ncorrectly, where symmetric does not.\n\n1030\n01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:19.710\nSymmetric is a lot simpler to do.\n\n1031\n01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:24.820\nSo, therefore, symmetric has a lower work\nfactor, which also translates to the fact\n\n1032\n01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:29.580\nthat since there's a lower work factor,\nless work to be done, it goes faster, it's\n\n1033\n01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:33.910\nmore efficient, especially when you're\ntalking about large volumes of data.\n\n1034\n01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:37.592\nNow, when you talk about a higher\nwork factor like you would have with\n\n1035\n01:01:37.592 --> 01:01:42.220\nsomething like asymmetric, it means\nthat you're gonna have more work to do.\n\n1036\n01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:47.200\nHence, it's gonna take longer to process\ninformation, which you'll really notice,\n\n1037\n01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.240\nagain, on large volumes, or\nwhat they call, bulk data.\n\n1038\n01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.900\nSo there is a difference\nbetween those two,\n\n1039\n01:01:53.900 --> 01:02:00.180\nbetween having a high work factor and\na low work factor.\n\n1040\n01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:04.850\nIt tells you just how much is gonna be,\nand what's being done, or\n\n1041\n01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:08.430\nhow much number crunching is\nbeing done with the system.\n\n1042\n01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:09.027\nIn fact, code breaking comes\ndown to that in some cases.\n\n1043\n01:02:09.027 --> 01:02:13.828\nCode-breaking, you can actually\nin some cases time how\n\n1044\n01:02:13.828 --> 01:02:18.229\nlong it takes to process\na piece of information, and\n\n1045\n01:02:18.229 --> 01:02:23.480\ntake a guess as to what type of\nsystem is underneath the hood.\n\n1046\n01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.070\nSo you may have a black box, and\n\n1047\n01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:29.980\nnot know what that algorithm is inside of\nit, whether it's symmetric or asymmetric.\n\n1048\n01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:36.610\nYou could take a volume of data and shove\nit through there and you can see, kind of\n\n1049\n01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:40.270\nmake an estimate if you've got they type\nof brain to do the mathematics, figure out\n\n1050\n01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:44.840\nhow long it would take to process\nthat on symmetric versus asymmetric,\n\n1051\n01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.650\nand if you see a dramatic difference or\nyou see how long it's taking,\n\n1052\n01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:53.295\nyou can start honing in on\nwhich one it actually is.\n\n1053\n01:02:53.295 --> 01:02:55.760\nIt's really fascinating\nwhen you think about that,\n\n1054\n01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.360\nthat you can just see how long it\ntakes to go from point A to point B.\n\n1055\n01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.000\nThrough the algorithm,\n\n1056\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.160\nyou can tell which one it actually\nis without actually seeing it.\n\n1057\n01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.150\n>> And we'll come back and\ndefine those symmetric and\n\n1058\n01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:08.750\nasymmetric, I know we\nhaven't hit those yet.\n\n1059\n01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.365\nAnd another good example I\nthought of is WEP, right?.\n\n1060\n01:03:11.365 --> 01:03:14.660\nI mean, I remember when we had\nour wireless access points and\n\n1061\n01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:15.940\nthey supported WEP.\n\n1062\n01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:20.291\nThen they came out with WPA to kinda\nimprove a little on WEP because it\n\n1063\n01:03:20.291 --> 01:03:20.960\nwas insecure.\n\n1064\n01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.380\nAnd then they came out with WPA2, and\n\n1065\n01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.760\nthey changed the algorithms\nalong the lines there.\n\n1066\n01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.070\nAnd all of a sudden where\nit's going from WEP to WPA,\n\n1067\n01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:31.040\nI could do a firmware\nupgrade on my access point.\n\n1068\n01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:36.680\nBut when we went to WPA2, better\nalgorithm, an algorithm that was much more\n\n1069\n01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:41.170\nwork intensive, or had more work factor,\nI couldn't do just a firmware upgrade.\n\n1070\n01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:44.400\nI had to upgrade the router, itself,\ncuz it needed a better processor\n\n1071\n01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.820\nto be able to handle that algorithm\nthat had a higher work factor.\n\n1072\n01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:51.100\nSo work factor, and\nthat's just in the computer world.\n\n1073\n01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.530\nSame thing if you're doing it manually,\nor what have you,\n\n1074\n01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:58.020\nbut work factor is how much effort\nit takes to process that algorithm.\n\n1075\n01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:02.782\n>> Yeah, that's actually a really\ngood example precisely because those\n\n1076\n01:04:02.782 --> 01:04:06.987\ndifferent WEP, WPA, WPA2,\nall use different algorithms,\n\n1077\n01:04:06.987 --> 01:04:10.176\nimplementing them\ndifferently on top of that.\n\n1078\n01:04:10.176 --> 01:04:15.640\nYou had a processor internally,\nthat thing that would be able to support\n\n1079\n01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:20.578\nthings To a point, and\nthen after that it just wouldn't happen.\n\n1080\n01:04:20.578 --> 01:04:23.225\nYou couldn't do an upgrade\nto some of these things,\n\n1081\n01:04:23.225 --> 01:04:25.040\nthere wasn't enough power there.\n\n1082\n01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:29.087\nSo if you go through an old enough router,\nit is possible that you may not even\n\n1083\n01:04:29.087 --> 01:04:33.400\nget past WEP, because there's just not\nenough oomph behind that to even do WPA.\n\n1084\n01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:38.100\nSo they'll basically have to trash that\nrouter and go to one of the newer ones,\n\n1085\n01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:44.700\nwhich is why we say things like\nethical hacking and the Security +,\n\n1086\n01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:50.920\nall those ones you'll typically hear\nit said, you go to WEP if possible.\n\n1087\n01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.670\nYou know,\nbecause it's not always possible.\n\n1088\n01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:57.970\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly, all right, and then\nanother term, we've talked about keys.\n\n1089\n01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:02.150\nAnd again, I know we haven't really talked\nabout asymmetric and symmetric yet,\n\n1090\n01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:06.900\nbut we probably at this point\nhave an idea that somehow both\n\n1091\n01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:11.280\nends are gonna need a key to do\nthis encryption and decryption.\n\n1092\n01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:16.202\nAnd so the term out-of-band has\na little bit to do with that, right?\n\n1093\n01:05:16.202 --> 01:05:20.870\n>> Yes, out-of-band does play right\ninto what we call key exchange.\n\n1094\n01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:25.530\nWhich is getting the key,\nshared between, or in the hands of both\n\n1095\n01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:28.790\nparties that need to operate with\nthis particular crypto system,\n\n1096\n01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:32.170\nall these cryptographic\ntechniques working together.\n\n1097\n01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:36.570\nIf I use a specific value like\nas I do in the Caesar cipher,\n\n1098\n01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:41.210\nI need to figure out a way to get it to\nyou, without someone else intercepting it.\n\n1099\n01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:45.132\nAnd that's important that\nyou remember out-of-band.\n\n1100\n01:05:45.132 --> 01:05:48.220\nBecause, you think about it,\nif I'm transmitting a chunk of data and\n\n1101\n01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:52.030\nI'm using something like AES,\nwhich is a symmetric algorithm.\n\n1102\n01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:56.090\nIf I send that to you,\nencrypted piece of data,\n\n1103\n01:05:56.090 --> 01:06:00.123\nencrypted using AES,\nI can tell you it's AES and\n\n1104\n01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:04.080\nthat's a standard, so all you have\nto do is implement the AES standard.\n\n1105\n01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.580\nIt's been defined and\nyou could look that up wherever you want.\n\n1106\n01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:10.860\nBut that key,\nlike we said in our previous segment,\n\n1107\n01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:15.030\nthat's what you need to figure out\nthe combination to actually unlock it.\n\n1108\n01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:18.650\nSo I need to get that key to you,\notherwise that data is gonna be\n\n1109\n01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:24.370\nuseless for some period of time until you\nbreak the key or till I send it to you.\n\n1110\n01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:28.170\nSo when I distribute that\nkey I've got a choice.\n\n1111\n01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:31.680\nI can send it along with the encrypted\ndata, which would be a horrible move\n\n1112\n01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.240\nbecause if you did that,\nyou're giving someone encrypted data,\n\n1113\n01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.350\nknowledge of what the algorithm is,\nplus the key.\n\n1114\n01:06:37.350 --> 01:06:40.210\nThey don't need to do anything at\nthat point except, hey, plug and\n\n1115\n01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:41.990\nplay at that point.\n\n1116\n01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:44.570\nHowever, if you do out-of-band,\n\n1117\n01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:48.530\nyou're transmitting the data one way,\nwith knowledge of the algorithm and\n\n1118\n01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:52.132\nthen you're transmitting the key\na totally separate way from that.\n\n1119\n01:06:52.132 --> 01:06:56.756\nExamples could be where you\ntransmit an encrypted message over\n\n1120\n01:06:56.756 --> 01:07:02.450\nthe network, and\nthen what I do is I call you on the phone,\n\n1121\n01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:07.240\nor text message you and say here's\nwhat the code is to open that up.\n\n1122\n01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:10.920\nThey went two different ways,\nthey went out-of-band from one another so\n\n1123\n01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:15.180\nyou have a very low chance rather\n\n1124\n01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:19.450\nof someone intercepting a message here,\nand the key over here.\n\n1125\n01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:22.095\nSo you're really lowering\nthat possibility.\n\n1126\n01:07:22.095 --> 01:07:25.630\n>> And the idea is hopefully if\nthe bad guy has access to one\n\n1127\n01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:29.720\nof our communication channels,\nhe doesn't have access to the other one.\n\n1128\n01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:34.080\nSo if we send the data and the key\nnecessary on the same channel, bad news.\n\n1129\n01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.400\nIf we send the data down one channel and\nwe send the key down a different channel,\n\n1130\n01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.830\nsome other means of communications,\nodds are that they're\n\n1131\n01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:44.560\nnot going to have access to both of\nthose communications channels, and\n\n1132\n01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.512\nit's a more secure key\ndistribution process.\n\n1133\n01:07:47.512 --> 01:07:52.570\nSo out-of-band just means using some\nother method to deliver the key\n\n1134\n01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:56.570\ninformation that you use to deliver\nthe data itself or the encrypted text.\n\n1135\n01:07:56.570 --> 01:08:01.860\n>> Yes, exactly, and out-of-band,\nit's always gonna mean the same thing.\n\n1136\n01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:06.770\nYou're finding alternate means\nto distribute some component of\n\n1137\n01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:12.260\nthis process, but in some places\nit's needed more than others.\n\n1138\n01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:15.700\nSymmetric, it's essential that you\n\n1139\n01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:21.050\nhave some secure out-of-band\nmethod of transmitting that key.\n\n1140\n01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:24.940\nOr at least have some way of securing\nthe key, when you're transmitting over\n\n1141\n01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:28.010\nthe same thing as your data because you\ncould do that because you still have to\n\n1142\n01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:31.170\nfind out a way to secure it so\nit's not easily obtainable.\n\n1143\n01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:37.250\nWhen you are talking asymmetric,\nout-of-band becomes a different\n\n1144\n01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:42.770\nmatter there, and\nwe'll leave that mystery for right now.\n\n1145\n01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:43.480\nWe'll get into it.\n\n1146\n01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:48.410\nSome of you already know and I'm pretty\nsure, but we'll discuss the significance\n\n1147\n01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:51.570\nof that later on, and\nhow the two can work together.\n\n1148\n01:08:51.570 --> 01:08:52.770\nSo that's coming up.\n\n1149\n01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:53.530\n>> All right.\n\n1150\n01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:55.850\nSo what do you want to talk\nabout next on our list here?\n\n1151\n01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:57.370\nWe've got a few more terms to go through.\n\n1152\n01:08:57.370 --> 01:09:01.280\n>> Yeah, there's a few more here,\njust to kind of throw some things out,\n\n1153\n01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:05.200\nwe'll just go through them in\nreally no particular order in here.\n\n1154\n01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:13.590\nWe've got things like a secure channel\nwould be a way of distributing the key.\n\n1155\n01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:15.820\nSo if you're trying to get\na key to someone else and\n\n1156\n01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:19.440\nmaybe only have that one path to send it.\n\n1157\n01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:23.990\nIt's infeasible or\nimpossible to call someone or\n\n1158\n01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:27.300\ntext them or distribute it any other way,\nyou only have that,\n\n1159\n01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:32.040\na secure channel would be a way of\ntransmitting that key information in\n\n1160\n01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:37.810\na way that it can't be intercepted, even\nthough it's going over the same medium.\n\n1161\n01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:40.240\nAnd, things like SSL and stuff like that,\n\n1162\n01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:45.730\nwould be reasonable\nexamples of that concept.\n\n1163\n01:09:45.730 --> 01:09:48.280\n>> Okay, and\nthen we'll just keep going down the list.\n\n1164\n01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.910\nThen we got one-way function?\n\n1165\n01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:56.840\n>> Yeah, a one-way function is another\nterm for something known as a hash.\n\n1166\n01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.805\nA hashing function or\nmessage digest function they call it that,\n\n1167\n01:10:00.805 --> 01:10:06.300\nis something where you shove plain\ntext into it, it gets worked on,\n\n1168\n01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:10.910\nand the end result is you\nhave your original plain text\n\n1169\n01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:14.160\nplus something they call\na message digest or hash.\n\n1170\n01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.450\nWhich is always going to\nbe a fixed length value and\n\n1171\n01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:21.660\nit's gonna be unique,\ndepending on what input you put in.\n\n1172\n01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.740\nSame input, same hash.\n\n1173\n01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:25.550\nDifferent output, different hash.\n\n1174\n01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:30.140\nOr at least it should be, and we'll talk\nmore about that when we get there too.\n\n1175\n01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:35.330\n>> Yeah, the idea behind a one-way\nfunction then is that it,\n\n1176\n01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:39.330\nunlike most of our algorithms that we've\nbeen talking about, it's not reversible.\n\n1177\n01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:40.600\nIt goes one way, and\n\n1178\n01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:44.210\nI can't reverse the process,\nto get the original text back out.\n\n1179\n01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:45.940\nSo, I think that's what\nthey mean by one-way?\n\n1180\n01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:49.270\n>> Yes, that would be correct.\n\n1181\n01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:51.930\nYou could even, if you wanted\n\n1182\n01:10:51.930 --> 01:10:56.400\nto really kind of play by the absolute\nrules of cryptography and\n\n1183\n01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:01.130\ncryptology, it'd probably be better to\nsay it's mathematically infeasible.\n\n1184\n01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:02.640\n>> Mathematically impractical, yeah.\n\n1185\n01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.970\nWe'll never say impossible when\nit comes to do this stuff.\n\n1186\n01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:09.620\n>> Well, and we look at it this way,\nI mean to kind of understand why I am\n\n1187\n01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:15.260\nsaying infeasible instead of\njust letting it say impossible.\n\n1188\n01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:19.890\nYeah, we can say nothing's impossible,\nbut let's give an example.\n\n1189\n01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:23.950\nIt would be like if I gave you\nthree ten-digit prime numbers and\n\n1190\n01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:26.980\nsaid multiply those together and\ntell me what the end result is.\n\n1191\n01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:28.530\nAny one of you can do\nthat with a calculator.\n\n1192\n01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:31.360\nYou've got stuff on your computer right\nnow you can do that with, no problem.\n\n1193\n01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.990\nYour cell phone can do that.\n\n1194\n01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:37.010\n>> You know, but if I told you hey,\nwithout any prior knowledge of those three\n\n1195\n01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:41.530\nnumbers said, here's a value, what three\nprime numbers went in to creating that?\n\n1196\n01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:45.640\nI just ruined your day, I did,\nbecause that's a lot harder thing to do.\n\n1197\n01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.050\nYou can do it, you know, factorization,\n\n1198\n01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:52.140\nreverse factorization of those things but\nit's a lot more effort.\n\n1199\n01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:53.950\nIn fact, they got PhD students and\n\n1200\n01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:59.170\nstuff like that working on that very\nproblem as their graduate thesis.\n\n1201\n01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:02.897\nIt's not unheard of, for colleges to throw\nthat at people that are gonna be PhDs in\n\n1202\n01:12:02.897 --> 01:12:06.207\nmathematics and see, okay and\ncan they come up with something for this?\n\n1203\n01:12:06.207 --> 01:12:07.410\n>> It hasn't been done yet.\n\n1204\n01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:11.896\n>> Yeah, it hasn't been done yet, or\ndone in a way that's actually practical.\n\n1205\n01:12:11.896 --> 01:12:17.380\nSo, that's what infeasible means,\nit's very tough to go the other way.\n\n1206\n01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:22.347\nOr as I joke around, it's like when\nyou say it's infeasible Infeasible and\n\n1207\n01:12:22.347 --> 01:12:24.221\nimpossible are different.\n\n1208\n01:12:24.221 --> 01:12:29.050\nImpossible means, yeah,\nyou literally can't do it.\n\n1209\n01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:32.090\nInfeasible you look at the other way and\ninfeasible would be\n\n1210\n01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:35.480\nthe equivalent of saying, hey, can you\neat an ice cream cone from the bottom up?\n\n1211\n01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.865\nYeah, you can do that,\nbut it's not feasible.\n\n1212\n01:12:37.865 --> 01:12:39.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And real messy.\n\n1213\n01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.940\nYou can do it, but it's real messy.\n\n1214\n01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:46.050\nSo just FYI, that's what that means.\n\n1215\n01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:46.954\n>> Please don't try this at home.\n\n1216\n01:12:46.954 --> 01:12:47.706\n>> Yeah.\n\n1217\n01:12:47.706 --> 01:12:51.580\n>> [LAUGH] All right then,\nwhat's a trapdoor function?\n\n1218\n01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:55.810\n>> A trapdoor function is that little\nthing we just talked about a moment ago,\n\n1219\n01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:57.130\none way function.\n\n1220\n01:12:57.130 --> 01:13:01.560\nTrapdoor function is that\nexception to the rule.\n\n1221\n01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:06.630\nYou've got a one way function that's\ndesigned to be operated one way and\n\n1222\n01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:09.492\nvery tough, or infeasible as we said,\nto go the other way.\n\n1223\n01:13:09.492 --> 01:13:12.400\nA trapdoor function is\nsomething that they can\n\n1224\n01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:17.170\nplace in something like a one way\nfunction, that no matter what you do,\n\n1225\n01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:21.695\nit's impractical to go the other way, but\n\n1226\n01:13:21.695 --> 01:13:25.510\nif you know this one trap door function,\nyou can easily reverse the process.\n\n1227\n01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:26.145\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1228\n01:13:26.145 --> 01:13:27.835\n>> It's basically like that.\n\n1229\n01:13:27.835 --> 01:13:29.535\nIt is a trapdoor.\n\n1230\n01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:32.095\nIt is a shortcut to do this.\n\n1231\n01:13:32.095 --> 01:13:33.655\nInstead of going through\nall this intensive stuff,\n\n1232\n01:13:33.655 --> 01:13:34.635\nit's something they place in there.\n\n1233\n01:13:34.635 --> 01:13:36.890\nIt says, hey,\nif you call on this function and\n\n1234\n01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:40.680\nthrow that in there with a little\nextra information that they may or\n\n1235\n01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:45.440\nmay not request, then I can do this\nno problem, it's very, very simple.\n\n1236\n01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.090\nBut it would be like that same\nproblem with three prime numbers.\n\n1237\n01:13:49.090 --> 01:13:53.870\nIt would be like me saying,\nhere's three prime numbers, or\n\n1238\n01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:58.160\nhere's the result of three prime numbers\nbeing multiplied together, that's tough.\n\n1239\n01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:03.110\nBut if all of a sudden that same process\nis going on, and you've got this and\n\n1240\n01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:06.170\nyou're going, well damn,\nhow am I gonna reverse that?\n\n1241\n01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:10.245\nIn this case, I could be hiding\naround the corner going psst,\n\n1242\n01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:12.940\nhere's one of them, give you\nthe answer to one of those numbers.\n\n1243\n01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:15.240\nI just made it a lot easier for you.\n\n1244\n01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.040\nSo that's sort of what\na trapdoor function does.\n\n1245\n01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.238\nIt just makes things easier\nto move the other way.\n\n1246\n01:14:22.238 --> 01:14:23.750\n>> And then when we talk about ciphers,\n\n1247\n01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:26.250\nwe've mentioned ciphers\na couple times here.\n\n1248\n01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:29.000\nWhen we talk about ciphers,\nwe can kinda categorize them, right?\n\n1249\n01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.380\nThere's different types of ciphers\nthat we're gonna end up working with.\n\n1250\n01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:36.480\n>> Yes, there's two that come into play,\nand they really come into play on\n\n1251\n01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:42.360\nthe classical side or the symmetric side,\nwhich is the stream and the block.\n\n1252\n01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.789\nAnd so, to kinda compare and\ncontrast those two,\n\n1253\n01:14:45.789 --> 01:14:49.054\na stream cipher would be,\nbasically the Caesar\n\n1254\n01:14:49.054 --> 01:14:53.995\ncipher is a great example of a stream\ncypher because what are you doing?\n\n1255\n01:14:53.995 --> 01:14:56.460\nYou're converting stuff letter by letter,\n\n1256\n01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:59.520\nor bit by bit if you wanna\nput it in those terms.\n\n1257\n01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.720\nA stream cipher works at the bit level.\n\n1258\n01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:06.472\nWhatever comes in gets broken into\nindividual constituent bits and\n\n1259\n01:15:06.472 --> 01:15:10.560\ngets converted one by one all\nthe way on through until it's done.\n\n1260\n01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.360\nWhereas, if we look at its counterpart,\n\n1261\n01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:17.790\nthe block cipher, a block cipher would\ntake that same chunk of information,\n\n1262\n01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:20.970\ninstead of converting it\none character at a time,\n\n1263\n01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:26.430\nit would actually break it into chunks and\nconvert that whole chunk at once.\n\n1264\n01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:28.940\nAnd that chunk is known as a block, and\n\n1265\n01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:32.700\nthat block size is defined\nby the algorithm itself.\n\n1266\n01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.180\nYou don't get to choose that.\n\n1267\n01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:36.510\nWhoever implements it, puts that in there.\n\n1268\n01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:43.440\nHappens to be that most blocks have a size\nof 64 kilobytes, it's about that size.\n\n1269\n01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.930\nThere are some that have\nlarger block sizes than that.\n\n1270\n01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:52.110\nAbout 128 is one that you're seeing now\nin some of the modern block cyphers.\n\n1271\n01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:55.964\nBut either way,\nif you have one that's 64 or 128,\n\n1272\n01:15:55.964 --> 01:15:59.572\nit means you have to have that\nmany bits in it before it\n\n1273\n01:15:59.572 --> 01:16:04.096\nwill start the encryption process\non that chunk of information.\n\n1274\n01:16:04.096 --> 01:16:08.370\nNow there's some things with that.\n\n1275\n01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:10.510\nIf we were to break this\ndown to a simple level and\n\n1276\n01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:15.570\nsaid you have a message that is 26 bits\nlong, and I said your block size is 4,\n\n1277\n01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:18.570\nthat's a very,\nvery simple thing to look at.\n\n1278\n01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:20.415\nAnd it's like,\nhow many times does 4 go into 26?\n\n1279\n01:16:20.415 --> 01:16:23.106\nWell you got, I don't know,\nno, I'm kidding.\n\n1280\n01:16:23.106 --> 01:16:26.921\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It goes in there 6 times,\n\n1281\n01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:30.310\nplus we got 2 as the remainder.\n\n1282\n01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:35.130\nWhat happens is that that's actually\nseven blocks that's going to\n\n1283\n01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:39.900\noccur in a block cipher when it breaks\nthat up, if it had a block size of four.\n\n1284\n01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:43.950\nAnd the reason why it has seven is\nwe have that two as a remainder, so\n\n1285\n01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:46.120\nit's gotta throw those\nin the seventh block.\n\n1286\n01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:46.820\nBut then what?\n\n1287\n01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:48.650\nDoes it just operate on those two bits?\n\n1288\n01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:53.950\nNo, it pads it out with two extra bits to\nfill out that four, and then converts it.\n\n1289\n01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:59.230\nSo blocks in a block cipher will always\nbe 100% full, or it won't exist.\n\n1290\n01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:00.890\nIt's either there or it isn't.\n\n1291\n01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:05.600\nSo if that same message\nwas 28 characters long,\n\n1292\n01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.800\nit will have 7 blocks filled with bits,\nno padding.\n\n1293\n01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:12.750\nAnd it will rock and roll on that,\nand you're ready to go.\n\n1294\n01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:15.200\nBut that's kind of the two.\n\n1295\n01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:18.750\nNow this one, any stats on block handling,\nwhich size is most efficient?\n\n1296\n01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:23.183\nThat's actually a very good question.\n\n1297\n01:17:23.183 --> 01:17:26.823\nOkay now, what we're gonna talk about.\n\n1298\n01:17:26.823 --> 01:17:31.740\n[LAUGH] Well,\nit actually is an interesting thing\n\n1299\n01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:36.610\nbecause the two block sizes\nthat are common are 64, 128.\n\n1300\n01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:41.450\nReason why you've got those is\nthe early block ciphers were always 64,\n\n1301\n01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:46.710\nand it's because someone that\nis a higher pay grade than\n\n1302\n01:17:46.710 --> 01:17:50.830\nI am figured out that with the memory and\nprocessing power that was available way\n\n1303\n01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:56.080\nback when in the dark ages, that that\nwas the perfect balance between the two.\n\n1304\n01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:01.660\nIt would use memory efficiently and\nuse processors efficiently.\n\n1305\n01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:04.490\nBecause you go back far enough and\nwhen we're talking about when these block\n\n1306\n01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:09.380\nciphers first came out,\nyou're talking about the old stories about\n\n1307\n01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:15.780\nthe old Apple computers and all that\nstuff about how much memory they had.\n\n1308\n01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:19.580\nWe're talking those times,\nand so memory was small.\n\n1309\n01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:24.390\nThey needed to optimize\nthe use of that memory,\n\n1310\n01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:26.720\nthey didn't have these\nhuge chunk of memory and\n\n1311\n01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.390\ndid not have all this extra processor\npower that we've got nowadays.\n\n1312\n01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:33.900\nSo 64 was found to be the most efficient.\n\n1313\n01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:40.392\nNow, with the modern ones, when you look\nat something like AES, AES is gonna say,\n\n1314\n01:18:40.392 --> 01:18:45.970\nokay, we're 128 block size, which is\noptimized for modern stuff instead.\n\n1315\n01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:49.220\nSo it's more efficient\nbased on what we have now.\n\n1316\n01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:51.930\nWill you notice it with everyday use?\n\n1317\n01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:52.920\nProbably not.\n\n1318\n01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:57.605\nIf you chose one over the other,\nyou will notice it, but\n\n1319\n01:18:57.605 --> 01:19:02.450\nyou've really got to do some\nextremely detailed analysis of it,\n\n1320\n01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:06.340\nwhich is way out of\nthe ability of most people.\n\n1321\n01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:12.804\nA cryptographer could tell you, hey,\nif I feed in 100 different data sets and\n\n1322\n01:19:12.804 --> 01:19:18.920\nof different sizes and timed them all and\ndid a one for one comparison on the two,\n\n1323\n01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:23.970\nthis one operates faster than this one,\nbut who knows?\n\n1324\n01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:27.090\nI mean, there still could\nbe other factors in play.\n\n1325\n01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:29.240\nYou have to compare the same algorithm.\n\n1326\n01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:32.380\nSome algorithms support\nmultiple block sizes.\n\n1327\n01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:34.260\nAnd when the developer implements that,\n\n1328\n01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:36.670\nthey just hard code in which\none they want and that's it.\n\n1329\n01:19:36.670 --> 01:19:38.505\nYou don't get to choose\nthe block size there.\n\n1330\n01:19:38.505 --> 01:19:44.040\nSo if you had AES 128, AES 64, then you\ncould run these data sets through and\n\n1331\n01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:48.960\ncompare them on the same hardware, compare\nthem to which one's more efficient.\n\n1332\n01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.310\nThat's not always gonna matter.\n\n1333\n01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:51.492\nIt's just not.\n\n1334\n01:19:51.492 --> 01:19:55.650\nThe every day person could care less,\ncould really could care less.\n\n1335\n01:19:55.650 --> 01:19:59.720\nIt would only be someone that's doing\nfine, detailed cryptanalysis or\n\n1336\n01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:03.110\nreally optimizing the system or\nsomething like that.\n\n1337\n01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:06.010\nThose people don't care,\nyou probably won't.\n\n1338\n01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:10.253\n>> All right, and I think there's terms\nwe've already used a couple times here,\n\n1339\n01:20:10.253 --> 01:20:12.990\ntransposition and substitution ciphers.\n\n1340\n01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:15.373\n>> Yes, those ones are important terms.\n\n1341\n01:20:15.373 --> 01:20:17.191\nAnd we saw good examples of them.\n\n1342\n01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:22.420\nThe substitution cipher, well,\nthat's the Caesar cipher.\n\n1343\n01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:25.440\nThat's exactly what that is is that\nyou're taking one character and\n\n1344\n01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:28.780\nsubstituting it for another, okay.\n\n1345\n01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:30.620\nNow notice the way I phrased that.\n\n1346\n01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:32.960\nYou're substituting one character for\nanother.\n\n1347\n01:20:33.970 --> 01:20:38.410\nDoes character imply\nanything alphanumeric?\n\n1348\n01:20:38.410 --> 01:20:42.652\nYes, but\nit also implies characters of any type.\n\n1349\n01:20:42.652 --> 01:20:46.730\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> [LAUGH] It could be literally anything.\n\n1350\n01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:50.830\nI was showing, in our first episode, I was\nshowing that stuff from Disneyland, and\n\n1351\n01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:53.290\nthat Indiana Jones ride,\nall those things in there.\n\n1352\n01:20:53.290 --> 01:20:55.890\nThat's a substitution cipher,\nthat's all that is.\n\n1353\n01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:57.190\nAnd what they've done is they've said for\n\n1354\n01:20:57.190 --> 01:21:00.740\nevery time you see this character,\nreplace it with this one.\n\n1355\n01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:02.607\nThose characters that\nthey put in that ride,\n\n1356\n01:21:02.607 --> 01:21:06.785\nthat's someone that some Imagineer,\nDisney calls it, came up with.\n\n1357\n01:21:06.785 --> 01:21:08.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was just some random thing.\n\n1358\n01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:09.740\nThey said, okay, let's just go ahead.\n\n1359\n01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:12.410\nAnd they did it, made them look artistic,\nand that's what they did.\n\n1360\n01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:15.530\nPeople have been doing that for years,\nthey literally have been doing that for\n\n1361\n01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:17.880\nyears in all different types of forms.\n\n1362\n01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:23.080\nI mean, you can look up something online\ncalled the pigpen or Freemason's cipher,\n\n1363\n01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:29.020\nand it's one of the oldest types of\nsubstitution ciphers you can find.\n\n1364\n01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:33.052\nAnd you pretty much have all have seen it,\nyou just may not have called it that.\n\n1365\n01:21:33.052 --> 01:21:36.780\nMost people do not call it\nthe Freemason's or pigpen cipher.\n\n1366\n01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:43.050\nAnd what it is is that they\nuse two tic tac toe or\n\n1367\n01:21:43.050 --> 01:21:48.230\npound signs, and then they have two kind\nof signs like this, like multiplication.\n\n1368\n01:21:48.230 --> 01:21:53.340\nAnd what they do is the first\npound sign is just simple,\n\n1369\n01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:55.610\nlooks like a keypad on a phone,\nbasically, envision that.\n\n1370\n01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:59.870\nAnd you've got the letters ABC, DEF, GHI.\n\n1371\n01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:04.885\nAnd then next one has a pound\nsign with dots in each spot.\n\n1372\n01:22:04.885 --> 01:22:08.455\nAnd then each one of those\ncontinues on from where the I is.\n\n1373\n01:22:08.455 --> 01:22:10.725\nIt's that J, K, and all the way through.\n\n1374\n01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:14.675\nAnd then for the last eight characters,\nyou go through the two crosses.\n\n1375\n01:22:14.675 --> 01:22:18.490\nOne is just a cross and\nhas no dots in it, the other one does.\n\n1376\n01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:19.030\nNow, you do.\n\n1377\n01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:20.590\nI don't know if you can\nfind a picture of that?\n\n1378\n01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:22.580\n>> Yeah, I was gonna pull up\na picture real quick, here.\n\n1379\n01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.050\nGive me one second, Jason.\n\n1380\n01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:29.000\n>> All right, but what you do in here,\nis that when you;re writing your message,\n\n1381\n01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.970\nyou just write your message\nout in your plain text.\n\n1382\n01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:35.200\nAnd then what you do is you\nget out your diagram, or\n\n1383\n01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:38.640\nwhatever, of the pigpen cipher,\nand you just\n\n1384\n01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:45.580\ngo through and go A, B, C, D, E,\nF, okay, like we have on here.\n\n1385\n01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:50.780\nIf you're message was like, hello.\n\n1386\n01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:53.640\nWhat it would have is have that upside\n\n1387\n01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.430\ndown box with the bottom\ncut off that we see.\n\n1388\n01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:57.640\nE would be a full box.\n\n1389\n01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.450\nThen the L would be two\nof those backwards,\n\n1390\n01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:03.550\nor those Ls with the dot on it,\nso to speak.\n\n1391\n01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:04.550\nAnd then you just keep doing that,\n\n1392\n01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:08.435\ngoing all the way down through as a\nsubstitution to create your final message.\n\n1393\n01:23:08.435 --> 01:23:11.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's simple, it's easy, and it works.\n\n1394\n01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:14.680\nAnd worked for a long, long, long time.\n\n1395\n01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:21.010\nAnd it still is used in certain\nsituations just for simple things.\n\n1396\n01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:23.100\nIt's one of those things\nthat's actually kind of funny.\n\n1397\n01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:26.390\nThis wasn't known for\na long time, it was out there.\n\n1398\n01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:31.090\nYou can actually go to some old places in\nEurope, that were done by the Freemason's,\n\n1399\n01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:34.470\nand you can some messages\nin some obscure places,\n\n1400\n01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:36.085\nchiseled in like this from way back.\n\n1401\n01:23:36.085 --> 01:23:37.080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n1402\n01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.780\nit was very obscure\nthat they do this then.\n\n1403\n01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:44.720\nThen in the modern era,\npeople became aware of it for a while.\n\n1404\n01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:48.920\nAnd then it's kind of like nowadays,\nsome people have heard of this,\n\n1405\n01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:50.590\nsome people haven't.\n\n1406\n01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:56.210\nI remember that cuz this was when I\nwas way early on in my early 20s,\n\n1407\n01:23:56.210 --> 01:24:00.170\nI saw a guy who said he was writing\nthe PIN codes for people in his company.\n\n1408\n01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:00.881\nHe was system admin.\n\n1409\n01:24:00.881 --> 01:24:02.570\n>>

and\nset an eight character password for them,\n\n1412\n01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:14.838\nand he would convert it\nusing that pigpen cipher.\n\n1413\n01:24:14.838 --> 01:24:15.549\n>>

01:24:42.330\nAnd he says, no one's ever broken this.\n\n1423\n01:24:42.330 --> 01:24:43.175\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1424\n01:24:43.175 --> 01:24:47.700\n>> And I was the one, I was like,\nI know what you're

because, I kid you not,\nI'm not a genius or anything at this,\n\n1428\n01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.030\nI'm just saying, I knew it.\n\n1429\n01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.970\nThe reason why I knew it?\n\n1430\n01:24:56.970 --> 01:25:00.710\nBecause they played that stuff\nduring the commercial break when I\n\n1431\n01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:02.460\nwas watching Transformers as a kid.\n\n1432\n01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:04.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When they used to do those things like,\n\n1433\n01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:07.770\noh, the more you know, or little\ninformational things to teach us stuff?\n\n1434\n01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:13.490\nThat's what it is, there was things\nlike Schoolhouse Rock, and this stuff.\n\n1435\n01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:14.430\nThat's where I got it from.\n\n1436\n01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:14.970\nHe was stunned.\n\n1437\n01:25:14.970 --> 01:25:16.120\nHe was like, how'd you know that?\n\n1438\n01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:20.880\nTry telling a room of people you\nlearned it watching a cartoon.\n\n1439\n01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.120\n>> Watching a cartoon, yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1440\n01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:24.057\n>> Yeah, I was watching Optimus Prime and\n\n1441\n01:25:24.057 --> 01:25:25.710\nMegatron, battling my cereal.\n\n1442\n01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:28.000\nIt was like, oh,\nthat might be useful, and keep going.\n\n1443\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.840\nAnd that's where my\ncunning skills came from.\n\n1444\n01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you never know.\n\n1445\n01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:40.160\n>> All right then, let us, so substitution\ncipher, then transposition cipher.\n\n1446\n01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:43.075\n>> Transposition cipher would\nbe like something like scytale.\n\n1447\n01:25:43.075 --> 01:25:49.865\nThat's the best example we have is that\nthe encryption process is carried out\n\n1448\n01:25:49.865 --> 01:25:55.275\nby the encryption and decryption, the\nwhole process is dependent on positioning.\n\n1449\n01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:59.860\nAnd so scytale is just one\nbecause you've got the strap\n\n1450\n01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:03.780\nthat you wrap around the thing and\nthat you write your plain text across.\n\n1451\n01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:08.740\nThen when you unravel the strap,\nit's just a bunch of letters written\n\n1452\n01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:13.360\nacross that strap, and\nthat's your cipher text.\n\n1453\n01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.800\nSo you just changed the position of those\ncharacters relative to one another.\n\n1454\n01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:22.769\nSomeone seeing that without\nthe proper diameter dowel will not be\n\n1455\n01:26:22.769 --> 01:26:24.860\nable to read those things.\n\n1456\n01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:28.890\nSo, therefore, it's all nice and secure.\n\n1457\n01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:31.788\nThat dowel would actually\nbe the key slash algorithm,\n\n1458\n01:26:31.788 --> 01:26:35.020\nwe could actually define it more,\nbut we won't worry.\n\n1459\n01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:40.710\nThe algorithm would be the dowel, and\nthen the algorithm would be the diameter.\n\n1460\n01:26:40.710 --> 01:26:41.970\n>> Diameter would be your key, exactly.\n\n1461\n01:26:41.970 --> 01:26:43.650\n>> Yeah, would be the key.\n\n1462\n01:26:43.650 --> 01:26:47.610\n>> All right, and then to round off\nour list there, we've got cryptogram.\n\n1463\n01:26:47.610 --> 01:26:49.660\n>> Yeah, I put this one here,\na cryptogram,\n\n1464\n01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:52.780\nbecause a cryptogram is really\na cryptographic puzzle.\n\n1465\n01:26:52.780 --> 01:27:00.600\nI would think everyone in here has,\nin our audience and such,\n\n1466\n01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.290\nhas seen a cryptogram at some point even\nthough they may not have used that term.\n\n1467\n01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:10.800\nIt's a very, very common thing to hear,\nor was at some point.\n\n1468\n01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.030\nCryptograms have been around for ages.\n\n1469\n01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:14.640\nWhen you talk about a cryptogram,\n\n1470\n01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:19.040\ntypically they're referring to\nsome sort of a puzzle or game.\n\n1471\n01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:23.810\nAnd people have been doing these for\nsuch a long time.\n\n1472\n01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:24.820\nI would say, right now,\n\n1473\n01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:29.985\nthey've been popular probably\nsince the middle of the 1800s.\n\n1474\n01:27:29.985 --> 01:27:33.644\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They would publish them in papers,\n\n1475\n01:27:33.644 --> 01:27:36.905\nin newspapers, or what have you.\n\n1476\n01:27:36.905 --> 01:27:39.910\nThey would make these things up,\nand people would go ahead and\n\n1477\n01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:40.750\nconvert these things.\n\n1478\n01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:41.732\nSome people still do.\n\n1479\n01:27:41.732 --> 01:27:45.140\nIn their newspapers,\nthey'll get puzzle books or\n\n1480\n01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:48.540\nwhat have you, and\nsolve these cryptograms.\n\n1481\n01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:50.695\n>> Cracker Jacks, that's where I got mine.\n\n1482\n01:27:50.695 --> 01:27:51.770\n[LAUGHS]\n>> Yeah, you'll see\n\n1483\n01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:55.280\nthey've been all over the place,\nthey just may not have called it that.\n\n1484\n01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.410\nThey may have said, hey,\nhere's a puzzle, solve it.\n\n1485\n01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:58.760\nAnd they'll put that out there.\n\n1486\n01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:02.710\nYou've seen them all over the place, those\nlittle cryptograms, those little puzzles.\n\n1487\n01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:06.550\nYou could go online to usatoday.com,\nthey've got one in there.\n\n1488\n01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:09.260\nI think like it's every day\nthey usually put one up there.\n\n1489\n01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:12.160\nI see them in the back of\nin-flight magazines on the planes.\n\n1490\n01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:16.400\nBut they're just a puzzle that's\nsupposed to be a brain teaser, and there\n\n1491\n01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.080\nare all sorts of different difficulties-\n>> Figure out all these different words,\n\n1492\n01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.530\nand then each word has a couple\nletters that are circled.\n\n1493\n01:28:23.530 --> 01:28:26.030\nAnd then in the end, I can put\nthose circled letters together, and\n\n1494\n01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:27.970\nI can get out my mystery.\n\n1495\n01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:32.040\n>> Yeah, exactly,\nit would be very much something like that.\n\n1496\n01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.800\nAnd so you'll be seeing cryptograms.\n\n1497\n01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:40.750\nWe didn't do any today during\nthe lectures in our presentations.\n\n1498\n01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:46.745\nThere was a cryptogram that was\nposted ahead of the course for\n\n1499\n01:28:46.745 --> 01:28:49.670\nour contest, the Vigenere cipher.\n\n1500\n01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:52.280\nThat would be,\nthat's a cryptogram, period.\n\n1501\n01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nothing else to really add to that.\n\n1502\n01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:59.280\nBut over the course from here forward,\n\n1503\n01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.410\nwe're gonna start putting some cryptograms\nout there for you to have some fun with,\n\n1504\n01:29:02.410 --> 01:29:04.901\nand see just how smart you think you are.\n\n1505\n01:29:04.901 --> 01:29:05.440\n>> Nice.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1506\n01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.359\n>> So just how smart you think you are,\n\n1507\n01:29:08.359 --> 01:29:09.680\nbut-\n>> All right.\n\n1508\n01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.870\n>> Just to play with some of the concepts,\nthat's why we're doing it, so\n\n1509\n01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:14.690\nyou guys can try some of this stuff out,\nthat's what the purpose is.\n\n1510\n01:29:14.690 --> 01:29:15.680\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n1511\n01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.330\nAll right, well, Sean, we got a lot\nof information of out you there.\n\n1512\n01:29:18.330 --> 01:29:22.470\nWe got a lot of our core concepts defined,\nour terminology defined,\n\n1513\n01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:26.330\nstuff that we're gonna need as we\nprogress through our course this week, or\n\n1514\n01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:28.760\nthrough the later episodes in this week.\n\n1515\n01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:33.040\nSo anything else we wanna throw at them\nbefore we call it the end of our show?\n\n1516\n01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.835\n>> Yeah, rest up that's what I would say.\n\n1517\n01:29:34.835 --> 01:29:37.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's gonna be a lot of nice stuff\n\n1518\n01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:40.980\ngoing on, a lot of brain power you're\ngonna be using while you're doing it,\n\n1519\n01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.340\nso be prepared.\n\n1520\n01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:46.608\nThis was just to taste, but you're gonna\nlike what's coming up in the following\n\n1521\n01:29:46.608 --> 01:29:49.060\nepisodes, I really think you will.\n\n1522\n01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:51.800\n>> I know i'm looking forward to it,\nI hope you guys are, too.\n\n1523\n01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.510\nWe wanna thank you guys for

00:00:33.845\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:37.140\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.330\nHow you doing today, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.950\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n7\n00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.000\nHow about you?\n>> I am doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.370\nWe got another episode in our\ncryptography series that we're doing.\n\n9\n00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.860\nWe're covering Sean's\nbook on cryptography.\n\n10\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.685\nAnd in today's episode, we're gonna talk\nabout the components of cryptography and\n\n11\n00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:54.510\nwhat makes up, I don't wanna\nsay what makes up cryptography.\n\n12\n00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.266\nBut a lot of different pieces and\ncomponents that we really need to\n\n13\n00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.987\nunderstand, if we're truly\ngonna understand cryptography.\n\n14\n00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:04.795\nAnd be able to intelligently choose the\nappropriate algorithms when necessary and\n\n15\n00:01:04.795 --> 00:01:06.550\nthings like that.\n\n16\n00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.255\nSo Sean, let's start with a little\nreview from what we did yesterday and\n\n17\n00:01:10.255 --> 00:01:12.540\nkinda make sure we are all\nfresh in our mind.\n\n18\n00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.610\n>> Yes, yeah let's go ahead and\ndo that review.\n\n19\n00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.440\nAnd what we're trying to do is,\nwe covered a lot in the previous episode\n\n20\n00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.640\nof little pieces, and we didn't talk\nabout really any specific order.\n\n21\n00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.760\nNow we're trying to just kind\nof bolt everything together.\n\n22\n00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.115\nTalk about some different variations and\n\n23\n00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:33.016\nwhat they mean to give you kind of\nthe overall picture of things before\n\n24\n00:01:33.016 --> 00:01:36.732\nwe drill into specific applications and\nimplementations of it.\n\n25\n00:01:36.732 --> 00:01:38.565\nSo this is a really vital thing to do so\n\n26\n00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.941\nwe all want to make sure\nwe're on the same page.\n\n27\n00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:47.330\nSo, yesterday we talked about\nthings like algorithms to start.\n\n28\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.750\nAn algorithm as we learned,\nis a formula that says how\n\n29\n00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.620\ninformation is gonna be transformed\nto a different state, if you will.\n\n30\n00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.880\nAnd that's either gonna be\nfrom plaintext to cyphertext\n\n31\n00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.110\nthrough a process called encryption or\n\n32\n00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.350\nthrough cyphertext to plaintext\nthrough a process known as decryption.\n\n33\n00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.970\nAnd so that was the big thing,\nthat was the algorithm.\n\n34\n00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.590\nAnd then we have with the algorithm,\nwe had things such as a key space?\n\n35\n00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.744\nA key space would be defined\nby the algorithm itself.\n\n36\n00:02:19.744 --> 00:02:23.941\nIt would say what the full range\nof keys that you can have or\n\n37\n00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:26.760\nselect from for that algorithm.\n\n38\n00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.501\nAnd every algorithm is gonna define\ndifferent rules on what keys\n\n39\n00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.660\ncan look like.\n\n40\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.646\nThat will define just how big or\nhow small the key space can be.\n\n41\n00:02:37.646 --> 00:02:42.266\nWe talked about for example,\nthe Caesar cipher and the Caesar cipher is\n\n42\n00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:46.347\na very simplistic example but\nis a valid example nonetheless,\n\n43\n00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:50.127\nthat showed that you could\njust use the English alphabet.\n\n44\n00:02:50.127 --> 00:02:53.352\nYou had about the mid 20s, 26, 27,\n\n45\n00:02:53.352 --> 00:02:59.210\nI know we had some discussion on that,\nkeys available and that was it.\n\n46\n00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.840\nThere is no more, no less.\n\n47\n00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.090\nSo, not a big key space but\na key space none the less.\n\n48\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.455\nAnd we talk about the fact that if\nyou go to more modern algorithms.\n\n49\n00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:13.525\nI mean there's much, much,\nmuch larger key spaces than that,\n\n50\n00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:18.525\nsubstantially larger, more than you can\njust stumble upon the correct key or\n\n51\n00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:21.855\nuse a decoder ring or\nwhatever [LAUGH] to get lucky on.\n\n52\n00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:26.376\nWe talked about AES having,\nwe talked about digging this trench and\n\n53\n00:03:26.376 --> 00:03:29.320\nfilling it full of ping pong balls.\n\n54\n00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.907\nAnd just to kind of give us at least some\nunderstanding of just how big a key space\n\n55\n00:03:33.907 --> 00:03:35.820\nwe're talking about.\n\n56\n00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.155\nSo, that's a different algorithm,\nmuch more power, much more complexity.\n\n57\n00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:43.270\nBut it still operates on some of the same\n\n58\n00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.370\nprinciples that we see in the earlier\nones, like the Caesar cipher.\n\n59\n00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.475\nSome comes in, some comes out that's\nbeen transformed or it can be reversed.\n\n60\n00:03:52.475 --> 00:03:56.370\nAnd, so that's, that's a big-\n>> We could really bring in our old\n\n61\n00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.370\nformulas that we remember\nfrom network plus, right?\n\n62\n00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.790\nWhen we're doing our subnetting?\n\n63\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.160\nWith your Cesar cipher for example you\ngot 26 or 27 keys in your key space,\n\n64\n00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.850\nif we take a AES256 well that's 256\nbits that I have in my key, right?\n\n65\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.920\nSo I can do a formula two\nto the 256 power, and\n\n66\n00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.180\nthat could tell me how many\npossible keys are in there.\n\n67\n00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.830\nAssuming that the algorithm allows\nevery single value in there.\n\n68\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.650\nBut yeah, that's quite a large key space.\n\n69\n00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.980\nAnd the point is,\nI might not have enough time or\n\n70\n00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.370\nthe processing power to try to get\nthrough all of those possible keys.\n\n71\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.860\nAt least by the time I\nneed the information.\n\n72\n00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.077\n>> Yes and that's something, either it's\ngonna be known as a brute force attack.\n\n73\n00:04:39.077 --> 00:04:42.752\nOr they sometimes,\nto make sound more technical and exciting,\n\n74\n00:04:42.752 --> 00:04:45.009\nit's an exhaustive key space search.\n\n75\n00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.661\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n>> Or, an exhaustive key search.\n\n76\n00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.473\n>> Oh, I like that.\n\n77\n00:04:47.473 --> 00:04:49.372\n>> And you will be exhausted\nby the time you find it.\n\n78\n00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.819\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's kind of apropos for\n\n79\n00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.238\nthe situation.\n\n80\n00:04:53.238 --> 00:04:54.645\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And actually,\n\n81\n00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:58.292\nMike brought an interesting\nlittle detail in there.\n\n82\n00:04:58.292 --> 00:04:58.883\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n83\n00:04:58.883 --> 00:05:02.042\n>> Is assuming you can use all those keys,\n\n84\n00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:06.938\nthere's plenty of situations\nwhere they have blocked out.\n\n85\n00:05:06.938 --> 00:05:10.388\nThey define a large key space\nas part of an algorithm but\n\n86\n00:05:10.388 --> 00:05:14.663\nthen they actually block out parts\nsome of those keys from being used\n\n87\n00:05:14.663 --> 00:05:17.602\nbecause they're pointless\nto be using them.\n\n88\n00:05:17.602 --> 00:05:21.138\nAnd they actually could show\nvulnerabilities in the system,\n\n89\n00:05:21.138 --> 00:05:23.247\nwe talk about the the Caesar Cypher.\n\n90\n00:05:23.247 --> 00:05:29.534\nIf we're gonna go with the idea that we\nhave zero to 26 as our possible keys,\n\n91\n00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:33.720\nyou would probably discard\nzero right off the bat.\n\n92\n00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.904\n>> [CROSSTALK] One would assume, right?\n\n93\n00:05:34.904 --> 00:05:36.620\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I would hope.\n\n94\n00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.473\n>> Cuz the plaintext and\nthe ciphertext is gonna look very similar,\n\n95\n00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:41.954\nif I don't shift at all.\n\n96\n00:05:41.954 --> 00:05:42.491\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n97\n00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:44.970\n>> And that's a little problem there, so\n\n98\n00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.999\nyeah, you would discard that,\n\n99\n00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:50.694\nyou would assume that someone\nwould never wanna use that.\n\n100\n00:05:50.694 --> 00:05:55.330\nAnd just to keep it from being\ninadvertently used, just chuck it.\n\n101\n00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.794\nGet it out of there so\nit's not a problem, so\n\n102\n00:05:57.794 --> 00:06:00.537\nyou have an algorithm that\ndefines by its rules.\n\n103\n00:06:00.537 --> 00:06:04.578\nA key space of a certain size but\nwe immediately blacklist that and\n\n104\n00:06:04.578 --> 00:06:09.516\nsay that's gone, you can't use that so\nthat's thrown out of the pile, yeah.\n\n105\n00:06:09.516 --> 00:06:12.839\n>> Most of them aren't gonna take\nzeroes cuz if I start plugging in, and\n\n106\n00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.590\nI plug in 256 zeroes into\nthis mathematical formula,\n\n107\n00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.002\nit probably causes a problem, or\nit doesn't change enough, maybe.\n\n108\n00:06:19.002 --> 00:06:20.627\n>> Yeah, it definitely could do that.\n\n109\n00:06:20.627 --> 00:06:24.320\nEvery algorithm's gonna be\na little bit different.\n\n110\n00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.615\nAnd then there's also, to be fair\nabout it, to mention with algorithms,\n\n111\n00:06:28.615 --> 00:06:33.117\nthere's also flaws in algorithms that\ncause certain things when they come out\n\n112\n00:06:33.117 --> 00:06:36.220\nthe back end to tell you\nhow the algorithm works.\n\n113\n00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.150\nIn fact, one of the examples that\nwe mentioned in our first episode,\n\n114\n00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.250\nthe Enigma machine.\n\n115\n00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.688\nThe Enigma machine did have some flaws in\nit, and one of them was is that certain,\n\n116\n00:06:47.688 --> 00:06:52.440\nif you had certain letters in\nyour settings on your system.\n\n117\n00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.304\nLetters in the message wouldn't\ntranslate back to themselves or no,\n\n118\n00:06:55.304 --> 00:06:57.062\nthey would translate back to themselves.\n\n119\n00:06:57.062 --> 00:07:01.217\nKinda off top of my head, so\nit would just that little fact?\n\n120\n00:07:01.217 --> 00:07:05.585\nWould reveal something about\nthe internal workings of the system, and\n\n121\n00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:07.780\nyou get that with every algorithm.\n\n122\n00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.161\nThose things can result in maybe\ndiscarding certain keys, or\n\n123\n00:07:12.161 --> 00:07:15.543\na re-architecting of\nthe algorithm overall.\n\n124\n00:07:15.543 --> 00:07:19.393\nSo that leads to some of the stuff we\ntalked like yesterday, which we're\n\n125\n00:07:19.393 --> 00:07:23.750\ngonna review a little bit here and\nkind of expand upon some of these ideas.\n\n126\n00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:29.586\nBut yeah that's, anyway that is\nthe relationship between algorithm key and\n\n127\n00:07:29.586 --> 00:07:32.320\nkey space and all that good stuff.\n\n128\n00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.027\nAnd if it helps you just remember\nan algorithm is basically a blueprint,\n\n129\n00:07:37.027 --> 00:07:38.274\nthat's all it is.\n\n130\n00:07:38.274 --> 00:07:42.138\nAnd so if formulas aren't your thing and\nI understand if it's not.\n\n131\n00:07:42.138 --> 00:07:46.659\nIt's just a blueprint saying this\nis how we are gonna do things,\n\n132\n00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:51.140\nand you follow that blueprint and\nyou get an end result.\n\n133\n00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.345\nSo the blueprints can be more complex,\nless complex but\n\n134\n00:07:54.345 --> 00:07:56.948\nit's still a blueprint\nat the end of the day.\n\n135\n00:07:56.948 --> 00:08:00.592\nThat we will use to perform our process.\n\n136\n00:08:00.592 --> 00:08:03.037\n>> All right, and then, so,\nwe've got a nice review then.\n\n137\n00:08:03.037 --> 00:08:06.518\nAnd again, if you need more review just\ngo back and check out yesterday's, or\n\n138\n00:08:06.518 --> 00:08:09.010\nthe previous episode,\nand watch that again.\n\n139\n00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.940\nHeck, watch it several times,\nit was a very good episode.\n\n140\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:12.931\nNext thing I think, Sean,\n\n141\n00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:15.270\nwe wanna talk about is some of\nthe limitations of cryptography.\n\n142\n00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.802\nBecause there are some,\nit's not the end all.\n\n143\n00:08:17.802 --> 00:08:20.838\nThere are some things that we have to\nworry about when we're dealing with\n\n144\n00:08:20.838 --> 00:08:23.536\ncryptography and\nchoosing our different algorithms, right?\n\n145\n00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:28.371\n>> Yes, you do have to be concerned about\na few things when you use cryptography or\n\n146\n00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:31.420\nknow what cryptography can and cannot do.\n\n147\n00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:36.800\nThat is a big mistake that is made,\nis that cryptography is,\n\n148\n00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.520\nhey, cryptography, it's kind of like the\nmagic wand that can solve a lot of things.\n\n149\n00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.420\nJust by you shoehorning in\nan algorithm into your solution,\n\n150\n00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.770\nall of a sudden you've just bulletproofed\nthings, and that's just not the case.\n\n151\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.930\n>> We had a great example of that\nin yesterday's episode again.\n\n152\n00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.190\nWe mentioned that whole smart-grid thing.\n\n153\n00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.862\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n154\n00:08:55.862 --> 00:08:58.255\n>> And I was reading through that\narticle one more time last night.\n\n155\n00:08:58.255 --> 00:09:02.045\nAnd the fact these guys decided, oh,\nwe're not gonna use a tried and true and\n\n156\n00:09:02.045 --> 00:09:06.120\ntested encryption algorithm,\nwe're just gonna come up with our own.\n\n157\n00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.840\nAnd now it's been in place for a couple\nyears, there's devices out there with it.\n\n158\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.230\nAnd guess what?\n\n159\n00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.081\nMajor, major vulnerabilities found\nin that encryption algorithm.\n\n160\n00:09:15.081 --> 00:09:17.733\nAnd so they're basically having\nto redo everything cuz they\n\n161\n00:09:17.733 --> 00:09:18.251\ndecided-\n>> Oops.\n\n162\n00:09:18.251 --> 00:09:19.390\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, right, and so\n\n163\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.416\ninstead of using something that\nwas tested and known good,\n\n164\n00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:25.790\nthey came up with their own,\nand it wasn't so good.\n\n165\n00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.690\nAnd so that's one of the things\nyou mentioned yesterday is\n\n166\n00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.280\nit's really important to use an encryption\nalgorithm that we know has been tested,\n\n167\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.230\nrun through its paces, and\nis known to be relatively invulnerable.\n\n168\n00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.406\n>> Yeah, that's the important thing.\n\n169\n00:09:41.406 --> 00:09:46.785\nIt's an interesting fact about\nthis is that, on average,\n\n170\n00:09:46.785 --> 00:09:52.380\nhow long does it take an algorithm\nto be considered grown up and\n\n171\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.546\nmature to the point where\npeople think it's reliable and\n\n172\n00:09:57.546 --> 00:10:01.870\nare going to use it,\nand be confident at it.\n\n173\n00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.880\nIt usually, on average, takes about\nseven years if you can believe.\n\n174\n00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.410\nIt takes about around that range, about\nseven years, for it to be out there and\n\n175\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.740\nbe used for\nthe community at large to say, okay yes,\n\n176\n00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.410\nit's been put through its paces, it's been\nreviewed, it's had its mettle tested.\n\n177\n00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.670\nSo, okay,\nwe can really start working with this.\n\n178\n00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.645\nThat's an important thing.\n\n179\n00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:27.690\nWe don't just want to go throw something\nout there that's as complex as\n\n180\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.370\ncryptographic algorithm and say,\nhey, lock and load, go for it.\n\n181\n00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.025\nThat would be a bad situation.\n\n182\n00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:37.276\nSo, that's something you\nalso have to be aware of.\n\n183\n00:10:37.276 --> 00:10:41.535\nAnd making one up on your own, yeah,\nI was mentioning that yesterday, and yeah,\n\n184\n00:10:41.535 --> 00:10:42.855\nI hadn't read that far.\n\n185\n00:10:42.855 --> 00:10:46.457\nI'm glad you pointed that out because\nit just reinforces that statement,\n\n186\n00:10:46.457 --> 00:10:50.927\ndon't go making this stuff up,\nit's a lot more than that.\n\n187\n00:10:52.127 --> 00:10:56.617\nIt's funny, you hear a lot of kids that\nmake up their secret languages for\n\n188\n00:10:56.617 --> 00:10:58.833\ntheir friends and stuff like that.\n\n189\n00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:00.714\nFine, you want to make up\nyour own algorithm and\n\n190\n00:11:00.714 --> 00:11:03.032\ndo something like that with it,\nI don't care, go ahead.\n\n191\n00:11:03.032 --> 00:11:07.533\nBut I don't want to trust my personal\ndata on it, or my safety on that.\n\n192\n00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:12.370\nThat's just not the way\nI want to play things.\n\n193\n00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.510\nAnd then you can also say, on top of that,\n\n194\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:21.450\nthere's the misapplication of\nalgorithms that happens all the time.\n\n195\n00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.910\nWe cited WEP yesterday, and\n\n196\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:29.020\nI could actually throw something\nelse in here that did occur.\n\n197\n00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.073\nIf you remember,\nyou probably don't have to remember this,\n\n198\n00:11:32.073 --> 00:11:35.020\ncould a lot of you probably\nin this situation now.\n\n199\n00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.330\nAnd you know how we have\nall of our cars now?\n\n200\n00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.494\nYou just have the key fob, and\nyou lock up the car, it's unlocked?\n\n201\n00:11:40.494 --> 00:11:41.468\n>> Yeah.\n\n202\n00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:45.800\n>> That technology, when it first came\nout on these high end luxury vehicles,\n\n203\n00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.800\nwhere it made its initial debut.\n\n204\n00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.070\nWhen it was being introduced\nthere were some discussion,\n\n205\n00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:56.830\nespecially among security experts that\nlooked at this and said, yeah, there's so\n\n206\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.860\nmany things wrong with that design.\n\n207\n00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:03.878\nYou can do that,\nthe environment you're talking about and\n\n208\n00:12:03.878 --> 00:12:07.030\nthe application, that that is workable.\n\n209\n00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:12.870\nYou can do that, but the way you are\nimplementing it, just, to be blunt, sucks.\n\n210\n00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.250\nCuz what they had is there\nwere several mistakes.\n\n211\n00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:21.770\nOne of them was, is that the key was\n56-bit that they sent back and forth.\n\n212\n00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:26.440\nA key that uniquely identified you,\nwhat the car does,\n\n213\n00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.330\nit sends out a radio signal\nin a field around the car.\n\n214\n00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.990\nAnd when you get close enough and\nit hits that key fob,\n\n215\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:39.190\nthe key fob chirps something back, and\nif the car recognizes it, it will unlock.\n\n216\n00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.940\nWell, that key was about 56-bit.\n\n217\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.060\nNow, think about it, 56-bit.\n\n218\n00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.923\n>> That's not that many possibilities.\n\n219\n00:12:45.923 --> 00:12:47.450\n>> No, yeah, there are not.\n\n220\n00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.710\nSo that's mistake number one, in fact-\n>> Break out your little palm pad and\n\n221\n00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.460\nyou could fire through all those in\na matter of an hour or so, yeah.\n\n222\n00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.536\n>> Now you know what I\ndo in my spare time.\n\n223\n00:12:55.536 --> 00:12:57.860\n>> [LAUGH] Just unlock everybody's car.\n\n224\n00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.170\nNot steal anything,\njust unlock them for them.\n\n225\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.585\n>> Oh, of course I'm stealing it,\nthat's how they learn.\n\n226\n00:13:01.585 --> 00:13:05.075\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But 56-bit, that's what DES used.\n\n227\n00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:07.266\n>> Yes.\n>> And DES was invalidated in the early\n\n228\n00:13:07.266 --> 00:13:08.500\n90s.\n\n229\n00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.680\nSo, you didn't have that technology for\ncars in the early 90s.\n\n230\n00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.840\nSo by the time, the late 90s and\n\n231\n00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.470\nearly 2000s when these cars start showing\nup on the high end models doing this,\n\n232\n00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:24.180\nit was well known that that was just\na stupid idea to use a key that short.\n\n233\n00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:30.945\nSo the car manufacturers were\nwarned on that point just alone.\n\n234\n00:13:30.945 --> 00:13:36.290\nAnd the car manufacturers kind of like,\nyeah, you're worrying too much.\n\n235\n00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.970\nNothing's gonna be exploited.\n\n236\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:44.260\nThe other recommendation was made by\nelectrical engineers and security experts\n\n237\n00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:50.180\nto say, the part of the car where it\nwas actually beaming out that signal,\n\n238\n00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.680\non most of these models was located\nsomewhere in the steering column.\n\n239\n00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:59.520\nAnd what was happening is that that\nsignal was going way, way, way too far.\n\n240\n00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.810\nI don't need to have that signal\ngo halfway across the parking lot.\n\n241\n00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.993\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I need it within about maybe six feet\n\n242\n00:14:05.993 --> 00:14:07.200\nof the car.\n\n243\n00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.180\nIt was an easy fix,\n\n244\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.488\nall they had to do is put a little metal\nshielding around the steering column and\n\n245\n00:14:11.488 --> 00:14:15.770\nit would dampen that signal enough\nto where it would have limited it.\n\n246\n00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.790\nThey never did that either cuz they said,\noh well, for whatever reason that's gonna\n\n247\n00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.590\nbe an extra $30 that we don't wanna add on\nthe cost [LAUGH] of the car or something.\n\n248\n00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.690\nSo they didn't do that either.\n\n249\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.206\nSo they didn't implement\na stronger algorithm,\n\n250\n00:14:26.206 --> 00:14:28.860\ncuz they didn't wanna improve\nthe hardware or work on that.\n\n251\n00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.690\nThey didn't want to go through and\nre-architect the software as well.\n\n252\n00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.230\nThey also didn't wanna have\nto do this little fix,\n\n253\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.100\nbecause it was gonna add\nthe cost to the car,\n\n254\n00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.050\nand have then to delay production of it.\n\n255\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:43.240\nAnd so the end result was,\nthey actually had a kid in Eastern Europe,\n\n256\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:49.450\nhe wasn't the only one, a kid in Eastern\nEurope that took a laptop and manufactured\n\n257\n00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.230\na USB device that he could easily\njust go through and beam out a signal\n\n258\n00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.460\nfrom his notebook that would challenge\nthese key fobs that came in range.\n\n259\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:04.190\nAnd he would just do something that we did\nin our hacking class, and all that good\n\n260\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.921\nstuff, where he would just have another\nwireless adapter in monitor mode, and\n\n261\n00:15:08.921 --> 00:15:13.110\njust start sniffing the responses\nthat came back and recording them.\n\n262\n00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.790\nThen he'd just go around\nthe parking lot hitting replay and\n\n263\n00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.642\nwait until something went click,\nand get in, and drive away.\n\n264\n00:15:18.642 --> 00:15:21.174\n>> [LAUGH] Nice.\n>> That was all it took, and\n\n265\n00:15:21.174 --> 00:15:25.660\nyou figure that more\nthan one person did that.\n\n266\n00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:31.700\nYou go to places like, let's just say for\nkicks, you go to Las Vegas or\n\n267\n00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.130\nany luxury place like that,\nthat has the valet station there.\n\n268\n00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:39.131\nYou always see the people that have the\nfancy cars, oh here, park my car for me.\n\n269\n00:15:39.131 --> 00:15:41.479\nAnd then there's this booth there\nwhere they hang all the keys.\n\n270\n00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:47.484\nAll I gotta do is have maybe like a palm\npad or have a notebook in a backpack and\n\n271\n00:15:47.484 --> 00:15:49.479\njust walk by and stand there.\n\n272\n00:15:49.479 --> 00:15:52.718\nHave a smoke or something for a few\nminutes, act like I'm just hanging out.\n\n273\n00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:56.393\nAnd have it just going [SOUND] and\ncollecting all those keys off of there and\n\n274\n00:15:56.393 --> 00:15:57.607\nchallenge sequences.\n\n275\n00:15:57.607 --> 00:16:00.463\nAnd then just walk away and\nstart having fun.\n\n276\n00:16:00.463 --> 00:16:00.973\n>> Woo!\n\n277\n00:16:00.973 --> 00:16:03.120\n>> That's all it would take and\nit did happen.\n\n278\n00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.135\nThe kid in-\n>> I was going to say Risky Business\n\n279\n00:16:05.135 --> 00:16:06.149\n[LAUGH].\n\n280\n00:16:06.149 --> 00:16:09.790\n>> The kid in Eastern Europe that did it,\n15 years old.\n\n281\n00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:16.000\nAt 15 years old he had\nstolen about 350-370 cars.\n\n282\n00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.900\n>> Woo.\nNice, nice.\n\n283\n00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.260\n>> Using that method.\n\n284\n00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.490\nSo.\n\n285\n00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.270\n>> Make sure your using the proper,\nyour encryption algorithms properly.\n\n286\n00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:30.690\n>> Yeah, it's one of the prime examples\nyou can have with that and it was.\n\n287\n00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.430\nIt was people saying,\nhey we've given you this advice and\n\n288\n00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:39.410\nit was well known to you that this\nadvice was given by the community and\n\n289\n00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.530\nauto manufactures just shined it off.\n\n290\n00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.540\nIt's an example of a you can lead\na horse to water, that type of thing.\n\n291\n00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.880\nWhat could I do at that point?\n\n292\n00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.900\nI warned you.\n\n293\n00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.160\nIt's something we do within\ncomputers all the time, right?\n\n294\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.350\nI mean, when we looked at just doing\nsimple network implementation,\n\n295\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.630\nthere's rules, there's best\npractices that we should follow.\n\n296\n00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.300\nAnd when you don't follow those you're\njust opening yourself up to attacks.\n\n297\n00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.360\nSo, the same thing goes\nwith encryption and\n\n298\n00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.980\nchoosing the appropriate algorithms,\nand implementing those.\n\n299\n00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.730\nAnd if you're designing them in the way\nyou them and in the way you design the key\n\n300\n00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:15.180\nspace is we've gotta follow the proper\nprocedures and those best practices.\n\n301\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.500\nAnd listen to the advice of the experts,\nright, that have done it,\n\n302\n00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.090\nseen it, done it.\n\n303\n00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:20.340\nLike that.\n>> Yeah, you don't wanna be in\n\n304\n00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.540\nthose situations.\n\n305\n00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.840\nYou just don't.\n\n306\n00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.010\nAnd those are far from\nbeing the only ones.\n\n307\n00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.580\nWe have the same thing with RFID tags,\nand all sorts of you know,\n\n308\n00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:34.520\nother interesting technologies that have\nmade their debut over the last few years\n\n309\n00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.180\nis that you get technologies\nimplemented they just don't understand.\n\n310\n00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.750\nCryptography is definitely\nsomething people understand.\n\n311\n00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.480\nThat's why when I wrote this book,\nnot to do a plug or\n\n312\n00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.410\nanything on it, when I wrote this book,\nI targeted it for a specific audience,\n\n313\n00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.900\nto give them an understanding\nof how these things relate.\n\n314\n00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.640\nI don't need you to understand the math,\n\n315\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.350\nI just want you to understand\nwhat these implications are.\n\n316\n00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.640\nSo hopefully, maybe,\nif you do ever do have to make a choice to\n\n317\n00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.130\nevaluate an [INAUDIBLE], evaluating\na product, or implementing something.\n\n318\n00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.950\nAt least you understand, when you hear\nthese terms, what they actually mean and\n\n319\n00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.710\nwhat the impact can be.\n\n320\n00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:09.920\n>> And our disclaimer, of course,\n\n321\n00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.360\nis going to be that Sean was\nreferring to a candy cigarette.\n\n322\n00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.108\nOr a prop, he obviously isn't\npromoting smoking out there.\n\n323\n00:18:18.108 --> 00:18:22.450\n[LAUGH] So anyway, back to our\ncryptography, some other limitations,\n\n324\n00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.000\nand concealment is one that\nyou have mentioned here.\n\n325\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.060\n>> Yes, that is something that\nis a limitation of cryptography,\n\n326\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.550\nand let me explain what\nI mean by concealment.\n\n327\n00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:40.170\nAnd then you know, we can kinda see\nwhere I'm going with this whole thing.\n\n328\n00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.020\nConcealment isn't really the same as,\n\n329\n00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:49.310\nI'm not bringing the same breath as,\nencrypting something so you can't read it.\n\n330\n00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.579\nI'm saying concealment in the sense that.\n\n331\n00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.650\nCovering up any evidence\nthat you communicated.\n\n332\n00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.930\nCryptography does one of those things.\n\n333\n00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.910\nIt doesn't do the other.\n\n334\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:06.860\nJust by going through and\nencrypting something, yes,\n\n335\n00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.960\nit's gonna give you protection.\n\n336\n00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.610\nThat's what it's designed to do,\n\n337\n00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:14.580\nif course implemented correctly,\nit's gonna give you that benefit.\n\n338\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.850\nHowever if you encrypt something,\nit automatically attracts attention.\n\n339\n00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:24.720\nSo you are not, you're keeping\npeople from seeing it outright, but\n\n340\n00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.650\nyou're not keeping them from knowing\nthat you're up to something.\n\n341\n00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.610\nOr potentially up to something.\n\n342\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:34.460\nSo, encrypting something also\nincurs a higher level of risk.\n\n343\n00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.300\nThat's also why,\nto go back to the example and\n\n344\n00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:42.530\nother errors we're talking about\nhaving a longer keys, stronger keys,\n\n345\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:46.770\nstronger algorithms becomes much more\nimportant because the moment you do that,\n\n346\n00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.300\nsomeone's gonna turn their attention to,\nwhoa, what are you trying to hide?\n\n347\n00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.930\nSo think of it as that building,\nthere's so much to go into and\n\n348\n00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.140\nall the doors were unlocked, except one.\n\n349\n00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.090\nWhich one do you wanna go into as\nsoon as you find out it's locked.\n\n350\n00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.390\n>> It made me think of the safe\nyou put in your house.\n\n351\n00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.340\nWhen you put a safe in a building or\na house,\n\n352\n00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.180\nyou don't put it there in the living room\nin the corner where everybody can see\n\n353\n00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.220\nit because that's gonna draw attention\nto it in wonder what's in there, right?\n\n354\n00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.800\nWe try to conceal the safe itself.\n\n355\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.020\nYou put it behind a picture frame or\nsomewhere like that or\n\n356\n00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:20.290\nin the floor with a little fake wood\nover it or something like that.\n\n357\n00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.950\nThe safe is keeping the information safe.\n\n358\n00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.160\nThe vault is keeping information safe or\nprotected, but we wanna hide the vault\n\n359\n00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.650\nitself so they don't even know it's there,\njust another layer of security.\n\n360\n00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:38.360\n>> Yes, that's exactly right,\nbut just remember, on its own.\n\n361\n00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:43.680\nJust having cryptography\npresent is gonna be a risk and\n\n362\n00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.200\nthat's not meant to say, hey don't use it.\n\n363\n00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.830\n>> Right.\n>> Of course that\n\n364\n00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.765\nwould be dumb to even think that,\nso just stop it.\n\n365\n00:20:49.765 --> 00:20:50.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah so\n\n366\n00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:56.650\nit's something that you do need to use,\nbut you need to be aware that\n\n367\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:02.130\nas soon as cryptography makes its debut\non the stage, whatever your solution is.\n\n368\n00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:06.640\nPeople are gonna wonder if they can\nknow that you're an encryptor and\n\n369\n00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.190\ngonna wonder what it is your trying\nto hide, it's just that way.\n\n370\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.350\nYou think about like I said, locked door,\n\n371\n00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.590\nthink about the fact that you\nput a password on a phone too.\n\n372\n00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:21.270\nHow many of you had a,\nyou have like a significant other that as\n\n373\n00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.980\nsoon as you put a password on your phone\nthey're like what are you trying to hide?\n\n374\n00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.920\nNothing.\nAll of a sudden you have this big argument\n\n375\n00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.460\nover passcodes and everything like that.\n\n376\n00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.890\n>> You changed your passcode and\ndidn't tell me what it was.\n\n377\n00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.090\nWhat's going on here?\n\n378\n00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:36.890\nYeah, exactly!\n\n379\n00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.270\n>> Who are you meeting?\n\n380\n00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.240\nAnd then another one you've\ngot listed here is time.\n\n381\n00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.630\nAnother limitation on\ncryptography is time?\n\n382\n00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:47.200\n>> Yeah, this is one that you've\ngot to be aware of because it's\n\n383\n00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.820\ndefinitely going to come into play in so\nmany different places.\n\n384\n00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.160\nAnd I'll give you some\nexamples of that in a minute.\n\n385\n00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.430\nBut what when we talk about time,\nwe talk about cryptography,\n\n386\n00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.830\nit is there is a limitation with that.\n\n387\n00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:03.420\nIs that you can make a cryptographic\nsystem stronger and stronger and\n\n388\n00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:09.030\nstronger through either fine tuning\nthe algorithm or using longer keys.\n\n389\n00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.790\nAnd some algorithms, in fact a lot\nof algorithms, a lot of software,\n\n390\n00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:16.850\nwhen you choose the algorithm, that says,\nwhat length key do you want to use?\n\n391\n00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:21.560\nYou know, those of you that setup\ncertificate services in Windows, you know\n\n392\n00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.400\nthat certificate services, when you chose\na key, it says, if that algorithm you\n\n393\n00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.630\nchoose, has an option of range of keys,\nit'll say what do you want to do?\n\n394\n00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.490\nDo you want to do,\nyou know, this short, or\n\n395\n00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:31.940\ndo you want to go all\nthe way up to this one?\n\n396\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.670\nAnd it sounds like from what we\nsaid yesterday, that, oh, hey,\n\n397\n00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:41.590\nlonger key is one of the components\nof a better and stronger system.\n\n398\n00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.160\n>> Why would I not pick\nthe longest one possible?\n\n399\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.390\n>> Yeah.\n\n400\n00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.840\nIt would seem like that's the way to go.\n\n401\n00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.363\nWell, it's not the way to go.\n\n402\n00:22:49.363 --> 00:22:54.830\nYou've got to find a balance there because\nlonger keys are just one of the things\n\n403\n00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:59.440\nthat make cryptography take longer to\nprocess through the encryption process and\n\n404\n00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.940\nthe decryption process.\n\n405\n00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.830\nWith all those extra bits and combinations\nand everything that has to apply to do\n\n406\n00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:09.040\nthe transformation and everything on it,\nit's going to take longer.\n\n407\n00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.100\nNow granted, with most of today's\nsystems If you have the correct key and\n\n408\n00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:18.720\nyou're applying through that algorithm\nto that data then you're gonna,\n\n409\n00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.900\nthere's a performance difference but\nit's usually not significant.\n\n410\n00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.170\nThen there's hardware solutions of course.\n\n411\n00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:29.600\nYou got those accelerator cards for\nthings like SSL and stuff like that.\n\n412\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.270\nAnd then you even have, you know,\nboxes that can do the same thing,\n\n413\n00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.990\nthat are just dedicated to that.\n\n414\n00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:39.000\nBut there's a point, there is a point\nwhere if that key gets longer and longer\n\n415\n00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.880\nand longer, yeah presumably it gets to be\nstronger but you are gonna pay for it.\n\n416\n00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.280\nYou don't get something for nothing.\n\n417\n00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.019\nSo, you've gotta kinda find that balance.\n\n418\n00:23:49.019 --> 00:23:54.626\nSo, when you think about it, if you,\nlike HIPAA I think is one of the ones.\n\n419\n00:23:54.626 --> 00:23:58.620\nAnd anyone out there that's familiar with\nit, you can correct me if I'm wrong on it.\n\n420\n00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.180\nI think HIPAA defines a range\nof key lengths you can use.\n\n421\n00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.270\nSomewhere in there,\nit has algorithms that [INAUDIBLE],\n\n422\n00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.390\nand then key links you\ncan use those algorithms.\n\n423\n00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.860\nAnd it's saying hey, as long as you're\n\n424\n00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.160\nsomewhere on this graphic or this map-\n>> You got your minimum\n\n425\n00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.090\nkey length that we're going to allow.\n\n426\n00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.330\n>> Yeah, and they designed those to be,\n\n427\n00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.130\nwell it would be great if you\ncould use the stronger ones.\n\n428\n00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.840\nBut this is the minimum\nstrength you can use.\n\n429\n00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:27.750\nIf you can't use that and\n\n430\n00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:32.360\nyour equipment falls below that baseline\nthat it can support that, then you need\n\n431\n00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.380\nto do some remediation to bring it in the\ncompliance so you can do that otherwise.\n\n432\n00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:41.120\nYou can't play, so, you gotta kind\nof figure out what the balance is,\n\n433\n00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.240\nif they give you anything from 128 to\n4096, don't just immediately go oh yeah,\n\n434\n00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.420\nI'm going to dive right in to that pool.\n\n435\n00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:54.630\nNo, maybe 128 is too soft for you, it's\nstill workable, but it's too soft of a key\n\n436\n00:24:54.630 --> 00:25:00.490\nfor you so maybe you're going to jump over\nto 256 because that's better for you.\n\n437\n00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:01.750\nAnd you can manage that.\n\n438\n00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.980\nBut 4,096 would be so far out and\nleft field and crazy,\n\n439\n00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.920\nthat you just couldn't do it in\na reasonable amount of time.\n\n440\n00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.250\nSo, you need to be thinking about that.\n\n441\n00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:16.400\nAnd when you test out and\nimplement cryptographic algorithms.\n\n442\n00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.900\nAnd notice what I said,\nyou need to test it out.\n\n443\n00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.580\nIt's not always obvious.\n\n444\n00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:25.730\nAnd when you pick an algorithm and start\nrunning stuff through it, it's not always\n\n445\n00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:31.560\nobvious that there's a time difference or\nthat there's time being eaten up there.\n\n446\n00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.870\nYou know there's time\nbeing eaten up there.\n\n447\n00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.920\nIt's just a question of how much.\n\n448\n00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:39.290\nYou should get your algorithm,\nset up a system or application.\n\n449\n00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.250\nWhatever it is.\n\n450\n00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.930\nAnd try different volumes of data.\n\n451\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:48.000\nYou know, different sizes and\nkind of time how long it takes to do that,\n\n452\n00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.750\nbecause if you're doing lots of stuff,\nlet's say it's SSL.\n\n453\n00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:55.600\nAnd you're tuning the key lengths\neverything and algorithms,\n\n454\n00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.780\nSSL if you're somebody like Amazon,\nyou're processing so\n\n455\n00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.990\nmany of the transactions over that or\nTLS per day that\n\n456\n00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:11.350\neven a minor thing adds up to a lot of\nhours and days that is lost doing that.\n\n457\n00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.310\n>> And performance is something\nthat's very important to them.\n\n458\n00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.200\nThey don't want you coming\nto the web site and\n\n459\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.670\nhave everything be really slow and clunky.\n\n460\n00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.590\nWhen they can get away with a shorter\nkey length and make the experience\n\n461\n00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:25.940\na whole lot better, and still be\nsafe as far their encryption goes.\n\n462\n00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.860\n>> Yeah, you look at it from their side,\n\n463\n00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.240\neven experienced stuff inside\nfrom the customer standpoint.\n\n464\n00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.080\nEvery moment they're spending with\nyou is a moment they can't spend\n\n465\n00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.950\nwith someone else, to service their order.\n\n466\n00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.680\nSo they wanna be able to\njust go right through.\n\n467\n00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.870\nAnd be able to process, process, process.\n\n468\n00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.540\nAnd be able to do those servers aren't\njust taking care of your stuff.\n\n469\n00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.030\nThey're doing other stuff, too.\n\n470\n00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.700\nSo they have to optimize\nthe use of their resources.\n\n471\n00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:56.500\nAnd so you've gotta be careful\nwhen you choose algorithms and\n\n472\n00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.150\nhow you choose key links and tune them\nto get the most bang for your buck.\n\n473\n00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:04.320\nSo always do your research,\ndo your testing,\n\n474\n00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.390\nto make sure you've got the best one.\n\n475\n00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:10.010\n>> And then another limitation\nwe want to talk about is change.\n\n476\n00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.780\nBecause over time,\nalgorithms change, things like that,\n\n477\n00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.400\nis that what we're talking about here?\n\n478\n00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.880\n>> That will be one part.\n\n479\n00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.760\nThere's actually two levels to this when\nwe deal with change with algorithms.\n\n480\n00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.880\nThe first one would be yes,\n\n481\n00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.170\nalgorithms over time because of\nthe increase in computing power,\n\n482\n00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:30.800\nwhich we talked about, changes in\nstandards, I guarantee the HIPAA\n\n483\n00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.150\nstandard is gonna say in a few years\nthat algorithm is crap, get rid of it.\n\n484\n00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.846\nAnd they're gonna and\nput another one in it.\n\n485\n00:27:37.846 --> 00:27:39.330\nThat's how it's gonna work.\n\n486\n00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:44.580\nThat's something that you're gonna have to\nbe ready, have to be able to deal with.\n\n487\n00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.670\nSwapping that stuff in and\nout of your software or environment.\n\n488\n00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.770\nOther things,\nhashing is one that we haven't\n\n489\n00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.020\nfully mentioned yet, it's gonna\nbe coming up more down the road.\n\n490\n00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:01.800\nWhen you're talking about hashing,\nwe've got a prime example.\n\n491\n00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:09.610\nMD5 and the SHA family of hash algorithms,\nMD5 has already been shown to be flawed.\n\n492\n00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:12.610\nIt's been shown several\ntimes to be flawed.\n\n493\n00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:16.200\nDoes that mean all of you should\nrun out and Chicken Little it, and\n\n494\n00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.380\ngo out and change everything,\nthe sky is falling?\n\n495\n00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.220\nNo.\n\n496\n00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:24.130\nThose faults are out there but those\nfaults weren't significant enough for\n\n497\n00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.530\nthem to say, hey let's just go ahead and\n\n498\n00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:32.510\nredo everything right now because we\nhave some major, devastating thing.\n\n499\n00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.190\nWhat they're doing is they're\nsaying as we go forward,\n\n500\n00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:40.470\nwe're gonna start doing more of\nthe Shaw family than we are the MD5,\n\n501\n00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:45.030\nbut some day down the line MD5 will\nbe marginalized and then gone.\n\n502\n00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:50.000\nBut for right now just play on with it,\nand we're good.\n\n503\n00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.230\nIt wasn't significant.\n\n504\n00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:57.910\nSo one thing you need to remember\nis that things change and all that.\n\n505\n00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:02.810\nThe other thing you've got to\nremember when you talk about\n\n506\n00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:07.090\nalgorithms is the fact that\nif you encrypt something,\n\n507\n00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:13.920\njust because you encrypt something\ndoesn't mean you can't change it.\n\n508\n00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.770\nInterestingly enough, yes,\nyou can change something\n\n509\n00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:20.060\neven though it's an encrypted\nstate without ever decrypting it.\n\n510\n00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:24.300\nJust by popping a few bits around and\nstuff like that,\n\n511\n00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:28.630\nit's possible that you could alter that in\nsuch a way that the data's different but\n\n512\n00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.370\nyou never, ever decrypted it.\n\n513\n00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:36.890\nSo remember just encryption on its own\ndoes not give you the integrity benefit.\n\n514\n00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:42.250\nSo that's a very, very,\nvery important detail as part of this.\n\n515\n00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.490\nSo someone could actually change it.\n\n516\n00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:49.540\nThat's why in a lot of cases,\nlike with a IPsec, IPsec is\n\n517\n00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:55.230\none case where they not only have\nthe encryption side of it but\n\n518\n00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:57.740\nthey also have things to\npreserve the integrity.\n\n519\n00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.081\nYou'll see stuff like,\ntripled [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n520\n00:30:00.081 --> 00:30:02.370\nthen they'll say Shaw\nis right there with it.\n\n521\n00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.570\nAnd they're telling you,\nhey we're doing some combination of these.\n\n522\n00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:10.310\nOr doing something that does\nconfidentiality and the integrity part.\n\n523\n00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:14.170\nSo be prepared to look for\nthose sorts of things.\n\n524\n00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:17.780\nThose are just some of the things\nthat are limitations of cryptography.\n\n525\n00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.450\nThere's actually quite a few\nlimitations that could come into play.\n\n526\n00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.380\nThis is a very, very short list.\n\n527\n00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:29.830\nYou will see some other ones\npop up during this course.\n\n528\n00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:35.570\nOne that I mention, I'll expand upon later\non which may not be readily obvious but\n\n529\n00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:40.030\nit's something that you do need to think\nabout is, we're here filming this and\n\n530\n00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.370\ntalking about all this right\nhere in the United States.\n\n531\n00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:47.880\nIf we tried to, if we were developing\na cryptographic algorithm here,\n\n532\n00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.800\nlet's just say for\nkicks we were doing that.\n\n533\n00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:55.770\nWe could distribute it within reason\ninside the US without any restriction.\n\n534\n00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.340\nBut the moment we try to\nexport it off US shores,\n\n535\n00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:05.335\nthere's a whole bunch of legal things\nthat come into play at the federal level.\n\n536\n00:31:05.335 --> 00:31:08.040\n>> What is it, 40 bits or\nsomething like that?\n\n537\n00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:08.940\nIs it close to that?\n\n538\n00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.080\n>> They've changed it.\n\n539\n00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:10.880\n>> Have they?\n\n540\n00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.270\n>> Yeah, they changed it, but\nthere's still some restrictions.\n\n541\n00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:18.220\nThen there's places where you even\nthink about sending it there,\n\n542\n00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:23.180\nyou're gonna have a really\nbad day very quickly.\n\n543\n00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.680\nAnd because, believe it or not,\n\n544\n00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.625\nhere in the US exporting, cryptographic\ntechnology is put in the same\n\n545\n00:31:31.625 --> 00:31:35.910\nbody of law that exporting weapons\nwould be, physical weapons, you know?\n\n546\n00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:36.845\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If you're gonna export,\n\n547\n00:31:36.845 --> 00:31:39.315\nyou know, you know stuff like,\nyou know, rifles.\n\n548\n00:31:39.315 --> 00:31:41.155\n>> Right.\n>> And explosives and stuff like that,\n\n549\n00:31:41.155 --> 00:31:42.935\nit's the exact same thing.\n\n550\n00:31:42.935 --> 00:31:47.625\nYou have to have permission from the State\nDepartment to actually export some of\n\n551\n00:31:47.625 --> 00:31:48.539\nthese things.\n\n552\n00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:50.334\nYou try exporting one of these and\n\n553\n00:31:50.334 --> 00:31:54.000\nexpect a no knock warrant from\nthe Department of Homeland Defense.\n\n554\n00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.360\n>> Exactly.\n\n555\n00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.905\n>> DHS is gonna be at your door.\n\n556\n00:31:56.905 --> 00:31:58.350\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n557\n00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:00.890\nThey do not mess around with those things.\n\n558\n00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:08.110\nThey come down pretty hard on\npeople that run afoul of that law.\n\n559\n00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.160\nThey don't even do it.\n\n560\n00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.730\nHeck, it scared Microsoft and\nmade them do, I shouldn't say scared,\n\n561\n00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.100\nprobably too strong of a word, but.\n\n562\n00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:20.850\n>> Worried, maybe?\n\n563\n00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:26.180\n>> Yeah, it got them really worried,\nand they were really careful with it.\n\n564\n00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:31.130\nThose of you that were in\nthe IT field way back In\n\n565\n00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:36.660\nthe NT 4 days, in the early Windows\n2000 days is about where it changed,\n\n566\n00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:41.460\nyou may remember that with service packs,\n\n567\n00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:47.350\nthere was a service pack, and\nthere was a high security service pack.\n\n568\n00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.080\nRemember those?\n\n569\n00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:48.750\n>> Yes.\n\n570\n00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:52.380\n>> The high security service pack,\nyou had to be here in the US to use or\n\n571\n00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:56.210\nan ally that was approved to use it,\nbecause without that high,\n\n572\n00:32:56.210 --> 00:33:01.010\nif you were just a regular service pack,\nthat was using 56 bit encryption,\n\n573\n00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:04.880\nthe other one, the high security\nwas able to use 128 bit, but\n\n574\n00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:11.010\nbecause of export laws,\nyou couldn't send it outside the country.\n\n575\n00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.270\nSo that's how they had to do it.\n\n576\n00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:15.404\nWhen the laws changed,\n\n577\n00:33:15.404 --> 00:33:19.960\nyou saw that situation dissolve.\n\n578\n00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:24.230\nBut yeah, cryptography is\nstill classified as munitions,\n\n579\n00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.470\nit's been changed, you're right.\n\n580\n00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:32.630\nIt has been changed, but there still are\ncertain countries in certain areas that\n\n581\n00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:38.780\nif your cryptographic technology shows up\nthere, it's gonna hurt real bad for you.\n\n582\n00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.110\nYou're gonna have a bad time.\n\n583\n00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:42.620\nSo, yeah.\n\n584\n00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:43.910\nJust don't do it, just in case.\n\n585\n00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:44.710\nYeah, be very careful.\n\n586\n00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:47.390\n>> All right, well tell you what, ladies\nand gentlemen, it's just about time for\n\n587\n00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.330\nus to take a break, so\nwe're gonna step away for a minute.\n\n588\n00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.700\nWhen we come back more on cryptography.\n\n589\n00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.609\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n590\n00:33:53.609 --> 00:33:57.928\n[MUSIC]\n\n591\n00:34:00.203 --> 00:34:02.480\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n592\n00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.680\nSo we've been talking about our\ndifferent components of cryptography.\n\n593\n00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.370\nAnd Sean, I think we wanna maybe\nhave a little bit of fun with our\n\n594\n00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:09.670\naudience at this point.\n\n595\n00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.915\n>> Yeah,\nwe wanna mess with you guys a bit.\n\n596\n00:34:11.915 --> 00:34:16.234\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what we want to do is just to give\n\n597\n00:34:16.234 --> 00:34:21.624\nyou some hands on with this, and\ngo through some of this stuff is,\n\n598\n00:34:21.624 --> 00:34:26.625\nwe're gonna have you do a little\nencryption practice here.\n\n599\n00:34:26.625 --> 00:34:27.206\n>> Woo-hoo!\n\n600\n00:34:27.206 --> 00:34:30.710\n>> Yeah, it's always fun, right?\n\n601\n00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.625\nWe're gonna let the home\naudience play along.\n\n602\n00:34:32.625 --> 00:34:36.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What we're gonna use,\n\n603\n00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.090\nwe're gonna start off simple.\n\n604\n00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:41.690\nWhen we go through this during the week,\n\n605\n00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:44.430\nit's going to become more complex and\nstuff like that.\n\n606\n00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:48.591\nThis is just to get you all nice and\nstretched and limbered up.\n\n607\n00:34:48.591 --> 00:34:50.944\n>> [LAUGH] A little mental exercise right?\n\n608\n00:34:50.944 --> 00:34:52.905\nTo get us ready for what's to come?\n\n609\n00:34:52.905 --> 00:35:00.165\n>> Yeah, that's exactly it, so\nyou're invited to play along with this.\n\n610\n00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:05.655\nWhat we're gonna do,\nis do a couple, maybe three,\n\n611\n00:35:07.035 --> 00:35:12.465\nencryptions using the Caesar\ncipher to make sure that you\n\n612\n00:35:12.465 --> 00:35:17.940\nkind of got a feel for what that is,\nand can go ahead and do it.\n\n613\n00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:23.500\nSo remember, caesar cipher,\nit's one of the simplest ones out there.\n\n614\n00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.270\nIt is just a simple key shift.\n\n615\n00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.690\nIt is something that we\ncall a substitution cypher,\n\n616\n00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:33.320\nbecause you're creating a pseudo alphabet.\n\n617\n00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:39.120\nOr it sometimes called the crypto\nalphabet that you will take your\n\n618\n00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.560\nunencrypted plain text character and\nreplace it with a character\n\n619\n00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.590\nthat is some spots over, and\nshifts it some number of spots.\n\n620\n00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:55.320\nAnd if you call Caesar, the Caesar\ncipher is simple because O uses three.\n\n621\n00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:01.380\nIf someone asks you Caesar cipher,\nif they apply that term to it,\n\n622\n00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.290\nit always has to be if you're\ngoing to play by the rules,\n\n623\n00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.280\nits always gonna be a key shift of three.\n\n624\n00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.580\nIf you just say it's gonna be something\nthat's like the Caesar cipher, or\n\n625\n00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:16.330\nit's using the key shift,\nthen different shifts come into play.\n\n626\n00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:20.820\n>> The three is really the key, and\nCaesar cipher always uses the same key.\n\n627\n00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.380\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n628\n00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.100\nAlways uses it.\n\n629\n00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:26.360\nAnd that implementation that they\nnamed after him always used three.\n\n630\n00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:33.550\nThe other ones that are variations of it,\nROT13 is the exact same technique but\n\n631\n00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:40.300\nnow they're using a 13-space key shift\nover the three that Caesar used.\n\n632\n00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.840\nBut if you're talking about just key\nshifting or an algorithm like this, or\n\n633\n00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:49.180\na process like this, without specifically\ndefining it as Caesar cypher,\n\n634\n00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.220\nor ROT13,\nit could be any key shift you want.\n\n635\n00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.550\nThat is valid.\n\n636\n00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.170\nThat's the long and short of it.\n\n637\n00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:01.420\nSo interestingly enough,\nwhenever you talk about ROT13,\n\n638\n00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:09.730\nit kind of has a little bit of an\ninteresting history to it along the way.\n\n639\n00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:14.420\nIf you go back far enough and some of\nour audience they'll go back this far.\n\n640\n00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.250\nRemember the old BBS systems?\n\n641\n00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.550\nYou know, you dial up with the modem and\nall of that?\n\n642\n00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:22.835\nYou know, those old BBS systems,\nso the early days,\n\n643\n00:37:22.835 --> 00:37:28.350\nand people would post on those\nlittle discussion groups on there.\n\n644\n00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:33.680\nAnd they would post various messages,\npost where to download doom from on that.\n\n645\n00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.098\n>> Right?\n[INAUDIBLE] put that up there and\n\n646\n00:37:35.098 --> 00:37:37.092\nplaying tags, right,\ncuz you can get in trouble for that?\n\n647\n00:37:37.092 --> 00:37:41.881\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n648\n00:37:41.881 --> 00:37:46.840\nBut people would occasionally post,\njust like they do nowadays they'd post\n\n649\n00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:51.870\ndirty jokes and stuff that was maybe\nquestionable or vulgar or stuff like that.\n\n650\n00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:55.130\nBut in some sort of joke like that or\ncomment,\n\n651\n00:37:55.130 --> 00:38:00.260\nto keep people from\njust stumbling onto it.\n\n652\n00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.550\nGoing, oh, what the heck?\n\n653\n00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:06.560\nWhat they did is on those groups they\nwould say that this was encrypted using\n\n654\n00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:12.320\nROT13, so you'd see a bunch of weird stuff\nsitting out there that was encrypted,\n\n655\n00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.780\nthe cypher text.\n\n656\n00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.110\nThey did that, it was open to everybody.\n\n657\n00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:19.450\nYou'd see it, but\nit was their way of saying, hey,\n\n658\n00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:23.890\nif you see something that's\nencrypted using this,\n\n659\n00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:28.910\nit means or it's a dirty joke or something\nthat you could find objectionable.\n\n660\n00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:34.470\nSo if you're somebody that's easily\noffended, don't reverse this.\n\n661\n00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:38.010\nEven though all the instructions\nare all up here how to reverse it,\n\n662\n00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:39.490\ndon't reverse it.\n\n663\n00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.640\nThey said just continue\non to the other stuff.\n\n664\n00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.890\nThat was like a little\nsafeguard they put in.\n\n665\n00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.790\nEasy safeguard, but\n>> It kinda reminds me, so\n\n666\n00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:50.502\nthat's their little black bar that\nthey would put over certain areas,\n\n667\n00:38:50.502 --> 00:38:51.425\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n668\n00:38:51.425 --> 00:38:52.720\n>> To keep them from being seen, right?\n\n669\n00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.330\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n670\n00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.270\nYeah.\nThat was their version of it.\n\n671\n00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.820\n>> That was their censorship.\n\n672\n00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.511\n>> Yeah.\nBut that was where a lot of people may\n\n673\n00:39:00.511 --> 00:39:02.980\nhave heard of it first was ROT13.\n\n674\n00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.570\nIt was in use before that.\n\n675\n00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:11.060\nBut that's where it really got kind of\na bump in the so called modern age.\n\n676\n00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.940\nYou'd see these things on these groups and\n\n677\n00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.700\nit's like well that\ndoesn't look like English.\n\n678\n00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:15.780\nThat's really weird.\n\n679\n00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.020\nAnd that's because it's a dirty\njoke that someone's making or\n\n680\n00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.550\nsomething there that they think\nsome people may be offended by.\n\n681\n00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:25.050\nWe're going to encrypt using ROT13.\n\n682\n00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:29.870\nHey, you decrypt it,\nyou did something actively to decrypt it,\n\n683\n00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:33.070\nso don't blame me if you\nget a little upset with it.\n\n684\n00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.840\nSo a little interesting thing,\nI always found it a little humorous\n\n685\n00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.835\nthat you would that people\nwould do that sort of thing.\n\n686\n00:39:39.835 --> 00:39:42.390\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nwhat do we want to try to do.\n\n687\n00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.867\nWe are talking about using the Caesar\ncypher so we need to give them,\n\n688\n00:39:45.867 --> 00:39:49.832\ndo you want to give them something in\nplain text and have them Return the cipher\n\n689\n00:39:49.832 --> 00:39:52.683\ntext to us, or do you wanna-\n>> Yeah, let's start with some plain text.\n\n690\n00:39:52.683 --> 00:39:53.236\n>> Okay.\n\n691\n00:39:53.236 --> 00:39:54.879\n>> We'll make it easy on you.\n\n692\n00:39:54.879 --> 00:39:55.382\n>> All right.\n\n693\n00:39:55.382 --> 00:39:59.820\n>> So plain text, just a simple message.\n\n694\n00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.320\nWe can use something simple.\n\n695\n00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.537\nDid you choose a keyword or-\n>> No, not really.\n\n696\n00:40:04.537 --> 00:40:05.837\n>> Surprise me [LAUGH].\n\n697\n00:40:05.837 --> 00:40:09.350\n>> Let's see, let's just do the work\ncryptography to start off with.\n\n698\n00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:10.530\nThat's pretty easy, right?\n\n699\n00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:11.330\n>> Yep.\n\n700\n00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:16.930\n>> You'll recall that what we're gonna do\nis, we're gonna take our plain text and\n\n701\n00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:22.020\nthen we're gonna find if we're gonna use\nthe Caesar cipher, we're gonna use that\n\n702\n00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:28.010\nkey of three to encode\neach one of these letters.\n\n703\n00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.940\nAnd you can choose if you want it to\nconvert the letters to their numeric\n\n704\n00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:36.750\nequivalent and add, or if you just\nwanna go a b, do a song in your head or\n\n705\n00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:39.370\nwhatever [LAUGH] to remember it.\n\n706\n00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.008\n>> And no cheating.\n\n707\n00:40:40.008 --> 00:40:43.110\nNo using of any web page to go and\npop your text in there and\n\n708\n00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:44.780\nget your cipher text back.\n\n709\n00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.189\nIt's a simple Caesar cipher,\nladies and gentlemen, so\n\n710\n00:40:48.189 --> 00:40:53.090\nyake a minute, try to encrypt the word\ncryptography using the Caesar cipher, and\n\n711\n00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:56.190\nthen pop your answers\nthere in the chatroom.\n\n712\n00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:59.040\nAnd then once we get a couple answers,\nI'll pull it up on my screen, and\n\n713\n00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.410\nwe'll go through the process so\n\n714\n00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:05.240\nthat those of you watching\nthe recording can play along as well.\n\n715\n00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.039\nSo we'll give them a few\nminutes to deal with that.\n\n716\n00:41:08.039 --> 00:41:11.494\nCouple minutes and\nwhile we're waiting on that,\n\n717\n00:41:11.494 --> 00:41:15.040\nlet's talk about what makes\na good crypto system.\n\n718\n00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.361\n>> What makes a good crypto system.\n\n719\n00:41:16.361 --> 00:41:21.155\nFirst, probably before we even say\nwhat makes a good crypto system,\n\n720\n00:41:21.155 --> 00:41:25.390\nwe probably should really\nexplain what a cryptosystem is.\n\n721\n00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:26.370\n>> Yes.\n>> You may already know,\n\n722\n00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:30.810\nbut we'll go ahead and we'll expand\non that just to make sure again,\n\n723\n00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.180\nwe're all on the same page here.\n\n724\n00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.900\nA cryptosystem is something that\nincludes a number of things.\n\n725\n00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:41.470\nIt's not just the algorithm,\nit's also the management and all that,\n\n726\n00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:42.610\nthat goes around with that.\n\n727\n00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:45.110\nYou're talking key management techniques.\n\n728\n00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:48.840\nWe're talking potentially\nintegration with other\n\n729\n00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:53.770\ncryptographic technologies and\npolicies and stuff like that.\n\n730\n00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:58.150\nOne cryptosystem we could point\nto would be the system of PKI,\n\n731\n00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:59.720\nPublic Key Infrastructure.\n\n732\n00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.900\nThat would be something that's defined\nas a whole ecosystem as a cryptosystem.\n\n733\n00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.773\nBecause there's not just one thing there.\n\n734\n00:42:06.773 --> 00:42:13.589\nThere's algorithms in place there for\nvarious things.\n\n735\n00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:15.160\n>> It deals with the entire process,\nright?\n\n736\n00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.710\nAll the way from generating\nthe keys in the first place,\n\n737\n00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:21.810\nto issuing the keys out to users or\ndevices or software,\n\n738\n00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:24.360\nto managing those keys\nthroughout their lifetime,\n\n739\n00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.110\nto expiring those certificates and those\nkeys when they're not necessary anymore.\n\n740\n00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:31.750\nRevoking them if they\nhave been compromised.\n\n741\n00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.290\nSo when you say cryptosystem,\n\n742\n00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:37.870\nit's something that deals with that\nentire process, not just the algorithm.\n\n743\n00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:40.480\n>> Yeah, it's not just the algorithm.\n\n744\n00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:44.460\nI mean, sometimes they do say it's just\nthe algorithm, if you start factoring in\n\n745\n00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.990\nthe key management part of it and\nsome of the other stuff.\n\n746\n00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.080\nBut typically it's gonna be,\n\n747\n00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:54.690\nit's when we start rolling a bunch of\nthings together to make a solution.\n\n748\n00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:58.120\nThat's when we start saying, okay,\ntime to put the big boy pants on and\n\n749\n00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.810\ncall it a crypto system.\n\n750\n00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.150\nSo that's what it is.\n\n751\n00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:05.320\nThere's tons of cryptosystems out\nthere in all different forms,\n\n752\n00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.870\nthere's not just one out there.\n\n753\n00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:09.600\nYou could point to several cases.\n\n754\n00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.261\nWhere you have a crypto system,\nwith several things working together and\n\n755\n00:43:13.261 --> 00:43:15.160\nbeing integrated in to other things.\n\n756\n00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:20.074\nSo that's what a cryptosystem is,\nso we got to expand on that and\n\n757\n00:43:20.074 --> 00:43:25.898\nwhat makes a good cryptosystem now,\nbecause just having some good things or\n\n758\n00:43:25.898 --> 00:43:28.992\na good algorithm isn't really enough,\n\n759\n00:43:28.992 --> 00:43:33.180\nespecially when you start\nfactoring in other things.\n\n760\n00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.690\nIt depends on and the stuff around it.\n\n761\n00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:37.210\nYou could actually, for example,\n\n762\n00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:43.390\nyou could have an algorithm\nthat's the best thing going.\n\n763\n00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:48.270\nLet's just say somehow you've stumbled on\nthe mother of all algorithms out there.\n\n764\n00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.470\nThere's nothing better.\n\n765\n00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:51.380\nOkay, great.\n\n766\n00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.224\nYou just found that holy grail.\n\n767\n00:43:54.224 --> 00:43:58.512\nAnd what happened is, is you found out\nthat you really suck at key management.\n\n768\n00:43:58.512 --> 00:44:03.179\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so that's not good, so if you're\n\n769\n00:44:03.179 --> 00:44:08.790\nlike, hey this is the best\ncryptosystem ever.\n\n770\n00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:11.172\nAnd then all of a sudden, okay here.\n\n771\n00:44:11.172 --> 00:44:14.330\nYou're gonna use this ABC\nwhatever cryptosystem and\n\n772\n00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:15.410\nthen you pull out a piece of paper.\n\n773\n00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:16.766\nYeah, here's the key.\n\n774\n00:44:16.766 --> 00:44:17.970\nYeah, good, right.\n\n775\n00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.715\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just waved it in front of the screen\n\n776\n00:44:20.715 --> 00:44:22.499\nor something, there goes that.\n\n777\n00:44:22.499 --> 00:44:27.326\n>> [LAUGH] Or are you thinking the one\ntime pad thing where you write it down\n\n778\n00:44:27.326 --> 00:44:28.697\non a piece of paper?\n\n779\n00:44:28.697 --> 00:44:31.469\nEverybody knows a little trick where you\ntake that top piece of paper off and\n\n780\n00:44:31.469 --> 00:44:33.625\nall you're left with is a pad,\nand you take your pencil and\n\n781\n00:44:33.625 --> 00:44:36.183\nyour rub it softly over there and\nyou kinda see what they wrote [LAUGH].\n\n782\n00:44:36.183 --> 00:44:38.209\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n783\n00:44:38.209 --> 00:44:41.935\n[CROSSTALK] You definitely\ncould do something like that.\n\n784\n00:44:41.935 --> 00:44:43.685\nThat would be another great example.\n\n785\n00:44:43.685 --> 00:44:45.858\nAnd people have done that over the years.\n\n786\n00:44:45.858 --> 00:44:48.023\n>> Just poor implementation\nof a cryptosystem, right?\n\n787\n00:44:48.023 --> 00:44:51.371\nIf you're gonna be writing on a piece of\npaper like that and tearing it off and\n\n788\n00:44:51.371 --> 00:44:53.165\nleaving that next piece of paper there.\n\n789\n00:44:53.165 --> 00:44:54.553\n>> Yeah.\n>> Maybe not a good idea [LAUGH].\n\n790\n00:44:54.553 --> 00:44:56.993\n>> You definitely need to be careful.\n\n791\n00:44:56.993 --> 00:45:01.604\nYou could point to so many things\nthrough history where people have\n\n792\n00:45:01.604 --> 00:45:05.142\nmade mistakes on something\nthat was a good system,\n\n793\n00:45:05.142 --> 00:45:09.770\nand they did something just really\nboneheaded that screwed it up.\n\n794\n00:45:10.975 --> 00:45:18.130\nOnce I used, or I talked about in our\nfirst episode and the history of it,\n\n795\n00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:24.160\nanother flaw to pick on\nin the Enigma system.\n\n796\n00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.750\nEnigma is actually it was a very,\n\n797\n00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:32.220\nvery strong system,\noverall when you look at it.\n\n798\n00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.305\nJust a very good job.\n\n799\n00:45:34.305 --> 00:45:38.300\nHowever, there were some flaws in it,\nof course.\n\n800\n00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.260\nAnd then there was also, I talk about\nthe one with the encrypting certain\n\n801\n00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.075\nletters and it didn't go the right way?\n\n802\n00:45:43.075 --> 00:45:45.240\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But then there was something else that\n\n803\n00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:51.010\npopped up that they found really,\nworked against the Germans is,\n\n804\n00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:54.210\nin some of these places where they\nwere encrypting stuff with the Enigma,\n\n805\n00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:56.100\nit was supposed to be changed every day.\n\n806\n00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.080\nThey weren't changing the keys every day,\nand\n\n807\n00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:04.430\nthen the other thing was that some of\nthem were using the names of wives and\n\n808\n00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:09.150\nmistresses and stuff like that\nas part of their code system.\n\n809\n00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.360\nAll you've got to do is\nbe near that office and\n\n810\n00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:15.770\nfind out who the wife or\nmistress was, and you had a key.\n\n811\n00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.480\nAnd they'd use those things too.\n\n812\n00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n813\n00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.460\nnow you have something\nthat's a good system.\n\n814\n00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:26.280\nBut, it's down risked significantly\nby someone using that same key,\n\n815\n00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.790\nor something that's easily obtained.\n\n816\n00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:31.140\nWhich is completely stupid.\n\n817\n00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:36.440\nAnd even if, and by the way, even if with\ncryptosystems, even if you don't obtain\n\n818\n00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:41.128\nthe key, if someone reuses a key,\nyou can compare different\n\n819\n00:46:41.128 --> 00:46:47.030\npieces of cipher text, and\nyou can obtain patterns off of that.\n\n820\n00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:52.600\nAnd that can be used to reverse things and\nextract the actual key,\n\n821\n00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.870\nand then in turn,\ndecrypt even more messages off of that.\n\n822\n00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:00.630\n>> All right, so we got to make sure\nthat our encrypted system is strong.\n\n823\n00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:01.949\nAnd then you mention reviewed.\n\n824\n00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:03.780\n>> Yeah.\n\n825\n00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:07.330\nThe reviewed is a big, important one.\n\n826\n00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:13.560\nReviewed means that it's been audited and\ndouble checked to make sure\n\n827\n00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:18.550\nthat it's up to snuff and\nit does what it's supposed to.\n\n828\n00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:20.490\nI even put the term later on here,\n\n829\n00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.480\none of the more common terms\nto hear is peer review.\n\n830\n00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.100\nWhen you're talking something\nlike this that is designed and\n\n831\n00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:33.270\nin the halls of academia or those type of\nenvironments, peer review goes a long,\n\n832\n00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:39.420\nlong way toward saying that\nyou have a weight behind you.\n\n833\n00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.370\nI mean that's for everything.\n\n834\n00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:43.045\nThat's not just with cryptographic things.\n\n835\n00:47:43.045 --> 00:47:47.069\nPeer review shows that\nsomething is up to snuff.\n\n836\n00:47:47.069 --> 00:47:50.045\n>> Cuz we're getting reviewed by\npeople that are in the know basically.\n\n837\n00:47:50.045 --> 00:47:53.160\nPeer review, indicating that\nthe people that are doing the review.\n\n838\n00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.135\nKnow about this stuff.\n\n839\n00:47:54.135 --> 00:47:58.067\nI'm not getting Joe off the street to\nexamine my encryption algorithm that I\n\n840\n00:47:58.067 --> 00:48:01.986\njust developed, cuz he's not going to\nbe able to tell me one way the other.\n\n841\n00:48:01.986 --> 00:48:08.310\n>> Yeah, it has to be somebody that's of\nthe same caliber, knows what you're doing,\n\n842\n00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:12.440\nand is able to provide\nexpert opinion on it.\n\n843\n00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.375\nYou can't have just some layperson do it,\n\n844\n00:48:14.375 --> 00:48:16.860\nbecause it's not gonna\nhold a lot of water.\n\n845\n00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:21.260\nYou know it is,\nheck it would be like you know when I,\n\n846\n00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.690\nthis cryptography book when I wrote it.\n\n847\n00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:29.312\nThe person I had review it is\nnot only a friend of mine, but\n\n848\n00:48:29.312 --> 00:48:33.410\nhe's someone that knows\ncryptography really well,\n\n849\n00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:39.870\nand everything he researched on his\nend as well when he reviewed it.\n\n850\n00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:40.950\nThat's what you want.\n\n851\n00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:48.470\nI don't want to put out something that,\nhey, I just had my girlfriend review it.\n\n852\n00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:53.200\nLike my girlfriend works in like\na college bookstore or something.\n\n853\n00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.360\nThat's not the skills that you need.\n\n854\n00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.640\nYou need something else.\n\n855\n00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.020\nIf you're not peer reviewed,\nthat could be a problem.\n\n856\n00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:05.820\nThat's also why when you were\nbringing up that open protocol for\n\n857\n00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.160\nthe meters and the power grid.\n\n858\n00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.878\nThat's one of the problems\nthat comes in with that, too.\n\n859\n00:49:09.878 --> 00:49:12.930\nNot only do you make it up on your own,\nthey made it up in house.\n\n860\n00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:17.776\nAnd I doubt they had much of a peer review\ngoing on where you had extra eyeballs\n\n861\n00:49:17.776 --> 00:49:22.000\nlooking at that, to say,\noh yeah, there's problems here.\n\n862\n00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.331\n>> Maybe could have spotted some of those\nflaws before they implemented out on all\n\n863\n00:49:25.331 --> 00:49:26.046\nthose devices.\n\n864\n00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:26.730\n>> Yeah, and\n\n865\n00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:31.880\nanybody who is doing this is going to\nbe open to doing this professionally.\n\n866\n00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:36.490\nIt's somebody that's going to do\na peer review to make sure, and\n\n867\n00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:41.490\nif you ever do get that sort of thing or\nyou see the discussions that go onto it,\n\n868\n00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:45.460\nall of them make mistakes,\nall the best cryptographers.\n\n869\n00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:49.459\nI mentioned Ron Rivest\n>> I have no business questioning\n\n870\n00:49:49.459 --> 00:49:50.540\nhis ability.\n\n871\n00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:53.650\nI'm not the same zip code, planet, galaxy,\n\n872\n00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.470\nwhatever he's in,\ndifferent person with cryptography.\n\n873\n00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:58.470\nHe makes mistakes.\n\n874\n00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:59.620\nHe had peer review.\n\n875\n00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:03.642\nHis peers were people\nthat were PhD students.\n\n876\n00:50:03.642 --> 00:50:08.495\nHe had a Master's student\nactually picked up a flaw in one\n\n877\n00:50:08.495 --> 00:50:13.050\nof his RC algorithms,\nif you can believe that.\n\n878\n00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:13.900\nThey actually found it.\n\n879\n00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.908\nI think it's RC2.\n\n880\n00:50:14.908 --> 00:50:17.585\nSomebody found a way of\nmanipulating bits and\n\n881\n00:50:17.585 --> 00:50:22.096\nfeeding certain data to it that was\nactually able to reveal a bunch of stuff,\n\n882\n00:50:22.096 --> 00:50:26.382\nand allow you to readily decrypt\nwhat was happening in that protocol.\n\n883\n00:50:26.382 --> 00:50:31.134\nA Master's student, but someone that\nhad a strong mathematics background,\n\n884\n00:50:31.134 --> 00:50:35.321\nhad been through cryptography and\ncould fit the definition of peer.\n\n885\n00:50:35.321 --> 00:50:36.925\n>> Do you think he got an A for\nthat, or did he flunk him for\n\n886\n00:50:36.925 --> 00:50:37.910\nfinding a flaw in the protocol?\n\n887\n00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:39.360\n[LAUGH].\n\n888\n00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.088\n>> [LAUGH].\nI don't know if Ron's the type who takes\n\n889\n00:50:42.088 --> 00:50:43.470\nit personally or not.\n\n890\n00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:44.060\n>> All right,\n\n891\n00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:48.420\nthen something else we talk about with\na good cryptosystem is repeatability.\n\n892\n00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:52.018\n>> Yeah, and\nthat one is really if you think about it,\n\n893\n00:50:52.018 --> 00:50:55.208\nit kinda makes sense\nwhen you think about it.\n\n894\n00:50:55.208 --> 00:50:58.047\nIt's like you don't wanna\nhave a cryptosystem or\n\n895\n00:50:58.047 --> 00:51:01.159\nalgorithm anything that you\nput something through and\n\n896\n00:51:01.159 --> 00:51:05.029\nthen put something through again\nit doesn't give the same result.\n\n897\n00:51:05.029 --> 00:51:06.892\nSo, what the hell?\n\n898\n00:51:06.892 --> 00:51:10.743\n>> [NOISE]\n>> [NOISE] That's just not a good thing at\n\n899\n00:51:10.743 --> 00:51:11.270\nall.\n\n900\n00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.296\n>> No, no.\n\n901\n00:51:12.296 --> 00:51:14.030\nThat would make it very difficult to use.\n\n902\n00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:15.280\nNot very efficient, right?\n\n903\n00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:20.540\n>> Yeah, it needs to be something\nthat's very predictable.\n\n904\n00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:25.220\nIn the sense that if you put something in,\nyou know certain\n\n905\n00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:30.150\noperations are gonna happen based\non the given key to give a result.\n\n906\n00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:32.180\nYou have to be able to do that.\n\n907\n00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:35.680\nIt can't be something that's kind of\njust kludged together someway and said,\n\n908\n00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.850\nokay, here you go, here's the algorithm.\n\n909\n00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:40.610\nAnd all of a sudden there's\ndifferent outputs coming out.\n\n910\n00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:42.418\nThere's all sorts of\nscrewy things going on.\n\n911\n00:51:42.418 --> 00:51:45.906\n>> If it was a symmetric algorithm and\nI encrypted it using a certain key, and\n\n912\n00:51:45.906 --> 00:51:49.730\nthen I tried to decrypt it with that same\nkey, and couldn't get my data back out,\n\n913\n00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:51.887\nit's not gonna do me\na whole lot of good is it?\n\n914\n00:51:51.887 --> 00:51:56.080\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's not a good thing.\n\n915\n00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.330\nI would even add on to\nthe whole repeatable thing,\n\n916\n00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:04.120\nis that when you have an algorithm,\nyes it does have to be repeatable,\n\n917\n00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:10.370\nbut also it has to be something that\nis usable by someone out in the field.\n\n918\n00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:11.480\nLet's just put it that way.\n\n919\n00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:15.300\nThe vast majority of the people that\n\n920\n00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:19.600\nwill ever touch a cryptographic algorithm\nare gonna be on the business end.\n\n921\n00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.000\nThey are the ones that\nare going to be using it.\n\n922\n00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.870\nBasically, all of us.\n\n923\n00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:27.740\nThere's probably a handful of us\neither in a discussion group or\n\n924\n00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:32.700\nwatching the recordings, what have you,\nthat have actually opened up\n\n925\n00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:37.482\nthe black box and looked at the algorithm\nand probably closed it up right away.\n\n926\n00:52:37.482 --> 00:52:38.042\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n927\n00:52:38.042 --> 00:52:40.700\nthere's probably a few\nof you have done that.\n\n928\n00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:44.380\nAnd probably even fewer still,\nif any, that actually understood it.\n\n929\n00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:47.920\nI'm not taking a shot at\nanybody at all by saying that,\n\n930\n00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.080\nbecause those things are really,\nreally kind of up there.\n\n931\n00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:56.200\nBut keep in mind, the people that use\nthis aren't gonna be those people,\n\n932\n00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.692\nit's probably gonna be people like us,\nthe average Joe.\n\n933\n00:52:59.692 --> 00:53:00.610\n>> Basically users.\n\n934\n00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.040\n>> Yeah, that's doing e-commerce.\n\n935\n00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.510\nThat's doing something like TrueCrypt or\nBitLocker or anything like that.\n\n936\n00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:09.210\n>> So if that algorithm works well on\nthe super Cray back at the university,\n\n937\n00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:13.460\nthat's one thing, but if it doesn't work\nso well on my little Linksys router,\n\n938\n00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:17.110\nor my Macbook at home, not so good.\n\n939\n00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:20.320\n>> Yeah, it's not something\nthat would be considered\n\n940\n00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:24.610\nfeasible to use in those\neveryday situations.\n\n941\n00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:31.830\nSo you need to have something that\nworks consistently, so it's repeatable,\n\n942\n00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:37.940\nand it can be used by really anybody\nthat would need to have access to that.\n\n943\n00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.460\nThat there's really not a lot of question,\n\n944\n00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:42.200\nand that they don't have to jump\nthrough a lot of hoops and all that.\n\n945\n00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.276\nYou need something that\nis gonna be workable.\n\n946\n00:53:44.276 --> 00:53:48.990\nAnd that is maybe, probably the toughest\npart if you're on the other side.\n\n947\n00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:53.780\nBecause, hey, you know, you may be a math\nwhiz and all that other good stuff, but\n\n948\n00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.850\nyou may not be good at translating\nit to masses and that's the thing.\n\n949\n00:53:57.850 --> 00:53:58.970\n>> All right, a lot of good stuff there.\n\n950\n00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:03.750\nWe gotta make sure we understand\nwhat makes a good cryptosystem.\n\n951\n00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:05.980\nLet's jump back then to\nthe beginning of this segment.\n\n952\n00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.070\nWe gave you guys a problem.\n\n953\n00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:12.800\nWe said to take the Caesar cipher and\ntrying to encrypt the word cryptography.\n\n954\n00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.640\nAnd I've got a few guesses\nthere in the chat room.\n\n955\n00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.070\nLet's break it down for them, Sean.\n\n956\n00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:20.750\nShow them how it works and so the people\nwatching the recording also get to see\n\n957\n00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:24.230\nthis and will see if anybody\nout there got it right.\n\n958\n00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:28.150\nSo if you want to pop up my screen for\nus here, I've got just the Caesar\n\n959\n00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:33.730\ncipher on a spreadsheet and I've got my\nplain text being the word cryptography.\n\n960\n00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:35.170\nSo, Sean, where do we start?\n\n961\n00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:36.950\nHow do we work this thing?\n\n962\n00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:38.260\n>> This one's simple.\n\n963\n00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:43.050\nYou've got up top you can see\nyou've nicely done it for all them.\n\n964\n00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:47.540\nYou've got your first row\nas your regular alphabet,\n\n965\n00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:49.570\nthat would be your plain text alphabet.\n\n966\n00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:52.718\nAnd then your second row,\nthat's your cipher alphabet or\n\n967\n00:54:52.718 --> 00:54:55.545\ncrypto-alphabet or pseudo-alphabet,\ndepending on what you want to call it.\n\n968\n00:54:55.545 --> 00:54:56.050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n969\n00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:58.562\n>> And so\nyou've done the key shift of three there\n\n970\n00:54:58.562 --> 00:54:59.630\n>> Exactly.\n\n971\n00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:03.040\nSo shift that over so an A then becomes D.\n\n972\n00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.590\nSo, B, C, D?\n\n973\n00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:05.500\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n974\n00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:08.790\nAnd if you just follow\nthat matrix right on down,\n\n975\n00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:14.000\nyou can see that we cryptography\nstarts with a C, so C translates to F.\n\n976\n00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.220\n>> An F.\n>> So F is our first one.\n\n977\n00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:20.190\nAnd then we go to the next one,\nbeing R, so we go down our alphabet.\n\n978\n00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:21.542\nR translates to U.\n\n979\n00:55:21.542 --> 00:55:29.300\nAnd we keep going down that until\nwe get the whole thing encrypted.\n\n980\n00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:30.910\nLet's see, so\nlet me see if I got that right.\n\n981\n00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:34.660\nSo I've got fusb outside and\nthen a t becomes a w, and\n\n982\n00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:37.120\nyou guys correct me if I\ncalled that out wrong.\n\n983\n00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.890\nAn o becomes an r.\n\n984\n00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:43.005\nA g becomes a j.\n\n985\n00:55:43.005 --> 00:55:45.045\nAn r becomes a u.\n\n986\n00:55:45.045 --> 00:55:49.779\nAn a becomes a d, lost my place.\n\n987\n00:55:49.779 --> 00:55:55.413\nA p becomes an s, an h becomes a k,\n\n988\n00:55:55.413 --> 00:55:59.450\nand then a y becomes a b.\n\n989\n00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:02.750\nHopefully, I typed all that,\nmy typing skills are not the best.\n\n990\n00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:03.420\n>> Close enough.\n\n991\n00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:04.828\n>> [LAUGH] But I think we got that.\n\n992\n00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:08.228\nAnd as Sean said, we're just basically,\nso I got the first letter was the C.\n\n993\n00:56:08.228 --> 00:56:10.896\nSo because I drew this out,\nit makes it a little bit easier.\n\n994\n00:56:10.896 --> 00:56:13.326\nAs you said, you could just\nkinda number the letters and\n\n995\n00:56:13.326 --> 00:56:16.080\nthen add three to them if you\nwanted to do it that way.\n\n996\n00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.500\nAnd that's all that's all I was doing.\n\n997\n00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:25.800\nAn R would then become a U, a Y became\na B, and so on and so on down the line.\n\n998\n00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:30.143\nAnd then there is my encrypted\nversion of that cipher.\n\n999\n00:56:30.143 --> 00:56:30.791\n>> Yes.\n>> And\n\n1000\n00:56:30.791 --> 00:56:35.580\nlet's see, I think a couple of you guys,\nW-U-S-W-R-J-U-D-S-P.\n\n1001\n00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:41.480\nAnd yes, I think a few of you guys\ngot that right out there in TV land.\n\n1002\n00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:45.310\nAnd hopefully you guys doing the recording\nwere able to figure that one out as well.\n\n1003\n00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:49.580\nSo pretty straight forward there,\njust shifting everything over by three.\n\n1004\n00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:53.017\nAnd just the opposite to get\nthe plain text back out, right?\n\n1005\n00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:55.240\n>> Yep, that's it.\n\n1006\n00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.556\nAll you'd have to do is just,\nif you receive that ciphertext, and\n\n1007\n00:56:58.556 --> 00:57:03.080\nsomeone whispered in your ear or whatever,\nI used the Caesar cipher for that, or\n\n1008\n00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:09.170\nyou had prior knowledge of it, if they're\nspecifically meaning the Caesar cipher,\n\n1009\n00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:11.230\nit's gonna be that key shift of three.\n\n1010\n00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:13.050\nSo you know what to do at this point.\n\n1011\n00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:17.410\nYou got the ciphertext, you know\nit went three spaces to the right,\n\n1012\n00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:18.950\nit's gonna be three spaces to the left.\n\n1013\n00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:22.220\nI mean,\nit doesn't get any simpler than that.\n\n1014\n00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.480\n>> I could kind of cheat and\njust use the same table, and\n\n1015\n00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.110\njust start now with the bottom\nrow as my ciphertext.\n\n1016\n00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:30.380\nThe top row would be my plain text,\nso I can just take that F and say,\n\n1017\n00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:34.880\nall right F then turns back into a C,\nand I can continue down the line.\n\n1018\n00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:36.090\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1019\n00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:37.080\nThat's it.\n\n1020\n00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:37.760\n>> Easy enough.\n\n1021\n00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.800\nIt's funny to think that this was\na very powerful encryption algorithm\n\n1022\n00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.840\nback in the days of Julius Caesar,\nbut it was.\n\n1023\n00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:50.350\nTo us, it seems very simple, but\nback then they didn't have Sean's\n\n1024\n00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:53.610\nbook on cryptography, so this wasn't\nsomething that was known to everybody.\n\n1025\n00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:55.210\n>> That's why the Roman Empire fell.\n\n1026\n00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:55.815\n>> Pick up my book.\n\n1027\n00:57:55.815 --> 00:57:58.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Better coding systems, I'm just saying.\n\n1028\n00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:59.997\n>> You could have saved them all.\n\n1029\n00:57:59.997 --> 00:58:02.584\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and I'm really humble about it.\n\n1030\n00:58:02.584 --> 00:58:05.707\nI'm serious.\n>> You're the reason we're not speaking\n\n1031\n00:58:05.707 --> 00:58:06.836\nLatin today.\n\n1032\n00:58:06.836 --> 00:58:08.263\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1033\n00:58:08.263 --> 00:58:08.860\n>> All right.\n\n1034\n00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:14.070\n>> And I agree with you, it's fascinating\nthat that cipher at that time,\n\n1035\n00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:18.200\nor that algorithm at the time was,\neven though it was very simplistic by\n\n1036\n00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:23.700\ntoday's standards,\nit still went a long, long way.\n\n1037\n00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:26.430\nIt had a long lifetime.\n\n1038\n00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:29.540\nIt wasn't just used by Caesar.\n\n1039\n00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:34.770\nHe used it and\nstandardized his version on three, but\n\n1040\n00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:40.380\nthen there were other later ones,\ncommanders of his and all that,\n\n1041\n00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:47.400\nthat followed the same type of thing\nlater on down the road after he was gone.\n\n1042\n00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:50.850\nSo it was used for\na substantial period of time.\n\n1043\n00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:53.010\nAnd then other people used key shifts.\n\n1044\n00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:54.830\n>> Right.\n>> But there was a point in time,\n\n1045\n00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:58.456\nas we're gonna talk about in a future\nsegment, there was a point in time where\n\n1046\n00:58:58.456 --> 00:59:03.340\nsomeone realized, yeah,\nyou can decode this pretty easily.\n\n1047\n00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:07.720\n>> And I think you mentioned it the other\nday, one of the things that really helped\n\n1048\n00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:13.130\nthis algorithm out was the literacy\nrate back then was not all that great.\n\n1049\n00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:16.440\nSo most of the people had trouble\nreading in the first place,\n\n1050\n00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:20.260\njust your well- educated people,\nthe wealthier people, maybe.\n\n1051\n00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:23.860\nAnd if you pull up my screen one\nmore time and you look at that\n\n1052\n00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:28.620\nciphertext that popped out of this,\nit looks like gobbledygook.\n\n1053\n00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:31.150\nAnd if you're not a great reader,\n\n1054\n00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:36.450\nif you're illiterate as it is,\nthat's gonna be impossible.\n\n1055\n00:59:36.450 --> 00:59:38.930\nYou couldn't even figure out how\nto try to reverse that back out.\n\n1056\n00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:44.360\nBut then as you said, as people became\nmore educated, literacy rates started\n\n1057\n00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:49.080\ngoing up, and that became pretty simple\nto figure out, so they just modified it.\n\n1058\n00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:52.030\nThey did a few tweaks to that algorithm,\nand\n\n1059\n00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:55.730\ncame up with some new ways of doing it,\nwhich we're gonna take a look at as well.\n\n1060\n00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:56.910\n>> It's always evolving.\n\n1061\n00:59:56.910 --> 01:00:00.700\nAt the time, that was considered, heck,\n\n1062\n01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:04.386\nwe could say that was\nconsidered state of the art.\n\n1063\n01:00:04.386 --> 01:00:06.125\n>> That was the ES256 for the day.\n\n1064\n01:00:06.125 --> 01:00:06.900\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1065\n01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.340\nthat would be the equivalent of that.\n\n1066\n01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:10.710\nNowadays, your computer's not\neven thinking about that,\n\n1067\n01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:12.520\nit's not even breaking a sweat.\n\n1068\n01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:17.080\nSo it worked very effectively, for\nall the reasons that were just stated.\n\n1069\n01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:24.720\nLiteracy rates and probably the arrogance\nof hey, well that's some other language.\n\n1070\n01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.020\nIf you understood what those\nletters were it was still, oh,\n\n1071\n01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.642\nsome barbarian's doing this.\n\n1072\n01:00:29.642 --> 01:00:30.520\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1073\n01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.320\n>> Whatever, and you get chucked,\nit's garbage or whatever.\n\n1074\n01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.441\nSo it was-\n>> It just looked like chicken scratch,\n\n1075\n01:00:35.441 --> 01:00:38.210\nlike somebody that was trying to\nwrite that didn't know what the heck\n\n1076\n01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:38.970\nthey were doing.\n\n1077\n01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:43.580\n>> Yeah, that's exactly right,\nso this worked very well.\n\n1078\n01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.120\nBut yeah, once, after a period of time and\n\n1079\n01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.730\npeople started figuring it out\njust what the trick was to it,\n\n1080\n01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:54.490\nthen it just became easier and\neasier to break it so, of course,\n\n1081\n01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:59.590\nthey had to kind of up the standards to\nthe whole thing, and go to another level.\n\n1082\n01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:04.630\nAnd they found some very clever ways\nof enhancing that algorithm and going\n\n1083\n01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:09.720\ndifferent directions to get something\nthat was, indeed, stronger than that.\n\n1084\n01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:16.000\nBut you will still see the basis of the\nkey shifting part, of the Caesar cipher,\n\n1085\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.823\nyou will actually see it embedded in\nsome of the modern day algorithms.\n\n1086\n01:01:20.823 --> 01:01:21.417\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1087\n01:01:21.417 --> 01:01:25.100\nAnd that's an interesting one,\nso don't think it went away.\n\n1088\n01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:28.982\nIt's just something that got,\ninstead of being used on it's own,\n\n1089\n01:01:28.982 --> 01:01:31.960\nit got embedded inside of other stuff,\nand then combined.\n\n1090\n01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:36.929\nSo, now you have something that each\nindividual piece may be really poor\n\n1091\n01:01:36.929 --> 01:01:39.779\non it's own, but when you combine them,\n\n1092\n01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:44.192\nnow you get something that's\ngreater than the sum of its parts.\n\n1093\n01:01:44.192 --> 01:01:45.630\n>> Nice.\n>> So do remember that.\n\n1094\n01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:48.970\nThis is not something that's like,\noh, well we're doing it for nothing.\n\n1095\n01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:50.666\nNo, there is still uses for this.\n\n1096\n01:01:50.666 --> 01:01:51.384\nVery good.\n\n1097\n01:01:51.384 --> 01:01:54.425\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nlooking at the clock it's about time for\n\n1098\n01:01:54.425 --> 01:01:55.025\nus to take a break.\n\n1099\n01:01:55.025 --> 01:01:56.495\nSo we're gonna step away for a minute.\n\n1100\n01:01:56.495 --> 01:01:59.225\nBut don't go away, when we come back,\nmore cryptography.\n\n1101\n01:01:59.225 --> 01:02:03.285\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1102\n01:02:03.285 --> 01:02:10.565\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n1103\n01:02:10.565 --> 01:02:13.892\nSo continuing on with our\ncomponents of cryptography,\n\n1104\n01:02:13.892 --> 01:02:18.460\nwe've got another little exercise we\nwant to give everybody, right Sean?\n\n1105\n01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:23.590\nWe're gonna step it up a notch, and\nadd a little complexity to this one.\n\n1106\n01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:28.385\n>> Yeah, we can't just leave\nit on that Caesar cipher note,\n\n1107\n01:02:28.385 --> 01:02:31.760\nno, no you're not getting\nout of here that easily.\n\n1108\n01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.181\nOkay, we gotta bump up\nthe challenge a bit.\n\n1109\n01:02:33.181 --> 01:02:33.810\n>> That's right.\n\n1110\n01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:38.706\n>> So what we're gonna do is we got a\nmessage from the Enigma Machine over here.\n\n1111\n01:02:38.706 --> 01:02:41.275\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n1112\n01:02:41.275 --> 01:02:45.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what we've got is we're gonna\n\n1113\n01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.228\ntalk about what they\ncall the Vigenere cipher.\n\n1114\n01:02:49.228 --> 01:02:50.807\nOr that's [LAUGH] what\nwe're gonna call it.\n\n1115\n01:02:50.807 --> 01:02:54.230\n>> That's what you're gonna call it, yeah?\n\n1116\n01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:56.260\n>> Because apparently both\nour French is horrible.\n\n1117\n01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:59.240\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> So,\nthat's what we're calling it.\n\n1118\n01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.000\nSo, if you're French out there,\ndon't get upset.\n\n1119\n01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.198\n>> Or correct us, one or the other\n>> Yeah, correct us, whatever.\n\n1120\n01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:12.210\n>> So, the Vigenere is really\na slight twist on the Caesar, right?\n\n1121\n01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:17.420\n>> Yeah, what they had to do,\nis at one point, as we discussed\n\n1122\n01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:24.100\nin the prior segment, Caesar cipher is,\nit works, it was effective for the time.\n\n1123\n01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:29.050\nBut at some point,\npeople kinda catch on to what your doing.\n\n1124\n01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:30.930\nThey understand the mechanics of it.\n\n1125\n01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:31.510\nAnd therefore,\n\n1126\n01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:34.430\nif you really wanna keep something secret,\nyou gotta change your game plan, and\n\n1127\n01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:39.560\ngotta do something to counter the fact\nthat they can break your messages.\n\n1128\n01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.690\n>> And we talked about the weaknesses\nof a crypto system and\n\n1129\n01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:45.520\nusing the same key over and\nover and over again.\n\n1130\n01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.811\nNever changing the key is a big weakness,\nand that's what the Caesar did.\n\n1131\n01:03:48.811 --> 01:03:51.387\nIt was always rotate three to the left.\n\n1132\n01:03:51.387 --> 01:03:54.362\nSo you got to the point where,\nyou said that Julius himself could, and\n\n1133\n01:03:54.362 --> 01:03:57.420\nI'm sure there were many people of\nthe time, that could just read it.\n\n1134\n01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.452\nActually looking at the cipher\ntext could do it in their head.\n\n1135\n01:04:00.452 --> 01:04:03.840\nCuz they are using the same key over,\nand over, and over, and over again.\n\n1136\n01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.960\nIt pretty much just becomes another\nlanguage to you at that point.\n\n1137\n01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.094\n>> Yeah, that's really what it is,\nand I think we all kind of do that.\n\n1138\n01:04:12.094 --> 01:04:16.400\nWe hear different codes and\nstuff like that.\n\n1139\n01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.134\nAt some point,\nyou don't even have to look that up.\n\n1140\n01:04:21.134 --> 01:04:23.566\nI've got that when I go flying or\nsomething,\n\n1141\n01:04:23.566 --> 01:04:27.470\nthat I can hear certain codes and\nthose certain things, and that's it,\n\n1142\n01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:31.010\nI know exactly what that is,\nit becomes second nature.\n\n1143\n01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:36.808\nAnd even if you weren't using Caesar's\nvariation on the key shifting technology.\n\n1144\n01:04:36.808 --> 01:04:40.252\nSo you weren't using his,\nbut you were still using\n\n1145\n01:04:40.252 --> 01:04:44.510\nthe key shifting technology it's\nstill doing the same thing.\n\n1146\n01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:48.740\nSo someone could still\nbrute force that thing.\n\n1147\n01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:52.680\n>> If we shifted it seven characters\ninstead of three, okay, great.\n\n1148\n01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.140\nIt's not as easy to spot right away.\n\n1149\n01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.680\nBut eventually,\nwith enough thought into it,\n\n1150\n01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.550\nenough analysis, cryptanalysis,\nI could start to see repeating patterns.\n\n1151\n01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:06.266\nBecause if you're only shifting it seven\ncharacters every time then that D is\n\n1152\n01:05:06.266 --> 01:05:08.960\nalways what is it, E, F, G, H, I, J, K.\n\n1153\n01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:13.133\nAnd a D is always gonna become a K,\nand things like that, and so\n\n1154\n01:05:13.133 --> 01:05:17.680\nyou're starting to see patterns\nwithin the ciphertext.\n\n1155\n01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:22.070\nAnd I can figure out, oh they're shifting\nseven places, cuz an I is the most common\n\n1156\n01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:25.680\ncharacter, or something like that, so\nwe can use little tricks to break it.\n\n1157\n01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.810\nSo Vigenere came up with this\ngreat system and said, all right,\n\n1158\n01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:33.830\nlet's change it up and actually use\na different key for each letter.\n\n1159\n01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:38.230\n>> Yeah, that's what they did, because it\njust works much, much more effectively\n\n1160\n01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:43.920\nthan just using a simple Caesar cipher,\nor a key shifting cypher.\n\n1161\n01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.230\nNo matter which key you use,\nif you're just using that single alphabet,\n\n1162\n01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:50.050\nanybody could brute force it.\n\n1163\n01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:51.820\nIt just doesn't matter.\n\n1164\n01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:55.645\nIn fact, you know what they call\nthat when the Caesar cypher,\n\n1165\n01:05:55.645 --> 01:05:57.867\nwhat everyone uses brute forcing?\n\n1166\n01:05:57.867 --> 01:05:59.259\n>> Uh-uh.\n>> They call it Et tu, Brute.\n\n1167\n01:05:59.259 --> 01:06:00.641\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, all right.\n\n1168\n01:06:00.641 --> 01:06:03.161\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n1169\n01:06:03.161 --> 01:06:04.543\nA little humor for you guys today.\n\n1170\n01:06:04.543 --> 01:06:05.284\n>> That's right.\nI worked it in.\n\n1171\n01:06:05.284 --> 01:06:06.341\nYeah, I worked it in.\n\n1172\n01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:06.980\nI did, worked it in.\n\n1173\n01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:08.838\nDidn't think I'd do it, but I got it.\n\n1174\n01:06:08.838 --> 01:06:10.323\nThat was called opening,\nwalked right through.\n\n1175\n01:06:10.323 --> 01:06:11.183\n>> There we go.\n\n1176\n01:06:11.183 --> 01:06:14.498\n>> But yeah, the Vigenere cypher,\nlike I said,\n\n1177\n01:06:14.498 --> 01:06:17.780\nit adds a level of complexity to that.\n\n1178\n01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:22.360\nWhat happens is,\nwe're using multiple pseudo or\n\n1179\n01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.100\ncrypto alphabets based off of a keyword.\n\n1180\n01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:31.480\nSo now, by changing the difficulty of it,\n\n1181\n01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:35.490\nand not just using that one\nalphabet based off one thing.\n\n1182\n01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:40.277\nYou are choosing a keyword that dictates\n\n1183\n01:06:40.277 --> 01:06:44.795\nevery crypto alphabet, every line.\n\n1184\n01:06:44.795 --> 01:06:45.308\n>> Yeah, so\n\n1185\n01:06:45.308 --> 01:06:49.752\nbasically a different shift on each letter\nof the text you're trying to encrypt.\n\n1186\n01:06:49.752 --> 01:06:53.339\n>> Yeah, and\nthen you're even rotating the key itself.\n\n1187\n01:06:53.339 --> 01:06:57.198\nSo if you're gonna use\nthe Caesar cipher as an example,\n\n1188\n01:06:57.198 --> 01:07:01.059\nit would be like saying for\nthis letter it's three, for\n\n1189\n01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:06.100\nthe next letter it's ten,\nthe next letter after that it's seven.\n\n1190\n01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:10.867\nYou're just changing a different shift for\neach letter, and\n\n1191\n01:07:10.867 --> 01:07:14.910\nit would keep repeating all\nthe way on down the line.\n\n1192\n01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:22.003\nThe whole message was encrypted,\nso it worked tremendously well.\n\n1193\n01:07:22.003 --> 01:07:27.010\nIt was introduced in the beginning of\n\n1194\n01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:32.178\nthe 1400s it was introduced, and\n\n1195\n01:07:32.178 --> 01:07:39.134\nit was effective for about 450, 460 years.\n\n1196\n01:07:39.134 --> 01:07:42.524\nAbout the time the Civil War in the U.S.\n\n1197\n01:07:42.524 --> 01:07:46.820\ncame around,\nyou could break it with some effort.\n\n1198\n01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:50.020\nThey even had special tools\nto do it in the form of\n\n1199\n01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:52.630\nthose brass disks that\nI was talking about.\n\n1200\n01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:58.390\nYou can actually still see some of those\ndisks in museums and stuff like that.\n\n1201\n01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:00.160\nIt's kind of just a fascinating thing.\n\n1202\n01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:05.010\nIn fact as a little side note to that,\nif you keep up on the news or\n\n1203\n01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:07.810\nyou're a Civil War buff or\nanything like that.\n\n1204\n01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:12.990\nThey actually found not too long ago, I\nthink it was about, maybe three years ago.\n\n1205\n01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:18.290\nThey found a little bottle, that was\nstill corked with a message in it,\n\n1206\n01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:19.470\nthat was hidden.\n\n1207\n01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:25.740\nIt had been dropped in some mud, and\nit just had stayed in that mud for\n\n1208\n01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:30.480\nall this time, and someone found it just\na short time ago, with this message in it,\n\n1209\n01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.850\nand the message was encoded.\n\n1210\n01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:39.380\nAnd so they pulled the message out\ncarefully and did some forensics\n\n1211\n01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:44.570\non it to reveal everything that was there\nand then they used the cryptographic\n\n1212\n01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:48.930\ntechniques that were being used\nduring the Civil War to break it.\n\n1213\n01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:54.566\nAnd they uncovered a message of\na Confederate general asking for\n\n1214\n01:08:54.566 --> 01:08:56.341\nreinforcements for\n\n1215\n01:08:56.341 --> 01:09:02.407\nhis position because he knew it was\ngonna fall to the Union soldiers.\n\n1216\n01:09:02.407 --> 01:09:07.997\nSo it was an interesting little nugget\nof something there that cryptography\n\n1217\n01:09:07.997 --> 01:09:13.169\njust had a little role to play, and\nthat's why the South lost the war.\n\n1218\n01:09:13.169 --> 01:09:16.344\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n1219\n01:09:16.344 --> 01:09:21.311\nanyway that's the thing\non the Vigenere cipher,\n\n1220\n01:09:21.311 --> 01:09:26.396\njust developed it to be\nsomething that was stronger\n\n1221\n01:09:26.396 --> 01:09:32.630\nthan what they had before, and\nit worked incredibly well.\n\n1222\n01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:35.750\nIt's tedious, as a lot of you may have,\n\n1223\n01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:40.870\nif you participated in the puzzle leading\nup to this, it is tedious to go through.\n\n1224\n01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:42.490\nNo one's claiming that it isn't.\n\n1225\n01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:46.630\nImagine, we only gave you\na short little thing.\n\n1226\n01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:51.183\nImagine having someone writing out some\nlong letter and saying encrypt it.\n\n1227\n01:09:51.183 --> 01:09:53.401\nYou know, why don't you encrypt it,\nyou wrote it.\n\n1228\n01:09:53.401 --> 01:09:57.205\n>> [LAUGH] And those on the webpage\nthat are going to plug this into either.\n\n1229\n01:09:57.205 --> 01:10:00.090\n>> Yeah that wasn't going to happen, so\n\n1230\n01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:03.884\nyou better become very\nfluent in this technique.\n\n1231\n01:10:03.884 --> 01:10:06.325\nSo, it worked, it worked.\n\n1232\n01:10:06.325 --> 01:10:08.775\n>> Let's give them a problem and\nthen we'll continue on.\n\n1233\n01:10:08.775 --> 01:10:11.560\nI know you want to talk about\nKerckhoff and a couple other things.\n\n1234\n01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.580\nGive them a chance to try\nto plug through this, and\n\n1235\n01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.220\nthen we'll show them what we've got.\n\n1236\n01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:19.267\nSo if we can pull up my screen for\none second, here, what I've got,\n\n1237\n01:10:19.267 --> 01:10:21.752\nI've got an example of a Vigenere table,\n\n1238\n01:10:21.752 --> 01:10:25.730\nwhere across the top I've got my alphabet,\nA through Z.\n\n1239\n01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:28.980\nAnd then each one of these rows,\nit starts,\n\n1240\n01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:31.930\nyou could see I've just done a shift,\none to the left.\n\n1241\n01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:34.770\nSo this first row,\nthe letters match up exactly.\n\n1242\n01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:38.490\nThe second row starts with a B and\nthen the last character is actually an A,\n\n1243\n01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:41.130\nso you can imagine doing\na word wrap there.\n\n1244\n01:10:41.130 --> 01:10:44.490\nAnd then the same thing down the way,\nso this one starts with a C and\n\n1245\n01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:46.800\nthen your A and B are wrapped over there.\n\n1246\n01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:51.460\nAnd the way this is gonna work, is you're\ngonna have a keyword, and technically\n\n1247\n01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:55.790\nthe keyword is supposed to be longer\nthan the text you're trying to encrypt.\n\n1248\n01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:57.560\nAlthough not always the case,\n\n1249\n01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.380\nbut you end up with some\nrepetition if you don't do that.\n\n1250\n01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:05.570\nAnd so what you do is, if that first\nletter of my keyword is a C, all right?\n\n1251\n01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:07.450\nSo my keyword is cryptography.\n\n1252\n01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:10.280\nI'm trying to encrypt the word ITProTV.\n\n1253\n01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.220\nSo what I would do is I'd\ncome up to this table and\n\n1254\n01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.600\nI'd find the row that starts with a C.\n\n1255\n01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.370\nThat's gonna be this one here.\n\n1256\n01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:20.650\nAnd then the first letter I'm\ntrying to encrypt was the I.\n\n1257\n01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:25.140\nSo I go to the row that starts with a C,\nI find the I, and there we go, where\n\n1258\n01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:30.790\nthose two intersect that means the first\nletter on my ciphertext should be a K.\n\n1259\n01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:37.320\nAnd then for the next letter I don't use\nthat same row, we actually change rows, so\n\n1260\n01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:43.670\nan R is the next letter in my key, so I'm\ngonna find a row that starts with an R.\n\n1261\n01:11:43.670 --> 01:11:48.583\nThe second letter of the word\nI'm trying to encrypt is a T,\n\n1262\n01:11:48.583 --> 01:11:53.314\nso I find where that intersects,\nwhich is right there.\n\n1263\n01:11:53.314 --> 01:11:55.251\nWhich would become a K.\n\n1264\n01:11:55.251 --> 01:11:59.610\nAll right, so\nthat's the concept of the vinay table.\n\n1265\n01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:00.370\n>> Exactly.\n\n1266\n01:12:00.370 --> 01:12:02.540\n>> And so you can see,\nvery tedious, right?\n\n1267\n01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:06.320\nI have to keep track of wait, which letter\nin the keyword am I on, which letter of\n\n1268\n01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.400\nthe plain text am I on, so it is a little\ntedious to do, there are some websites,\n\n1269\n01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.330\nand we'll give you guys a chance to\nplug away at that for a little bit.\n\n1270\n01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:17.340\nSee what you come up with, then I'm\ngonna actually plug it into a website\n\n1271\n01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.319\nso that-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1272\n01:12:18.319 --> 01:12:20.721\n>> then do it on TV, and we'll verify or\n\n1273\n01:12:20.721 --> 01:12:22.760\ncheck your answers there.\n\n1274\n01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:23.580\n>> Yeah, see we know.\n\n1275\n01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:24.520\nWe don't have to do this.\n\n1276\n01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.036\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n1277\n01:12:25.036 --> 01:12:26.355\n>> Yeah, you don't so.\n\n1278\n01:12:26.355 --> 01:12:29.044\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I ran through it a couple times\n\n1279\n01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:29.924\n[INAUDIBLE] so.\n\n1280\n01:12:29.924 --> 01:12:30.880\nAll right.\nVery good.\n\n1281\n01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:34.400\nSo we'll take a look at that towards\nthe end of this particular segment.\n\n1282\n01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.590\nAll right, so the next thing we\nwant to talk about that, Sean,\n\n1283\n01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:40.690\nwe've talked about it the other day,\nwe mentioned his name a couple of times.\n\n1284\n01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:44.155\nKerckhoffs, and Kerckhoffs's principle,\nI think, is the way we called it.\n\n1285\n01:12:44.155 --> 01:12:48.260\n>> Yes Kerckhoffs's principle,\nwhen it's mentioned in a previous episode,\n\n1286\n01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:52.010\nit had significance as it\npertained to the algorithm,\n\n1287\n01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:56.360\nand the key, and\nhow you would treat the algorithm.\n\n1288\n01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.850\nVersus how you would treat the key.\n\n1289\n01:12:57.850 --> 01:13:00.850\nThere was, there was some very\nimportant details happening there,\n\n1290\n01:13:00.850 --> 01:13:05.210\nthat we want to make sure that we,\nor that we would like to follow.\n\n1291\n01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:09.195\nThe individual that come up with this,\nI think was Auguste Kerckhoffs.\n\n1292\n01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:13.210\nI think his first name is Auguste.\n\n1293\n01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:14.490\nI know, I can see it.\n\n1294\n01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:15.783\nI don't know if I'm pronouncing it right.\n\n1295\n01:13:15.783 --> 01:13:17.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz it had the E on the end,\n\n1296\n01:13:17.530 --> 01:13:18.350\nthrew me off.\n\n1297\n01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:21.459\n>> I got you.\n>> So, [LAUGH] but the E's silent.\n\n1298\n01:13:21.459 --> 01:13:23.805\nYou know.\n\n1299\n01:13:23.805 --> 01:13:28.500\nBut in any case,\nwhen he came up with this, and\n\n1300\n01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:34.350\nI believe this came up in the 1800's as\nwell, when this principle was brought out,\n\n1301\n01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:38.360\nit was a way to strengthen\ncryptosystems and\n\n1302\n01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:44.190\nat least put some guidelines to allow\ncryptographers to create better\n\n1303\n01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:50.010\ncryptosystems than they had in the past,\ninstead of just kind of doing whatever.\n\n1304\n01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:53.320\nThey had some things that\nthey could think about, and\n\n1305\n01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:59.270\nincorporate into their process to\nmake things just that much better.\n\n1306\n01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:04.190\nSo yesterday I just said it\nwas that the algorithm should\n\n1307\n01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:09.010\nbe left open for public scrutiny, so\nother people could bang on it and\n\n1308\n01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:13.000\nget different sets of eyeballs and\nas many sets of eyeballs on it as you can,\n\n1309\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.490\nto make sure there's no funny\nstuff going on or any whatever.\n\n1310\n01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:21.610\nAnd then of course you\nkept the key secret.\n\n1311\n01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:23.216\nYou always keep key secret.\n\n1312\n01:14:23.216 --> 01:14:28.805\nJust knowing the algorithm doesn't\nreveal how to decrypt a particular item,\n\n1313\n01:14:28.805 --> 01:14:33.472\nbecause there's other stuff\ninvolved in that, namely the key.\n\n1314\n01:14:33.472 --> 01:14:36.907\nBut Kerckhoffs's principle\nisn't just that,\n\n1315\n01:14:36.907 --> 01:14:40.851\nthere's other things that\nget factored into that too.\n\n1316\n01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:46.324\nKerckhoffs's, I've broken it down\nhere into six principles for\n\n1317\n01:14:46.324 --> 01:14:48.970\nyou that Kerckhoffs put forth.\n\n1318\n01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:54.246\nOne of them being,\nthe system when you make a cryptosystem,\n\n1319\n01:14:54.246 --> 01:14:58.386\nyou try to make it\ntheoretically unbreakable,\n\n1320\n01:14:58.386 --> 01:15:02.629\nthat's your goal is to make\nit such a way that it is\n\n1321\n01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:08.140\nunbreakable when it's checked out and\nput into practice.\n\n1322\n01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:12.369\nHowever with that being the case,\nif you can't accomplish that,\n\n1323\n01:15:12.369 --> 01:15:16.157\nif you know there's theoretical\nways to break something.\n\n1324\n01:15:16.157 --> 01:15:20.087\nWe just got to make sure they're\nnot breakable in practice,\n\n1325\n01:15:20.087 --> 01:15:23.177\nin reasonable practice, that's important.\n\n1326\n01:15:23.177 --> 01:15:27.834\nIn reasonable practice you should be able\nto use the thing without any concern\n\n1327\n01:15:27.834 --> 01:15:32.345\nthat's someone's gonna be able to\nbreak that thing, today, tomorrow,\n\n1328\n01:15:32.345 --> 01:15:34.050\nnext day, whatever.\n\n1329\n01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:39.034\nIt should take a considerable amount of\ntime, and to say, hey, I could break your\n\n1330\n01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:44.610\nmessage but I'll have the answer for you\nin a hundred years, that's not reasonable.\n\n1331\n01:15:44.610 --> 01:15:47.410\nTherefore, it wouldn't fall under\nthis particular file control-\n\n1332\n01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:49.440\n>> Theoretically, I could break it.\n\n1333\n01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:52.980\nBut practically, I don't have enough\ntime in a lifetime to break it, so\n\n1334\n01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:55.232\nwe would consider it unbreakable.\n\n1335\n01:15:55.232 --> 01:15:59.680\n>> Yeah, and it's just like I mentioned\nMD5 earlier as being that there were some\n\n1336\n01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:04.470\nproblems with it, and one of our reviewers\nout here said, well those were theoretical\n\n1337\n01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:08.910\nand yeah, they're theoretical.\n\n1338\n01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:12.410\nThey've done some stuff just in case,\nto make sure.\n\n1339\n01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:17.790\nBut the thing is that they\nare theoretical, they are there, so\n\n1340\n01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:24.740\nthere's a chance that in practice,\nthey could be taken advantage of.\n\n1341\n01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:29.900\nThat's the first thing to remember, they\nshould be theoretically unbreakable, or\n\n1342\n01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:33.180\njust not practical to break in\na reasonable amount of time.\n\n1343\n01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:35.450\nSo that would be that first one.\n\n1344\n01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:39.700\nSo, we have that down.\n\n1345\n01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:46.280\nThe second principle I've got noted here,\nis the secrecy of the algorithm itself.\n\n1346\n01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.860\nIt really pertains to that.\n\n1347\n01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:52.560\nWhat this principle says, or\nthis component of the principle says that,\n\n1348\n01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:58.690\nif I were to for whatever reason,\njust put my algorithm out here\n\n1349\n01:16:58.690 --> 01:17:04.240\nthat I designed and it's a super\nduper ultimate whatever algorithm,\n\n1350\n01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.340\njust the fact that you can lay\neyeballs on it and understand it and\n\n1351\n01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:13.200\nscrutinize it in no way,\nshape, or form means that\n\n1352\n01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:17.410\nyou can necessarily break it.\n\n1353\n01:17:17.410 --> 01:17:18.900\nSo that's important.\n\n1354\n01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:23.720\nJust giving you access to the algorithm,\ndoes not in any way,\n\n1355\n01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.590\nshape or form compromise security.\n\n1356\n01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:31.230\nIf it does,\nif someone can look at the algorithm.\n\n1357\n01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:34.640\nAnd very easily compromise\nsecurity just off of knowing that.\n\n1358\n01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.520\nYou've got a very poor algorithm that\nneeds to be rearchitected or discarded and\n\n1359\n01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.230\nyou start from scratch.\n\n1360\n01:17:40.230 --> 01:17:43.860\nAnd there have been cases\nwhere that's happened, but\n\n1361\n01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:48.590\nwe try to avoid those, or\nwe do need to avoid that just outright.\n\n1362\n01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:51.110\nThey should not be able to\nglean that information from it.\n\n1363\n01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:53.020\nThey should see what it's doing inside,\n\n1364\n01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:56.910\nand they should be able to understand\nwhat the key space looks like.\n\n1365\n01:17:56.910 --> 01:18:00.150\nAnd then, from there, they don't\n\n1366\n01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:05.180\nhave enough to really break it in\na reasonable or practical amount of time.\n\n1367\n01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:10.160\nWhich is why you can look up a lot of\nthe algorithms that are just open for\n\n1368\n01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.570\nscrutiny, you can go look at them and\nthey don't mind.\n\n1369\n01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:16.110\nThey just don't.\n\n1370\n01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:21.080\nThey're put out there by many, many\nresearch institutions and stuff like that.\n\n1371\n01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.630\nAnd you can use them wherever you want.\n\n1372\n01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:24.330\nAnd that's something about cryptography,\ntoo.\n\n1373\n01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:26.090\nThere are a lot of algorithms.\n\n1374\n01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:29.020\nThat are just completely free to use,\nand you go ahead and\n\n1375\n01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.970\nuse it however you see fit.\n\n1376\n01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:34.400\nBut then there also are proprietary\nones that they lock down and they say,\n\n1377\n01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:39.150\nyou know what I don't care who\nKerckhoffs is, I don't care,\n\n1378\n01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:41.824\nI have never heard of him, and I'm sure\nas hell not gonna play by this rules.\n\n1379\n01:18:41.824 --> 01:18:43.470\n>> [LAUGH] A lot of those people I think,\n\n1380\n01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:46.900\nthat's when the monetary\nvalue comes into play, right?\n\n1381\n01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:50.670\nThey develop this algorithm and it's not\nthat they're afraid if it gets out there\n\n1382\n01:18:50.670 --> 01:18:54.760\nthat people can figure it out,\nbecause it's gotta be a good algorithm,\n\n1383\n01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.320\nbut they also don't want other\npeople to use their algorithm.\n\n1384\n01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:00.540\nThey say no, the heck with that, you spend\nthe time to develop your own algorithm.\n\n1385\n01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.173\nThis is the one that we're gonna use.\n\n1386\n01:19:02.173 --> 01:19:02.926\nAll right?\n\n1387\n01:19:02.926 --> 01:19:04.010\n>> Yeah.\n\n1388\n01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:06.740\nThere's not a ton like that,\n\n1389\n01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:11.610\nthat they will actually make you pay for,\nbut they are out there.\n\n1390\n01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:15.060\nI believe, what is it,\nCast is one of them.\n\n1391\n01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:18.570\nI think Cast is one of them,\ncuz you don't see Cast all that much.\n\n1392\n01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:24.380\nYou see it in a few products, but it\nisn't out there all that much or at least\n\n1393\n01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:28.830\nit wasn't for a long time, because they\nwant to charge you a licensing fee for it.\n\n1394\n01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:30.980\nSo most people say well\nI've got other options.\n\n1395\n01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:35.350\nI don't need yours and they just got\nkind of pushed off to the wayside, or\n\n1396\n01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:38.850\nmarginalized, to a certain degree.\n\n1397\n01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:41.101\n>> And one quick note before we\nmove on to that third point there,\n\n1398\n01:19:41.101 --> 01:19:43.524\nmake sure everybody's got that so\nthey've got time to work on it,\n\n1399\n01:19:43.524 --> 01:19:44.935\ncuz I don't know if I made that clear.\n\n1400\n01:19:44.935 --> 01:19:49.638\nFor the vinay table, in that problem\nwe were doing The plain text that I\n\n1401\n01:19:49.638 --> 01:19:52.758\nwant you to encrypt is ITProTV,\nall one word.\n\n1402\n01:19:52.758 --> 01:19:57.657\nI-T-P-R-O-T-V and I want you to use\nthe key word, or the key is cryptography,\n\n1403\n01:19:57.657 --> 01:20:01.590\nso that's gonna be the one that\ndetermines what row you're using.\n\n1404\n01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:06.200\nSo there the key is cryptography,\nand the plain text is ITProTV.\n\n1405\n01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.320\nAnd we wanna know what\nthe ciphertext is gonna be.\n\n1406\n01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:12.630\nAll right, so back to our Kirchhoff then,\nprinciple three.\n\n1407\n01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:14.000\n>> I think you had a finger slip there.\n\n1408\n01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:14.690\n>> Oh, what's that?\n\n1409\n01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:16.700\n>> The cryptography,\nI think you had a finger slip there.\n\n1410\n01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.290\n>> Oh yeah,\nit would help if I could spell.\n\n1411\n01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:19.155\n>> Oops!\n[LAUGH]\n\n1412\n01:20:19.155 --> 01:20:20.970\n>> So if you're watching this live,\n\n1413\n01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:24.351\nspell cryptography properly when\nyou're using it as your key,\n\n1414\n01:20:24.351 --> 01:20:27.525\notherwise you're not gonna\ncome up with the right answer.\n\n1415\n01:20:27.525 --> 01:20:29.350\n[LAUGH]\n>> Hey, I'm not a typist either,\n\n1416\n01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:32.050\nI would've done the same type of thing.\n\n1417\n01:20:32.050 --> 01:20:33.980\nIn fact,\nthat would've been better than me.\n\n1418\n01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:34.690\nI'm horrible.\n\n1419\n01:20:34.690 --> 01:20:36.440\nI write books and I can't type.\n\n1420\n01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:36.970\nI really can't.\n\n1421\n01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:42.440\n>> So third principal,\nkey should be memorable.\n\n1422\n01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:48.530\n>> Yeah, it should be memorable without\nnotes and it should be easy to change it.\n\n1423\n01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:49.840\nThe easy to change part makes sense.\n\n1424\n01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:53.040\nYou have a key space, you should\nbe able to by falling the rules,\n\n1425\n01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:59.790\nbe able to generate easily a new key\nthat follows those rules, bang, done.\n\n1426\n01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:01.900\nAnd it should be something,\nonce you generate a key, and\n\n1427\n01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:06.440\nthis is the one where it's actually kinda,\nyou've got to put it in the right context.\n\n1428\n01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:10.462\nThey say, Kirchhoff says keys should\nbe memorable without notes and\n\n1429\n01:21:10.462 --> 01:21:12.110\nbe easily changeable.\n\n1430\n01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:13.598\nYou look at without notes.\n\n1431\n01:21:13.598 --> 01:21:14.997\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n1432\n01:21:14.997 --> 01:21:16.130\n>> Well he wasn't dealing with.\n\n1433\n01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:16.774\n>> Obviously this long, yeah, okay.\n>> Yeah,\n\n1434\n01:21:16.774 --> 01:21:19.410\nhe wasn't dealing with 4096 bits, right?\n\n1435\n01:21:19.410 --> 01:21:20.590\n>> Yeah, it's.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1436\n01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:23.153\n>> I would say, okay well and you have,\n\n1437\n01:21:23.153 --> 01:21:28.198\nwhen you have a key, it should,\nit's not so much the making notes part,\n\n1438\n01:21:28.198 --> 01:21:31.395\nit's having a secure\nmechanism to store it.\n\n1439\n01:21:31.395 --> 01:21:32.340\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1440\n01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:35.736\n>> That's more what we'd be looking for\nbecause [CROSSTALK]\n\n1441\n01:21:35.736 --> 01:21:37.830\n>> We had to modernize it a little bit.\n\n1442\n01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:43.260\n>> Yeah, it just shouldn't\nbe something that there's no\n\n1443\n01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:48.620\nway to remember it without\nhaving some sort of note.\n\n1444\n01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:49.770\nThat's what he's getting at.\n\n1445\n01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:50.660\nBut anyway.\n\n1446\n01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:52.830\n>> And the next one probably\nfalls into the same lines, right?\n\n1447\n01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:55.319\nIt probably needs to be updated\na little bit for our times.\n\n1448\n01:21:55.319 --> 01:21:57.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1449\n01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:59.740\n>> Yeah, this is another rule that,\n\n1450\n01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:03.290\nyes, it's gotta be updated to current-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1451\n01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:05.525\n>> To current environments.\n\n1452\n01:22:05.525 --> 01:22:12.210\nBut Kirchhoff said that should\nbe transmittable by a telegraph.\n\n1453\n01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:15.040\nSo those are just all the telegraph.\n\n1454\n01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.718\n>> I've got one at my house.\n\n1455\n01:22:16.718 --> 01:22:19.434\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1456\n01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:20.280\n>> But the point is,\n\n1457\n01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.430\ntelegraph being one of the means\nof communication back then and\n\n1458\n01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:28.630\nit had to be something simple enough\nto be able to transmit via that system.\n\n1459\n01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:31.190\n>> And it would be the same thing now.\n\n1460\n01:22:31.190 --> 01:22:33.921\n>> We're just sending\nelectrical bits which, heck,\n\n1461\n01:22:33.921 --> 01:22:36.040\nthe telegraph was doing the same thing.\n\n1462\n01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:39.968\nSo I mean, really, it is the same concept,\nwe just have a different device doing it.\n\n1463\n01:22:39.968 --> 01:22:46.111\n>> Yeah, exact same concept, absolutely,\nit just has to be something that is easily\n\n1464\n01:22:46.111 --> 01:22:51.750\ntransmittable over whatever mechanism\nyou're using now or in the future.\n\n1465\n01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:57.070\nSo you've gotta consider if that's\nsomething that is practical for\n\n1466\n01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:59.930\nthat environment, is optimized for\nthat environment.\n\n1467\n01:22:59.930 --> 01:23:02.160\nI'd even throw in when you look at this,\nand say,\n\n1468\n01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:04.510\nshould it be transmittable by telegraph?\n\n1469\n01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:08.330\nI'd even say if you were gonna update it\nfor modern technology, it should also be,\n\n1470\n01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:11.500\nis it something that, things on\nthe other end that you're giving it to,\n\n1471\n01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:15.025\nthat there's enough oomph or horsepower\nthere for them to work with it as well.\n\n1472\n01:23:15.025 --> 01:23:17.060\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Cuz there's more than just transmitting\n\n1473\n01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:22.110\nit, it's also, they have to convert it\nback to something that they can read.\n\n1474\n01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:24.610\nAnd so\nyou don't wanna send it some place and,\n\n1475\n01:23:24.610 --> 01:23:28.740\nyou've got the nice supercomputer\nwith all the trimmings, and bells and\n\n1476\n01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:32.560\nwhistles on it, and\nthey got a slide rule, okay?\n\n1477\n01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.485\n>> Yeah.\n>> Shoulda looked it up.\n\n1478\n01:23:33.485 --> 01:23:35.720\nTold you.\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n1479\n01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:36.600\nThen what do we got next?\n\n1480\n01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.480\nWhat's another one of these principles?\n\n1481\n01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:42.390\n>> This is something else\nthat's really important,\n\n1482\n01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:47.420\nthat Kirchhoff put in his principle\nas well, as one of his notes.\n\n1483\n01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:52.870\nHe said, apparatus or document should be\nportable and operable by a single person.\n\n1484\n01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:59.880\nOkay, that's another big, big important\nthing, you need to have a cryptosystem.\n\n1485\n01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:03.593\nThat once it's set up and\nconfigured and ready to go,\n\n1486\n01:24:03.593 --> 01:24:08.476\nit should only require one person to\nget stuff in and out of the system.\n\n1487\n01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:13.249\nThere shouldn't have to be that have to\ninvolve multiple other parties to make\n\n1488\n01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:14.840\nthis happen.\n\n1489\n01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:18.850\nAnd you could make some\ncases where there's\n\n1490\n01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:23.580\nsituations where there are multiple\nparties involved, okay?\n\n1491\n01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:26.750\nWe have to make sure that if there's\nmultiple parties involved in\n\n1492\n01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:31.370\na cryptosystem, we need to distinguish\nare those people maintaining the system or\n\n1493\n01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:34.270\nis this someone actually using the system?\n\n1494\n01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:37.630\nAnd so that's very, very, very important.\n\n1495\n01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:44.210\nIt's even kind of funny with the way\nhe words this apparatus or documents.\n\n1496\n01:24:44.210 --> 01:24:46.840\nShould be portable operable\nby a single person.\n\n1497\n01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:49.300\nThat portable part, wow.\n\n1498\n01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:54.010\nThat portable has meant different\nthings at different points in time.\n\n1499\n01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:57.883\n>> I'm thinking back to the ones we saw\nyesterday with the like the World War II,\n\n1500\n01:24:57.883 --> 01:25:00.097\nwas it World War I or\nWorld War II apparatus?\n\n1501\n01:25:00.097 --> 01:25:03.631\nThe M2, something, 260 or 290?\n\n1502\n01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:05.270\n>> Oh, the small arm-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1503\n01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:06.207\n>> We use that was World War II.\n\n1504\n01:25:06.207 --> 01:25:09.170\n>> Yeah, so something that was portable\nout there in the field, right?\n\n1505\n01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:14.310\n>> Yeah, by today's standards,\nit might seem a little clunky and such.\n\n1506\n01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:17.640\nBut it still would be considered portable.\n\n1507\n01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:22.580\nAnd so that was another important detail,\nwe have to have something that was\n\n1508\n01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:26.840\nvery easily portable by a person.\n\n1509\n01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:30.220\nYou didn't need to have several\npieces that were assembled and\n\n1510\n01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:31.650\nall this nastiness.\n\n1511\n01:25:31.650 --> 01:25:37.060\nHad to be something that an individual\ncan transport and use as required.\n\n1512\n01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:42.040\nThat M209 that we saw,\nthat was something that we\n\n1513\n01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:47.320\ncould very easily have someone carry\nin their pack or in their side.\n\n1514\n01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:51.160\nAnd pull it out and\njust chatter away on the thing.\n\n1515\n01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:54.250\nThe enigma machine would\nbe the same sort of thing,\n\n1516\n01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:58.420\neven though it's a little bit bigger\nthan that little device we saw.\n\n1517\n01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:00.140\nIt was also designed to be portable.\n\n1518\n01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:04.210\nThose cases that you saw,\nthey could be closed up, locked, and\n\n1519\n01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:07.100\nthere's a handle on them\nthat they're transportable.\n\n1520\n01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:11.840\nMaybe not your idea, or our idea of\nbeing transportable now a days, but\n\n1521\n01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.164\nit was definitely designed\nto be transportable.\n\n1522\n01:26:15.164 --> 01:26:20.928\nAnd that's how when they captured German\nsubmarines with those things in them.\n\n1523\n01:26:20.928 --> 01:26:24.760\nThey were able to get them out of there so\neasily, they just pull the thing out.\n\n1524\n01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:28.225\nIf it was a big device it\nwouldn't have helped too much.\n\n1525\n01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:31.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now a days, of course, we've got, heck,\n\n1526\n01:26:31.290 --> 01:26:35.220\nthe military's got way\nsmaller devices than that\n\n1527\n01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:38.370\nthat are magnitudes more powerful.\n\n1528\n01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:40.331\nThat you wouldn't even know that\nthat's what they were, [CROSSTALK]\n\n1529\n01:26:40.331 --> 01:26:41.639\n>> Got an Apple watch.\n\n1530\n01:26:41.639 --> 01:26:44.160\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] I don't,\nI'm kidding.\n\n1531\n01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.225\nAll right and in the last one there, Sean.\n\n1532\n01:26:46.225 --> 01:26:50.190\n>> Kirchhoff says system should be easy,\n\n1533\n01:26:50.190 --> 01:26:54.960\nneither requiring knowledge of a long list\nof rules nor involving a mental strain.\n\n1534\n01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.120\n>> Well, that's relative.\n\n1535\n01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.616\nI strain on the Caesar cipher.\n\n1536\n01:26:57.616 --> 01:26:58.130\n>> Yeah.\n\n1537\n01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:00.358\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1538\n01:27:00.358 --> 01:27:04.760\nthat could be a little relative term.\n\n1539\n01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:10.610\nThey're saying it should be simple\nenough that a caveman can do it now.\n\n1540\n01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:12.522\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There is probably people here\n\n1541\n01:27:12.522 --> 01:27:13.750\nthat do not even get\nthe reference anymore.\n\n1542\n01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:17.190\nBut it should be something\nthat is simple enough that\n\n1543\n01:27:19.650 --> 01:27:23.860\nalmost you get to the point where a\nlayperson can use it with a little bit of\n\n1544\n01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:27.950\ntraining and that's it.\n\n1545\n01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:32.900\nThey will see something that they\ncan input their information into and\n\n1546\n01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:34.520\nthey will get output for it.\n\n1547\n01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.370\nNo matter what that is.\n\n1548\n01:27:35.370 --> 01:27:36.160\nIf you're talking pen and\n\n1549\n01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.800\npaper, if you're talking those\nportable devices, what have you.\n\n1550\n01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:43.057\nIt's something that\nthey can easily use and\n\n1551\n01:27:43.057 --> 01:27:47.643\nthey don't need to know what's\ngoing on behind the curtain.\n\n1552\n01:27:47.643 --> 01:27:48.514\nI mean think about it.\n\n1553\n01:27:48.514 --> 01:27:52.488\nThink how many of us would never use\ncryptography if you had to figure out what\n\n1554\n01:27:52.488 --> 01:27:54.460\nAES meant before you could use it.\n\n1555\n01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:55.865\n>> Right.\n>> Don't pass go, man.\n\n1556\n01:27:55.865 --> 01:27:57.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That would be it.\n\n1557\n01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.920\n>> Well, and like that vignette\nthey were talking about.\n\n1558\n01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:03.650\nWe gave you guys a few simple\ninstructions, and using that and\n\n1559\n01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:07.930\na little bit of brain power,\nyou're able to accomplish the task.\n\n1560\n01:28:07.930 --> 01:28:08.730\n>> Exactly.\n\n1561\n01:28:08.730 --> 01:28:13.810\nIt's tedious, it's a tedious process, but\n\n1562\n01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:18.675\nit doesn't require you to really think\nabout the system too much if at all.\n\n1563\n01:28:18.675 --> 01:28:22.805\nAll you know is hey just get a keyword and\n\n1564\n01:28:22.805 --> 01:28:29.795\njust follow the roads and\noutput your cipher text, that's it.\n\n1565\n01:28:29.795 --> 01:28:31.870\nThere's really not much more to it.\n\n1566\n01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:34.520\nYes there's mathematics,\nand all that behind it,\n\n1567\n01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.680\nand rules that create\nthese type of things.\n\n1568\n01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:39.330\nAnd then there's other\nstuff that goes in it, but\n\n1569\n01:28:39.330 --> 01:28:42.230\nyou don't need to think about those,\nit's completely unimportant.\n\n1570\n01:28:42.230 --> 01:28:44.000\n>> Right.\n>> So, you can just get it and\n\n1571\n01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.920\nuse the thing,\nwhich is what we wanna have.\n\n1572\n01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:49.850\nIt needs to be something that the average\nJoe can sit down in front of, and\n\n1573\n01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:55.320\njust use it without all this extra thing\ngoing through their head as a barrier.\n\n1574\n01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.030\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n1575\n01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.560\nAll right.\nSo\n\n1576\n01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:02.140\nKirchhoff came up with some good\nprinciples that guide the development of\n\n1577\n01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:07.290\nthese encryption algorithms, and\nwhat makes a good encryption algorithm.\n\n1578\n01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:10.230\nAll right.\nSo and Chris gets the gold star there with\n\n1579\n01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:13.420\nthe Geico commercial reference,\nso easy a caveman can do it.\n\n1580\n01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:16.220\nAnd now let's take a look at this\n\n1581\n01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:20.440\nvignette problem that we gave you\nback at the beginning of the episode.\n\n1582\n01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:25.120\nSo if you were playing along we gave you,\nthe keyword was going to be\n\n1583\n01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:30.150\ncryptography and\nthe plain text was IT Pro TV.\n\n1584\n01:29:30.150 --> 01:29:32.650\nAnd we were gonna try to see\nwhat that cypher text was,\n\n1585\n01:29:32.650 --> 01:29:36.880\nand I don't think I got any answers\nout there in the chat room.\n\n1586\n01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.860\nEverybody gave up halfway through that or\nsomething.\n\n1587\n01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:41.928\n>> Don't make me turn this thing around.\n\n1588\n01:29:41.928 --> 01:29:45.320\n>> [LAUGH] If you're watching\nthe recording, just hope you paused it,\n\n1589\n01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:48.600\nworked on it a little while and\nthen come back and check the answer here.\n\n1590\n01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.900\nAnd I'm gonna cheat a little bit,\n\n1591\n01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:55.350\nI am gonna use the online form to make it\na little bit easier to show everybody.\n\n1592\n01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:59.120\nSo same though that I had drawn up\nearlier in that excel spreadsheet.\n\n1593\n01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.050\nI've got my Vignette table.\n\n1594\n01:30:01.050 --> 01:30:05.370\nYou could see everything is shifted\none character to the left for\n\n1595\n01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:07.280\neach one of these rows.\n\n1596\n01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:11.480\nAnd then what you do is you take if\nthe first letter of your keyword was\n\n1597\n01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.470\na c like for us.\n\n1598\n01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:17.070\nFor cryptography, the first letter of\nthe word I want to encrypt was an i for\n\n1599\n01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:22.910\nIT Pro TV, where those guys intersect,\nthat should become a k.\n\n1600\n01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:25.910\nSo, then to cheat,\nwe'll come down here to the bottom, and\n\n1601\n01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:29.260\nI'll throw this link out there for\nyou guys as well, so you can play along.\n\n1602\n01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:30.629\nI'll do that here in just a second.\n\n1603\n01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:33.570\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna type in my keyword,\n\n1604\n01:30:33.570 --> 01:30:35.895\nwhich was cryptography\nspelled correctly this time.\n\n1605\n01:30:35.895 --> 01:30:39.150\n>> [LAUGH] Happens to the best of us, man.\n\n1606\n01:30:39.150 --> 01:30:41.000\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think this is gonna be spelled right.\n\n1607\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:41.690\nLet's check that.\n\n1608\n01:30:41.690 --> 01:30:43.830\nYeah, look at there, all kinds of.\n\n1609\n01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:48.620\nCan't talk and type at the same time.\n\n1610\n01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:50.690\nAll right,\nthere's my keyword cryptography.\n\n1611\n01:30:50.690 --> 01:30:53.580\nAnd the cool thing about this\nweb page is it will let you\n\n1612\n01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:55.220\nbuild the square right here.\n\n1613\n01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:58.890\nAnd it filters down the entire\ntable to just what you need,\n\n1614\n01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:00.610\naccording to your keyword.\n\n1615\n01:31:00.610 --> 01:31:02.550\nSo you can see what they've done here.\n\n1616\n01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:05.740\nSince my keyword was cryptography,\nthe first letter is a C, so\n\n1617\n01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:08.690\nthe row I want starts with a C, so\n\n1618\n01:31:08.690 --> 01:31:13.200\nyou can basically see my keyboard\nlisted right here In this first column.\n\n1619\n01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:16.140\nSo now all you have to do is the first\nletter was an i, that's gonna be a k,\n\n1620\n01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:20.110\nthe second letter was a t,\nthat's gonna be a k again.\n\n1621\n01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:21.280\nInteresting right there, right.\n\n1622\n01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:25.340\nThe way the same letter comes up\nrepresenting two different letters.\n\n1623\n01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:28.614\nBut then we'll put my plain text in here,\nITProTV.\n\n1624\n01:31:28.614 --> 01:31:37.070\nAnd then we'll choose to encipher,\nand there is my encrypted text.\n\n1625\n01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:39.580\nI don't know if you guys can see that,\nI'll zoom in just a wee bit.\n\n1626\n01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:47.560\nThere's the cipher text that\nresults KKNGHHB, right?\n\n1627\n01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:52.080\nSo again, I didn't see anybody\nplaying along with me, there you go.\n\n1628\n01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.130\nLooks like Ben got it started anyway.\n\n1629\n01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:59.460\nBut, yeah that's the Vingette table and\nthat's the way that cipher works.\n\n1630\n01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:00.520\nPretty straightforward.\n\n1631\n01:32:01.710 --> 01:32:04.295\nOnce you understand what's going\non in the background, right, Sean?\n\n1632\n01:32:04.295 --> 01:32:05.460\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1633\n01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:06.670\n>> That's the key.\n\n1634\n01:32:06.670 --> 01:32:11.110\nOnce you figure that out, just like\nyou said, tedious but very effective.\n\n1635\n01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:13.850\nAnd I love this,\nthis is a great example of how,\n\n1636\n01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:19.100\nthe first two letters are not the same IT,\nyet it comes with a KK.\n\n1637\n01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:23.080\nThe last two, right before the end\nthere are not the same but\n\n1638\n01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.480\nthey come out as the same H and H.\n\n1639\n01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:30.790\nIn fact, the T isn't like where a plain\ntext twice, it became a K this time.\n\n1640\n01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:33.330\nBut the last T actually\nconverted into an H.\n\n1641\n01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:38.970\nSo you can see the sign of a good\nalgorithm there is, I don't have that\n\n1642\n01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:43.740\nrepeatability that might aid somebody\ntrying to do cryptanalysis on this.\n\n1643\n01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:46.840\n>> Yeah you're exactly right,\nthe Cesar cypher,\n\n1644\n01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:52.320\njust with that one row you could do\npattern and statistical analysis on that.\n\n1645\n01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:57.910\nTo give you a better clue, or\nto completely break the system.\n\n1646\n01:32:57.910 --> 01:33:01.280\nHere, by using multiple crypto alphabets,\nand\n\n1647\n01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:05.230\nrotating the keys as you do,\neven though something may.\n\n1648\n01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:12.140\nCryp to the same letter even though the\nplain text was different letters, it won't\n\n1649\n01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:16.930\nallow you to do standard statistical,\nor pattern, or use recognition on it.\n\n1650\n01:33:16.930 --> 01:33:21.840\nThat's how you'll have to tweak\nthose to get that sort of thing.\n\n1651\n01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:22.770\n>> Cuz I might be trying to think well,\n\n1652\n01:33:22.770 --> 01:33:25.720\nwhat's something that starts with\nthe same two letters, right?\n\n1653\n01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.840\nCuz I expect a k and a k to be,\n\n1654\n01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:31.390\nthe plain text must have been the same\nto come out with the same cypher text.\n\n1655\n01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:33.200\nBut it was not, so.\n\n1656\n01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:36.630\n>> Yeah, it was a really clever way, and\n\n1657\n01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:40.286\na really effective way to defeat\nsome of these techniques.\n\n1658\n01:33:40.286 --> 01:33:45.460\nThings that made Vignette actually\nweaker were just people reusing\n\n1659\n01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:50.430\nkeywords and stuff like that,\nwas just its big downfall.\n\n1660\n01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:53.590\nIn fact, during the Civil War there was a,\n\n1661\n01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:58.470\ntowards the end of it the Confederates\nwere reusing keywords.\n\n1662\n01:33:58.470 --> 01:34:04.650\nThey were using stuff like come\nreckoning or something like that.\n\n1663\n01:34:04.650 --> 01:34:06.570\nAnd retribution and stuff like,\n\n1664\n01:34:06.570 --> 01:34:09.840\nthat towards the end of it when they were,\nyou know they knew that they\n\n1665\n01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:13.820\nwere basically out of the picture\nit was just a matter of time.\n\n1666\n01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:15.910\nThose type of things they started using so\n\n1667\n01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:18.330\nit made it even easier that someone\ncould just get the thing out.\n\n1668\n01:34:18.330 --> 01:34:22.210\nIt's like I what they're probably\nusing one of like four keys and\n\n1669\n01:34:22.210 --> 01:34:27.380\njust go ahead and\nuse one of those things and boom done.\n\n1670\n01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:30.680\n>> What amazes me is this was all\ndone before we had computers.\n\n1671\n01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:32.250\nOur computers make it pretty easy.\n\n1672\n01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:33.720\nAnother thing I want to show\nyou one more thing real\n\n1673\n01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:35.740\nquick if we can pull my screen back up.\n\n1674\n01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:38.210\nI made sure that I used a keyword\n\n1675\n01:34:38.210 --> 01:34:41.700\nthat was longer than the text\nthat I wanted to encrypt.\n\n1676\n01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:45.440\nAnd that's actually one of the issues\nthat we can run into sometimes with\n\n1677\n01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:49.050\nencryption algorithms like this,\nis we get a little lazy with our keywords.\n\n1678\n01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:51.820\nBecause if I have a paragraph to encrypt,\n\n1679\n01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:54.090\ndo I have a keyword\nthat's a paragraph long.\n\n1680\n01:34:54.090 --> 01:34:57.770\nYou know, I mean, it becomes very\ndifficult to transmit the keyword.\n\n1681\n01:34:57.770 --> 01:35:01.180\nAnd what happens, just to show you\na little example, if I throw in a really\n\n1682\n01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:06.480\nshort keyword, like this, what's gonna\nhappen is there's not enough rows.\n\n1683\n01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:11.560\nIf I'm trying to encrypt the word ITProTV,\nwell the first letter we're\n\n1684\n01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.070\nusing that D the second letter we're using\nthe A, the third letter we're using the Y.\n\n1685\n01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:19.410\nFor the fourth letter I gotta go back and\nuse the D row again, right?\n\n1686\n01:35:19.410 --> 01:35:20.350\nSo we're back.\n\n1687\n01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:23.570\nSo you see the repetition\nthat's going to occur there?\n\n1688\n01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:27.820\nAnd that could just aide\nsomebody in the cryptanalysis.\n\n1689\n01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:32.920\n>> So you see kind of a flaw, or potential\nflaw in the system is, if you don't,\n\n1690\n01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:37.864\nyou're right, if you, the correct way\nto use this is to choose something\n\n1691\n01:35:37.864 --> 01:35:42.131\nthat's as long or\nlonger than what you're trying to encrypt.\n\n1692\n01:35:42.131 --> 01:35:46.484\nIf you don't, then you can very\neasily get to a territory where you\n\n1693\n01:35:46.484 --> 01:35:50.995\nstart Repeating things and\nthat's going to start to show your hand,\n\n1694\n01:35:50.995 --> 01:35:55.530\nso you try to make sure that you\ndon't do that, but it can be tough.\n\n1695\n01:35:55.530 --> 01:35:56.420\n>> Yeah.\n>> It can be very tough.\n\n1696\n01:35:56.420 --> 01:36:00.150\n>> And it still doesn't make it\nsuper easy for them either so.\n\n1697\n01:36:00.150 --> 01:36:02.140\n>> Yeah, it still doesn't.\n\n1698\n01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:05.352\nYou could use mathematics and\n\n1699\n01:36:05.352 --> 01:36:10.105\nstuff like that to ease the burden a bit,\nbut\n\n1700\n01:36:10.105 --> 01:36:16.030\nit's still gonna be a fairly\nuphill climb from there.\n\n1701\n01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:20.730\nSo you could probably get away\nwith using a shorter key than\n\n1702\n01:36:20.730 --> 01:36:25.330\nthe actual stuff you're encrypting,\nbut it's not advisable.\n\n1703\n01:36:25.330 --> 01:36:26.750\nIf you were gonna use\nsomething like this for\n\n1704\n01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:30.700\nsomething that you really want to\nkeep secret, you wouldn't do that.\n\n1705\n01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:33.052\nYou'd make sure it was as long, or longer.\n\n1706\n01:36:33.052 --> 01:36:34.551\n>> Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\n\n1707\n01:36:34.551 --> 01:36:35.782\n>> Yeah, find something.\n\n1708\n01:36:35.782 --> 01:36:39.792\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, something like that.\n\n1709\n01:36:39.792 --> 01:36:41.970\n>> All right, well Sean,\na lot of great information there.\n\n1710\n01:36:41.970 --> 01:36:46.330\nWe talked about the pieces\nthat make up our cryptography.\n\n1711\n01:36:46.330 --> 01:36:48.470\nWe did a little review there,\nwe talked about some of the limits.\n\n1712\n01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:50.960\nWe went over Kerckhoffs's principle.\n\n1713\n01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:53.320\nTook a close look at a couple\nof the actual cyphers.\n\n1714\n01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:57.080\nWe looked at that Caesar Cypher,\nas well as the Vigenère.\n\n1715\n01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.640\nSo anything else we want to toss\nin before we wrap this episode?\n\n1716\n01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.030\n>> No, I think that was pretty cool.\n\n1717\n01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:08.260\nI found that neat, gave everyone some\ntime to try a couple of them out and\n\n1718\n01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:10.100\nsee what it looked like.\n\n1719\n01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:15.200\nMaybe give a little bit of a better\nappreciation of the process.\n\n1720\n01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:20.650\nAnd maybe it was a little bit of\na mental exercise to get you warmed up,\n\n1721\n01:37:20.650 --> 01:37:21.910\nwhich is great.\n\n1722\n01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:24.150\nSo I hope you enjoyed that.\n\n1723\n01:37:24.150 --> 01:37:26.950\nBut yeah, some good stuff and\nI think it was a good episode.\n\n1724\n01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:29.790\n>> All right, well I hope you\nguys enjoyed playing along.\n\n1725\n01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:31.650\nWe

00:00:37.030\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.780\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.980\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.010\n>> I am doing pretty good.\n\n7\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.860\nHow about you?\n\n8\n00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.960\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.785\nLooking forward to another exciting\nepisode in our cryptography series.\n\n10\n00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:51.725\nThis one we're gonna do algorithms and\nciphers.\n\n11\n00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:53.425\nSounds like a lot of fun, Sean.\n\n12\n00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:56.075\n>> Oh yeah, it can be, and\nthat's what we're gonna choose.\n\n13\n00:00:56.075 --> 00:01:00.940\nTry to do is keeping it nice and exciting,\nand keep the energy up for this one.\n\n14\n00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.710\nA lot of neat,\nreally neat stuff to cover here.\n\n15\n00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.100\nDifferent types of algorithms and\n\n16\n00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.270\nhow they fit together, some of the ways\nthat they work, history of them.\n\n17\n00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.080\nSome of those things are gonna\nkind of all come into play.\n\n18\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.800\nSo a lot of things to do,\na long path here.\n\n19\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.580\n>> So I guess the first thing we probably\nought to do is define algorithm and\n\n20\n00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.090\ndefine cipher.\n\n21\n00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.890\nA lot of us think of them as the same\nthing and being interchangeable.\n\n22\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.020\n>> Yes, that happens quite a bit, is that\nyou can use the terms interchangeably.\n\n23\n00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.085\nIn a lot of cases, that's just fine.\n\n24\n00:01:39.085 --> 00:01:43.390\nWhen I went to double-check\n\n25\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.890\nit when I wrote this book I did\na lot of research on it and\n\n26\n00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.580\nbecause it was really messed up I really\nneeded to kinda nail the term down.\n\n27\n00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.480\nBecause you could go\nto a lot of places and\n\n28\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.340\nyou'll see them use just back and\nforth, back and forth, back and forth.\n\n29\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.820\nAnd they're not the same thing really\nwhen you get down to the mechanics and\n\n30\n00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.990\nhow cryptography ticks, algorithm\nciphers do diverge from one another.\n\n31\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.880\nAn algorithm typically is referring\nto the whole formula, and\n\n32\n00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.560\nciphers will be individual building\nblocks within that formula.\n\n33\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.100\nAnd that tends to be what you see\nwhen you get further into it.\n\n34\n00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.980\nWhen you're not going that far,\nif you're talking just the basic stuff and\n\n35\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.270\neveryday things, you can probably use\nalgorithm cipher interchangeably and\n\n36\n00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.310\nno one's gonna say anything.\n\n37\n00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.060\nBut there are those differences\n\n38\n00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.350\nbetween the two if you do start really,\nreally, really digging in.\n\n39\n00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.216\nOne of the ones that I think\nabout is the C-I-S-S-P.\n\n40\n00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:50.087\nWhen you start going in CISSP,\nthe CISSP quite frequently goes back and\n\n41\n00:02:50.087 --> 00:02:52.080\nforth between the two.\n\n42\n00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.970\nAnd it's just kind of like, oh,\nlet's just use this a lot of times.\n\n43\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.290\nNow let's go over and use this one\nbecause we're overusing that term.\n\n44\n00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.930\nIt's like, okay, you're mis-applying\nthe term, but all right.\n\n45\n00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.840\nBut here, we're gonna make that\ndistinction that there is an algorithm,\n\n46\n00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.660\nand there is a cipher, and\nyou've already seen some cases where\n\n47\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.280\nthey've kind of sort of\nbeen used interchangeably.\n\n48\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.470\nNotice Caesar cipher.\n\n49\n00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.120\nThat is what it's called,\nthe Caesar cipher, but I went through and\n\n50\n00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.830\ncalled it an algorithm because I\nput the formula out there for it.\n\n51\n00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.890\nOkay, that actually works.\n\n52\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.320\nThere's also these things\ncalled the substitution cipher.\n\n53\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.094\nA substitution cipher and\ntransposition cipher,\n\n54\n00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:44.290\nthose things there's really\nnot a formula for them.\n\n55\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.810\nYou really can't quantify\nthem as an algorithm.\n\n56\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.290\nAn algorithm is a formula.\n\n57\n00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.130\nBut you can use the techniques\nof transposition in substitution\n\n58\n00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.260\nwithin an algorithm.\n\n59\n00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.411\nWhich is what the Caesar cipher does.\n\n60\n00:03:57.411 --> 00:04:01.375\nA Caesar cipher takes those techniques and\nplugs them in.\n\n61\n00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:04.222\nAnd says, okay, well,\nI'm going to substitute things, but\n\n62\n00:04:04.222 --> 00:04:08.060\nthis is specifically how I'm gonna\ncarry out that substitution.\n\n63\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.905\n>> I might generate an algorithm,\n\n64\n00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:14.360\nI might develop an algorithm that\nincludes many different ciphers in there.\n\n65\n00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.726\nI might do a little substitution here and\na little transposition there and add it\n\n66\n00:04:18.726 --> 00:04:23.435\nall up and I've got an algorithm, but the\nindividual pieces were actually ciphers.\n\n67\n00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:25.600\n>> Yeah, there's many that do that.\n\n68\n00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.170\nYou've got ones like\nthe Rijndael algorithm.\n\n69\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.050\nIt actually does multiple\nlevels of blocks.\n\n70\n00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.060\nSubstitutions and\ntranspositions inside of it.\n\n71\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.930\nThey were all just kind of thrown\ninto the pot and mixed together and\n\n72\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.240\nyou get the Rijndael with\na little other magic put in.\n\n73\n00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.930\nBut you get those all mixed in,\nyou get the Rijndael cipher.\n\n74\n00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.472\nSo they didn't just use\none Rijndael algorithm,\n\n75\n00:04:53.472 --> 00:04:57.619\nyou get all these things put\ntogether to form that system.\n\n76\n00:04:57.619 --> 00:05:02.456\nAnd it works quite effectively,\neven though those underlying techniques\n\n77\n00:05:02.456 --> 00:05:07.925\naren't really that strong unto themselves,\nbut put together much better.\n\n78\n00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:08.445\n>> Very good.\n\n79\n00:05:08.445 --> 00:05:09.175\nAll right.\n\n80\n00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:12.870\nSo we had an idea of what makes\nan algorithm, what makes a cipher, and\n\n81\n00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.163\nthen in the general sense a lot of times\nwe can use those terms interchangeably.\n\n82\n00:05:17.163 --> 00:05:20.662\nBut important that we really understand\nthe difference between them so\n\n83\n00:05:20.662 --> 00:05:23.225\nthat when needed we can be\nvery specific when we say,\n\n84\n00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:26.950\nokay, this is what a cipher is and\nthis is what an algorithm.\n\n85\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.760\n>> Yeah, and just be aware.\n\n86\n00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.350\nThey are used very much interchangeably.\n\n87\n00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.410\nIf you're at a very basic level, and\n\n88\n00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.910\njust starting out in it, you can get\naway with that backwards and forwards.\n\n89\n00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.220\nMost people will actually just\ngo ahead and use algorithm\n\n90\n00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.590\nunless they're specifically\ntold to use the term cipher or\n\n91\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.174\nif there's a specific technology\nthat's referred to as being a cipher,\n\n92\n00:05:55.174 --> 00:05:57.390\nthat's about it.\n\n93\n00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.390\nSo algorithm by far is\nthe dominant term but\n\n94\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.940\nthere actually are two\ndifferent terms there.\n\n95\n00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.970\nThere is algorithm, there is a cipher and\nthey do mean two different things.\n\n96\n00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.385\nYou got to kinda be careful with that\nif you get into it at some point.\n\n97\n00:06:11.385 --> 00:06:14.732\nAnd those that are going to\npursue this topic further,\n\n98\n00:06:14.732 --> 00:06:18.890\nwhich that might be what a good amount\nof our audience is going to do.\n\n99\n00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.717\nIf you are going to pursue this further,\nbe prepared,\n\n100\n00:06:21.717 --> 00:06:25.290\nyou're going to go into white papers for\ndifferent organizations.\n\n101\n00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.840\nI know Caltech has a bunch of them.\n\n102\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.000\nAs is MIT and a bunch of others.\n\n103\n00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.320\nAnd they will use those terms\nhow they're supposed to be used.\n\n104\n00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.390\nAnd so if you think they're same thing,\neverybody like whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n105\n00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.890\nWhat happened, what are they doing here?\n\n106\n00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.250\nYou have to remember they're\nreferring to two different\n\n107\n00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.320\nthings there that are related.\n\n108\n00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.950\nBut they're definitely not the same\nthing and just be careful.\n\n109\n00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:57.080\nWhen you see the two, that you do not\nget caught on one versus the other.\n\n110\n00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.415\n>> All right, and then when we talk about\ntypes of systems, we've mentioned these\n\n111\n00:07:01.415 --> 00:07:05.126\nterms already a couple of times,\nbut let's break those down again.\n\n112\n00:07:05.126 --> 00:07:09.040\nCuz during this episode, we're gonna\nreally dive into each one of these, and\n\n113\n00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.017\ndiscuss the differences and what makes\nthem tick, and what their strengths and\n\n114\n00:07:13.017 --> 00:07:14.220\nweaknesses are.\n\n115\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.010\nWell, let's start by just\ndefining these terms here.\n\n116\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:22.460\nYes, we do have to define what it is\nwe're going to be talking about here.\n\n117\n00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.604\nIn this particular when\nwe talk about algorithms,\n\n118\n00:07:25.604 --> 00:07:31.270\nwe're gonna be focusing on two types of\nalgorithms, symmetric and asymmetric.\n\n119\n00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:37.940\nAnd those are the two major types that\nare gonna be seen in the world nowadays.\n\n120\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.540\nNow, they come in a tremendous amount\nof different flavors out there.\n\n121\n00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.730\nSo it's not just one type of symmetric or\none type of asymmetric.\n\n122\n00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.380\nThere's many different ways to\ncarry those techniques out.\n\n123\n00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.125\nIt just depends on the specific\nalgorithm we're using to carry that out.\n\n124\n00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:58.824\nBut symmetric, one of the things they\nalso do tend to call it is they do\n\n125\n00:07:58.824 --> 00:08:01.021\ntend to call it in some circles.\n\n126\n00:08:01.021 --> 00:08:03.960\nClassic cryptography.\n\n127\n00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.351\nAnd if you look at it,\nsymmetric used one key to encrypt and\n\n128\n00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:11.590\nthey use the same key to decrypt.\n\n129\n00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:17.310\nThere's nothing that we've talked about so\nfar that doesn't fit that profile.\n\n130\n00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.020\nEverything fits that profile.\n\n131\n00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.812\nCaesar clearly does.\n\n132\n00:08:22.812 --> 00:08:25.341\nThe vignette one clearly does.\n\n133\n00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:28.581\nAnd even though it is\na little more complex,\n\n134\n00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:33.319\nyou clearly have that same key or\nkeyword being used to decrypt.\n\n135\n00:08:33.319 --> 00:08:36.371\nYou're not gonna be able\nto do it otherwise.\n\n136\n00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:39.598\nAnd there's plenty of other\nones that are in there.\n\n137\n00:08:39.598 --> 00:08:43.610\nIn fact, there's plenty of other ones\nthat have been lost over the years that\n\n138\n00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.280\nhave never been seen again or referenced.\n\n139\n00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.007\nBut there's a huge body of\nsymmetric algorithms that one\n\n140\n00:08:52.007 --> 00:08:56.153\nkey to encrypt and\nthe same key is used to decrypt.\n\n141\n00:08:56.153 --> 00:09:01.582\nSo, they're simple, they're easy,\nthey do have their drawbacks,\n\n142\n00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:06.013\nand that's why they later on,\ngot a cousin, or brother,\n\n143\n00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:11.907\nwhatever you wanna call it that helped\naddress another problem on it's own.\n\n144\n00:09:11.907 --> 00:09:15.389\nAnd the two can work\ntogether pretty effectively.\n\n145\n00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:21.330\nThose are the two main ones, but symmetric\nby far has the longer history and yeah.\n\n146\n00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:26.166\nIt's one of those, I find symmetric\ninteresting because there's a lot of\n\n147\n00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:31.003\njust peaks and all that of lost algorithms\nout there that people just don't\n\n148\n00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:34.760\nknow what they were and\nso they're kind of stuck.\n\n149\n00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.650\nIn fact, you can look.\n\n150\n00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.200\nIf you guys wanna look this one up\n\n151\n00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.040\nto get an idea one of the things\nthat happened along those lines.\n\n152\n00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.520\nThere was a symmetric cipher\nthat they used in France for\n\n153\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.240\na period of time called the Great Cipher.\n\n154\n00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.310\nIt was reported, at the time,\nto be unbreakable.\n\n155\n00:09:53.370 --> 00:10:00.590\nSo they used it for the royal court and\nall that, used it for quite a long time.\n\n156\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:06.010\nAnd so, there was records being kept that\nwere encrypted like this, and all sorts of\n\n157\n00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:10.570\nmessages and everything else being kept,\nthat were encoded with the Great Cipher.\n\n158\n00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:16.382\nBut at some point, they decided the Great\nCipher, well we're gonna stop using that.\n\n159\n00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:23.012\nSo, it started falling into lesser and\nlesser decreased usage over time.\n\n160\n00:10:23.012 --> 00:10:24.858\nAnd then it was not used at all.\n\n161\n00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:30.190\nBut there was one critical thing\nthat someone forgot along the way.\n\n162\n00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:36.291\nAnd that is,\nwhat's the key to reverse this?\n\n163\n00:10:36.291 --> 00:10:38.655\nAnd so, if memory serves,\neven to this day,\n\n164\n00:10:38.655 --> 00:10:42.827\nthere's still documents in the French\narchives that they don't know what they\n\n165\n00:10:42.827 --> 00:10:45.334\nsay because someone lost\nthe way to decrypt it.\n\n166\n00:10:45.334 --> 00:10:47.945\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe they've solved that,\n\n167\n00:10:47.945 --> 00:10:52.955\nbut that problem did exist for a period of\ntime, is that they had this really awesome\n\n168\n00:10:52.955 --> 00:10:58.980\ncipher that someone, some genius or\nwhatever came up with it.\n\n169\n00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:04.370\nAnd it was considered, like I said,\nfor that era to be unbreakable and\n\n170\n00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:09.710\nokay, well they found out how big of\na claim that was when all of a sudden,\n\n171\n00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:15.760\nthey have several years and decades and\nwhatever of records that they can't read.\n\n172\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.880\n>> Wow.\n[LAUGH] >> They're like what is this?\n\n173\n00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.390\nMaybe they've done it\nwith computing power.\n\n174\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.100\nI'm not sure about that.\n\n175\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.910\nBut yeah, that was the case,\nthat someone lost the knowledge and\n\n176\n00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.651\nkeys of how to use the system.\n\n177\n00:11:27.651 --> 00:11:28.950\nAnd oops.\n\n178\n00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.426\n>> Yeah, without the key,\n\n179\n00:11:30.426 --> 00:11:35.018\nit's gonna be a little difficult to get\nback into that information without.\n\n180\n00:11:35.018 --> 00:11:37.103\nI guess you pretty much just have\nto brute force it that point.\n\n181\n00:11:37.103 --> 00:11:41.924\n>> Yeah and I guess the system was\ndesigned so well that brute forcing,\n\n182\n00:11:41.924 --> 00:11:46.844\nwhile it can be done with any system,\nit was gonna be insanely tough.\n\n183\n00:11:46.844 --> 00:11:50.888\nAnd just everything else you could say\nwith a level of technology they had at\n\n184\n00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:51.540\nthat time.\n\n185\n00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.343\nAnd so now-\n>> [CROSSTALK] space and\n\n186\n00:11:54.343 --> 00:11:57.728\nthat's gonna take a long time\n>> Yeah, and so they had a big,\n\n187\n00:11:57.728 --> 00:11:59.790\nbig problem on their hands.\n\n188\n00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:06.880\nSo it's almost like a period of time in\ntheir archives, just, it's a black hole.\n\n189\n00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.780\nNothing happened in France for\nthat period of time.\n\n190\n00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.680\nSo, but it also,\nto talk about something from\n\n191\n00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.950\nthe previous episode,\nthat's kind of Kirkoff's Principle too.\n\n192\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.310\nIt kind of fits in there.\n\n193\n00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:24.025\nIt's something that should be\ndocumented and easy to use, but\n\n194\n00:12:24.025 --> 00:12:28.400\nit would also kind of address this\nwhole thing of what happened?\n\n195\n00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.960\nWhy wasn't that documented?\n\n196\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.570\nWhat happened to all of these things?\n\n197\n00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.580\nWhy wasn't it easy to use?\n\n198\n00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.400\nThat was a problem that they encountered.\n\n199\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.048\nI don't think they're the only\nones that had that issue.\n\n200\n00:12:42.048 --> 00:12:47.330\nThey're one of the better known cases,\nbut I know their not the only one.\n\n201\n00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.310\nThere's been other situations\nwhere they're like, oops.\n\n202\n00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.740\n>> I won't tell you about the files that\nI have that I do not have the key for\n\n203\n00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.940\nanymore, and I'm not getting into them.\n\n204\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.291\nBut I still have them just in case.\n\n205\n00:12:57.291 --> 00:13:00.360\n[LAUGH]\n>> Did you do the EFS thing too?\n\n206\n00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.650\n>> Yeah.\n\n207\n00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.740\n>> Yeah, there's-\n>> I swore I backed up those keys to\n\n208\n00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.560\nmy thumb drive.\n\n209\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.490\nNo idea what thumb drive and\nwhere that darn thing is, so yeah.\n\n210\n00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.899\nThey're just sitting there encrypted.\n\n211\n00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:13.299\n>> You need to get your hands\non Access FTK, it can do that.\n\n212\n00:13:13.299 --> 00:13:14.019\nIt can break them.\n\n213\n00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:14.770\n>> I'm gonna work on that.\n\n214\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.600\nAfter doing our DFI show,\nour digital forensic investigator,\n\n215\n00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.820\nI'm definitely gonna be working on that.\n\n216\n00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.520\n>> That's exactly one of the things, it's\ngot a feature built in that does that.\n\n217\n00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.760\nSo yeah, you should be doing that.\n\n218\n00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.110\nBut yeah, you're not the only one.\n\n219\n00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.795\nI think everyone that did stuff\nwith EFS initially, was like oh,\n\n220\n00:13:30.795 --> 00:13:32.770\nthis is really neat and then oops.\n\n221\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.365\n[LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely no reason for it.\n\n222\n00:13:35.365 --> 00:13:37.158\nIt's my own personal computer at home.\n\n223\n00:13:37.158 --> 00:13:39.247\nIt's a spreadsheet that I\nkeep my bill information on.\n\n224\n00:13:39.247 --> 00:13:40.187\n>> Yeah, see.\n\n225\n00:13:40.187 --> 00:13:41.630\nChris has done it too.\n\n226\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.000\nBut I thought what the heck,\nI've got great physical security, but\n\n227\n00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.785\nwhat the heck, why not do a little EFS?\n\n228\n00:13:45.785 --> 00:13:47.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, Yeah.\n\n229\n00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.301\nAnd then reinstall the operating\nsystem a dozen times, and\n\n230\n00:13:50.301 --> 00:13:52.983\nno idea what key was used or\nanything, what certificates.\n\n231\n00:13:52.983 --> 00:13:54.167\nYeah.\n\n232\n00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:54.945\nLive and learn.\n\n233\n00:13:54.945 --> 00:13:57.162\n>> That's how you learn.\n\n234\n00:13:57.162 --> 00:13:58.928\nIt's like, don't do that again.\n\n235\n00:13:58.928 --> 00:14:02.399\n>> [LAUGH] I did try one,\ntwo, three, four, five, six,\n\n236\n00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:04.826\nas a matter of fact and that was not it.\n\n237\n00:14:04.826 --> 00:14:08.207\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nwe've got symmetric, or classical,\n\n238\n00:14:08.207 --> 00:14:12.603\nwhich means I probably have something\na little newer, a little more modern,\n\n239\n00:14:12.603 --> 00:14:15.480\nif we're gonna call that one classical.\n\n240\n00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.740\n>> Yeah, we have the more\nmodern one which is asymmetric.\n\n241\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:26.140\nAsymmetric or what they also call public\nkey, is something that was designed within\n\n242\n00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:32.000\nthe last 40 to 50 years is when\nthis is really coming to use.\n\n243\n00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.290\nAnd it really only came into\nuse because computing power\n\n244\n00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.740\ngot to the point where\nthis was practical to do.\n\n245\n00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:44.147\nIt was actually suggested just a little\nbit here and there, before then.\n\n246\n00:14:44.147 --> 00:14:49.085\nBut no one had really put\ntogether a practical paper and\n\n247\n00:14:49.085 --> 00:14:54.247\nanalysis on it until about the late 60s,\nearly 70s.\n\n248\n00:14:54.247 --> 00:14:56.709\nI wanna say the 70s is when\nthe paper was written.\n\n249\n00:14:56.709 --> 00:14:59.924\nOn it that said, hey,\nthis is how you do this.\n\n250\n00:14:59.924 --> 00:15:04.363\nAnd so, we started seeing,\nafter that practical white\n\n251\n00:15:04.363 --> 00:15:08.989\npaper was put out here in the US,\nit got to the community and\n\n252\n00:15:08.989 --> 00:15:15.240\nthen you started seeing this growth\nof all these asymmetric algorithms.\n\n253\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.603\nWhich asymmetric is characterized\nby the fact that it has two keys,\n\n254\n00:15:20.603 --> 00:15:26.546\nwhen you enroll in the system, you get\na key pair, you don't have one key.\n\n255\n00:15:26.546 --> 00:15:31.205\nYou get two keys that\nare mathematically related, and\n\n256\n00:15:31.205 --> 00:15:37.389\nyou keep one as secret, either to\nyourself or to a small group of people.\n\n257\n00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:42.086\nAnd then the other one is something\nthat everyone else gets access to with\n\n258\n00:15:42.086 --> 00:15:44.720\nlittle or no restriction.\n\n259\n00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.877\nAnd that's the big,\nbig defining thing with it.\n\n260\n00:15:48.877 --> 00:15:55.657\nThe reason why it took a while for\nthese things to actually get developed and\n\n261\n00:15:55.657 --> 00:15:59.746\nbe practical is because without computers,\n\n262\n00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:03.633\nit becomes very, very, very tough to do.\n\n263\n00:16:03.633 --> 00:16:07.539\nYou're talking,\nwhen you get into asymmetric systems,\n\n264\n00:16:07.539 --> 00:16:13.020\nyou're talking very, very high order\nmath and very complex transformations.\n\n265\n00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:19.610\nAnd all sorts of just interesting things\nhappening that without that computer\n\n266\n00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:25.420\nbehind you doing it it, it becomes nearly\nimpractical, if not fully impractical.\n\n267\n00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.562\nYou've got to know to\nwork with these things.\n\n268\n00:16:27.562 --> 00:16:32.508\nYou've got to know logarithms and\nall those things that you may have heard\n\n269\n00:16:32.508 --> 00:16:37.390\nof in school, but never used since\nthen and a whole bunch of other stuff.\n\n270\n00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:43.300\nYou can imagine someone 50s,\n60s, 70s even,\n\n271\n00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:48.390\ntrying to break out that slide rule and\ndo all this stuff.\n\n272\n00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:52.433\nIt's just not gonna happen, at least\nnot in a practical period of time.\n\n273\n00:16:52.433 --> 00:16:56.047\n>> Maybe if I wanted to send one word or\nsomething I might be able to get through\n\n274\n00:16:56.047 --> 00:16:58.980\nthat, but what if I've got\nan entire document to encrypt?\n\n275\n00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.775\n>> Ain't happening.\n\n276\n00:16:59.775 --> 00:17:04.170\n>> Try to do that manually using\nasymmetric, it's just not gonna work.\n\n277\n00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:10.600\n>> Yeah, it just ain't happening,\nso it was something that was just\n\n278\n00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:17.390\na twinkle in someone's eye\nuntil it came into use.\n\n279\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:24.140\nOr they had the white papers written on\nit and last 40 to 50 years that was it.\n\n280\n00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:29.966\nBasically, the stuff you heard before that\nwas hinting towards asymmetric algorithms,\n\n281\n00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:32.266\nwas people looking at symmetric and\n\n282\n00:17:32.266 --> 00:17:36.186\nrealizing that there were\nproblems distributing that key.\n\n283\n00:17:36.186 --> 00:17:40.091\nThen they figured out that well,\nyou're gonna encrypt something,\n\n284\n00:17:40.091 --> 00:17:43.738\nnow I got to have an out of band\nmechanism to distribute that key.\n\n285\n00:17:43.738 --> 00:17:47.903\nAnd that is very problematic,\nthat's a lot of extra overhead and\n\n286\n00:17:47.903 --> 00:17:50.420\njumping through hoops I got to do.\n\n287\n00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.576\nSo people were thinking about this,\n\n288\n00:17:52.576 --> 00:17:57.105\nwouldn't it be great if we could have\na key assigned to somebody and all that.\n\n289\n00:17:57.105 --> 00:18:01.557\nI had all these ideas, and then it was\nformally written down and documented in\n\n290\n00:18:01.557 --> 00:18:06.092\nthe problems with it were mathematical,\nproblems behind it were worked out.\n\n291\n00:18:06.092 --> 00:18:12.790\nAnd now we have these asymmetric\nsystems all over the place.\n\n292\n00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:17.148\nAnd I want to say that,\nwas it Diffy Helmet and\n\n293\n00:18:17.148 --> 00:18:20.950\nanother guy had actually worked on it.\n\n294\n00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.903\nNames you may have heard\nactually worked on this.\n\n295\n00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:27.326\nAnd those guys are are still around, too.\n\n296\n00:18:27.326 --> 00:18:29.886\nSo you can thank them if you see them.\n\n297\n00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:32.366\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's funny to see them in the pictures\n\n298\n00:18:32.366 --> 00:18:34.077\nnext to the paper,\ncuz now they're kind of clean.\n\n299\n00:18:34.077 --> 00:18:38.513\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're kind of somewhat cleaned up and\n\n300\n00:18:38.513 --> 00:18:39.524\nlook normal.\n\n301\n00:18:39.524 --> 00:18:41.761\nBack then, I mean, the hippie look, man.\n\n302\n00:18:41.761 --> 00:18:43.531\n>> It's the 70s.\n\n303\n00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:48.764\n>> Yeah, you almost want to think that\nthese guys were like doing something and\n\n304\n00:18:48.764 --> 00:18:50.085\ncame up with this.\n\n305\n00:18:50.085 --> 00:18:51.114\nYou can almost see it happen.\n\n306\n00:18:51.114 --> 00:18:52.277\n>> Are you saying their mind might have\n\n307\n00:18:52.277 --> 00:18:54.187\nbeen a little expanded when\nthey were coming up with this.\n\n308\n00:18:54.187 --> 00:18:56.151\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n309\n00:18:56.151 --> 00:18:58.109\n>> That's exactly what I'm saying.\n\n310\n00:18:58.109 --> 00:19:01.790\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nwe've got these types of systems.\n\n311\n00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.190\nWe've got symmetric, we've got asymmetric.\n\n312\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:09.170\nSymmetric or classic, where there's\na single key, that key is responsible for\n\n313\n00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:12.580\ndoing the encryption as\nwell as the decryption.\n\n314\n00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.190\nAnd then you got your more modern\nencryption algorithms that are using\n\n315\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.540\nwhat we call an asymmetric system.\n\n316\n00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.470\nWhere I've got a key pair or\nmathematically related keys and\n\n317\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.320\nthey work together to do\nthe encryption and the decryption.\n\n318\n00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.610\nOne will do the encryption, the other\none then would do the decryption.\n\n319\n00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:33.210\nWe're gonna break all those down in much\nmore detail as we go through this episode.\n\n320\n00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.580\nSo let's talk about a little history\nof the development of these guys.\n\n321\n00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.160\n>> Yeah, I think it's worthwhile to talk\nabout the development of these things,\n\n322\n00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.890\nthese algorithms.\n\n323\n00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:46.930\nBecause they have gone through so\nmany changes over the years.\n\n324\n00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:51.270\nYou look at symmetric, symmetric's been\nbumped up substantially over the years.\n\n325\n00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.740\nSymmetric is still very much used.\n\n326\n00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.210\nIt's just that the complexity of\nthe algorithms has kept more or\n\n327\n00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.260\nless pace with the times.\n\n328\n00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:06.100\nWe went from things like Caesar cypher,\n\n329\n00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.340\nthings kinda sorta like hieroglyphics,\nthat type of deal,\n\n330\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.930\nto now we have things like AES and\neven stronger ones than that.\n\n331\n00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:21.550\nThere's a whole bunch of them out their in\nthe wild, they've evolved tremendously.\n\n332\n00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:26.250\nSo, we see that,\nsame thing with asymmetric.\n\n333\n00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.380\nAsymmetric has evolved quite a bit.\n\n334\n00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.250\nIt's evolved as a solution\nto problems that we\n\n335\n00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:39.040\nwith cryptography before with symmetric,\nand\n\n336\n00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.270\nit's also addressed some new problems\nthat were being seen in the field.\n\n337\n00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.090\nSo, we're seeing this\ncontinuing evolution.\n\n338\n00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.900\nOne of the big things you gotta\nremember from yesterday, and\n\n339\n00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.370\nwe're bring up again today is that\nthe evolution of these technologies\n\n340\n00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.630\nis also very much been a case\nof the technology gets better.\n\n341\n00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.670\nThe computing technology gets better.\n\n342\n00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:06.220\nThey kind of have to push out things\na little further, so they're out of reach,\n\n343\n00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.630\nor out of practical reach of computers.\n\n344\n00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:13.550\nAnd that little cat and mouse game is\ngonna go on for the foreseeable future.\n\n345\n00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:18.990\nYou really can't see an end to that\nsituation as they get more and\n\n346\n00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.090\nmore powerful computers.\n\n347\n00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.056\nThey have to get more and\nmore powerful algorithms.\n\n348\n00:21:22.056 --> 00:21:25.640\nSo the development's gonna be ongoing, and\n\n349\n00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.710\nthere's always gonna be some\nalgorithms being tested or\n\n350\n00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:35.210\nput out there, and in fact, there's\nvarious websites you can find this on.\n\n351\n00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:41.250\nThere's thousands, I want to say\nalgorithms, in both categories.\n\n352\n00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.069\nAnd it's interesting to poke\naround at some of these,\n\n353\n00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:47.945\nbecause you're kind of like,\nI've never heard of this one, or that one.\n\n354\n00:21:47.945 --> 00:21:49.576\nAnd what the heck is that?\n\n355\n00:21:49.576 --> 00:21:53.219\nA lot of them are ones that were either\nproof of concept, to see if you can do it.\n\n356\n00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.910\nAnd they were just never picked up.\n\n357\n00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:01.500\nSome of them were put out there with\nthe idea that they would be viable\n\n358\n00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.980\nalgorithms to put out there in the wild.\n\n359\n00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.380\nBut what happened is, is that when\nthey put them out in the wild for\n\n360\n00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:12.230\na review, they were banged on and\nbeat on and they found out that,\n\n361\n00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:17.130\nyeah there's a problem here and\nit's something that is irreparable.\n\n362\n00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.820\nIt's a catastrophic thing,\nso we just have to ditch it.\n\n363\n00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:21.760\nSo that's happened.\n\n364\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.700\nYou can go on to Wikipedia and see a whole\nlist of things under symmetric algorithms\n\n365\n00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.878\nif you wanted, and do research on those,\nand figure out what happened to them.\n\n366\n00:22:30.878 --> 00:22:36.770\nLike I said, there's other ones that\ndo just kind of emerge from all that.\n\n367\n00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:41.667\nAnd survive the whole process and\nare used, and are still used.\n\n368\n00:22:41.667 --> 00:22:46.399\nSome of these older algorithms that were\nput out there, are still being used today,\n\n369\n00:22:46.399 --> 00:22:47.810\nif you can believe that.\n\n370\n00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.260\nSome of them,\nas computing powers picked up,\n\n371\n00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:55.690\nthey've retained their durability and\npersistence over all that time.\n\n372\n00:22:55.690 --> 00:23:00.540\nOne of the ones that you can\nvery easily point out is RSA,\n\n373\n00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.570\nwhich is an asymmetric,\nor public, key algorithm.\n\n374\n00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.740\nThat was developed way back.\n\n375\n00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.880\nWe're talking like 70s way back,\n\n376\n00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.940\nit was developed, it's still being\nused today, because it works.\n\n377\n00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.960\nIt hasn't really shown any\nappreciable degradation in security,\n\n378\n00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.240\nso they said, keep using it.\n\n379\n00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.930\nIt gets reviewed, of course, but it\nreally hasn't shown any major problems or\n\n380\n00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:29.905\nholes that would make it so\nit has to be replaced.\n\n381\n00:23:29.905 --> 00:23:34.205\nIt will at some point, but\nthat some point hasn't arrived yet.\n\n382\n00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:37.690\n>> Yeah, and a lot of these they can\nextend the lifetime of these algorithms by\n\n383\n00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.570\nincreasing the key space, right?\n\n384\n00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:43.700\nWhere they might have started out with\nsomething that was only supported 56 bit,\n\n385\n00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.700\nor something like that.\n\n386\n00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.870\nWhich has been proven to\nnot be lengthy enough,\n\n387\n00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:53.860\nnot be strong enough, they can modify\nthat algorithm to support 128 or 256.\n\n388\n00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.607\n>> And that can then increase\nthe lifetime of that algorithm.\n\n389\n00:23:56.607 --> 00:23:58.277\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n390\n00:23:58.277 --> 00:24:02.821\nThey even have ones now, to keep on with\nthat theme, they even have ones that\n\n391\n00:24:02.821 --> 00:24:07.652\nthey've started designing That are,\nyou could kinda sorta say they're future\n\n392\n00:24:07.652 --> 00:24:12.268\nproof, where what they do is they design\nthe algorithm and they design it with\n\n393\n00:24:12.268 --> 00:24:17.098\na component model in mind, which is where\nthey can pull out individual pieces and\n\n394\n00:24:17.098 --> 00:24:22.140\nreplace them with something that upgrades\nthat feature to make it stronger.\n\n395\n00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.080\nAnd so it's really fascinating when\nyou look at some of these that\n\n396\n00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.230\nare designed with that in mind that they\ncan have the algorithm, hand it to you and\n\n397\n00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.250\nyou can use it and it's strong and\nif something comes down the road and\n\n398\n00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.980\nthey say well, we're kind of worried,\n\n399\n00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:40.430\nwe're feeling a little heat in the back\nof neck here that's breakable,\n\n400\n00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.420\nthe person that designed it can say okay,\nwell here, I'm just going to take\n\n401\n00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:49.360\nthis piece out and extend it with this\nhere by tweaking this formula or whatever.\n\n402\n00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.920\nAnd boom, all of a sudden\nyou got a stronger algorithm\n\n403\n00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.130\nwithout having to rewrite\nthe whole algorithm.\n\n404\n00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:58.140\nThe cool thing about that is,\nis if you can replace the modules inside\n\n405\n00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.410\nthe algorithm without\nchanging the interfaces and\n\n406\n00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.320\nwhat's provided on either side.\n\n407\n00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.900\nYou may be able to pop in an algorithm\nto a piece of software or\n\n408\n00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.850\nhardware and be able to,\nonce it's popped in there,\n\n409\n00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:16.678\njust replace that component to\na firmware upgrade or software patch,\n\n410\n00:25:16.678 --> 00:25:19.530\nand everything still works\nthe same without breaking.\n\n411\n00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.570\nSo, they've really thought ahead and\n\n412\n00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:26.150\ngot their act together and\nit's fascinating that they've done that.\n\n413\n00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.941\nNow they have hashing algorithm that\ndo that a lot that they can just\n\n414\n00:25:29.941 --> 00:25:31.960\nrip modules out and replace them.\n\n415\n00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.880\nThe Shaw family is one of them that\nthey designed with that in mind.\n\n416\n00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.280\nReally cool.\n\n417\n00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.685\nWay above my pay grade.\n\n418\n00:25:38.685 --> 00:25:39.986\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I can say it's cool\n\n419\n00:25:39.986 --> 00:25:41.481\nat least without looking stupid.\n\n420\n00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:42.420\n>> Absolutely.\n\n421\n00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.880\nAnd we got a question in the chat room.\n\n422\n00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.300\nI don't know if we can get, let's see.\n\n423\n00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.300\nHow many do you think are kept private for\npersonal business?\n\n424\n00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:53.230\nI know you mentioned one or two, the\nproprietary algorithms that are out there.\n\n425\n00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:54.860\nI don't know if we can really say,\n\n426\n00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.400\nbecause if they are private\nwe might not know about them.\n\n427\n00:25:58.439 --> 00:26:01.515\n>> Yeah, it's kinda hard to say.\n\n428\n00:26:01.515 --> 00:26:08.061\nI would think about 2.3- 2.4 million.\n\n429\n00:26:08.061 --> 00:26:10.831\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I get that number from the bureau of\n\n430\n00:26:10.831 --> 00:26:12.496\nstuff I really have no clue about.\n\n431\n00:26:12.496 --> 00:26:17.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In all seriousness, it's tough.\n\n432\n00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.850\nPeople that keep them private,\nwe talk about the NSA and\n\n433\n00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.270\nyou've got equivalent\nagencies all over the world.\n\n434\n00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:26.780\n>> Yeah.\n\n435\n00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.390\n>> That do that.\n\n436\n00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.030\nThey don't talk about that.\n\n437\n00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:33.070\nThey just, plain and simple,\ndo not talk about those things.\n\n438\n00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.193\n>> So a lot of the governments probably\nhave their own algorithms that they might\n\n439\n00:26:36.193 --> 00:26:38.836\nuse in house for stuff,\nthat's not publicly available, that,\n\n440\n00:26:38.836 --> 00:26:40.570\nyeah no way for us to really know.\n\n441\n00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:43.310\n>> Yeah it's really, really tough.\n\n442\n00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:49.240\nJust kind of to factor some stuff into\nthat, you would think with what we talked\n\n443\n00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:55.090\nabout during this course already\nabout Kerckhoff's principle saying,\n\n444\n00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:59.060\nwell, wouldn't they want something\nthat they created to be scrutinized?\n\n445\n00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:06.020\nIf you look just at the NSA alone,\nNSA, yeah, I'm sure they want\n\n446\n00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:11.880\ntheir stuff scrutinized, but they've got a\nlot of smart people on their payroll that\n\n447\n00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.970\nthey've got enough peers and people to-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n448\n00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.760\n>> They don't need to sit at any place\n\n449\n00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.910\nwhatsoever.\n\n450\n00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:23.950\nI know there's been at least\na couple cases over time that\n\n451\n00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:29.690\nthey were someone,\nin fact I can think of one Specifically,\n\n452\n00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:35.020\nwhere there was a new algorithm\nintroduced into the public.\n\n453\n00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:40.900\nAnd the NSA, basically quietly said to us,\nyeah, we knew about that ten years ago.\n\n454\n00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.230\n>> But just for a while.\n\n455\n00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:46.260\n>> Yeah, they were already using that, it\nwas just because, yeah, it got revealed,\n\n456\n00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.520\nand it just same out on the down low,\nlike, yeah, we already did that.\n\n457\n00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.022\nBut, nice to see you made it.\n\n458\n00:27:51.022 --> 00:27:52.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n459\n00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:53.850\n>> Glad you caught up.\n\n460\n00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.749\n>> Yeah, that's the type of thing.\n\n461\n00:27:55.749 --> 00:27:56.960\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n462\n00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.746\nAll right, well I'll tell you what, ladies\nand gentlemen, looking at the clock,\n\n463\n00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:01.450\nit's about time for\nus to take one of those breaks.\n\n464\n00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.440\nSo we're gonna step away.\n\n465\n00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.503\nWhen we come back,\nmore on algorithms and ciphers.\n\n466\n00:28:06.503 --> 00:28:09.672\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n467\n00:28:09.672 --> 00:28:14.088\n[SOUND] All right, welcome\n\n468\n00:28:14.088 --> 00:28:18.909\nback ladies and gentlemen.\n\n469\n00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:21.440\nSo continuing on with our algorithms and\nciphers.\n\n470\n00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.860\nGetting ready to break down,\nwe've mentioned Sean,\n\n471\n00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.870\ntowards the beginning of this episode we\ntalked about symmetric algorithms and\n\n472\n00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.330\nasymmetric algorithms and kind of give\nyou a general idea about the differences.\n\n473\n00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:35.080\nBut now we wanna break them\ndown a little bit further and\n\n474\n00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.340\nreally look at the way they work and\nthe strengths and\n\n475\n00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.370\nthe weaknesses of those two different\nmethods that we can use there.\n\n476\n00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.060\n>> Yes both have their strengths and\nweaknesses,\n\n477\n00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:49.560\nthere really is no at this time,\nthere is no one size fits all solution.\n\n478\n00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:54.570\nIt's not hey you can pick this algorithm,\nit's going to take care of all your needs.\n\n479\n00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.950\nWhat you have to do is\nlook at what your need is.\n\n480\n00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.880\nAnd find an algorithm or\n\n481\n00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:05.270\nalgorithms that will come together\nto give you a solution that works.\n\n482\n00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:09.210\nSo all have their shortcomings, all have\ntheir strengths, and you just kind of try\n\n483\n00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:14.790\nto figure out the complementary solution\nis for your specific situation.\n\n484\n00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:16.090\nSo do remember that.\n\n485\n00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.060\nSo symmetric is definitely\none of those cases.\n\n486\n00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:23.340\nIt does have a lot of strengths,\nbut it also has weaknesses\n\n487\n00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.375\nthat we need to make sure we're\naware of to make the best choice.\n\n488\n00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:29.230\n>> Mm-hm, exactly, exactly.\n\n489\n00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:32.250\nAll right, so\nlet's start with symmetric then.\n\n490\n00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:36.810\n>> Yeah, symmetric,\njust to kind of make sure we've got\n\n491\n00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:42.330\neverything laid out here,\n>> Symmetric is an easy one.\n\n492\n00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:46.840\nIt means we have the plain text and\nwe're converting it to cypher text, and\n\n493\n00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.390\nwe have that algorithm in between.\n\n494\n00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:54.060\nAnd that algorithm defines that key space,\nand that key that we choose is gonna be\n\n495\n00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:58.590\nused to convert our plain\ntext via the algorithm.\n\n496\n00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:02.000\nTo our cypher text if you need\nto go back to the other way\n\n497\n00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.990\nuse the exact same key to\ngo back the other way.\n\n498\n00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:06.405\nThink you even had a diagram on-\n>> I do.\n\n499\n00:30:06.405 --> 00:30:07.498\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> If we want to pull that one up\n\n500\n00:30:07.498 --> 00:30:08.192\nthere real quick.\n\n501\n00:30:08.192 --> 00:30:13.173\n>> If it helps you visualize that just\na bit better, so just remember that is\n\n502\n00:30:13.173 --> 00:30:17.830\nthe important thing is that we have\n>> One to go to\n\n503\n00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.820\none to we use a key to encrypt and\nwe have a key to decrypt.\n\n504\n00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:27.400\nAnd you can see right here on this diagram\nwe have the encryption process up top,\n\n505\n00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.990\nthe decryption process down bottom, and\n\n506\n00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.260\nthen you've got the key\nright there in the middle.\n\n507\n00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.840\nThat'll be used on both\nsides of the operation.\n\n508\n00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.340\n>> So one key to rule them all basically.\n\n509\n00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.827\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n510\n00:30:40.827 --> 00:30:41.767\n>> I had to throw that in there.\n\n511\n00:30:41.767 --> 00:30:42.752\nRight?\n\n512\n00:30:42.752 --> 00:30:46.690\nAll right, so that's symmetric,\nthe same key used for both sides for\n\n513\n00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.890\nthe encryption as well as the decryption.\n\n514\n00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.120\nAnd then we can break symmetric\ndown even further and\n\n515\n00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.900\nthe methods that it's using\nto do that encryption.\n\n516\n00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:55.460\nRight?\n\n517\n00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:01.880\n>> Yes, that's the other part of this is,\nwe've said before, not all\n\n518\n00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:06.360\ncryptographic algorithms are created equal\nand they do have different mechanics and\n\n519\n00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:11.400\ndifferent things happening underneath the\nhood, and inside with all the details, so\n\n520\n00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.850\nwhat we've got here is, when we talk\nabout symmetric we have block and stream\n\n521\n00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:20.300\nciphers, and those are something that had\nbeen mentioned in a previous episode,\n\n522\n00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.688\nbut let's clear them up once more.\n\n523\n00:31:24.688 --> 00:31:29.840\nA stream cipher is just one that\nworks on a bit by bit basis.\n\n524\n00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.730\nYou just grab something,\ngrab a chunk of information.\n\n525\n00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.770\nSends it through the meat grinder and\ncomes out and it's something new.\n\n526\n00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:41.770\nAnd it just keeps rinses,\nrepeating that process until you're done.\n\n527\n00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:44.584\n>> I always think it's like\na choo choo train or something,\n\n528\n00:31:44.584 --> 00:31:48.456\nwhere each character or each bit really,\nin that message or whatever it is that\n\n529\n00:31:48.456 --> 00:31:52.584\nyou're trying to encrypt, picture or what\nhave you, is fed through one at a time.\n\n530\n00:31:52.584 --> 00:31:57.567\nSo one bit goes in, one bit comes out,\nnext bit goes in, next bit comes out.\n\n531\n00:31:57.567 --> 00:32:00.260\nThat's the way those stream\nciphers are gonna work.\n\n532\n00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.548\nIt's like Thunderdome.\n\n533\n00:32:01.548 --> 00:32:03.208\n>> [LAUGH] That's great.\n\n534\n00:32:03.208 --> 00:32:04.544\nWell, that's up, that's two.\n\n535\n00:32:04.544 --> 00:32:07.140\n>> Two go in, one come out.\n\n536\n00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:07.754\n>> Yeah, yeah, very similar.\n\n537\n00:32:07.754 --> 00:32:10.394\n>> So, yeah.\n\n538\n00:32:10.394 --> 00:32:14.024\n>> And then block, though,\nworks a little bit differently.\n\n539\n00:32:14.024 --> 00:32:17.460\nInstead of taking one bit at a time,\nwhat are we gonna do with a block cipher?\n\n540\n00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:21.810\n>> Well, a block, the name's got\nit really encapsulated nicely.\n\n541\n00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:26.550\nA block means it's taking whatever you\ninput, chopping it into chunks and\n\n542\n00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.815\noffering each chunk individually.\n\n543\n00:32:28.815 --> 00:32:35.200\nAnd then is just spits those\nout as it goes through.\n\n544\n00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.420\nAnd so the thing about blocks\nis to remember that blocks\n\n545\n00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:45.240\noperate on chunks of information,\nnot individual bits.\n\n546\n00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:51.500\nAnd those blocks are all fixed in size by\nthe algorithm, so that would be point one.\n\n547\n00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.590\nPoint two is that you\nnever have an empty block.\n\n548\n00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:59.270\nSo if you have a block size,\nlike I was using yesterday of four,\n\n549\n00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.220\nif you only have two bits to put in there,\nthe algorithm isn't going to say, oh,\n\n550\n00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.370\nwell, there's two bits in there,\nI'm gonna just take that and send it off.\n\n551\n00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:09.400\nNo, the algorithm's gonna say that\nthere needs to be padding in there, so\n\n552\n00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.860\nit's designed to shove a couple extra bits\nin there to bring the total up to four,\n\n553\n00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:20.340\nand then it will go ahead and encrypt\nthat whole block to complete the process.\n\n554\n00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:24.920\nSo that's another important\ndetail of how blocks work.\n\n555\n00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:30.800\nAnd just to kinda compare and contrast\nthe two, up and above how they operate,\n\n556\n00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.740\nthere's been discussion on when it's\nbetter to have an algorithm that employs\n\n557\n00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:42.710\nstream versus an algorithm\nthat employs a block method.\n\n558\n00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:47.920\nWell, the feeling tends to be, and you can\ntake this with a little bit of a grain of\n\n559\n00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.960\nsalt because there's still some discussion\ngoing on, is that if you don't know\n\n560\n00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.150\nthe size of the information coming\nyour way, then a stream is gonna\n\n561\n00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:03.320\nbe better suited for\nthat because it operates at the bit level.\n\n562\n00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.230\nIt doesn't care.\n\n563\n00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:06.410\nAs the stuff goes through,\nit just keeps encrypting it,\n\n564\n00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.710\nand it just keeps going right on through.\n\n565\n00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:14.490\nWhereas, if you have a block cipher,\nor block-based algorithm,\n\n566\n00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:19.170\nthat works on information\nthat you know the size of, so\n\n567\n00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:22.580\nit can very quickly just chop it in and\ngo right on through.\n\n568\n00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:27.230\nThere's still some discussion of just how\nmuch of an impact that really makes, but\n\n569\n00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:32.350\nit is a discussion that's being had,\nnonetheless.\n\n570\n00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:37.037\nYou could argue that there's some\nlogic there in that with the two in\n\n571\n00:34:37.037 --> 00:34:38.660\nthe way they operate.\n\n572\n00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.320\n>> We look at things like if we\nthink back to Network Plus and\n\n573\n00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.250\nsome of our networking technologies\nthat use fixed packet sizes\n\n574\n00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:49.170\nare really more efficient at transmitting\nthat data across these routers\n\n575\n00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.290\nbecause they know when the end\nof the block is coming or\n\n576\n00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.570\nwhen that packet is coming cuz there's\nalways gonna be the same size every time.\n\n577\n00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:56.310\nBut they also have to\nadd padding in there.\n\n578\n00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:00.280\nSame thing happens with these block and\nstream ciphers.\n\n579\n00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:06.140\nNow, one thing I know about streams,\nif you're processing one bit at a time,\n\n580\n00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.460\nwhat can happen is we start seeing\na little bit of pattern emerging\n\n581\n00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.790\non the other side because\nevery time the letter,\n\n582\n00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:17.355\nt, goes through, the same character's\ngonna come out on the other side.\n\n583\n00:35:17.355 --> 00:35:19.385\nSo, you start to see some repetition,\n\n584\n00:35:19.385 --> 00:35:22.995\nsome pattern and supposedly that makes\nit a little bit easier for the guys that\n\n585\n00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:27.595\nare doing the cryptanalysis with those\nstream ciphers is that repetition.\n\n586\n00:35:27.595 --> 00:35:30.475\nWhereas a block,\nif I'm taking a chunk of data at one time,\n\n587\n00:35:30.475 --> 00:35:33.585\nI'm not gonna see that same pattern.\n\n588\n00:35:33.585 --> 00:35:37.540\nBut then the downside is, as you said,\nif I have data where it takes three and\n\n589\n00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:42.330\na half blocks of information,\nit's gotta pad that information, or\n\n590\n00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.170\nthat last block, with some known data.\n\n591\n00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.690\nIt has some kind of system\nto do this padding and\n\n592\n00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:51.000\nthen that's something that I\nmight be able to try to detect.\n\n593\n00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.630\nI might try to work on this algorithm\nby putting a one bit in there and\n\n594\n00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:59.320\nseeing what it pads the rest of it with,\nand start breaking that algorithm down.\n\n595\n00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.450\nSo, kinda, both sides have their\nissues that we have to deal with.\n\n596\n00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:07.730\nBoth of them have their places, I think,\nwhen it comes to the encryption.\n\n597\n00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:08.780\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n598\n00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:15.440\nThey both have little idiosyncrasies\nthat you should be aware of.\n\n599\n00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:22.140\nThere's something else\nabout streams that's\n\n600\n00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:26.522\nworth throwing a whole discussion,\nand that is, don't cross the streams.\n\n601\n00:36:26.522 --> 00:36:29.630\n>> [LAUGH] Never cross your streams.\n\n602\n00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.890\n>> Some of you were like going,\nwhere's he going with this?\n\n603\n00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:32.820\nHe's all serious.\n\n604\n00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.810\nSee how he did that?\n\n605\n00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.575\nIt's called acting people,\nit's called acting.\n\n606\n00:36:36.575 --> 00:36:37.950\n>> [LAUGH] Don't quit your day job.\n\n607\n00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.440\n>> Yeah, good enough.\n\n608\n00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.502\nA lot of them were like, write this down.\n\n609\n00:36:40.502 --> 00:36:41.150\nAll right, so, all right.\n\n610\n00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.280\n>> So, yeah, symmetry,\nwe've got block, we've got stream.\n\n611\n00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.000\nStream's typically a little\nbit faster as well, or\n\n612\n00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.390\nis it that blocks are a little bit faster,\nor is there much of a difference there?\n\n613\n00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:55.990\n>> In a lot of conditions, it can just\nbe a push, is the way that I put it.\n\n614\n00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:57.040\n>> Yeah.\n>> There is a difference,\n\n615\n00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.060\nbut what we haven't brought up, and\nwe're not gonna worry about here,\n\n616\n00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:07.180\nis that there's actually at least four\nmechanisms that you can use block in,\n\n617\n00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.360\nthat dictates how they're\ngonna move keys around.\n\n618\n00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.780\nAnd those things can make it faster or\nslower depending on how it's implemented.\n\n619\n00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:18.036\nSo there's-\n>> Six of one,\n\n620\n00:37:18.036 --> 00:37:19.920\nhalf dozen of another type thing.\n\n621\n00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.550\n>> Yeah, there could be some\ndifferences in there that say, okay,\n\n622\n00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:25.410\none performs better than the other.\n\n623\n00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:29.780\nAnd, heck, block ciphers,\nif you have one that's optimized for\n\n624\n00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.600\nthe memory on that system\nwith a larger block size,\n\n625\n00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.945\nthen it may perform a lot\nfaster than the stream would.\n\n626\n00:37:36.945 --> 00:37:39.420\n>> Cuz you're doing a block at a time,\n\n627\n00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.200\nyou can get through it\na little bit faster, maybe.\n\n628\n00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.460\n>> Yes.\n>> All right, let's talk about,\n\n629\n00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.470\nspeaking of some of\nthe different qualities,\n\n630\n00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:48.750\nlet's talk about some of the qualities\nof a symmetric encryption algorithm.\n\n631\n00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:53.850\n>> Yes, symmetric encryption\nalgorithms do have a lot of benefits.\n\n632\n00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.600\nThat's why they stayed in use for so long.\n\n633\n00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:01.170\nAnd they're even talking about it\nwith early computing systems they\n\n634\n00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:06.220\nwere popular because they\nhad certain benefits.\n\n635\n00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.400\n>> One of them is is that they're fast.\n\n636\n00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.170\nThey're just very, very fast.\n\n637\n00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:13.456\nAnd we're talking relative to asymmetric.\n\n638\n00:38:13.456 --> 00:38:16.498\n>> Right.\n>> They're very fast.\n\n639\n00:38:16.498 --> 00:38:18.950\nThey're simple.\n\n640\n00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:23.960\nI mean, any of the forms of\nsymmetric that we've looked at,\n\n641\n00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:30.460\nwhich all of them have been symmetric,\nevery last one of those is very simple.\n\n642\n00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:34.600\nEven though we look at the case like\nthe Vigenère cipher; it was tedious,\n\n643\n00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.910\nit is simple, nonetheless.\n\n644\n00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:41.670\nSo that's one of the big\nbenefits about it.\n\n645\n00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:46.740\nJust because it's simple, though,\ndoesn't mean it's gonna be easy to break.\n\n646\n00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.320\nWe also know that, too.\n\n647\n00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.140\nI mean, heck, I talked about in\nthe last segment about the Vigenere,\n\n648\n00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:59.730\nor the Great Cipher, sorry,\nhow that was a symmetric cipher.\n\n649\n00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:05.140\nThey lost the knowledge of how to\noperate it, and now it's like they have\n\n650\n00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.900\nmessages that, at least for some period of\ntime or something, they couldn't decrypt.\n\n651\n00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:10.530\n>> Right.\n\n652\n00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.968\n>> In fact, also, there's also\na footnote to that, by the way,\n\n653\n00:39:12.968 --> 00:39:15.000\nI didn't mention in the last segment.\n\n654\n00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.700\nSome of you may find this interesting.\n\n655\n00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:25.240\nThe Great Cipher, some of the stuff that\nwas encrypted with it, may actually hold\n\n656\n00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:31.581\nthe key to the person that was the story\nof The Man in the Iron Mask was based on.\n\n657\n00:39:31.581 --> 00:39:35.069\n>> Huh.\n>> Cuz they believe it was someone who\n\n658\n00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:39.390\nretreated from a battle and\nwho was a commander or general and\n\n659\n00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.860\nwas punished by putting this on.\n\n660\n00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.917\nAnd they think the actual evidence that\nlinks that together is in these documents,\n\n661\n00:39:45.917 --> 00:39:48.301\nbut they don't have access to them, so\n\n662\n00:39:48.301 --> 00:39:51.499\nit's kind of an interesting\nhistorical footnote.\n\n663\n00:39:51.499 --> 00:39:54.053\n>> We need to go volunteer for them so\nwe can brute force those things.\n\n664\n00:39:54.053 --> 00:39:55.597\n>> Yeah, that's what we need to do.\n\n665\n00:39:55.597 --> 00:39:58.197\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so Speed.\n\n666\n00:39:58.197 --> 00:40:03.403\nI like to think of them as lightweight\ncompared to asymmetric meaning they don't\n\n667\n00:40:03.403 --> 00:40:08.690\ntake nearly as much processing power,\nright, to perform these guys either.\n\n668\n00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:09.980\n>> Yeah, there's that work factor.\n\n669\n00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.540\nWe talked about in terminology yesterday.\n\n670\n00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:17.310\nThey have a much lower work factor when\nyou compare them as a group to asymmetric.\n\n671\n00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.550\nAsymmetric, much higher work factor.\n\n672\n00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:25.220\nTherefore you're gonna have to throw more\ncomputing power at it to make that happen.\n\n673\n00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:30.000\nSo that's a great thing that we have,\n\n674\n00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.950\nis that they're not really\nprocessor intensive.\n\n675\n00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:35.830\nFor the most part they're\nnot processor intensive.\n\n676\n00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.530\n>> One of the big reasons we prefer them\nsymmetric over asymmetric when we're\n\n677\n00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:44.250\ntalking about doing bulk amounts of data,\nlike when we're trying to encrypt a 400\n\n678\n00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:50.270\npage document or a large image or\nsomething like that.\n\n679\n00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.840\n>> Yeah, that's where we have\nbig problems, and that's\n\n680\n00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:58.550\nwhere the rubber hits the road, when\nyou're talking asymmetric and symmetric.\n\n681\n00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:04.920\nWhen you talk about symmetric,\nbulk data, so large volumes of data.\n\n682\n00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:10.070\nThe more data you throw at it,\nit's still going to operate at a very,\n\n683\n00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.120\nvery high speed without any problem.\n\n684\n00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.250\nThat's a great thing.\n\n685\n00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:19.590\nBecause we do transmit large\nvolumes of data all the time\n\n686\n00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:20.940\nthat need to be encrypted.\n\n687\n00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:25.590\nSo you definitely want to get the fastest\nmost bang for your buck you can.\n\n688\n00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:28.480\nSo symmetric does that for us.\n\n689\n00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.480\nBut there's drawbacks to it.\n\n690\n00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:37.644\nBut it does do bulk data very, very, very\nwell with little to no performance impact.\n\n691\n00:41:37.644 --> 00:41:38.864\n>> Right, that is impressive.\n\n692\n00:41:38.864 --> 00:41:43.824\nAnd if you think about it, if it's\na stream and it's only working one bit\n\n693\n00:41:43.824 --> 00:41:49.210\nat a time, if I've got 20 bits or\n2,000 bits or 2 million bits.\n\n694\n00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:50.660\nThe algorithm doesn't care, right?\n\n695\n00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:52.720\nIt's just processing one bit at a time.\n\n696\n00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.700\nWhich is how fast can I feed\nthem into that meat grinder?\n\n697\n00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.700\n>> Yep, exactly, that's it.\n\n698\n00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.550\n>> All right, and the you've got\nauthenticity listed here on the qualities.\n\n699\n00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:06.730\n>> Yes, so as we're going to see when\nwe go further into the components and\n\n700\n00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:10.020\nputting these things together,\nsymmetric is\n\n701\n00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:15.010\nalso really good at helping us perform\nauthenticity functions on information.\n\n702\n00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:18.760\nAnd we're going to see more of that but I\njust kind of want to throw that in at this\n\n703\n00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:24.320\nstage, that's something also that plays in\nthat symmetric is pretty good at doing.\n\n704\n00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:27.650\n>> All right, and\nyou mentioned some drawbacks.\n\n705\n00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.550\nThere are some drawbacks\nto symmetric encryption?\n\n706\n00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.180\n>> Yeah, symmetric has its problems.\n\n707\n00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:40.310\nSaid, there's no perfect solution for\nanything in this field.\n\n708\n00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:47.580\nWhen you talk about drawbacks, the number\none issue here is gonna be key management.\n\n709\n00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:52.170\nAnd we've already talked about that to\na certain degree is the problem with key\n\n710\n00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:57.250\nmanagement is gonna be that anybody\nyou wanna exchange data with.\n\n711\n00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:00.010\nYou have to give them a copy of your key,\nso\n\n712\n00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.200\nyou have to figure out how\nto get that key to them.\n\n713\n00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.950\nIf you're talking just three,\nfour, five people, it may not be\n\n714\n00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:10.420\nthat big of a problem, especially if you\nall happen to work in the same building.\n\n715\n00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:11.980\nYou can just say, okay, well,\n\n716\n00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.230\nwe're all on the same,\nwe're all in the same building every day.\n\n717\n00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.060\nWe're just gonna meet,\n\n718\n00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:20.230\ndo the secret handshake and\ntell what the code is for today.\n\n719\n00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.740\nAnd then go in our corners and\n\n720\n00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:24.620\nmake sure 8 o'clock tomorrow we're back\nin the same place to get the new one.\n\n721\n00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.580\n>> Yeah, I could hand you a thumb drive\nwith a key on it, or something like that.\n\n722\n00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.010\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> But that key distribution becomes\n\n723\n00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:30.350\na problem because if.\n\n724\n00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:33.500\nLet's say that I wanna send\nencrypted data over to Sean.\n\n725\n00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.950\nSo I'm gonna generate a key to use,\nI want a symmetric algorithm,\n\n726\n00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:40.040\nI'm gonna encrypt my data,\nI send that data over to Sean.\n\n727\n00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.615\nNow I have to get the key that I used\nto encrypt the data in the first place,\n\n728\n00:43:43.615 --> 00:43:45.725\nI've gotta somehow get that key to Sean.\n\n729\n00:43:45.725 --> 00:43:49.325\nAnd if Nate or\nRonnie intercepted that encrypted message,\n\n730\n00:43:49.325 --> 00:43:51.755\nnow they've got a copy\nof that encrypted data.\n\n731\n00:43:51.755 --> 00:43:55.897\nIf I send that key over to Sean,\nespecially if I'm using the same channel.\n\n732\n00:43:55.897 --> 00:43:58.987\nSean gets the key,\nhe can decrypt the information.\n\n733\n00:43:58.987 --> 00:44:02.477\nBut if Nate intercepts the key,\nhe's already intercepted the data so\n\n734\n00:44:02.477 --> 00:44:04.697\nthere's a good chance he's\ngonna intercept the key,\n\n735\n00:44:04.697 --> 00:44:06.667\nhe can now decrypt that data too, right?\n\n736\n00:44:06.667 --> 00:44:09.847\nAnybody that gets a hold of that\nkey can decrypt that information.\n\n737\n00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:14.327\nSo key distribution, big,\nbig problem with symmetric algorithms.\n\n738\n00:44:14.327 --> 00:44:17.760\n>> Yeah.\nBig, big, big problem with it.\n\n739\n00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:23.410\nSo when I see that Ben's got descriptions\nof symmetric and asymmetric up there.\n\n740\n00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:26.060\n>> It's not Bob and Alice up there guys,\nget with the times.\n\n741\n00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.150\nIt's Link and Zelda.\n\n742\n00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:28.300\n>> Yeah, it's Link and Zelda.\n\n743\n00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.420\nRead the book.\n>> Oh, come on.\n\n744\n00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.950\n[LAUGH] No, good job Ben.\n\n745\n00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:34.230\n>> You know, when you read that,\n\n746\n00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:38.490\nif you read that first part of that first\nthing Ben put up there the right way.\n\n747\n00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.485\nI mean, Alice first puts\nthe secret message in a box.\n\n748\n00:44:41.485 --> 00:44:46.130\n[LAUGH] It sounds like that,\nwhat's that one, Silence of the Lambs,\n\n749\n00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:50.398\nit puts the lotion on its skin,\n[LAUGH] or it gets the hose again.\n\n750\n00:44:50.398 --> 00:44:51.980\n>> [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n751\n00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.690\n>> Put it in the basket.\n\n752\n00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:54.360\nAll right.\n\n753\n00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.620\n>> And then you got his formula listed\nhere, let's talk about that for a second.\n\n754\n00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:05.100\n>> Yes, so the formula I've, here, before\nI talk about it, is a very simple one.\n\n755\n00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:09.040\nBut, what the formula refers to is.\n\n756\n00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:15.760\nWhat about if you have the situation where\nyou need to prove the identity of someone?\n\n757\n00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.100\nSo you want to introduce that\nnonrepudiation function.\n\n758\n00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.110\nThe way you do that\nnonrepudiation function is,\n\n759\n00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:25.630\neveryone has to have their own unique key.\n\n760\n00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:29.880\nSo if everyone has to have their\nown unique key, what do you do?\n\n761\n00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:34.840\nYou generate one for them, and\nof course, then the next thing comes up,\n\n762\n00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:39.020\nis if I need to open up stuff from you,\nI need to have your key now.\n\n763\n00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:42.380\nSo okay, you've got that, and\nnow you're gonna take it.\n\n764\n00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.550\nYou know what?\n\n765\n00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:46.250\nScout's honor no one's gonna\nuse anyone else's key.\n\n766\n00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:50.850\nWe'll say that everyone is\ngonna abide by that rule and\n\n767\n00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:53.260\nwe trust everyone to abide by that rule,\nokay.\n\n768\n00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.730\nWell, with that out of the picture,\n\n769\n00:45:55.880 --> 00:46:00.060\nlet's think about what that means as\nfar as keys you've got to distribute.\n\n770\n00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:05.250\nBecause if it's just Mike and\nI, I give him a copy of mine.\n\n771\n00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:07.310\nHe gives me a copy of his and we're done.\n\n772\n00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.510\nNot that big of a deal.\n\n773\n00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:12.600\nBut once you start introducing\nyou know 10, 20, 50,\n\n774\n00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:17.120\na 100 people into a system like that and\nkeeping going up.\n\n775\n00:46:18.195 --> 00:46:20.375\nThe number of keys that\nyou have to generate and\n\n776\n00:46:20.375 --> 00:46:25.545\ndistribute ahead of time becomes\njust big pretty quickly.\n\n777\n00:46:25.545 --> 00:46:28.555\n>> If we pull up my screen, I think\nwe can show that formula real quick,\n\n778\n00:46:28.555 --> 00:46:31.440\nthat Sean's got here, and\nof course it's in his book as well.\n\n779\n00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:37.460\nBut it's basically n times n minus\n1 divided by 2 and let me make\n\n780\n00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:42.990\nthat a little bit bigger here, equals the\nnumber of keys that we're going to need.\n\n781\n00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:48.270\n>> Yeah so what you would have there\nto carry this out, you would have.\n\n782\n00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:53.780\nYou take the number of people\nthat are going to participate\n\n783\n00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.650\nin your specific group.\n\n784\n00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.540\nAnd what you would do is\nyou plug that in for N.\n\n785\n00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.220\nSo if you had ten people.\n\n786\n00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.500\n>> Let's say we got two, I'll do two for\nit's like you and I here.\n\n787\n00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.247\nSo I've got 2(2-1)/2.\n\n788\n00:47:08.247 --> 00:47:09.453\n>> And you get an error.\n\n789\n00:47:09.453 --> 00:47:10.093\n>> It doesn't like my formula.\n\n790\n00:47:10.093 --> 00:47:11.010\n>> See.\n\n791\n00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:12.091\nThat's the problem.\n\n792\n00:47:12.091 --> 00:47:13.220\n>> What is wrong with that?\n\n793\n00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.810\nI'm not sure.\n\n794\n00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:17.055\nLet's accept it.\n\n795\n00:47:17.055 --> 00:47:17.715\n>> I get.\n\n796\n00:47:17.715 --> 00:47:20.501\n>> I don't think you did that right.\n\n797\n00:47:20.501 --> 00:47:25.856\n2(2-1)/2 equals the number of keys,\nso we'd need one key.\n\n798\n00:47:25.856 --> 00:47:26.866\nIs that right?\n>> That sounds about right.\n\n799\n00:47:26.866 --> 00:47:27.372\n>> Let's try if we need ten people.\n\n800\n00:47:27.372 --> 00:47:30.570\nSo that equals\n\n801\n00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:38.832\n10*(10-1) divided by 2.\n\n802\n00:47:40.491 --> 00:47:41.710\nI don't know what it doesn't like about.\n\n803\n00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:44.400\nOh, I didn't put that\ndivision sign in there.\n\n804\n00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.730\nOops.\n\n805\n00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:47.745\nYeah.\nThat's just my typing skills here.\n\n806\n00:47:47.745 --> 00:47:49.330\n>> [LAUGH] It happens.\n\n807\n00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:50.990\n>> I will say divided by 2.\n\n808\n00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:52.372\nThere we go.\n\n809\n00:47:52.372 --> 00:47:56.715\nAnd all of a sudden we bump up ten people,\nand we're up to 45 keys.\n\n810\n00:47:56.715 --> 00:47:57.398\n>> Yeah.\n\n811\n00:47:57.398 --> 00:47:59.953\nAnd ten people's not a large office,\nright?\n\n812\n00:47:59.953 --> 00:48:01.078\n>> Yeah, that's not.\n\n813\n00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:06.025\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> 45 different keys you've gotta have and\n\n814\n00:48:06.025 --> 00:48:09.490\ndistribute to prove this whole thing.\n\n815\n00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:10.348\nThat's a mess.\n\n816\n00:48:10.348 --> 00:48:14.838\n>> Let's just say an average\nof say 100 people there.\n\n817\n00:48:14.838 --> 00:48:21.248\nThey got 100 times and\nwe'll multiply that by 100 minus 1,\n\n818\n00:48:21.248 --> 00:48:25.369\nand then we'll end up dividing that by 2,\n\n819\n00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:29.954\nand that's a lot of keys to manage or\nmaintain.\n\n820\n00:48:29.954 --> 00:48:34.873\n>> Yeah, it's a real mess of all\nthe operations you're gonna have\n\n821\n00:48:34.873 --> 00:48:37.070\nto carry to get that to work.\n\n822\n00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:44.560\nAnd so that's the big, big problem with\nsymmetric, is that key management.\n\n823\n00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.700\nIf you want to do nonrepudiation with it.\n\n824\n00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:52.570\n>> Yeah, cuz really the keys aren't\ntied to an individual in this case.\n\n825\n00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:56.180\nSo it's really hard to prove\nthe originator of that data.\n\n826\n00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:00.180\nI might, if I got hold of Sean's key or\nsomebody else's key and\n\n827\n00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:01.050\nencrypted something.\n\n828\n00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:07.250\nYou just can't tie it back to\nan individual or some type of identity.\n\n829\n00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:09.420\nSo we don't get that nonrepudiation.\n\n830\n00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:13.650\nAnd that's not gonna be, something we\ntypically want is that nonrepudiation, or\n\n831\n00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.240\nwe would like to get out of that.\n\n832\n00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.250\n>> Yeah, if that was part\nof the goal of your system,\n\n833\n00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:21.220\nsymmetric isn't gonna do\nwithout a whole lot of effort.\n\n834\n00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.200\nIt's just not designed for that situation.\n\n835\n00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.970\nSo we've got a big, big,\nbig, big problem with that.\n\n836\n00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:31.850\nSo that was one of the things\nthat over the years,\n\n837\n00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:37.080\nif you look at where symmetric was being\nused over all this time, we never really\n\n838\n00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:41.570\nmentioned in any of those situations that\nhey, well it was tied back to this person.\n\n839\n00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:45.922\nIt was tied back to that person because\nwhen they decrypted it they found evidence\n\n840\n00:49:45.922 --> 00:49:49.511\nin the decrypted the plain text,\nthat tied it back to that person.\n\n841\n00:49:49.511 --> 00:49:54.843\nLike the Mary, Queen of Scots\nthing we talked about in history,\n\n842\n00:49:54.843 --> 00:49:59.780\nthey knew it was her doing it\nbecause they had her stuff right\n\n843\n00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:03.850\nthere on the message\nindicating that she did it.\n\n844\n00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:07.860\nSo it wasn't the actual\nencrypting system that did it.\n\n845\n00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.800\nIt was the message itself.\n\n846\n00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:16.560\nIt's only later with the birth of\nasymmetric that we saw nonrepudiation and\n\n847\n00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:22.870\nkey management start to get addressed in a\npractical, repeatable, and simple manner.\n\n848\n00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:26.340\n>> Well looking at the clock it's about\ntime for us to take a quick break.\n\n849\n00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.302\nSo we're gonna step away.\n\n850\n00:50:27.302 --> 00:50:30.560\nWhen we come back more on algorithms and\nciphers.\n\n851\n00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.710\nSo stay tuned.\n\n852\n00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:32.777\nWe'll be right back.\n\n853\n00:50:32.777 --> 00:50:35.617\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n854\n00:50:35.617 --> 00:50:41.790\nwelcome back ladies and gentleman.\n\n855\n00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:44.110\nTo continue on with our algorithms and\nciphers,\n\n856\n00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:47.470\nwe've been discussing our\nsymmetric encryption algorithms.\n\n857\n00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:51.540\nTalking about some of the properties\nof what makes a symmetric algorithm.\n\n858\n00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:55.148\nAs well as some of the strengths\nof the symmetric algorithms, and\n\n859\n00:50:55.148 --> 00:50:59.159\nthe weakness of the symmetric algorithms,\nif I can say that four times.\n\n860\n00:50:59.159 --> 00:51:01.664\nAnd then the next thing we want to\ntalk about is just some of the ties.\n\n861\n00:51:01.664 --> 00:51:05.856\nCuz we really need to be familiar with\nwhich ones of these myriad encryption\n\n862\n00:51:05.856 --> 00:51:10.960\nitems we have available, actually\nare symmetric encryption algorithms.\n\n863\n00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:15.736\n>> Yes, as we were saying in\na previous segment, there's so\n\n864\n00:51:15.736 --> 00:51:18.079\nmany algorithms out there.\n\n865\n00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:22.784\nThe ones that are just being\ncited here are just some of\n\n866\n00:51:22.784 --> 00:51:25.935\nthe ones that you may have heard of.\n\n867\n00:51:25.935 --> 00:51:27.900\nI'm saying that, you have heard of them.\n\n868\n00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:30.910\n>> Probably seen a lot of\nthese in real world use, yeah.\n\n869\n00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:33.580\n>> Yeah, you have seen them out\nthere at some way shape or form.\n\n870\n00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:37.960\nSome of them are just of interest,\nyou know out there and.\n\n871\n00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.223\n>> All of these are mentioned,\n\n872\n00:51:39.223 --> 00:51:41.706\nand at least Security+ even,\ngoes over a lot of these.\n\n873\n00:51:41.706 --> 00:51:43.047\n>> Yeah, there's another plug right there.\n\n874\n00:51:43.047 --> 00:51:44.259\n>> There you go, future episodes.\n\n875\n00:51:44.259 --> 00:51:47.137\n>> [LAUGH] You've been following along,\nright?\n\n876\n00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:51.187\n>> [LAUGH] So let us go through some\nof them the first one you got here on\n\n877\n00:51:51.187 --> 00:51:55.987\nthe list a good old DES, data encryption\nstandard, and that's one that has\n\n878\n00:51:55.987 --> 00:52:01.240\nbeen around for a while and for a long\ntime, the US government relied on it.\n\n879\n00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.950\n>> Yes, it was used by the US\ngovernment for a long time.\n\n880\n00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:10.970\nWas developed in the late 70s and\nwas used for quite a long time.\n\n881\n00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:14.850\nWas never really approved for\nthe top secret sensitive type things.\n\n882\n00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:17.370\nIt was for stuff less than that.\n\n883\n00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:19.140\n>> Inter office communications and\nstuff like that.\n\n884\n00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.930\n>> Yeah, it was approved for\nthose sorts of things.\n\n885\n00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:26.864\nThere was stuff they used differently for\nTS, SCI type stuff, things of that level.\n\n886\n00:52:26.864 --> 00:52:29.590\nSo that were much stronger than this.\n\n887\n00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:37.070\nBut still, this did get widely used,\nstill is widely used.\n\n888\n00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:40.000\nIt's just a question of where you use it.\n\n889\n00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.910\nGovernment doesn't use it anymore for\n\n890\n00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:45.990\nany of their major things at\nall because it's been broken.\n\n891\n00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:50.760\nIt's been shown that there you\ncan brute force this thing so\n\n892\n00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:55.300\neasily with the technology that\nwe have nowadays that it's just\n\n893\n00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.500\nsomeone with a little bit\nof effort can break it.\n\n894\n00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:00.660\nSo what they had to do is they\nmoved into something else,\n\n895\n00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:04.055\nwhich we'll talk about that so-\n>> Override it was what like,\n\n896\n00:53:04.055 --> 00:53:05.560\n56 bits on the key, or\nsomething like that?\n\n897\n00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.557\n>> It was 56 bit, yeah.\n\n898\n00:53:07.557 --> 00:53:10.240\n>> Yeah,\npretty small key space to start with.\n\n899\n00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.740\n>> Yeah, and then it just kind\nof went downhill from there.\n\n900\n00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:17.040\nThere's other things inside of it,\neven make that key space even smaller.\n\n901\n00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.867\nBut at the time it was developed,\ninterestingly enough,\n\n902\n00:53:19.867 --> 00:53:21.781\nthe time it was developed in the 70s.\n\n903\n00:53:21.781 --> 00:53:26.391\nThey kind of projected based on the way\ncomputing power was progressing and\n\n904\n00:53:26.391 --> 00:53:29.255\na few other factors they said,\nyou know what?\n\n905\n00:53:29.255 --> 00:53:33.472\nThis is probably gonna be usable for\nmaybe a decade,\n\n906\n00:53:33.472 --> 00:53:37.952\nmaybe 15 years or so, but\nnot much longer than that.\n\n907\n00:53:37.952 --> 00:53:38.921\nAnd sure enough,\n\n908\n00:53:38.921 --> 00:53:42.808\nthey hit it right around the early\n90s was when this thing was broken.\n\n909\n00:53:42.808 --> 00:53:47.419\nIf memory serves, they were within\nabout a year of guessing correctly,\n\n910\n00:53:47.419 --> 00:53:52.198\nwhich is amazing when you think about it,\nto do the prediction that close.\n\n911\n00:53:52.198 --> 00:53:56.660\nAnybody that says oh,\nwell, you were a year off.\n\n912\n00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:58.362\n>> Yeah, well, you try it,\nlet's see how well you do.\n\n913\n00:53:58.362 --> 00:53:59.310\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n914\n00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:03.510\ntry to figure out what processing\npower's gonna be like with computers.\n\n915\n00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:05.790\nAnd computers were relatively\nnew at that point.\n\n916\n00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:08.230\nAnd so yeah, pretty impressive stuff.\n\n917\n00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:12.329\nBut, and as you say, it's not that\nit's a soup well by today's standards,\n\n918\n00:54:12.329 --> 00:54:12.970\nit is weak.\n\n919\n00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:15.133\nBut at the time, it was perfect.\n\n920\n00:54:15.133 --> 00:54:19.596\nIt did what it was supposed to do,\n56 bits was a lot of bits back then.\n\n921\n00:54:19.596 --> 00:54:20.116\n>> Yeah.\n\n922\n00:54:20.116 --> 00:54:20.905\n>> It's project key space.\n\n923\n00:54:20.905 --> 00:54:21.860\n>> Yeah, it worked.\n\n924\n00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:26.739\nThe computing power you had around that\ntime that this thing got developed.\n\n925\n00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.943\nWe're talking late 70s,\nso we don't have PCs yet.\n\n926\n00:54:30.943 --> 00:54:31.919\n>> Right.\n\n927\n00:54:31.919 --> 00:54:36.681\n>> At least not wide spread, some people\ncould argue that there were personal\n\n928\n00:54:36.681 --> 00:54:41.980\nthings but those are just unique one\noff solutions that were out there.\n\n929\n00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:44.420\nSo people that had computers\nwere government and\n\n930\n00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:47.590\neducational institutions and\nresearch facilities.\n\n931\n00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:53.860\nAnd those were those big things and\nthey would still take awhile to do this.\n\n932\n00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:57.743\nIt wasn't till computing power started\nramping up more and more and more.\n\n933\n00:54:57.743 --> 00:55:02.805\nAnd then when the early 90s, someone\nfigured out how to kind of daisy chain\n\n934\n00:55:02.805 --> 00:55:08.024\na bunch of these together that they were\nable to say, okay well, putting these\n\n935\n00:55:08.024 --> 00:55:13.033\ntogether and doing all this good stuff\nto it would actually get us a result.\n\n936\n00:55:13.033 --> 00:55:18.600\nSo they did that in the early 90s,\nlike 92 or 93 I wanna say.\n\n937\n00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:24.133\nAnd nowadays the horsepower to do\nit is available a lot more readily.\n\n938\n00:55:24.133 --> 00:55:31.680\nYou can get that at a lot of different\nplaces without too much effort whatsoever.\n\n939\n00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:36.480\nSo that leads to the fact\nthat they will not use this\n\n940\n00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.670\nin any serious sensitive environment.\n\n941\n00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:40.990\nLike I joke around.\n\n942\n00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:43.176\nYou wanna protect your mom's\ncookie recipe with this-\n\n943\n00:55:43.176 --> 00:55:43.896\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n944\n00:55:43.896 --> 00:55:44.685\n>> Have at.\n\n945\n00:55:44.685 --> 00:55:45.428\n>> Right.\n\n946\n00:55:45.428 --> 00:55:48.200\n>> And I'm pretty sure no\none's gonna go looking for\n\n947\n00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:51.699\nit unless you happen to live next to Mrs.\nFields or something.\n\n948\n00:55:51.699 --> 00:55:52.805\n>> Right, or Otis Spunkmeyer, maybe.\n\n949\n00:55:52.805 --> 00:55:55.196\n>> Yeah, or Otis lives next to you,\nor something.\n\n950\n00:55:55.196 --> 00:55:58.284\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nthis was good in a time.\n\n951\n00:55:58.284 --> 00:56:02.827\nIt went through its life cycle and\nit reached the end of its life cycle,\n\n952\n00:56:02.827 --> 00:56:06.080\nits predicted life cycle,\nand it was replaced.\n\n953\n00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:10.800\nThey took this and\ndid something to it to extend it out or\n\n954\n00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.000\nmorph it into something that is used now.\n\n955\n00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:14.960\n>> Yes.\n\n956\n00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:20.253\nTo kind of frame this\nwhole discussion here,\n\n957\n00:56:20.253 --> 00:56:23.468\nabout what succeeded Des.\n\n958\n00:56:23.468 --> 00:56:27.203\nWhat you should be aware of is\nthe fact that the government,\n\n959\n00:56:27.203 --> 00:56:31.087\nwhen they realized Des was coming\nto the end of its lifetime and\n\n960\n00:56:31.087 --> 00:56:34.169\nthey needed to find a viable\nreplacement for it.\n\n961\n00:56:34.169 --> 00:56:38.970\nThey started up something that\nthey still do now and then.\n\n962\n00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:43.040\nThey started up this competition called\nthe advanced encryption standard\n\n963\n00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.330\ncompetition.\n\n964\n00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:47.800\nAnd there were a lot of\nentries into this field.\n\n965\n00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:51.520\nIt was a pretty big field, and\nthere were some names in there.\n\n966\n00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:57.770\nAlgorithms and\npeople that you may already be aware of.\n\n967\n00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:03.310\nI mean, there was encryption\nalgorithms like, blowfish was in there.\n\n968\n00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:06.500\n>> Was that when they did triple des,\nor when they did AES.\n\n969\n00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:10.470\n>> Triple des was actually a part of\nthis competition, it was entered in.\n\n970\n00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:14.974\nAnd there is,\nyou had triple des entered in.\n\n971\n00:57:14.974 --> 00:57:16.902\nYou had-\n>> Two fish, blowfish.\n\n972\n00:57:16.902 --> 00:57:18.342\n>> Two fish blowfish.\n\n973\n00:57:18.342 --> 00:57:20.224\n>> The whole Doctor Seuss\nthing was in there.\n\n974\n00:57:20.224 --> 00:57:21.802\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n975\n00:57:21.802 --> 00:57:25.665\n>> And these were big guys, big players,\nthe Reindell had one in there.\n\n976\n00:57:25.665 --> 00:57:27.680\n>> Yeah.\n>> I think Rivitz had one in there as\n\n977\n00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:28.402\nwell maybe.\n\n978\n00:57:28.402 --> 00:57:30.960\n>> Yeah there was a bunch of them,\nyeah and so.\n\n979\n00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.610\nThey went through and\nhad this competition and\n\n980\n00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:37.490\nall these things were\nevaluated by the NSA.\n\n981\n00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:40.880\nAnd they went through all these rounds\nof competition, over and over again.\n\n982\n00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.800\nTrying different things.\n\n983\n00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.040\nDifferent tests and different analysis.\n\n984\n00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.380\nCode breaking.\n\n985\n00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:49.180\nWhere they went through all of that and\neventually at the end of it,\n\n986\n00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:57.660\nthe one they chose, to that one was the\nRijndael Cipher or the Rijndael Algorithm.\n\n987\n00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:00.600\nThat one won the competition.\n\n988\n00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:05.670\nAnd it actually took the name\nof the competition as its name.\n\n989\n00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:10.010\nSo, Rijndael was formally\nrebranded as AES,\n\n990\n00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:13.690\nAdvanced Encryption Standard\nfrom the contest it grew out of.\n\n991\n00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:17.150\nSo, we see AES being used a lot.\n\n992\n00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:21.870\nIt's substantially more powerful\nthan other things out there.\n\n993\n00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:27.682\nNow, in the case of its other entrant,\nyour triple des.\n\n994\n00:58:27.682 --> 00:58:31.720\nTriple des was one that\nwas entered as well.\n\n995\n00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:36.450\nIt didn't get the same kind of\n\n996\n00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:41.470\nsign off that AES did but\nit's still widely used.\n\n997\n00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:46.010\nYou guys see it all the time,\nthere's no doubt about that.\n\n998\n00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:50.910\nWhat triple Des is, is they took\nthe original Des algorithm and\n\n999\n00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:54.330\nthey initially said, well, it's weak.\n\n1000\n00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:56.830\nLet's double the key length on it.\n\n1001\n00:58:56.830 --> 00:59:02.510\nSo they doubled the key length and\ndid some other magic behind the scenes and\n\n1002\n00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:06.520\nthey came up with that 112 bit key and\nthis other stuff.\n\n1003\n00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:12.350\nAnd turned out that it didn't really offer\nany substantial increase in power and\n\n1004\n00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:13.350\nsecurity.\n\n1005\n00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:16.110\nOver it's 56 bit predecessor.\n\n1006\n00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:21.720\nSo, they put 1 more round on it, and\nincreased the key out to 168 bits.\n\n1007\n00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:24.750\nAnd did some other stuff inside of it,\nto combine it and do it.\n\n1008\n00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:28.320\nAnd they found that there's this\nbig bump up, and it shrank,\n\n1009\n00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:32.740\nso they went ahead and\nsaid, okay, this one works.\n\n1010\n00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:35.470\nSo they, they, that one got entered.\n\n1011\n00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:36.400\nIt didn't win.\n\n1012\n00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:40.470\nBut I don't know if it was a runner-up or\nsomething but\n\n1013\n00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:43.560\nit did get in that competition and\ndid make it all the way through.\n\n1014\n00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:47.630\nAES Is of course, or\nRinedall, that became AES,\n\n1015\n00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:52.190\nis the formal champion\nof that competition.\n\n1016\n00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:54.010\nSo kind of an interesting\nlittle thing that they did.\n\n1017\n00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:55.590\n>> That is, it's pretty neat.\n\n1018\n00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:58.100\nAnd I love the names they come up with for\nall, Skip Jacket.\n\n1019\n00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:59.364\nI think was another one\nthat I remember now.\n\n1020\n00:59:59.364 --> 01:00:02.424\nBlue fish, two fish, skip jack,\nall the names are great for\n\n1021\n01:00:02.424 --> 01:00:04.053\nthese encryption algorithms.\n\n1022\n01:00:04.053 --> 01:00:06.813\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah you wonder where they get them\n\n1023\n01:00:06.813 --> 01:00:07.377\nfrom.\n\n1024\n01:00:07.377 --> 01:00:09.582\nI've seen some weird ones too.\n\n1025\n01:00:09.582 --> 01:00:13.915\nYou're like, what?\n\n1026\n01:00:13.915 --> 01:00:16.520\nWhat now?\nI saw one called a cat mouse one time.\n\n1027\n01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1028\n01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.525\nThey have one called that.\n\n1029\n01:00:18.525 --> 01:00:23.010\nThere's one with some Egyptian themes\nin it, like Ra or something like that.\n\n1030\n01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:26.360\nYou know, so you just really wonder.\n\n1031\n01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.330\nMy favorite one that they had\nthat I heard was, over the years,\n\n1032\n01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.190\nwas one called Knapsack.\n\n1033\n01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.800\n>> Knapsack.\n\n1034\n01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.300\nNice.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1035\n01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.030\nThey called it that.\n\n1036\n01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:35.570\nIt was called Knapsack because it was this\n\n1037\n01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:38.540\nalgorithm why it was found to be flawed.\n\n1038\n01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:42.990\nThe whole algorithm was based around\na puzzle that someone came up with in\n\n1039\n01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.930\ntheir head.\n\n1040\n01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:47.190\nSaying well, you can choose keys and\n\n1041\n01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:52.420\nthe way encryption is gonna be done by\nbasing it on a puzzle that is where\n\n1042\n01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:58.250\nyou literally have a knapsack\nthat carries a certain capacity.\n\n1043\n01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:01.590\nAnd then you've got a bunch of items\nout there of different sizes and\n\n1044\n01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:06.640\nshapes, and then you can put them\nin all different combinations.\n\n1045\n01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.570\nYeah, and so, that's what the guy\nbased it off of, you know,\n\n1046\n01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:13.840\npacking a bag, packing a knapsack.\n\n1047\n01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.090\nAnd he went through and did some more\nstuff on it to make it mathematical and\n\n1048\n01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:21.960\nall this other stuff, and he said hey,\nwe're going to call it Knapsack.\n\n1049\n01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.730\n>> Nice.\n>> All right, you want to call it that.\n\n1050\n01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:26.740\n>> Whatever works,\nhe came up with something.\n\n1051\n01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:29.720\n>> It's original,\nI guess you can say that.\n\n1052\n01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.010\n>> So we got, we got Des, we got our\ndata encryption, and we got triple Des,\n\n1053\n01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:35.900\nwhich basically was three\nrounds of Des encrypted.\n\n1054\n01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.840\nGenerated key encrypted,\ngenerated another key, encrypted again.\n\n1055\n01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.560\nGenerate another key,\nencrypted a third time.\n\n1056\n01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.130\nWe got AES, which is originally Rijndael,\n\n1057\n01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:49.220\nif I say his name correctly, became\nthe new standard for the US government.\n\n1058\n01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:54.050\nBecause it won that contest and it was\nrenamed the Advanced Encryption Standard.\n\n1059\n01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:57.520\nThen I got one Sean that I'm\nnot familiar with, MARS?\n\n1060\n01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.590\nYeah, Mars is another one.\n\n1061\n01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:02.090\nI just kinda threw it in here,\nshow you kind of another interesting one.\n\n1062\n01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:06.950\nThis was developed as kind of\nan educational type thing being done.\n\n1063\n01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:10.720\nAnd it's used in some proprietary products\nand some colleges and stuff like that,\n\n1064\n01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.790\nbut it's another.\n\n1065\n01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:12.740\nSymmetric one.\n\n1066\n01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.600\nI think this one has 128 bit key on it.\n\n1067\n01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.260\nBut it's out there in the wild.\n\n1068\n01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:24.870\nBut that's kind of a more obscure one,\njust thought I'd throw one in there and\n\n1069\n01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:26.800\nbe like, well, it's not just these guys.\n\n1070\n01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.040\nIt's the usual suspects.\n\n1071\n01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.210\nThere's other ones in this field.\n\n1072\n01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:35.700\nAnd that's definitely one of these cases,\nit's another one out there being used.\n\n1073\n01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:39.637\n>> Right, and then we've got one\nthat I know we're familiar with,\n\n1074\n01:02:39.637 --> 01:02:41.081\nwhich is good old RC4.\n\n1075\n01:02:41.081 --> 01:02:47.010\n>> Yes, RC4 is another one that's,\nit's seen a lot of us,\n\n1076\n01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:53.579\nand in fact, it's seen a,\nit's seen a use in a notorious area.\n\n1077\n01:02:53.579 --> 01:02:55.310\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, unfortunately.\n\n1078\n01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:56.600\n>> In WEP.\n\n1079\n01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:01.530\nWEP was the big user,\nthat most people are familiar with,\n\n1080\n01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:05.695\nthat uses RC4 and\nyou know the story there.\n\n1081\n01:03:05.695 --> 01:03:06.855\nYou've been down that road.\n\n1082\n01:03:06.855 --> 01:03:08.735\n>> We don't have to rehash that.\n\n1083\n01:03:08.735 --> 01:03:10.175\nBut, and it really wasn't Rufus.\n\n1084\n01:03:10.175 --> 01:03:12.125\nI mean, the cipher was good,\nit was the implementation,\n\n1085\n01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:13.905\nwhich we've talked about a few times,\nright?\n\n1086\n01:03:13.905 --> 01:03:16.948\nThe implementation of the cipher,\nit wasn't done well.\n\n1087\n01:03:16.948 --> 01:03:23.760\n>> Yeah, that's a subject, a recurring\ntheme, that we've mentioned here.\n\n1088\n01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.790\nIs that,\nif you don't know how to use cryptography,\n\n1089\n01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:30.530\nit's really not useful to\nyou in the way it should be,\n\n1090\n01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:33.070\nif you're going to implement\nit into a software product.\n\n1091\n01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:37.060\nIf you're just an end user you're trusting\nthe person that put that together\n\n1092\n01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.800\nthat they know what they're doing.\n\n1093\n01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:45.328\nAnd so if they don't, you've definitely\ngot a big, big, big, big problem.\n\n1094\n01:03:45.328 --> 01:03:50.954\nSo that's why when you're evaluating\nsoftware you always wanna have\n\n1095\n01:03:50.954 --> 01:03:57.148\nsomething that says, it uses a known\nencryption standard that you can go to,\n\n1096\n01:03:57.148 --> 01:04:01.459\nlook at that encryption standard and\ngo to a website.\n\n1097\n01:04:01.459 --> 01:04:04.049\nOr where ever and\nget direct information of that,\n\n1098\n01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:09.020\nit's not something that's proprietary and\nit's behind the scenes or something.\n\n1099\n01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:13.720\nThat isn't gonna help you but who knows,\nit could be a good algorithm.\n\n1100\n01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:18.010\nI just don't feel comfortable\ntrusting that because it's not open,\n\n1101\n01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:20.995\nI can't look at it and I don't know\nwho the heck that is that did it.\n\n1102\n01:04:20.995 --> 01:04:22.510\n>> Mm-Hm.\n\n1103\n01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:24.350\nAnd then we got IKEA.\n\n1104\n01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:27.240\nI mean IDEA.\n\n1105\n01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.157\nNot the furniture store.\n\n1106\n01:04:28.157 --> 01:04:29.099\nWe're not talking about\nthe furniture store here.\n\n1107\n01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:30.150\n>> Yeah.\n\n1108\n01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:31.220\nDefinitely not that.\n\n1109\n01:04:32.948 --> 01:04:36.090\nBut yeah, IDEA was the International\nData Encryption standard,\n\n1110\n01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:37.140\nif I remember correctly.\n\n1111\n01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:42.700\n>> Yeah, that's another one that's out and\nbeen used for quite awhile.\n\n1112\n01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:47.280\nThis one pops its head up in PGP,\npretty good privacy,\n\n1113\n01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.180\nsomething that we're gonna see\nmuch further down the road.\n\n1114\n01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.580\nBut that's where that shows up and\ndoes its work a lot.\n\n1115\n01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.820\nYou don't see it a ton outside of that.\n\n1116\n01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:02.110\nIt is used outside of that, but that's\nprobably the biggest place you're most\n\n1117\n01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:06.620\nlikely to run into it,\nis gonna be in that situation.\n\n1118\n01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:10.780\nSo that's the deal with that one.\n\n1119\n01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:12.160\n>> Okay.\n\n1120\n01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:15.120\nAnd then we've got the last one we've\ngot on our list here is the Rijndael,\n\n1121\n01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.280\nwhich ended up becoming our AES.\n\n1122\n01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:18.925\n>> Yeah.\n\n1123\n01:05:18.925 --> 01:05:23.950\nRijndael is actually a combinations\nof a couple people's names that are-\n\n1124\n01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:25.270\n>> Rindol, Shamir,\n\n1125\n01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:27.815\ngosh if I could remember that, Adleman?\n\n1126\n01:05:27.815 --> 01:05:30.711\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh, you're thinking RSA.\n\n1127\n01:05:30.711 --> 01:05:31.861\n>> Oh, I'm thinking RSA.\n\n1128\n01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:33.696\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1129\n01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:36.030\nthere's too many names\nfloating around here, so yeah.\n\n1130\n01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:40.447\n[LAUGH] But\nthis is an amalgamation of the guys that.\n\n1131\n01:05:40.447 --> 01:05:41.473\n>> Joan Daemen.\n\n1132\n01:05:41.473 --> 01:05:42.580\n>> Is that who it is?\n\n1133\n01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:46.010\n>> Yes, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.\n\n1134\n01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.615\n>> There you go.\n\n1135\n01:05:46.615 --> 01:05:48.660\n>> [INAUDIBLE] pronouncing those\ncorrectly, if not I apologize.\n\n1136\n01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:50.380\nSo.\n\n1137\n01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.490\n>> So, yeah.\n\n1138\n01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:56.120\nBut it was an amalgamation\nof their two names.\n\n1139\n01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:59.293\nIt went into that AES competition,\n\n1140\n01:05:59.293 --> 01:06:03.433\nof course won it, and\nit was rebranded as AES.\n\n1141\n01:06:03.433 --> 01:06:08.211\nOkay, now, I think it's fair for\nme to throw this in there,\n\n1142\n01:06:08.211 --> 01:06:12.147\ntoo, is that there is some\ndiscussion that AES and\n\n1143\n01:06:12.147 --> 01:06:15.545\nRijndael aren't exactly the same thing.\n\n1144\n01:06:15.545 --> 01:06:18.332\nThat they're on the surface and\nwhat we know,\n\n1145\n01:06:18.332 --> 01:06:21.190\nwhat we've been told they're the same.\n\n1146\n01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:26.900\nBut there's been discussion over the years\nthat maybe when it went in to get\n\n1147\n01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:31.980\nevaluated and get adjusted, that maybe,\nand I'm not trying to be tin foil hat here\n\n1148\n01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:37.220\nor anything, that maybe the NSA\nhelped contribute some stuff to it.\n\n1149\n01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:39.560\n>> Don't say they put\na backdoor in our algorithm.\n\n1150\n01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:40.387\n>> I'm not saying that.\n\n1151\n01:06:40.387 --> 01:06:43.121\nI'm implying it.\n\n1152\n01:06:43.121 --> 01:06:44.910\n[LAUGH]\n>> No,\n\n1153\n01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:50.710\nI'm not saying there's any sort of\nbackdoor or anything like that.\n\n1154\n01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:54.140\nBut it was rumored for a long time,\n\n1155\n01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:58.610\nstill pops up, that they may have had\na hand in fine tuning and tweaking it\n\n1156\n01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:04.210\nwith the people that made the algorithm\nto make it just that much stronger.\n\n1157\n01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:05.661\nBut-\n>> And create a master key that they can\n\n1158\n01:07:05.661 --> 01:07:06.479\nuse to decrypt anything.\n\n1159\n01:07:06.479 --> 01:07:08.219\n>> Yes, a master key.\n\n1160\n01:07:08.219 --> 01:07:12.559\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But yeah, I don't.\n\n1161\n01:07:12.559 --> 01:07:16.575\nMy feeling is that it's more\nalong the lines of that they just\n\n1162\n01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:20.767\nmade some suggestions to them to,\nif they did anything at all.\n\n1163\n01:07:20.767 --> 01:07:24.001\nThey made some suggestions like,\nwell if you add this in here or\n\n1164\n01:07:24.001 --> 01:07:27.740\nif you make this change here,\nit'll actually bump it up to be stronger.\n\n1165\n01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:30.640\nCuz that happens in government\ncontracts and stuff.\n\n1166\n01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:34.240\nAnd all the time you get something and\nthey're not happy with the final product.\n\n1167\n01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:41.740\nThey might ask you to do something here or\nthere to bring it up to what they want.\n\n1168\n01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:46.350\nAnd that may have been close enough that,\nNSA if they did anything at all,\n\n1169\n01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:48.920\nmay have said well we need you to do this,\nthis and this.\n\n1170\n01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:52.520\nAnd that'll be much, much better for\nus and be much more comfortable with it.\n\n1171\n01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.650\nBut that's kinda the story with that one.\n\n1172\n01:07:55.650 --> 01:08:01.140\nSo some people will say Rijndael and\nAES there is a difference between the two,\n\n1173\n01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:05.970\neven though for just about all intents and\npurpose, it's imperceptible.\n\n1174\n01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:08.680\n>> I think one of the things they did was,\n\n1175\n01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.560\nthey picked which key\nlengths they want to allow.\n\n1176\n01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.836\nLike Rijndael might have allowed\nadditional key lengths, some shorter,\n\n1177\n01:08:13.836 --> 01:08:16.908\nsome longer and they said look want\nthese three key lengths possible.\n\n1178\n01:08:16.908 --> 01:08:21.170\nOr something like that,\nif I remember correctly, so.\n\n1179\n01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:24.090\nBut, anyway, it's a lot of examples of\nsymmetric because you said that that's\n\n1180\n01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:25.080\nnot all of them.\n\n1181\n01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.160\nThere's many out there\nthat we might never see,\n\n1182\n01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.710\nthat maybe didn't quite make it, or\nare just not as common out there.\n\n1183\n01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:33.370\n>> Yeah, that's, that's really it.\n\n1184\n01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:38.420\nThere's there's a whole pile of\nthese things that are either being\n\n1185\n01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:44.721\nused in very obscure areas, or there's\nsomething that was just done for research.\n\n1186\n01:08:44.721 --> 01:08:51.632\nOr may have been just put on the scrap\nheap because they're no longer considered,\n\n1187\n01:08:51.632 --> 01:08:57.155\nor were never considered to be\nuseful beyond just a couple tests.\n\n1188\n01:08:57.155 --> 01:08:58.745\nThey found out that\nthere's a hole in them.\n\n1189\n01:08:58.745 --> 01:09:00.361\nJust get rid of it.\n\n1190\n01:09:00.361 --> 01:09:04.015\nSo that's happened many, many times.\n\n1191\n01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:07.335\nAnd it's going to happen many,\nmany, many more.\n\n1192\n01:09:07.335 --> 01:09:09.125\nYou'll read all sorts stories and\n\n1193\n01:09:09.125 --> 01:09:12.395\nstuff like that out there with\nthe different algorithms.\n\n1194\n01:09:12.395 --> 01:09:15.285\nYou probably heard the one\nabout the NSA with their,\n\n1195\n01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:20.540\nfrom the early '90s when\nthey wanted to put, in all\n\n1196\n01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:24.840\nwireless devices they wanted to put chips\nin there that had a special algorithm.\n\n1197\n01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.270\nIt did an escrow thing with them and\nyou gave them a key and all that.\n\n1198\n01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:33.440\nThey had an algorithm designed for\nthat too, and it was never put into use.\n\n1199\n01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:36.920\nYou can still go find it,\nit's not hidden or anything, but\n\n1200\n01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.940\nit's still out there, when.\n\n1201\n01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:44.657\nThat's just it, you're probably not going\nto see it on any major list, and you're\n\n1202\n01:09:44.657 --> 01:09:49.259\ndefinitely not going to see any real\nserious implementations any more, if ever.\n\n1203\n01:09:49.259 --> 01:09:54.975\nSo there's a lot to the story with,\nthere's a lot to the story on different\n\n1204\n01:09:54.975 --> 01:10:00.550\nsymmetric algorithms, so you could\nspend a lot of time looking at this.\n\n1205\n01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:02.758\nIf you really wanted it to.\n\n1206\n01:10:02.758 --> 01:10:03.290\n>> All right.\n\n1207\n01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:05.280\nWell very good information, Sean.\n\n1208\n01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:08.040\nI think we're going to\nwrap up this episode here,\n\n1209\n01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.460\nit's a good breaking point for us.\n\n1210\n01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.100\nSo, anything else we want to throw in for\ntoday?\n\n1211\n01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.570\n>> I think we had a pretty\ngood journey today.\n\n1212\n01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:19.150\nWith stuff we covered.\n\n1213\n01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:24.580\nWe talked about many different components\nof cryptography in our first episode.\n\n1214\n01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:28.350\nAnd then this one, we're talking about\nthe way the different algorithms,\n\n1215\n01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:31.600\nproceeding through it, giving you\na little closer examination on it.\n\n1216\n01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.650\nSo, I can't say there's\nreally too much to add.\n\n1217\n01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:37.550\nAnd I don't want anyone's head\nto go like scanner-style and\n\n1218\n01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:39.690\nexplode at this point in the day.\n\n1219\n01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:41.360\nSo, we'll let them off the hook.\n\n1220\n01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.210\n>> And we're saving all\nthe asymmetrics for the next episode.\n\n1221\n01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:47.560\nWe're gonna take a good deep\nlook at asymmetric encryption.\n\n1222\n01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.000\nA little bit more complex,\n\n1223\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.691\nso it's going to take us a little\nbit longer to go through it.\n\n1224\n01:10:51.691 --> 01:10:53.560\n>> Yes.\n>> All right, well ladies

00:00:37.590\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.640\nI'm your hose Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.225\nSean Oriyano, how you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:42.480\n>> Doing pretty good, how are you?\n\n7\n00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.920\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.340\nWe got another episode in our\ncryptography series coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.680\nThis is going to be a part two for\nthe algorithms and ciphers so\n\n10\n00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.340\nhopefully you guys saw\nthe previous episode, if not.\n\n11\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.340\nMake sure you back and watch that one.\n\n12\n00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.285\nAnd in our previous one we had talked\nabout just the basics of algorithms and\n\n13\n00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:01.990\nciphers.\n\n14\n00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.610\nAnd then we took a close look\nat some metric algorithms.\n\n15\n00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.550\nAnd now we wanna go back and\n\n16\n00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.040\ntake a look at that other type\nof algorithm that we have.\n\n17\n00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.370\nThe more modern stuff,\nthe asymmetric algorithms.\n\n18\n00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.870\n>> Yes, that's what we want to explore.\n\n19\n00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.750\nAnd just to kinda go quick, you know\nreview, so you understand where what\n\n20\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.210\nwe're talking about in this episode fits\nin with what we talked about previously.\n\n21\n00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.990\nWhat we had previously is\nwe talked about symmetric.\n\n22\n00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.580\nAnd if you remember, symmetric, what\nit is is that we have one key and that\n\n23\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.500\nkey either is gonna be used for encryption\nand decryption, it can be used for both.\n\n24\n00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.800\nIt just depends on whether you're handing\nplain text or cipher text to the actual.\n\n25\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.194\nTo the individual, so\nyou give them knowledge of the algorithm,\n\n26\n00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:59.770\ngive them a key and then give them\nwhatever and the process carries out.\n\n27\n00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.310\nAnd we saw that the algorithms\nwere very simple,\n\n28\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.870\nthey're very fast, they work very,\nvery well on bulk data.\n\n29\n00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.230\nAnd so those are all really great things.\n\n30\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.330\nLow work factors,\nyou know those types of things.\n\n31\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.320\nThen we saw downsides of it too.\n\n32\n00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.990\nOne of the downsides being key management.\n\n33\n00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.290\n>> Right.\n\n34\n00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.420\n>> This becomes a huge concern with key\nmanagement with these types of algorithms.\n\n35\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.142\nBecause you have to figure out how to\ndistribute the key to the different\n\n36\n00:02:30.142 --> 00:02:33.380\nparties that are going to encrypt or\ndecrypt data.\n\n37\n00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.510\nAnd it can be a big, big, big issue,\nconsidering that you have to figure\n\n38\n00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.820\nout an out-of-band secure method\nof getting that individual.\n\n39\n00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.020\nAnd then to add on top of that,\nwe also had the nonrepudiation.\n\n40\n00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.100\nThis system does not do nonrepudiation\nunless you get really creative with it,\n\n41\n00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.150\nwhich means you've got to generate\nunique keys for everybody.\n\n42\n00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.110\nAnd then distribute those keys to\neverybody else, which yesterday,\n\n43\n00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.600\nwe were kind of saying,\nwe're gonna ignore the whole thing of\n\n44\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.900\nwhat happens when you give\nsomeone else your key.\n\n45\n00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.140\nBut you can imagine, giving someone else\nyour key, you're kind of going like,\n\n46\n00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.330\nhey, Scouts' honor, I'm not gonna use it.\n\n47\n00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.935\n>> I promise.\n\n48\n00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:15.140\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's what you're saying, right?\n\n49\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.290\nI won't use it, you can trust me.\n\n50\n00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.660\nYou better have a lot of faith\nthat those people that you\n\n51\n00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.130\ngive it to are definitely\nnot gonna use that.\n\n52\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.080\nBecause that's a whole\nanother issue that comes in.\n\n53\n00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.910\n>> And the sheer volume of\nkeys that we had to generate.\n\n54\n00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.280\nI think we said if we have ten\nusers we're up to over 40 keys.\n\n55\n00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.090\nWe went to 100 users and\nwe had over 4,000 keys.\n\n56\n00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.700\n>> Yeah it was close to 5,000.\n\n57\n00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.380\n>> Yeah.\n\n58\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.820\n>> Or it was like 4950 or something.\n\n59\n00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.510\n>> It was pretty crazy.\n\n60\n00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.460\n>> It can be a crazy number of keys so.\n\n61\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.771\nThere's definitely some\nissues with symmetric,\n\n62\n00:03:45.771 --> 00:03:48.550\nand we have to find a way\nto deal with those.\n\n63\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.840\nAnd they found ways to deal\nwith those over the years.\n\n64\n00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.760\n>> We did those over those over the years,\nwhoo hoo!\n\n65\n00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n66\n00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.370\nYeah we did.\n\n67\n00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.420\n[LAUGH] Before the stuff we're\ntalking about today came into play.\n\n68\n00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.166\nFor symmetric they had to find really\ncreative ways of getting that key\n\n69\n00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:02.835\nout there.\n\n70\n00:04:02.835 --> 00:04:06.210\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They had to figure out methods like,\n\n71\n00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.300\nI'm going to write it down on a piece\nof paper and give it to somebody.\n\n72\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.400\nOr I'm going to just kind\nof go to that person and\n\n73\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.630\nwhisper it in their ear or something.\n\n74\n00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.360\nOr we'll just agree ahead of time.\n\n75\n00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.310\nOn certain days we will use certain keys.\n\n76\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.240\nAnd it had to be something like that\nwhere you were someone who that\n\n77\n00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.240\nperson you wanted to would have\nknowledge of but no one else would.\n\n78\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.920\nAnd so, why it was workable,\nit's a problem.\n\n79\n00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.840\nSo what they did is, that brings us to\nwhat we have today, is we have asymmetric.\n\n80\n00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.980\nAsymmetric is something that\ncame into play fairly recently.\n\n81\n00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:54.250\nThey had the idea for\nthis kind of a long a time ago,\n\n82\n00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.670\nbut it wasn't until someone\nactually put this on paper and\n\n83\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.500\nthen the computing power came along\nthat they could have asymmetric systems.\n\n84\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.470\nAn asymmetric, if you understand what\nsymmetric is and the world symmetric\n\n85\n00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.360\nmeans and what the world asymmetric means,\nit tells you what it is.\n\n86\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.970\n>> Pretty much.\n\n87\n00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.800\n>> We have here just a diagram with that.\n\n88\n00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.850\nWhat you have is with an asymmetric\nsystem, is you have a key pair,\n\n89\n00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.720\nwhich is illustrated right\nin the center of this.\n\n90\n00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.600\nThat key pair, they're mathematically\nrelated, and what happens is,\n\n91\n00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.445\nwhatever you perform with one key can\nonly be reversed with the other key.\n\n92\n00:05:32.445 --> 00:05:33.030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n93\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.110\n>> Doesn't matter which key you use,\nbut whatever key you do\n\n94\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.280\nuse to initiate the process can only\nbe reversed with the other one.\n\n95\n00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.680\n>> That's pretty impressive, isn't it?\n\n96\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.890\nYou've got this key pair,\nthey're generated as a pair,\n\n97\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.410\nthey're mathematically related, but\nif you have one of the keys, they'll\n\n98\n00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.140\nsay it's mathematically impractical for\nyou to figure out what the other key is.\n\n99\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.050\nSo if I had one of Sean's key,\n\n100\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.550\nI couldn't reverse engineer it to\nfigure out what the other key is.\n\n101\n00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.580\nAnd then whichever key used,\neither one can do the encryption,\n\n102\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.480\nwhichever one you use to encrypt with, the\nother one has to be used to decrypt it.\n\n103\n00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.030\nYou can't even use the same key\nyou used to encrypted it with.\n\n104\n00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.570\nYou have to have the other\nhalf of the key pair.\n\n105\n00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.280\nAnd that's really what makes this whole\nthing work, which we're gonna get into.\n\n106\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.800\nBut it's a pretty impressive system.\n\n107\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.800\n>> Yeah, that's what I thought\nwhen I first saw it too,\n\n108\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.680\nis that's, it is really,\nreally, really impressive.\n\n109\n00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.970\nTo put it in terms of something we saw\nwith symmetric, think of it this way.\n\n110\n00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.800\nIf we took that good old Caesar cipher,\nthat we've been talking about for\n\n111\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.260\nquite a long time,\nif we took the Caesar cipher and said.\n\n112\n00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.836\nHey you know, gonna use a key shift\nof three to encrypt everything,\n\n113\n00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:43.469\neveryone's cool with that but\n\n114\n00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:47.510\nif all of a sudden I said yeah to reverse\nthat you gotta use a key shift of 16.\n\n115\n00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.550\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n116\n00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.002\n>> Wow, time out,\n[CROSSTALK] I just messed you up but\n\n117\n00:06:53.002 --> 00:06:57.880\nthat's the way symmetric works,\nis that those keys.\n\n118\n00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.380\nBecause of the mathematics and\nall that that are involved with them.\n\n119\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.601\nThey're mirrors of one another, and so\nwhat you do with one can only be reversed\n\n120\n00:07:06.601 --> 00:07:10.003\nwith the other, but having possession\nof one in no way, shape or\n\n121\n00:07:10.003 --> 00:07:12.340\nform tells us what\nthe other one looks like.\n\n122\n00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.500\nIt's actually just incredibly\nfascinating when you look at it.\n\n123\n00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.300\nThere's a lot of mathematics involved\n\n124\n00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.450\nwhich plays into some of\nthe drawbacks of the system later on.\n\n125\n00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.590\nIt's a very, very cool system.\n\n126\n00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.082\nIt has its place where you could apply it.\n\n127\n00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:32.205\nWhere it's good to apply it, and\nthere's places where you can apply it but\n\n128\n00:07:32.205 --> 00:07:35.325\nit would not be the best scenario.\n\n129\n00:07:35.325 --> 00:07:39.905\nSo it was really cool that they were\nable to do something like this and\n\n130\n00:07:39.905 --> 00:07:43.452\ngive us something that solved\na lot of our problems that we\n\n131\n00:07:43.452 --> 00:07:45.342\nhave before was symmetric.\n\n132\n00:07:45.342 --> 00:07:47.472\nThey were solved over here.\n\n133\n00:07:47.472 --> 00:07:49.893\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n134\n00:07:49.893 --> 00:07:54.051\nI think this, and if I have my memory\nserved, this was about around the 70's\n\n135\n00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:57.393\nthat this came into play,\nthat there was a paper written on it.\n\n136\n00:07:57.393 --> 00:08:01.751\nAnd it really flashed out this\nis how that system works.\n\n137\n00:08:01.751 --> 00:08:03.918\nAnd so once that was in play and\n\n138\n00:08:03.918 --> 00:08:09.040\npeople were able to build their own\nsystems and make the thing happen.\n\n139\n00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.630\nAnd it's something we still\nuse today all the time.\n\n140\n00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:18.480\nIn fact, if this system didn't exist\na lot of the stuff that you enjoy today\n\n141\n00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.000\nas somebody on the Internet, they wouldn't\nexist, at least in the form they are now.\n\n142\n00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.350\nThey just would not exist and\nanything even close to that.\n\n143\n00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.340\n>> I couldn't do my online bill pay,\nI couldn't go to Newegg and\n\n144\n00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.780\nbuy all those cool computer parts.\n\n145\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.670\nYeah, there's a lot of\nthings that wouldn't happen.\n\n146\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.950\n>> Yeah, like that's what he says,\nwhat Bracey says,\n\n147\n00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.580\nit all has to do with\nprime number factors.\n\n148\n00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.510\n>> Right.\n>> I understood that all the way up to\n\n149\n00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.155\nthe word, with.\n\n150\n00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:43.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> After that, I don't know what.\n\n151\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.300\nI don't know if you\nneed to translate that.\n\n152\n00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.765\nBut that's-\n>> Has something to do\n\n153\n00:08:47.765 --> 00:08:50.031\nwith Optimus Prime and-\n>> Yeah, I remember that.\n\n154\n00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:52.320\n>> Remember he had painted on his truck or\nsomething.\n\n155\n00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.170\n>> Yeah, that was it.\n\n156\n00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.015\nI remember that episode.\n\n157\n00:08:55.015 --> 00:08:57.320\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\nso good old asymmetric.\n\n158\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.450\nNow Sean mentioned there at the beginning,\n\n159\n00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.630\nsymmetric means the same on both sides,\nright.\n\n160\n00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.490\nSo that's why we call that symmetric\nencryption, same key used on both sides,\n\n161\n00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.130\nencryption and decryption.\n\n162\n00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.330\nAsymmetric, not the same on both sides\n>> Different keys used, one for\n\n163\n00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.760\nencryption the other one then used for\ndecryption.\n\n164\n00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.370\nNot the same.\n\n165\n00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.970\nAlso known as public key\ncryptography as well.\n\n166\n00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.744\nThat'll make a little more sense as we\nstart giving these keys particular names\n\n167\n00:09:22.744 --> 00:09:24.680\nand tell you how they're used.\n\n168\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.177\nBut asymmetric public key cryptography,\nsynonymous there.\n\n169\n00:09:29.177 --> 00:09:30.110\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n170\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:35.360\nThey will say asymmetric a lot but\n\n171\n00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.860\nthe rest of us know it as public key,\nand it's the exact same thing.\n\n172\n00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.910\nSix on one and half a dozen on the other.\n\n173\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:50.160\nPublic key tends to be the term that is\nused much more widely than asymmetrics,\n\n174\n00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.970\nbut you can use both terms\npretty much interchangeably, and\n\n175\n00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.470\nnot have to worry about it.\n\n176\n00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.226\nBut, we're calling asymmetric for here.\n\n177\n00:09:59.226 --> 00:10:00.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For the most part,\n\n178\n00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.600\nwe'll use the publickey thing as well.\n\n179\n00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.120\n>> Yeah, I kinda like asymmetric.\n\n180\n00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.745\nOne, it's a little shorter and\neasier to say.\n\n181\n00:10:06.745 --> 00:10:08.180\n>> Yeah.\n>> I think that's what it is.\n\n182\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:12.200\nAnd it really does tell you exactly\nwhat it is, not the same on both sides.\n\n183\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.927\nSo I think it's a good\ndescriptive term to use.\n\n184\n00:10:14.927 --> 00:10:18.690\nPublic key cryptography starts making\nme think and it doesn't mean this, but\n\n185\n00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.040\nit does start making me think of certain\nproprietary systems that do this and\n\n186\n00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.380\nthat's not what it's meant to be,\nso I like asymmetric.\n\n187\n00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.240\nSo some characteristics of it we really\ntalked about a few of them, right?\n\n188\n00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.390\nThe fact that it uses a key pair.\n\n189\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:37.060\nNot just a single key, and\nit is based, it's heavy on math.\n\n190\n00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:43.990\nIt's got a lot of intense algorithms or\nciphers within there to do its job,\n\n191\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:48.700\nand to generate the keys themselves, some\npretty powerful math going on in there.\n\n192\n00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.150\nBut what makes it,\nlet's talk about some of the qualities,\n\n193\n00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.380\nsome of the things that we get\nthat we didn't get with symmetric.\n\n194\n00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.470\nI mean, why do we like asymmetric\nencryption so much if it's so\n\n195\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.860\nmuch more processor-intensive and\nmath-related?\n\n196\n00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:06.000\n>> The reason why it really is used so\nwidely,\n\n197\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.140\ncuz it seems like,\nyeah there's some definite problems here,\n\n198\n00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:16.210\nit performs slowly on\neven modern processors.\n\n199\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.019\nAnd even that we'll qualify that.\n\n200\n00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:18.660\n>> Right.\n\n201\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.630\n>> You have to make sure.\n\n202\n00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.915\nWe just can't say, oh it's slow.\n\n203\n00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:22.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's true,\n\n204\n00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.820\nbut you gotta flush that out a bit more.\n\n205\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:31.145\nSo the reasons why we use something\nlike this, is it does allow us to do\n\n206\n00:11:31.145 --> 00:11:36.320\nnon-repudiation, pretty\nfirmly does non-repudiation.\n\n207\n00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.290\nBecause if you go back to that key pair,\nthat key pair,\n\n208\n00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.180\nthis comes into what you were saying,\nMike, about it being called public key.\n\n209\n00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.600\n>> Is that there are names for those keys,\nthose keys are called a public key and\n\n210\n00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.860\na private key.\n\n211\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:54.580\nAnd yes they are mathematically related\nand which one's called the public and\n\n212\n00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.640\nwhich one's called the private\nreally doesn't matter.\n\n213\n00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.720\nIt's just who gets access to it,\nwhich defines which one's which.\n\n214\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.490\nIf you have a public key,\na public key is published someplace\n\n215\n00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:10.470\nwhere just about everyone,\nif not everyone, gets access to.\n\n216\n00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:15.330\n>> And then the private key is\nsomething that only an individual or\n\n217\n00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.410\nsmall group of people gets access to,\nhence it's called that.\n\n218\n00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:24.750\nAnd because of what we just talked about,\nthat you have one and\n\n219\n00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.740\nif you have possession of one you can't\ntell what the other one looks like.\n\n220\n00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.670\nThat's where the magic happens but\n\n221\n00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:36.605\nthe cool thing here is that on top of\nthat is if you have that public key.\n\n222\n00:12:36.605 --> 00:12:40.995\nAnd you're able to reverse an operation\nthat I did with my private key,\n\n223\n00:12:40.995 --> 00:12:45.275\nthen you know it's me even though you've\nnever seen my private key at all.\n\n224\n00:12:45.275 --> 00:12:48.585\nThat's really,\nreally powerful right there.\n\n225\n00:12:48.585 --> 00:12:52.595\nIn fact, that's what they\ncall a zero-knowledge proof.\n\n226\n00:12:52.595 --> 00:12:55.895\nThat's another formal term for it.\n\n227\n00:12:55.895 --> 00:12:59.300\nAnd it just means that in that situation,\n\n228\n00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.750\nyou proved that I had possession of\nthat private key without ever seeing it.\n\n229\n00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.410\nYou know that because my public key\nwas able to reverse that operation.\n\n230\n00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:12.377\nNow the only way I can reverse is if\nits cousin was somewhere involved\n\n231\n00:13:12.377 --> 00:13:13.610\nin the process.\n\n232\n00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:19.140\nWithout that, you never could have\naccomplished that whole thing.\n\n233\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.800\nHence, nonrepudiation.\n\n234\n00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.390\nSo really,\nreally neat when you think about that.\n\n235\n00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:28.130\nIt's just that cuz there's other places\nin life that that does happen in\n\n236\n00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.930\nthe real world, but it's really,\nreally tough to think of them.\n\n237\n00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.260\nA situation where, hey, I can prove\n\n238\n00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.640\nthat you're in possession of something\njust by holding something over here.\n\n239\n00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.540\nI mean, it does happen, but\nit's really just a tricky thing and\n\n240\n00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.090\nit really messes with your head a bit.\n\n241\n00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.680\nBut some things you gotta\ntake on faith I guess, right?\n\n242\n00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.080\n>> It is amazing, and let's just make\nsure everybody's clear on that then.\n\n243\n00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.390\nSo, when we talk about asymmetric,\nyou get issued a key pair, right?\n\n244\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.804\nThese get generated as a pair, and\n\n245\n00:13:56.804 --> 00:14:02.058\ntypically that the public key is issued\nto you as part of your certificate.\n\n246\n00:14:02.058 --> 00:14:05.274\nAnd if you remember back, if you're not\nfamiliar with this go back to our server\n\n247\n00:14:05.274 --> 00:14:06.820\nepisodes or go back to security plus.\n\n248\n00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.670\nRemember a certificate is a digital\ndocument that proves your identity or\n\n249\n00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:16.860\nverifies your identity, and the public\nkey is part of that certificate.\n\n250\n00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.880\nSo, it's tying that key\npair to your identity.\n\n251\n00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.836\nThat key pair now belongs to whatever\nidentity is that that certificate was\n\n252\n00:14:23.836 --> 00:14:26.114\nissued to, let's say a user in this case.\n\n253\n00:14:26.114 --> 00:14:29.058\nSo you get this certificate\nwith a public key in it, and\n\n254\n00:14:29.058 --> 00:14:32.644\nthen you get issued a private key,\nthe other half of that key pair.\n\n255\n00:14:32.644 --> 00:14:39.210\nAnd that has to be kept secret,\nonly you have access to that private key.\n\n256\n00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:43.880\nAnd so then what Sean was saying was,\nif we want to do non-repudiation,\n\n257\n00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.400\nif he encrypts something with his public\nkey which anybody can have access to.\n\n258\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.452\nWe published these certificates to\nActive Directory, post them on websites.\n\n259\n00:14:52.452 --> 00:14:54.845\nHeck, I can mail it out to everybody and\ntheir mother, whatever I want to do.\n\n260\n00:14:54.845 --> 00:14:59.255\nLet's see how we can do this.\n\n261\n00:14:59.255 --> 00:15:02.270\nIf he encrypts something\nwith his private key, right?\n\n262\n00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.000\nOnly he has access to that.\n\n263\n00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.270\nIf I can decrypt it using his public key,\n\n264\n00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.850\nthen I know it had to be\nencrypted with his private key.\n\n265\n00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.560\nBecause those guys are a key pair,\nthey work together.\n\n266\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.290\nSo if I can decrypt it with his public\nkey, which everybody has access to, then I\n\n267\n00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:22.420\nknow it was originally encrypted with this\nprivate key that only Sean has access to.\n\n268\n00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.690\nSo now I can verify that this came from\nSean, or it was encrypted by Sean,\n\n269\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.820\nand that's that non-repudiation, and we\nsee this in digital signatures on emails\n\n270\n00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.320\nis probably one of the first\nexamples everybody thinks of.\n\n271\n00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.170\n>> Oh yeah, it's,\nthey're very popular there,\n\n272\n00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.990\nin fact it's an integral\npart of that process.\n\n273\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.970\nIt's used on so many different areas.\n\n274\n00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:50.190\nWe have different combinations being used\non things like SSL and TLS use that.\n\n275\n00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.260\nThere's different variations.\n\n276\n00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.238\nThe thing I would tell you, and\n\n277\n00:15:53.238 --> 00:15:58.197\nit's easy to get really messed up on this\nwhen you are get it into asymmetric.\n\n278\n00:15:58.197 --> 00:16:00.197\nI see it all the time,\nI'm sure you've seen it all the time.\n\n279\n00:16:00.197 --> 00:16:02.578\nSomebody coming in new to it.\n\n280\n00:16:02.578 --> 00:16:07.175\nAnd even people like us we got to\nkind of be we got the right key.\n\n281\n00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.995\n>> Yeah.\n>> Make sure you're paying attention to\n\n282\n00:16:09.995 --> 00:16:15.168\nwhich key is in use and who and what\nthe scope of people have access to it.\n\n283\n00:16:15.168 --> 00:16:20.161\nWhat that means because which one you\nstart the process with was reset means\n\n284\n00:16:20.161 --> 00:16:23.460\nyou have to use the other one but\nthink about it.\n\n285\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.190\nOne, you've got exclusive access to,\none everyone's got access to.\n\n286\n00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:31.180\nYou can start encrypting with either one,\nand you can reverse with the other one,\n\n287\n00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.120\nbut there's serious implications\non which ones you start with,\n\n288\n00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.760\nare gonna to dictate what it is\nyou're trying to accomplish.\n\n289\n00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.010\nAnd you've got to be really,\nreally careful with that.\n\n290\n00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.786\nWhen you're thinking about\n[LAUGH] this whole thing.\n\n291\n00:16:42.786 --> 00:16:45.758\n>> Yeah, cuz you might be tempted to say,\nokay, if you're drawing this out or\n\n292\n00:16:45.758 --> 00:16:47.346\nyou're thinking about it in your head.\n\n293\n00:16:47.346 --> 00:16:49.786\nIf I wanna send an encrypted\ndocument over to Sean,\n\n294\n00:16:49.786 --> 00:16:53.270\nwell I'm gonna take my public key and\nI'm gonna encrypt that document.\n\n295\n00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.270\nI'm gonna send it to Sean.\n\n296\n00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.860\nWell, what key has to be used\nto decrypt that document?\n\n297\n00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.250\nIf I used my public key,\nit has to be my private key.\n\n298\n00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.620\nDoes Sean have access to my private key?\n\n299\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.560\nWell, let's say it was\nanybody other than Shawn.\n\n300\n00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.920\nShawn might because he's\na hacker extraordinaire.\n\n301\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.113\nBut hopefully.\n\n302\n00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:12.043\n>> I use my kung fu.\n\n303\n00:17:12.043 --> 00:17:12.844\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n304\n00:17:12.844 --> 00:17:13.889\n>> My ninja skills.\n\n305\n00:17:13.889 --> 00:17:17.315\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The idea is that only I have access to\n\n306\n00:17:17.315 --> 00:17:21.260\nthe private key, hence the name\nprivate key, so that's not gonna work.\n\n307\n00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.340\nSo if I wanna send Sean an encrypted\ndocument, what I actually have to do\n\n308\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:30.420\nis get a hold of Sean's public key,\nand encrypt it with that.\n\n309\n00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.740\nThat way, I can send it over to him and\nanybody can intercept that\n\n310\n00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.490\nencrypted document at this point, but\nonly Seann has the key to decrypt it.\n\n311\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.674\nSo it is easy to get twisted up into which\nkey you're starting with the process.\n\n312\n00:17:41.674 --> 00:17:45.871\nAnd a lot of people mistakenly think that\nthe public key is the only key that does\n\n313\n00:17:45.871 --> 00:17:48.987\nthe encryption,\nthat it always does the encryption, and\n\n314\n00:17:48.987 --> 00:17:51.800\nthe private key always\ndoes the decryption.\n\n315\n00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.550\nAnd that's not the case.\n\n316\n00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.040\nIt depends on what you're\ntrying to accomplish.\n\n317\n00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.520\n>> Notice when I was doing\nthe initial discussion of that,\n\n318\n00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.540\nI didn't even mention public\nprivate key initially.\n\n319\n00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.868\nWhen I was telling you,\nI was saying whatever you do with one,\n\n320\n00:18:06.868 --> 00:18:08.409\nyou reverse with the other.\n\n321\n00:18:08.409 --> 00:18:10.059\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's like Mike said,\n\n322\n00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:12.090\npeople always get that messed up.\n\n323\n00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.130\nThey come in, so I encrypt with the public\nkey or I encrypt with the private key.\n\n324\n00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.640\nAnswer's yes.\n\n325\n00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.197\n>> Yes.\n\n326\n00:18:17.197 --> 00:18:17.917\n>> Yeah, I do.\n\n327\n00:18:17.917 --> 00:18:19.089\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [INAUDIBLE] What?\n\n328\n00:18:19.089 --> 00:18:22.084\n>> The question is yeah, and\nI've had to happen to people.\n\n329\n00:18:22.084 --> 00:18:23.950\nWell, yeah, okay.\n\n330\n00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.088\nThat's the answer.\n\n331\n00:18:26.088 --> 00:18:28.803\n>> I tell you, a lot of times when\nI'm teaching this, I don't even use,\n\n332\n00:18:28.803 --> 00:18:31.766\njust as you did, I don't use those terms\npublic and private until later on.\n\n333\n00:18:31.766 --> 00:18:33.990\nI'll say the red key and the green key.\n\n334\n00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.580\nAnd if the red key encrypts it\nthen the green key decrypts it.\n\n335\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.990\nIf the green key encrypts it\nthen the red one decrypts it.\n\n336\n00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.640\nThat way we can kinda get\nthat concept down first\n\n337\n00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.260\nthen we'll label those keys later on.\n\n338\n00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.146\n>> Yeah, you don't wanna get too bound\nup in well this one encrypts and\n\n339\n00:18:49.146 --> 00:18:50.612\nthis one decrypts.\n\n340\n00:18:50.612 --> 00:18:53.177\nThey can both do either operation,\nthey just\n\n341\n00:18:53.177 --> 00:18:57.240\ncan't perform that same operation\non the same piece of information.\n\n342\n00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.130\nThat is never gonna happen.\n\n343\n00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:04.645\nSo I can encrypt with a key one time, and\nthen I can decrypt with the next time.\n\n344\n00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:08.215\nIt just means I can't encrypt it,\nlike oh we got to change that decrypt it.\n\n345\n00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:09.358\nNo your stuck.\n\n346\n00:19:09.358 --> 00:19:10.972\nYou can't do that at that point.\n\n347\n00:19:10.972 --> 00:19:14.048\nSo it's a significant thing.\n\n348\n00:19:14.048 --> 00:19:18.326\n>> And that kind of leads into our next\nadvantage of asymmetric encryption,\n\n349\n00:19:18.326 --> 00:19:20.189\nwhich was that key management,\n\n350\n00:19:20.189 --> 00:19:24.610\nbecause you might have picked up\nduring that conversation we just had.\n\n351\n00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:25.560\nBut Sean go ahead and\n\n352\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.070\nexplain it to them about how key\nmanagement is even easier with asymmetric.\n\n353\n00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.970\n>> Yeah,\nthat's exactly where that was leading,\n\n354\n00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.830\nif you were paying attention\nto what was going on here.\n\n355\n00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:39.360\nYou can kind of go back to\nwhat we had about symmetric.\n\n356\n00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.100\nRemember symmetric,\nI just talked about a few moments ago.\n\n357\n00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:46.080\nAs a quick review you, remember the way\nthe things work, crypt something,\n\n358\n00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.400\nnow the key has to somehow\nget over there too.\n\n359\n00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:54.500\nWell, in asymmetric you never heard in\nanything either one of us has said,\n\n360\n00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.490\nsaying that hey well, I encrypt something\nand now here's encrypted data and\n\n361\n00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.520\nhere's my key, never happened.\n\n362\n00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.713\nWe said for example,\nI encrypt with my private key and\n\n363\n00:20:04.713 --> 00:20:07.517\nthen he went to go get my public key.\n\n364\n00:20:07.517 --> 00:20:10.656\n>> Which was in active directory or\npublished on his website or\n\n365\n00:20:10.656 --> 00:20:12.830\nhe emailed it to me or what have you.\n\n366\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.410\nAnd the same thing, when I sent\nthat encrypted document to Sean,\n\n367\n00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:21.070\nI got his publicly available key and\nencrypted it and sent it over to him.\n\n368\n00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.982\nThe key needed for\ndecryption was never sent.\n\n369\n00:20:23.982 --> 00:20:27.080\nHe already had the key that\nhe needs to decrypt it.\n\n370\n00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:31.340\nSo I don't have that issue\nof key distribution anymore.\n\n371\n00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.406\n>> Yeah.\nIt's gone.\n\n372\n00:20:33.406 --> 00:20:37.942\nI guess you could say it takes on\na different form because you have to\n\n373\n00:20:37.942 --> 00:20:42.490\nfigure out where to put that public\nkey but that's a simple thing.\n\n374\n00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.920\nThat's easy for me to say, okay,\nwhere am I going to put that public key?\n\n375\n00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.200\nWell, I going to smack it on\na digital certificate and\n\n376\n00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.070\nthrow it over here and tell everyone\nthat's where it is if you need it.\n\n377\n00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.980\nGo over to that file cabinet.\n\n378\n00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.873\nThat's it.\n\n379\n00:20:52.873 --> 00:20:55.980\nI don't have to,\nafter you know that, that's done.\n\n380\n00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:00.750\nAnd if you look at something we're gonna\ninvestigate a little later to kind of put\n\n381\n00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.287\nthis, bring this more together with PKI.\n\n382\n00:21:03.287 --> 00:21:06.004\nProbably most if not all of\nus are familiar with that.\n\n383\n00:21:06.004 --> 00:21:07.791\nThat's what a certificate server does.\n\n384\n00:21:07.791 --> 00:21:10.290\nA certificate server is that file cabinet.\n\n385\n00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.890\nAnd people just trust that entity\nto have those things on file, and\n\n386\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.910\nbe the one that validated\neveryone's identity.\n\n387\n00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:21.680\nThat's where they get the terms like\ntrusted third party, and stuff like that.\n\n388\n00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.950\nSignificant thing there with\npublic key cryptography,\n\n389\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:29.040\nhandles that key distribution, and\nit's not even really distribution.\n\n390\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.100\nIt's like come and get it.\n\n391\n00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:30.901\n>> Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n392\n00:21:30.901 --> 00:21:32.870\n>> And that's it.\n>> You just make it available,\n\n393\n00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.710\nand anybody can come get it.\n\n394\n00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.610\nI don't care who has my public key.\n\n395\n00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.830\nEverybody and their mother can\nhave a a copy of my certificate.\n\n396\n00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:44.053\nAnd just to clear up now, I know you're\nsaying it's only public private for\n\n397\n00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:45.670\nweb servers and PGP or the like.\n\n398\n00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:49.280\nI'm not sure I'm following or\nif that was a question or a statement.\n\n399\n00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.760\nBut it's always public private.\n\n400\n00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.458\nAsymmetric that's what defines asymmetric\nencryption is you gotta public key and\n\n401\n00:21:55.458 --> 00:21:56.528\nyou have a private key.\n\n402\n00:21:56.528 --> 00:22:00.231\nThe private key has to remain\nprivate whether I'm an individual,\n\n403\n00:22:00.231 --> 00:22:04.467\nwhether I'm assigning this key,\nthis certificate to a piece of software or\n\n404\n00:22:04.467 --> 00:22:06.490\nit's a web server or what have you.\n\n405\n00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.056\nIt is public and private keys.\n\n406\n00:22:09.056 --> 00:22:11.935\n>> Yeah, I saw that too.\n\n407\n00:22:11.935 --> 00:22:15.672\nI'm not sure where you\nwere going with that.\n\n408\n00:22:15.672 --> 00:22:17.738\nSo you got phrase it in the form for\na question.\n\n409\n00:22:17.738 --> 00:22:18.887\n>> If you're asking a question-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n410\n00:22:18.887 --> 00:22:21.419\n>> Rephrase it for me just a hair.\n\n411\n00:22:21.419 --> 00:22:26.550\nSo key management really becomes a lot\nsimpler because I'm really managing those\n\n412\n00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:32.120\npublic keys and they're public, so I don't\nhave to be real super secret with them.\n\n413\n00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.226\nWith symmetric, I had to make sure only\nthe intended people got a copy of that key\n\n414\n00:22:36.226 --> 00:22:38.331\nso they could decrypt the information.\n\n415\n00:22:38.331 --> 00:22:42.780\nWith public private, with asymmetric, it\ndoesn't matter who gets that public key.\n\n416\n00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:43.600\nHence the name public.\n\n417\n00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.680\nI want everybody to have it.\n\n418\n00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.820\nBut that private key\nhas to remain private.\n\n419\n00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.671\nAs soon as that private key gets out,\n\n420\n00:22:50.671 --> 00:22:52.057\nif that gets exposed-\n>> Oops.\n\n421\n00:22:52.057 --> 00:22:52.975\n>> The whole thing's shot.\n\n422\n00:22:52.975 --> 00:22:53.836\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n423\n00:22:53.836 --> 00:22:57.620\nnow I've got a reissue keys because\nyou can't trust that key pair anymore.\n\n424\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.491\n>> Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n425\n00:23:01.491 --> 00:23:04.500\nWhat you were saying a few moments ago,\nyou only have access to your key.\n\n426\n00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:10.890\nIf I was in some way, shape or form able\nto grab your private key, I'm you now.\n\n427\n00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.027\nThere's nothing else really you can say-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n428\n00:23:13.027 --> 00:23:14.246\n>> At that point.\n\n429\n00:23:14.246 --> 00:23:18.448\nWhat he has to do is if he finds that his\nkey's been compromised then he needs to go\n\n430\n00:23:18.448 --> 00:23:21.651\nto whoever his system administrator is or\nsecurity person,\n\n431\n00:23:21.651 --> 00:23:26.269\nwhatever on site that handles that sort of\nthing saying, my key has been compromised.\n\n432\n00:23:26.269 --> 00:23:29.190\nAnd they will flag it as\nbeing out of service.\n\n433\n00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.700\nSo once I go to try to use that\ncompromised key it will show up as\n\n434\n00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.540\nno longer being valid, then we're good.\n\n435\n00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.040\nIf he doesn't know,\nthat's the other thing.\n\n436\n00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.500\nIf he doesn't know that\nkey's been compromised and\n\n437\n00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.670\nstuff starts going out that's been\nsigned by Mike and I'm doing it,\n\n438\n00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.920\nat some point someone's gonna come\nback to you and go, oh what the hell?\n\n439\n00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.950\nWhat's going on here?\n\n440\n00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:52.866\nAnd look at those things.\n\n441\n00:23:52.866 --> 00:23:57.367\nWell if that's the case and they can\ncheck probably through forensics or\n\n442\n00:23:57.367 --> 00:23:59.821\nmanagement something they look at it.\n\n443\n00:23:59.821 --> 00:24:03.669\nThen they could still say okay,\nwell, at that point, yeah, that key's\n\n444\n00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:08.350\nbeen compromised and we still need to go\nthrough and pull it out of circulation.\n\n445\n00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.380\nSo the privacy of that key is huge.\n\n446\n00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:18.960\nHeck, it'd be one of many, many,\nmany reasons why you should, especially if\n\n447\n00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.865\nyour working in this type of environment,\nbe locking your computer after you leave.\n\n448\n00:24:22.865 --> 00:24:25.354\nIt'd be very easy for\nme to plug in a flash drive or\n\n449\n00:24:25.354 --> 00:24:30.110\nsomething and extract your private key,\nand then what's gonna happen?\n\n450\n00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:34.546\n>> Once he has that private key, he can\ndigitally sign something, send it out.\n\n451\n00:24:34.546 --> 00:24:38.383\nOther people could obtain my certificate\nand my public key, decrypt it, and\n\n452\n00:24:38.383 --> 00:24:40.271\nthen they have to think it's from me,\n\n453\n00:24:40.271 --> 00:24:44.392\nbecause it was signed with my private key\nand I'm the only one that should have it.\n\n454\n00:24:44.392 --> 00:24:48.900\nOr the other way around, I might be\nencrypting a lot of stuff with my public\n\n455\n00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.310\nkey to keep my documents safe so\nthat only I have access to them.\n\n456\n00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.480\nHe now has my private key.\n\n457\n00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.380\nHe can decrypt everything I've\nencrypted with my public, so\n\n458\n00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:00.640\nit's a bad day when\nthe private key gets exposed.\n\n459\n00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.090\n>> This is why in environments there's,\n\n460\n00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:08.920\nyou can look them up online,\nthey call them CAC cards.\n\n461\n00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.750\nThe DoD and government positions,\nall that, use that here.\n\n462\n00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.500\nOther people use them too.\n\n463\n00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:20.450\nBut they will have a chip in them, and\nactually that chip stores private keys.\n\n464\n00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.390\nAnd if you lose that card, it's an ID, but\n\n465\n00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:29.710\nbecause it has that chip with those keys\nin them, there's a lot of things going on.\n\n466\n00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.090\nMore than just, hey,\nhere's my picture and here's who I am.\n\n467\n00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.160\nYeah, that's already a problem.\n\n468\n00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.810\nIf you lose your driver's license,\nthat's a problem.\n\n469\n00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.230\nBut if you have stuff that's got your\nprivate key that's unique to you,\n\n470\n00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:46.670\nif someone were to use that, then there's\nthe whole 'nother thing going on.\n\n471\n00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:52.030\nThat's why if you're in, for example, the\nmilitary and they're using those things,\n\n472\n00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:59.230\nyou loose that thing, and\nthey will have a conniption, man.\n\n473\n00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:03.620\nYou leave it in your computer and you walk\naway, someone's gonna have a discussion\n\n474\n00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.690\nwith you pretty quickly on that\nbecause they're just so sensitive.\n\n475\n00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.920\nBut other places use those too, and\nit's for the exact same reason.\n\n476\n00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.730\nI mean, yes, there's security\nmeasures on that, like PIN codes and\n\n477\n00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.320\nstuff like that to protect it, and\nall sorts of encryption in place.\n\n478\n00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.360\nBut still, we don't take chances.\n\n479\n00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.960\nIf you lose control of that thing, they\nwanna know, and you're gonna get a nice\n\n480\n00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.640\ntalking to, and they'll cancel\nthe old one and reissue a new one.\n\n481\n00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.294\n>> And yeah, to answer Ben's question\nthere, is it a one way function?\n\n482\n00:26:31.294 --> 00:26:31.850\nSort of.\n\n483\n00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.840\nI think I see why you're\nusing the term one way,\n\n484\n00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.220\nbecause if I wanna send encrypted\nmessage over to Sean here,\n\n485\n00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.000\nI would get his public key and\nencrypt it and send it to him.\n\n486\n00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.970\nHe'd use his private key to decrypt it.\n\n487\n00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:48.120\nIf he wanted to respond in kind\nan encrypted message, then he would yes,\n\n488\n00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.240\nhave to use my public key to encrypt it so\n\n489\n00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.170\nthat I would be the only one that\ncould decrypt it with my private key.\n\n490\n00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.375\nSo I see what you're saying.\n\n491\n00:26:57.375 --> 00:27:00.610\nIt is kind of, when you look at it\nthat way, it is a one way thing.\n\n492\n00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.290\n>> Just be careful when you\nthink of one way functions.\n\n493\n00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.922\nSee, I would say that-\n>> Terminology is a little-\n\n494\n00:27:06.922 --> 00:27:08.920\n>> I would be very careful with that,\n\n495\n00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.810\nbecause we do have something\nthat is a one way function, and\n\n496\n00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:16.390\nit's not asymmetric or public and\nprivate key cryptography.\n\n497\n00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:17.890\nIt has nothing to do with that.\n\n498\n00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:22.610\nCuz one way functions, that would be\nhashing, if you told someone that.\n\n499\n00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:25.670\n>> We could say it's separate\nprocesses on either side.\n\n500\n00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.600\nMaybe that would be a little\nbetter way to say it,\n\n501\n00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.460\nusing different keys on either\nside to do the encryption.\n\n502\n00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.830\n>> Yeah, I'd be a little\ncareful with that, you know.\n\n503\n00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:40.590\nSo I understand now what you're going for,\nbut be careful on that one.\n\n504\n00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.650\n>> All right, Sean, well, we got a lot\nof the characteristics and qualities.\n\n505\n00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.110\nLooking at the clock, it's about time for\nus to take a little break.\n\n506\n00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.530\nI know we wanna come back and talk about\n\n507\n00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:52.520\nsome of the drawbacks of asymmetric\nencryption, cuz there are a few.\n\n508\n00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.870\nAnd then talk about some of the different\nasymmetric encryption algorithms\n\n509\n00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.650\nthat we're gonna run into\nout there in the world.\n\n510\n00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:58.980\nSo stay tuned.\n\n511\n00:27:58.980 --> 00:27:59.830\nWe'll be right back.\n\n512\n00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:05.680\n[MUSIC]\n\n513\n00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.780\nAll right, welcome back,\nladies and gentleman.\n\n514\n00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.090\nContinuing on with our algorithms and\nciphers and, in particular,\n\n515\n00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.740\nour discussion of asymmetric\nencryption algorithms.\n\n516\n00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:17.660\nWe talked a little bit about what\nmakes an asymmetric algorithm and\n\n517\n00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.120\nsome of the characteristics and some\nof the positives that we get out of it.\n\n518\n00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.830\nThe whole fact that I don't have to deal\nwith the key management the same way.\n\n519\n00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.340\n>> Hoo [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, a lot easier there.\n\n520\n00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.440\nAnd the fact that we get non-repudiation.\n\n521\n00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.946\nThis is a system that will provide\nthat non-repudiation that we're always\n\n522\n00:28:32.946 --> 00:28:34.430\nlooking for.\n\n523\n00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.310\nBut there are some drawbacks, right, Sean?\n\n524\n00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:37.790\nThere's always some downsides.\n\n525\n00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:41.110\n>> Yeah, as the saying goes,\nyou don't get something for nothing.\n\n526\n00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:46.160\nSo this should be no surprise\nthat this is the case here.\n\n527\n00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.940\nSo you always need to be\nthinking about these.\n\n528\n00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:54.226\nAnd I'll tell you right away,\njust right off the bat here,\n\n529\n00:28:54.226 --> 00:28:59.089\nwhen you go into stuff like Security+,\nthe CISSP, or\n\n530\n00:28:59.089 --> 00:29:03.780\nyou go into ethical hacking,\nanything like that.\n\n531\n00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.920\nKnowing the difference\nbetween these two and\n\n532\n00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.340\nthe stuff we're specifically\ntalking about right now,\n\n533\n00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:14.120\nI mean, knowing which is which key to use\nand all those things, that's important.\n\n534\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.750\nBut there's other differences, and these\ndifference are hit on basically every one\n\n535\n00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.150\nof those cuz they want to make sure you\nknow that, because they're significant.\n\n536\n00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.660\nSo this has a definite application for\n\n537\n00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.510\nthose of you that are gonna be\npursuing those certifications too.\n\n538\n00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:31.190\nAnd even if you're not,\nthis is important for IT, period.\n\n539\n00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.530\n>> Great information for cryptography, and\nat the same time you're buffering up on\n\n540\n00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:40.050\nyour Security+ and your CISSP and\nyour CHFI and your CCFP,\n\n541\n00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:43.630\nand probably a whole other slew of\nacronyms that you can go take a test for.\n\n542\n00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:45.571\n>> Yeah, your EIEIOs or whatever [LAUGH].\n\n543\n00:29:45.571 --> 00:29:49.090\n>> It comes up in our server classes,\nin our server test as well.\n\n544\n00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:54.220\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of places where\nyou gotta know the difference of this, so\n\n545\n00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.799\nbe very careful when you\npay attention to this.\n\n546\n00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:59.290\n>> But your teacher used to stomp\ntheir foot or something, right, or\n\n547\n00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:00.951\ntap his chalkboard.\n\n548\n00:30:00.951 --> 00:30:03.591\n[CROSSTALK] Yes, this is going\nto be on the exam, hint, hint.\n\n549\n00:30:03.591 --> 00:30:08.740\n[LAUGH] All right, so what are some\nof the drawbacks of asymmetric?\n\n550\n00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:15.080\n>> Biggest drawback you'll notice under\nthe right conditions is, of course, speed.\n\n551\n00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.725\nAnd we've already kind\nof addressed that point.\n\n552\n00:30:16.725 --> 00:30:21.250\nWe said that symmetric is very simple,\nit's very quick and easy to do.\n\n553\n00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:25.010\nStuff just runs through there and\nthat's it.\n\n554\n00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:26.570\nIt just works.\n\n555\n00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.220\nBecause of the way those\nare architected and\n\n556\n00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:34.040\ndesigned, they don't need\na lot of processor power now,\n\n557\n00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.640\nor at least as much as what we're\ntalking about with asymmetric.\n\n558\n00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:43.434\nAsymmetric, because of the way it works,\nis much more processor-intensive,\n\n559\n00:30:43.434 --> 00:30:47.040\nand therefore, when you send stuff\nthrough it there is a performance hit.\n\n560\n00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.050\nIf you're talking a one-to-one basis,\n\n561\n00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:54.740\nyou will see a performance hit\non asymmetric versus symmetric.\n\n562\n00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.030\nSo it's not gonna be a race.\n\n563\n00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.922\nIn fact,\nfrom what I understand on average,\n\n564\n00:31:01.922 --> 00:31:08.120\nthe difference you can expect\nis about an order of about\n\n565\n00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:14.760\n1,000 times on average difference\nbetween the two in speed.\n\n566\n00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.170\nSo that's pretty significant.\n\n567\n00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:17.110\nSo that's also why,\n\n568\n00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:22.000\nwhen I was saying yesterday when you're\ntesting the two, I had referenced that.\n\n569\n00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.010\nIf you're testing the two,\nyou just can't throw a few bits through,\n\n570\n00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.240\nbecause you don't a watch that\nprecise that can do that.\n\n571\n00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.060\nBut if you send large chunks of data\nthrough, you will begin to notice it.\n\n572\n00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.980\nAnd that's where you're gonna start\nwhining about the whole thing and\n\n573\n00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.870\nbe like, why'd I do this?\n\n574\n00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:43.710\n>> And it's a great example of why we see,\nif we look at EFS, my encrypting\n\n575\n00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:48.690\nfile system, or if we look at SSL or\nTLS, they all use a combination of.\n\n576\n00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.380\nThey don't use just symmetric or\nasymmetric.\n\n577\n00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.794\nThey use symmetric to do\nthe bulk of the operation,\n\n578\n00:31:53.794 --> 00:31:55.820\nthe actual encryption of the data.\n\n579\n00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.621\nLike with EFS,\nyou've got your file encryption key.\n\n580\n00:31:57.621 --> 00:32:00.661\nThat's a symmetric key, and\nit does the bulk of the work.\n\n581\n00:32:00.661 --> 00:32:03.481\nAnd in the asymmetric algorithm,\nyour certificate and private key,\n\n582\n00:32:03.481 --> 00:32:06.751\nthe only thing they're protecting\n>> Is the symmetric key, right,\n\n583\n00:32:06.751 --> 00:32:08.011\nsame thing with SSL?\n\n584\n00:32:08.011 --> 00:32:12.414\nWhen you do SSL you're actually using\na session key that gets generated which is\n\n585\n00:32:12.414 --> 00:32:14.860\na symmetric key,\nto do the bulk of the data.\n\n586\n00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.550\nAll the data that's being transmitted\nback and forth between say you and\n\n587\n00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:18.790\nBank of America.\n\n588\n00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.310\nWhat's happening is you're making\na connection to Bank of America for\n\n589\n00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:26.380\nexample and you're saying prove to me that\nyou are the Bank of America web server.\n\n590\n00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.480\nAnd that Bank of America server\nsends back his certificate,\n\n591\n00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.950\nwhich proves his identity and\nhas his public key in there.\n\n592\n00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:36.260\nSo now my end is gonna generate\na session key, a symmetric key.\n\n593\n00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:40.290\nAnd I'm gonna take a copy of that key and\nI'm gonna encrypt it using Bank of\n\n594\n00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:43.360\nAmerica's public key that I\npull from its certificate.\n\n595\n00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.983\nNow I'm gonna send that\nencrypted symmetric key or\n\n596\n00:32:45.983 --> 00:32:48.500\nsession key back over to Bank of America.\n\n597\n00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.426\nDon't have to worry about\nanybody intercepting it,\n\n598\n00:32:50.426 --> 00:32:52.670\nbecause it's encrypted with\nBank of America's public key.\n\n599\n00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.552\nSo only Bank of America can decrypt it and\nget that session key or\n\n600\n00:32:56.552 --> 00:32:58.490\nthat symmetric key out.\n\n601\n00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:02.580\nNow we both have a copy of the same\nsymmetric key, that session key.\n\n602\n00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:06.420\nAnd we can use that to do the bulk of\nthe work of the actual encryption.\n\n603\n00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:11.940\nSo by combining them, we eliminated that\nissue we have with the distribution or\n\n604\n00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.280\nthe key distribution on asymmetric.\n\n605\n00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.390\nSo the asymmetrics, yeah.\n\n606\n00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:19.840\nA lot slower, it takes longer, so we\ndon't use it to do the bulk of the work.\n\n607\n00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.580\nWe use it to protect the symmetric key.\n\n608\n00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.670\n>> Exactly.\n\n609\n00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.061\nWhile I'm at it let me cross\nChapter 11 off the list.\n\n610\n00:33:25.061 --> 00:33:26.249\n>> [LAUGH] Oh.\n>> That took care of that.\n\n611\n00:33:26.249 --> 00:33:29.035\n>> Did I jump ahead?\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n612\n00:33:29.035 --> 00:33:29.607\n>> So stay tuned,\n\n613\n00:33:29.607 --> 00:33:31.288\nwe'll dive into that\neven deeper next week.\n\n614\n00:33:31.288 --> 00:33:32.625\n[LAUGH] Draw it out for you.\n\n615\n00:33:32.625 --> 00:33:34.823\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n616\n00:33:34.823 --> 00:33:37.654\nthe entire book summed up in five minutes-\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n617\n00:33:37.654 --> 00:33:39.046\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> CliffsNotes over here.\n\n618\n00:33:39.046 --> 00:33:40.393\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or you ruined the surprise.\n\n619\n00:33:40.393 --> 00:33:44.206\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I really should be the head I guess.\n\n620\n00:33:44.206 --> 00:33:45.469\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n621\n00:33:45.469 --> 00:33:48.000\nspeed thing one of\nthe big drawbacks of it.\n\n622\n00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.366\nAnother one, you've got simplicity.\n\n623\n00:33:50.366 --> 00:33:55.490\n>> Yeah, it is simplicity,\nyou might be able to argue this actually,\n\n624\n00:33:55.490 --> 00:34:00.580\nis asymmetric simpler than symmetric?\n\n625\n00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.498\nYes and no, it depends on your\nwhere you're addressing that,\n\n626\n00:34:03.498 --> 00:34:05.050\nwhere you posing that question?\n\n627\n00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.300\n>> I'm looking at prime numbers,\nand I'm saying that's so simple.\n\n628\n00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.520\n>> Yeah, if you lift up the hood and\nbe like.\n\n629\n00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.080\nDamn, [LAUGH] that's complex,\nI'm going over here with symmetric\n\n630\n00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:17.200\nthose things are magnitudes\nin different complexity.\n\n631\n00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:23.073\nBut, if you're talking just as on\na black box sense and how they work?\n\n632\n00:34:23.073 --> 00:34:25.561\nAsymmetric is way easier because again,\n\n633\n00:34:25.561 --> 00:34:28.554\nyou don't have to worry\nabout key distribution.\n\n634\n00:34:28.554 --> 00:34:32.730\nSo you've got that nonrepudiation and\nall those things taking care of it,\n\n635\n00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.030\ntaken care of for you.\n\n636\n00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:37.940\nSo yeah, it becomes much simpler\nto use on that end of it.\n\n637\n00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.740\nAnd so that's a big, big, big benefit.\n\n638\n00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:45.190\nYeah, you've gotta set up something like\nPKI which was Mike was talking about.\n\n639\n00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:47.040\nYou've gotta something like that.\n\n640\n00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.910\nBut that's only a one time deal and\n\n641\n00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:52.812\nthat's really in the scheme of things,\nit's not that complex.\n\n642\n00:34:52.812 --> 00:34:54.970\nMaybe some, somebody will\ndisagree with me on that, but-\n\n643\n00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:55.558\n>> Nah, I mean,\n\n644\n00:34:55.558 --> 00:34:57.323\nMicrosoft has wizards to deal with it all.\n\n645\n00:34:57.323 --> 00:34:57.905\n[LAUGH] I'm kidding.\n\n646\n00:34:57.905 --> 00:34:59.308\n>> Yeah.\n\n647\n00:34:59.308 --> 00:35:02.730\n>> It really is not that bad,\nas long as you understand the process and\n\n648\n00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.020\nwhat's going on.\n\n649\n00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.290\nAnd then another drawback\nis gonna be power.\n\n650\n00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.920\n>> Yeah.\n\n651\n00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:12.830\nI think we've beaten that horse to\ndeath at this point, is that yeah.\n\n652\n00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.860\nIt's much more processor intensive.\n\n653\n00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.690\nYou will be able to see a difference,\n\n654\n00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.510\nif you're talking and\nthe key word here is bulk data.\n\n655\n00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.630\nYou're talking large volumes of data.\n\n656\n00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:28.730\nThat's when that performance\na difference shows up.\n\n657\n00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:30.400\nWe're talking a small amount of data.\n\n658\n00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.620\nJust encrypting a key,\nlike we do in symmetric.\n\n659\n00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.240\nOr that we do with asymmetric\nto protect the symmetric key.\n\n660\n00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.645\nIf you're talking just that,\noh yeah, that's not even noticeable.\n\n661\n00:35:39.645 --> 00:35:42.245\nIt's there to be sure, it doesn't go away.\n\n662\n00:35:42.245 --> 00:35:45.406\nBut it's just negligible and no one cares-\n>> Exactly so-\n\n663\n00:35:45.406 --> 00:35:46.941\n>> But when you scale it up,\n\n664\n00:35:46.941 --> 00:35:49.135\nthen you definitely see it.\n\n665\n00:35:49.135 --> 00:35:52.348\n>> And so we're okay with that, we accept\nthe fact that it takes more power.\n\n666\n00:35:52.348 --> 00:35:54.136\nBecause we just know where to use it now,\n\n667\n00:35:54.136 --> 00:35:57.359\nwe know we're gonna use it where I\ndon't have a lot of things to encrypt.\n\n668\n00:35:57.359 --> 00:36:00.775\nThere's not a lot of information\nlike just that key, and\n\n669\n00:36:00.775 --> 00:36:05.262\nthat way that power drawback\ndoesn't really come into play.\n\n670\n00:36:05.262 --> 00:36:07.992\n>> Yeah, you're just doing\na tradeoff that's all it is,\n\n671\n00:36:07.992 --> 00:36:12.800\nyou're using the best of\nevery system to get a result.\n\n672\n00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:17.558\nAnd even if you were encrypting multiple\nsymmetric keys, you're requesting them and\n\n673\n00:36:17.558 --> 00:36:19.456\nencrypting and decrypting them.\n\n674\n00:36:19.456 --> 00:36:24.690\nIt still, it's negligible at that scale.\n\n675\n00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:26.160\nWe only really see this,\n\n676\n00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:31.650\nwe're talking large volumes of data and\nwe know, don't do that.\n\n677\n00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:36.480\nAnd I will tell you by the way,\nthere are some encryption\n\n678\n00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.960\nsoftware that could work just on a file\nand folder level that you can get.\n\n679\n00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.299\nI'm not talking EFS but\nthere are some third party ones,\n\n680\n00:36:42.299 --> 00:36:44.401\nthat they just throw\nencryption algorithms in it.\n\n681\n00:36:44.401 --> 00:36:47.330\nIt's just kinda like they said I'm\ntaking everything on this shelf.\n\n682\n00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:48.913\nThat's kinda what it looks\nlike what they did. >> [LAUGH]\n\n683\n00:36:48.913 --> 00:36:51.127\n>> They're only pay attention to it, and\n\n684\n00:36:51.127 --> 00:36:54.630\nyou can see the differences\nbecause they'll let you say it.\n\n685\n00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:59.270\nYou wanna encrypt this folder\nwith you pick the algorithm?\n\n686\n00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:02.560\nAnd so, those algorithms are a mish-mash\nof symmetric and asymmetric.\n\n687\n00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.980\n>> All right.\n>> Most people don't know that.\n\n688\n00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:08.992\nThey're just like okay, if that's designed\nfor the consumer they pick some off\n\n689\n00:37:08.992 --> 00:37:12.246\nthe list and go that looks good and\nif they choose anything at all.\n\n690\n00:37:12.246 --> 00:37:16.219\nAnd if they have a lot of stuff in there,\nit might be sitting in there when they\n\n691\n00:37:16.219 --> 00:37:20.273\npick that asymmetric one, they're\nwondering why they're sitting there.\n\n692\n00:37:20.273 --> 00:37:24.267\nTen hours later to encrypt\na folder of Word docs and JPEGs,\n\n693\n00:37:24.267 --> 00:37:27.830\nwhere symmetric would just be like that.\n\n694\n00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:32.388\nIt can make a huge difference,\na huge, huge, huge difference.\n\n695\n00:37:32.388 --> 00:37:38.290\nSo the power is substantial but,\nit solves a problem for us.\n\n696\n00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:44.140\nAnd so we combine symmetric and asymmetric\nor as you'll see, we've combined\n\n697\n00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:49.630\nthose with other encryption technologies\nto get a really effective crypto system.\n\n698\n00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:50.740\n>> Right.\n\n699\n00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.320\nAll right, so\nwe've got advantages of asymmetric,\n\n700\n00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.710\nwe've got disadvantages of asymmetric.\n\n701\n00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:56.950\nHow about some examples?\n\n702\n00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:59.750\nI know we went through a few different\nsymmetric algorithms yesterday.\n\n703\n00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.060\nDES, triple DES, AES, just to name a few.\n\n704\n00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:05.814\nRC4 I think we've talked about.\n\n705\n00:38:05.814 --> 00:38:06.670\n>> Yeah.\n\n706\n00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.505\nWe threw in a bunch of them.\n\n707\n00:38:09.505 --> 00:38:11.106\n>> Yeah.\n>> On asymmetric,\n\n708\n00:38:11.106 --> 00:38:14.380\nI just kept the list simple here.\n\n709\n00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:21.690\nYou have RSA, which is really old\nschool but still works incredibly well.\n\n710\n00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:26.660\nIn fact,\nit was the thing I mentioned about RSA,\n\n711\n00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:33.050\nis RSA was the first US\nmade asymmetric algorithm.\n\n712\n00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:34.678\nIt actually has that distinction.\n\n713\n00:38:34.678 --> 00:38:38.183\nSo just a piece trivia,\nno one's gonna test you on that.\n\n714\n00:38:38.183 --> 00:38:40.789\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] I didn't know that,\nthat's interesting.\n\n715\n00:38:40.789 --> 00:38:46.068\n>> It's just FYI but then we have ECC,\nelliptical curve cryptography,\n\n716\n00:38:46.068 --> 00:38:50.060\nwhich is actually kind\nof a fascinating one.\n\n717\n00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.160\nWhen you put it in context and\nunderstand it,\n\n718\n00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:58.740\nbasically what that one does is it relies\non the intersections of curves and lines.\n\n719\n00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:03.900\nIf you remember your math, they have\na parabola and a line drawn through it.\n\n720\n00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.740\nThey take the xy intercepts on it.\n\n721\n00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.180\nWell, they use that as\na seed to create the key.\n\n722\n00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:14.200\nWell, the thing is that the reason\nwhy something like that\n\n723\n00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:18.410\nIs an interesting thing and\nhas some interesting footnotes to it.\n\n724\n00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:21.500\nIs that ECC was,\n\n725\n00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:27.416\nit still is popular on devices where you\ndon't have a lot of processor power.\n\n726\n00:39:27.416 --> 00:39:33.110\nYou've got battery power or limited power,\n\n727\n00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:37.670\nso you got at least those two things and\nmaybe memory that's had a premium.\n\n728\n00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:41.190\n>> Phone is coming to mind when you\nsay limited processor, battery.\n\n729\n00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.070\n>> Exactly.\n\n730\n00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:43.270\n>> Phone comes to mind.\n\n731\n00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:46.205\n>> Yeah, a lot of mobile devices used and\n\n732\n00:39:46.205 --> 00:39:51.451\nstill do use this form of cryptography\nbecause it is very powerful.\n\n733\n00:39:51.451 --> 00:39:55.731\nIt's durable, so\nit stood the test of time.\n\n734\n00:39:55.731 --> 00:39:59.071\nAnd it doesn't require a lot of power.\n\n735\n00:39:59.071 --> 00:40:02.626\nDoesn't require a lot of memory and\nso therefore,\n\n736\n00:40:02.626 --> 00:40:06.773\nit's not gonna drain that\nbattery you have in that device.\n\n737\n00:40:06.773 --> 00:40:08.358\nI mean, think about it.\n\n738\n00:40:08.358 --> 00:40:14.477\nI've still got somewhere at home,\nI've got a graphing calculator from 84,\n\n739\n00:40:14.477 --> 00:40:21.360\n83, that did that, actually displayed it\non screen, and woo that was a big deal.\n\n740\n00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.780\nPeople were doing that on\ncalculators before that,\n\n741\n00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.290\nthat just used a couple of double\nA batteries or a 9-volt battery.\n\n742\n00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:30.650\nThey were doing in algebra class,\nin geometry, in calculus,\n\n743\n00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:33.170\nthey were doing xy intercepts with that.\n\n744\n00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:36.630\nIt doesn't require a massive\namount of horsepower.\n\n745\n00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:42.660\nI don't think anyone's gonna argue that\na calculator in 1970s is a supercomputer,\n\n746\n00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.890\nit has the power, it has something today.\n\n747\n00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:50.080\nSo you could very easily say, okay,\nif I can do those things there,\n\n748\n00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.910\nwith a little bit of work, I can make\nan algorithm that doesn't require a lot of\n\n749\n00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.920\nhorsepower but is strong and\njust carry it through a mobile device.\n\n750\n00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.990\nSo it proved very, very popular and\n\n751\n00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:03.870\nyou will see a lot of cases where you\nsee ECC, Electrical Curve Cryptography.\n\n752\n00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:08.690\nSometimes you see ECC1 put in there,\nbecause there were some tweaks and\n\n753\n00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:09.610\nvariations of it.\n\n754\n00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:13.390\nBut typically we just throw them\nall into the banner of ECC.\n\n755\n00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:20.250\nBut that's kind of a interesting little\nfootnote to that asymmetric algorithm.\n\n756\n00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:23.898\n>> I was really impressed when I got my\nfirst TI calculator that did the graphing\n\n757\n00:41:23.898 --> 00:41:24.471\nand stuff.\n\n758\n00:41:24.471 --> 00:41:26.249\nI thought I was the coolest\nguy on the block [LAUGH.\n\n759\n00:41:26.249 --> 00:41:29.140\n>> Yeah, mine was a Casio.\n\n760\n00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.556\nI forgot which one was the Casio\ndid all that, had that big screen,\n\n761\n00:41:32.556 --> 00:41:36.315\nI was like impressed, was like wow,\nI thought I was cool for that, but.\n\n762\n00:41:36.315 --> 00:41:38.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, the calculators before that\n\n763\n00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.840\ndidn't have to display it but\nthey could still do the math on it.\n\n764\n00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.590\nYou just had to throw the formula into it.\n\n765\n00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:46.202\nAnd they had programmable\ncalculators in the 70s.\n\n766\n00:41:46.202 --> 00:41:48.185\nMy brother had like,\nit was a TI something.\n\n767\n00:41:48.185 --> 00:41:49.253\n>> Yeah.\n\n768\n00:41:49.253 --> 00:41:51.465\n>> With the little red screen.\n\n769\n00:41:51.465 --> 00:41:52.318\n>> Yeah.\n\n770\n00:41:52.318 --> 00:41:54.400\n>> Give you a headache\nwhen you looked at it.\n\n771\n00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.010\nThose ones could do it.\n\n772\n00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.297\nSo it didn't require a lot.\n\n773\n00:41:59.297 --> 00:42:02.585\nIt was low tech and\nit worked there very quickly, so\n\n774\n00:42:02.585 --> 00:42:05.040\nit would work on the modern stuff too.\n\n775\n00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.280\n>> So it's an asymmetric algorithm that's\nreally reducing one of the big drawbacks\n\n776\n00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.400\nof using asymmetric, which is pretty cool.\n\n777\n00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.501\nSo now we got an asymmetric algorithm\nthat I can actually run on a phone or\n\n778\n00:42:14.501 --> 00:42:18.090\na tablet or something like that, that\nmight not have that same processing power.\n\n779\n00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:22.117\nWhere most of the other asymmetric\nalgorithms would choke a device like that.\n\n780\n00:42:22.117 --> 00:42:24.042\n>> Yeah, they could easily kill and\n\n781\n00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:27.020\nthrottle a device like\nthat pretty quickly.\n\n782\n00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:32.130\nGranted today's devices, they've got\nmore processor power than we had then,\n\n783\n00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:35.720\nso they don't necessarily need\nto use those as much anymore.\n\n784\n00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.420\n>> Right.\n>> But there are still some\n\n785\n00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.690\nlow footprint devices,\nsmaller devices that will use that.\n\n786\n00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:45.995\nBut it's just an interesting thing to\nsee that they actually have one that\n\n787\n00:42:45.995 --> 00:42:50.605\nworked really well, and they didn't\nthink of it at the time when they\n\n788\n00:42:50.605 --> 00:42:53.575\ndeveloped it that it would come in use for\nmobile devices.\n\n789\n00:42:53.575 --> 00:42:57.205\nBut, yeah.\nIt worked really well for those ones, and\n\n790\n00:42:57.205 --> 00:43:00.545\nso kind of stood the test of time.\n\n791\n00:43:00.545 --> 00:43:04.086\nIt's still used out there\nin a number of places.\n\n792\n00:43:04.086 --> 00:43:04.783\nYou'll still encounter it.\n\n793\n00:43:04.783 --> 00:43:05.921\n>> Yeah, all right.\n\n794\n00:43:05.921 --> 00:43:08.321\nAnd then we've got our\ngood old Diffie–Hellman.\n\n795\n00:43:08.321 --> 00:43:16.634\n>> Yeah, Diffie–Hellman is one that's\nkind of an odd ball in these three.\n\n796\n00:43:16.634 --> 00:43:19.689\nRSA, definitely an encryption algorithm.\n\n797\n00:43:19.689 --> 00:43:22.664\nECC, definitely an encryption algorithm.\n\n798\n00:43:22.664 --> 00:43:24.845\nDiffie–Hellman, key exchange protocol.\n\n799\n00:43:24.845 --> 00:43:26.053\n>> Right [LAUGH].\n\n800\n00:43:26.053 --> 00:43:26.610\n>> Yeah.\n\n801\n00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:29.530\nThat's what it is,\nit's the key exchange protocol.\n\n802\n00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:35.750\nBut what makes it such a,\nsomething that's good here,\n\n803\n00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:41.090\nis that it allows you to exchange\nkeys between two different parties\n\n804\n00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:46.040\nwithout either, without actually\nsending the key at any point in time.\n\n805\n00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:53.090\nIt's really, really, kind of a odd\n\n806\n00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:56.220\nor interesting or\ncrazy thing when you see it.\n\n807\n00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.420\nIn the easiest way to look\nat it is that you can,\n\n808\n00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.580\nif you wanted draw this on\na piece of paper or something.\n\n809\n00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:07.330\nIt's just to do some very,\nvery, very simple math on it,\n\n810\n00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:11.480\nis that if you had a party A and\nparty B, if there was,\n\n811\n00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.510\ntwo parties would do is agree on a number.\n\n812\n00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:16.960\nAnd we'll say they agree\non the number two, and so\n\n813\n00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.410\nthey both agree on the number two.\n\n814\n00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:19.994\nThen they go back in to their corner.\n\n815\n00:44:19.994 --> 00:44:23.739\nAnd they each generate their own\nnumber on top of the number two.\n\n816\n00:44:23.739 --> 00:44:27.523\nSo party A might generate four,\nparty B might generate three, and\n\n817\n00:44:27.523 --> 00:44:32.186\nthen what they do is they multiply the two\ntimes whatever number they generate, so\n\n818\n00:44:32.186 --> 00:44:33.700\nyou you get eight and six.\n\n819\n00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:38.460\nAnd then what they do is they\nswap those values to each other,\n\n820\n00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.100\nand then what will happen is\neight will take the six and\n\n821\n00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.380\nmultiply it by it's number it generated,\nfour.\n\n822\n00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.790\nSo you'll get 24 over here.\n\n823\n00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:46.850\nYou got three over here and\nyou've got eight.\n\n824\n00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:50.420\nYou're going to multiply eight\ntimes three, you get 24 over here.\n\n825\n00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:54.420\nAnd now all of a sudden you've\ngot the same number on both sides\n\n826\n00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.350\nwithout having to actually swap.\n\n827\n00:44:56.350 --> 00:45:01.340\nAnybody on the outside would only\nsee the two, the eight, and the six.\n\n828\n00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:05.824\nThey're not actually seeing\nthe final key ever cross the wire.\n\n829\n00:45:05.824 --> 00:45:07.760\nNow I've simplified that quite a bit.\n\n830\n00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.417\n>> Right.\n\n831\n00:45:08.417 --> 00:45:12.800\n>> Because you could conceivably factor\nthat and again brute force it and come up\n\n832\n00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:17.181\nwith the right key, but if you start\nputting in big prime numbers and all these\n\n833\n00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:22.320\nadvanced transformations in there, then\nit becomes a much tougher proposition.\n\n834\n00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.259\nIt's interesting we think about it\nbecause when you first look at it,\n\n835\n00:45:26.259 --> 00:45:28.580\nit's like well how does that happen.\n\n836\n00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.090\nWell, no matter which order\nyou multiply numbers in,\n\n837\n00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:33.630\nyou're gonna come up with the same result.\n\n838\n00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:36.472\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n839\n00:45:36.472 --> 00:45:37.920\nSo, that's what's happening here.\n\n840\n00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.230\nWe're just bringing numbers\ntogether in ways that you can,\n\n841\n00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:44.060\nthey're transmutable and all that.\n\n842\n00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:45.666\nSo it's-\n>> As long as they didn't know\n\n843\n00:45:45.666 --> 00:45:47.661\nwhat that initial number\nwas that we agreed upon,\n\n844\n00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:49.673\nnobody's gonna be able\nto get that information.\n\n845\n00:45:49.673 --> 00:45:53.933\n>> Well, even if they have that initial\nnumber we agreed upon, they have a two,\n\n846\n00:45:53.933 --> 00:45:57.750\nin my scenario, would they actually\nbe able to get anywhere with it.\n\n847\n00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:01.490\nSo they could actually at\nany point see three numbers,\n\n848\n00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:03.640\nthey'd see the two,\nthe eight, and the six.\n\n849\n00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.726\nBut they're never gonna see\nwhat the actual key is,\n\n850\n00:46:06.726 --> 00:46:11.304\nbecause that's actually multiplied and\narrived at on each individual one.\n\n851\n00:46:11.304 --> 00:46:14.817\nSo, it makes it very, very,\nvery, very, very tough.\n\n852\n00:46:14.817 --> 00:46:15.460\n>> Nice.\n\n853\n00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:19.015\n>> Diffie-Hellman also,\nlittle piece of trivia on it,\n\n854\n00:46:19.015 --> 00:46:24.136\nI guess the third guy that developed it,\nI think it's Whitfield was the name.\n\n855\n00:46:24.136 --> 00:46:30.057\n>> There was Whitfield Diffie,\nMartin Hellman, and was it Ellis maybe?\n\n856\n00:46:30.057 --> 00:46:31.701\nOh, Ralph Merkle.\n\n857\n00:46:31.701 --> 00:46:35.997\n>> Okay, yeah, there's other guys involved\nin the creation of that protocol.\n\n858\n00:46:35.997 --> 00:46:38.691\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I guess they didn't have a good agent\n\n859\n00:46:38.691 --> 00:46:41.035\nbecause Diffie-Hellman got credit for it.\n\n860\n00:46:41.035 --> 00:46:44.708\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Diffie and Hellman, though, I believe,\n\n861\n00:46:44.708 --> 00:46:47.955\nthe last time I checked,\nthey're both still around and\n\n862\n00:46:47.955 --> 00:46:52.420\nwhen people ask them they are pretty\nclear about yeah, it wasn't just us.\n\n863\n00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:56.770\nThere was other people and they're\ntrying to get, they've been trying for\n\n864\n00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:59.580\nyears to get more credit for\nthose guys coming in.\n\n865\n00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.650\nBut so far, once they got settled on that.\n\n866\n00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:04.390\n>> The name is stuck now.\n\n867\n00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:06.470\n>> Yeah, it's pretty much in.\n\n868\n00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:09.300\nAnd I think the other guy is like,\nwhatever, I don't care.\n\n869\n00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.497\n>> Just give me some of your money,\nI'll be all right.\n\n870\n00:47:11.497 --> 00:47:13.140\n>> Yeah, he doesn't mind.\n\n871\n00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.870\nI think the other guy may have\ndone some other stuff anyway,\n\n872\n00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:20.150\nso he's kinda like, okay, well whatever.\n\n873\n00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.630\n>> I know one of our people\nin the chatroom yesterday.\n\n874\n00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:24.210\nI apologize,\nI can't remember who posted it.\n\n875\n00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:28.380\nPosted that link about him being an expert\nwitness and they were like, well,\n\n876\n00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.260\nyou haven't taught any of these classes.\n\n877\n00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.674\nYou haven't got paid to do any of this.\n\n878\n00:47:31.674 --> 00:47:35.159\nHow is it you know so\nmuch about asymmetric encryption,\n\n879\n00:47:35.159 --> 00:47:36.949\nhe's like, I invented it.\n\n880\n00:47:36.949 --> 00:47:38.944\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe that makes me an expert in it,\n\n881\n00:47:38.944 --> 00:47:39.531\nI don't know.\n\n882\n00:47:39.531 --> 00:47:42.805\n>> Yeah,\nthat kind of wins you that argument.\n\n883\n00:47:42.805 --> 00:47:45.817\n>> Right [LAUGH].\n\n884\n00:47:45.817 --> 00:47:48.247\n>> It makes me think of something\nI had in a class years ago,\n\n885\n00:47:48.247 --> 00:47:50.541\nI had a network plus class\nI was teaching someplace.\n\n886\n00:47:50.541 --> 00:47:51.981\nAnd I had a guy there that was.\n\n887\n00:47:51.981 --> 00:47:54.761\nHe clearly knew everything.\n\n888\n00:47:54.761 --> 00:47:56.880\nI mean he was just like okay yeah,\nand he was throwing stuff in.\n\n889\n00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.460\nGuy had a way, way,\nway high level of knowledge.\n\n890\n00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.890\nAnd when I asked him later on,\nyou don't need to sit here, man.\n\n891\n00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.150\nWhy are you in this class?\n\n892\n00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:07.580\nYou know everything up here plus\na whole bunch of other stuff that I\n\n893\n00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:08.560\ndon't even know.\n\n894\n00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.022\nAnd there's stuff you've\nforgotten that I'm,\n\n895\n00:48:11.022 --> 00:48:14.081\nthan is more my body of knowledge\nis what's your experience.\n\n896\n00:48:14.081 --> 00:48:17.847\nEveryone else in the class started\nlaughing cuz they worked with them, and\n\n897\n00:48:17.847 --> 00:48:21.132\nthe guy says yeah I worked with\nthe team that set up the first couple\n\n898\n00:48:21.132 --> 00:48:22.410\nnodes on the Internet.\n\n899\n00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:23.419\nAnd like, you win.\n>> You win.\n\n900\n00:48:23.419 --> 00:48:26.590\nI don't get to say anything at that point.\n\n901\n00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.570\n>> I'm like what the heck is\nthis guy doing in my class?\n\n902\n00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:30.692\n>> That's like everybody slapping\ndown a coin, like oh, you win.\n\n903\n00:48:30.692 --> 00:48:31.950\n>> Yeah.\n\n904\n00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:33.410\nWhat am I doing, it's like I'm teaching,\n\n905\n00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:37.690\nit's like I'm teaching basic science\nto Einstein or Hawking or something.\n\n906\n00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:40.260\n[LAUGH] It's like,\nhere's the three states of matter.\n\n907\n00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.310\n>> Was it Al Gore?\n\n908\n00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:44.660\n>> Yeah, as luck would have it,\nit was Al Gore.\n\n909\n00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:49.425\n>> He didn't invent the Internet,\nby the way.\n\n910\n00:48:49.425 --> 00:48:52.018\n[LAUGH] And\nthat made me think of something else, and\n\n911\n00:48:52.018 --> 00:48:54.021\nthen it just went right out of my brain.\n\n912\n00:48:54.021 --> 00:48:56.920\nOh, we had a question in the chatroom.\n\n913\n00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:01.071\nBen was asking did RSA\nbuild on Diffie Hellman?\n\n914\n00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:02.730\nAre they related in that respect?\n\n915\n00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:07.420\nI know RSA came after Diffie Hellman did.\n\n916\n00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:10.580\n>> Yeah,\nthey've had some interactions with it.\n\n917\n00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:15.110\nI couldn't tell you off the top of my\nhead what those interactions were but,\n\n918\n00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:17.450\nyeah I believe they did have some.\n\n919\n00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:20.850\nI can't tell you did they\nbuild on it specifically.\n\n920\n00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.260\nI couldn't tell you that\nright off the top of my head.\n\n921\n00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:28.217\nI'd have to look at it, and\nI guess you could Google it too.\n\n922\n00:49:28.217 --> 00:49:33.089\n>> Yeah it might have been from our\nforensic investigator series cuz we\n\n923\n00:49:33.089 --> 00:49:35.916\nwere talking about expert witnesses.\n\n924\n00:49:35.916 --> 00:49:39.713\nAnd that's where Diffie was being called\nto stand to be an expert witness but\n\n925\n00:49:39.713 --> 00:49:40.931\nstill a funny story.\n\n926\n00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:43.330\n[LAUGH] I thought that was appropriate.\n\n927\n00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:43.910\nAll right.\nSo\n\n928\n00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:47.220\nwe've got a few different examples then,\nof our asymmetric encryption.\n\n929\n00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.950\nWe've got RSA.\n\n930\n00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:51.860\nWe've got their elliptical\ncurve cryptography.\n\n931\n00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:53.168\nWe've got Diffie Hellman,\n\n932\n00:49:53.168 --> 00:49:56.830\nwhich really isn't an encryption protocol\nas much as a key exchange protocol.\n\n933\n00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:00.060\nSo a lot of good examples there.\n\n934\n00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.140\nNext thing I wanna talk about or\n\n935\n00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:05.250\nwe wanna go over is gonna be these\nconcept called a one time pad.\n\n936\n00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:10.451\n>> Yeah, a one time pad just to quickly\nkind of summarize what this is and\n\n937\n00:50:10.451 --> 00:50:13.098\nto put its significance in place.\n\n938\n00:50:13.098 --> 00:50:19.590\nIs a one-time pad is a situation\nwhere you have a piece of plain text,\n\n939\n00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:25.030\nand then you have a key which needs\nto be as long as your plain text.\n\n940\n00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:30.180\nAnd you use a series of operations to\n\n941\n00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:35.010\ncombine the key with the plain text\nto arrive at a piece of cipher text.\n\n942\n00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:38.400\nAnd then someone can just reverse\nthat operation by having the key and\n\n943\n00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.100\nthe cipher text.\n\n944\n00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.661\nIt does have its issues, though.\n\n945\n00:50:42.661 --> 00:50:47.707\nOne of the biggest ones you have is\nthe out of band problem, is if you were\n\n946\n00:50:47.707 --> 00:50:52.990\ngonna give someone something that\nwas encrypted using a one time pad.\n\n947\n00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:55.310\nYou have to deliver\nthe cipher text one way and\n\n948\n00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.560\nthen you got to get the key\nto them another way.\n\n949\n00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:01.551\nIf anyone intercepts both\nof those it's game over.\n\n950\n00:51:01.551 --> 00:51:03.231\nThat's a big thing.\n\n951\n00:51:03.231 --> 00:51:06.693\nThe other one is,\nit can be considered to be a bit tedious,\n\n952\n00:51:06.693 --> 00:51:10.936\nconsidering that whatever length your\nplain text is, your key has to be\n\n953\n00:51:10.936 --> 00:51:15.130\nthe exact same length to make it\nwork the right way, so there's that.\n\n954\n00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:19.110\nIt is kind of clunky, and\nthen you've got that out of band scenario.\n\n955\n00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:25.680\nSo there are some things with it, but it\nhas the distinction of, one of the things\n\n956\n00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:30.910\nthat has distinction of being in the only\ncrypto system that's unbreakable.\n\n957\n00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:36.080\nAnd it's unbreakable only if you play by\nthe rules and that's why sometimes I've\n\n958\n00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:40.890\nsaid, yeah it's breakable because the weak\nlink in the system is a human being.\n\n959\n00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:45.540\nIf a human being gets lazy on that,\nwhich human beings do get lazy,\n\n960\n00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:49.720\nwhat's gonna happen is that you\nare going to reuse a key or\n\n961\n00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.150\nsomething very similar to a previous key.\n\n962\n00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:55.500\nAnd once you, we'll just say,\nyou're using the same key you did before,\n\n963\n00:51:55.500 --> 00:52:00.210\nonce you can do that,\nyou can look at two messages\n\n964\n00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:05.210\nthat were using the same key, and\nstart to discern patterns out of that.\n\n965\n00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:09.790\nAnd then someone can recover the key,\nand get knowledge of that system.\n\n966\n00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:13.940\nAnd that's just what you\ndon't want to have happen so\n\n967\n00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.950\nthere's some drawbacks to it.\n\n968\n00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:21.620\nAnd the thing is that you would think that\nhuman beings should be able to choose\n\n969\n00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:22.830\nthings like that randomly.\n\n970\n00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:26.682\nThey say that that's one of\nthe talents of human beings.\n\n971\n00:52:26.682 --> 00:52:29.170\nThey can choose random numbers and\n\n972\n00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:31.990\nstuff like that, those are the only things\nthat can really do that effectively,\n\n973\n00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:34.820\neven though they've since tackled\nthat problem in computer science.\n\n974\n00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.340\nThey found that while humans should\nhave that ability to choose just\n\n975\n00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:40.545\nrandom numbers let's say.\n\n976\n00:52:40.545 --> 00:52:44.270\nThey don't, human beings,\neven unconsciously,\n\n977\n00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:47.940\nif I said give me a number,\ngive me another number.\n\n978\n00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:53.030\nIf I did that over a certain amount\nof time, writing those things down,\n\n979\n00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:55.720\nyou'd start showing affinity\nto clusters of numbers.\n\n980\n00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.140\nIt's just something your brain does and so\n\n981\n00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.820\nthat will work with\nthe keywords on there too.\n\n982\n00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:05.530\nNow the thing is,\none time pads are not new.\n\n983\n00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:08.330\nThey go back quite a ways.\n\n984\n00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:13.620\nIn fact one really good example\nthat shows how they used them to\n\n985\n00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:18.830\nget the most bang for the buck out of it,\nwould go back to the World War II days.\n\n986\n00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:22.360\nAnd what they did is remember\nin the old black and\n\n987\n00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:25.270\nwhite movies, stuff like that,\nyou see the guy get in the sub or\n\n988\n00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:29.570\ngo out in the ship to sea and\nthey have the briefcase handcuffed to him?\n\n989\n00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:31.440\nAll Hollywood like and all that.\n\n990\n00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.930\nWell, that would be somebody that\nwas handling the code books.\n\n991\n00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:41.100\nAnd so our code books and the stuff for\npotentially one time pads.\n\n992\n00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.400\nAnd what would happen is,\n\n993\n00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:47.310\nis that these pads would literally\nbe something like a pad of paper.\n\n994\n00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:50.000\nAnd the way they generated the keys was,\nthey would get something like those\n\n995\n00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.080\nlittle, those things they use,\nthey do kino or something with.\n\n996\n00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.853\nAnd what they do is throw a bunch\nof Ping Pong balls in it.\n\n997\n00:53:55.853 --> 00:53:58.323\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they'd draw like letters or\n\n998\n00:53:58.323 --> 00:54:00.293\nnumbers on it, as the case may be.\n\n999\n00:54:00.293 --> 00:54:04.367\nAnd they'd throw them in this thing, and\nthey'd have a bunch of people in a room,\n\n1000\n00:54:04.367 --> 00:54:07.453\nand at different desks and\nit'd all be secure and sealed off.\n\n1001\n00:54:07.453 --> 00:54:09.239\nAnd these guys would say okay,\non the first,\n\n1002\n00:54:09.239 --> 00:54:10.793\non the first page we're gonna do this.\n\n1003\n00:54:10.793 --> 00:54:13.282\nAnd they'd start pulling balls out of it,\nand they'd read it,\n\n1004\n00:54:13.282 --> 00:54:14.953\nmake sure everyone got it, confirmed it.\n\n1005\n00:54:14.953 --> 00:54:17.993\nAnd then they'd put it back in and\ndo it again and keep pulling it out.\n\n1006\n00:54:17.993 --> 00:54:22.799\nAnd, hopefully after you got a sequence\nof characters you'd have something really\n\n1007\n00:54:22.799 --> 00:54:25.770\ntruly random, and\nit should be truly random.\n\n1008\n00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:28.690\nMathematically, taking the ball out,\nreading it, throwing it back in,\n\n1009\n00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:30.670\neach thing is independent.\n\n1010\n00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.954\nSomething that gamblers\nhaven't learned by now right?\n\n1011\n00:54:33.954 --> 00:54:34.730\n>> [LAUGH] I know right?\n\n1012\n00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:36.920\nI was just gonna say,\nit took me a while in Vegas and\n\n1013\n00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:41.250\na few, we won't say how much\nmoney to realize that fact,\n\n1014\n00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:45.280\nthat the last hand had nothing to\ndo with the outcome of this hand.\n\n1015\n00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.760\nBut it is a very important concept.\n\n1016\n00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:51.440\nAnd by putting that ball back in there,\nthe odds don't change.\n\n1017\n00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.640\nIt's like when you flip a coin.\n\n1018\n00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.680\nHeads or tails, right?\n\n1019\n00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:55.500\nYou wanna say, all right,\n\n1020\n00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.770\nthis come up heads three times in a row,\nthe next one is gotta be tails.\n\n1021\n00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:01.290\nNot really right.\n\n1022\n00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:01.860\n>> Yeah.\n\n1023\n00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:02.961\n>> The odds start over.\n\n1024\n00:55:02.961 --> 00:55:03.900\n>> Yeah.\nIt doesn't.\n\n1025\n00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:07.450\nThose are all independent situations,\nevery one of them.\n\n1026\n00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:12.190\nStrictly the results of that one are\nstrictly isolated from all the other ones.\n\n1027\n00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:14.380\nWhat happens before or\nafter means nothing.\n\n1028\n00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.960\nIt's that one point in time.\n\n1029\n00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:19.100\nIt's funny when you do see\npeople go to Vegas and\n\n1030\n00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:23.000\nlook at the numbers on the roulette wheel\nor something, or the slot machines.\n\n1031\n00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.920\nIt's time for it to do it, or\nthey look at the roulette wheel,\n\n1032\n00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:30.020\nthey spin the ball on it,\ngoing see that number's hit a lot.\n\n1033\n00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:31.341\nThat number's gonna hit again.\n\n1034\n00:55:31.341 --> 00:55:33.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so they're really, and\n\n1035\n00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:37.543\nthey really believe it, and so all it\ncomes down to is, I've done all my spots\n\n1036\n00:55:37.543 --> 00:55:41.711\non a roulette wheel but it's like\nstill a one out of 30 or 40 chance.\n\n1037\n00:55:41.711 --> 00:55:42.671\n>> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] numbers, yep.\n\n1038\n00:55:42.671 --> 00:55:48.110\n>> It's Always those same odds,\nso it is really, truly random.\n\n1039\n00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:50.660\nAnd I know some people have probably\nseen the shows where there's a group of\n\n1040\n00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.330\nstudents that went to\ncasinos around the world and\n\n1041\n00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:56.290\nwere able to look at the friction\non the wheels and calculate it, and\n\n1042\n00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:58.900\nable to determine which one's\nmore likely to come up.\n\n1043\n00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.430\nThat's not part of this, okay, so\ndon't say we're trying to pull that one.\n\n1044\n00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:03.730\nI'm on to you.\n\n1045\n00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:06.670\nBut that's the way this one worked is\nthat they would just spin the stuff in\n\n1046\n00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:09.960\nthis machine, pull a ball out and\njust keep doing that over and over again.\n\n1047\n00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.940\nOnce they filled up the sheet and\n\n1048\n00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:15.950\nall the different sheets in that pad,\nthey do that a few times and\n\n1049\n00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:19.180\nthey distribute them appropriately and\nthen go out into the field.\n\n1050\n00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:22.250\nHeadquarters would have a couple,\nthe other ones would be out in the field.\n\n1051\n00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:25.950\nIf a message needed to be transmitted,\nthey'd send a message encrypted with a one\n\n1052\n00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:30.290\ntime pad using a key, and\nthen along the way they'd say, when they\n\n1053\n00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:34.260\nwere transmitting that message, they'd\nsay it's pad something, sheet, whatever.\n\n1054\n00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:37.980\nAnd the person would go to that and\nlook at that sheet and decrypt it,\n\n1055\n00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.480\nand when they were done.\n\n1056\n00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.850\nIf they're playing by the rules they would\ntear that sheet out, crumple it up and\n\n1057\n00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:47.250\nburn it, destroy it whatever,\nit would never ever be used again.\n\n1058\n00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:52.440\nSo you had a very very low tech\nway of generating this stuff but\n\n1059\n00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:55.710\nit was still a very effective\nway of doing things.\n\n1060\n00:56:55.710 --> 00:57:01.040\n>> It truly is one of the only unbreakable\nencryption methods we can use,\n\n1061\n00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.470\nbut it is also very dependent\non humans doing the right thing.\n\n1062\n00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:09.420\nThat is, using keys that are as\nlong as the message itself,\n\n1063\n00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:13.430\nnever reusing a key,\nmaking sure the keys are truly random and\n\n1064\n00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:18.470\nbecause of that, it's not really a very\nefficient system, is it in the end?\n\n1065\n00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:22.180\nAnd for certain scenarios like that,\nlike you were saying, yes, but\n\n1066\n00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:24.690\nfor every day encryption, we don't see it.\n\n1067\n00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:27.790\n>> Yeah, it's not unheard of for\nthem to use it for, interestingly enough,\n\n1068\n00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:30.880\ndiplomatic channels.\n\n1069\n00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.085\nDistribute very sensitive stuff that way.\n\n1070\n00:57:33.085 --> 00:57:33.930\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But\n\n1071\n00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:37.360\nit's not something that's practical for\neveryday use.\n\n1072\n00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.360\nPeople have found different\nways to tackle it,\n\n1073\n00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:44.370\nbut it's questionable whether that's\nreally in the spirit of one time pad, or\n\n1074\n00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:49.020\nit's something that's been downgraded to a\ncertain degree by introducing other stuff.\n\n1075\n00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:54.770\nBut it is an effective system and\nit is unbreakable if used as designed.\n\n1076\n00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:59.210\nThe moment you start breaking up or\nusing it outside that\n\n1077\n00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:03.690\nsituation as designed,\nthen it starts to weaken pretty quickly.\n\n1078\n00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:05.100\nAnd so\n\n1079\n00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:09.170\nit's just something that you have to be\nvery disciplined to use the right way.\n\n1080\n00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:12.280\nIf you don't then it's just not for you.\n\n1081\n00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:16.888\nThat's again something that happened in\nthe second world war, the Germans used\n\n1082\n00:58:16.888 --> 00:58:22.840\nthat, and they reused keywords on\nthe system and once you do that.\n\n1083\n00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:26.050\nPattern analysis [CROSSTALK]\nelse comes in to play.\n\n1084\n00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:26.800\n>> Exactly.\nAll right,\n\n1085\n00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:30.800\nwell a lot of good information there\non our algorithms and cyphers.\n\n1086\n00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:34.640\nIn this episode we really focused on\nasymmetric encryption algorithms,\n\n1087\n00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:35.840\nand what they were.\n\n1088\n00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.730\nWhat makes an asymmetric encryption.\n\n1089\n00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:38.430\nHow they work.\n\n1090\n00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:43.420\nSome of the advantages and disadvantages\nof using asymmetric, and we also took\n\n1091\n00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:46.920\na look at the good old perfect\ncryptography, the old one time pad.\n\n1092\n00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.060\nSo Sean, anything else we wanna throw\nin here before we wrap this episode?\n\n1093\n00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:53.440\n>> No, I think we got it covered.\n\n1094\n00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:58.260\nI would just throw a little tip in here,\nlet me just put that in there.\n\n1095\n00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.590\nRemember from this point forward,\n\n1096\n00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:04.610\nyou've been briefed on the episode\nyesterday, the first part.\n\n1097\n00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:08.345\nAnd today, the benefits of symmetric and\nasymmetric.\n\n1098\n00:59:08.345 --> 00:59:12.625\nIf anything, remember\nthe differences between those two,\n\n1099\n00:59:12.625 --> 00:59:15.335\ncuz those are big, big, big deals.\n\n1100\n00:59:15.335 --> 00:59:21.007\nIf you've got that,\nyou're a long way towards understanding\n\n1101\n00:59:21.007 --> 00:59:25.307\nthose systems a bit better and being ahead\nof the curve of a lot of other people.\n\n1102\n00:59:25.307 --> 00:59:28.307\nIt's good if you know the algorithms\nthemselves within that.\n\n1103\n00:59:28.307 --> 00:59:30.916\nBut knowing the difference\nbetween the families,\n\n1104\n00:59:30.916 --> 00:59:32.740\nthat's the really really big one.\n\n1105\n00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:33.554\n>> Very good.\n\n1106\n00:59:33.554 --> 00:59:36.107\nAll right, well we wanna thank\neverybody for tuning in today.\n\n1107\n00:59:36.107 --> 00:59:37.777\nWe hope you enjoyed the episode.\n\n1108\n00:59:37.777 --> 00:59:40.457\nRemember if you ever have a question\nduring the show all you gotta do is go to\n\n1109\n00:59:40.457 --> 00:59:43.792\nthe chat room down below the video\nfeed and type in your question.\n\n1110\n00:59:43.792

00:00:34.593\nGood morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:34.593 --> 00:00:37.390\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.590\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.310\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.530\n>> Doing pretty good, how about yourself?\n\n9\n00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.910\n>> I am doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.380\nWe've got another episode coming\nyour way in our cryptography series.\n\n11\n00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.660\nAnd in this episode, Sean, we're gonna\ntalk about hashing and message digest.\n\n12\n00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.420\nPrevious episodes we've covered\nthings like symmetric encryption,\n\n13\n00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.730\nand then asymmetric encryption.\n\n14\n00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.880\nAnd this kind of follows suit\nwith our hashing algorithms.\n\n15\n00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.490\nSo let's dive in.\n\n16\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.970\nI guess we should start probably by\nexplaining, what the heck is hashing?\n\n17\n00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.440\n>> Yeah, hashing is a unique one based\non what we've talked about prior.\n\n18\n00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.030\nWhat hashing does is hashing is a form\nof encryption, but it's one-way.\n\n19\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.630\nIt's designed to be one-way and\n\n20\n00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.270\nit's not feasible to reverse it,\nis the way to put it.\n\n21\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.750\nSo as we had in the other techniques,\nwe can encrypt and\n\n22\n00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.730\ndecrypt, here you're just running\nsomething through the encryption process.\n\n23\n00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.236\nOn top of it, it's also designed not to,\nin any way, shape, or form,\n\n24\n00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:43.183\nprotect the confidentially of information.\n\n25\n00:01:43.183 --> 00:01:46.621\nIt's just not designed for that,\nit's not gonna to accomplish that, so\n\n26\n00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:47.793\ndon't even think that.\n\n27\n00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:52.125\n>> [LAUGH] I've always had a hard time\nsaying hashing encryption algorithms.\n\n28\n00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:54.401\nI can see hashing algorithm but,\n\n29\n00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:58.765\ncuz it really doesn't actually,\ndepending on how you look at it, right?\n\n30\n00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:01.865\nI mean, it does produce\nan encrypted form of the data, but\n\n31\n00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:04.375\nit's something that I can't reverse.\n\n32\n00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:07.135\nAnd the data itself that I ran\nthrough the hashing algorithm\n\n33\n00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:09.190\nis still sitting there plaintext.\n\n34\n00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.770\nSo it's kind of a tough concept sometimes,\nI think, to get past.\n\n35\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.770\n>> Yeah, and I think it's a fair point for\nyou to bring up, to be honest.\n\n36\n00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.296\nBecause yeah, as soon as you introduce\nthat concept and say it is encrypting,\n\n37\n00:02:23.296 --> 00:02:28.590\nthen you immediately go down the line of,\nit should be kept confidential.\n\n38\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.405\nAnd a lot of people in the first encounter\nwith this, they get caught up on that.\n\n39\n00:02:33.405 --> 00:02:37.175\nThey think it's something that if you run\nit through, there's an encrypted chunk of\n\n40\n00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:40.485\ndata sitting out there that no\none can read and you can reverse.\n\n41\n00:02:40.485 --> 00:02:44.610\nAnd that couldn't be farther from\nthe truth, that is not what this does.\n\n42\n00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.220\nIt creates a what they call a hash or\na message digest or\n\n43\n00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.630\nthere's a number of names you can call it.\n\n44\n00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.280\nBut it creates that little compressed\ncombination of characters,\n\n45\n00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.320\nbut then leaves whatever you put in,\nit leaves it whatever state it came in as.\n\n46\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.340\nSo, yeah, it's not designed to do\nwhat the previous algorithms did.\n\n47\n00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.296\nIt's designed to do something different,\ntackle a different problem,\n\n48\n00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:14.560\nwhich is the integrity problem,\nor detect modifications.\n\n49\n00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.477\nAnd don't kid yourself though, while\nit doesn't protect confidentiality and\n\n50\n00:03:19.477 --> 00:03:23.970\nit only does integrity, it is significant\nwhat this brings to the table.\n\n51\n00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.730\nI mean, there's just a tremendous\namount of things you can do with this.\n\n52\n00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.300\n>> And we see it everywhere, which we'll\ntalk about here as the episode progresses.\n\n53\n00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.146\nSo real quick, if you want to pull up my\nscreen, I can give you a chance to see\n\n54\n00:03:35.146 --> 00:03:38.770\nwhat we're talking about and\nkind of have Sean explain it to us again.\n\n55\n00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.480\nSo I start with plaintext here Sean,\nand what's going on in this thing?\n\n56\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.497\n>> Yeah, you guys can see here\nwhen you look from left to right,\n\n57\n00:03:45.497 --> 00:03:49.710\nyou've got plaintext, and\nit goes right through a hashing function.\n\n58\n00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.170\nAnd then what we get as the output of\nthat hashing function is we have a hash.\n\n59\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.380\nAnd, like I said,\nthat's only one name they call that.\n\n60\n00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.820\nBut they can call it a message digest\nas well, as well as other things.\n\n61\n00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.020\nAnd then there's the original\nplaintext on there too.\n\n62\n00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.019\nSo we still are able to read the message.\n\n63\n00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.815\nWhatever that plaintext was,\nwe can still process it and\n\n64\n00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:17.985\nconsume it, whatever we want.\n\n65\n00:04:17.985 --> 00:04:21.802\nAnd and as we said before,\nit doesn't have to be text.\n\n66\n00:04:21.802 --> 00:04:26.410\nSo it's the same rule applies here,\nwhen I say message,\n\n67\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.390\nyeah it could very well be a email or\ntext document, something like that.\n\n68\n00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.330\nBut that could also be binary too,\n\n69\n00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.540\nwhich is probably where\na lot of you have seen that.\n\n70\n00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.658\nBecause for example, hash, message digest,\nthose are only two of them,\n\n71\n00:04:36.658 --> 00:04:37.944\nyou don't wanna keep typing so\n\n72\n00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.556\nyou'll end up with a long thing-\n>> No,\n\n73\n00:04:39.556 --> 00:04:41.460\nit's not all gonna fit in my circle here.\n\n74\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.525\n[LAUGH]\n>> They also, you'll hear the term\n\n75\n00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:46.630\nchecksums, you'll hear thumbprints\n>> Yup.\n\n76\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.920\n>> Fingerprints you'll hear,\nI mean there's a number of things.\n\n77\n00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.550\nYou'll hear CRC sometimes thrown in there.\n\n78\n00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.970\nI mean, so there's a lot of terms\nyou could throw in and call it that.\n\n79\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.570\nBut I don't care what you call it,\nit's still the same thing.\n\n80\n00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.360\n>> Yeah, hash value, and if you listen to\nall those terms that Sean just mentioned,\n\n81\n00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.230\nyou get an idea of where you actually\nsee hashing being performed.\n\n82\n00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.200\nLike you said CRC or\ncyclical redundancy checks.\n\n83\n00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.810\nAll of our TCP/IP packets, right,\nhave that CRC in the trailer so\n\n84\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.340\nI can tell whether or not that\npacket has been modified in transit.\n\n85\n00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.370\nWe talked about signatures on files.\n\n86\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.420\nAll your Windows system files\nhave a digital signature so\n\n87\n00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.260\nthat the operating system can tell if\nyour system files have been modified.\n\n88\n00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.350\nThat's all done through hashing.\n\n89\n00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.540\nWe'll talk about later, passwords\nare typically stored as hash values.\n\n90\n00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.070\nSo you see it everywhere you look.\n\n91\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.290\nYou might not be aware of it but\nit's there.\n\n92\n00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.050\nWhen you download those versions of Linux,\nright?\n\n93\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.419\nThey've got that MD5 sitting there\nthat you're supposed to download or\n\n94\n00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.610\ncompare once you've finished\ndownloading it and running it.\n\n95\n00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.280\nAgain, to verify that integrity, so it's-\n>> Well heck, think of one,\n\n96\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.730\nwhile you're on that train of thought,\nthink of yeah, Linux distros have that.\n\n97\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.860\nBut look at one that,\nthis plays a huge role,\n\n98\n00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.870\nprobably more than you'd even\nprobably realize or appreciate.\n\n99\n00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.190\nWhat about your antivirus databases?\n\n100\n00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.950\nThe one thing you don't wanna\nhave is have a database get\n\n101\n00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.090\ndownloaded into your antivirus scanner and\nit was written by someone or\n\n102\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.196\nmodified by someone who\nhad bad intentions.\n\n103\n00:06:14.196 --> 00:06:15.447\nSo the manufacturers,\n\n104\n00:06:15.447 --> 00:06:18.950\nyou want to download that, guess what they\ngot sitting right next to the download\n\n105\n00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.530\nof that update if you're gonna\ndownload directly from their site.\n\n106\n00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.090\nThey have a checksum up\nthere that's telling you,\n\n107\n00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.730\nhey, you can check to make sure\nyou got the correct version.\n\n108\n00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.699\nSo it wasn't corrupted, modified,\nor anything else, it's the true and\n\n109\n00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.925\ncorrect version that you are supposed to\nhave and you're supposed to be using.\n\n110\n00:06:36.925 --> 00:06:41.910\nSo that's substantial and\nthen there's tons of other places that\n\n111\n00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.925\nthis technology's used\nthat you have encountered.\n\n112\n00:06:45.925 --> 00:06:48.199\nEither knowingly encountered or\n\n113\n00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.185\njust have taken it on faith\nthat something's happening.\n\n114\n00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:59.070\nSo it's a big, big, big technology that\nhas played a key role in a lot of stuff.\n\n115\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:05.390\n>> So a hashing algorithm is really\nwhat we call a non-reversible algorithm.\n\n116\n00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.490\nAnd the purposes are kinda\nwhat we just went over, right?\n\n117\n00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.960\nFirst big one is that I in the CIA triad,\nthat integrity, right?\n\n118\n00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.860\n>> Yes, it is doing integrity.\n\n119\n00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.820\nThat's its primary purpose in life,\nis to do provide a means of verifying\n\n120\n00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.340\nthe state of a piece of information, no\nmatter what that piece of information is.\n\n121\n00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.287\nAnd that's just substantial,\nit does that one thing but does it very,\n\n122\n00:07:31.287 --> 00:07:33.120\nvery, very well.\n\n123\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.620\nSo you don't have to worry\nwhen something comes your way.\n\n124\n00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.930\nIf you know how they originally hashed\nit and they give you that value,\n\n125\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.710\nif you trust them,\nwhoever provided you that message or file,\n\n126\n00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.580\nwhatever, you can do\nthe same thing on your end.\n\n127\n00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.826\nIf you get the same one,\nyou know you have the exact same thing,\n\n128\n00:07:52.826 --> 00:07:54.671\nthe integrity has been preserved.\n\n129\n00:07:54.671 --> 00:08:00.232\nAnd that's a very, very, very big deal.\n\n130\n00:08:00.232 --> 00:08:02.614\nSo we have that integrity being preserved,\nand like I said,\n\n131\n00:08:02.614 --> 00:08:04.685\nthey use it Just there's so\nmany different places.\n\n132\n00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:08.087\nYou're mentioning on packets.\n\n133\n00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:11.000\nThey use it for files.\n\n134\n00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.670\nThey use it even in databases.\n\n135\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.630\nTo accelerate searches.\n\n136\n00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.080\nHeck, if you've taken the ethical hacker\nor you're with us the last two weeks doing\n\n137\n00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.497\nthe forensic investigator, you already\nshould know the value of it there.\n\n138\n00:08:25.497 --> 00:08:28.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, a lot of stuff is like no go,\n\n139\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.110\nespecially in the forensics world,\nif you don't have that.\n\n140\n00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:37.470\nSo it's a big, big, big technology.\n\n141\n00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.910\n>> Right.\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n142\n00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:39.480\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n143\n00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.320\nthen it also comes into play\nin authentication as well?\n\n144\n00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.720\n>> Yeah, it plays a big role\nthere in authenticating data,\n\n145\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.580\nusually not on its own.\n\n146\n00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.720\nBut it does play a key role in that.\n\n147\n00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.990\nThat it has a way of verifying who it came\nfrom if you combine it with other things.\n\n148\n00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.690\nSuch as the aforementioned\ndigital signatures,\n\n149\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.040\nit plays a big, big, big role in that.\n\n150\n00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:14.170\nDigital signatures are a very,\nvery important part of your life nowadays.\n\n151\n00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:18.500\nEspecially you look at the Windows world,\nour drivers,\n\n152\n00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.730\nthey can't be installed in our Windows\nsystem now if you're on the 64 bit side,\n\n153\n00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.570\nyou can't install them unless\nthey're digitally signed.\n\n154\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:30.120\nAnd they're doing that to make sure that\nthose things have not been modified and\n\n155\n00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.980\nthey are authentic.\n\n156\n00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.900\nThey came from a reputable source.\n\n157\n00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.870\nSo that's a very, very big deal there.\n\n158\n00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.290\nNot to mention that it is used\nin other authentication systems.\n\n159\n00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:45.120\nWe see that in LM,\nNTLM and stuff like that.\n\n160\n00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.320\nThey're used there as well.\n\n161\n00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.460\nSo it plays a significant role\nin the authentication process,\n\n162\n00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.335\nwhich, we'll visit that.\n\n163\n00:09:52.335 --> 00:09:55.435\nSo we're not just gonna cast\nthat one off quite yet.\n\n164\n00:09:55.435 --> 00:09:59.630\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so let's talk about\nsome of the key terms and terminology.\n\n165\n00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.470\nWe kinda gave a few of these away already.\n\n166\n00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.530\nBut let's re-hash them.\n\n167\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.820\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n168\n00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.725\n>> Let's smoke this hash.\n\n169\n00:10:05.725 --> 00:10:06.370\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n170\n00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.402\nNo pun intended there.\n\n171\n00:10:08.402 --> 00:10:08.914\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:10:08.914 --> 00:10:10.980\n>> So in any case.\n\n173\n00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.820\n>> So the hash.\n\n174\n00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.870\nWe were talking about the hash.\n\n175\n00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.200\nThat's really the output.\n\n176\n00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.200\nOf the hashing algorithm?\n\n177\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.390\n>> Yeah.\nWhat I put here, and\n\n178\n00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.990\nthis is a short list of some of\nthe things, and I'll throw in some others.\n\n179\n00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:25.490\nBut yeah,\nthey can use this interchangeably, so\n\n180\n00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.050\ndon't get caught up that we're\ntalking hashing algorithm.\n\n181\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.610\nA hashing algorithm, yeah,\nit does generate a hash, but\n\n182\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.510\nI can go through and pull out with\nthe source, and say it's a message digest.\n\n183\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.270\nAnd you'll be like, whoa, wait a second.\n\n184\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.940\nI thought it was a hash.\n\n185\n00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.490\nYeah it is,\nyou just called it something different.\n\n186\n00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.110\nThat's it.\n\n187\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.970\nI guess in some circles they might argue\nthat with you and say oh well, no.\n\n188\n00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.350\nThat's a message digest.\n\n189\n00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.790\nI could care less about that,\nit's not important here.\n\n190\n00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:55.160\nTypically when you're talking\nabout something that goes\n\n191\n00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.542\nthrough a hashing algorithm and\ngenerates a unique value,\n\n192\n00:10:58.542 --> 00:11:04.900\nas long as that's what happens\nI don't care what you call it.\n\n193\n00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.500\nA rose by any other name.\n\n194\n00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.730\nRight?\nIt's the same type of thing.\n\n195\n00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.010\nSo, you know, they call them hashes,\nmessage digest.\n\n196\n00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:16.370\nI've put thumb prints on here,\nfinger prints they sometimes use that.\n\n197\n00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.040\nYou know, use check sums.\n\n198\n00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.730\n>> Signatures.\n\n199\n00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.350\n>> Yeah, signatures.\n\n200\n00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.900\nThere's a lot of different\nthings you can call it.\n\n201\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.920\nBut as long as it's accomplishing that\nsame basic prog, as a result of that\n\n202\n00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.400\nsame basic process we discussed,\nit really doesn't matter, it just doesn't.\n\n203\n00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.110\nAnd in fact,\nsome people get caught up on the fact that\n\n204\n00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:42.720\nwhen you talk about hashing algorithms,\nthere's actually\n\n205\n00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.860\nsome algorithms that if you look at the\nfull name, they're called message digest.\n\n206\n00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.100\nI'm like oh, it's a hashing algorithm,\nbut that generates a message digest.\n\n207\n00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.290\nThey get caught on that,\nit's like don't get caught on that.\n\n208\n00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.030\nThey call it message digest, fine.\n\n209\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:01.760\nAnd just FYI, the reason why they\ncall the term message digest came out\n\n210\n00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:08.840\nis that it literally is taking a piece\nof information, whatever it is,\n\n211\n00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.490\nand they're compressing it down to\na small digest version, a smaller one.\n\n212\n00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.255\nYou think of the one that always\ncomes to mind here, Reader's Digest.\n\n213\n00:12:17.255 --> 00:12:21.230\n>> Yeah, Reader's Digest is that\nsmall book, very condensed articles.\n\n214\n00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.880\nShort, sweet and to the point.\n\n215\n00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.795\nWhich is what you're doing.\n\n216\n00:12:23.795 --> 00:12:26.780\nYou're condensing all that\ninformation of whatever it is,\n\n217\n00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.725\nimage, margetechs, what have you.\n\n218\n00:12:28.725 --> 00:12:31.890\nYou're condensing it down\nto this little digest.\n\n219\n00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.760\n>> Yeah.\nThat's it.\n\n220\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.518\nThat's really the whole thing is that\nthey're just creating a digest form of\n\n221\n00:12:37.518 --> 00:12:41.779\nwhatever message or whatever you\noriginally shoved into the thing.\n\n222\n00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:44.030\nAnd so, it does make sense.\n\n223\n00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:48.945\nA hash,\nI can't be sure where someone decided-\n\n224\n00:12:48.945 --> 00:12:49.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n225\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.580\n>> to come up with that term.\n\n226\n00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.904\nIf someone was smoking the giggle weed-\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n227\n00:12:52.904 --> 00:12:54.145\n>> And said, let's call it a hash man.\n\n228\n00:12:54.145 --> 00:12:54.788\nLet's just do it.\n\n229\n00:12:54.788 --> 00:12:57.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] See if anyone says anything.\n\n230\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.470\nGot any Twinkies?\n\n231\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.920\nNo.\nAll right.\n\n232\n00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.800\nI'm gonna get in trouble for that one.\n\n233\n00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.610\n>> Yeah, yeah.\nWhatever that's all right.\n\n234\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.980\n>> But that's just it.\n\n235\n00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.010\nThat's where it came from.\n\n236\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.110\n>> All right.\n\n237\n00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.580\nSo we got some key terms then really.\n\n238\n00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.440\nJust a lot of different terms\nthat really mean the same thing.\n\n239\n00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.790\nI wanna make sure you're not confused when\nyou get out there and look at this stuff.\n\n240\n00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.300\nOr do any reading in any\nother books other than Sean's\n\n241\n00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.460\nfantastic book on cryptography.\n\n242\n00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.170\nThat you're familiar with\nthe fact that hash, hash digest,\n\n243\n00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.590\nmessage digest, hash value,\nthumbprint, signature,\n\n244\n00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.910\nwhatever they wanna call it,\nit's the output of a hashing algorithm.\n\n245\n00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.660\nAll right, so some key concepts that\nwe really need to understand what\n\n246\n00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.490\ndifferentiates these hashing\nalgorithms from the symmetric and\n\n247\n00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.680\nasymmetric that we were\ntalking about earlier.\n\n248\n00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.590\nFirst big one is that it's one way.\n\n249\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.370\n>> Yeah, it's always,\n\n250\n00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.450\nalways, always that, we said that\nin the intro, we'll say it again.\n\n251\n00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:57.420\nWe're doing it just to get that pounded\ninto your brains because that's something\n\n252\n00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.760\nthat people always mess up on, or it seems\nto be a very common thing to mess up on.\n\n253\n00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.910\nLike I said, you have trouble\ncalling it Encryption, and.\n\n254\n00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.990\n>> Yeah.\n>> I have that trouble myself.\n\n255\n00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.070\nWhen I go through and\nlook at that, it's just.\n\n256\n00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:11.820\n>> It frustrates me.\n\n257\n00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.853\nWhen you read a lot of these books,\nor when you're teaching some of these\n\n258\n00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:18.337\nclasses, they always throw in hashing in\nthis encryption algorithm section, and\n\n259\n00:14:18.337 --> 00:14:20.097\nI just don't feel like it belongs there.\n\n260\n00:14:20.097 --> 00:14:21.920\nBecause it's not encrypting my data.\n\n261\n00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.337\nIt's not protecting my data.\n\n262\n00:14:23.337 --> 00:14:25.158\n>> Are you dissing my book\non the air right now?\n\n263\n00:14:25.158 --> 00:14:27.860\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Not your book.\n\n264\n00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.600\nI'm talking about all those other books.\n\n265\n00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.570\n>> Yeah.\nYou know those damn authors that put stuff\n\n266\n00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.405\ntogether just to make a buck,\ncuz they're into royalties?\n\n267\n00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:35.040\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n268\n00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.710\n>> Yeah.\nIt's like I hate that.\n\n269\n00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.010\n>> But where else you gonna put it?\n\n270\n00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That is where it goes.\n\n271\n00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.200\nSometimes, when you're teaching\npeople that are newer to it,\n\n272\n00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.860\nit is a little difficult.\n\n273\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.780\nSo this one way, can't get the original\ntext back out once I've run it through.\n\n274\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:54.220\nI can't take that result and turn it\naround and get the original back out.\n\n275\n00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.360\n>> To be honest, theoretically you could.\n\n276\n00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.030\nIn some cases with\na improperly designed or\n\n277\n00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.460\nif you find the right trick to\na hashing algorithm you can extract it.\n\n278\n00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.410\nBut good hashing algorithms\ndon't really do that.\n\n279\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.550\nThey're not as susceptible to that,\nso theoretically you could but\n\n280\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:21.090\nin practice it's probably not gonna\nbe a common thing to accomplish.\n\n281\n00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.740\nThere's been some notable\nexceptions to that.\n\n282\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.210\nThere have been, but it's rare.\n\n283\n00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.820\n>> It really comes down to the way it\nworks, which we'll explain in a little\n\n284\n00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.860\nbit, which pretty much makes it\nto where it's not reversible.\n\n285\n00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.890\nSo one way, and one of the things I'm\nthinking of is your next point in here,\n\n286\n00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.950\nis that it's fixed length, right?\n\n287\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.890\nWhat do we mean by fixed length?\n\n288\n00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.620\n>> Yeah, that's a big one.\n\n289\n00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.860\nAnd that's something that's really\ngonna start to separate it.\n\n290\n00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.844\nWe already said it doesn't scramble\nanything, or just said it's one-way.\n\n291\n00:15:55.844 --> 00:15:59.984\nBut then to say that it's a fixed\nlength is another one that\n\n292\n00:15:59.984 --> 00:16:02.021\njust messes with your head.\n\n293\n00:16:02.021 --> 00:16:05.747\nAnd it is definitely gonna separate it\nfrom All the encryption stuff we talked\n\n294\n00:16:05.747 --> 00:16:09.471\nabout before, cuz you know if you look\nat the encryption stuff we had before,\n\n295\n00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:13.312\nthe output is going to be at different\nlengths depending on what the algorithm is\n\n296\n00:16:13.312 --> 00:16:17.045\ndoing to manipulate and transform\nthat data into it's encrypted format.\n\n297\n00:16:17.045 --> 00:16:19.735\n>> Well how much data I'm feeding into it,\nas well.\n\n298\n00:16:19.735 --> 00:16:21.865\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> If I feed a one page document versus\n\n299\n00:16:21.865 --> 00:16:24.785\na 20 page document,\nit's gotta encrypt all 20 pages so\n\n300\n00:16:24.785 --> 00:16:28.375\nthat output's gonna be a lot bigger than\nthe output from that one page document.\n\n301\n00:16:28.375 --> 00:16:30.180\nNot so with a hashing algorithm, though.\n\n302\n00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.410\n>> Yeah definitely not so.\n\n303\n00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:38.130\nWhat you get is when you put something\nthrough a hashing algorithm,\n\n304\n00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.380\nthe output of it,\nwhile will always be unique,\n\n305\n00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.750\nfor every input you put in,\nor it should be unique.\n\n306\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.893\n>> Yeah.\n>> We'll get to that in a second.\n\n307\n00:16:45.893 --> 00:16:47.158\n>> [LAUGH] That's nice.\n\n308\n00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:48.460\n>> But it should be unique.\n\n309\n00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.930\nBut no matter what you put through there,\nthe characters will be different, but\n\n310\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.280\nthe actual end result\nwill be the same length.\n\n311\n00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.530\nAnd that means I could take this\nin a digital form right here and\n\n312\n00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.450\nshove it through a hashing algorithm and\nI could get something,\n\n313\n00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.930\nwe'll just say it was 100 characters long.\n\n314\n00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.830\nOkay fine that hundred character long\nhash that uniquely identifies this.\n\n315\n00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:15.360\nThen that gets all of a sudden if I've had\nthe ability, have the whole Library of\n\n316\n00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.030\nCongress here in the US, I could have\nthe whole thing in digital format.\n\n317\n00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.380\nAnd just hash it using the same algorithm.\n\n318\n00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:26.665\nIt'll still be 100 characters,\nbut it will be different.\n\n319\n00:17:26.665 --> 00:17:27.220\n>> Yeah.\n\n320\n00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.410\n>> So there's gonna be differences,\n\n321\n00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.140\nand we're gonna talk about\nthat between the two.\n\n322\n00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.820\nBut it's always gonna be a fixed length.\n\n323\n00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.660\nThat fixed length is always\ndictated by the algorithm.\n\n324\n00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.615\nYou have no say in the matter, whatsoever.\n\n325\n00:17:39.615 --> 00:17:40.470\n>> Right.\n\n326\n00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.799\n>> You put two characters through,\nit's going to be 100 character hash, for\n\n327\n00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:44.364\nmy example.\n\n328\n00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:45.370\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> You put in a 1,000,\n\n329\n00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.810\nit will be a 100 character hash,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n330\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.780\n>> The output length is always the same,\n\n331\n00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.605\nno matter how much data you're throwing\ninto the algorithm in the first place.\n\n332\n00:17:56.605 --> 00:17:59.100\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> It's got a designated design\n\n333\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.680\nfixed length output.\n\n334\n00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:08.970\nAnd then that kind of leads right into\nour next topic here, which is collisions.\n\n335\n00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.190\nBecause of that fact, we end up with\nsomething called collisions, right Sean?\n\n336\n00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.594\n>> Yeah.\nCollisions are something that is,\n\n337\n00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:19.160\njust the word collisions makes\nyou think something bad.\n\n338\n00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:19.907\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah it is.\n\n339\n00:18:19.907 --> 00:18:22.730\n>> So you got a collision,\nyou don't want to hear that.\n\n340\n00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:27.620\nBut here, it's bad as well, but\nit's a different connotation.\n\n341\n00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.579\nThe easiest way to think of a collision,\n\n342\n00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:35.539\njust on the surface with a hashing\nalgorithm, is that you have two or\n\n343\n00:18:35.539 --> 00:18:39.145\nmore inputs that give you\nthe exact same output.\n\n344\n00:18:39.145 --> 00:18:40.220\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n345\n00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.950\n>> That should never ever ever happen.\n\n346\n00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.440\nIf that happens we've got\na serious problem, and\n\n347\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.220\nyou gotta look at it this way.\n\n348\n00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.380\nIf I've got two sheets of paper up here,\nthere's different things on both.\n\n349\n00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.870\nIf I feed both of these things\nto the same hash algorithm and\n\n350\n00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.900\nthey generate the same output.\n\n351\n00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.215\nWhich one's the one that's\nsupposed to be correct?\n\n352\n00:19:00.215 --> 00:19:01.180\n>> Right.\n>> You don't know,\n\n353\n00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.830\nit's the same fingerprint or\nhash that came out.\n\n354\n00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.470\nNow that that problem\n>> The signature, it no longer uniquely\n\n355\n00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.530\nidentifies that document,\nit identifies two different documents.\n\n356\n00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:14.950\nSo it's not unique anymore, and that was\nthe problem when we had the shorter,\n\n357\n00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:18.640\nthe older hashing algorithms\nthat had a shorter output.\n\n358\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.800\nThe problem is that if I've only got so\n\n359\n00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.630\nmany digits or\nbits available in my output.\n\n360\n00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.670\nHow many unique things\ncan I dump in there?\n\n361\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.040\nDoes it have enough unique\npossible outputs to cover\n\n362\n00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.930\nevery single thing I\ncould ever possibly hash?\n\n363\n00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:37.930\nAnd not so, and as we get into the hashing\nalgorithms that have the the longer\n\n364\n00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.220\noutput, it reduces the number\nof collisions, right.\n\n365\n00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.210\n>> Yeah, there's a potential there\nto reduce the amount of collisions,\n\n366\n00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.100\nbecause there's some other things\nthat can cause it on top of that.\n\n367\n00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:53.150\nSo we now know what a collision is,\nwhat can lead to it or\n\n368\n00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.880\nwhat things can be designed in or\nout of the algorithm\n\n369\n00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:02.100\nto prevent that from occurring,\nso you don't get the same output.\n\n370\n00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.960\nOne of the things that they do is,\nif you have a piece of data,\n\n371\n00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.940\nyou want to make sure that\nhashing algorithm samples or\n\n372\n00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.700\nuses as input,\nevery bit of the information put in.\n\n373\n00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.220\nSo you don't want it to doing\na sparse analysis of anything.\n\n374\n00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.713\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> You don't want to say like,\n\n375\n00:20:19.713 --> 00:20:23.520\ntake every tenth bit and shove that in\nthere and use that as input for the hash.\n\n376\n00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.353\nWhat I want to do is I want to take every\nsingle bit and that all gets fed in,\n\n377\n00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:30.032\nas input to generate it.\n\n378\n00:20:30.032 --> 00:20:34.398\nBecause it gives you more variation and\na lot more potential to have that\n\n379\n00:20:34.398 --> 00:20:38.932\nuniqueness, because you could look\nat some messages, statistically.\n\n380\n00:20:38.932 --> 00:20:42.172\nYou could have two entirely\ndifferent messages, but\n\n381\n00:20:42.172 --> 00:20:45.916\nif you do a sparse analysis of it and\nfeed in every so many bits,\n\n382\n00:20:45.916 --> 00:20:50.677\nthere's a possibility that those every\n10th or 20th letter could match.\n\n383\n00:20:50.677 --> 00:20:52.976\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> And that is gonna be a problem.\n\n384\n00:20:52.976 --> 00:20:57.941\nSo what we try to do is we, if we're doing\na good one, we use every bit of data that\n\n385\n00:20:57.941 --> 00:21:01.426\ncomes in, then we also have\nthe one that you mentioned,\n\n386\n00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:05.803\nusing a longer hash is typically or\ncreating a longer hash is typically\n\n387\n00:21:05.803 --> 00:21:11.380\nassociated with creating a stronger one,\nthat's a big characteristic of it.\n\n388\n00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.140\nAnd then you have other ones.\n\n389\n00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.020\nHaving a broader range of input that\ncan go in, not limiting the input.\n\n390\n00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.110\nWe've seen that before with passwords.\n\n391\n00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.420\n>> Right.\n>> Remember passwords.\n\n392\n00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.579\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you say, oh,\n\n393\n00:21:25.579 --> 00:21:27.770\nwell, you can only use letters and\nnumbers.\n\n394\n00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.590\nIf I cut off special characters.\n\n395\n00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:34.245\nI've substantially weakened your\nability to create passwords.\n\n396\n00:21:34.245 --> 00:21:35.020\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n397\n00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.938\n>> And so you don't want to do that.\n\n398\n00:21:38.938 --> 00:21:43.324\nSo you want to make sure\nthere's variation in there.\n\n399\n00:21:43.324 --> 00:21:45.853\nSo there is some very, very,\n\n400\n00:21:45.853 --> 00:21:51.840\nvery big deals that can make a hash\nalgorithm weaker or stronger.\n\n401\n00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.570\nAnother characteristic you'll see,\nand you can go online and find,\n\n402\n00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.908\nfor example, an MD5 generator.\n\n403\n00:21:58.908 --> 00:21:59.490\nThere's a ton of them.\n\n404\n00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.470\nMD5 being one of our hashing algorithms.\n\n405\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:09.121\nYou can find one of those things online,\nand you can start feeding stuff into it.\n\n406\n00:22:09.121 --> 00:22:11.721\nYou can try different phrases and\nthings like that.\n\n407\n00:22:11.721 --> 00:22:15.335\nAnd you should see,\nif you feed a phrase in,\n\n408\n00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:18.890\neven if you change one character in it.\n\n409\n00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.630\nLet's say I use my favorite.\n\n410\n00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:21.235\nI do, I type in.\n\n411\n00:22:21.235 --> 00:22:23.074\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Let's take a peak at it if you want.\n\n412\n00:22:23.074 --> 00:22:24.580\nI've got one pulled up and all.\n\n413\n00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.034\nI'll share this link with you\nguys here in just a second.\n\n414\n00:22:28.034 --> 00:22:30.578\nWhat do you want to put in as\nyour original text there, Shawn?\n\n415\n00:22:30.578 --> 00:22:31.419\n>> I don't know, surprise me.\n\n416\n00:22:31.419 --> 00:22:38.601\n[LAUGH]\n>> We'll say Link and Zelda.\n\n417\n00:22:38.601 --> 00:22:42.960\nAll right, what algorithm would we\nlike to use, cuz this one supported.\n\n418\n00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.650\nThis is a really cool little tool\nthat just lets you look at some\n\n419\n00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.870\nof the algorithms, what their output is.\n\n420\n00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:48.425\n>> Let's use MD5.\n\n421\n00:22:48.425 --> 00:22:51.455\n[CROSSTALK] talking about right there.\n>> All right, so we'll do a little MD5 and\n\n422\n00:22:51.455 --> 00:22:52.520\nclick Hash Now.\n\n423\n00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.490\nAnd there,\nhopefully you guys can see that.\n\n424\n00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.610\nI can zoom in just a wee bit on that.\n\n425\n00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:03.920\nAnd there, you can see that output or that\nresult is that hash value, that signature,\n\n426\n00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.720\nor that hashing algorithm.\n\n427\n00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.680\n>> Just for kicks, can you paste\nthat into Notepad or or something?\n\n428\n00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.730\nDo you have Notepad available?\n\n429\n00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:10.820\n>> I do.\n\n430\n00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.872\nLet's get just the number there.\n\n431\n00:23:13.872 --> 00:23:15.812\n>> Not to mess you up\nwhen you're doing it.\n\n432\n00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:18.927\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm the jerk that's like can\n\n433\n00:23:18.927 --> 00:23:19.491\nyou do this?\n\n434\n00:23:19.491 --> 00:23:21.233\n>> Yeah.\n\n435\n00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.911\n>> But, you know, so, yeah, that's a hash.\n\n436\n00:23:23.911 --> 00:23:26.530\nAnd what to do is, add anything to it.\n\n437\n00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.290\n>> If I hash that and it, well, first\nthing I'll do is, if I hash this over and\n\n438\n00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.660\nover, right, I'll hash it again,\nhash it again, hash it again.\n\n439\n00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.860\n>> Same thing.\n>> And if I take a look at that number,\n\n440\n00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.450\nand I go back over to Notepad and\nI put it in there.\n\n441\n00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:43.290\nYou'll see that it hasn't changed, so\nno matter how many times I run that data\n\n442\n00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:48.520\nthrough that algorithm it's always going\nto generate the exact same output.\n\n443\n00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.380\n>> Remember,\nwe talked about consistency, right.\n\n444\n00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.440\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> On algorithms,\n\n445\n00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.860\nthere you go, so it's consistent.\n\n446\n00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:00.163\n>> And if I just add a little exclamation\npoint to that, one little old character,\n\n447\n00:24:00.163 --> 00:24:00.859\nall right.\n\n448\n00:24:00.859 --> 00:24:03.076\nWe'll hash that same algorithm.\n\n449\n00:24:03.076 --> 00:24:06.442\nHash it one more time, and\nnow take a look at my output.\n\n450\n00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:14.340\nAnd we'll see that it is\nactually completely different.\n\n451\n00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:17.530\n>> Yeah, well, I can see some point.\n\n452\n00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:18.900\nYeah, the first letter.\n\n453\n00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.060\nIf we scan down that list,\nit's not nitpicking or anything.\n\n454\n00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.520\nI mean that's totally fine.\n\n455\n00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.502\nWe know MD5 is just fine as an algorithm,\nbut\n\n456\n00:24:26.502 --> 00:24:30.430\nit does illustrate the point\nthat I was gonna bring up here.\n\n457\n00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.808\nWhen you're talking about this is\nthat you can see that we have,\n\n458\n00:24:33.808 --> 00:24:35.070\nwell it's two hashes.\n\n459\n00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:38.400\nWe duplicated one to show\nthat it was consistent.\n\n460\n00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.899\nBut you can see when you look\nat those two hashes there,\n\n461\n00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:45.640\nwhat we're seeing is we're\nseeing a tremendous change.\n\n462\n00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.100\nReally it looks like we've got\nmaybe one character up top.\n\n463\n00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.810\n>> Let me get a little bit closer\ntogether so you can even get closer.\n\n464\n00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.890\nYeah, very few things\nline up in that output.\n\n465\n00:24:55.890 --> 00:25:00.640\n>> Yeah, I only see the one.\n\n466\n00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.890\n>> The one obviously but\nthere a little, yeah.\n\n467\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.480\n>> It might be spacing but who knows.\n\n468\n00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.694\nBut this is the thing, is when you're\ncreating a good hashing algorithm,\n\n469\n00:25:09.694 --> 00:25:12.424\nwhat we should have is we should never,\n\n470\n00:25:12.424 --> 00:25:19.040\never have a situation where there's a 50%\nor less change in the hash that comes out.\n\n471\n00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.030\nSo in this scenario,\nif Mike had typed in Link and\n\n472\n00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:29.520\nZelda and then put the exclamation\npoint on it and hashed again.\n\n473\n00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.640\nAnd he saw that the hash was almost\nentirely the same except for a few bits.\n\n474\n00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.680\nThat's not good.\n\n475\n00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.570\n>> Could be a bad thing.\n\n476\n00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:41.540\nThat means that you have a higher,\na much higher probability of a collision.\n\n477\n00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.110\nIt could be that it's\ndoing a sparse analysis.\n\n478\n00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.090\nIt could be it's not sampling\nthings the right way.\n\n479\n00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.180\nIt could just be the mathematics are off.\n\n480\n00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:53.630\nWhat we want to do for a hashing algorithm\nto even be considered decent it has\n\n481\n00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:59.010\nto show at least a 50% change,\nwhen you put two different inputs in it.\n\n482\n00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:04.560\nIf it's not at least 50%\nthen we've got a problem.\n\n483\n00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.947\nAnd you'll notice that this one,\nI mean what they just did there,\n\n484\n00:26:07.947 --> 00:26:09.060\nthat's-\n>> Major.\n\n485\n00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.310\n>> We saw one.\n\n486\n00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.130\n>> Yeah.\nOne obvious one and that was it.\n\n487\n00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.890\n>> Yeah.\n>> What if I go back to my original text?\n\n488\n00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.270\nI'll take that exclamation point back out.\n\n489\n00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.730\nI'll hash it one more time.\n\n490\n00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:22.560\nAnd we'll compare this guy.\n\n491\n00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.060\nPut it back over here and\nI'll just bump this down a couple.\n\n492\n00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:32.650\nAnd we're right back to the exact\nsame hash that we started with.\n\n493\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:37.650\nSo again, that input, if you put the same\nthing into that hashing algorithm,\n\n494\n00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:41.140\nit's always gonna generate the exact\nsame value on the way out, and\n\n495\n00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.490\nthat's what gives us the integrity, right?\n\n496\n00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:46.780\nThat's what gives us the ability to\nsay this is exactly the same as it was\n\n497\n00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.590\nwhen I sent it, right,\non that receiving end.\n\n498\n00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.260\nOr whatever we're trying to do,\nthis start up file has not been modified\n\n499\n00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.420\nbecause the signature is\nstill exactly the same.\n\n500\n00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.500\nThat means the document has\nto be exactly the same.\n\n501\n00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.110\nSo whatever you're using this hashing for\nis to provide that integrity.\n\n502\n00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:09.320\n>> And to build on something here,\nto give an example of this.\n\n503\n00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.100\nTake our what's poor hashing algorithm or\n\n504\n00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.880\nhashing system as we're\ngonna call it that.\n\n505\n00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.100\nWe could say algorithm is just fine.\n\n506\n00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.020\nWe've been through it.\n\n507\n00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.560\nWe went through an ethical hacker.\n\n508\n00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.370\nI know for sure we went through an ethical\nhacker, and I know it's been covered.\n\n509\n00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:28.430\nI haven't watched the whole\nlibrary of ITProTV stuff.\n\n510\n00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:30.640\nWait a minute, yeah I have\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n511\n00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.020\n>> Edit that out.\n\n512\n00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:37.523\nSo, anyway what we, I know it's\nbeen mentioned in other places,\n\n513\n00:27:37.523 --> 00:27:45.615\nan example of a really, really bad hashing\nalgorithm would be something like MIO LM.\n\n514\n00:27:45.615 --> 00:27:51.082\nThat's a horrible, horrible hashing\nalgorithm because they've limited\n\n515\n00:27:51.082 --> 00:27:56.002\ninputs on it, they've done little splits-\n>> Chopped it up in like seven\n\n516\n00:27:56.002 --> 00:27:58.152\ncharacters was all it took at a time.\n\n517\n00:27:58.152 --> 00:28:02.136\n>> Yeah and through padding it and stuff\nlike that and it just all these things\n\n518\n00:28:02.136 --> 00:28:09.266\ncombined it wasn't any really one thing\nthat made it really, really weak.\n\n519\n00:28:09.266 --> 00:28:12.006\nIt's just all these things that\nthey just threw into a pot and\n\n520\n00:28:12.006 --> 00:28:16.836\nsaid let's stir it around and hey,\ntada here's LM that made it horrible.\n\n521\n00:28:16.836 --> 00:28:21.106\nAnd so, that's one of the reasons\nwhy we don't use that,\n\n522\n00:28:21.106 --> 00:28:23.300\nwe avoid using that like the plague.\n\n523\n00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:29.390\nAnd if you haven't actually seen visual\nevidence of that, we've got a tool here we\n\n524\n00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:34.800\ncan show a little later on unless you've\ngot Cain and Abel on your system.\n\n525\n00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.770\n>> I don't have it installed but\nwe could grab it real quick.\n\n526\n00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:43.300\n>> Yeah, we can get that and\nshow you in just a little bit on that.\n\n527\n00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.950\nBut that one shows you right there,\nyou can see all the hashing algorithms and\n\n528\n00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.820\nCain and Abel,\nthey have a hash calculator.\n\n529\n00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.510\nYou can see right in there,\nall of them lined up.\n\n530\n00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:56.880\nAnd you can see that past a certain point,\nLM does squat for you.\n\n531\n00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.080\nNo matter what you put in, it's just\nfull of collisions all over the place.\n\n532\n00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.480\nIt just can't help it.\n\n533\n00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.760\n>> One of the big reasons it's not\nenabled by default anymore in our\n\n534\n00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.510\nmodern Windows operating systems.\n\n535\n00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.372\n>> Yeah, we just don't want it.\n\n536\n00:29:10.372 --> 00:29:13.393\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's too easy to break.\n\n537\n00:29:13.393 --> 00:29:16.740\nIt's extremely prone to collisions.\n\n538\n00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.080\n>> Yeah.\n>> Like my ex-girlfriend driving.\n\n539\n00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.500\n>> [LAUGH] I knew that was coming.\n\n540\n00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.370\n>> But yeah, it's bad.\n\n541\n00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:26.300\n>> That's why, and we'll illustrate it for\nyou, and you'll see it.\n\n542\n00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.610\nIs it on that,\nis LM on that list any place?\n\n543\n00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:31.130\n>> I don't know if LM is in here,\nI don't think so.\n\n544\n00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.390\n>> It's got a pretty good list, but-\n>> It does have a great list, and\n\n545\n00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.410\nI was just going to show you\nguys one more real quick.\n\n546\n00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.710\nAnd let's stick with the MDs, or\nno, let's try an SHA, a big SHA.\n\n547\n00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:43.960\nTake the same data, different algorithm\nthis time, what is it going to be?\n\n548\n00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.770\nThe same, or different?\n\n549\n00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.890\nJust a wee bit different, right.\n\n550\n00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.560\nYou guys can probably see that\nwithout me cutting and pasting.\n\n551\n00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.528\nSo the point is there when\nyou're comparing hashes,\n\n552\n00:29:58.528 --> 00:30:02.759\nyou definitely have to use\nthe same algorithm all right,\n\n553\n00:30:02.759 --> 00:30:07.270\nbecause there is a slight\ndifference between those two.\n\n554\n00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:11.410\nAnd even if you found two that you use,\nlike the second one I picked was 256, so\n\n555\n00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:16.690\n256 bits in the output, MD5 I think\nis 128 if I remember correctly?\n\n556\n00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.395\nBut even if I used two different hashing\nout rhythms that had the same fixed length\n\n557\n00:30:20.395 --> 00:30:23.850\noutput, that doesn't get the numbers\nstill wouldn't be the same right?\n\n558\n00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:26.980\nIt's a separate mathematical\nformula that's going on in there.\n\n559\n00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.100\nSo you have to use the same algorithm on\nboth ends when you're comparing integrity.\n\n560\n00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:35.479\n>> Yeah you can't just go through and\npull something off the list and\n\n561\n00:30:35.479 --> 00:30:40.270\nsay oh well they use an MD family,\nwe'll use an MD family one over here.\n\n562\n00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.917\nIt has to be the exact one, just like Shaw\nhas to be the exact one no matter which\n\n563\n00:30:43.917 --> 00:30:47.290\none you choose off that list or\nwhich one you choose wherever.\n\n564\n00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.660\n>> It's gotta be the same thing, but\nthat shouldn't be a surprise really.\n\n565\n00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.940\nIf you go look at\nthe encryption stuff we did.\n\n566\n00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.354\n>> Yep.\n>> You can't encrypt something with AES,\n\n567\n00:30:55.354 --> 00:30:58.220\nand then use DEZ over here,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n568\n00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:03.390\nSo it's the same type of deal here.\n\n569\n00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:05.540\n>> And if you look at those two\nthat I've just highlighted there.\n\n570\n00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.050\nThe first one was MD5,\nthat second one is MD4.\n\n571\n00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:12.770\nSo, you can see same family,\nbut not exactly the same.\n\n572\n00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.530\nSo MD4 and MD5, not the same output.\n\n573\n00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:16.770\nGotta use that same algorithm.\n\n574\n00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.780\nAll right, well Sean, probably a good\ntime for us to take a quick break.\n\n575\n00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:21.900\nSo, we're going to step away for minute.\n\n576\n00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.370\nAnd when we come back, more on hashing.\n\n577\n00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:25.430\nSo stay tuned.\n\n578\n00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.068\nWe'll be right back.\n\n579\n00:31:26.068 --> 00:31:34.056\n[SOUND].\n\n580\n00:31:34.056 --> 00:31:35.726\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n581\n00:31:35.726 --> 00:31:37.857\nSo, continuing on with our hashing and\n\n582\n00:31:37.857 --> 00:31:41.150\nmessage digest, we left off\ngetting ready to talk about some\n\n583\n00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:44.848\nof the different applications of\nhashing and where we might see it.\n\n584\n00:31:44.848 --> 00:31:49.073\nWe've hinted at a few and now let's break\nthem down a little bit further, and\n\n585\n00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:51.480\ngive some examples of\nsome hashing as well.\n\n586\n00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:57.100\n>> Yeah, there's a ton of places\nthat you can use hashing at.\n\n587\n00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.856\nAnd we've only got a few of them.\n\n588\n00:31:59.856 --> 00:32:06.074\nYou could actually get a bunch of other\nones if you really want to push it.\n\n589\n00:32:06.074 --> 00:32:10.752\nBut we'll just kind of get you in the zip\ncode to get you an idea of what you have.\n\n590\n00:32:10.752 --> 00:32:15.979\nSo, hashing you see it being used in\nthings like digital certificates,\n\n591\n00:32:15.979 --> 00:32:19.408\ndigital certificates\nvery commonly use MD5 or\n\n592\n00:32:19.408 --> 00:32:23.110\none of the shawl protocols\nit's just very common.\n\n593\n00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:27.959\nCuz you know, people, everyone knows\nthat one's been widely agreed upon.\n\n594\n00:32:27.959 --> 00:32:32.170\nIn fact MD5 was the standard for\na long, long, long time.\n\n595\n00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.700\nDigital signatures, it's been used\nthere forever, mainly because\n\n596\n00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:43.450\nyou can't have digital signatures without\na hash so it was used there forever.\n\n597\n00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.528\nThe thing that's interesting\ndigital signatures though,\n\n598\n00:32:46.528 --> 00:32:52.060\nas digital signatures,\nthis happened some years ago\n\n599\n00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:57.460\nhere in the U.S., it's happened different\nplaces in different parts of the world.\n\n600\n00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:02.200\nBut here it was in the late 90's I know\nbecause Clinton had signed it into law\n\n601\n00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.920\nthat digital signatures aren't\nconsidered to be legally binding.\n\n602\n00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.960\nForm about the late 90s forward in the US.\n\n603\n00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.290\nSo you can digitally sign\na lot of documents and\n\n604\n00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:21.120\nnever have to actually put pen to paper,\nit's just a done deal.\n\n605\n00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.550\nAnd you see that all over the place.\n\n606\n00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:28.960\nI mean, I think of for me when I purchased\nthe house I'm living in right now.\n\n607\n00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.710\nIt was, I bought it four years ago.\n\n608\n00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:36.220\nAnd you compare and contrast what\nI had to go through versus what my\n\n609\n00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.540\nparents had to go through\nwhen they bought their house.\n\n610\n00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:43.500\nMy parents were like, hey,\nwe got to stretch, stuff like this because\n\n611\n00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:48.260\nthey brought out a phone book that you had\nto sign every fourth or fifth page on.\n\n612\n00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:54.230\nWith the stuff that I did, there was maybe\nlike three sheets of paper I had to sign.\n\n613\n00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:57.230\nAnd one of them was that I was\nconsenting to use that system,\n\n614\n00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.260\nand it was notarized by\nsomeone else in there.\n\n615\n00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.030\nAnd then they set up\nan account in the system and\n\n616\n00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.870\nthey sent me all the documents that way.\n\n617\n00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.640\nAnd all I had to do was just click and\nsay, yep I agree.\n\n618\n00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.070\nRead it and click, I agree to it.\n\n619\n00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:10.790\nAnd it would just drop the signature in.\n\n620\n00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:12.320\nAnd that was it.\nDon't have to print anything out,\n\n621\n00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.160\ndon't have to make any photocopies,\nanything like that.\n\n622\n00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.310\nIt was just done.\n\n623\n00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.170\nIt was very, very quick and painless.\n\n624\n00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.713\n>> Wow.\n>> I could sign those documents and\n\n625\n00:34:20.713 --> 00:34:25.801\nI signed my whole documents maybe in,\nlike, less than ten minutes.\n\n626\n00:34:25.801 --> 00:34:27.327\nThat's all it took.\n>> Florida needs to catch up\n\n627\n00:34:27.327 --> 00:34:30.780\nwith California then,\nbecause I just bought a house recently and\n\n628\n00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.123\nI had to sign all those 800 pages myself.\n\n629\n00:34:33.123 --> 00:34:34.121\nFlorida needs to work on that.\n\n630\n00:34:34.121 --> 00:34:35.405\n[LAUGH]\n>> Did you have to stretch and everything?\n\n631\n00:34:35.405 --> 00:34:36.113\nAnd be like I'll be back.\n\n632\n00:34:36.113 --> 00:34:37.655\n>> I had to take a break halfway through.\n\n633\n00:34:37.655 --> 00:34:38.237\nI was like [SOUND].\n\n634\n00:34:38.237 --> 00:34:39.542\n>> Can we get pizza delivered or\nsomething?\n\n635\n00:34:39.542 --> 00:34:40.170\n>> Yeah.\n\n636\n00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:41.226\n>> This is taking a little too long.\n\n637\n00:34:41.226 --> 00:34:42.174\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But,\n\n638\n00:34:42.174 --> 00:34:44.480\nit is definitely considered\nlegally binding.\n\n639\n00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:50.240\nSo, if you have a digital signature,\nanywhere in the U.S.\n\n640\n00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.420\nyou digitally sign something it is\ndefinitely considered legally binding.\n\n641\n00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.582\nThey can hold you to it.\n\n642\n00:34:56.582 --> 00:35:01.409\nThere's a lot of places that are using\nthose systems now to let you digitally\n\n643\n00:35:01.409 --> 00:35:02.710\nsign paperwork.\n\n644\n00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.740\nI've seen it lots of times.\n\n645\n00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:10.240\nI just had a client that I worked\nwith not too long ago that they\n\n646\n00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:15.011\nscanned in the whatever,\nthe one for contractor use,\n\n647\n00:35:15.011 --> 00:35:17.800\nW-9 or W-2, whatever, tax form.\n\n648\n00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:23.960\nThey scanned it in and all I had to do was\njust in the boxes with my information.\n\n649\n00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.540\nAnd then when it came to sign it,\n\n650\n00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:30.520\nI just clicked on it and it said okay,\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign it.\n\n651\n00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.630\nAnd it even puts a little graphical\nrepresentation if you want\n\n652\n00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:35.350\nwhat your signature is.\n\n653\n00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:41.280\nAnd the way they do it is they bind that\ndigital signature to your email address.\n\n654\n00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.380\nThey identify you with a couple things,\ninitially you get the system, and\n\n655\n00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:47.680\nthen once they have that,\nthen boom, you're enrolled in it.\n\n656\n00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.180\nAnytime anyone sends you something to you,\n\n657\n00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:53.440\nthen sent it to the system,\nyou log in, and you're ready to go,\n\n658\n00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:58.460\nand it's really, really, really cool,\nit just speeds things up substantially.\n\n659\n00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.510\nAnd the usage is just growing.\n\n660\n00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:04.920\nAnd the fact that they can take\njust any type of documents,\n\n661\n00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.950\nemployment documents,\nloan documents, anything.\n\n662\n00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:11.810\nAnd throw them in the system and just set\nup an account for you, click, click click.\n\n663\n00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:16.630\nThe amount of paperwork it reduces,\neffort it reduces.\n\n664\n00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.430\nAnd then they still get all the benefit\nof it being legally binding is\n\n665\n00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:21.530\njust, it's great.\n\n666\n00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:25.490\nJames was asking out there in the chat\nrooms, with the digital signatures,\n\n667\n00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:31.290\nis there a chance they can be duplicated?\n\n668\n00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:33.520\nThey're foolproof, right?\n\n669\n00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:40.230\n>> Theoretically you could say yeah,\nyou could do some stuff but, the digital\n\n670\n00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:50.320\nsignatures are made with a combination\nof public key cryptography and hashing.\n\n671\n00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.870\nAs long as you're using a good\nhashing algorithm that's not\n\n672\n00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.770\nprone to any problems like collisions.\n\n673\n00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:58.241\nYeah, I opened it up for you.\n\n674\n00:36:58.241 --> 00:37:03.180\n[LAUGH] See, that it's not prone to stuff\nlike collisions and making duplicates.\n\n675\n00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:07.370\nThere's a very low chance\nof it being duplicated.\n\n676\n00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:10.700\nI just wouldn't even really\nconcern yourself with it too much.\n\n677\n00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.290\nI mean, it's a valid concern, but\n\n678\n00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:17.210\nyou gotta think about the fact that\nwhat I was saying before the break.\n\n679\n00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.790\nThat if I was to take a document,\nwhatever it is,\n\n680\n00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.720\nand I just erased a single\ndecimal point off of it.\n\n681\n00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:29.820\nIf that hashing algorithm is sampling\neverything off that document as input.\n\n682\n00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.260\nThen, and\nit's designed well on top of that.\n\n683\n00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.950\nIt shouldn't be any problem.\n\n684\n00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:38.690\nI mean remember we also have\na hashing algorithm just like our\n\n685\n00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:43.600\nother encryption algorithms\nundergo peer review and\n\n686\n00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.760\nscrutiny for seven years before they say,\nboom, put it on.\n\n687\n00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.800\nYou know we're gonna allow you to use it.\n\n688\n00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.740\nYou know, the one thing I can see it being\nduplicated would be stuff like Ben's\n\n689\n00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.780\nalluding to leaving a PC unlocked or-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n690\n00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.060\n>> Getting a keylog on your system,\n\n691\n00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.050\nsomeone intercepts your

and\n\n694\n00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.790\nnot prone to stuff like collisions\nlike we talked about before.\n\n695\n00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:11.460\nThen you're probably fine.\n\n696\n00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:16.180\nIn fact, Mike, you're gonna show the one\non Cain and Abel collisions, yeah.\n\n697\n00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.330\n>> Yeah, so we can take a peek here.\n\n698\n00:38:17.330 -->

chunks.\n\n700\n00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.760\nSo what I've got here,\nI've got Cain and Abel pulled up and\n\n701\n00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.740\nI'm just gonna put in,\nlet's just do

00:38:39.030\nI can't really zoom in on this guy.\n\n705\n00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.270\nThe LM is right here.\n\n706\n00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:41.340\n>> Can you go full screen on that?\n\n707\n00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.560\nIs that possible to do that?\n\n708\n00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.850\n>> If we can pull it and\nmake it just a hair bigger.\n\n709\n00:38:44.850 -->

there.\n\n738\n00:40:08.016 --> 00:40:10.566\nThat you're putting in different inputs.\n\n739\n00:40:10.566 --> 00:40:13.646\nAnd every other, if you were just\nkind of scanning down that list,\n\n740\n00:40:13.646 --> 00:40:16.134\n[CROSSTALK] you can see that\neverything else changed.\n\n741\n00:40:16.134 --> 00:40:17.809\n>> Watch the other ones.\nThey all changed.\n\n742\n00:40:17.809 --> 00:40:19.250\nAll these others are changing.\n\n743\n00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.080\nThis one is still the same.\n\n744\n00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:25.285\nSo in other

00:40:37.590\nstill generate the same hash value.\n\n750\n00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:42.310\nIf this was my password,\nthen I could type whatever I want.\n\n751\n00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.516\nAs long as I had the first\nseven characters right,\n\n752\n00:40:44.516 --> 00:40:47.471\nthe rest of it wouldn't matter and\nI can just authenticate as you.\n\n753\n00:40:47.471 --> 00:40:51.580\n>> Yeah, there's so\nmany levels of wrong with that.\n\n754\n00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:59.380\nThat's why you see that guidance and\ndo not use this, get it out of there.\n\n755\n00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.540\nDo whatever you have to but don't use\nthis because this is a very bad idea.\n\n756\n00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:04.710\nIt's breakable.\n\n757\n00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:09.520\nThis is why, when you went through CEH,\nthey had password crackers that\n\n758\n00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:14.110\nspecifically said if we find an LM hash\nin there, ignore all this other stuff,\n\n759\n00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:17.430\nI'm going after that one because I\nknow that one's easily breakable and\n\n760\n00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:20.940\nknow that one I can use\nto get into the system.\n\n761\n00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.490\nAnd once you've got that access then,\nhey, I'll reset the password or\n\n762\n00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:25.330\nwhatever I want.\n\n763\n00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:27.690\nI've got the access at that point.\n\n764\n00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:30.360\nSo, at the time they built this,\n\n765\n00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:35.090\nI even wanna say honestly when\nMicrosoft came out with this.\n\n766\n00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:36.460\nI wanna say, what?\n\n767\n00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.593\nThis was The Windows for Workgroups era\nstuff [CROSSTALK] right around there.\n\n768\n00:41:39.593 --> 00:41:41.440\n>> Yeah, it's still before, pre-2000.\n\n769\n00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.180\n>> Yeah, I know it's back a ways, and\neven at the time they created it,\n\n770\n00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:50.610\nI don't know how that\npassed muster right there.\n\n771\n00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:51.510\nI just can't see it.\n\n772\n00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:54.330\n>> We didn't use passwords, and\nif we did, it was like cat.\n\n773\n00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:54.855\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n774\n00:41:54.855 --> 00:41:57.650\n>> Yeah, it was stuff like that.\n\n775\n00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:00.480\n>> Who's gonna use a password\nlonger than seven characters?\n\n776\n00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.830\nThat's just crazy talk.\n\n777\n00:42:03.518 --> 00:42:07.950\n>> I just am still just kind of just look\nat it going, what you guys use that,\n\n778\n00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:11.270\nthat past review,\nwho thought that was a good idea?\n\n779\n00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.710\n>> This is probably one of those cases\nwhere to reference something that we\n\n780\n00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:15.780\ntalked about.\n\n781\n00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:21.640\nSomeone created an algorithm, no peer\nreview, no actual cryptographers or\n\n782\n00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.860\npeople that are experts on that involved,\nto pick this stuff out and tell them hey,\n\n783\n00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.550\nthat's a stupid idea what you're doing,\nknock it off and fix it.\n\n784\n00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:33.950\nThey just create their own and low and\nbehold, you have something that has very\n\n785\n00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:39.690\ndeficient and now days would be\na huge liability if you used it.\n\n786\n00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:40.640\n>> Yeah.\n\n787\n00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.020\nAnd the question in the chat room,\nbytes to hash is just another input, so\n\n788\n00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:47.790\nI could input some hex, I dunno, AC123 or\n\n789\n00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:52.194\nsomething like that, and I could calculate\nout the, invalid length of bytes.\n\n790\n00:42:52.194 --> 00:42:53.955\nIt's got some.\n\n791\n00:42:53.955 --> 00:42:57.090\nOh, I need a full byte, don't I.\n\n792\n00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:03.168\nSo if I do 1 There you go.\n\n793\n00:43:03.168 --> 00:43:08.000\nSo I that's just hashing the bits there,\nthe ones and the zeroes, and\n\n794\n00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.320\nto the question earlier, so here's another\nmore registry size versus collision.\n\n795\n00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.070\nI think it was the algorithm itself that\nthey were using, that said all right\n\n796\n00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:20.650\nhere comes their password, we're gonna\nhash it, but I'm just gonna take the first\n\n797\n00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:23.900\nseven characters, the rest of them I'm\ngonna ignore and just leave it out.\n\n798\n00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.400\nAnd that's what is stored.\n\n799\n00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.160\n>> Yeah, and they just really,\nin essence, used it twice.\n\n800\n00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.520\nThey made it so you have 14 characters,\nbut if you looked at behind the scenes it\n\n801\n00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.160\nwas really seven and\nseven is what it was doing.\n\n802\n00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.653\n>> So if you had an eight character\npassword you had seven characters hashed\n\n803\n00:43:38.653 --> 00:43:42.146\nand then you had a single character\nwhere some blank space is hashed, and\n\n804\n00:43:42.146 --> 00:43:44.795\nthat was where we could really\nstart breaking it down.\n\n805\n00:43:44.795 --> 00:43:49.050\n>> Yeah it was deficient\nall over the place.\n\n806\n00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:52.070\nThere was all sorts of little\ntechniques you could use to break it.\n\n807\n00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:56.240\nIf you used a password that was seven\ncharacters less, it was really easy\n\n808\n00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:00.840\nto see it with seven characters cuz all\nyou really had to do is just to test\n\n809\n00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.440\nthe system, hash something, use that same\nalgorithm, and try a three character\n\n810\n00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.270\npassword or four, or a five character\npassword, something that's seven or less.\n\n811\n00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:12.890\nAnd if half of that hash was still the\nsame as this other one you didn't know,\n\n812\n00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:15.890\nyou're looking at a password\nthat's seven characters or less.\n\n813\n00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:17.480\nYou just made your life a lot easier.\n\n814\n00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.366\n>> Cuz the last part of the hash\nwould be exactly the same.\n\n815\n00:44:19.366 --> 00:44:19.910\n>> Yeah.\n\n816\n00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:24.024\nYou hash blank spaces, period,\nit's always gonna be the same.\n\n817\n00:44:24.024 --> 00:44:24.920\n>> Exactly.\nWe can probably,\n\n818\n00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.220\nI wonder if it'll show you here.\n\n819\n00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.800\nIf I just do two characters.\n\n820\n00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:36.310\nSo the last part of that there is\none two six echo one four zero.\n\n821\n00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:38.750\nIf I do two different characters.\n\n822\n00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:39.550\n>> I'm not sure that will do it.\n\n823\n00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:41.050\n>> I don't think this is going to cut it.\n\n824\n00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:42.820\n>> Because I think it is only\noperating in seven character level.\n\n825\n00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.119\n>> Yeah, it is, yep.\n\n826\n00:44:44.119 --> 00:44:49.526\n>> Yeah, so it's a mess but I think\nyou guys get the point on that one,\n\n827\n00:44:49.526 --> 00:44:56.095\nyou can look up, there's other screw ups\nthat Microsoft did to limit the input on\n\n828\n00:44:56.095 --> 00:45:00.430\nthis, only upper case letters, there was-\n>> That's right,\n\n829\n00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:01.700\nit removed case from it too.\n\n830\n00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.900\n>> Yeah.\n>> That was just crazy.\n\n831\n00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.720\n>> Yeah, it cut your options in half and\n\n832\n00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:10.820\nthen there was other limitations on it\nas far as length of the password and\n\n833\n00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:15.370\njust handling of inside,\nit was a disaster, it really was.\n\n834\n00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:20.285\nThat's why I look at it and say,\nno one thought that was serious, right?\n\n835\n00:45:20.285 --> 00:45:22.245\nYeah.\nSomeone had to come in, and\n\n836\n00:45:22.245 --> 00:45:24.885\ndid a little drinky or\nsomething like yeah, we're done.\n\n837\n00:45:24.885 --> 00:45:27.525\n>> We're just all logged on with\na built-in admin account, anyway.\n\n838\n00:45:27.525 --> 00:45:28.920\nRight?\nIt didn't really matter.\n\n839\n00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.565\n[LAUGH]\n>> They came\n\n840\n00:45:29.565 --> 00:45:33.317\nin drinking out of their bucket and\nsaid what are you doing?\n\n841\n00:45:33.317 --> 00:45:34.433\n>> Straight back from Ireland.\n\n842\n00:45:34.433 --> 00:45:35.411\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n843\n00:45:35.411 --> 00:45:40.427\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so we've got some\nother applications where we see hashing.\n\n844\n00:45:40.427 --> 00:45:44.787\nWe talked about digital certificates,\ndigital signatures, IPsec.\n\n845\n00:45:44.787 --> 00:45:46.673\n>> Right, used in IPsec.\n\n846\n00:45:46.673 --> 00:45:51.013\nVerify the integrity of those packets,\nwith IPsec you can choose confidentiality,\n\n847\n00:45:51.013 --> 00:45:54.683\nintegrity or both, integrity is\ngoing to be done with hashing.\n\n848\n00:45:54.683 --> 00:45:58.683\n>> Yeah it can be integrity and digital\nsigning, it has the option to do all that\n\n849\n00:45:58.683 --> 00:46:05.333\nso we've got very much\ninvested in that technology so\n\n850\n00:46:05.333 --> 00:46:09.550\njust another one, and\nthen I've got the email ones in there too.\n\n851\n00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:13.910\nI mean, that's a very, very common one.\n\n852\n00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:19.890\nI mean, heck, one that I always think\nof is, those of you that are SIPS,\n\n853\n00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:25.020\nuse the SSPs,\nISC sends out their emails with their\n\n854\n00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:30.640\nhashing algorithm ,on it saying we\nhashed it to show you that it's legit.\n\n855\n00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.400\nBut you can also use,\n\n856\n00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.160\nin the context, to verify an email in\nthe context of the digital signature, too.\n\n857\n00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.910\nBut I think you can do it by itself and\n\n858\n00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:41.535\nsome of these do it because they don't\ncare about the authenticity as much as\n\n859\n00:46:41.535 --> 00:46:46.875\nthey care about making sure you\nget what they want you to have.\n\n860\n00:46:46.875 --> 00:46:49.455\n>> Yeah and it's a great example\nof combining a couple of different\n\n861\n00:46:49.455 --> 00:46:52.025\nthings to give us the different\nlegs of our CIA triad.\n\n862\n00:46:52.025 --> 00:46:55.715\nRight, If when we apply in Outlook or\nsome of these other programs,\n\n863\n00:46:55.715 --> 00:47:01.290\nwhen you apply a digital signature to an\nemail you're basically hashing the email.\n\n864\n00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:06.770\nGenerating a MD, or message digest,\nattaching that to the email,\n\n865\n00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:11.390\nand then encrypting that hash value, or\nthat message digest with your private key.\n\n866\n00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:13.080\nThat gets sent to somebody.\n\n867\n00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.670\nIf they can use your public\nkey to decrypt the hash value,\n\n868\n00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:19.380\nthen it had to be encrypted with\nyour private key in the first place.\n\n869\n00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.330\nSo now I've got non refutation.\n\n870\n00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:22.610\nNow I've got the hash value.\n\n871\n00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:25.710\nI can run the email through\nthe hashing algorithm.\n\n872\n00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:29.030\nIf I generate the exact\nsame hash value as you,\n\n873\n00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:31.940\nthen I know that the email\nitself hasn't been modified.\n\n874\n00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.130\nSo I've got the integrity.\n\n875\n00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.410\nSo I'm getting non refutation.\n\n876\n00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:35.690\nI'm getting integrity.\n\n877\n00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:38.525\nThat is a combination of\nasymmetric encryption and\n\n878\n00:47:38.525 --> 00:47:39.999\nhashing at work at its finest.\n\n879\n00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:42.140\nForensics.\n\n880\n00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:43.560\nWe've talked about this.\n\n881\n00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.200\nIf you haven't watched those digital\nforensic investigator shows,\n\n882\n00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.570\ngo back and watch them.\n\n883\n00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:51.990\nBut it ties into there as well, I think\nyou've already mentioned that once.\n\n884\n00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:53.971\n>> Yeah, it's very much in forensics.\n\n885\n00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:59.457\nWe've mentioned that, over the prior\ntwo weeks, I don't think there\n\n886\n00:47:59.457 --> 00:48:04.774\nwas a day we actually didn't mention\nhashing at least a dozen times.\n\n887\n00:48:04.774 --> 00:48:08.562\nBecause it was just so\nintegral to everything you do over there.\n\n888\n00:48:08.562 --> 00:48:15.320\nEvery tool we used seemed, in some way,\nshape, or form, to do hashing.\n\n889\n00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:20.610\nWithout hashing,\nthat process of doing digital forensics\n\n890\n00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:23.970\non that computer becomes\ntremendously difficult.\n\n891\n00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:25.930\nYou can still do it, but\n\n892\n00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:28.650\nit's a matter of evidence-\n>> How do I prove that I haven't modified\n\n893\n00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:29.150\nthe evidence?\n\n894\n00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:30.920\n>> Yeah.\n>> The defense attorney's gonna say my guy\n\n895\n00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.060\ndidn't do that, you did that during\nthe course of your investigation.\n\n896\n00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.390\n>> Yeah, that's exactly it.\n\n897\n00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:42.240\nIs that you get this big problem\nnow is that you have to verify that\n\n898\n00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:48.700\ninformation is the same thing as it was\nwhen you collected it at the scene.\n\n899\n00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:52.060\nYou have to show that\npreservation actually took place.\n\n900\n00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.710\nIt's a big, big, big problem.\n\n901\n00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:56.800\nWithout it, what are you gonna do?\n\n902\n00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.280\nHow are you gonna prove that a log\nfile isn't here say anymore?\n\n903\n00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:01.760\n>> Right.\n>> How are you gonna prove that image\n\n904\n00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.950\nthat you created didn't get corrupted or\naltered?\n\n905\n00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:07.793\nOr you didn't plant something,\nyou could do it but\n\n906\n00:49:07.793 --> 00:49:11.240\nit becomes substantially more difficult.\n\n907\n00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.420\nSo computer forensics\nas it stand right now\n\n908\n00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:20.302\nwould be a whole different world\nwithout introduction of hashing.\n\n909\n00:49:20.302 --> 00:49:21.070\nAll right.\n\n910\n00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:23.630\n>> And passwords, we've mentioned\nthat a couple of times already,\n\n911\n00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:26.580\nI mean that's how our passwords\nare stored as well as\n\n912\n00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.720\nhow they're transmitted over the network,\nright?\n\n913\n00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.000\n>> Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n914\n00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.410\nYou look at the things like CHAP and\nthose protocols, they send hashes.\n\n915\n00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:39.830\nThey don't send the actual password.\n\n916\n00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:42.440\nYou type in a password on your system,\nand it hashes it and\n\n917\n00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.520\nbeams out the hash across the wire.\n\n918\n00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.640\nAnd then that's compared to\nsomething on the other side.\n\n919\n00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:52.500\nSo it's to prevent someone from\nintercepting you know your password.\n\n920\n00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:56.100\n>> When you generate a password,\nlike in active directory for example,\n\n921\n00:49:56.100 --> 00:50:00.380\nthat password is hashed and\nstored in the active directory database.\n\n922\n00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:04.610\nWhen you go to log into a system, it's not\nsending your password across the network.\n\n923\n00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:08.520\nIt's hashing what you've typed in and\nsending that over, and\n\n924\n00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.610\nit's comparing the hash values, the one\nit's got stored in the database and\n\n925\n00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:12.720\nthe one that just got submitted.\n\n926\n00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:17.250\nIf those match, then the same input\nhad to be used to generate them, so\n\n927\n00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:20.150\nthat means you must have typed\nin the right password, or\n\n928\n00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:23.100\nthat's the assumption\nthat it's making there.\n\n929\n00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.496\nIntrusion detection,\nthat comes into play here as well.\n\n930\n00:50:25.496 --> 00:50:29.380\n>> Yeah, both host and\n\n931\n00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:33.460\nnetwork intrusion detection would\ndefinitely be using this technology.\n\n932\n00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:36.960\nNetwork base because\na signature databases and\n\n933\n00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:41.630\npatterns of known attacks it can\nuse this to verify it on the host.\n\n934\n00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:45.990\nTripwire was a really good example,\nTripwire hashes critical system files, or\n\n935\n00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:48.106\nany system files period you specify and\n\n936\n00:50:48.106 --> 00:50:51.712\nif there's a difference it will\ntell you hey this one's changed.\n\n937\n00:50:51.712 --> 00:50:56.310\nIt won't tell you why it's changed,\nit just tells you that it did change.\n\n938\n00:50:56.310 --> 00:51:00.750\nIn fact, I find, whenever I think\nof stuff like a host base and\n\n939\n00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:04.540\ntalk about hashing it reminds\nme of this little thing.\n\n940\n00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.780\nYou guys can look this up.\n\n941\n00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:10.150\nIt's just kind of a little\ninteresting piece of\n\n942\n00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:13.790\ntrivia of the lengths people\nwill go to to find stuff out.\n\n943\n00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:15.680\nThey had a game.\n\n944\n00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:20.290\nSome of you may remember a game they\nhad just a short handful of years ago\n\n945\n00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:21.870\ncalled Portal.\n\n946\n00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:26.340\nThey came out with Portal 2 only about\nmaybe three years ago, I want to say.\n\n947\n00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:30.930\nWell Portal was still chugging along,\nit was still a popular game,\n\n948\n00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:34.360\npeople were playing it online and\ndoing stuff like that.\n\n949\n00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.870\nWell, along the way,\nValve released an update for\n\n950\n00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:41.320\nit because what they were doing was\nthey were adding a few things to it.\n\n951\n00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:46.530\nAnd those things they added\nto it were designed to let\n\n952\n00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:50.500\npeople know in the context of that game\nthat there was a new one coming out.\n\n953\n00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.770\nIt's a really unique way,\ncuz you're immersed in this environment.\n\n954\n00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:56.030\nYou hear stuff from the radio that weird\nstuff would happen and things like that,\n\n955\n00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:57.480\nlike what's going on?\n\n956\n00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.920\nAnd so people start thinking,\n\n957\n00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.140\nhey, this might have something to\ndo with a new game coming out.\n\n958\n00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:06.870\nSo, instead of people waiting for\na more formal announcement,\n\n959\n00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:08.840\ninstead of just the in game stuff.\n\n960\n00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:13.840\nThey actually went into the game\nFolder and pulled out hashes\n\n961\n00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.010\nout of stuff that had been updated\nduring that process and found what\n\n962\n00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:21.930\nfiles had been updated between the one\nthat they had before and the one after.\n\n963\n00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:24.280\nAnd then targeted those files and\nlooked for\n\n964\n00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.945\nthings that had been updated\nto recover what was in there.\n\n965\n00:52:26.945 --> 00:52:28.645\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> So they needed the secrets to the game?\n\n966\n00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:29.550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n967\n00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:32.130\nthey no longer had to play\nto find these secrets.\n\n968\n00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:34.570\nThey're finding little things there.\n\n969\n00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:39.465\nBut the company seemed to be aware that\npeople were gonna do that because they hid\n\n970\n00:52:39.465 --> 00:52:44.225\nlittle things here and\nthere that, if you dug in,\n\n971\n00:52:44.225 --> 00:52:47.715\nthe only way you're ever gonna find those\nthings was by doing something like this.\n\n972\n00:52:47.715 --> 00:52:51.455\nSo it was just amazing how people\nbanded together and did this and.\n\n973\n00:52:51.455 --> 00:52:52.652\n>> Right.\n>> They just\n\n974\n00:52:52.652 --> 00:52:54.180\nhad some fascinating ways they did it.\n\n975\n00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.452\n[LAUGH] It was just a really crazy thing.\n\n976\n00:52:56.452 --> 00:52:58.402\nThey had stuff in game,\nand stuff out of game.\n\n977\n00:52:58.402 --> 00:52:59.972\n>> Nice.\n>> They had people exchanging stuff in\n\n978\n00:52:59.972 --> 00:53:02.342\ndiscussion groups all\nover the world on it.\n\n979\n00:53:02.342 --> 00:53:04.502\nThey even, if you can believe it,\n\n980\n00:53:04.502 --> 00:53:08.972\nwhen they did that, they actually had some\nstuff that was encrypted in there that\n\n981\n00:53:09.982 --> 00:53:12.322\nwhen you went through and\nknew the algorithm for it.\n\n982\n00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:15.960\nIt was some of the old encoding\nstuff that they used for modems.\n\n983\n00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.650\nWhich old first generation dial up modems.\n\n984\n00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:20.760\nAnd so people said,\noh I think that's what that is.\n\n985\n00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.710\nAnd they did it and\nthere was an image that came out like off\n\n986\n00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:27.960\nof a blurry image off of a security\ncamera or something of something in game.\n\n987\n00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.060\nAnd people were going,\nwow there's like a whole story there,\n\n988\n00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.060\nstuff that's being hidden.\n\n989\n00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:33.110\n>> Wow.\n>> And messages written by people.\n\n990\n00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:34.100\n>> Is it like-\n>> About the characters.\n\n991\n00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.690\n>> Not just Easter egg, but\nan entire Easter egg basket here.\n\n992\n00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:37.281\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n993\n00:53:37.281 --> 00:53:39.818\n[LAUGH]\n>> They did a lot on it, but it was just,\n\n994\n00:53:39.818 --> 00:53:42.779\nto me, just the way it kicked\noff by people saying, hey,\n\n995\n00:53:42.779 --> 00:53:44.530\nthere's some hashes over here.\n\n996\n00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:47.220\nIf you do this and this,\nwe compare the two,\n\n997\n00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:51.640\nwe can just hunt down those files directly\nand just start extracting stuff from those\n\n998\n00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:55.460\nand it was like a Manhattan Project\nlevel [LAUGH] type thing.\n\n999\n00:53:55.460 --> 00:54:00.440\nYou saw people in a case of like two days,\nall over the world,\n\n1000\n00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.190\nexchanging information and working on it.\n\n1001\n00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:03.560\nIt was like moving to\ndifferent time zones,\n\n1002\n00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:04.990\nyou could see it move around the world.\n\n1003\n00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:10.440\nAnd people were solving stuff and found\nall these, a lot of these little secrets.\n\n1004\n00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:14.140\nThe lengths that people will go to,\nI mean it's just a game.\n\n1005\n00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:17.390\nYou can imagine If someone's\ngonna do that for a game, what\n\n1006\n00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:21.451\nare they gonna do if it's something that\nthey really, really makes a difference.\n\n1007\n00:54:21.451 --> 00:54:22.900\n>> Yeah.\n>> They're gonna do it,\n\n1008\n00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.860\nso that's another little\nkinda warning to that story.\n\n1009\n00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.580\nAside from all the fun and games.\n\n1010\n00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:29.630\n>> We had a question there.\n\n1011\n00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:34.480\nBen was asking if someone can get to\nthe message or a download page, can't they\n\n1012\n00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.890\nrehash it, still look as safe and the good\nthing about the way they're doing that.\n\n1013\n00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:40.830\nA lot of these, when you look at\nLinux distros and things like that,\n\n1014\n00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:46.360\nthey'll publish the download link and\nthen an MD5 or an SHA1 value or something\n\n1015\n00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:50.830\nlike that, and what it is though is the\nlink typically goes to a mirrored site.\n\n1016\n00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:53.830\nAll right so\nthey're not hosting the actual ISO.\n\n1017\n00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:57.870\nThey're giving you a link to a mirrored\nsite where you're getting that ISO from.\n\n1018\n00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:00.910\nThe MD5 value is hosted on their site.\n\n1019\n00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:02.290\nAnd that's what they're\ndoing to protect you.\n\n1020\n00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:05.580\nThey don't want that mirrored site because\nthey're not in control of that content.\n\n1021\n00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.950\nSo what if that mirrored site was\nputting some malware into that ISO or\n\n1022\n00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:11.220\ndoing something bad like that.\n\n1023\n00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.040\nYou download that ISO.\n\n1024\n00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.410\nYou get the hash value from\ndistrowatch.org for example.\n\n1025\n00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:19.610\nYou run it through your\nown hashing algorithm.\n\n1026\n00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:22.070\nThe same hashing algorithm\ncompare values and\n\n1027\n00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:25.620\nthat's how you can verify that\nthat ISO had not been modified,\n\n1028\n00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:29.100\nor it's the same one that they\nintended you to download.\n\n1029\n00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:34.220\nIf the ISO and the hash value\nwere on the same web server, and\n\n1030\n00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:38.450\nyou had access to modify the ISO\nas well as modify the MP5,\n\n1031\n00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:42.340\nthen absolutely you could not\ntell that that had been modified.\n\n1032\n00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:45.420\nBut again the hash value of you doing\nwhat you're supposed to do, right?\n\n1033\n00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:49.800\nYou download the modified ISO, but\nthe hash value matches the ISO,\n\n1034\n00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.430\nso you're not comparing\nthe same thing there.\n\n1035\n00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:54.460\n>> Yeah that's why it shows to be careful.\n\n1036\n00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:57.665\nIf you're going to grab something,\ngrab it from,\n\n1037\n00:55:57.665 --> 00:56:02.071\nif it's just the hash even make sure\nyou grab it from a trusted source.\n\n1038\n00:56:02.071 --> 00:56:06.896\nI would never just go to a random site and\ngo, oh that hash looks good or\n\n1039\n00:56:06.896 --> 00:56:09.575\nthere's a hash there, must be good.\n\n1040\n00:56:09.575 --> 00:56:12.030\nJust because it's there,\nit doesn't mean anything.\n\n1041\n00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:15.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like I need to see a little bit\n\n1042\n00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:17.780\nmore, usually a form of ID.\n\n1043\n00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:20.790\nSomething that's tells me\nthat you're a trusted source,\n\n1044\n00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:21.830\nsomeone I should be going to.\n\n1045\n00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:23.650\nI'm not gonna take your word for it.\n\n1046\n00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:25.200\nIt's like me coming up to you,\nyou don't know me.\n\n1047\n00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.460\nIf you hadn't seen me in these things,\nand I just walked up on the street and\n\n1048\n00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:31.920\nshook your hand, and says, oh hey\nI'm Sean, you're taking my word for it.\n\n1049\n00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.060\nI could be whoever.\n\n1050\n00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:38.440\nSo you wanna have something that gives\nyou that nice warm fuzzy feeling.\n\n1051\n00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.270\nSo I would go to the site.\n\n1052\n00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:44.590\nLike I said, get it from anywhere,\nand the hash will still check out.\n\n1053\n00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:45.190\n>> Should check out.\n\n1054\n00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:46.200\nExactly.\n\n1055\n00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.700\nAnd then searches within the database,\nwe've mentioned that earlier as well, and\n\n1056\n00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:50.990\nother places hashes are used.\n\n1057\n00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:56.093\n>> Yeah, they use hashes in\ndatabases cuz what they'll do is,\n\n1058\n00:56:56.093 --> 00:57:02.610\nsince a hash is gonna be unique, as we\nsaid, for anything that comes into it.\n\n1059\n00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:06.158\nWe can hash different records in\na database and we can very quickly,\n\n1060\n00:57:06.158 --> 00:57:10.142\nby typing in the search or look for\nsomething, it can very quickly hash it and\n\n1061\n00:57:10.142 --> 00:57:13.460\ncompare it to a list of hashes and\nthen boom, find your record.\n\n1062\n00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:17.390\nIt's a very quick way of indexing and\nsearching within a database.\n\n1063\n00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:21.170\nThey may not hash everything but\nthey may hash things like critical fields.\n\n1064\n00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:23.340\nTo make it much much easier.\n\n1065\n00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:28.220\nWe've kinda, sorta seen that already,\nwhen we were in the CEH,\n\n1066\n00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:32.590\na lot of you may remember rainbow tables.\n\n1067\n00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:35.174\n>> Right.\n>> Rainbow tables,\n\n1068\n00:57:35.174 --> 00:57:40.040\nwe pregenerated a whole bunch of hashes,\nand we found that once you generate all\n\n1069\n00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:45.500\nthose hashes, you could very,\nvery quickly and easily just search them.\n\n1070\n00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:49.760\nI mean, Windows can do that just by taking\na copy of the hash you wanna search on, or\n\n1071\n00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:53.620\nstring you want to search on, drop it in\nthe search bar and then hit it, and boom.\n\n1072\n00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:56.520\nIt'll come back within a very short time.\n\n1073\n00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.490\n>> Take advantage of those collisions.\n\n1074\n00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:59.950\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1075\n00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:01.710\n>> And to round this one off,\n\n1076\n00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:04.600\nwe wanna mention some of the different\ntypes of hashing algorithms.\n\n1077\n00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.980\nThey all pretty much do the same thing,\n\n1078\n00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.646\ndifferent formulas in the background\nunder the hood, right.\n\n1079\n00:58:09.646 --> 00:58:11.600\nDifferent output lengths.\n\n1080\n00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.707\n>> Yeah,\nthat's really it we don't have keys for\n\n1081\n00:58:14.707 --> 00:58:19.989\nexample in the same way we do in the other\none so you're not gonna see key lengths,\n\n1082\n00:58:19.989 --> 00:58:23.660\nbut you will see different\nhash lengths come into play.\n\n1083\n00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:30.110\nAnd so you see stuff like the MD family of\nhash algorithms, like MD 2, 4, 5 and 6.\n\n1084\n00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:31.957\n>> In fact, yeah,\nif we can pull up my screen one more time,\n\n1085\n00:58:31.957 --> 00:58:34.120\nwe'll just take a look at that\nwebpage we were looking at earlier.\n\n1086\n00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:38.245\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n>> And you can see, like SHA1 was 128,\n\n1087\n00:58:38.245 --> 00:58:41.820\n224, 256, 384, 512.\n\n1088\n00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:44.360\nThose are the bit lengths\nof the output value.\n\n1089\n00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:44.950\nAll right?\n\n1090\n00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:48.740\n>> Yeah, it's the same,\nessentially the same basic algorithm.\n\n1091\n00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:53.810\nThey just have done tweaks to it\nto give it a longer output on it.\n\n1092\n00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:56.660\nBut we've got plenty of them there.\n\n1093\n00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:57.650\nThere's a bunch of ones.\n\n1094\n00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:58.660\nYou see the Tiger, and\n\n1095\n00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:02.860\nthere's Havuss, I see Ripe on there,\nthose are the ones I have on my list.\n\n1096\n00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:04.110\nThere's different.-\n>> Snefru?\n\n1097\n00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:05.197\nI haven't heard of that one.\n\n1098\n00:59:05.197 --> 00:59:06.197\n>> Snefru?\n\n1099\n00:59:06.197 --> 00:59:09.865\n>> Snefru and Snefru 2, or 256.\n\n1100\n00:59:09.865 --> 00:59:10.685\nThat's interesting.\n\n1101\n00:59:10.685 --> 00:59:14.674\n>> I feel like a nerd cuz\nI know who Snefru is.\n\n1102\n00:59:14.674 --> 00:59:15.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1103\n00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.905\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a pharaoh in Egypt.\n\n1104\n00:59:17.905 --> 00:59:18.860\nHe was.\n\n1105\n00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.570\n>> Oh, I thought it was the cat on He Man.\n\n1106\n00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:21.450\nWait.\n\n1107\n00:59:21.450 --> 00:59:27.290\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you showed your nerd cred there.\n\n1108\n00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:29.248\n>> Right.\nSo.- [LAUGH]\n\n1109\n00:59:29.248 --> 00:59:31.360\n>> If we had many different ones,\n\n1110\n00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:34.120\nyou know, NV4, NV5, NV6.\n\n1111\n00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:37.735\n>> Yeah, notice by the way,\nthe page you had up there.\n\n1112\n00:59:37.735 --> 00:59:40.030\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> It went up to MD5 but\n\n1113\n00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:41.490\nthere was no MD6 on there.\n\n1114\n00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:43.500\n>> There wasn't an MD6 on here, correct.\n\n1115\n00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.450\n>> Yeah, that's a good example.\n\n1116\n00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:47.323\nMD6 came out and was,\n\n1117\n00:59:47.323 --> 00:59:52.950\nit's actually would be considered\nstronger and robust than MD5.\n\n1118\n00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:55.900\nThey just said, hey there's\nreally no reason for us to do it.\n\n1119\n00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:59.080\nMP5 isn't really causing any problems.\n\n1120\n00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:03.080\nI know we were mentioning\nthat during this course\n\n1121\n01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:07.030\nalready that MD5 had some issues.-\n>> [CROSSTALK].\n\n1122\n01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:09.019\n>> Yeah there were some issues with it.\n\n1123\n01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.200\nBut they weren't that big of a deal.\n\n1124\n01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.070\nThey're still using it.\n\n1125\n01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:16.240\nThose issues were found\nlike ten years ago.\n\n1126\n01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:22.020\nThat's enough time to phase a hash\nalgorithm out if you really want to do it.\n\n1127\n01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:25.240\nIt's a big problem that\nwas causing big issues.\n\n1128\n01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:29.530\nThey just would've over night gone\nto the Shaw family of algorithms.\n\n1129\n01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:31.220\nThey didn't do that.\n\n1130\n01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:35.080\nSo when MD6 came out,\nit's a brand spanking new, shiny,\n\n1131\n01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.450\nnew algorithm, they really haven't\npulled it out of production.\n\n1132\n01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:42.730\nSo you'll still see it there.\n\n1133\n01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:43.760\n>> All right.\n\n1134\n01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.790\nWell a lot of good information there,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n1135\n01:00:45.790 --> 01:00:49.670\nWe went through all kinds of, we talked\na lot about hashing and message digest.\n\n1136\n01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:54.080\nAll the way from what the heck hashing is,\nto how it's working.\n\n1137\n01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.379\nNot necessarily the under the hood,\nas Sean likes to say, view of it, but\n\n1138\n01:00:57.379 --> 01:00:58.240\nwhat it's doing.\n\n1139\n01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.890\nIt's turning that data into\nsome type of message digest,\n\n1140\n01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:03.400\nfixed length output, right?\n\n1141\n01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.520\nWe took a look at some of the different\nplaces that these hashing algorithms\n\n1142\n01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.020\nare used, as well as some different types.\n\n1143\n01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.280\nWe showed you a good list of all\nthe different algorithms, and\n\n1144\n01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.160\nthat wasn't a finite list.\n\n1145\n01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:16.840\nThat just happened to be the ones that,\nthat particular little web app supported.\n\n1146\n01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.450\nBut there are others,\nMD6 wasn't even in the list.\n\n1147\n01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:20.150\n>> Yeah.\n\n1148\n01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:23.350\n>> So any other tidbits we want to throw\nin here before we wrap this one up?\n\n1149\n01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:28.590\n>> Just saying,\nsince we're keeping score here.\n\n1150\n01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:32.780\nRemember that we've got\nthe difference between hashing and\n\n1151\n01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:35.620\nour other encryption protocols,\n\n1152\n01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:39.640\nthe ones we have in our prior episodes and\nhashing, they're not the same.\n\n1153\n01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.730\nRemember, it's one way.\n\n1154\n01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:43.550\nRemember some of the mechanics of it, and\n\n1155\n01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:46.650\nwhy it's significant to\nuse this over the others.\n\n1156\n01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:50.370\nThose are the big ones, those are the ones\nthat people do get caught on.\n\n1157\n01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:53.830\nWhat's the output, or\nwhat's the goal of doing hashing?\n\n1158\n01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:58.040\nYou can remember those ones, I could\nreally care less, at least for here.\n\n1159\n01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.480\nI'm not testing you on it,\nno one's testing you on this, for this.\n\n1160\n01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.900\nBut, it doesn't matter,\n\n1161\n01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.080\nas long as you know what a hashing\nalgorithm's supposed to do.\n\n1162\n01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:12.440\nLike I've told students in my\nclasses when you talk about IPSEC,\n\n1163\n01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:17.480\nI tell them before I even get to IPSEC for\nstuff like CEH, specifically.\n\n1164\n01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.960\nI'll tell them, when I'm going\nthrough some of that I'll say,\n\n1165\n01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:25.200\nwell when you know what these\nalgorithms do, encryption,\n\n1166\n01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.360\ndecryption, understand what these are and\nhow to lay these out.\n\n1167\n01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.900\nBecause when we go down the road and\ntalk about IPsec,\n\n1168\n01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:35.920\nIPsec will say I'm going to use Sha,\nMD5 or Triple Des or something like that.\n\n1169\n01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.030\nYou don't even have to know\nspecifically how they're using it.\n\n1170\n01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:41.220\nOnce you know what those do,\nyou know some things,\n\n1171\n01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:44.430\nthe possibilities get really\nlimited on what it can be doing.\n\n1172\n01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:45.810\nSo there you go.\n\n1173\n01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:46.760\n>> Okay, good.\n\n1174\n01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.430\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe wanna thank everybody for tuning in,\n\n1175\n01:02:49.430

00:00:37.630\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.154\nI'm Mike Rodrick and with me today\nis the infamous Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:41.154 --> 00:00:41.919\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:44.060\n>> I am doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.330\n>> I'm doing fantastic,\n\n8\n00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.240\nbecause we've got another episode\nof our cryptography going on today.\n\n9\n00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.350\nAnd in this one, we're gonna take a look\nat code breaking and cryptanalysis.\n\n10\n00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.330\nOr cryptanalysis and code breaking, or\nwhichever way you wanna look at it.\n\n11\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.380\nSo lots of fun stuff ready to dive in.\n\n12\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.540\nAnd let's start Sean, with defining\nthat big nasty word, cryptanalysis.\n\n13\n00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.060\nWhat the heck am I trying to say there?\n\n14\n00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.178\n>> It sounds like something you\nneed to get insurance approval for.\n\n15\n00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:12.520\n>> [LAUGH] Right,\nit's a preexisting condition.\n\n16\n00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.191\n>> Yeah, we don't cover that,\nit's a preexisting, and we do cover,\n\n17\n00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:21.471\nit's gonna be a camera about this big and\nyou figure out where.\n\n18\n00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:23.236\nAll right, I'm hearing moans back there.\n\n19\n00:01:23.236 --> 00:01:28.060\n>> Or in cryptanalysis we do, it's\nlike the new version of grave robbers?\n\n20\n00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.665\nI don't know.\n\n21\n00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:32.915\n>> [LAUGH] Hey, I like it,\nwe should go with that.\n\n22\n00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:34.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cryptanalysis,\n\n23\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.710\nit's a part of the cryptographic field.\n\n24\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.360\nAnd what it is, is something that deals\nwith the development, analysis of course,\n\n25\n00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.080\ndissecting, and\nbreaking of cryptographic systems.\n\n26\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.830\nSo all of those things need to be done.\n\n27\n00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.280\nAnd all we've really been talking about at\nthis point, is the actual algorithms and\n\n28\n00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.430\nhow they work, how they're used,\nsignificance, and all that.\n\n29\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.630\nSo this is getting in really kinda on\nthe back end of things, for the most part.\n\n30\n00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.520\nYeah, they do develop new systems,\nbut they're analyzing existing and\n\n31\n00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.590\nbreaking existing.\n\n32\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.360\n>> So these are guys that\nare opening the hood and\n\n33\n00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.510\nlooking under the hood at these codes and\nwhat's going on within the ciphers itself.\n\n34\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.257\n>> Yeah, so that's really it.\n\n35\n00:02:13.257 --> 00:02:16.020\nThey're trying to figure\nout what makes things tick.\n\n36\n00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.740\nAnd you can imagine, it's a very,\nvery serious and intensive process to do.\n\n37\n00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.760\nAnd it's had a major\nimpact over the years.\n\n38\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.133\nSo what we're gonna do,\nis we're gonna talk about,\n\n39\n00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:33.738\nin here we're gonna talk about just some\nof the places where it's played a role.\n\n40\n00:02:33.738 --> 00:02:38.626\nBut we're gonna talk about just some\nof the techniques that make it work\n\n41\n00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:42.209\nwithout getting into all the math and\nstuff really,\n\n42\n00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.770\nreally underneath the hood, cuz it\ncan get really serious, pretty quick.\n\n43\n00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.520\nIn fact I, for\n\n44\n00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.780\njust to lead things off here,\nI put up on my screen here, just a quick\n\n45\n00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.310\nthing to kind of put you in the frame of\nmind that some people have issues with.\n\n46\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.960\nThis is what most people when\nthey look at code breaking,\n\n47\n00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.020\nthat's what's gonna be\nthe look on your face.\n\n48\n00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.660\nThey're like, oh,\nit's some kind of elvish.\n\n49\n00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.100\nYeah, that's about as\nclose as we are gonna get.\n\n50\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.200\nI dont even know what that\nstuff at the top means.\n\n51\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.520\nSo that's why we're not getting into it.\n\n52\n00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.540\nSo, anyway, just a quick thing to\nget you in the right frame of mind.\n\n53\n00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.970\n>> Right, it can really be,\nwell it is, another language.\n\n54\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.620\nAnd this cryptanalysis is not just for\nbreaking codes, right?\n\n55\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.610\nThat is what we think of it.\n\n56\n00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.020\nA lot of times it's the people who sit\ndown to try and break the codes so\n\n57\n00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.290\nwe can figure out what somebody is\nsending via this encrypted text.\n\n58\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.450\nBut it's also done in places where I just\nneed to analyze the algorithm itself.\n\n59\n00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.140\nLike what, the other day,\nwe solved for True Crypt lately, and\n\n60\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.280\nit hasn't been a big one in the news\nwhere they're, nobody really understood,\n\n61\n00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.420\nor knew where it came from so\n\n62\n00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.660\nwe need to analyze it to see if there's\nany vulnerabilities or weaknesses.\n\n63\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.520\nSo cryptanalysis is not\njust breaking code, right?\n\n64\n00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.900\n>> Yeah, it's definitely not,\nthat's only a small part of it.\n\n65\n00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.560\nSo when we titled this episode,\n\n66\n00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.450\njust like I did in the book,\nCryptanalysis and Code-Breaking.\n\n67\n00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.530\nBut don't get stuck on the fact\nthat it's just code-breaking.\n\n68\n00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.320\nA lot of what we're dealing with here\nis gonna be on the code-breaking and\n\n69\n00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.490\ndissecting of algorithms part and\nhow that's done, but\n\n70\n00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.830\nit's definitely not the only part.\n\n71\n00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.770\nThere's people that are hard at work\nat this, developing new ones, and\n\n72\n00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.710\npulling apart existing ones,\nto see how they could tweak it, or\n\n73\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.140\nwhere there might be problems.\n\n74\n00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.099\n>> Or peer review might follow there.\n\n75\n00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:27.901\n>> Or peer review.\n\n76\n00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:28.910\nThat would be a very good one.\n\n77\n00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.386\n>> That's a form of cryptanalysis, right?\n\n78\n00:04:30.386 --> 00:04:35.122\n>> Yeah, those things all fall underneath\nit, so it's not just the offensive\n\n79\n00:04:35.122 --> 00:04:38.710\nside of it where you're trying\nto break those systems.\n\n80\n00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.260\n>> Oh but that's coolest part of it.\n\n81\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.015\n>> Yeah, that's the cool part,\nthat's what we wanna do.\n\n82\n00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.500\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n83\n00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.470\nwhat kind of role does\ncryptanalysis play then, I guess?\n\n84\n00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.840\n>> It's played some very,\nvery significant roles in,\n\n85\n00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.750\nover the course of history, it just has.\n\n86\n00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.210\nI mean, you could point to so many\nincidents where it's made in historical\n\n87\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.980\nevents where it's made just this huge,\nhuge impact.\n\n88\n00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.320\nWe've mentioned a few, and I've,\ngot some examples I' ll talk about later.\n\n89\n00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.550\nBut, it did make a huge impact on things.\n\n90\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.880\nWe've mentioned stuff like\nCivil War with the code breaking,\n\n91\n00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.900\nmentioned stuff with World War I,\nwith the Zimmerman note.\n\n92\n00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.220\nThose were big, significant things.\n\n93\n00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.380\nYou get into World War II,\nthere's some big ones.\n\n94\n00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.360\nThere's some stuff today that we have that\nwould fit in the area of code breaking.\n\n95\n00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.830\nThere's plenty of it out there,\nso it plays a significant role,\n\n96\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.870\njust on finding out what\nsomeone else is doing.\n\n97\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.570\nTalking about developing new systems and\nfiguring out how the other ones work and\n\n98\n00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.140\nimproving on them.\n\n99\n00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.190\nThat's huge,\nit's not all just that code breaking part.\n\n100\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.421\nIt's hey, we got an existing algorithm,\nlet's tweak it and\n\n101\n00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:55.675\nsee what we can do to make it better.\n\n102\n00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:59.330\nLet's fix the flaws, or let's just analyze\nit and figure out there is just no way to\n\n103\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.310\nget rid of those flaws,\nthat thing's crap, just get rid of it.\n\n104\n00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.880\n>> Right.\n>> So there could be a lot\n\n105\n00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.730\nof things happening here,\n\n106\n00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:11.454\neven though we're just looking at a small\nportion of the cryptanalysis spectrum.\n\n107\n00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:14.640\n>> All right, so as a cryptanalyst,\n\n108\n00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.250\nif I want to get into this field and we're\nstudying cryptography here, what kind of\n\n109\n00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.300\nskill set does a person that gets into\ncryptanalysis is going to require?\n\n110\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.150\n>> You're going to need to be first and\nforemost,\n\n111\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.080\nI would say you're going to\nneed to be very creative.\n\n112\n00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.590\nYou need to be one of those\npeople that as they say and\n\n113\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.690\nI hate the term, think outside the box,\nyou better be prepared to do that.\n\n114\n00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.770\nBecause a lot of the times\nthat codes have been broken\n\n115\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.570\nrequired original thinking in breaking\nwhat the existing rules were, or\n\n116\n00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.380\nwhat they thought they were,\nto get a result.\n\n117\n00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.410\nAnd you see that time and\ntime and time again, so\n\n118\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.380\nthat would be one big part of it.\n\n119\n00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.940\nThen there's stuff like the mathematics.\n\n120\n00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:59.120\nIt's an essential part or some people\nmight argue it's not an essential part.\n\n121\n00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.460\nAnd you can make a case that, you know\nyou might be able to use one of our other\n\n122\n00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.290\nskills logic, and coupled with things\nlike creativity, to figure things out.\n\n123\n00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.010\nAnd that does get you some traction, but,\n\n124\n00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:16.250\nat some point if you're gonna stay in\nthis field, and be a cryptanalyst,\n\n125\n00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.700\nthen you're someone that has to get\na really good handle on that map.\n\n126\n00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.290\nAnd we're talking really high\norder type stuff in math.\n\n127\n00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.050\nWe're talking the stuff that's over\nthe horizon and from calculus.\n\n128\n00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.810\n>> Yeah.\n>> Stuff\n\n129\n00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.880\nthat makes calculus\nlooks like simple math.\n\n130\n00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.750\n>> Calculus becomes like Intro to Algebra,\nyeah.\n\n131\n00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.200\n>> Compared to this stuff.\n\n132\n00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.780\nYeah, basically that's what it would be.\n\n133\n00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.303\nHad he had 2 + 2, that's what calculus\nlooks like now compared to the stuff you\n\n134\n00:07:42.303 --> 00:07:43.913\nwill be doing at that point.\n\n135\n00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:47.348\n>> And we've got calculators that I can\nuse to actually do the number crunching,\n\n136\n00:07:47.348 --> 00:07:50.692\nbut I've got to understand the formulas,\nright, and be able to decipher.\n\n137\n00:07:50.692 --> 00:07:52.736\nLike what you threw up\non our screen earlier.\n\n138\n00:07:52.736 --> 00:07:55.874\n>> Yeah, that formula, yeah,\nI could go look online and\n\n139\n00:07:55.874 --> 00:07:57.520\nfigure out what that means.\n\n140\n00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.710\nTake me some time, and\nI'm not the best person at math.\n\n141\n00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.545\nI'm definitely not gonna tell you\nthat oh yeah, I'm a math whiz.\n\n142\n00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:06.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That'd be really messed\n\n143\n00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.010\nup for me to do.\n\n144\n00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.080\n>> There a savant in there?\n\n145\n00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.050\n>> Yeah, like, I knew he was good at\nsomething cuz it clearly isn't teaching.\n\n146\n00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.890\n[LAUGH]\nSo I'm not good at that, but yeah,\n\n147\n00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.200\nyou're right.\n\n148\n00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.530\nWe do have calculators and\nall these things to help us out, but\n\n149\n00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.430\nyou do need to understand\nwhat makes those things tick.\n\n150\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.290\nIf you don't understand what makes them\ntick, you're not gonna go anywhere.\n\n151\n00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:33.060\nHeck, that was my big problem in\nmath when I went through was I had\n\n152\n00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.620\nto know what made it tick, and it just was\nstuff that they weren't willing to teach.\n\n153\n00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.930\nI had to get on that later on,\nto understand the relationships and\n\n154\n00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.040\nthings like that.\n\n155\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.875\nBut no one's gonna expect someone to\ndo all this mathematics in their head.\n\n156\n00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:47.665\nThere's people out there-\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n157\n00:08:47.665 --> 00:08:50.505\n>> And\na little like kinda wacko in the head.\n\n158\n00:08:50.505 --> 00:08:53.615\nBut they're on a different planet than us,\nthe people that can do that.\n\n159\n00:08:53.615 --> 00:08:57.430\nBut for the most part yeah, you understand\nthe relationships and the mechanics of it.\n\n160\n00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.120\nYou'll be using high end stuff\nto get these things done.\n\n161\n00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.910\n>> So creativity, willing to think outside\nof the box to solve these problems,\n\n162\n00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.100\ngood math skills are going\nto be essential.\n\n163\n00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.070\nAnything else I'm going\nto need skill wise?\n\n164\n00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.370\n>> Would be the logic,\n\n165\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:16.320\nbeing able to tape that down would\nbe a very, very good thing to have.\n\n166\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.410\nProbably a little patience.\n\n167\n00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.050\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n168\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.979\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You better be patient and\n\n169\n00:09:19.979 --> 00:09:24.980\nyou better not just be patient, you\nbetter be willing to persevere at this.\n\n170\n00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.720\nYou'll hear stories about people back\nin the old days, kid you not, I mean,\n\n171\n00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.600\nyeah it was a little different time,\nyou're talking during\n\n172\n00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.610\nthe World War II time frame but still,\nthe level of dedication these guys had,\n\n173\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.890\neven considering wartime conditions,\nwas impressive.\n\n174\n00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.870\nThere were stories of guys working\nin places in the Pacific that would\n\n175\n00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:51.310\nwork maybe 22 hours out of the day and\nthen would sleep under their desk,\n\n176\n00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.350\ntake a nap, and then go right back at it,\nand they were doing that day and\n\n177\n00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.670\nday on end, and they would only get\nlonger rests sporadically, you know and\n\n178\n00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.220\ntheir body basically forced them to.\n\n179\n00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.230\nSo, they would just work on teams,\nyou know, crunching these things.\n\n180\n00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.780\nIt makes it really fast when you think\nabout the fact that they were using,\n\n181\n00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.775\nyou know, like I said,\nslide rules and stuff like that.\n\n182\n00:10:11.775 --> 00:10:13.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Stuff nowadays,\n\n183\n00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.035\nmost of us wouldn't even know how\nto operate a slide rule nowadays.\n\n184\n00:10:17.035 --> 00:10:18.530\n>> [LAUGH] Right, we got our smart phones.\n\n185\n00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.825\nHey, I got a slide rule app.\n\n186\n00:10:19.825 --> 00:10:22.750\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, most people would have to look up\n\n187\n00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:28.410\na slide rule nowadays to even figure\nout what it is, must less use one.\n\n188\n00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:29.650\nIn fact, interestingly enough,\n\n189\n00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.110\nthere is still one place where\nslide rules are used all the time.\n\n190\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.660\n>> Oh yeah?\n>> Or a form of them.\n\n191\n00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.780\nAnd outside of that, you don't see him.\n\n192\n00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.610\nAnd that's, anybody who's a pilot\nthere's something called an E6B.\n\n193\n00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.150\nIt's like a circular\nslide rule type thing.\n\n194\n00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.960\nThat's pretty much\nthe only place you see it.\n\n195\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.060\nAnd we even have the digital ones.\n\n196\n00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.661\nBut, like when I was going\nthrough my flight training yeah,\n\n197\n00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:52.140\nthey said you're not using that.\n\n198\n00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:57.015\nThey said here, they said batteries\nfailed, this little laminated thing is\n\n199\n00:10:57.015 --> 00:11:01.149\nyou know if you don't chuck it\nout the window it'll always work.\n\n200\n00:11:01.149 --> 00:11:04.898\nAnd so that's pretty much the only place\nyou're ever going to see that unless\n\n201\n00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:08.254\nsomeone is really set in their ways\nthat they have to use a slide rule.\n\n202\n00:11:08.254 --> 00:11:11.297\nAnd you're talking the old timers\nhave been around for a long time and\n\n203\n00:11:11.297 --> 00:11:15.230\nused those in school and college, but, for\nthe most part, you're not gonna see it.\n\n204\n00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.054\nBut these guys did it with that, and\n\n205\n00:11:17.054 --> 00:11:22.150\nthat's just mind-blowing\nto me to think of.\n\n206\n00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.781\n>> Absolutely.\n\n207\n00:11:22.781 --> 00:11:24.894\nI remember my father had one.\n\n208\n00:11:24.894 --> 00:11:28.726\nHe was a PhD and\nit worked in the labs and he had one.\n\n209\n00:11:28.726 --> 00:11:29.910\nI thought it was just cool to hold.\n\n210\n00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.049\nI had no idea how to use it or anything.\n\n211\n00:11:31.049 --> 00:11:32.976\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I thought it was really cool.\n\n212\n00:11:32.976 --> 00:11:33.951\n>> That's what I did.\nSame thing.\n\n213\n00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:36.481\nI'm moving stuff around like,\nlook, it slides around.\n\n214\n00:11:36.481 --> 00:11:40.190\n[LAUGH] And it lines up numbers,\nI don't know what those numbers mean.\n\n215\n00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:45.260\nAnd I guess maybe, just in case somebody\nhas never seen a slide rule I do have a,\n\n216\n00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.200\non my screen here,\n\n217\n00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.050\nif we want to pull it up real quick\n>> Just a picture of a slide rule, just so\n\n218\n00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.710\nyou guys understand what\nit's looking like there.\n\n219\n00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:57.590\nSo there's a close up of one and you see\nthis middle bar slides back and forth.\n\n220\n00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.050\nAnd then you've got this\nkind of a magnifying lens.\n\n221\n00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.860\n>> That has that line that goes\ndown the middle there, and\n\n222\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.600\nthat'll slide back and forth.\n\n223\n00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.040\nLike I said, that middle bar slides,\nhence the name slide rule.\n\n224\n00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.562\nAnyways, enough of that, moving on.\n\n225\n00:12:12.562 --> 00:12:14.518\n[LAUGH]\n>> My mom was the one that told me,\n\n226\n00:12:14.518 --> 00:12:18.250\nyou know, somewhat about a slide rules and\nhow they worked.\n\n227\n00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:22.968\nAs soon as she used the word\nlogarithms I was like [NOISE] [LAUGH],\n\n228\n00:12:22.968 --> 00:12:26.506\nI didn't know I had that problems,\nyou know,\n\n229\n00:12:26.506 --> 00:12:31.624\nstaying awake even at like eight\nyears old, but apparently I did.\n\n230\n00:12:31.624 --> 00:12:33.342\nSoon as she said that\nthat was the key word.\n\n231\n00:12:33.342 --> 00:12:36.100\n>> That was it, if she wanted to go to\nbed she just start talking about log.\n\n232\n00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.600\nYeah.\n>> Slides.\n\n233\n00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.100\n>> Yeah.\n\n234\n00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.770\nAs soon as you said logarithms and\n\n235\n00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.330\nsine I was like, logi what now?\n\n236\n00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.780\nNew parents out there,\nkeyword, logarithms.\n\n237\n00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.510\n>> So let's say then for the equipment\nnecessary, the cryptanalysis, slide rules\n\n238\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.330\nnot part of it, actually I guess we\nshould say it is part of it, right?\n\n239\n00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.300\n>> Somebody might.\n\n240\n00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.300\nIt could be part of that creative thing.\n\n241\n00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:01.030\nSome of these really creative types\nare just not, they're not normal.\n\n242\n00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.355\nThey're on a different plane of thinking.\n\n243\n00:13:04.355 --> 00:13:06.920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You're not necessarily always\n\n244\n00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.750\ngonna be that way.\n\n245\n00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.770\nBut you get these creative ones and\n\n246\n00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:13.080\nthey may have something\nthat they can relate to.\n\n247\n00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.490\nMakes it easier for them and am I gonna\nargue with a guy that's getting results,\n\n248\n00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:18.705\nthat pulls out a slide rule and\ndoes all this stuff?\n\n249\n00:13:18.705 --> 00:13:20.000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n250\n00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.230\nI'm not going to argue with you.\n\n251\n00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.064\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you've got the job done and\n\n252\n00:13:23.064 --> 00:13:26.037\nyou've got it done in a decent time,\nsomething like that,\n\n253\n00:13:26.037 --> 00:13:27.890\nwho am I to argue with that?\n\n254\n00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:32.340\nBut, yeah you'll see there's\nvarious tools everything from,\n\n255\n00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:37.900\ncould be a slide rule, a pen and\npaper, white board, stuff like that.\n\n256\n00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.570\nYou know, up to having super computers and\nmathematical models, and all sorts of\n\n257\n00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:48.840\nlittle gadgets, and things you've got to\nkind of pull out of your bag of tricks.\n\n258\n00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.135\nYou know, plus, you know, some other\nthings that are gonna make this happen.\n\n259\n00:13:53.135 --> 00:13:57.180\nSometimes it may just be pure luck,\nyou know, or\n\n260\n00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.430\nsome divine inspiration\nif you want to call it.\n\n261\n00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.780\nThat allows you to break an algorithm.\n\n262\n00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.535\nYou've seen these things happen.\n\n263\n00:14:03.535 --> 00:14:07.200\nThey've depicted some of these things,\nyou know, in movies and stuff like that.\n\n264\n00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.930\nIn some of those cases it is true\nthat these guys were, you know,\n\n265\n00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.580\nfrustrated and then all of\na sudden something just clicked.\n\n266\n00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.910\nThey were, you know, bouncing a ball or\nyou know, out having a drink or whatever.\n\n267\n00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:25.505\nAll of a sudden had that moment and they\njust took it into its logical conclusion.\n\n268\n00:14:25.505 --> 00:14:29.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's amazing how often that happens.\n\n269\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.410\n>> Yeah.\n>> That someone just watches something or\n\n270\n00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.750\nsitting around and\n>> Some random inspiration triggers\n\n271\n00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.500\na thought or makes you think of\nsomething in a different way,\n\n272\n00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.440\nthat outside of the box thing.\n\n273\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.030\nInput from people that aren't really\ninvolved or don't do that, and it makes\n\n274\n00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:47.740\nyou think about it in a different light\nand you get that light bulb goes off.\n\n275\n00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.750\n>> Yeah, so you never know the tools and\n\n276\n00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.060\nskills might be that actually\ngets you to that final result.\n\n277\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.992\nYou know,\nthat happens across all the sciences.\n\n278\n00:14:57.992 --> 00:15:04.050\nI know Stephen Hawking\nsays that his disability\n\n279\n00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.790\nactually worked in a certain way to his\n\n280\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:14.460\nadvantage because he has ALS,\nobviously in advanced stages of it.\n\n281\n00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.220\nHe can't write this stuff down or anything\nso he has to develop all these mental\n\n282\n00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:23.630\ntools and then on top of that\nhad a problem, he had a,\n\n283\n00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:28.409\nit wasn't just a simple sore throat but\nhe had a problem and he had to have his.\n\n284\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.292\nPart of his throat or something,\npart of his larynx or something removed.\n\n285\n00:15:33.292 --> 00:15:36.256\nAnd that took his ability\nto speak away too, so\n\n286\n00:15:36.256 --> 00:15:39.904\nnow he's got to figure out ways\nto think this stuff out and\n\n287\n00:15:39.904 --> 00:15:44.996\nconvey it because he can't even talk to\nanybody now except for that computer and\n\n288\n00:15:44.996 --> 00:15:49.936\nwe all know the type of stuff that he's\ndone even if you don't understand it,\n\n289\n00:15:49.936 --> 00:15:53.128\nit's some ground breaking\nReally trippy stuff,\n\n290\n00:15:53.128 --> 00:15:57.691\nwork with black holes and gravity and\nrelativity and all those things.\n\n291\n00:15:57.691 --> 00:16:02.044\n>> All right, so\nnot as fancy as the equipment we've got\n\n292\n00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:06.030\nas a forensic investigator or\na Ethical hacker.\n\n293\n00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.420\nDepending on how you look at it,\nit could be very exciting stuff.\n\n294\n00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:14.840\nAnd let's talk about some organizations\ncuz there have been over the years\n\n295\n00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.950\ngroups of people or organizations\nthat focused on cryptanalysis.\n\n296\n00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:23.520\n>> Yes, there has been plenty\nof these organizations.\n\n297\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.140\nIn our first episode we talked\nabout the history of it.\n\n298\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.268\nWe talked about something\ncalled Black Chambers and\n\n299\n00:16:31.268 --> 00:16:36.183\nthose organizations that have existed,\nand they still exist at the current day.\n\n300\n00:16:36.183 --> 00:16:38.363\nThey just don't call them the same thing.\n\n301\n00:16:38.363 --> 00:16:40.680\nBut those ones existed.\n\n302\n00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.870\nThe first one actually came into\nexistence in Vienna, Austria, way back.\n\n303\n00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And they just started popping up\n\n304\n00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.680\nin other areas.\n\n305\n00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:53.570\nAnd those things were formally called\nblack chambers all the way up until\n\n306\n00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:58.990\nright around the beginning of the first\nworld war just a little bit before it.\n\n307\n00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.110\nThey were called that.\n\n308\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.440\nAnd those were the places where you had\nsomeone that was, you know, skilled or\n\n309\n00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:09.000\npeople who were skilled and more\nknowledgeable then that rest that could\n\n310\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.860\nspend the time to break these things.\n\n311\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.430\nAnd the people that were\nstaffing these things could be\n\n312\n00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.880\njust a single individual\nthat was very talented.\n\n313\n00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:25.075\nOne of the examples I used was Mary Queen\nof Scots, the codebreaker that she\n\n314\n00:17:25.075 --> 00:17:30.155\nhad that we would call a somebody\nthat does cryptanalysis these days,\n\n315\n00:17:30.155 --> 00:17:35.880\nthat guy knew like five or six languages\nand he was fluent in a bunch of things.\n\n316\n00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.350\nVery, very well educated.\n\n317\n00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.110\nThe term they use nowadays, is a polymath.\n\n318\n00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.550\nHe's talented in many, many areas.\n\n319\n00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.220\nHe's somebody like\nGalileo would be another\n\n320\n00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.850\nexample of somebody that's a polymath.\n\n321\n00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:52.661\nIsn't just talented at one area,\ngoes across a whole spectrum of things.\n\n322\n00:17:52.661 --> 00:17:54.668\nThat's what this guy was and\n\n323\n00:17:54.668 --> 00:17:58.940\nwas able to use all those talents\nto break and analyze codes.\n\n324\n00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:04.070\nAmong other things, he had a lot of\nexperience and a lot of knowledge that got\n\n325\n00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:08.250\npoured over into the industry of spycraft,\nwhich would definitely,\n\n326\n00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:12.290\ncryptography and code breaking,\nall that fits very well into that area.\n\n327\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:17.020\nBut he had a, like I said,\na greater knowledge,\n\n328\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.850\na greater level of training and knowledge.\n\n329\n00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:24.940\nApparently he was kind of crafty and\nthings like that, and so he\n\n330\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.885\nwas able to deduce where these codes were,\nhow these messages were getting out for\n\n331\n00:18:29.885 --> 00:18:34.695\nMary Queen of Scots, who was able to\nbreak them and was able to say, tell,\n\n332\n00:18:34.695 --> 00:18:38.205\nwhere most people were gonna say,\ntalking about the fake stuff,\n\n333\n00:18:38.205 --> 00:18:41.587\nthey're real really thoroughly,\nwhere most people might say, hey, well,\n\n334\n00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:46.215\nwe broke the code,\nlet's go and take off her head.\n\n335\n00:18:46.215 --> 00:18:49.277\nNo, he said, put them back and\nsend them on so\n\n336\n00:18:49.277 --> 00:18:51.057\nwe can just root out\nthe whole thing at once.\n\n337\n00:18:52.558 --> 00:18:55.928\nAnd that's the type of person this was.\n\n338\n00:18:55.928 --> 00:18:57.908\nSo very, very diverse.\n\n339\n00:18:57.908 --> 00:19:02.221\nPeople nowadays,\nthey might be if have a black chamber.\n\n340\n00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:03.728\nYou're gonna have a team,\n\n341\n00:19:03.728 --> 00:19:08.261\nit's probably not gonna be one person\nbecause they've gotten to be too complex.\n\n342\n00:19:08.261 --> 00:19:09.049\n>> Right.\n\n343\n00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:13.236\n>> And anybody that's seen that and\neven if you haven't seen it,\n\n344\n00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:15.372\nthat movie The Imitation Game?\n\n345\n00:19:15.372 --> 00:19:19.795\nIt's fictionalized obviously\nto a certain degree but\n\n346\n00:19:19.795 --> 00:19:25.369\nyou see somebody like Allen Turin\nwho the movie was centered around,\n\n347\n00:19:25.369 --> 00:19:30.672\nyou see him trying to solve these\ncodes on his own, but who knows?\n\n348\n00:19:30.672 --> 00:19:35.279\nHe may have solved them entirely on his\nown, but he had to work with a team and\n\n349\n00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:37.490\nbring all those talents into play.\n\n350\n00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.670\nCuz it was just something\nthat was way over his head,\n\n351\n00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.330\nor in a reasonable time that\nhe could have broken it.\n\n352\n00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.930\nHe may never have broken it on his own.\n\n353\n00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.750\nI'm not saying the guy wasn't talented,\nbut\n\n354\n00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:52.350\nit's just something that he had to work\non a team, and that's the way it is.\n\n355\n00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:57.370\nPlaces like the NSA, other agencies\noverseas in other countries,\n\n356\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.000\nall the same way.\n\n357\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.140\nYou've got teams,\npeople that specialize in mathematics\n\n358\n00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.730\nin different areas that can do this.\n\n359\n00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:09.561\nI mean, you may have a team that's got a\nguy that's not a code breaker per se, but\n\n360\n00:20:09.561 --> 00:20:12.851\nhe's the guy that knows math backwards and\nforwards.\n\n361\n00:20:12.851 --> 00:20:14.774\nHe's got all those fancy letters\nnext to his name that say that.\n\n362\n00:20:14.774 --> 00:20:18.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n363\n00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.812\nthat situation isn't uncommon, by the way.\n\n364\n00:20:20.812 --> 00:20:25.180\nYou would think for example, engineers,\npeople that do aerospace mechanical.\n\n365\n00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.360\nThat they'd be good at math, and they are.\n\n366\n00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.700\nBut they let the computers do a lot.\n\n367\n00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.180\nWhen they're trying to think of something\nnew, like designing radar systems or\n\n368\n00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:37.380\nsomething like that, they've got someone\non staff that is pretty much on call.\n\n369\n00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.420\nThat's the math wiz.\n\n370\n00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.800\nThis guy doesn't do anything with\nengineering, anything with anything else.\n\n371\n00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.560\nThis guy knows all sorts of things\nin his head to do with math.\n\n372\n00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:50.220\nThey call on him to solve unique problem\nor the way to calculate something out.\n\n373\n00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.030\nAnd so\nthat's somebody you can have on this team.\n\n374\n00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:57.360\nSo you can have a very\ndiverse set of skills here.\n\n375\n00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.700\nBut yeah in a black chamber it used to\nbe just one now it's more than one and\n\n376\n00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.550\nthey get very,\nvery good results with this.\n\n377\n00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.130\n>> All right.\nAnd\n\n378\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.441\nthen there's other's who\ntalk about the room 40.\n\n379\n00:21:09.441 --> 00:21:11.601\n>> Room 40's an interesting one.\n\n380\n00:21:11.601 --> 00:21:17.721\nI said a few moments ago that the term\nblack chamber has been phased out.\n\n381\n00:21:17.721 --> 00:21:18.340\n>> Mh-mm.\n\n382\n00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.420\n>> It was a dead giveaway.\n\n383\n00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.368\nYou call it a black chamber.\n\n384\n00:21:21.368 --> 00:21:22.719\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's kind of like, yeah,\n\n385\n00:21:22.719 --> 00:21:23.348\nwell we got one too.\n\n386\n00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:24.248\n>> I wonder what they're doing there.\n\n387\n00:21:24.248 --> 00:21:26.508\n>> Yeah, it's like.\n\n388\n00:21:26.508 --> 00:21:29.687\nYou didn't have to be as one\nof my friends used to say,\n\n389\n00:21:29.687 --> 00:21:33.308\nyou don't have to be a rocket\nsurgeon to figure that one out.\n\n390\n00:21:33.308 --> 00:21:39.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So a room 40 is what they had in UK.\n\n391\n00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:43.990\nThey changed their black chamber over to,\nand Chuck called it room 40,\n\n392\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.770\nso this was during the First World War.\n\n393\n00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:51.550\nIf you heard the term room 40 being used,\nit was their code breaking effort.\n\n394\n00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:56.610\nIt was something very innocuous and\nvery, just ordinary.\n\n395\n00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.270\nSo that was it.\n\n396\n00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.390\nAnd they didn't wanna\nattract attention to it.\n\n397\n00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.170\nAll right?\n\n398\n00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.242\nThat's kinda funny when\nI think about this.\n\n399\n00:22:03.242 --> 00:22:04.651\nRoom 40, what's the other one?\n\n400\n00:22:04.651 --> 00:22:09.035\nI know someone here is gonna point\nit out I know but is it 1984,\n\n401\n00:22:09.035 --> 00:22:12.961\nthat novel by Orwell,\nthere's that room at the end of it.\n\n402\n00:22:12.961 --> 00:22:15.830\nI wanna say it's room 100 or\nroom 120 or something like that.\n\n403\n00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.135\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> It's like, so\n\n404\n00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:21.371\nwhoever the British people are in here\nfrom the UK explain yourselves and\n\n405\n00:22:21.371 --> 00:22:25.745\nwhy it has to be all the rooms, when you\nhave us room labeled out some place or\n\n406\n00:22:25.745 --> 00:22:28.603\nsomething ominous or\ndifferent going on there.\n\n407\n00:22:28.603 --> 00:22:30.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Code breaking or throw a book,\n\n408\n00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.258\nwhether interrogating someone.\n\n409\n00:22:32.258 --> 00:22:32.852\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n410\n00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:34.391\n>> I need an explanation and\nI want it now.\n\n411\n00:22:34.391 --> 00:22:38.111\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but yeah, that was theirs.\n\n412\n00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:40.531\nIt's not obviously called room 40 now.\n\n413\n00:22:40.531 --> 00:22:46.351\nIt's been changed into something\ndifferent, but the concept is still there.\n\n414\n00:22:46.351 --> 00:22:49.071\nIt's just more advanced.\n\n415\n00:22:49.071 --> 00:22:54.960\nBack room 40, during the second world war,\nthey pushed that over to Bletchley Park.\n\n416\n00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.830\nThat was an interesting one because they,\nand just for\n\n417\n00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.600\nthe record that Bletchley Park\nthat was out in the countryside,\n\n418\n00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.550\nthat was way way out in the countryside.\n\n419\n00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:08.130\nThey kept it away from everything for\na good reason.\n\n420\n00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:14.870\nDuring the second World War the Nazi's\nwere hitting London relentlessly so\n\n421\n00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.070\nyou had a lot of stuff happening so\nthey just moved that in the country so\n\n422\n00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.480\nit was away from everything and\nthe put it on a farm, of all places.\n\n423\n00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.220\nIt was a working farm.\n\n424\n00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.450\nThey had sheep and stuff like that\ngoing around, doing the thing.\n\n425\n00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.760\nIt didn't look like anything at all.\n\n426\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.380\nThere's people out in the country, and\n\n427\n00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:35.330\nthey kept everything pretty\nmuch very well under wraps.\n\n428\n00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.860\nNot really that many people\nexcept those in the know,\n\n429\n00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.350\nhappened to be aware that it was there.\n\n430\n00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.290\nAnd so they did some pretty significant\nstuff out there just sitting in\n\n431\n00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.690\nthe middle of nowhere.\n\n432\n00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.239\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n433\n00:23:45.239 --> 00:23:47.411\nto tell you about\nthe determination they had,\n\n434\n00:23:47.411 --> 00:23:50.919\nI think about that shows you the\ndetermination that people have, when they\n\n435\n00:23:50.919 --> 00:23:55.003\nhad a situation in Bletchley Park there's\nactually, when you see the pictures of it.\n\n436\n00:23:55.003 --> 00:23:57.737\nThere's actually like one of\nthose turret shaped rooms,\n\n437\n00:23:57.737 --> 00:24:00.930\ncircular silo looking rooms\nthey stick on houses?\n\n438\n00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.750\nThat was Turing's office.\n\n439\n00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.550\nAllen Turing, it was his office.\n\n440\n00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:10.431\nAnd apparently during one of the raids,\nsomehow a stray bomb hit that area and\n\n441\n00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:16.040\nhit nearby and actually knocked that\nturret a little bit off its foundation.\n\n442\n00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.634\nAnd he kept working while\nthey winched it back on.\n\n443\n00:24:18.634 --> 00:24:20.530\n[LAUGH] He just kept going.\n\n444\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:24.170\nCan you imagine, someone knocks\nthe building out from underneath you?\n\n445\n00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.590\nIt's like, yeah just move it back.\n\n446\n00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:26.420\nI'll be here.\n\n447\n00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.260\nJust keep doing it.\n\n448\n00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.160\nThat's what this dude did, so\nyou gotta admire that sort of dedication.\n\n449\n00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:31.710\n>> Absolutely.\n\n450\n00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.730\n>> I'd punch the clock and go home.\n\n451\n00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:34.670\nThat's my limit.\n\n452\n00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.050\nBuilding's gone, I go home.\n\n453\n00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:37.814\n>> Not us, we wouldn't do that.\n\n454\n00:24:37.814 --> 00:24:40.520\nHey it's raining,\nwe're gonna call it a day [SOUND] [LAUGH]\n\n455\n00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.796\n>> Yeah, we'll stick it out, no problem.\n\n456\n00:24:42.796 --> 00:24:47.569\n>> And then you got the NSA who I believe\nhas gotten completely out of code breaking\n\n457\n00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:48.300\nand stuff.\n\n458\n00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.305\n>> Yeah, they don't do that.\n\n459\n00:24:49.305 --> 00:24:49.970\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.010\n>> They're, yeah,\n\n461\n00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:53.510\nguys know what NSA stands for, right?\n\n462\n00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.790\nNo such agency.\n\n463\n00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:55.445\n>> That's right.\n\n464\n00:24:55.445 --> 00:24:57.220\n[LAUGH]\n>> Just remember that.\n\n465\n00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.510\nJust remember that, citizen.\n\n466\n00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.975\nAnd you guys ask questions,\nit's good for you.\n\n467\n00:25:00.975 --> 00:25:04.245\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> NSA's been around for\n\n468\n00:25:04.245 --> 00:25:09.526\nquite a long time themselves and\nthat's their business.\n\n469\n00:25:09.526 --> 00:25:13.354\nThat's their main business\nis signals analysis and\n\n470\n00:25:13.354 --> 00:25:18.060\ncode breaking and doing all\nthe stuff that we are talking about.\n\n471\n00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:23.210\nThey are very heavily into that,\nthey will let you know they're into that.\n\n472\n00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.793\nBut anymore than that,\nyou're asking too many questions,\n\n473\n00:25:25.793 --> 00:25:30.465\nthat is the way they look at it but\nthat is their mission.\n\n474\n00:25:30.465 --> 00:25:35.060\nThat's it, they're heavily,\nheavily invested in doing that.\n\n475\n00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:42.115\nThey got top flight code breakers\nin cryptoanalysis in their agency.\n\n476\n00:25:42.115 --> 00:25:43.925\nThey recruit people all the time.\n\n477\n00:25:43.925 --> 00:25:45.665\nAnd yeah, there's actually, and\n\n478\n00:25:45.665 --> 00:25:50.435\nglad you put that out, they have that\npublic thing, that history thing.\n\n479\n00:25:50.435 --> 00:25:52.360\nI believe they also have\nthe museum on site.\n\n480\n00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.797\n>> They've got that museum the National\nCryptologic Museum is up there I\n\n481\n00:25:55.797 --> 00:25:56.445\nbelieve so.\n\n482\n00:25:56.445 --> 00:25:59.201\n>> There's even if you look at,\nI don't know if you can find it but\n\n483\n00:25:59.201 --> 00:26:00.504\nthere's a piece of artwork.\n\n484\n00:26:00.504 --> 00:26:05.022\nI call it, I've seen it, there's\nactually it looks like the windows logo,\n\n485\n00:26:05.022 --> 00:26:06.750\nthat's what I call it.\n\n486\n00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:11.400\nThere's a piece of artwork out in\nfront of the NSA it's just black and\n\n487\n00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.050\nit's got a bunch of things\ndrilled into it and all that and\n\n488\n00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:16.870\nyou look at it and I just was like.\n\n489\n00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.100\nWhat the heck?\n\n490\n00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.290\nWhat is that?\n\n491\n00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:22.130\nIt's actually a message written in code.\n\n492\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:26.620\nThe artist put this piece of artwork\nout there, the NSA commissioned it.\n\n493\n00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.980\nAnd he stuck it out there.\n\n494\n00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.900\nAnd it looks kind of like, if you\nlook at it at the right angle it does\n\n495\n00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.910\nlook like the little swirly Windows logo.\n\n496\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.590\nFrom, you know, from a while ago.\n\n497\n00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.440\nAnd it's broken into four panels.\n\n498\n00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.430\nAnd each panel is written\nin a different code.\n\n499\n00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:45.800\nAnd there's actually a massive code\nbreaking effort that's been going on for\n\n500\n00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.160\na long time for the, with that.\n\n501\n00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.200\nAnd they've broken, I think last time\nI heard it was like three of the four\n\n502\n00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.850\npanels, and\nthe fourth one has still not been broken.\n\n503\n00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.198\nSo there's people still working on it.\n\n504\n00:26:58.198 --> 00:27:01.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then there was actually controversy\n\n505\n00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:06.690\nat some point is that cryptography is\nsomething that is very powerful, but\n\n506\n00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.250\nit's also very delicate too.\n\n507\n00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:12.757\nIf you move one little thing around in\nthe formula, or anything else in the code,\n\n508\n00:27:12.757 --> 00:27:15.230\nyou can have an entirely different result.\n\n509\n00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:20.162\nThe artist that made this thing,\nthat made that sculpture,\n\n510\n00:27:20.162 --> 00:27:25.790\nwhen they gave him the actual\nencrypted stuff to put on there.\n\n511\n00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:30.110\nHe apparently at one point he said okay,\nthat's out of place,\n\n512\n00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:31.800\nI'm gonna add a couple things here.\n\n513\n00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.300\n>> What?\n\n514\n00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.710\n>> Yeah, it screwed the message\nup just a little bit, and\n\n515\n00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:39.140\nso the people were actually\nable to base their\n\n516\n00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.510\ncode breaking on those characters they\ndidn't know weren't supposed to be there.\n\n517\n00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.068\nAnd so-\n>> If you wanna pull up my screen real\n\n518\n00:27:44.068 --> 00:27:46.058\nquick, I could show you guys\nwhat he's talking about.\n\n519\n00:27:46.058 --> 00:27:47.859\n>> Did you find it?\n>> Yeah, it's out in front of the NSA.\n\n520\n00:27:47.859 --> 00:27:51.293\n[COUGH] So to just give you an idea\nof what he's talking about there.\n\n521\n00:27:51.293 --> 00:27:54.550\n>> Yeah, there you go\n>> And if I zoom in, you can see it's a,\n\n522\n00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.932\nyeah I think this picture has been\nreversed, but, unless it's part of the-\n\n523\n00:27:58.932 --> 00:27:59.629\n>> Or has it?\n\n524\n00:27:59.629 --> 00:28:00.560\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or has it,\n\n525\n00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.160\ncuz this side looks like it's correct.\n\n526\n00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.825\n>> It's just a big transposition cipher.\n\n527\n00:28:04.825 --> 00:28:05.933\n[LAUGH]\n>> Just another piece of the puzzle, yeah.\n\n528\n00:28:05.933 --> 00:28:07.349\n[LAUGH] Her transistors got reversed.\n\n529\n00:28:07.349 --> 00:28:08.371\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's what we did.\n\n530\n00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:11.090\nThat's how clever we are here.\n\n531\n00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:15.600\nBut yeah, that's that piece of artwork\nthat they've got sitting out there.\n\n532\n00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.160\nAnd three of those four have been broken,\nand as far as I know, the fourth one\n\n533\n00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:26.450\nhasn't been broken but like I said\nthe artist added padding on it.\n\n534\n00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.930\n>> Right\n>> He was like oops, sorry, my bad.\n\n535\n00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.400\nHe was like put that message out oops.\n\n536\n00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.530\nSo there's a little bit of\na screw up in there and\n\n537\n00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:40.180\nI think it's only him and\none other guy who actually knows it.\n\n538\n00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.510\nThat knows what the plain\ntext message is and so\n\n539\n00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:47.670\nwhy presume it's code breaking, if someone\ngets the message right, they will say yes,\n\n540\n00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.105\nthat's what it was and confirm it.\n\n541\n00:28:49.105 --> 00:28:55.200\nBut other than that, he won't give you\nanything on what, he's occasionally\n\n542\n00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.010\nkinda danced around it and teased people\nwith things, but that's about it.\n\n543\n00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.760\n>> There's our new challenge for\nour next book then.\n\n544\n00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.650\nYou must decode the fourth panel\non the sign out front of the NSA.\n\n545\n00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.660\n>> Yeah,\nafter all the stuff we've got in here,\n\n546\n00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.980\nthis is the best search engine,\nI've said it several times.\n\n547\n00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.332\nThis chatroom is the best search engine.\n\n548\n00:29:12.332 --> 00:29:14.449\nI can throw out anything random and\n\n549\n00:29:14.449 --> 00:29:18.200\nthey'll get it within a few\nmoments like watch this.\n\n550\n00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:23.480\nSomeone look up the number for\nthat room in 1984, tell me what it is.\n\n551\n00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.590\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> Yeah, go ahead, watch.\n\n552\n00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:29.598\nIt'll be there like in, in 10 seconds,\n20 seconds something like that.\n\n553\n00:29:29.598 --> 00:29:33.612\nBut, that's, they apparently that fourth\npanel, the reason why he's got it set,\n\n554\n00:29:33.612 --> 00:29:36.870\ngot it so that only two people know it,\nis this guy's planned ahead.\n\n555\n00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:42.100\nHe said apparently the thing is so\ncomplex, that just in case he croaks,\n\n556\n00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.379\nhe's got someone else that's got his back.\n\n557\n00:29:45.379 --> 00:29:45.937\n>> See?\n\n558\n00:29:45.937 --> 00:29:50.160\n>> [LAUGH] Room 101, right there.\n\n559\n00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:50.660\n>> Yep.\n\n560\n00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:57.690\n>> Piece of trivia about that,\nthat room in 1984, yeah that was the room,\n\n561\n00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.740\nthat Winston, they interrogated\nhim at the end and everything.\n\n562\n00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.200\nEast Germany, their police force,\nthe guy there wanted to have such a,\n\n563\n00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.900\nthe guy was head of it at one point,\nwanted to be so ominous and everything.\n\n564\n00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.264\nThat he knew about that Room 101 in\nthe book and about them torturing him and\n\n565\n00:30:12.264 --> 00:30:13.682\nusing the spheres against him.\n\n566\n00:30:13.682 --> 00:30:16.722\nThat he had all the numbers\nin the building redone so\n\n567\n00:30:16.722 --> 00:30:18.429\nhis office was room 101.\n\n568\n00:30:18.429 --> 00:30:19.022\nKid you not.\n\n569\n00:30:19.022 --> 00:30:20.231\nLook it up.\n\n570\n00:30:20.231 --> 00:30:22.510\nThat's how serious this\nguy was doing that.\n\n571\n00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.620\nI think it was even on\nthe second floor too.\n\n572\n00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.670\nAnd they renamed stuff.\n\n573\n00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.545\nYou can do that in a communist\ncountry apparently.\n\n574\n00:30:27.545 --> 00:30:30.240\n>> [LAUGH] And just for everybody's info,\n\n575\n00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.640\nthat actually came from\nDaniel Lowry our ITPROTV staff.\n\n576\n00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.970\nWithout the aid of Google,\nbelieve it or not [LAUGH].\n\n577\n00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.720\nThat was straight out of the old\nnoggin there on Daniel Lowry,\n\n578\n00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.440\nso thumbs up for him.\n\n579\n00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.700\n>> And it sounded like\nMorgan Freeman when he did it.\n\n580\n00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:43.290\n>> It did.\n\n581\n00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:44.482\n>> So.\n\n582\n00:30:44.482 --> 00:30:46.660\n>> All right, ladies and gentlemen,\nlooking at the clock it's about time for\n\n583\n00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.280\nus to take a break.\n\n584\n00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.700\nSo we're going to step away.\n\n585\n00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:53.750\nWhen we come back, more on code breaking\nand cryptoanalysis so stay tuned.\n\n586\n00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:54.575\nWe'll be right back\n\n587\n00:30:54.575 --> 00:31:01.083\n[MUSIC]\n\n588\n00:31:01.083 --> 00:31:02.997\nAll right welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n589\n00:31:02.997 --> 00:31:07.553\nSo we left off talking about some of the\nskill sets required as well as really what\n\n590\n00:31:07.553 --> 00:31:09.394\ncryptoanalysis was all about.\n\n591\n00:31:09.394 --> 00:31:11.923\nWhat kind of skills we were gonna need,\nand\n\n592\n00:31:11.923 --> 00:31:14.398\nwhat kind of equipment we might be using.\n\n593\n00:31:14.398 --> 00:31:18.639\nAnd then about some of the organizations\nthat we've seen throughout history that\n\n594\n00:31:18.639 --> 00:31:20.426\nhave focused on cryptoanalysis.\n\n595\n00:31:20.426 --> 00:31:23.488\nAnd that kind of leads us right in to our\nnext little section we want to talk about.\n\n596\n00:31:23.488 --> 00:31:26.663\nWhich is some of the significant\nevents in history that\n\n597\n00:31:26.663 --> 00:31:29.870\ncryptoanalysis has played a big role in,\nright Sean?\n\n598\n00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:34.800\n>> Yeah, this is meant, not go into\nthe depth of history that we did on,\n\n599\n00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.699\nwe did in our first episode, but\nit kind of gives you some ideas of.\n\n600\n00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:45.727\nNot just the places where they had broken\ncodes, but what the impact of that was,\n\n601\n00:31:45.727 --> 00:31:50.536\nbecause it is quite substantial\nwhere the stuff actually shows up.\n\n602\n00:31:50.536 --> 00:31:54.617\nOne of we talked about, just various\nevents, we talked of course about\n\n603\n00:31:54.617 --> 00:31:59.106\nthe World War I, but then there were,\nif we go ahead And focus on enigma because\n\n604\n00:31:59.106 --> 00:32:03.760\nit's in a lot of people's minds nowadays\nbecause of movies and stuff like that.\n\n605\n00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.500\nSo, we'll just keep using that.\n\n606\n00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.110\nBut, just to give you an idea,\n\n607\n00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:13.340\nremember the enigma machine was\nthat typewriter looking thing.\n\n608\n00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.745\nI wonder how long we'll be able\nto use that analogy, typewriter?\n\n609\n00:32:15.745 --> 00:32:16.615\n>> [LAUGH] Not too much longer.\n\n610\n00:32:16.615 --> 00:32:18.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna have to tell this kids,\n\n611\n00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.750\nyeah it's like a printer\nwith a keyboard on it.\n\n612\n00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:21.620\n>> Yeah.\n>> Of course,\n\n613\n00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:26.175\nthey're not using printers nearly\nas much as they used to either so.\n\n614\n00:32:26.175 --> 00:32:26.845\n[LAUGH] Daddy what's a printer?\n\n615\n00:32:26.845 --> 00:32:30.943\n[LAUGH] I hate you.\n\n616\n00:32:30.943 --> 00:32:34.968\nBut anyway enigma,\nwe know about the details of that,\n\n617\n00:32:34.968 --> 00:32:38.478\nhaving different routers and\nstuff like that.\n\n618\n00:32:38.478 --> 00:32:42.680\nSo it was a pretty ingenious\npiece of machinery.\n\n619\n00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:47.710\nAnd it was tweaked and stuff like that,\nfrom its initial creation, all the way on\n\n620\n00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:52.930\nthrough when the Nazis and the different\nparts of their militaries used it.\n\n621\n00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:57.053\nInterestingly enough by the way,\nwhen it was broken, it was still used and\n\n622\n00:32:57.053 --> 00:32:58.170\nsold after the war.\n\n623\n00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:03.399\nIt wasn't as popular anymore, but\nthere were still countries in Europe,\n\n624\n00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:08.140\nin Russia, Asia and South America\nthat were using these machines.\n\n625\n00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.550\nSo some of these things,\n\n626\n00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:13.121\nyou find these really good examples\nof them being sold online.\n\n627\n00:33:13.121 --> 00:33:16.706\nA lot of that's because they\nwere still being used and\n\n628\n00:33:16.706 --> 00:33:20.460\npeople just took them to do\ndifferent things with them.\n\n629\n00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:24.670\nBut of course some of them just\nwere where someone took it out for\n\n630\n00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:29.190\nthe wars as a spoil of war or something,\nso you still see some of those.\n\n631\n00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:34.060\nInteresting little piece of technology,\nif you ever get to play with one.\n\n632\n00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.220\nYou can make one nowadays,\ninstructions are out there.\n\n633\n00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.600\nAnd then you can buy them\nif you get lucky enough and\n\n634\n00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.375\nhave a lot of money laying around.\n\n635\n00:33:42.375 --> 00:33:46.780\n[LAUGH] Yeah, someone told me\nwhen I was writing this book,\n\n636\n00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.530\nthey said hey, we found one you can buy,\nsince we know you're into this stuff.\n\n637\n00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:56.105\nI'm like okay, cool, and I looked at\nthe ad for it and there was a bunch of\n\n638\n00:33:56.105 --> 00:34:00.605\nfour-letter words that went back my\nway from my way their direction for\n\n639\n00:34:00.605 --> 00:34:04.880\npulling that prank on me,\ncuz this one was like $175,000,\n\n640\n00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.787\nit wasn't even,\nit wasn't even like a good example either.\n\n641\n00:34:08.787 --> 00:34:11.670\nYou know.\n>> Right, non-working here.\n\n642\n00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.310\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and you know, you can't,\n\n643\n00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:15.470\nthere's nothing, just a regular machine.\n\n644\n00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:19.000\nThere was nothing like,\nhey it was a unique example or\n\n645\n00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.580\nsomething significant happened with it,\nyou know.\n\n646\n00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:26.040\nIt wasn't like if you're gonna order\na sandwich with this or something.\n\n647\n00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.300\n>> Right.\n>> It's just a machine,\n\n648\n00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.580\nyou know something like that.\n\n649\n00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.890\nBut that's just tells you\nthe significance of it, but\n\n650\n00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:37.080\nalso, they're still out there,\ngood condition ones.\n\n651\n00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.050\nBut anyway, enough of that.\n\n652\n00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:42.920\nSo yeah, they did crack enigma, and\n\n653\n00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:48.120\nthey found some flaws in it, and they were\nactually able to use just a plain and\n\n654\n00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.450\nsimple, brute force attack against it.\n\n655\n00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:56.060\nWith some tweaks and\nto put things into and\n\n656\n00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:00.040\nto kind of qualify substance we\nare talking about crypt analysis now.\n\n657\n00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:04.950\nIf you believe it or not, in some circle\nthey do not consider brute forcing\n\n658\n00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:07.300\nan algorithm,\nthey do not consider that to be an attack.\n\n659\n00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.135\nAnd the reason why is because I consider\na tack to be something that's a more\n\n660\n00:35:11.135 --> 00:35:13.830\nwell-planned and thought out and\nhas some structure to it.\n\n661\n00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:17.640\nOr brute force is just hey keep\npounding on it until something happens.\n\n662\n00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.870\n>> All right.\n>> I can see their point.\n\n663\n00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:23.010\nI guess someone's trying to say,\noh well no that's what everyone else does.\n\n664\n00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:24.310\nWe've got the more advanced stuff.\n\n665\n00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:25.211\nWe got slide rules.\n\n666\n00:35:25.211 --> 00:35:26.232\nI don't know.\nWhatever.\n\n667\n00:35:26.232 --> 00:35:31.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, they broke enigma.\n\n668\n00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.210\nYou can actually find something online,\nyou can find pictures of it.\n\n669\n00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:38.810\nThere's only one of them left,\nis something called the bomb machine or\n\n670\n00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:40.340\nbomba something.\n\n671\n00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:44.222\nThere's a way of pronouncing it,\nthat's European, and I don't know,\n\n672\n00:35:44.222 --> 00:35:46.362\nI can't speak whatever language it is.\n\n673\n00:35:46.362 --> 00:35:50.969\n[LAUGH] I know there was a way of\npronouncing, it wasn't just B-O-M-B,\n\n674\n00:35:50.969 --> 00:35:52.471\nit was B-O-M-B-E.\n\n675\n00:35:52.471 --> 00:35:54.040\nYou may be able to find a picture.\n\n676\n00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.880\n>> Let's see if I can find it real quick.\n\n677\n00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.040\n>> They actually illustrate it pretty good\nin the movie, it was a big machine, and\n\n678\n00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.370\nit had a bunch of dials and\neverything on it.\n\n679\n00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:04.900\nAnd, it was able to do, in essence,\na brute force attack against things.\n\n680\n00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:09.837\nAnd it worked very well, and\ntheir breaking of enigma actually showed\n\n681\n00:36:09.837 --> 00:36:13.446\nus the way some of our later\nattacks are gonna work.\n\n682\n00:36:13.446 --> 00:36:17.526\nSo without getting into\nall the mechanics of it,\n\n683\n00:36:17.526 --> 00:36:22.103\none of the things they were\nactually able to use to break\n\n684\n00:36:22.103 --> 00:36:26.181\nenigma was not just the flaws\nin the machine, but\n\n685\n00:36:26.181 --> 00:36:31.882\nthey were also able to use some\ncommon sense and some logic mixed in.\n\n686\n00:36:31.882 --> 00:36:34.122\nNon-mathematical stuff.\n\n687\n00:36:34.122 --> 00:36:38.545\nThey figured out that there were\ncertain things that were going to be\n\n688\n00:36:38.545 --> 00:36:40.263\nin every communication.\n\n689\n00:36:40.263 --> 00:36:45.568\nAnd in the case of Nazi communications, it\nwas stuff like all the messages were going\n\n690\n00:36:45.568 --> 00:36:50.722\nto be closed with stuff like heil Hitler\nor hail the Fuhrer, something like that,\n\n691\n00:36:50.722 --> 00:36:55.579\nI think it was Heil Hitler they knew they\nwere gonna close every message with,\n\n692\n00:36:55.579 --> 00:36:58.221\nso they knew that text was gonna be there.\n\n693\n00:36:58.221 --> 00:37:01.233\nWell, if you know that\ntext is gonna be there,\n\n694\n00:37:01.233 --> 00:37:06.101\nall you have to do is now once you\nknow it's there, it's just see what's,\n\n695\n00:37:06.101 --> 00:37:10.144\nis look for a sequence that matches or\nsomewhat close to that.\n\n696\n00:37:10.144 --> 00:37:14.550\nAnd you can now all the sudden start\nsaying I know what they decrypts to,\n\n697\n00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:18.514\nnow I can start reverse engineering\nthe rest of the mechanism and\n\n698\n00:37:18.514 --> 00:37:23.630\nhow the keys work, because you've just\ntaken a lot of work out of the picture.\n\n699\n00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:27.980\nSo the exhaustive, true,\nbrute force tact you'd have to do,\n\n700\n00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:31.920\nwhich is going through every key,\nnow you can throw some of those out.\n\n701\n00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.670\nBecause you know they won't work\nto translate that phrase into that\n\n702\n00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:37.650\ncipher text.\n\n703\n00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:39.050\n>> That much closer to solving it.\n\n704\n00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:40.540\nAnd there's that picture\nyou were looking for,\n\n705\n00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.640\nof the Bomba, or\nwhatever they want to call that guy.\n\n706\n00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.960\n>> Yeah.\nAnd there was bunches of these, too.\n\n707\n00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.590\nThere wasn't just one.\n\n708\n00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:50.610\nThere was rooms of these\nthings that they had.\n\n709\n00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:52.840\nIt was crazy.\n\n710\n00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.239\nI mean there's pictures,\nI mean that's just one of them.\n\n711\n00:37:55.239 --> 00:37:57.328\nBut there's one of them sitting there.\n\n712\n00:37:57.328 --> 00:38:02.390\nBut there's pictures of a whole room,\n>> Just rooms full of these things.\n\n713\n00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:03.380\n>> Full of these things.\n\n714\n00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.980\nMost of those things got\ndestroyed after the war.\n\n715\n00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:09.370\n>> Right.\n>> I think the crypto museum at,\n\n716\n00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.410\nBletchley Park.\n\n717\n00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:15.520\nI want to say that the ones they have,\nthey have the only one still in existence.\n\n718\n00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.571\nIn fact, some of those color\nphotos that you see in there,\n\n719\n00:38:18.571 --> 00:38:22.114\nthey may very well be [CROSSTALK]\n>> That was from one of the museums yeah,\n\n720\n00:38:22.114 --> 00:38:25.046\nbecause you can see the railing\naround like this one here.\n\n721\n00:38:25.046 --> 00:38:28.289\nYou can see the railing around it so\nprobably from the museum.\n\n722\n00:38:28.289 --> 00:38:33.230\n>> Yeah I know that it's-\n>> Contribution.\n\n723\n00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:34.370\n>> I don't think that one's it.\n\n724\n00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:39.210\nThe bomba has the wheels on it,\nI think you've got.\n\n725\n00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:43.710\nFurther up, yeah, like that one\nright in the middle, that one.\n\n726\n00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:48.470\nThat would be an example of that system.\n\n727\n00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.650\nThey came up with that,\nthe design for that and it worked.\n\n728\n00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:59.410\nYou know using brute force with\na little bit of extra knowledge and,\n\n729\n00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.600\nmixed into it worked very effectively.\n\n730\n00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:06.900\nBut after the war these things were no\nlonger useful and they got chucked.\n\n731\n00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:12.370\nAs far as I know any that exist\nnowadays are reproductions except for\n\n732\n00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:15.750\nthe one that the British\nwere able to retain.\n\n733\n00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:19.162\nI guess they thought might be good to set\nup at the museum [LAUGH] something some\n\n734\n00:39:19.162 --> 00:39:20.810\nday so they kept that one.\n\n735\n00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:24.310\nBut it's incredible looking\nat something like that.\n\n736\n00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:27.270\nThey said when that thing was there\nwas just a lot of rumbling and\n\n737\n00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:31.310\nstuff like that, lot of really noisy click\nclick click click and all that going on.\n\n738\n00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:32.530\nBut it worked.\n\n739\n00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.010\nIt works.\n\n740\n00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:37.825\nIt's just fascinating what\na little ingenuity and creativity.\n\n741\n00:39:37.825 --> 00:39:39.500\n>> Absolutely.\n>> That's what I'm saying, will do.\n\n742\n00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.695\nA little creativity will go a long,\nlong way.\n\n743\n00:39:42.695 --> 00:39:48.834\nBut anyway so what happened as a result of\ndoing that I mean so there was a major,\n\n744\n00:39:48.834 --> 00:39:53.951\nmajor significance to using those\ndevices and breaking enigma so\n\n745\n00:39:53.951 --> 00:39:59.737\nwhen they broke enigma the impact it had,\nit's just a small set of it too.\n\n746\n00:39:59.737 --> 00:40:05.280\nOperations sea lion, that was one that\ngot, that was advanced knowledge of.\n\n747\n00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.106\nIt was later called off because the Nazis\n\n748\n00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:12.880\ncouldn't get the conditions\nthat they needed.\n\n749\n00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.420\nThat were favorable to that invasion\nthat was a planned land invasion of\n\n750\n00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.642\nEngland and they need to have\nair superiority and superior or\n\n751\n00:40:22.642 --> 00:40:26.640\nthe channel and\na couple other things also, fair weather.\n\n752\n00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:32.731\nBut because of other events that were\nhappening, they just couldn't get that and\n\n753\n00:40:32.731 --> 00:40:37.851\nthey kept delaying it and eventually\nit got, Hitler called it off and\n\n754\n00:40:37.851 --> 00:40:41.754\nturned his attention towards\nthe Soviets instead.\n\n755\n00:40:41.754 --> 00:40:47.774\nIn fact, the event that actually started,\nor had an impact on Operation Sea Lion,\n\n756\n00:40:47.774 --> 00:40:52.820\nthis is another one I put in my list,\nwas the Battle of Britain.\n\n757\n00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:58.260\nBattle of Britain was\na substantial event in history.\n\n758\n00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:03.840\nI mean, you got Churchill, or was that\nnever have so many, owed so much, so few.\n\n759\n00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.530\nThat statement that was\nfrom the Battle of Britain.\n\n760\n00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.660\nYou had these guys just going\nup on mission, after mission,\n\n761\n00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:13.460\nafter mission to defend\nEngland successfully.\n\n762\n00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:18.610\nAnd because the Germans could\nnot get air superiority,\n\n763\n00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:21.890\nit impacted, it delayed other\nthings like Operation Seal Lion\n\n764\n00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:26.640\nwhich eventually got canceled but they\nwere able to get advanced warning that\n\n765\n00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:31.505\nthe Luftwaffe was sending major\nair power their direction.\n\n766\n00:41:31.505 --> 00:41:33.915\nThey were able to get it because\nthey had broken Enigma, so\n\n767\n00:41:33.915 --> 00:41:37.435\nthey were able to be adequately prepared\nto scramble aircraft to get them in\n\n768\n00:41:37.435 --> 00:41:40.325\nthe air instead of having\nthem wiped out on the ground.\n\n769\n00:41:40.325 --> 00:41:44.355\nSo a major, major event impact.\n\n770\n00:41:44.355 --> 00:41:45.855\nAnother, one Luftwaffe.\n\n771\n00:41:45.855 --> 00:41:46.695\nThey had another one.\n\n772\n00:41:46.695 --> 00:41:50.845\nThis was one that some\npeople have heard of, but\n\n773\n00:41:50.845 --> 00:41:56.220\nit's kind of a fascinating\none that they did.\n\n774\n00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.610\nAs Luftwaffe developed for night missions.\n\n775\n00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.650\nThey developed this technology,\nnight flying and\n\n776\n00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.010\nnight raids were still something\nbrand new at that point.\n\n777\n00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:09.150\nAnd so you didn't see too much of it.\n\n778\n00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:12.498\nI want to say, and I may be wrong, but\n\n779\n00:42:12.498 --> 00:42:17.359\nI think the US was the first\nones that connected really\n\n780\n00:42:17.359 --> 00:42:21.913\nmajor large-scale\nsuccessful night missions.\n\n781\n00:42:21.913 --> 00:42:26.488\nBut the Nazis tried it,\nby the Luftwaffe specifically,\n\n782\n00:42:26.488 --> 00:42:31.732\ndeveloped this technology where\nthey had highly concentrated,\n\n783\n00:42:31.732 --> 00:42:36.403\nfocused radio beams that they\nfire from the mainland, and\n\n784\n00:42:36.403 --> 00:42:40.620\nthey cross over and\nconverge over a spot in England.\n\n785\n00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.490\nAnd so\ntheir planes would just ride that beam in.\n\n786\n00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:47.250\nAnd when they got to the point where\nthe two radio signals crossed, so\n\n787\n00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.430\nthey just dial their\nradio's two frequencies.\n\n788\n00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:51.730\nWhen the two frequencies crossed they\nknew they were over their target,\n\n789\n00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:55.900\nblacked out or not, and they would\njust drop their bombs and return.\n\n790\n00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.970\nYeah, it's very simple.\n\n791\n00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:05.250\nHowever, the British found out that\nthey were doing that by again, by these\n\n792\n00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:10.360\ncodes they got out of Enigma, and were\nable to mess with and jam those signals.\n\n793\n00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.100\nSo they had planes go all over the place,\nand\n\n794\n00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:16.830\nnever can, and some made it to the right\nspot, but there wasn't enough to cause\n\n795\n00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:22.130\nthe scale of damage that\nthe Luftwaffe had hoped.\n\n796\n00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:26.110\nSo there's one you may not have heard of.\n\n797\n00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.227\nImpacted Rommel in North Africa,\nhis advance.\n\n798\n00:43:29.227 --> 00:43:32.870\nThey were able to intercept\nsignals there in place troops.\n\n799\n00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:40.030\nAnother, another significant one that\nhas far reaching impact they use their\n\n800\n00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:44.880\nknowledge of the enigma system in the\nmessages that they could now decode on it.\n\n801\n00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.518\nBritain was able to\ndetermine that they had\n\n802\n00:43:48.518 --> 00:43:52.266\nexpunged all the Nazi agents from England.\n\n803\n00:43:52.266 --> 00:43:55.449\nAnd they were able to do that by\nintercepting these messages and\n\n804\n00:43:55.449 --> 00:43:59.293\nfinding out that the Nazis had gotten\ntaken care of them, either captured or\n\n805\n00:43:59.293 --> 00:44:01.653\nkilled them or\nchased them out of the country.\n\n806\n00:44:01.653 --> 00:44:05.264\nSo that was something that\nthey were able to do.\n\n807\n00:44:05.264 --> 00:44:07.353\nOther ones, the V1 and V2.\n\n808\n00:44:07.353 --> 00:44:08.932\n>> Right, the rockets, yep.\n\n809\n00:44:08.932 --> 00:44:10.180\n>> The buzz bomb and the rockets.\n\n810\n00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.685\nThose were two, the V1 you could\nargue be the first cruise missile,\n\n811\n00:44:13.685 --> 00:44:17.330\neven though it was kind of a dumb\ncruise missile by today's standards.\n\n812\n00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:18.470\n>> Right.\n\n813\n00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:22.410\n>> They got knowledge of that, and\nthey got knowledge of the V2 as well.\n\n814\n00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:27.228\nThe V2 would be extremely significant\nin the scheme of things because V1,\n\n815\n00:44:27.228 --> 00:44:31.667\nit's just they call it the buzz bomb,\nit's just something that was,\n\n816\n00:44:31.667 --> 00:44:35.450\nhad a little pulse jet engine on it and\nit would just cruise.\n\n817\n00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:38.780\nAnd you could catch that, shoot that down\nwith spit fires and super marines and\n\n818\n00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.060\nstuff like that.\n\n819\n00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.640\nWell in fact there were stories of guys\ntaking the wings of their aircraft and\n\n820\n00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.330\njust touching the wings of their aircraft\nto these V2's and sending them off course.\n\n821\n00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:52.670\nTry doing that now if you're\na pilot in the military.\n\n822\n00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:55.350\nThey come in and just nudge it with\ntheir wing tip go, pop all right.\n\n823\n00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:58.220\nThat's what these guys did\nwith some of these things,\n\n824\n00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.800\njust to kind of nudge them out of the way.\n\n825\n00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.310\nBut they could do that, they were\nslow enough that you had a higher\n\n826\n00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:08.780\npossibility of catching them.\n\n827\n00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:13.950\nWhen they did these V-2s, these rockets,\nthose things, you hear it after it's hit.\n\n828\n00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.130\nA building goes up, and then that's it.\n\n829\n00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:20.395\nSo when the Germans were developing\nthese things at Pina Munde.\n\n830\n00:45:20.395 --> 00:45:24.825\nTheir facility where they did all\nthese sorts of development of some of\n\n831\n00:45:24.825 --> 00:45:27.056\nthese super weapons, I should say.\n\n832\n00:45:27.056 --> 00:45:30.741\nThey were able to get knowledge of this\nand go attack those things on the ground,\n\n833\n00:45:30.741 --> 00:45:32.865\ncuz that was the only chance you had.\n\n834\n00:45:32.865 --> 00:45:35.785\nOnce one of the V2s was launched,\nleft its launcher,\n\n835\n00:45:35.785 --> 00:45:38.495\nwith the technology available at the time,\nthat was it.\n\n836\n00:45:38.495 --> 00:45:41.285\nIt was hitting someplace,\nand you weren't stopping it.\n\n837\n00:45:41.285 --> 00:45:45.660\nA building was going up someplace, so\nyou had to just destroy the launcher so\n\n838\n00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.520\nthey were able to use the decoded enigma\n\n839\n00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:52.250\nmessages to find those things on\nthe ground using the same thing.\n\n840\n00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:56.160\nThen the Scharnhorst was another one\nthat was a German Battleship they had\n\n841\n00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.130\nthat caused major damage and confusion.\n\n842\n00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:04.440\nThey were able to get that one and\nthat one I found interesting,\n\n843\n00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.400\nbecause I was looking at\nsomething with the event.\n\n844\n00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.370\nThe British actually\ndestroy the only dry dock\n\n845\n00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:18.010\nthey had to fix that on that coast of\nEurope they could use to fix that.\n\n846\n00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:22.992\nThey loaded a valve ship with explosives\nand just ran it at the doors and\n\n847\n00:46:22.992 --> 00:46:28.058\nthe lock and crippled it and it was\ngonna take at least five years to fix.\n\n848\n00:46:28.058 --> 00:46:32.449\nSo war was that you were not gonna\nmake an impact at that point,\n\n849\n00:46:32.449 --> 00:46:36.333\nso Scharnhorst couldn't go to it and\nget fixed properly and\n\n850\n00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:39.740\nit took a lot of damage and\nwas eventually sunk.\n\n851\n00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:44.733\nAnd then this last one I have on here for\nthat the Enigma break in played a role\n\n852\n00:46:44.733 --> 00:46:48.061\nin was because of the messages\nthey were reading,\n\n853\n00:46:48.061 --> 00:46:52.657\nthey were actually able to find out\nthat the Germans didn't know, or\n\n854\n00:46:52.657 --> 00:46:56.797\njust didn't believe,\nthat D-Day was actually happening.\n\n855\n00:46:56.797 --> 00:47:03.977\nThey were actually able to see all this\nconfusion going on, on the ground.\n\n856\n00:47:03.977 --> 00:47:08.410\nThe D-Day was so well-planned, there was\nso many decoys being put in place and\n\n857\n00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:12.120\nit was hidden so\nwell that they just couldn't believe it.\n\n858\n00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.756\nThey were just complete disarray and\nthey were able to exploit that.\n\n859\n00:47:15.756 --> 00:47:20.271\nIn fact, I think they took advantage of\nthe fact that of kind of when the other\n\n860\n00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:23.466\nones I mentioned,\nthe Germans had broken Ally code.\n\n861\n00:47:23.466 --> 00:47:28.419\nThey actually took advantage of that and\ntransmitted\n\n862\n00:47:28.419 --> 00:47:34.020\nsomething saying that Paton\nwas leading another army.\n\n863\n00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.359\nHe was gonna lead it further\nup the coast in Europe.\n\n864\n00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.920\nAnd the Nazis moved\ntheir forces up there to\n\n865\n00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:46.095\nengage an attack that\nwas never gonna happen.\n\n866\n00:47:46.095 --> 00:47:47.048\nRight.\nThey had Patton.\n\n867\n00:47:47.048 --> 00:47:50.360\nThey had messages that Patton\nwas sending and all that and\n\n868\n00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.571\nthey thought he was gonna go up there.\n\n869\n00:47:52.571 --> 00:47:53.959\nThe Germans apparently,\n\n870\n00:47:53.959 --> 00:47:57.307\none of the generals they were\nvery concerned about was Patton.\n\n871\n00:47:57.307 --> 00:47:59.714\nThey knew that he was\na brilliant strategist, so\n\n872\n00:47:59.714 --> 00:48:03.764\nwhen they Saw he was up there, they had a\nlot of concerns so they redeployed stuff,\n\n873\n00:48:03.764 --> 00:48:06.482\nbut that's just some of the things,\nthat's enigma.\n\n874\n00:48:06.482 --> 00:48:07.891\nAnd that's, like I said,\n\n875\n00:48:07.891 --> 00:48:11.642\nthat's the code breaking that you see\nin stuff like the imitation game.\n\n876\n00:48:11.642 --> 00:48:16.731\nUsing stuff like the bomb but\ndoing brute force attacks,\n\n877\n00:48:16.731 --> 00:48:20.984\nthat just had a major,\nmajor impact on things.\n\n878\n00:48:20.984 --> 00:48:21.602\n>> Huge, yeah.\n\n879\n00:48:21.602 --> 00:48:23.082\n>> We could go on and on, and on.\n\n880\n00:48:23.082 --> 00:48:27.103\nI won't, I don't want to turn this into\na big history class, but I kinda want to\n\n881\n00:48:27.103 --> 00:48:30.782\npoint out that yeah, we broke the code,\nbut what's the impact of that?\n\n882\n00:48:30.782 --> 00:48:34.672\nThat should tell you what type of weight\nthat someone that's a cryptanalysis has\n\n883\n00:48:34.672 --> 00:48:38.402\nsitting on their shoulders, or\npotentially is sitting on their shoulders.\n\n884\n00:48:38.402 --> 00:48:44.271\nI mean, we hope you're not involved with\nsomething like a world warrior break or\n\n885\n00:48:44.271 --> 00:48:49.276\nsomething like that, but\nthese guys can definitely have an impact,\n\n886\n00:48:49.276 --> 00:48:53.011\njust simple mathematicians and\npeople like that.\n\n887\n00:48:53.011 --> 00:48:55.540\n>> Huge impact in the outcome\nof many different events.\n\n888\n00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.450\nThe fact that we were able to break\nthe code, and then also a real good\n\n889\n00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:02.850\nexample of where, when the other side\ndoesn't know you can read their code.\n\n890\n00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:03.899\nHow much they rely and\n\n891\n00:49:03.899 --> 00:49:07.394\nhow much anybody would rely on that\nencryption method they're using,\n\n892\n00:49:07.394 --> 00:49:10.901\nand if somebody breaks it and\nyou don't realize it, you keep using it.\n\n893\n00:49:10.901 --> 00:49:14.981\nYou might as well just holler out\nyour messages out there, right, so.\n\n894\n00:49:14.981 --> 00:49:15.641\n>> Yeah.\n\n895\n00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:18.381\n>> Very impressive, and\nthen you've got be deinst, is that?\n\n896\n00:49:18.381 --> 00:49:21.999\n>> I think it's be deinst,\nit's actually a longer,\n\n897\n00:49:21.999 --> 00:49:27.140\nit's an abbreviation of a longer,\nthat's the one they use in English.\n\n898\n00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:30.826\nIt's the ones that the Germans\nhad during the war.\n\n899\n00:49:30.826 --> 00:49:35.015\nI think, in my mind,\nbe deinst translates into English as,\n\n900\n00:49:35.015 --> 00:49:37.406\nI don't know how to speak German.\n\n901\n00:49:37.406 --> 00:49:38.307\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what that translates.\n\n902\n00:49:38.307 --> 00:49:40.540\nI don't know what that means, all right?\n\n903\n00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.050\nSo, but they had a couple.\n\n904\n00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:43.640\nThey had a code breaking effort as well.\n\n905\n00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:48.280\nI think as much tension and they were\nable to break the British Naval code.\n\n906\n00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.230\nThey had done it way early on.\n\n907\n00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:53.980\nSo, they had that.\n\n908\n00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:57.998\n>> Let's see if I can say this,\nbiel bach tun deinst.\n\n909\n00:49:57.998 --> 00:49:59.535\nMaybe.\nBach tun deinst?\n\n910\n00:49:59.535 --> 00:50:01.691\nObservation service, we'll say that.\n\n911\n00:50:01.691 --> 00:50:03.771\nThat's English, observation service.\n\n912\n00:50:03.771 --> 00:50:04.551\n>> Can I get sauerkraut with that?\n\n913\n00:50:04.551 --> 00:50:06.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't even know what you just said.\n\n914\n00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.630\nI think that was encrypted.\n\n915\n00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:10.005\n>> Yeah, probably.\n\n916\n00:50:10.005 --> 00:50:15.010\n[LAUGH] [COUGH]\n>> But yeah that had a,\n\n917\n00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:19.330\ntheir code breaking effort had broken the\nBritish Naval code and then they had also,\n\n918\n00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:26.950\nthey had used it to coordinate attacks\noff of the East coast of the US.\n\n919\n00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:30.366\nThat's still something that's just\ngetting revealed, believe it or not.\n\n920\n00:50:30.366 --> 00:50:36.020\nThat there were u-boat\nattacks off the East\n\n921\n00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:40.950\ncoast of the United States, and they were\nactually in even the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n922\n00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:46.710\nSo they had gotten pretty far,\nin fact you can find footage\n\n923\n00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:51.720\nthat was taken through the periscope\nof a u-boat of New York.\n\n924\n00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:56.620\nI mean they had a u-boat sitting in New\nYork harbor, so they've gotten that far.\n\n925\n00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:00.870\nInteresting footnote to this is that,\n\n926\n00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:02.730\nfirst of all interesting\nfootnotes to this.\n\n927\n00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:04.980\nCivil air patrol.\n\n928\n00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:09.630\nCivil air patrol got founded about\na week before Pearl Harbor and\n\n929\n00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:14.020\nthey're still around to this day, and\nthey're managed by the Air Force and\n\n930\n00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:17.590\nthey fly different types of air craft for\nsearch and rescue and things like that.\n\n931\n00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:24.195\nBut during the war, they actually were put\nin uniform for them, they weren't members,\n\n932\n00:51:24.195 --> 00:51:27.055\nexact members of the military, but\nthey were flying little things like,\n\n933\n00:51:30.565 --> 00:51:33.805\nstuff like on the scale of cubs,\nstuff like that, or\n\n934\n00:51:33.805 --> 00:51:37.505\nCessna's if you want to call them that,\nthat type of stuff, just think that scale.\n\n935\n00:51:37.505 --> 00:51:39.234\nThose guys actually sunk a couple of subs.\n\n936\n00:51:39.234 --> 00:51:42.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With those things they sank\n\n937\n00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.980\nsubs with the whole thing in there.\n\n938\n00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:45.322\nSo they got credit for it.\n\n939\n00:51:45.322 --> 00:51:47.897\nThere's actually a medal\nsome of these guys got, and\n\n940\n00:51:47.897 --> 00:51:51.618\nI'm still trying to picture that, some\nguy in a Cessna [SOUND] and all right and\n\n941\n00:51:51.618 --> 00:51:54.099\nwhatever, but\nthey were doing that sort of thing.\n\n942\n00:51:54.099 --> 00:51:56.951\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But u-boats did do some damage, sank\n\n943\n00:51:56.951 --> 00:52:01.439\nsome shipping and the other little piece\nof trivia I was gonna mention with that.\n\n944\n00:52:01.439 --> 00:52:05.439\nWas that they sunk a couple freighters and\n\n945\n00:52:05.439 --> 00:52:09.559\nyou never heard about that during the war.\n\n946\n00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:13.458\nIt didn't come out until a lot later on,\nand the reason why, they didn't want\n\n947\n00:52:13.458 --> 00:52:17.439\npeople in the US to panic that there was,\nthat the u-boats had gotten that far.\n\n948\n00:52:17.439 --> 00:52:19.299\n>> The war was that close\nto the US coast line, yeah.\n\n949\n00:52:19.299 --> 00:52:23.134\n>> Yeah, they didn't want to do that, so\none of the sayings that came out of it is\n\n950\n00:52:23.134 --> 00:52:25.979\none that you're familiar with,\nloose lips sink ships.\n\n951\n00:52:25.979 --> 00:52:28.759\nThey told people that knew about it,\ndon't talk about it.\n\n952\n00:52:28.759 --> 00:52:29.379\n>> Right.\n\n953\n00:52:29.379 --> 00:52:33.039\n>> Yeah so, little piece of trivia that.\n\n954\n00:52:33.039 --> 00:52:37.313\nAnd then I mentioned these\non our first episode,\n\n955\n00:52:37.313 --> 00:52:42.629\nthe Japanese code we broke, and\nthen there was another one,\n\n956\n00:52:42.629 --> 00:52:46.260\nthe Australians were doing this too.\n\n957\n00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:50.670\nOnly reason I mention the Australians is,\nAustralians, I love them to death,\n\n958\n00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:53.200\nthey're always characters and\nstuff like that.\n\n959\n00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.110\nThey always have good stuff,\nbut they had a cryptanalysis,\n\n960\n00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:59.520\nthey said, it shows the type of\ncharacters that do cryptanalysis.\n\n961\n00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:04.900\nThey had a guy that was known for being\nkind of moody and said he was a genius,\n\n962\n00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.830\nreally brilliant, but\nhe was kinda moody and stuff like that.\n\n963\n00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:13.380\nBut what he had broken some different\ncodes, even though people like\n\n964\n00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.850\nI said had trouble working with him they\nworked with him because he had the skills.\n\n965\n00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:19.950\nAnd there was the US Army\nat one point said,\n\n966\n00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:22.220\nhey well if you don't want him anymore,\nwe'll take him off your hands.\n\n967\n00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:22.720\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n968\n00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.094\n>> They actually said that and\n\n969\n00:53:24.094 --> 00:53:28.032\nof course we know the US never got him,\nbut they said hey, we'll put up with his\n\n970\n00:53:28.032 --> 00:53:31.000\nattitude, whatever he wants.\nIt's that good, but\n\n971\n00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.950\nthey said he was a real just character.\nHe said he knew what he was doing.\n\n972\n00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:35.970\nHe came with all these unique solutions.\n\n973\n00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:37.301\nUsing the stuff that we talked about.\n\n974\n00:53:37.301 --> 00:53:38.448\nHe was good at math,\n\n975\n00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:42.765\nthey had the logic, had original thinking\nbut had those little personality\n\n976\n00:53:42.765 --> 00:53:46.261\nquirks that seems to go with it.\nHe just didn't play well with others.\n\n977\n00:53:46.261 --> 00:53:47.301\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n978\n00:53:47.301 --> 00:53:50.029\n>> But they said hey, we'll put up with\n\n979\n00:53:50.029 --> 00:53:53.342\nthat non sense, just to, to.\n>> Yeah, take advantage of those skills.\n\n980\n00:53:53.342 --> 00:53:54.002\n>> Take advantage of those skills.\n\n981\n00:53:54.002 --> 00:53:55.002\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n982\n00:53:55.002 --> 00:53:56.931\n>> All of them have these little quirks,\n\n983\n00:53:56.931 --> 00:54:01.092\nand I don't know if it's something that's\nantisocial stuff is something that is\n\n984\n00:54:01.092 --> 00:54:04.107\na recurring theme,\nbecause they said Touring was known for\n\n985\n00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:05.011\nthat too.\n>> Right?\n\n986\n00:54:05.011 --> 00:54:07.461\n>> He was kind of like an antisocial so,\n\n987\n00:54:07.461 --> 00:54:10.443\ninsulated on that.\n>> They would rather spend their time\n\n988\n00:54:10.443 --> 00:54:13.593\nsitting at that desk looking at\nnumbers and things like that than be\n\n989\n00:54:13.593 --> 00:54:16.271\nout at some gala event.\nMaybe, maybe.\n\n990\n00:54:16.271 --> 00:54:18.846\n>> Yeah, yeah, maybe that's what goes with\n\n991\n00:54:18.846 --> 00:54:23.900\nit, but yeah, the Australian guy you\ndon't hear too much about it anymore.\n\n992\n00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:25.610\nTouring you do because you did a lot,\n\n993\n00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:31.210\nhe did a lot of stuff that has relevance\nin computers and technology nowadays.\n\n994\n00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:37.500\nAnd of course the one that they\ncited in the movie which is still\n\n995\n00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:42.570\nthere's still a big political movement\nover there nowadays, you know.\n\n996\n00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:44.530\nNot trying to bring politics into it.\n\n997\n00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:49.710\nIs at the time when they\nfound out that he was gay,\n\n998\n00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:53.010\nthat he was actually had\nclearance pulled and everything.\n\n999\n00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:58.190\nHe was pardoned a handful of years ago,\nand we're not trying to\n\n1000\n00:54:58.190 --> 00:55:02.940\nget in no fight or anything with that,\nor start a controversy.\n\n1001\n00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:03.906\nHe came back in,\n\n1002\n00:55:03.906 --> 00:55:08.952\nhad this resurgence in popularity because\nthe British government finally said yeah,\n\n1003\n00:55:08.952 --> 00:55:13.251\nwell we screwed up, that was stupid and\nthat should never have happened.\n\n1004\n00:55:13.251 --> 00:55:18.146\nSo they pardoned him, and now there's\ngroups trying to get everyone that was\n\n1005\n00:55:18.146 --> 00:55:22.531\nconvicted or tried under those laws\nto have their stuff overturned.\n\n1006\n00:55:22.531 --> 00:55:26.963\nEven if they're no longer with us,\nthey're still trying to do that, but\n\n1007\n00:55:26.963 --> 00:55:31.831\nthat's the other thing that people hear\nabout Touring, but anyway, that's.\n\n1008\n00:55:31.831 --> 00:55:34.118\nThat's that part,\nthat's the historic part,\n\n1009\n00:55:34.118 --> 00:55:37.093\njust want to kind of tell you some\nof the things that can happen.\n\n1010\n00:55:37.093 --> 00:55:41.867\n>> It's amazing to see the impact\nthat cryptanalysis has had in some of\n\n1011\n00:55:41.867 --> 00:55:43.971\nthe major events in history.\n\n1012\n00:55:43.971 --> 00:55:47.189\n>> Yeah, these were the World War II ones,\n\n1013\n00:55:47.189 --> 00:55:52.680\nanother one that's in history,\nto talk about significant impact,\n\n1014\n00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:56.495\nis one I've got on my screen up here\n>> Dan back here\n\n1015\n00:55:56.495 --> 00:56:01.032\nwas good enough to also bring\nthis one into the picture.\n\n1016\n00:56:01.032 --> 00:56:02.634\nSome of you may recognize this.\n\n1017\n00:56:02.634 --> 00:56:03.981\nSome of you may not.\n\n1018\n00:56:03.981 --> 00:56:05.079\nIf you could read it,\n\n1019\n00:56:05.079 --> 00:56:08.741\nthe San Francisco Police Department\nwould like to have a word with you.\n\n1020\n00:56:08.741 --> 00:56:12.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is the Zodiac Killer.\n\n1021\n00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:19.510\nThe Zodiac Killer wrote his stuff in\nan encrypted format, and he made it so\n\n1022\n00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:25.040\nthe first few messages could be decrypted,\nhe left little things out there, but\n\n1023\n00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:29.490\nthe later messages, toward the end,\nthey've never been decrypted.\n\n1024\n00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:33.598\nThere's people still working\non this all these years later,\n\n1025\n00:56:33.598 --> 00:56:36.600\ntrying to figure out\nwhat these things mean,\n\n1026\n00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:41.419\ncuz I believe they actually closed\nthe case, and then they reopened it,\n\n1027\n00:56:41.419 --> 00:56:45.470\nthey said and there's,\nit always comes up every few years.\n\n1028\n00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:49.521\nYou hear something come up saying hey,\nwe know who this guy is, or\n\n1029\n00:56:49.521 --> 00:56:51.518\nthe guy that did it passed away.\n\n1030\n00:56:51.518 --> 00:56:55.836\nThere's someone that wrote a book not too\nlong ago that said the Zodiac Killer,\n\n1031\n00:56:55.836 --> 00:56:57.260\nshe thinks it was her dad.\n\n1032\n00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:59.290\nIt was something, that came out and\n\n1033\n00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:04.340\nshe had a lot of evidence that supported\nit, but it was kind of tenuous at best.\n\n1034\n00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:08.525\nBut, this is one of his letters and\nit was signed with that,\n\n1035\n00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:11.850\nthe letter was signed with that symbol.\n\n1036\n00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:13.680\nAnd so, yeah.\n\n1037\n00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:19.104\nThat's just one thing, but they have not\nbeen decrypted yet, but people are working\n\n1038\n00:57:19.104 --> 00:57:24.096\non this type of stuff, who knows maybe\nthey will some day, maybe they won't.\n\n1039\n00:57:24.096 --> 00:57:27.984\nLike I said, who knows, but\nit's just another case where showed up.\n\n1040\n00:57:27.984 --> 00:57:29.354\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1041\n00:57:29.354 --> 00:57:31.586\nAll right well looking at\nthe clock it's about time for\n\n1042\n00:57:31.586 --> 00:57:34.836\nus to take another one of those breaks\nwe're gonna step away we'll come back for\n\n1043\n00:57:34.836 --> 00:57:37.911\nmore cryptoanalysis and code breaking so\nstay tuned we'll be right back.\n\n1044\n00:57:37.911 --> 00:57:45.400\n[SOUND]\nAll right.\n\n1045\n00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.830\nWelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1046\n00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:51.140\nSo, so far, we've taken a look at\nwhat cryptonalysis is all about and\n\n1047\n00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:56.230\nthen some good examples in history where\ncryptonalysis has had a major impact\n\n1048\n00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:59.410\nin the outcome of certain\nhistorical events.\n\n1049\n00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:02.450\nThe next thing, Charlie, I think we wanna\ndo is kinda take a look at really what's\n\n1050\n00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:05.340\ninvolved in code breaking, right?\n\n1051\n00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:08.310\n>> Yeah,\nwe're gonna look at some examples.\n\n1052\n00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:13.270\nBefore we do that, we need to talk\nabout some of the things that\n\n1053\n00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:17.420\ngo into breaking a code and\nmaking it easier for you.\n\n1054\n00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:21.008\nBecause it's, there are definite things\nthat are gonna work in your favor.\n\n1055\n00:58:21.008 --> 00:58:23.105\nThat are gonna make,\nhelp the process along and\n\n1056\n00:58:23.105 --> 00:58:24.790\nmake things just a little bit easier.\n\n1057\n00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:28.979\nSo, we know those things then, then heck,\n\n1058\n00:58:28.979 --> 00:58:34.774\nmaybe we can kind of speed things\nalong a bit and not be stuck.\n\n1059\n00:58:34.774 --> 00:58:35.993\n>> Right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n1060\n00:58:35.993 --> 00:58:37.160\n>> Chasing our tail or anything else.\n\n1061\n00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.950\nI kinda thought that was one of\nthe comments in the chatroom.\n\n1062\n00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:42.614\nMake something up just to have\npeople chase their own tail.\n\n1063\n00:58:42.614 --> 00:58:43.658\n>> Yeah, right?\n>> Krypto people.\n\n1064\n00:58:43.658 --> 00:58:46.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Very good, Richard.\n\n1065\n00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:50.190\n>> You guys know what Superman's\ndog was named in the comics?\n\n1066\n00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:50.990\nKrypto.\n\n1067\n00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.630\nHe's saying it.\n\n1068\n00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:52.400\nHe's saying it.\n\n1069\n00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.190\nHe's trivia, you know it.\n\n1070\n00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.870\nLook it up.\n\n1071\n00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:54.388\nTrust me.\n>> Nice.\n\n1072\n00:58:54.388 --> 00:58:57.824\n[LAUGH]\n>> So anyway, but yeah, if we know and\n\n1073\n00:58:57.824 --> 00:59:02.306\nunderstand some basic premises,\nthen we can start\n\n1074\n00:59:02.306 --> 00:59:07.560\nreading more into a piece\nof encrypted information.\n\n1075\n00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:11.690\nThere's almost always gonna be\nsome sort of pattern there.\n\n1076\n00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:16.960\nIf you know how to look at it the right\nway, you can usually ascertain one.\n\n1077\n00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.450\nIt may be very complex, and\nit may be a very long and\n\n1078\n00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:25.020\nvery crazy pattern, but\nyou usually can find something.\n\n1079\n00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:29.480\nIt may not be obvious though just because\nof the way things are structured.\n\n1080\n00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:33.445\nIt may require that you\nget multiple cipher\n\n1081\n00:59:33.445 --> 00:59:37.610\ntexts before you can actually see it.\n\n1082\n00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:42.910\nOther things that could help you out\nis just applying a little bit of logic.\n\n1083\n00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:47.860\nAnd logic, one of the things I\ncan throw into this is knowing\n\n1084\n00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:52.580\nwhat the language underneath is gonna be,\nwhat the plain text was in.\n\n1085\n00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:56.565\nJust as an example for that,\nif we look back at the coding for\n\n1086\n00:59:56.565 --> 00:59:59.276\nthe Enigma machine, we sure as heck know\n\n1087\n00:59:59.276 --> 01:00:03.768\nwhen we are decoding that the original\nmessage was not in English.\n\n1088\n01:00:03.768 --> 01:00:04.430\n>> Right.\n\n1089\n01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:07.070\n>> Probably was in German so-\n>> So looking for like patterns or\n\n1090\n01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.430\nyour most common letters.\n\n1091\n01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.660\nYour RSTLNEs and things like that.\n\n1092\n01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.190\n>> Yes.\n>> I'm not gonna help you there if\n\n1093\n01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:16.110\nthe original text, so the plain\ntext was in a different language.\n\n1094\n01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:20.860\n>> Yeah it's, if you have that knowledge\nor suspicion of what was underneath before\n\n1095\n01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:25.180\nit went through the encryption process,\nthat's gonna help you out.\n\n1096\n01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:28.950\nAnd then even knowing\nmechanics of that language and\n\n1097\n01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:31.970\nwhat the original stuff\nwas is gonna help you out.\n\n1098\n01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:37.050\nA good example would be\nsome of these Slovak\n\n1099\n01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:42.038\nlanguages and I want to say it's\nthe Russian language specifically.\n\n1100\n01:00:42.038 --> 01:00:48.249\nI know there's several ones over\nthere don't have the word the in it.\n\n1101\n01:00:48.249 --> 01:00:50.630\nSo if you eliminate that word,\n\n1102\n01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:55.680\nI mean that's a very common word\nto have in the English language.\n\n1103\n01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:00.135\nSo if you're looking for a three-letter\npattern that occurs over and over and\n\n1104\n01:01:00.135 --> 01:01:03.441\nover again, if it's English,\nyou might assume, well,\n\n1105\n01:01:03.441 --> 01:01:06.613\nokay, well, more than likely,\nthat's the word the,\n\n1106\n01:01:06.613 --> 01:01:11.562\ncould be the word and, that's a little bit\nless popular, that's gonna help you out.\n\n1107\n01:01:11.562 --> 01:01:17.771\nBut if you go to the Russian language and\nyou say, that's the word the, well,\n\n1108\n01:01:17.771 --> 01:01:24.725\nthat's not going to work because that just\ndoesn't exist, I mean, in that language.\n\n1109\n01:01:24.725 --> 01:01:27.375\nEnglish language we have, for example,\n\n1110\n01:01:27.375 --> 01:01:31.255\nthere's some,\nthere are single letter words.\n\n1111\n01:01:31.255 --> 01:01:33.080\nI mean, we do know that.\n\n1112\n01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.004\nHow many can you think of?\n\n1113\n01:01:35.004 --> 01:01:36.583\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's the thing,\n\n1114\n01:01:36.583 --> 01:01:40.280\nthere's really only two that you ever see.\n\n1115\n01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.740\nIs I and A, that's it.\n\n1116\n01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:48.809\nIf you think of another one, that's\nnot part of the normal language base.\n\n1117\n01:01:48.809 --> 01:01:53.249\nSometimes you get, O pops up in there,\nbut that is extremely rare, and\n\n1118\n01:01:53.249 --> 01:01:55.948\nyou're probably-\n>> Why.\n\n1119\n01:01:55.948 --> 01:01:57.365\n>> That's W-H-Y.\n\n1120\n01:01:57.365 --> 01:02:03.384\n[LAUGH]\n>> But yeah, only sometimes.\n\n1121\n01:02:03.384 --> 01:02:05.810\n>> Yeah, only sometimes, there you go.\n\n1122\n01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:06.507\nSometimes why.\n\n1123\n01:02:06.507 --> 01:02:07.402\n>> Yeah, sometimes why.\n\n1124\n01:02:07.402 --> 01:02:15.440\nBut, yeah, but in normal use, you only\nhave things like INA as being single ones.\n\n1125\n01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.380\nSo that would be something that\nlogic would tell you well, if I see\n\n1126\n01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:24.463\ncertain things in there, if that's\nEnglish, that's gotta be one of those two.\n\n1127\n01:02:24.463 --> 01:02:31.035\nYou can do the same things in letters, in\nthe way letters repeat, you can see that.\n\n1128\n01:02:31.035 --> 01:02:33.635\nThere's just lots of stuff\nthat you can apply logic and\n\n1129\n01:02:33.635 --> 01:02:37.060\nknowledge to to help you break a message.\n\n1130\n01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:40.280\nSo that's one thing we can look at.\n\n1131\n01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.618\nThe mathematics,\n\n1132\n01:02:41.618 --> 01:02:46.971\nwe're probably all seeing those little\npuzzles in the back of magazines and\n\n1133\n01:02:46.971 --> 01:02:52.238\nstuff like that that you can look at and\nyou can start reverse engineering,\n\n1134\n01:02:52.238 --> 01:02:57.695\nwhat that message was by kind of applying,\nokay well this shifted this much.\n\n1135\n01:02:57.695 --> 01:02:59.629\nOr this has, this has shifted three, and\n\n1136\n01:02:59.629 --> 01:03:01.850\nthis shifted four, and\nthis has shifted five.\n\n1137\n01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:05.460\nSo, if I just keep going on\nadding one more on down the list,\n\n1138\n01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:08.890\nI can figure out what those,\nwhat these are.\n\n1139\n01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:12.110\nYou can do little mathematics like that,\nlittle transformations.\n\n1140\n01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:14.890\nThat will help you out.\n\n1141\n01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:19.800\nI mean, some people tried to do,\nthe actual thing they try to do I think is\n\n1142\n01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.520\nbogus, but they've tried to apply that\nsame type of logic to breaking codes.\n\n1143\n01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.430\nIn the Bible, there's people that believe\nthat if you draw a box of certain sizes\n\n1144\n01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:31.360\naround different spots in the Bible,\nyou can look at the words enclosed in that\n\n1145\n01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.770\nbox, and that gives a clue to something\nthat's gonna happen in the future.\n\n1146\n01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:39.848\nAside from the fortune-telling's\naspect of it, that works in other\n\n1147\n01:03:39.848 --> 01:03:45.371\nareas because now you're talking about\ntransposition type cipher thing.\n\n1148\n01:03:45.371 --> 01:03:49.630\nBut that would be another form of\nusing mathematics and logic to do it.\n\n1149\n01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:50.780\n>> Right.\n\n1150\n01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:55.010\n>> And then a third one would\nbe just social engineering.\n\n1151\n01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:58.923\nSocial engineering and\nknowing things people are going to say,\n\n1152\n01:03:58.923 --> 01:04:01.613\nthings that you suspect should be present.\n\n1153\n01:04:01.613 --> 01:04:05.886\nThe one with Enigma was, we knew how\nthey were gonna close their message.\n\n1154\n01:04:05.886 --> 01:04:07.511\nWe knew that was a common thing,\nthey were.\n\n1155\n01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:11.945\nTold and structured that that's\nhow you closed off messages.\n\n1156\n01:04:11.945 --> 01:04:15.375\nAnd so, with that being there,\nnow you can start saying okay,\n\n1157\n01:04:15.375 --> 01:04:17.780\nthere is known plain text underneath that.\n\n1158\n01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:21.580\nI know what the language is, I know what\nit's supposed to say, now I can just look\n\n1159\n01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:26.140\nfor that type of closing and\nthat can help me reverse engineer the key.\n\n1160\n01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:27.215\nBecause I already know the algorithm.\n\n1161\n01:04:27.215 --> 01:04:29.974\nAnd remember, with the Enigma machine,\nthey knew how it worked,\n\n1162\n01:04:29.974 --> 01:04:31.117\nthey dissected the thing.\n\n1163\n01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:35.908\nThe biggest problem was they didn't know\nwhat combination on the reels would be at\n\n1164\n01:04:35.908 --> 01:04:37.374\nuse at any point in time.\n\n1165\n01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:41.533\nSo what they did was they could\nuse that to say, okay, well,\n\n1166\n01:04:41.533 --> 01:04:46.589\nI know what that text is so I'm just\ngonna go ahead and apply my knowledge to\n\n1167\n01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:51.729\nbreak that so translates to that text and\nthen I'll take those settings and\n\n1168\n01:04:51.729 --> 01:04:55.770\napply it to everything else and\nsee if I can reveal it.\n\n1169\n01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:58.690\nWorks, it worked really,\nreally effectively.\n\n1170\n01:04:58.690 --> 01:05:05.440\nSo that would be yet\nanother one that's built on top of that.\n\n1171\n01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.790\nI mean, so there's plenty of different\nlevels though you can go with even\n\n1172\n01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:11.140\nthe social engineering aspect of it.\n\n1173\n01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:15.240\nSome people, for example,\nwell, heck, we talked about\n\n1174\n01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:20.110\npeople using names of things like wives,\n\n1175\n01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:24.610\nmistresses, children, favorite things or-\n>> It's a lot like trying to crack\n\n1176\n01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:25.560\nsomebody's password.\n\n1177\n01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:29.539\nIf I know a little bit about them and\nwhat they like that might help me get\n\n1178\n01:05:29.539 --> 01:05:34.206\nthe code word that they've used in say\ntheir vigne cypher or something like that.\n\n1179\n01:05:34.206 --> 01:05:36.260\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1180\n01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:40.250\nIt would be things like that, applying\na little knowledge and understanding,\n\n1181\n01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:42.000\nyou know who's sending it.\n\n1182\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.600\nThat can help you out.\n\n1183\n01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.830\nBut you know the passwords,\nknowing what someone might be using.\n\n1184\n01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:51.090\nIf they're a fan of a certain\nsports team or something like that,\n\n1185\n01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:52.206\nthey might very well use it.\n\n1186\n01:05:52.206 --> 01:05:54.282\nYou mentioned the vigne cypher,\n\n1187\n01:05:54.282 --> 01:05:59.110\nthe Civil War when the Confederates\nwere using it, they were losing the war.\n\n1188\n01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:01.770\nThey used phrases like, come retribution.\n\n1189\n01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:05.900\nThey used that over and over again,\nso once we had knowledge of that and\n\n1190\n01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:10.360\nknew that they were set in their ways,\nthey were using that, boom.\n\n1191\n01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.650\nWe just kept applying that same key word,\nand\n\n1192\n01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:17.310\nwe're coding stuff even quicker than we\nwould through a normal brute force attack.\n\n1193\n01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:25.120\nSo there's little tricks like that,\nthat have been applied over the years.\n\n1194\n01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.480\nAnd sometimes they're applied, by the way,\nto get someone to actually break it, too.\n\n1195\n01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.670\nThat's the other thing.\n\n1196\n01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:34.414\nYou've gotta be careful if\nyou're doing code breaking,\n\n1197\n01:06:34.414 --> 01:06:37.945\ndoes someone really want you to break\nthat code, or is it just an accident?\n\n1198\n01:06:37.945 --> 01:06:42.129\nThe one we showed here\nearlier on with Zodiac,\n\n1199\n01:06:42.129 --> 01:06:47.110\nZodiac wanted his earlier\nmessages to be broken.\n\n1200\n01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:49.710\nSo there were little things\nbeing put out there.\n\n1201\n01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:54.670\nThe later ones were designed to be,\nthe game had been upped a bit,\n\n1202\n01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:58.240\nso they weren't as easy to break or\nthey haven't been broken.\n\n1203\n01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.786\nSo we do see that, but understanding\nthose things can help you a lot.\n\n1204\n01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:07.857\nBut, again, another thing to mention is\nsometimes if they're not put in a proper\n\n1205\n01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:10.991\ncontext, you can still code break but\nit makes it a lot harder.\n\n1206\n01:07:10.991 --> 01:07:12.280\n>> Right.\n\n1207\n01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:17.110\n>> Just look at when I was, earlier on in\nthis, in the earlier episodes that I was\n\n1208\n01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:21.790\nmentioning that there's some manuscripts\nthat when all intents and purposes,\n\n1209\n01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:24.460\nactually count as encrypted\n\n1210\n01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:29.480\ndocuments that they can't decrypt cuz\nthey really don't have any context.\n\n1211\n01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:33.210\nIt doesn't fit the normal\nrules of a language.\n\n1212\n01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:37.480\nYou can look at languages,\nmost languages fit certain patterns and\n\n1213\n01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.450\ncertain behaviors.\n\n1214\n01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:42.340\nYou can just look at those and\nsay okay, I can determine by\n\n1215\n01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:46.950\ndensity of certain characters and the way\ncharacters are laid out on the page, or\n\n1216\n01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:52.420\nwritten by hand or whatever,\nI can attach certain significance to that.\n\n1217\n01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:57.540\nAnd that will give me\na clue on which way to go.\n\n1218\n01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:03.031\nThey've decrypted, or started to decrypt\none of the languages I know about, they\n\n1219\n01:08:03.031 --> 01:08:08.052\nwere able to start breaking it by just\nlooking at the way these ancient people\n\n1220\n01:08:08.052 --> 01:08:12.929\nhad written it, and they were trying\nto figure out which way it was going.\n\n1221\n01:08:12.929 --> 01:08:16.552\nThey said, do you read this script\nright to left or left to right?\n\n1222\n01:08:16.552 --> 01:08:19.391\nThey were actually indeterminate because,\nwe've all done this,\n\n1223\n01:08:19.391 --> 01:08:22.474\nevery last one of us has done this,\nyou may not think this is significant,\n\n1224\n01:08:22.474 --> 01:08:26.270\nyou may think it's just being lazy and\nnot attach anything else to it.\n\n1225\n01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:28.720\nOr just being unlucky and\nnot attaching anything to it.\n\n1226\n01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.370\nEver been on one of those things where\nyou're writing a line of text some\n\n1227\n01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:33.950\nplace by hand and then you're like,\nI ran out of space, and\n\n1228\n01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:35.774\nthen you do this deal, and\nyou try to crunch it in?\n\n1229\n01:08:35.774 --> 01:08:37.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not a new thing.\n\n1230\n01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:39.370\nThat's been going on for awhile.\n\n1231\n01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:42.450\nThey were actually able to look at some\nof these tablets that people wrote on,\n\n1232\n01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:46.420\nand were seeing some dude with a stylus or\nwhatever, drawing in the mud.\n\n1233\n01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The same thing, I'm running out of, and\n\n1234\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.700\nthere's no auto-correct or\nanything like that.\n\n1235\n01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.130\n>> Searches on the side, and\nif they did it on the left,\n\n1236\n01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:55.125\nthen I probably read that\ntext from right to left.\n\n1237\n01:08:55.125 --> 01:08:56.834\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you could see which side,\n\n1238\n01:08:56.834 --> 01:08:59.734\nthey could look at some of the stuff and\nlook at it enough and say,\n\n1239\n01:08:59.734 --> 01:09:03.232\nokay, they start nice and-\n>> The letters get smaller and smaller.\n\n1240\n01:09:03.232 --> 01:09:05.610\n>> Yeah, broad proud strokes,\nsomeone could say, oh, damn,\n\n1241\n01:09:05.610 --> 01:09:08.490\nI've gotta squeeze it in,\ngotta little bit of stuff left.\n\n1242\n01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:13.170\nWe do that nowadays when we're\nwriting things on a form or whatever.\n\n1243\n01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:15.880\nApparently, they did it a couple\nthousand years ago, too.\n\n1244\n01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:19.960\nAnd that was one way they could determine\nwhich way the script was going.\n\n1245\n01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.920\nYou started over here with these broad,\nproud strokes, and\n\n1246\n01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.670\nthen they just crunched up over here.\n\n1247\n01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:25.310\n>> I'll be darned.\n>> You were going this way.\n\n1248\n01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:26.730\nYou would never think about that.\n\n1249\n01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:29.449\nWhen someone pointed it out to me\nthe first time, I was like it's obvious.\n\n1250\n01:09:29.449 --> 01:09:31.090\nIt just makes complete sense.\n\n1251\n01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:32.828\nI've done that how many times in my life?\n\n1252\n01:09:32.828 --> 01:09:36.140\nAnd some dude's a couple\nthousand years ago is\n\n1253\n01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:41.220\ninstalling something on his tablet and\nis doing this.\n\n1254\n01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:42.455\nThat's just the little things.\n\n1255\n01:09:42.455 --> 01:09:46.260\nSo you get that but\nthen there's yeah, there's also\n\n1256\n01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:51.810\nin short scenes certain characters appear\nand then how they appear together and\n\n1257\n01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:56.140\nwhat they appear with, you can tell\nif there's a relationship there.\n\n1258\n01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:59.570\nOr if one's describing another,\nyou can tell that.\n\n1259\n01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:02.350\nAnd so\ncryptographers use the same type of thing.\n\n1260\n01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:04.350\nSo you look at linguists\nthat are trying to\n\n1261\n01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:08.130\ndecode some of these older languages and\ninterpreting things.\n\n1262\n01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:11.110\nA lot of those techniques\nare exactly the same here.\n\n1263\n01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:13.699\nCryptography's just another language.\n\n1264\n01:10:13.699 --> 01:10:15.930\nThey're just translating it,\nis really what's happening.\n\n1265\n01:10:15.930 --> 01:10:18.440\nYou use an algorithm to\ntranslate someplace else.\n\n1266\n01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.060\nSo those would be just some of\nthe things that we would use\n\n1267\n01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:26.590\nto actually decrypt something.\n\n1268\n01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:31.810\nSo, not everything, but there's more to\nit, but those would be the core things.\n\n1269\n01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:38.065\nSometimes it's stuff you just pulled out\nof thin air, or happen to get lucky on.\n\n1270\n01:10:38.065 --> 01:10:40.715\nThose things can actually play a role,\ntoo.\n\n1271\n01:10:40.715 --> 01:10:44.720\nBut those are some of the standard\nones that we actually see.\n\n1272\n01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:51.210\n>> And then so we've got the different\ntypes of code breaking that we can\n\n1273\n01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:55.430\nperform and there's certain techniques or\nmethods that we wanna apply or\n\n1274\n01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:57.685\nthat is typically applied\nduring code breaking?\n\n1275\n01:10:57.685 --> 01:11:01.575\n>> Yes, there are different\ntechniques that they use.\n\n1276\n01:11:01.575 --> 01:11:02.714\nI've got some of them here.\n\n1277\n01:11:02.714 --> 01:11:06.992\nSo, we talked about those first three\nbeing things that you could apply in\n\n1278\n01:11:06.992 --> 01:11:08.175\na very broad sense.\n\n1279\n01:11:08.175 --> 01:11:10.275\nWe're painting with pretty\nbroad strokes there.\n\n1280\n01:11:10.275 --> 01:11:12.839\nBut when we start breaking it down and\n\n1281\n01:11:12.839 --> 01:11:18.141\ntalk about specific methods of code\nbreaking, we've got a number of them.\n\n1282\n01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:24.920\nOf course, there's things like just\nsimple flaws in the system itself.\n\n1283\n01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.930\nThat happens with a lot of systems.\n\n1284\n01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:31.878\nYou know Enigma was a good example of it.\n\n1285\n01:11:31.878 --> 01:11:35.606\nDepending on which system you were\ntalking about, which generation,\n\n1286\n01:11:35.606 --> 01:11:39.157\nletters wouldn't encrypt themselves\nunder certain conditions.\n\n1287\n01:11:39.157 --> 01:11:44.520\nAnd the absence of that would tell\nyou that that was part of the key.\n\n1288\n01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.860\nSo, you would see certain things\nlike that, so that was a flaw.\n\n1289\n01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:53.496\nBut then there's other things\nthat I kind of talked about\n\n1290\n01:11:53.496 --> 01:11:58.334\njust a moment ago, but\nwe're gonna put a better face on it.\n\n1291\n01:11:58.334 --> 01:12:03.259\nI've got up on my screen here, I went\nahead and I, just to keep things simple,\n\n1292\n01:12:03.259 --> 01:12:05.137\nI ran a block of text through.\n\n1293\n01:12:05.137 --> 01:12:07.529\nAnd maybe we can zoom that\nup a bit more for you.\n\n1294\n01:12:07.529 --> 01:12:09.873\nI'll zoom it up a bit more for you.\n\n1295\n01:12:09.873 --> 01:12:13.799\nOver here, what I've got is,\n\n1296\n01:12:13.799 --> 01:12:18.180\nslide that up bigger for you guys.\n\n1297\n01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:21.374\nYou can see that's a piece of text.\n\n1298\n01:12:21.374 --> 01:12:22.998\nYou look at it, yeah,\n\n1299\n01:12:22.998 --> 01:12:24.712\nlike I needed to say that\n\n1300\n01:12:24.712 --> 01:12:25.603\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can see that\n\n1301\n01:12:25.603 --> 01:12:26.330\nthat's a piece of text.\n\n1302\n01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:32.120\nThat's what they pay me the big bucks for\npeople is I have that type of skill.\n\n1303\n01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.210\nYeah, I'm crafty, I'm wicked.\n\n1304\n01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:39.115\nSo you've got to stay focused people,\nstuff like that.\n\n1305\n01:12:39.115 --> 01:12:42.740\nWill go right over your head if you miss\nit and if you're not paying attention.\n\n1306\n01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:48.520\nBut I think that's the one I'm\nlooking for, a Voynich manuscript.\n\n1307\n01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.430\nThat may be the one.\n\n1308\n01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:53.850\nAnyway, we'll talk about that\none later if that's what it is.\n\n1309\n01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:58.830\nBut anyway, that's a block of\ntext that we see up there.\n\n1310\n01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:04.830\nIt's one that I just paste\nit into this online deal and\n\n1311\n01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:07.320\njust said, okay go ahead and\n\n1312\n01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:11.680\nuse the standard good old Caesar cipher\non it, shift everything over three.\n\n1313\n01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:18.030\nSo you look at that and, okay,\nwe definitely know it's cipher text.\n\n1314\n01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:24.112\nOkay, so because we can't read it,\nand I know it's English.\n\n1315\n01:13:24.112 --> 01:13:24.742\nI'm telling you that.\n\n1316\n01:13:24.742 --> 01:13:29.240\nThat's what I put in there cuz I happen\nto be an expert on the English language.\n\n1317\n01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.830\nThat's the way I roll.\n\n1318\n01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:36.100\nI look at that, and you can see when\nyou start looking through it that\n\n1319\n01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:39.330\nthere's certain letters that\nappear more often than others.\n\n1320\n01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:46.070\nIf we go through that you can\ndefinitely see Os in there a lot.\n\n1321\n01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:49.260\nWe know it's encrypted but\nwe see Os appear in there a lot.\n\n1322\n01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:54.060\nThere's other things, what did we see.\n\n1323\n01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.730\n>> So\nI'm seeing things like the letter D there.\n\n1324\n01:13:56.730 --> 01:14:00.245\nA single letter D, and we were talking\nabout single letter words in the English\n\n1325\n01:14:00.245 --> 01:14:01.907\nlanguage there's really only two.\n\n1326\n01:14:01.907 --> 01:14:06.852\nI see a lot of Ds so I can maybe assume\nthat that would be an I or an A.\n\n1327\n01:14:06.852 --> 01:14:08.880\n>> Yeah, that,\nwould be a decent assumption.\n\n1328\n01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.180\n>> Yes, maybe I guess.\n\n1329\n01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.110\n>> Looking at that, we're,\nthat's all we're doing.\n\n1330\n01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:15.285\nWe're assuming that that's what that is.\n\n1331\n01:14:15.285 --> 01:14:18.330\nSo yeah, we see single letters in there,\n\n1332\n01:14:18.330 --> 01:14:23.210\nwe see the Os repeating something so\nthat would tell us something.\n\n1333\n01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:28.355\nThere's not too many situations\nin the English language where\n\n1334\n01:14:28.355 --> 01:14:33.509\nexcept under a few specific\ncharacters like Ls you see repeat.\n\n1335\n01:14:33.509 --> 01:14:35.853\nYou see Ts repeat and Es repeat but\n\n1336\n01:14:35.853 --> 01:14:39.640\nthere's not tons of situations\nwhere that happens.\n\n1337\n01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.690\nSo that kind of narrows down\neven with that word may be.\n\n1338\n01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:44.840\nBut we keep going through that, and\n\n1339\n01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:48.950\nwe just kind of see that there's certain\nletters that appear more than others.\n\n1340\n01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:50.905\nWhat that goes towards,\n\n1341\n01:14:50.905 --> 01:14:55.425\nwhat this is building towards is\nif this is the English language.\n\n1342\n01:14:55.425 --> 01:15:00.424\nWhat we have is, with any language\nwe have something we can apply\n\n1343\n01:15:00.424 --> 01:15:03.123\nto it called frequency analysis.\n\n1344\n01:15:03.123 --> 01:15:09.089\nAnd I happen to have, I went over\nthis black chamber site here and\n\n1345\n01:15:09.089 --> 01:15:13.619\nwhat I've got is that graph\nin the middle is a just\n\n1346\n01:15:13.619 --> 01:15:18.498\na distribution of letters\nin the English language.\n\n1347\n01:15:18.498 --> 01:15:21.761\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nzoom that up for you too, so\n\n1348\n01:15:21.761 --> 01:15:24.610\nyou can see that a little better.\n\n1349\n01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:26.093\nHopefully see a little bit better.\n\n1350\n01:15:26.093 --> 01:15:28.844\nBut you can see that they've\ngot A through Z in there.\n\n1351\n01:15:28.844 --> 01:15:30.304\nAnd you can see by looking at those,\n\n1352\n01:15:30.304 --> 01:15:32.850\nyou can see certain letters do\nappear more often than others.\n\n1353\n01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:34.150\nThat's the average.\n\n1354\n01:15:34.150 --> 01:15:39.628\nIt means that you could pick up something\nthat was written under normal rules,\n\n1355\n01:15:39.628 --> 01:15:42.533\nusing the English language you see more or\n\n1356\n01:15:42.533 --> 01:15:46.604\nless a distribution of letters\nthat is very close to that.\n\n1357\n01:15:46.604 --> 01:15:47.976\nThere are exceptions to the rule.\n\n1358\n01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:52.851\nThere could be stuff where there's made\nup words in there that could cause\n\n1359\n01:15:52.851 --> 01:15:55.390\nyou to throw a little curve.\n\n1360\n01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:56.670\nYou could have I mean,\n\n1361\n01:15:56.670 --> 01:16:01.070\none of the ones they cite even on\nthis page is someone wrote a book.\n\n1362\n01:16:03.238 --> 01:16:06.610\nFrench author Georges Perec\nwrote a 200 page book\n\n1363\n01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:09.958\ncalled La Disparition without using\nany words containing the letter E.\n\n1364\n01:16:09.958 --> 01:16:10.842\n>> Really?\n\n1365\n01:16:10.842 --> 01:16:11.434\n>> Yeah.\n\n1366\n01:16:11.434 --> 01:16:14.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can, and\n\n1367\n01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:15.940\nwhat have we learned people?\n\n1368\n01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.515\nYou can always count on the French for\na good time.\n\n1369\n01:16:17.515 --> 01:16:18.505\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's how they roll.\n\n1370\n01:16:18.505 --> 01:16:21.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n1371\n01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:25.686\n>> And that also explains why we get\nthe letters R S T L N E when we're playing\n\n1372\n01:16:25.686 --> 01:16:27.140\nJeopardy.\n\n1373\n01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:28.078\n>> Yeah, or Wheel of Fortune.\n\n1374\n01:16:28.078 --> 01:16:29.377\n>> Wheel of Fortune, yeah.\n\n1375\n01:16:29.377 --> 01:16:33.790\n[LAUGH]\n>> Look at how quickly people like,\n\n1376\n01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:35.675\nno no no, I know what that is.\n\n1377\n01:16:35.675 --> 01:16:38.380\n>> [LAUGH] So, but yeah,\n\n1378\n01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:41.750\nfrequency analysis,\nthere's certain letters that are gonna be,\n\n1379\n01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:46.410\nevery language has certain letters that\nprobably appear more often than others.\n\n1380\n01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:48.980\nSome letters that appear\nless often than others, and\n\n1381\n01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:52.060\nwe can take advantage of that when we're\ntrying to doing our cryptanalysis.\n\n1382\n01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:54.160\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1383\n01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:58.190\nAgain, if you look at this\nletter distribution that I\n\n1384\n01:16:58.190 --> 01:17:02.680\nhad up here on screen, if you look at,\nyou have that A through Z.\n\n1385\n01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.510\nIf you chose Z,\nI mean if you're on Wheel of Fortune.\n\n1386\n01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:10.800\nAnd you chose your letters, and all of\nsudden you threw, let's say you threw Q\n\n1387\n01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:16.120\nand Z in there, and then X cuz you\nwere just having a really off day.\n\n1388\n01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.045\nI'm pretty sure Sajak comes over and\nsmack you.\n\n1389\n01:17:19.045 --> 01:17:22.265\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He'll do that, that'll happen,\n\n1390\n01:17:22.265 --> 01:17:29.130\nbecause out of 100 characters 0.1%\nof the time that's gonna appear.\n\n1391\n01:17:30.190 --> 01:17:33.615\n>> Yeah.\n>> Come on, that was a stupid move and\n\n1392\n01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:37.519\nthen with Q,\nhow often do you really see Q,\n\n1393\n01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:41.874\njust think about how often\nyou see a Q by itself.\n\n1394\n01:17:41.874 --> 01:17:43.410\nThat's one thing.\n\n1395\n01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:47.740\nThat's the logic too,\nas well by the way, is that there\n\n1396\n01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:53.100\nare words in the English language that the\nQ does exist right there out on its own.\n\n1397\n01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:58.010\nBut those are extremely rare so\nyou can rule those out.\n\n1398\n01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:58.700\n>> It's almost always a Q-U.\n\n1399\n01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.636\n>> Yeah, it's always gonna be\npaired up with its buddy U.\n\n1400\n01:18:01.636 --> 01:18:05.614\nSo you're just not gonna\nsee a Q by itself.\n\n1401\n01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:10.583\nSo if you're decrypting something and\nyou see Qs popping up and\n\n1402\n01:18:10.583 --> 01:18:14.790\nthere's nothing next to\nthem that makes sense.\n\n1403\n01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:17.800\nIf there just happens to be an E or\n\n1404\n01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.870\nsomething else next to it,\nsomething other than a U.\n\n1405\n01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:25.370\nOnce, twice maybe you could\nsee that happening if you have\n\n1406\n01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:29.160\na big enough volume of text,\nbut the English language, no.\n\n1407\n01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.050\nQ and U are buddied up.\n\n1408\n01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:35.400\nThey're going to appear\nright in close succession.\n\n1409\n01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:40.870\nRight next to one another, so\nthat's why that would be as low as it is.\n\n1410\n01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:44.432\nSo it's just to kind of to\npoint these things out.\n\n1411\n01:18:44.432 --> 01:18:47.919\nLike you said there's certain, when you go\non things like Wheel of Fortune, there's\n\n1412\n01:18:47.919 --> 01:18:51.280\nreasons why people choose those letters,\nbecause they have the greatest chance.\n\n1413\n01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:56.428\nI mean you look at R,\nS you look at R in here,\n\n1414\n01:18:56.428 --> 01:19:00.004\nlet's say 6% of the time S,\n\n1415\n01:19:00.004 --> 01:19:04.458\nyou've got 6.3, E, 12.7.\n\n1416\n01:19:04.458 --> 01:19:05.659\n>> It's huge.\n\n1417\n01:19:05.659 --> 01:19:08.170\n>> So you see that, yeah,\nthat's substantial.\n\n1418\n01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:10.580\nSo that means you have a bigger\n\n1419\n01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:12.700\nprobability of hitting those\nthan you do the others.\n\n1420\n01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:13.640\nWe're not saying they won't appear,\n\n1421\n01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:18.600\nwe're just saying they're much less likely\nif you're gonna be flipping a coin or\n\n1422\n01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.990\nbetting or whatever,\nthose are the ones that are gonna show up.\n\n1423\n01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:26.570\n>> So frequency analysis,\nbig part of our cryptanalysis.\n\n1424\n01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:29.130\nIt's probably one of the first things we\nmight look at when we're going through\n\n1425\n01:19:29.130 --> 01:19:29.980\nand doing this.\n\n1426\n01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:31.620\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1427\n01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:35.408\nYou're gonna wanna do frequency\nanalysis and just to make it clear,\n\n1428\n01:19:35.408 --> 01:19:39.668\nit appears on the character level, but\nit also appears on the word level too.\n\n1429\n01:19:39.668 --> 01:19:43.589\nIf you look through my stuff here,\n\n1430\n01:19:43.589 --> 01:19:47.916\nif you look close enough on my screen,\n\n1431\n01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:53.055\nif you look at you'll see\nthat I have down here\n\n1432\n01:19:53.055 --> 01:19:57.680\nat the bottom I have KH and then KH again.\n\n1433\n01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:01.425\nI know you see KVL here,\n\n1434\n01:20:01.425 --> 01:20:05.737\nKLV here, I see a KH, a KH.\n\n1435\n01:20:05.737 --> 01:20:07.857\nWhen you're looking closer at it,\n\n1436\n01:20:07.857 --> 01:20:11.401\nnow you're seeing that hey\nthere's a word repeating now.\n\n1437\n01:20:11.401 --> 01:20:13.900\n>> Right.\n>> So I don't know what that word is You\n\n1438\n01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:18.370\ncan might be able to make some\nassumptions, I mean three characters, k,\n\n1439\n01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:20.332\nl, v we said three characters.\n\n1440\n01:20:20.332 --> 01:20:22.040\nWords, which one's the most common?\n\n1441\n01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:22.735\nProbably the.\n\n1442\n01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:24.060\n>> The or and, yeah.\n\n1443\n01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:28.386\n>> So we're seeing that, and for\nthe record, just so you guys know,\n\n1444\n01:20:28.386 --> 01:20:31.266\nto kind of throw a little\ncurve ball on this.\n\n1445\n01:20:31.266 --> 01:20:33.530\nI didn't want to make it too easy.\n\n1446\n01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:38.899\nThis text, it is in English, but\nsome of the words are not normal English,\n\n1447\n01:20:38.899 --> 01:20:43.432\nnot sure if there was something\nthat was outside the ordinary.\n\n1448\n01:20:43.432 --> 01:20:45.405\n>> Great, he's using slang on us.\n\n1449\n01:20:45.405 --> 01:20:47.888\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, basically I'm doing that,\n\n1450\n01:20:47.888 --> 01:20:50.085\nbecause hey, you may run into that.\n\n1451\n01:20:50.085 --> 01:20:51.326\nYou may very well run into that.\n\n1452\n01:20:51.326 --> 01:20:55.482\nThat there's someone's got,\nwords in there that aren't standard.\n\n1453\n01:20:55.482 --> 01:20:58.048\nIt's just a common thing.\n\n1454\n01:20:58.048 --> 01:21:03.552\nHeck, what if this message was something\nthat was like a military message,\n\n1455\n01:21:03.552 --> 01:21:05.189\nsomething like that.\n\n1456\n01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:08.346\nCome on, how often does the military use\nthe funny acronyms and stuff like that?\n\n1457\n01:21:08.346 --> 01:21:09.565\nThat's what they run on.\n\n1458\n01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:13.883\nSo they throw those weird acronyms and\nterms in, and every business has,\n\n1459\n01:21:13.883 --> 01:21:16.825\nit's not just the military,\neverybody uses it.\n\n1460\n01:21:16.825 --> 01:21:18.831\nRight, proprietary terms,\n>> Yeah.\n\n1461\n01:21:18.831 --> 01:21:22.950\n>> That might throw it off or make it\nmore difficult to do your analysis.\n\n1462\n01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:27.140\n>> Yeah, so you get those things\nthrown in and what the heck is that?\n\n1463\n01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:31.567\nBut, I know I told you this\nis the English language, so\n\n1464\n01:21:31.567 --> 01:21:35.610\nI know by giving you that\nhint that's saying yes,\n\n1465\n01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:41.119\nthere's stuff hidden in there\nthat's not a regular English word.\n\n1466\n01:21:41.119 --> 01:21:43.884\nI didn't tell you they were all that\nway just told you a few so, heck,\n\n1467\n01:21:43.884 --> 01:21:46.507\nif you ran into something that\njust didn't transit right because\n\n1468\n01:21:46.507 --> 01:21:49.478\nyou just didn't recognize it and\nyou weren't sure, try another thing.\n\n1469\n01:21:49.478 --> 01:21:52.599\nYou're gonna try enough of it that\nyou're going to see that hey,\n\n1470\n01:21:52.599 --> 01:21:54.714\nthese ones are all translating correctly.\n\n1471\n01:21:54.714 --> 01:21:58.144\nThat one, that word I don't recognize,\nbut it worked over here so\n\n1472\n01:21:58.144 --> 01:22:00.541\nand it worked everywhere\nelse in the message.\n\n1473\n01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:02.259\nSo, that's something that\nI have to figure out.\n\n1474\n01:22:02.259 --> 01:22:03.350\nWhat that word means.\n\n1475\n01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:06.949\n>> So this is where maybe the social\nengineering or the logic comes into play.\n\n1476\n01:22:06.949 --> 01:22:10.485\nIf this is a secret transmission between\ntwo pharmaceutical companies, you know,\n\n1477\n01:22:10.485 --> 01:22:11.546\nor something like that.\n\n1478\n01:22:11.546 --> 01:22:14.983\nI might assume there might be some medical\nterms or something like that in there.\n\n1479\n01:22:14.983 --> 01:22:18.175\nIf it's between two military\norganizations or something like,\n\n1480\n01:22:18.175 --> 01:22:20.611\nI might assume that there\nmight be some acronyms,\n\n1481\n01:22:20.611 --> 01:22:23.469\nthere's military jargon that\nI could throw into the mix.\n\n1482\n01:22:23.469 --> 01:22:25.578\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, exactly.\n\n1483\n01:22:25.578 --> 01:22:30.086\nSo yeah, so that's our just\nkind of our cipher text and\n\n1484\n01:22:30.086 --> 01:22:32.741\nwe'll decrypt it here in a bit.\n\n1485\n01:22:32.741 --> 01:22:36.537\nBut we're just kind of talking about some\nof the things that we can see in there,\n\n1486\n01:22:36.537 --> 01:22:39.539\ncuz if we were to receive this,\nthis is our encrypted stuff, so\n\n1487\n01:22:39.539 --> 01:22:41.483\nwe've gotta start looking for things.\n\n1488\n01:22:41.483 --> 01:22:47.802\nSo we've definitely seen letters that are\nshowing up repeatedly in this cipher text\n\n1489\n01:22:47.802 --> 01:22:54.219\nWe're seeing combinations of letters that\nare the same appear in different places.\n\n1490\n01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:56.075\nSo that tells us something.\n\n1491\n01:22:56.075 --> 01:23:00.579\nYou could also even dig inside some of\nthese words and if you saw stuff like,\n\n1492\n01:23:00.579 --> 01:23:03.739\nin the English language we have,\nT-H is used a lot.\n\n1493\n01:23:03.739 --> 01:23:04.730\n>> Right.\n>> I mean,\n\n1494\n01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:08.489\nthat could be something else\nyou dug in there, and see okay,\n\n1495\n01:23:08.489 --> 01:23:12.560\nwell I see this combination of\nstuff is even buried inside a word.\n\n1496\n01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.336\nSo, I see it in this three\nletter piece over here, and\n\n1497\n01:23:15.336 --> 01:23:17.019\nI see the two letters over here.\n\n1498\n01:23:17.019 --> 01:23:19.179\nThat could be T-H.\n\n1499\n01:23:19.179 --> 01:23:22.035\nYou know,\nbecause I've seen those paired up a lot.\n\n1500\n01:23:22.035 --> 01:23:25.100\nThose are they type of\nthings that you look for.\n\n1501\n01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:29.221\nYou know so you look for\nthose types of things.\n\n1502\n01:23:29.221 --> 01:23:33.691\nBut that's the first part so just kind\nof think about that you know for a bit.\n\n1503\n01:23:33.691 --> 01:23:35.560\nAnd then we'll go through\nsome more stuff here.\n\n1504\n01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.939\nWe'll talk more about this code breaking.\n\n1505\n01:23:38.939 --> 01:23:41.433\nThat's just a little bit of it so\nfar to get your head spinning,\n\n1506\n01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:42.433\nhopefully not too much.\n\n1507\n01:23:42.433 --> 01:23:43.501\n>> All right.\n\n1508\n01:23:43.501 --> 01:23:46.287\nWell, looking at the clock,\nit's about time for us to take a break, so\n\n1509\n01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:48.563\nwe're gonna let you mull over\nthat encrypted text there,\n\n1510\n01:23:48.563 --> 01:23:49.920\nthink about what we might do next.\n\n1511\n01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.418\nAnd we'll let you know when we come back.\n\n1512\n01:23:51.418 --> 01:23:53.334\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1513\n01:23:53.334 --> 01:23:59.696\n[MUSIC]\n\n1514\n01:23:59.696 --> 01:24:01.415\nAlright, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n1515\n01:24:01.415 --> 01:24:05.230\nSo let's get back into our little\nexample we were doing, I think.\n\n1516\n01:24:05.230 --> 01:24:07.790\nWe were doing our methods for\ncode breaking.\n\n1517\n01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:11.180\nFirst one we looked at was a pretty\ngood one, a frequency analysis.\n\n1518\n01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:15.169\nAnd we looked at both the frequency\nof individual letters,\n\n1519\n01:24:15.169 --> 01:24:19.557\nthe frequency of words that might\nappear in that encrypted text,\n\n1520\n01:24:19.557 --> 01:24:25.414\nas well as the frequency of certain letter\ncombinations that might occur within that.\n\n1521\n01:24:25.414 --> 01:24:29.855\nAnd we said it's really based on your\nknowledge of the underlying language,\n\n1522\n01:24:29.855 --> 01:24:34.501\nunderstanding what the original plain text\nwas in is gonna give us that ability,\n\n1523\n01:24:34.501 --> 01:24:35.003\nright?\n\n1524\n01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:37.499\n>> Yes, that's gonna help tremendously.\n\n1525\n01:24:37.499 --> 01:24:41.421\nThat's one of the reasons why\nwhen I was mentioning earlier,\n\n1526\n01:24:41.421 --> 01:24:47.150\ntalking about Queen Elizabeth's guy that\nhelped them get Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\n1527\n01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:49.362\nHe knew five languages so,\n\n1528\n01:24:49.362 --> 01:24:54.471\neven though everything in there\nwas in the old English format.\n\n1529\n01:24:54.471 --> 01:24:58.350\nIt was still this guy,\nby knowing multiple languages.\n\n1530\n01:24:58.350 --> 01:25:02.923\nAt some point when you know five,\nsix languages, maybe even before that.\n\n1531\n01:25:02.923 --> 01:25:05.094\nI don't know, I only know like,\nEnglish and Klingon.\n\n1532\n01:25:05.094 --> 01:25:09.342\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's about it.\n\n1533\n01:25:09.342 --> 01:25:12.974\nBut, when you start note getting and\nseeing multiple languages and\n\n1534\n01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:17.447\ngetting an understanding of them, you\nstart understanding what makes them tick.\n\n1535\n01:25:17.447 --> 01:25:22.806\nSo, in this guys case that helped him out\nbecause he's seeing different patterns,\n\n1536\n01:25:22.806 --> 01:25:26.363\ndifferent languages, and\nunderstands those things.\n\n1537\n01:25:26.363 --> 01:25:31.952\nSo now he can bring that knowledge\nback around to the English language,\n\n1538\n01:25:31.952 --> 01:25:34.664\nand say yes, I see patterns here.\n\n1539\n01:25:34.664 --> 01:25:39.239\nAnd with a sharp mind and\nthe patience to kind of pick through it,\n\n1540\n01:25:39.239 --> 01:25:41.120\nyou can see those things.\n\n1541\n01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:46.120\nI don't know if, when all you out\nthere were looking at my cipher\n\n1542\n01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:50.302\ntext onscreen if you would\nhave initially seen that.\n\n1543\n01:25:50.302 --> 01:25:52.885\nWe have some bright people,\nso I don't know,\n\n1544\n01:25:52.885 --> 01:25:56.478\nmaybe some of you were kind of like yeah,\nI can see it right away.\n\n1545\n01:25:56.478 --> 01:26:00.957\nThere are people who have that talent,\nother people you gotta look at it for\n\n1546\n01:26:00.957 --> 01:26:03.941\na bit, and\nwe can definitely see this and say yes,\n\n1547\n01:26:03.941 --> 01:26:07.159\nthere's some patterns there\nwhen we really zoom in.\n\n1548\n01:26:07.159 --> 01:26:09.563\nThat's what something that's\ngonna be code breaking does.\n\n1549\n01:26:09.563 --> 01:26:13.611\nWe're looking for that, we're looking for\nanything that reappears.\n\n1550\n01:26:13.611 --> 01:26:16.630\nThat will happen even if we're doing\nsomething like The Zimmerman Note.\n\n1551\n01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:21.281\nIf you were to analyze The Zimmerman Note,\nif you really get a good look at\n\n1552\n01:26:21.281 --> 01:26:25.869\nthe thing, you will notice that\ncertain sequences of numbers repeat.\n\n1553\n01:26:25.869 --> 01:26:30.463\nEven though they're replacing a word\nwith a whole sequence of numbers out of\n\n1554\n01:26:30.463 --> 01:26:33.850\na book someplace,\nthose same things are gonna happen.\n\n1555\n01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:36.970\nIf you have the word the being used\na lot and you go to a code book and\n\n1556\n01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:41.900\nthere's a code assigned to that, you're\ngonna see that sequence appear over and\n\n1557\n01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.360\nover and over again.\n\n1558\n01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.415\nSo it still holds up and like I said,\n\n1559\n01:26:45.415 --> 01:26:48.506\nyou just gotta know what\nthe underlying language is.\n\n1560\n01:26:48.506 --> 01:26:53.186\nIf you know if it was English,\nFrench, Russian, you know, whatever.\n\n1561\n01:26:53.186 --> 01:26:56.992\nIf you know that, that will help\nyou ascertain those patterns.\n\n1562\n01:26:56.992 --> 01:26:59.660\nAnd that work, for the most part's,\nalready been done.\n\n1563\n01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:02.060\nYou don't have to to re-do that.\n\n1564\n01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:04.720\nYou don't have to go through and\nfigure out letter distribution or\n\n1565\n01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.154\nword distribution for a language.\n\n1566\n01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:08.917\nSomeone's already done that,\nlinguists have done that for you.\n\n1567\n01:27:08.917 --> 01:27:13.525\nAnd in a lot of cases, that's where\nyou've been shoved into a computer for\n\n1568\n01:27:13.525 --> 01:27:18.147\na statistical analysis, stuff like that,\nfor reading those languages.\n\n1569\n01:27:18.147 --> 01:27:21.548\nSo, we can use the same technology and\napply it to this.\n\n1570\n01:27:21.548 --> 01:27:24.216\nSo that's a really cool thing, so\n\n1571\n01:27:24.216 --> 01:27:28.870\nfrequency analysis does work\non characters and words.\n\n1572\n01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:31.195\nSo that's a big, big, big one.\n\n1573\n01:27:31.195 --> 01:27:32.270\n>> All right.\n\n1574\n01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:35.335\nAnd then some other one,\nflaws that might appear.\n\n1575\n01:27:35.335 --> 01:27:39.835\n>> Yeah, there's definitely gonna\nbe flaws that are gonna appear that\n\n1576\n01:27:39.835 --> 01:27:41.162\nare gonna help you.\n\n1577\n01:27:41.162 --> 01:27:46.335\nAgain there's the Enigma one,\nthen there's, you look at a flaw\n\n1578\n01:27:46.335 --> 01:27:51.333\nwith things like the Caesar cipher for\nmost implementations.\n\n1579\n01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:56.041\nThey are just going to encrypt something\nby taking the whole sentence or\n\n1580\n01:27:56.041 --> 01:28:00.840\nwhatever the message is and just going\nto not encrypt the actual spaces.\n\n1581\n01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.105\nThey're gonna break it up.\n\n1582\n01:28:02.105 --> 01:28:05.966\n>> And so, by doing that now you\nactually know where it begins and\n\n1583\n01:28:05.966 --> 01:28:09.246\nends, so\nthat's one thing you can consider a flaw.\n\n1584\n01:28:09.246 --> 01:28:14.045\nAnd that just also contributes to the fact\nthat if you're trying to pick off those\n\n1585\n01:28:14.045 --> 01:28:19.070\none, two, and three letter linking words,\nthose just stand out like a sore thumb.\n\n1586\n01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:21.843\n>> Right.\n>> I can see you know [LAUGH] right there.\n\n1587\n01:28:21.843 --> 01:28:24.476\nYou know so that helps you out,\nyou know, tremendously.\n\n1588\n01:28:24.476 --> 01:28:26.320\nSo you can consider that a flaw.\n\n1589\n01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:31.260\nThere are some implementations that you'll\nsee people put online of the Caesar\n\n1590\n01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:34.380\ncipher, that actually do\neliminate the spaces.\n\n1591\n01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:39.680\nSo after you do that you get a whole\njumble of plain text that you could read,\n\n1592\n01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.960\nand so now you have to go through and\nseparate the words.\n\n1593\n01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.100\nBut that's easy.\n\n1594\n01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:45.550\nIf you know the language you can\neasily go ahead and chop the things,\n\n1595\n01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:47.710\nor you can read it like that.\n\n1596\n01:28:47.710 --> 01:28:51.960\nBut once the spaces are brought over,\nthat could be considered a flaw.\n\n1597\n01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:57.570\nI mean you look at my cipher\ntext I have on screen here,\n\n1598\n01:28:57.570 --> 01:29:01.440\nyou can very easily tell where\nwords begin and end on that.\n\n1599\n01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.450\nThere's no question.\n\n1600\n01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:05.090\nYou can even tell there's\nseveral sentences there.\n\n1601\n01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:06.750\nI mean even if you know\nthe English language,\n\n1602\n01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:10.260\nyou see the ellipsis set through\nthe three dots at the end of the line.\n\n1603\n01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:13.710\nYou can tell that was some sort of\nphrase that just sort of trails off,\n\n1604\n01:29:13.710 --> 01:29:17.550\nbecause there's something signficant\nwhen you put that ellipses there.\n\n1605\n01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:19.520\n>> Right.\n>> So you know the rules of the underline\n\n1606\n01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.860\nrules of the language you're\nlearning more, and more, and more.\n\n1607\n01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:25.750\nBut if you had taken out all those spaces,\nit'd be much more difficult for\n\n1608\n01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:28.440\nus to see those single letter words,\nfor example.\n\n1609\n01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:32.070\nAnd pick out those repeating three letters\nthat we were talking about earlier.\n\n1610\n01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:34.450\nIt's still possible, but\na lot more difficult.\n\n1611\n01:29:34.450 --> 01:29:36.100\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n1612\n01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:43.000\nAnd just to talk about\nthe frequency a bit, I copied and\n\n1613\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.010\npasted this text into the other site\nto look at a letter distribution.\n\n1614\n01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:55.480\nAnd you can see the letter distribution\nas it stands up to the norm in here.\n\n1615\n01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:56.970\nAnd you can see it more or less.\n\n1616\n01:29:56.970 --> 01:29:58.510\nI mean remember what we said about E?\n\n1617\n01:29:58.510 --> 01:29:59.700\nE was about twelve percent.\n\n1618\n01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:00.710\n>> It really does.\n\n1619\n01:30:00.710 --> 01:30:02.580\nE was twelve yeah\n>> This is dead on.\n\n1620\n01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:07.040\nSo it's saying the blue represents\nthe message that's on screen, and\n\n1621\n01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:10.200\nthe red represents the normal,\ncurve for that.\n\n1622\n01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:13.160\nAnd you can see that there's, yeah,\nthere's some places that vary.\n\n1623\n01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:13.740\nOf course.\n\n1624\n01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:16.430\nWe didn't say it's going\nto be rigidly be that.\n\n1625\n01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:19.100\nBut it pretty much sticks\nto what we expect.\n\n1626\n01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.660\nI mean look Q and Z don't appear at all.\n\n1627\n01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:24.410\nI mean they're saying that's\nwhat we would expect.\n\n1628\n01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:28.220\nIt was only 0.1 percent, so\nthese rules were already been calculated.\n\n1629\n01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:33.090\nWe see that this adheres to those very,\nvery, very well.\n\n1630\n01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:39.030\nSo that's kinda looking at just\na message on how it stacks up.\n\n1631\n01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:44.520\nInteresting thing about it is,\nis that you could take the plain text for\n\n1632\n01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:48.660\nthis message, and you could take\nthe cipher text for this message.\n\n1633\n01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:54.390\nAnd you could paste either one\ninto this tool here, and while\n\n1634\n01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:59.476\nthe distribution will be shifted around,\nyou'll still see the same distribution.\n\n1635\n01:30:59.476 --> 01:31:01.555\n>> Oh.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1636\n01:31:01.555 --> 01:31:02.135\n>> For that letter, that letter E,\n\n1637\n01:31:02.135 --> 01:31:06.175\nwhere it says it appears,\nit's got 13 next to it.\n\n1638\n01:31:06.175 --> 01:31:09.835\nSome of the letters are gonna\nappear 13 times and\n\n1639\n01:31:09.835 --> 01:31:12.535\ngonna have the number 13 assigned to it.\n\n1640\n01:31:12.535 --> 01:31:14.775\n>> Interesting.\nSo we can take the cipher text,\n\n1641\n01:31:14.775 --> 01:31:17.815\nrun that and take and do a little analysis\non that and look at the frequency.\n\n1642\n01:31:17.815 --> 01:31:20.855\nAnd then say, okay, this letter\nin the cypher text is about 13%.\n\n1643\n01:31:20.855 --> 01:31:25.945\nWell, I know E is about 13% in plain text\n>> So maybe that's the letter E.\n\n1644\n01:31:25.945 --> 01:31:27.200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1645\n01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:28.030\n>> Very nice.\n\n1646\n01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:30.680\n>> That's exactly how it would work.\n\n1647\n01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:35.110\nIf I took this cipher text here and\npasted it right in and\n\n1648\n01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:39.860\nsaw this one's tell you, hey, red is\nnormal, and the blue is what you have.\n\n1649\n01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:41.790\nI'm seeing how well that this lines up.\n\n1650\n01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:44.700\nAnd knowing that it's English,\nthat's giving something away.\n\n1651\n01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:49.370\nYou actually have right now by\nlooking at this type of stuff,\n\n1652\n01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:54.760\nyou could go through this message, and\ndo the counting up and all that one.\n\n1653\n01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:59.410\nAnd then once you've done that you\ncould easily say, okay, well the 13%,\n\n1654\n01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:03.989\nthis letter, once I add in and sort out\nall the letters in here, this letter is\n\n1655\n01:32:03.989 --> 01:32:09.020\nthe one appearing 13% of the time, and\nI know eve translate 13/% of the time.\n\n1656\n01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:11.330\nThis is Caesar cipher.\n\n1657\n01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:13.500\nHow much of a shift would I have to apply.\n\n1658\n01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:16.510\nAnd we're ignoring the fact that\nwe know the Caesar's cypher three,\n\n1659\n01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:19.910\nwere just gonna say, what does it take to\ngo from this character to this character?\n\n1660\n01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:24.040\nApply that, and once you get that,\nthen just go right on down the line.\n\n1661\n01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:28.050\nAnd try translating maybe like a whole\nline, and see if that makes sense.\n\n1662\n01:32:28.050 --> 01:32:29.290\n>> See if it works.\n\n1663\n01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:29.790\n>> Yeah.\n\n1664\n01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:34.551\n>> Just like I was,\nJ that appeared 13% in my cipher text,\n\n1665\n01:32:34.551 --> 01:32:38.230\nFG, was it\n>> E, F, G, H, I, J, that's\n\n1666\n01:32:38.230 --> 01:32:42.680\nfive characters, so maybe they're doing\na Caesar with a five character shift.\n\n1667\n01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.010\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1668\n01:32:44.010 --> 01:32:45.370\n>> Hm, nice.\n\n1669\n01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:48.274\n>> And that's just applying,\nand it isn't always gonna work.\n\n1670\n01:32:50.210 --> 01:32:52.560\n>> But, if I took it just off of letter E,\nthat's.\n\n1671\n01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.500\n>> Right.\n>> That's reasonably okay, but,\n\n1672\n01:32:55.500 --> 01:33:00.300\nif you look at other stuff like, N stacks\nup with norm, H stacks up with norm,\n\n1673\n01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:01.970\nA's pretty close.\n\n1674\n01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:06.010\nWe got a ten to eightm, you know,\n\n1675\n01:33:06.010 --> 01:33:10.190\nso ten to cipher text,\neight percent in English.\n\n1676\n01:33:10.190 --> 01:33:12.120\nSo, those are lining up pretty well.\n\n1677\n01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:14.450\nWs dead on, V's dead on.\n\n1678\n01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:18.950\nSo, we see those things,\nwe're like, oh okay.\n\n1679\n01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:23.160\nI've seen enough of a pattern here, so\nlet me try it with those numbers and\n\n1680\n01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.350\nsee what the shift is and\nthen apply it to that.\n\n1681\n01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:27.030\nAnd does it translate?\n\n1682\n01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:29.380\nYou can literally use that technique,\n\n1683\n01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:33.125\nand that technique is\ndefinitely used to break it.\n\n1684\n01:33:33.125 --> 01:33:34.970\n>> Uh-huh\n>> Like I said you guys could have enough\n\n1685\n01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:39.850\nright now, ignoring that fact that it's\nthat shift of three or giving that away.\n\n1686\n01:33:39.850 --> 01:33:42.580\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You can just use this information\n\n1687\n01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.580\nto kind of do a little playing around and\ndecrypt that.\n\n1688\n01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:46.702\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n1689\n01:33:46.702 --> 01:33:50.080\nAll right, what about keywords\nthat we might find in there?\n\n1690\n01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:54.960\n>> Keywords you sometimes you do see\nlittle keywords that will appear.\n\n1691\n01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:58.369\nI mean, the keywords I characterize as\nsomething that's maybe not standard.\n\n1692\n01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:04.160\nStandard English, standard phrasing,\nso it's something\n\n1693\n01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:09.000\nthat is unique to an industry or situation\nyou might be able to drop that in there.\n\n1694\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.720\nAnd say okay I see that up here a lot,\nso I think I know what that is so\n\n1695\n01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:14.550\nlet me try to translate that.\n\n1696\n01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:17.990\nSo people throw around a lot of jargon,\nyou know where it came from then.\n\n1697\n01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:21.600\nYeah that can help you out.\n\n1698\n01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:27.480\nGo a long way towards\nhelping you break the thing.\n\n1699\n01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:33.010\n>> And then we've got our patterns\nthat might appear in here.\n\n1700\n01:34:33.010 --> 01:34:34.590\n>> Yeah, patterns, we've already got that.\n\n1701\n01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:37.200\nI mean heck,\neven going further on the patterns.\n\n1702\n01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:39.450\nIn the English language\nas in other languages,\n\n1703\n01:34:39.450 --> 01:34:42.570\ncertain words tend to appear\none right after the other too.\n\n1704\n01:34:42.570 --> 01:34:45.330\nThere's a high probability if you see one\nyou're gonna see the other one is right\n\n1705\n01:34:45.330 --> 01:34:46.910\nnearby someplace.\n\n1706\n01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:47.810\n>> Right.\n>> And like I said,\n\n1707\n01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:52.010\nall those little rules they taught you in\ngrade school about writing the English\n\n1708\n01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:55.060\nlanguage, stuff like that,\nwill help you out.\n\n1709\n01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:57.160\nI mean if you know,\n\n1710\n01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:03.270\nanother example that might not seem to\nbe significant but it very well can be.\n\n1711\n01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:06.870\nIs if you translate a two\nletter word in here and\n\n1712\n01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:12.480\nit comes out as an, instead of and,\n\n1713\n01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:16.480\nwhat does that tell you about the word\ncoming after it, immediately after it?\n\n1714\n01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.310\nThat does tell you something.\n\n1715\n01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:19.660\nYou may not remember it,\n\n1716\n01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:23.470\nbecause it may be something that's\ningrained into your thinking now, but.\n\n1717\n01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:25.160\n>> It should be a vowel next.\n\n1718\n01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:25.980\n>> It should be, yeah.\n\n1719\n01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:27.310\n>> The next word should\nstart with a vowel.\n\n1720\n01:35:27.310 --> 01:35:28.070\n>> There you go, yeah.\n\n1721\n01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:30.530\nThat tells you immediately that that,\nif that's English,\n\n1722\n01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:34.600\nthat's more than likely is gonna\nbe a vowel in the very next word.\n\n1723\n01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.950\nThat's the rules of the language.\n\n1724\n01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:40.070\nAnd so, just little things like that can,\n\n1725\n01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:42.840\nthose rules can help you\nstart translating things.\n\n1726\n01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.320\nBut if it's not English then that\nchanges it, you know, a bit.\n\n1727\n01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:49.195\nAnd if it's not a native English speaker,\nor\n\n1728\n01:35:49.195 --> 01:35:53.750\na native speaker of that language,\nthat's gonna cause problems too.\n\n1729\n01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:56.966\n>> Yeah, those little things could, if\nthe guys got dyslexia that was writing out\n\n1730\n01:35:56.966 --> 01:35:59.369\nthe secret message,\nmaybe that might cause a problem huh?\n\n1731\n01:35:59.369 --> 01:36:00.471\n>> Yeah, that could do it.\n\n1732\n01:36:00.471 --> 01:36:02.676\n>> If they don't use\nproper grammar in their,\n\n1733\n01:36:02.676 --> 01:36:06.012\nlike in the Zodiac I was reading You know,\nsome of those messages,\n\n1734\n01:36:06.012 --> 01:36:08.830\nand you can just see the guy\ndidn't use proper grammar.\n\n1735\n01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:11.832\nSo I'm thinking that had to\nmake it much more difficult for\n\n1736\n01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:16.124\nthis cryptanalysis to occur when you can't\ncount on some of those rules that I might\n\n1737\n01:36:16.124 --> 01:36:18.790\nuse in a normal cryptanalysis process.\n\n1738\n01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:21.690\n>> Yeah, it's gonna cause your problems.\n\n1739\n01:36:21.690 --> 01:36:24.430\nNow the letter frequency might help you.\n\n1740\n01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:24.970\n>> Right.\n\n1741\n01:36:24.970 --> 01:36:28.880\n>> But\nthe grammar is gonna be off a bit, so\n\n1742\n01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:32.250\nyou wouldn't want to maybe put\ntoo much faith behind that.\n\n1743\n01:36:32.250 --> 01:36:32.880\n>> Right.\n>> But again,\n\n1744\n01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.090\nhow would know until you broke it?\n\n1745\n01:36:34.090 --> 01:36:34.840\n>> Yeah, you really wouldn't.\n\n1746\n01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.050\nYou just gotta try.\n\n1747\n01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:39.750\n>> And, like I said,\nsome of that's not just a bad speaker but\n\n1748\n01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:41.930\nnot a native speaker of it.\n\n1749\n01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:45.590\nI mean, all of us know people like that\nthat came from another country and\n\n1750\n01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:48.357\nto wherever you live,\nisn't just the US, wherever.\n\n1751\n01:36:48.357 --> 01:36:54.705\nAnd they can speak the language, but\nthey still habitually leave stuff out or\n\n1752\n01:36:54.705 --> 01:37:00.090\nthey don't have full command of it yet,\nand that causes things.\n\n1753\n01:37:00.090 --> 01:37:05.502\nI mean, you see people, I've got somebody\nI know back home that is Russian,\n\n1754\n01:37:05.502 --> 01:37:10.000\nand she leaves out words because\nthat's what she grew up with and\n\n1755\n01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.939\nthey don't have the same thing over there,\nthere's no equivalent.\n\n1756\n01:37:14.939 --> 01:37:20.618\nSo even after knowing English and\nspeaking it very well, there's still\n\n1757\n01:37:20.618 --> 01:37:26.874\nthings that get left out because it's\nnot part of the regular thought process.\n\n1758\n01:37:26.874 --> 01:37:31.112\nIt's just a normal thing to see.\n\n1759\n01:37:31.112 --> 01:37:35.209\nSo definitely something else that fits in.\n\n1760\n01:37:35.209 --> 01:37:36.486\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1761\n01:37:36.486 --> 01:37:38.985\nAnd then you mentioned key reuse?\n\n1762\n01:37:38.985 --> 01:37:45.710\n>> Yeah, that one is one that we've\ntalked about it a bit already.\n\n1763\n01:37:45.710 --> 01:37:49.060\nIf you start reusing keys and\nthe same patterns emerge, and then boom.\n\n1764\n01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:54.130\nIf I keep reusing the Caesar\ncipher on multiple messages,\n\n1765\n01:37:54.130 --> 01:37:58.260\nI'm gonna see the same three letter\nsequences, two letter sequences,\n\n1766\n01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:01.010\nstuff like that, appear, and\nI already know what those are.\n\n1767\n01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:05.140\nSo I'm done, I've got the key for\nthat, I can just break it right away.\n\n1768\n01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:08.967\nSo, that's just some of the little tricks.\n\n1769\n01:38:08.967 --> 01:38:15.516\nBut to kind of break the mystery\non what was going on here,\n\n1770\n01:38:15.516 --> 01:38:23.110\nlet me put up on the screen here\nwhat the plain text message is.\n\n1771\n01:38:23.110 --> 01:38:26.010\nDid you guys really think you\nwere gonna get out of this class\n\n1772\n01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:26.892\nwithout a Zelda reference or two?\n\n1773\n01:38:26.892 --> 01:38:28.945\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or three, four, or a few dozen?\n\n1774\n01:38:28.945 --> 01:38:32.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But what this is is,\n\n1775\n01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.191\nI went way too far.\n\n1776\n01:38:35.191 --> 01:38:39.403\nBut anyway,\nthis is the plain text message.\n\n1777\n01:38:39.403 --> 01:38:44.402\nAll I did was,\nI just wanted to get a bunch of text, and\n\n1778\n01:38:44.402 --> 01:38:50.310\nI was trying to type one in and\nI was like, I don't want to type.\n\n1779\n01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:51.620\n>> I'm gonna copy and paste.\n>> Yeah, I just said, what can I do?\n\n1780\n01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:53.050\nThat looks interesting.\nI put this in there and\n\n1781\n01:38:53.050 --> 01:38:57.421\nI chose this one because all of you\ncan read this, some of the words,\n\n1782\n01:38:57.421 --> 01:39:01.869\nyou look at some of these things\nlike unless you've played the game,\n\n1783\n01:39:01.869 --> 01:39:05.690\nstuff like Hyrule isn't\ngonna make sense to you.\n\n1784\n01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:10.894\nIf you play the game you'll know what that\nmeans, but it doesn't have any context.\n\n1785\n01:39:10.894 --> 01:39:13.530\nThat would count as a keyword.\n\n1786\n01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:20.600\nSo if you go back to the cipher\ntext on this, you'll\n\n1787\n01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:25.200\nsee a sequence of characters in there, but\nwhen you translate it won't make sense.\n\n1788\n01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.460\nBut then look at the other stuff here.\n\n1789\n01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:27.780\nSo we ignore the Hyrule part.\n\n1790\n01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:28.900\nThat's a keyword.\n\n1791\n01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:34.060\nWe will have to go someplace else, because\nwe'll assume we don't know that word.\n\n1792\n01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:36.630\nSo we can't tell if it's correct or not.\n\n1793\n01:39:36.630 --> 01:39:39.885\nBut if we go to the other ones, remember,\nlike, you were pointing out the D up here.\n\n1794\n01:39:39.885 --> 01:39:40.455\n>> Yes.\n\n1795\n01:39:40.455 --> 01:39:44.015\n>> Okay, well, look, you can more or\nless point out where-\n\n1796\n01:39:44.015 --> 01:39:44.553\n>> Turns out it was the letter A.\n\n1797\n01:39:44.553 --> 01:39:47.085\n>> Yeah,\nyou can point out exactly where it was.\n\n1798\n01:39:47.085 --> 01:39:52.205\nYou saw a D in there several times, well,\nthere it is, A, several places in here.\n\n1799\n01:39:52.205 --> 01:39:55.695\n>> The three letter word, it was and\nand the are both in there.\n\n1800\n01:39:55.695 --> 01:39:56.850\nBoy kinda threw us off, though.\n\n1801\n01:39:56.850 --> 01:39:57.883\nWe saw that a few times.\n\n1802\n01:39:57.883 --> 01:39:58.719\n>> Yeah.\n\n1803\n01:39:58.719 --> 01:39:59.417\n>> Yeah.\n\n1804\n01:39:59.417 --> 01:40:02.447\n>> Yeah, so that's what you can expect.\n\n1805\n01:40:02.447 --> 01:40:07.569\nYou can expect something like that when\nyou're trying to translate a message\n\n1806\n01:40:07.569 --> 01:40:12.531\nlike this, is that there's gonna be\nsome things that just remain a mystery\n\n1807\n01:40:12.531 --> 01:40:17.414\nuntil you've broken maybe some of these\nother ones, that may very well be\n\n1808\n01:40:17.414 --> 01:40:22.180\nsomething completely uninteresting\nthat you break the message with.\n\n1809\n01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:27.150\nYou might be breaking the word the, and\nand, and time, and stuff like that, but\n\n1810\n01:40:27.150 --> 01:40:32.670\nonce you can consistently break those and\nyou feel confident in what you're doing,\n\n1811\n01:40:32.670 --> 01:40:35.640\nthen you can start applying that\nknowledge to everything else.\n\n1812\n01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:42.380\nSo you may only get a peek of\nsomething that looks uninteresting and\n\n1813\n01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:47.330\nplain, but that's your foot in\nthe door to break the rest of it.\n\n1814\n01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:53.240\nSo we did, granted,\non a simple piece of ciphertext.\n\n1815\n01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.160\nHopefully now, you can start seeing\nhow we were dissecting it and\n\n1816\n01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.800\nlooking at it a bit more.\n\n1817\n01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:02.937\nYou could kinda start to see how\nyou would actually break something.\n\n1818\n01:41:02.937 --> 01:41:07.606\nSo kind of an interesting little thing.\n\n1819\n01:41:07.606 --> 01:41:08.663\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1820\n01:41:08.663 --> 01:41:13.552\n>> And I can go back and\nencrypt it now and you can see,\n\n1821\n01:41:13.552 --> 01:41:18.640\nwell heck, there's my text, that's Hyrule.\n\n1822\n01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:21.520\nOkay, well, I can see it again over here.\n\n1823\n01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:25.560\nSo I know that keyword's\nused twice in that message.\n\n1824\n01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:33.140\nBut this is also prime example,\nby the way, of a system that's got a flaw.\n\n1825\n01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:34.898\nThe Caesar cipher doesn't have this flaw.\n\n1826\n01:41:34.898 --> 01:41:36.477\nIt's not called out for.\n\n1827\n01:41:36.477 --> 01:41:42.910\nThe person that coded the site just\nbuilt this, so this is part of their,\n\n1828\n01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:48.050\nI'm not trying to pick on it,\ntheir failings on it.\n\n1829\n01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:51.400\nBut if you look at the word Hyrule,\n\n1830\n01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:56.280\nHyrule is a formal name of\na place in the Zelda series.\n\n1831\n01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:00.190\nBut you look at that word in this,\n\n1832\n01:42:00.190 --> 01:42:05.390\nyou should be able to attach significance\nto that just by looking at that on screen.\n\n1833\n01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:07.150\n>> It's got that uppercase\nletter it begins with.\n\n1834\n01:42:07.150 --> 01:42:08.200\n>> Exactly.\n>> And it's not the beginning\n\n1835\n01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:08.970\nof a sentence.\n\n1836\n01:42:08.970 --> 01:42:12.651\n>> Yeah,\nthat's a formal name of something.\n\n1837\n01:42:12.651 --> 01:42:16.184\nSo if you were given this,\nyou're looking at that saying,\n\n1838\n01:42:16.184 --> 01:42:20.550\nI don't know what it is, but\nI know it's the name of something.\n\n1839\n01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:25.060\nSo that's attached additional\nsignificance to that word.\n\n1840\n01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:29.760\nI've got some formal name in here,\nbecause it's in uppercase.\n\n1841\n01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.490\nI know that's the law of the land\n\n1842\n01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:36.982\nis that you put something in uppercase\nwhen it refers to that type of situation.\n\n1843\n01:42:36.982 --> 01:42:42.900\nSo someone hasn't played their cards\nclose enough to their chest to hide that.\n\n1844\n01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:45.423\nSo that's a gimme right there.\n\n1845\n01:42:45.423 --> 01:42:47.013\n>> Mm, very good, very good.\n\n1846\n01:42:47.013 --> 01:42:49.365\n>> So\nI don't know if anyone noticed that, but\n\n1847\n01:42:49.365 --> 01:42:53.062\nthat's something that you can also\nfactor into this whole picture.\n\n1848\n01:42:53.062 --> 01:42:53.921\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1849\n01:42:53.921 --> 01:42:58.548\n>> I just think this is cool, maybe\nit's just me being nerdy and all that.\n\n1850\n01:42:58.548 --> 01:42:59.621\n>> Fascinating.\n\n1851\n01:42:59.621 --> 01:43:02.360\n[LAUGH]\n>> But like I said, hopefully just\n\n1852\n01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:06.730\nthat little walk-through of this\nciphertext we've been seeing all week,\n\n1853\n01:43:06.730 --> 01:43:11.234\nhopefully just looking at it like this and\nlooking at it with a new set of eyes and\n\n1854\n01:43:11.234 --> 01:43:14.988\nbeing pointed out some stuff,\nmaybe it'll help you when you look\n\n1855\n01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:19.115\nat ciphertext down the road if you\never do this as a puzzle or something.\n\n1856\n01:43:19.115 --> 01:43:21.350\nYou might just only do it as puzzles.\n\n1857\n01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:23.323\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You'll see these things, going,\n\n1858\n01:43:23.323 --> 01:43:24.475\noh yeah, now I see it.\n\n1859\n01:43:24.475 --> 01:43:28.480\nThe lights have been turned on a bit\nmore and now I can see other stuff.\n\n1860\n01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.666\nEven outside of what I taught you here,\n\n1861\n01:43:30.666 --> 01:43:35.106\nyou'll see other things that are those\nlittle clues that the trained eye sees,\n\n1862\n01:43:35.106 --> 01:43:38.085\nbut everyone else looks at and\nsays, whatever.\n\n1863\n01:43:38.085 --> 01:43:39.850\n>> Exactly.\n>> So you're being a little bit of\n\n1864\n01:43:39.850 --> 01:43:40.788\na detective here.\n\n1865\n01:43:40.788 --> 01:43:44.992\nYou gotta train your eye, you're learning\nhabits, and getting yourself developed.\n\n1866\n01:43:44.992 --> 01:43:47.152\nAnd then boom, there you go.\n\n1867\n01:43:47.152 --> 01:43:47.872\n>> You know obviously,\n\n1868\n01:43:47.872 --> 01:43:51.962\nexperience is something that can make this\ncryptanalysis a little bit easier for us.\n\n1869\n01:43:51.962 --> 01:43:56.126\nAnd there's a couple other things that\ncan cryptanalysis easier as well, right?\n\n1870\n01:43:56.126 --> 01:43:58.246\nLike single letter words we talked about.\n\n1871\n01:43:58.246 --> 01:44:00.492\n>> Yep.\nSingle letter words,\n\n1872\n01:44:00.492 --> 01:44:03.500\njust overall distribution of words.\n\n1873\n01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:06.972\nThere's various things that you'll notice\n\n1874\n01:44:06.972 --> 01:44:10.362\nare in Every language\nthat can help you out.\n\n1875\n01:44:10.362 --> 01:44:16.298\nEvery language has it, and\nI know we've got here in the audience,\n\n1876\n01:44:16.298 --> 01:44:19.700\nwe've got people all over the place.\n\n1877\n01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:24.126\nSo all of you can look at your language\nand look at the very rules and\n\n1878\n01:44:24.126 --> 01:44:26.863\nstuff you were taught in grade school and\n\n1879\n01:44:26.863 --> 01:44:31.130\nsee the mechanics of the language and\nhow it's constructed and\n\n1880\n01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:35.670\nthen you can see other little things\nthat you may not have learned.\n\n1881\n01:44:35.670 --> 01:44:38.526\nWe did not learn word\ndistribution in grade school.\n\n1882\n01:44:38.526 --> 01:44:42.640\nThis is something that you'll learn later\non down the road but it's something\n\n1883\n01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.570\nthat is very helpful, someone's done,\na linguist has done for us.\n\n1884\n01:44:46.570 --> 01:44:48.890\nSo we're seeing that and oh, hey.\n\n1885\n01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:50.710\nLet there be light.\n\n1886\n01:44:50.710 --> 01:44:51.476\n>> Exactly.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1887\n01:44:51.476 --> 01:44:52.820\n>> I got it.\n\n1888\n01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:57.590\nSo it's a cool thing, and like I said,\nhopefully you can see this thing with\n\n1889\n01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:59.700\na new set of eyes,\nwhen you see it in the future,\n\n1890\n01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:03.230\nit's not just a scramble of stuff and\noh, man, how am I gonna get this?\n\n1891\n01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.760\nHow am I gonna brute force it?\n\n1892\n01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:06.420\nWe don't have to brute force this now.\n\n1893\n01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:08.160\n>> Now we know where to start.\n\n1894\n01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:12.280\n>> You've definitely got enough clues\nthere to have an educated starting point\n\n1895\n01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:16.150\ninstead of just oh, I'm just gonna throw\neverything at it until something sticks.\n\n1896\n01:45:16.150 --> 01:45:17.410\n>> My favorite method.\n\n1897\n01:45:17.410 --> 01:45:21.220\n[LAUGH] All right, a lot of great\ninformation in today's episode.\n\n1898\n01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:24.680\nI mean, we took you through basically\nthe crypt analysis process,\n\n1899\n01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:27.470\nwhat somebody would do if their job or\n\n1900\n01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:31.800\ntheir role was to do crypt analysis and\ntry to do break code.\n\n1901\n01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:34.470\nSo Sean, anything else you want to\nthrow in before we wrap this up?\n\n1902\n01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:37.720\n>> Nothing really specific.\n\n1903\n01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:41.410\nWhat I would tell you guys\nit's a good brain teaser and\n\n1904\n01:45:41.410 --> 01:45:45.100\na good kind of way to exercise\nthe grey matter from time to time.\n\n1905\n01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:47.880\nYou could try this yourself just,\n\n1906\n01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.020\nyou could have someone, a family member or\nsomething, go to a website like this and\n\n1907\n01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:57.860\nthrow some random phrase or\ncopy and paste something in there.\n\n1908\n01:45:57.860 --> 01:46:02.930\nAnd then just try to let the old\ngrey matter analyze this stuff.\n\n1909\n01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:06.445\nThat really is kind of a good way\nto exercise your brain, I found.\n\n1910\n01:46:06.445 --> 01:46:12.310\nAnd get things moving because it\nteaches you to pick up little clues and\n\n1911\n01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:14.620\ndetails and see different things.\n\n1912\n01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:17.500\nAnd you can use that once your brain\nis exercised with that you find that\n\n1913\n01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:20.050\nyou're more alert and\nstart picking up stuff and other things,\n\n1914\n01:46:20.050 --> 01:46:21.860\nyou become like kind of hyper alert.\n\n1915\n01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:26.140\nSo that's something I've noticed and\nits a fun thing too.\n\n1916\n01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:28.990\nJust to kind to get a little\nmental gymnastics to do once and\n\n1917\n01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:30.700\nawhile so just something.\n\n1918\n01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:32.880\nYou may play it,\nmaybe try it as a game now and then.\n\n1919\n01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.830\n>> That'll keep the brain limber.\n\n1920\n01:46:34.830 --> 01:46:38.230\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed today's show.\n\n1921\n01:46:38.230 --> 01:46:40.059\nRemember, if you've got\na question during the show,\n\n1922\n01:46:40.059 --> 01:46:41.981\nall you have to do is type it\ninto the chat room down there.\n\n1923\n01:46:41.981 --> 01:46:45.680\nWe're gonna see it, and\nwe're gonna respond to it live on air.\n\n1924\n01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:47.500\nIf you've got a question\nwatching the

00:00:35.130\nGood morning, good afternoon,\ngood evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.910\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.670\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.960\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.780\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n9\n00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.400\nHow about you?\n\n10\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.530\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.720\nAnother exciting episode\nin our cryptography series.\n\n12\n00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.470\nAnd in this one, we're gonna take a look\nat PKI or public key infrastructure and\n\n13\n00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.710\nthe way it fits into\nthe world of cryptography.\n\n14\n00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.620\n>> Yes, PKI is something that\nwe kind of alluded to it.\n\n15\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.050\nWe just didn't really bring it\ninto the discussion too much.\n\n16\n00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.340\nBut now's the time to kinda\nbring in the discussion.\n\n17\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.060\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're not gonna\ntalk about it in the depth you might\n\n18\n00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.140\nget when you're talking about setting\nup the whole certificate services and\n\n19\n00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.300\nsomething like Windows server product or\nLinux or Unix or wherever.\n\n20\n00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.000\nWe're more looking at it from the angle of\nwhere does cryptography fit in with this,\n\n21\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.620\nthe significance of that?\n\n22\n00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.460\nAnd how it works and\nhow the cryptography unfolds in there?\n\n23\n00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.220\nAnd then some application.\n\n24\n00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.050\nIt plays a key role in.\n\n25\n00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.530\nSo really cool stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.200\nBut this is just to maybe look at it from\na different angle than you're used to,\n\n27\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.960\ncuz most of us have probably\nset it up at some point.\n\n28\n00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.990\nBut just kind of going through\nthe Wizard and what have you.\n\n29\n00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.420\nAnd then boom, it's set up.\n\n30\n00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.380\nAnd let's get some certificates out.\n\n31\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.470\nAnd that's about it.\n\n32\n00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.050\nBut we're gonna attack it from\nsay like a different viewpoint.\n\n33\n00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.340\n>> So we'll start off talking about just\nwhat is PKI or public key infrastructure?\n\n34\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.293\nAnd as Sean mentioned,\nif you're unfamiliar with public key\n\n35\n00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.584\ninfrastructure or PKI, go take a look\nat some of our other episodes,\n\n36\n00:02:10.584 --> 00:02:13.880\nparticularly our server episodes for\nour Windows Server 2012,\n\n37\n00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.280\nwhere we go through\nthe process of setting it up.\n\n38\n00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.714\nBut we should have a good\nunderstanding of PKI.\n\n39\n00:02:18.714 --> 00:02:22.500\nPublic key infrastructures really are all\nthe different components that allow us to\n\n40\n00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.010\nmanage those digital certificates\nthroughout their lifetime, issuing them,\n\n41\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.790\nmanaging and maintaining them,\nrevoking them when necessary,\n\n42\n00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.940\nrenewing them when necessary.\n\n43\n00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.140\nSo it's really all the different\npieces involved in that process.\n\n44\n00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.898\nAnd remember, the thing is\nthe certificate, digital or electronic\n\n45\n00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:45.710\ndocument that's proving your identity, but\nalso tying your identity to the key pair.\n\n46\n00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.060\nWe've talked about asymmetric encryption\nalgorithms and then we get a key pair.\n\n47\n00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.480\nWe have two different keys,\na public key and a private key.\n\n48\n00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.910\nWhere do we get those?\n\n49\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.530\nI didn't go down to the hardware store and\nsay,\n\n50\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.260\nhey can I get a copy of a public key or\na private key.\n\n51\n00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.550\nWe need something that generates those and\n\n52\n00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.680\npublic key infrastructure is one\nof the things that can do that.\n\n53\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.130\n>> Yes, it does a whole lot.\n\n54\n00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.222\nThere's just so\n\n55\n00:03:11.222 --> 00:03:15.670\nmany things that it's embedded into\nthat you just may not realize.\n\n56\n00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.090\nIt's embedded into or it's an integral\npart of stuff like eCommerce.\n\n57\n00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.510\nBecause that ain't happening\nwithout something like PKI.\n\n58\n00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.960\nWe have different forms of file exchange\nwith encryption that fits them there.\n\n59\n00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.280\nSTL, TLS come to mind.\n\n60\n00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.050\nThen there's VPN, there's IP sack.\n\n61\n00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.050\nYou could keep going on and on.\n\n62\n00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.410\nDigital signatures are a big user of this.\n\n63\n00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.740\nAnd you get even those\nidentity cards that they\n\n64\n00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.620\nuse in some government organizations\nthat have the chip in them, and\n\n65\n00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.450\nthey store certificates on it or\nkeys and certificates on it.\n\n66\n00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.960\nSo there's a broad range of\nthings that use this technology.\n\n67\n00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.720\nAnd they use it in different ways,\nbut the primary thing is that yes\n\n68\n00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.710\nit was generating key pairs and\nthen tying one of those keys,\n\n69\n00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.330\nbeing the public key, tying it back to\nan identity through a digital certificate.\n\n70\n00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.860\nAnd so it can not only create that,\nit can validate, revoke it, manage it.\n\n71\n00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.840\nThere's the whole things\nthat go with that.\n\n72\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.670\nPKI is not, so we're clear about it,\n\n73\n00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.630\nit's not something that you just\nset up for the sake of setting up.\n\n74\n00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.800\nIt's not one of those things.\n\n75\n00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.607\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's something\n\n76\n00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:34.530\nthat you set up to be used in\none of these other things.\n\n77\n00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.590\nIt doesn't really do anything by itself.\n\n78\n00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.000\nIf there's not something actively engaging\nit, it just sits there and takes up space.\n\n79\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.960\n>> Really need to have some reason\nto set up public infrastructure.\n\n80\n00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.331\nThere are a lot of different pieces and\nparts typically that make up the PKI or\n\n81\n00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:53.420\npublic key infrastructure.\n\n82\n00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.810\nBig one being what we call\na certificate authority.\n\n83\n00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.207\nThat's the server, the machine or\nthe device that's actually issuing,\n\n84\n00:05:00.207 --> 00:05:04.760\ngenerating and then issuing these\ncertificates and these public key pairs.\n\n85\n00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.395\n>> Yeah exactly, that's all it is is\njust something that acts as the main\n\n86\n00:05:09.395 --> 00:05:11.920\nauthority for that's, it's name.\n\n87\n00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.244\nIt takes the role of creating the key\npairs, the certificates that go with it,\n\n88\n00:05:17.244 --> 00:05:21.841\nand then being the reference point\nwhere people can go to to validate\n\n89\n00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:26.140\nsomething when they are,\nvalidate whatever operation.\n\n90\n00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.896\nWhen someone gives them something\nthat says hey, you don't know me, but\n\n91\n00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:34.076\nthere's somebody else out here that knows\nme that you happen to trust as well, and\n\n92\n00:05:34.076 --> 00:05:35.120\nyou can go ask them.\n\n93\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.742\nAnd then you pull the certificate, and\n\n94\n00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:41.650\ngo though the validation process and\nall that good stuff.\n\n95\n00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.130\nSo that's what a certificate authority is,\nand then there's different levels of that.\n\n96\n00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.000\nAnd then there's\nregistration authorities and\n\n97\n00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.380\nall sorts of things that come into play.\n\n98\n00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.360\n>> Yeah, you can kind of break it\nup into individual components.\n\n99\n00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.420\nAnd depending, like in a Windows\nenvironment, the registration authority\n\n100\n00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.600\nand the certificate authority\nare typically the same thing.\n\n101\n00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.910\nBut when we talk about it logically,\nthey are individual components.\n\n102\n00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.630\nAnd one of the primary things that\nit has to do is identify you.\n\n103\n00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.400\nWe have to prove, I can't just go and get\na certificate that says, I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n104\n00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.645\nBecause they're gonna wanna make sure that\nI truly am Sean Oriyano before they issue\n\n105\n00:06:16.645 --> 00:06:21.217\nthat certificate whether that's and again,\nwe're not gonna dive into PKI completely.\n\n106\n00:06:21.217 --> 00:06:25.312\nBut whether that's a public certificate\nserver, certificate authority or\n\n107\n00:06:25.312 --> 00:06:27.958\na private or\nan internal certificate authority,\n\n108\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.864\nthat verification has to be there\nbecause really, when comes down to it,\n\n109\n00:06:31.864 --> 00:06:35.480\npublic key infrastructure,\nPKI, it's all based on trust.\n\n110\n00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.100\nYou have to trust the issuing party.\n\n111\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.520\nIf I don't trust the person that\nthe certificate came from or whoever\n\n112\n00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.770\nthe issuing authority was, I should say,\nthen I'm not gonna trust the certificate.\n\n113\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.350\nIf you think about like SSL, and\nme going to Bank of America and\n\n114\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.790\ndo my online banking.\n\n115\n00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.670\nWell the first thing that happens\nwhen I connect to that web server,\n\n116\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.560\nis I request Bank of America certificate.\n\n117\n00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.440\nAnd we talked about that the other day.\n\n118\n00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.380\nThat's how I'm gonna get Bank of America's\npublic key, and prove the identity\n\n119\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.340\nof that Bank of America web server,\nthat it actually is Bank of America.\n\n120\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.300\nBut what my computer does when\nit gets that certificate back.\n\n121\n00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.370\nIt doesn't just trust it immediately.\n\n122\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.280\nIt looks at the issuing party.\n\n123\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.940\nAnd on there, there's a signature which\nis something else we've talked about\n\n124\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.935\nin our previous episodes, there's\na signature from the issuing authority.\n\n125\n00:07:20.935 --> 00:07:25.845\nLet's say it's Verisign, I'm not sure\nwho Bank of America actually uses, but\n\n126\n00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:28.495\nthen what my computer is going to do\nis it's going to see that signature and\n\n127\n00:07:28.495 --> 00:07:30.705\nsay okay this was issued by Verisign.\n\n128\n00:07:30.705 --> 00:07:34.435\nMy browser, in the case of Windows,\nmy Internet Explorer has a list\n\n129\n00:07:34.435 --> 00:07:38.755\nof trusted certification authorities,\nVerisign is on that list.\n\n130\n00:07:38.755 --> 00:07:41.290\nThen I'm gonna trust\nthe CA that issued it.\n\n131\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.780\nMy computer trusts Verisign therefore\nit trusts that certificate,\n\n132\n00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.930\nbut it doesn't stop there,\nit does validate the certificate as well.\n\n133\n00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.712\nNow, it's gonna go talk to Verisign and\nsay hey, this server just presented me\n\n134\n00:07:51.712 --> 00:07:54.263\nthis certificate,\nis this certificate still good?\n\n135\n00:07:54.263 --> 00:07:55.970\nBecause it could be expired.\n\n136\n00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:56.690\nMaybe they didn't renew it.\n\n137\n00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.310\nIt could be revoked for some reason.\n\n138\n00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.260\nMaybe it's no longer trusted.\n\n139\n00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:06.850\nSo I'd have to verify that\nthe certificate itself is still valid.\n\n140\n00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.908\n>> Yeah, while you're talking about\nthat Mike, just so you guys can kind of\n\n141\n00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:17.051\nunderstand what a certificate looks\nlike you've never seen one before and\n\n142\n00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:21.074\nthat may be the case that\nyou've never actually seen one.\n\n143\n00:08:21.074 --> 00:08:24.110\nYou've probably been on\nthe business end of it.\n\n144\n00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:32.010\nWhat I'm gonna do here is I'm just\ngoing to pop one up here on my screen.\n\n145\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.560\nWhat I see is I see\na certificate sitting up here.\n\n146\n00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:41.710\nThis is just a random one I chose that's\nbeing used for my start page site.\n\n147\n00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:46.549\nAnd what I have is I can see on there,\nI can see validity dates.\n\n148\n00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:48.267\nSo that's what Mike was\njust talking about.\n\n149\n00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:50.729\nSee there, right in the center right here.\n\n150\n00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:54.142\nIt's good until October 15th.\n\n151\n00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:57.136\nThen we go to the bottom hey,\nlook what we've got.\n\n152\n00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:57.670\n>> Right.\n\n153\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.570\n>> You've got SHA1 and SHA256.\n\n154\n00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.530\nYou guys already have been through this\nwith us during all these episodes.\n\n155\n00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.756\nYou know what those are there for.\n\n156\n00:09:10.756 --> 00:09:13.418\nIf this is something that we're doing,\n\n157\n00:09:13.418 --> 00:09:18.820\nwhat you were pointing out Mike is that we\nwanna trust this if you're trusting it,\n\n158\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.750\none of the important things\nis that has changed at all?\n\n159\n00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.840\nAnd in this case, by looking at this and\nhaving that hash there,\n\n160\n00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.460\nwe can use that as a way to establish\nthat, that has not changed.\n\n161\n00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.390\nAnd so it's an important part that\nyou'll see this on certificate.\n\n162\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.410\nAnd you can see multiple fingerprints.\n\n163\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.950\nYou see a couple here.\n\n164\n00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.960\nThey could have another,\nthey could have an MD5 on there too.\n\n165\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.260\nSo to give you options to validate it.\n\n166\n00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.010\nCuz remember as we were saying,\nwhen we talked about hashes previously,\n\n167\n00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.700\njust because you have\na hash that isn't enough.\n\n168\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.640\nYou have to tell me how you created\nthe hash, so I can recreate the process.\n\n169\n00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:59.819\nSo we've got all these things here,\nwho it's issued to, who it's issued by.\n\n170\n00:09:59.819 --> 00:10:01.631\nWe can go right on down that list.\n\n171\n00:10:01.631 --> 00:10:05.407\nWe can even break down some of these\ndetails, look at it in different forms.\n\n172\n00:10:05.407 --> 00:10:07.334\nThey've got other information.\n\n173\n00:10:07.334 --> 00:10:09.401\nThere's your serial number.\n\n174\n00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:13.464\nThe one I always talk about\nis digital certificates.\n\n175\n00:10:13.464 --> 00:10:16.318\nI try to say it's more or\nless like a driver's license,\n\n176\n00:10:16.318 --> 00:10:18.579\nbecause it has a lot of\nthe same properties.\n\n177\n00:10:18.579 --> 00:10:20.181\n>> Yeah, I use that example all the time.\n\n178\n00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:23.080\nIt's almost a one to one analogy there.\n\n179\n00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.798\n>> Yeah, it's about as close as you\ncan practically get and relate to.\n\n180\n00:10:27.798 --> 00:10:32.928\nSo that's kind of what a certificate would\nlook like you're not gonna see some,\n\n181\n00:10:32.928 --> 00:10:34.880\na whole bunch of fancy stuff.\n\n182\n00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.998\nYou will see, this.\n\n183\n00:10:35.998 --> 00:10:37.501\n>> [LAUGH] They always\ndraw it in these classy,\n\n184\n00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:39.353\nthey'll have something\nthat looks like a diploma.\n\n185\n00:10:39.353 --> 00:10:41.173\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right with a little seal at the bottom\n\n186\n00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:43.889\nand things like that and mentally maybe\nthat's okay to think about it but\n\n187\n00:10:43.889 --> 00:10:46.026\njust understand that when you\nget issued a certificate,\n\n188\n00:10:46.026 --> 00:10:48.990\nthey don't hand you a piece of paper and\nshake your hand or anything like that.\n\n189\n00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.764\n>> They move the tassel from\none side through the other.\n\n190\n00:10:50.764 --> 00:10:53.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n191\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.151\nthere's a-\n>> You're right.\n\n192\n00:10:55.151 --> 00:10:55.701\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just like that.\n\n193\n00:10:55.701 --> 00:10:58.980\n>> So a lot of different components that\nmake up that public key infrastructure,\n\n194\n00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.110\nyou've got that the registration\nauthority that's gonna prove the identity\n\n195\n00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.430\nof who's requesting the certificate.\n\n196\n00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.960\nYou've got the certificate authority, the\ncertification authority that's responsible\n\n197\n00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.440\nfor generating the key pairs and\nthen creating that certificate, and\n\n198\n00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.550\nassociating that with that identity and\ndelivering that certificate.\n\n199\n00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:23.340\nWe've got a revocation list that has to be\nmaintained because certificates are issued\n\n200\n00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.520\nfor a period of time.\n\n201\n00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.337\nThey're not good forever depending,\nit could be 1 year, it could be 5 years,\n\n202\n00:11:28.337 --> 00:11:32.710\ncould be 25 years, depending on the\nissuing authority, what they've decided.\n\n203\n00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.850\nBut they're only good for\nthat time period.\n\n204\n00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.212\nAnd once they reach the end of that time,\neither they're renewed before they reach\n\n205\n00:11:39.212 --> 00:11:43.283\nthe end of that life cycle or once they\nreach the end of it, they're expired.\n\n206\n00:11:43.283 --> 00:11:45.820\nAnd the problem is sometimes certificates,\n\n207\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.368\nwe need to invalidate a certificate\nbefore it reaches the end.\n\n208\n00:11:49.368 --> 00:11:54.072\nLet's say we issue certificates to our\nusers and we issue them for two years.\n\n209\n00:11:54.072 --> 00:11:56.516\nAnd we've got a user that\ngot issued a certificate but\n\n210\n00:11:56.516 --> 00:12:00.340\nwithin that first year of their\nemployment they've left the company.\n\n211\n00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.440\nI don't want them to try to use that\ncertificate to authenticate to my\n\n212\n00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.810\nVPN server or\nto send a message that's digitally signed,\n\n213\n00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.450\nlooking like it's coming from\nthe company or from a current employee.\n\n214\n00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.060\nBut I can't reach out\nlike driver's license,\n\n215\n00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.630\nif your license ever gets suspended,\nthey don't come to your house and\n\n216\n00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.650\ntake the license back from you and\ncut it up in front of you.\n\n217\n00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:21.460\nThey can't do that.\n\n218\n00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.529\nSo what they do is they-\n>> Of course,\n\n219\n00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:23.429\nyou wish they would sometimes.\n\n220\n00:12:23.429 --> 00:12:25.130\n>> I know, right?\n\n221\n00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.690\nThey just suspended,\nthey mark it in their computer system,\n\n222\n00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.920\nwhen that police officer pulls you\nover says, license and registration.\n\n223\n00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.692\nHe takes your license and he goes back\nto the car and he punches it up and\n\n224\n00:12:34.692 --> 00:12:38.335\nhe's checking the database to see\nif that license is still valid,\n\n225\n00:12:38.335 --> 00:12:40.954\ncuz the license says it's good till 2025.\n\n226\n00:12:40.954 --> 00:12:44.112\nBut that might not be right,\nit might have been revoked or suspended or\n\n227\n00:12:44.112 --> 00:12:46.585\nsomething like that,\nsame thing with a certificate.\n\n228\n00:12:46.585 --> 00:12:50.925\nIt might end a certificate's validity\nbefore the expiration date on that\n\n229\n00:12:50.925 --> 00:12:51.840\ncertificate.\n\n230\n00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.370\nSo we have to maintain a list, and\nthat's what I was talking about earlier.\n\n231\n00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.580\nWhen you get presented a certificate,\nyou have to go check that list.\n\n232\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.559\nSure, it says it's valid but\nhas it been revoked for some reason?\n\n233\n00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:05.066\nAnd that's where the revocation\nlists comes into play.\n\n234\n00:13:05.066 --> 00:13:08.010\nAnd that's where all revoked\ncertificates get listed.\n\n235\n00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.950\nAnd you have to talk to the original\nauthority that published the certificate,\n\n236\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.200\nto find out if it has been revoked.\n\n237\n00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.499\nSo what are some other\nthings we could talk about?\n\n238\n00:13:16.499 --> 00:13:20.028\nThere's really most of the components\nthat make it up, I think.\n\n239\n00:13:20.028 --> 00:13:20.864\n>> Yeah.\n\n240\n00:13:20.864 --> 00:13:26.876\nThose are some basic components and\nthose are pretty much standardized\n\n241\n00:13:26.876 --> 00:13:32.350\nacross different platforms and\ndifferent technologies.\n\n242\n00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:37.490\nRemember, certificates and the technology\nof PKI is an overall standard.\n\n243\n00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.950\nWe don't care what the underlying\noperating system on it is.\n\n244\n00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.294\nJust the fact that we can talk to you and\n\n245\n00:13:43.294 --> 00:13:47.258\ninterrogate you to get certain\nthings out of you, that we need.\n\n246\n00:13:47.258 --> 00:13:52.930\nBeing someone presenting you with\na certificate, I need you to validate it.\n\n247\n00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:57.810\nSomething to remember by the way,\njust kind of to throw into the mix\n\n248\n00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.320\nmaybe to throw a monkey wrench into\nthings, I guess as the case may be.\n\n249\n00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.308\nRemember that one of the examples\nyou're using Mike is that you wanna\n\n250\n00:14:06.308 --> 00:14:10.178\nmake sure that if someone\ngets a certificate issued,\n\n251\n00:14:10.178 --> 00:14:14.319\nthey're really getting issued for\nthe correct person.\n\n252\n00:14:14.319 --> 00:14:18.045\nYou don't want someone\nclaiming that they're me and\n\n253\n00:14:18.045 --> 00:14:20.620\ngetting a certificate on my behalf.\n\n254\n00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:25.150\nNow that would be a problem and\nof course yeah, it is a problem,\n\n255\n00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.390\nbut can that happen or\nare there ways for that to happen?\n\n256\n00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:32.440\nYeah, there are ways people can get around\nthe system to do that and cause things.\n\n257\n00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.290\nBut there's something else to think about.\n\n258\n00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:39.890\nThere are some of these third party\nvendors that are in fact a lot\n\n259\n00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:44.580\nof them do this, they will issue email\ncertificates but they do it for free.\n\n260\n00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.010\nAnd you're like oh great,\nI can validate my email and\n\n261\n00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.950\nstuff like that for free, they're giving\nthat to you, take advantage of it.\n\n262\n00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:55.191\nThe problem is with those,\nwhen they give them to you for free,\n\n263\n00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:56.803\nthose are unverified.\n\n264\n00:14:56.803 --> 00:14:59.068\nAnd now, if you look at the certificate,\n\n265\n00:14:59.068 --> 00:15:01.849\nkind of like I was showing\nyou on my screen a bit ago,\n\n266\n00:15:01.849 --> 00:15:06.220\nthat if you look at certificate that way,\nyou will see that it says unverified.\n\n267\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.360\nThe company's telling you that issue\nthat saying that this is unverified.\n\n268\n00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.600\nThis person hasn't submitted anything\nto prove that that's who they are.\n\n269\n00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.578\nWe just took it at face value.\n\n270\n00:15:15.578 --> 00:15:17.249\n>> Right.\n>> There to say they were.\n\n271\n00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:22.837\nSo if you do wanna verify that then the\ncompany has the paid version where you pay\n\n272\n00:15:22.837 --> 00:15:28.777\na few dollars a year and then you provide\na copy of your drivers license, passport.\n\n273\n00:15:28.777 --> 00:15:31.160\nThey'll give you a list of\nthings that are approved.\n\n274\n00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.430\nAnd they'll go and look at that and\nstore it on file and then boom.\n\n275\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.590\nOh now, they'll flip it and\nsay it's a verified thing.\n\n276\n00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:43.317\nThey've checked your credentials and\nthe problem with that system is why it's,\n\n277\n00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:46.886\nhey, getting people to use certificates so\nthey,\n\n278\n00:15:46.886 --> 00:15:52.281\nwe get a higher level of trust and maybe\nhopefully if enough people used them,\n\n279\n00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:55.950\nit'd cut down on some of\nthe nonsense that happens.\n\n280\n00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:59.434\nProblem with it is is that if you\nuse a free email certificate and\n\n281\n00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:02.350\nit does say unverified, that's good.\n\n282\n00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.340\nHowever, how many people you\nknow actually check that?\n\n283\n00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.310\n>> Right.\n>> They're just kind of like oh,\n\n284\n00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.275\nthere's a certificate there.\n\n285\n00:16:09.275 --> 00:16:10.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've tried it where I've\n\n286\n00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.340\npopped in a free certificate in there and\nsent it to someone.\n\n287\n00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:18.381\nAnd they were just happy that when they\nwent in Outlook, they saw it [CROSSTALK]\n\n288\n00:16:18.381 --> 00:16:22.976\na little ribbon stuck on it saying,\nhey this is all cool, we know you.\n\n289\n00:16:22.976 --> 00:16:24.810\nThat's all they were surprised about.\n\n290\n00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:26.650\nThey never went anywhere beyond that.\n\n291\n00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.820\nAnd so, that would be a downside of it.\n\n292\n00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.150\nYou could potentially do it, but\n\n293\n00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.560\nyou're still not getting that warm\nfuzzy front person they say they are.\n\n294\n00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.990\nBut then again,\n\n295\n00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.380\nsocial engineering says that, hey most\npeople aren't going to check to verify.\n\n296\n00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.713\nThey don't know the difference, anyway.\n\n297\n00:16:43.713 --> 00:16:44.970\n>> Exactly.\n\n298\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:49.305\nJust to answer a question out there\nin the chatroom, who was that?\n\n299\n00:16:49.305 --> 00:16:51.040\nDr. Who,\nwhen I log in to VPN on my laptop,\n\n300\n00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.760\npop up Window pops up asking\nwhich certificate to use.\n\n301\n00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.270\nBoth are valid, because I saw earlier,\nyou had two certificates issued to you.\n\n302\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.670\nAnd you asked if you could delete one.\n\n303\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.670\nI would say, don't delete it first.\n\n304\n00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:03.560\nExport it.\n\n305\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.790\nExport one of those certificates\nwith the private key.\n\n306\n00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.570\nPut it on a thumb drive somewhere and\nthen delete that one.\n\n307\n00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.200\nJust in case you delete the wrong one.\n\n308\n00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.580\nIf they both work,\n\n309\n00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.720\nthere's nothing wrong with getting rid of\none of them if they're both still valid.\n\n310\n00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:20.010\nBut just in case you never want to\ndelete a private key like that.\n\n311\n00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.580\nOur certificate in case you need it.\n\n312\n00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:25.080\nYou might have used it to encrypt\nsomething or something like that.\n\n313\n00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.150\nSo don't get rid of it.\n\n314\n00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.180\nExport it, and\nthen remove it from the system.\n\n315\n00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.155\n>> Hey, Doc,\nI'm gonna tell you to get rid of it.\n\n316\n00:17:30.155 --> 00:17:32.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You got the Tardus.\n\n317\n00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.720\nYou should be able to go out and\nfix it, right?\n\n318\n00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.225\nSo.\n>> That's true.\n\n319\n00:17:34.225 --> 00:17:35.288\n[LAUGH]\n\n320\n00:17:35.288 --> 00:17:36.235\n>> All right.\n\n321\n00:17:36.235 --> 00:17:38.790\n>> And\nthere definitely is a price range for\n\n322\n00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.130\ncerts that really depends on what\nyou're gonna use the cert for.\n\n323\n00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:45.870\nIf you're gonna go to a public CA,\nlike VeriSign or Thought or Equifax or\n\n324\n00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:50.550\nGTE, or one of these places, they're going\nto give you a price range whether it's for\n\n325\n00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.060\nan individual versus for a server.\n\n326\n00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.850\nWhether you want to do a wild card, which\nwould cover multiple servers, for example.\n\n327\n00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.900\nHow long it's going to be good for, and\n\n328\n00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.810\nwhat the intended purpose is all\nare going to affect your price.\n\n329\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:10.390\nSo it can vary from less than $100 or\nsomething\n\n330\n00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.650\nup into the thousands of dollars depending\non what you want that certification for.\n\n331\n00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:18.720\nAnd they charge you because when you go to\na public CA, I could run my own CA, right?\n\n332\n00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.500\nI could sit here and install, in fact on\nmy laptop I could fire up a VM, I can\n\n333\n00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.370\ninstall a certificate server on there and\nI could issue certificates to whomever.\n\n334\n00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.250\nBut the problem is,\nnobody's gonna trust Mike CA.\n\n335\n00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.974\nI could convince them to.\n\n336\n00:18:32.974 --> 00:18:34.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I could give them my root CA\n\n337\n00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.660\ncertificate and say, here, install\nthis into your trusted roots, sure.\n\n338\n00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.530\nBut most people shouldn't Be doing that.\n\n339\n00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:43.850\nIf it's in-house, in my company, and\n\n340\n00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.800\nthat's the only place\nI'm using the certs for.\n\n341\n00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.650\nEFS, digitally signing emails back and\nforth within the company,\n\n342\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.600\nconnecting to my VPN server, an in-house\nCEA is perfectly fine and I can issue all\n\n343\n00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.660\nthe certificates I want At no cost to\nme other than maintaining the server.\n\n344\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.250\nBut if it's for a public website, if it's\nfor use outside of the organization,\n\n345\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.060\nI'm gonna have to deal with\nlots of security warnings.\n\n346\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.960\nAnd people saying hey, your certificate\nkeeps coming up as untrusted.\n\n347\n00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.930\nAnd I get all these errors or warnings.\n\n348\n00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.690\nIt's gonna be worth it, to me, to pay a\npublic CA that most Windows, or whatever,\n\n349\n00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.240\nmachines already trust.\n\n350\n00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.150\nSo that's really your difference\nthere between your public CAs\n\n351\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.260\nversus your private.\n\n352\n00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.660\nWhere those certificates\nare gonna be good.\n\n353\n00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.360\nCuz again, it's all about the trust.\n\n354\n00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.970\nBack to the driver's license example,\nwhen I get pulled over by the police,\n\n355\n00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.135\nwhich doesn't ever happen.\n\n356\n00:19:33.135 --> 00:19:36.030\n[LAUGH] I hand him that driver's license.\n\n357\n00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.970\nWell, the officer here in Florida.\n\n358\n00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.120\nLooks at the information and\n\n359\n00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.150\nhe trusts that the information on\nthat drivers license is valid.\n\n360\n00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.160\nWhy?\nHe doesn't know me, but\n\n361\n00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.660\non there there's a big stamp\nfrom the state of Florida.\n\n362\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.570\nAnd he knows that before\nI was issued that license\n\n363\n00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:54.820\nthe State of Florida made me\nbring in a birth certificate.\n\n364\n00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:59.630\nElectric bills, all this stuff to prove\nmy identity, and then they signed it,\n\n365\n00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.240\nthey put their stamp on there.\n\n366\n00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.060\nAnd so he trusts the state of Florida,\nthe issuing party,\n\n367\n00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.560\ntherefore he trusts the information.\n\n368\n00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.950\nIt's the exact same\nthing with certificates.\n\n369\n00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.990\nMy machine, in fact I don't know if\nI'm still kicking with IVGA here, and\n\n370\n00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.170\nI've got I don't even know\nwhere to find it in Chrome.\n\n371\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.720\nSo I'm gonna pull up Internet Explorer and\nshow you guys,\n\n372\n00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.060\nI'm sure you've seen this before.\n\n373\n00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:24.700\nIf I go into my Internet Options, and\n\n374\n00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:30.385\nI take a look at my Content tab,\nand then Certificates.\n\n375\n00:20:30.385 --> 00:20:32.085\nAnd I go to my Trusted Roots.\n\n376\n00:20:32.085 --> 00:20:38.055\nHere's a list of all the public CAs\nthat my computer already knows to trust,\n\n377\n00:20:38.055 --> 00:20:42.415\npeople like Equifax, GoDaddy, Microsoft,\n\n378\n00:20:42.415 --> 00:20:46.515\nSecure Trust, Thought,\nVerisign's on this list.\n\n379\n00:20:46.515 --> 00:20:49.840\nSo anytime a website presents\nme with a certificate\n\n380\n00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.070\nthat's been signed by one of these guys,\nthat digital signature.\n\n381\n00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.920\nMy computer says, oh,\nit was issued by Verasign?\n\n382\n00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.520\nI know they did their job.\n\n383\n00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.560\nThey verified all that information before\nthey ever issued the certificate to\n\n384\n00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.750\nBank of America.\n\n385\n00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.130\nThey made sure it was Bank of America.\n\n386\n00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.960\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\n\n387\n00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.010\ntrust that the information on\nthe certificate is correct, all right?\n\n388\n00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.170\nSo it's all based on that trust model.\n\n389\n00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.150\n>> I think if I was looking at for\n\n390\n00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.910\nmine here while you were talking, but\nI was having trouble getting to it.\n\n391\n00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:22.030\nI know even on that list, it's kind\nof interesting thing to mention, but\n\n392\n00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.870\nsince we're talking about revoking and\nall that.\n\n393\n00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.620\nThere's actually some that are in\nthere that have been revoked.\n\n394\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.890\n>> There used to be one that showed up\nunder untrusted for Microsoft, I remember.\n\n395\n00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.520\n>> Yeah, there's a couple in there,\ncause theirs got compromised.\n\n396\n00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.610\nSomeone was spoofing it, going around\nacting like they were Microsoft.\n\n397\n00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.340\nIt was in there,\nI thought it was still in there.\n\n398\n00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.540\nI don't feel as bad now can't find it,\ncuz I was poking around going\n\n399\n00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.100\nI know that was here, man,\nI just, what happened to it?\n\n400\n00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.910\nBut I guess it got cleaned out,\ncuz it was a while ago.\n\n401\n00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.750\nIt was over ten years ago I think.\n\n402\n00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.350\n>> Yeah, it has been a long time.\n\n403\n00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.230\n>> But it was right in there, so\n>> And\n\n404\n00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.420\nthey had to keep that in there at\nleast until the certificate expired.\n\n405\n00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.000\nOnce it expired maybe they could\nremove it from that list, but\n\n406\n00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.890\nthey wanted to make sure that\nif your computer was presented\n\n407\n00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.800\nwith that certificate it said\nno I don't trust that one.\n\n408\n00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.220\nAnd David brings up the next point I\nwanted to make, again it falls right along\n\n409\n00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.540\nwith our drivers license analogy and\nthat whole thing of trust.\n\n410\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.690\nThat driver's license works\ngreat here in the states, right?\n\n411\n00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.170\nI can go to any one of the states.\n\n412\n00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:25.400\nIf I go to buy a alcoholic beverage\nin Florida, I pull out my license.\n\n413\n00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.200\nAgain, they trust the information.\n\n414\n00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.260\nI take that license to some other country,\n\n415\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.040\nthey might not have the same\nlevel of trust right.\n\n416\n00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.330\nThey don't know the Department of\nMotor Vehicles from the State of Florida.\n\n417\n00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.360\nThey don't trust that.\n\n418\n00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.180\nI might need some other form of identity.\n\n419\n00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.560\nSo again, it just shows the same\nthings like my in house CA.\n\n420\n00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.090\nIt's a perfectly good\ncertificate that it issues.\n\n421\n00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.680\nBut if I try to digitally sign\nan email and send it to company XYZ,\n\n422\n00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.560\ntheir machine is going to look at the\ncertificate that's being used to sign that\n\n423\n00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.050\nand say, who the heck is Mike Seay?\n\n424\n00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:59.960\nI don't know them from Adam.\n\n425\n00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.420\nI'm not going to trust the information.\n\n426\n00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.630\nAnd now I'm going to have to go\nthrough extra steps in order to\n\n427\n00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.470\naccomplish that trust.\n\n428\n00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:10.810\n>> Yeah it's that, usually when you\nlook at it, when you look at stuff,\n\n429\n00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:16.670\nwhen you go international, at some places,\nyeah, they will accept drivers license,\n\n430\n00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.320\nbut then if you go to other places,\nit's gotta be a passport.\n\n431\n00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.170\nYou leave here, the U.S., and passports,\nthere's all sorts of treaties and\n\n432\n00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.020\neverything that say that's\na recognized document.\n\n433\n00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.270\nSo there's that.\n\n434\n00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:32.530\n>> There's a lot of tamper resistance\nbuilt into passports and things like that.\n\n435\n00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.510\nIf they've seen enough driver's licenses,\nmaybe they're comfortable with it.\n\n436\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.160\nBut most places,\n\n437\n00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.620\nyou know if they don't know what a Florida\nlicense is even suppose to look like.\n\n438\n00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.170\nSo how do they know if that's a valid or\n\n439\n00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.910\nif it's something that I printed\nup with my computer at home?\n\n440\n00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:44.760\n>> Yeah.\n\n441\n00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.330\nThat becomes the issue.\n\n442\n00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:51.418\nIf you go to some places overseas,\nif you're there long enough, you know\n\n443\n00:23:51.418 --> 00:23:56.970\nI remember Ryan, into this when I was in\nGermany and in Korea as a matter of fact.\n\n444\n00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.995\nWhich I wasn't driving a career note.\n\n445\n00:23:58.995 --> 00:24:03.041\nNo way, no way, there's-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n446\n00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:04.200\n>> I saw the way.\n\n447\n00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.177\nLove the Koreans, it's just like,\n\n448\n00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:07.080\ntheir cars move in too many different\ndirections, I can't handle it.\n\n449\n00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.538\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but, when I was in Germany,\n\n450\n00:24:11.538 --> 00:24:16.330\nI just came under the length\nof time required for it.\n\n451\n00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:20.380\nBut if you go over a certain time, and\nthere's a lot of countries that do this,\n\n452\n00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.420\nthere's something called\nInternational Driver's License.\n\n453\n00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:28.330\nSo if you're there over a certain period\nof time, they require you to get that and\n\n454\n00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.790\nif you don't,\nthen that's gonna cause you a big problem.\n\n455\n00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:32.710\nAnd the way you get those,\n\n456\n00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.900\nthere's a whole process that you go\nthrough where you prove your identity and\n\n457\n00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.320\nyour native country, and\nthey go through and do some checks.\n\n458\n00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.248\nAnd then, boom,\n\n459\n00:24:39.248 --> 00:24:42.460\nthey issue you a credential that's\ninternationally recognized.\n\n460\n00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.890\nAnd it usually has\na shorter validity period\n\n461\n00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:52.750\nthan a normal driver's license, but\nit's something that carries more weight.\n\n462\n00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:57.570\nBut if you're there for a short period of\ntime, in most countries they don't care.\n\n463\n00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:03.152\nAnd it varies, depending on what\nkind of country you're going to.\n\n464\n00:25:03.152 --> 00:25:08.080\nAnd, heck, I know if you're military,\nfor example,\n\n465\n00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.220\nand there's different agreements for\nthat, too, whether it's recognized or not.\n\n466\n00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.540\nIt's a big mess.\n\n467\n00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:16.480\nBut for most people, driver's license,\n\n468\n00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.600\nInternational Driver's License,\nand if not that, a passport.\n\n469\n00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.330\nIt's gotta be something that they\ncan recognize as being authentic.\n\n470\n00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:26.100\nThat's the big thing.\n\n471\n00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.510\n>> [LAUGH] I like this.\n\n472\n00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.950\nRichard said he was stopped\nby police in Florida,\n\n473\n00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.780\nshowed him his Norwegian driver's license.\n\n474\n00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.720\nAnd the policeman probably didn't\nunderstand a word of it, but\n\n475\n00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.940\nhe accepted it anyway.\n\n476\n00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.510\n>> I use this as my ID here in the U.S.\nand I've been to Hawaii and\n\n477\n00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:45.580\nplaces like that they're supposed\nto check for a driver's license.\n\n478\n00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.720\nBut when I present a credit card,\nif you look at my credit card,\n\n479\n00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.810\nyou can see a little bit,\n\n480\n00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:54.295\nI'm covering the numbers in here because\nI don't trust any of you people.\n\n481\n00:25:54.295 --> 00:25:57.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's got me in uniform on it, and\n\n482\n00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:02.190\nthen it's got my mom, Esmira, taken at my\ngraduation from my officer train school.\n\n483\n00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.240\nAnd it's funny, so I've been in places\nwhere they're supposed to ask for\n\n484\n00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.990\na driver's license, and I went,\nyou gotta look at the card,\n\n485\n00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.742\nand they're like, nevermind.\n\n486\n00:26:10.742 --> 00:26:12.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not a valid ID, but\n\n487\n00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:13.390\nthey kind of look at it.\n\n488\n00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:15.140\nThen there's other people that are like,\nno no,\n\n489\n00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.660\nwe still need to see some ID if that's\nyou, which is always a great conversation.\n\n490\n00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.330\nWe don't know if that's you.\n\n491\n00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.747\nWhat, am I that big of a deal that other\npeople are putting my face on their card?\n\n492\n00:26:24.747 --> 00:26:25.760\n>> I know I have three cards, yeah.\n\n493\n00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.670\n>> I need to start signing some stuff.\n\n494\n00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.290\n[LAUGH] All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, look at the clock.\n\n495\n00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:32.830\nIt's about time for\nus to take a quick break, so\n\n496\n00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.160\nwe're gonna step away for a minute.\n\n497\n00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.720\nWhen we come back, we're gonna\ncontinue on with PKI, so stay tuned.\n\n498\n00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.715\nWe'll be right back.\n\n499\n00:26:38.715 --> 00:26:41.391\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n500\n00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:46.927\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n501\n00:26:46.927 --> 00:26:49.893\nSo we left of talking about\npublic key infrastructure and\n\n502\n00:26:49.893 --> 00:26:52.424\nreally some of the components\nthat make it up as,\n\n503\n00:26:52.424 --> 00:26:57.250\nwell as some fundamental principles just\nkind of in general the way it works.\n\n504\n00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.691\nAnd I think next, Sean,\nwe wanna talk about maybe some examples or\n\n505\n00:27:00.691 --> 00:27:04.600\nplaces we actually see this\npublic key infrastructure in use.\n\n506\n00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:09.100\n>> Yeah, that's the thing, kinda to\ncrystallize everything in your mind and\n\n507\n00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.310\nto talk about what it's used for.\n\n508\n00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:16.180\nWe're going to bring our\ncryptographic concepts and\n\n509\n00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.620\nbring some of the actual real\nworkplaces of where it's used,\n\n510\n00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:24.970\nbring those together so you can see how a\nlot of the stuff we've been talking about\n\n511\n00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:30.240\nover all these episodes, we can bring\nthose over and put them to use and\n\n512\n00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.690\nsee how PKI kinda mixes them all\ntogether to make what is a cryptosystem.\n\n513\n00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.920\nBecause we used that term,\nalready during the week,\n\n514\n00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.180\nwe used the term, cryptosystem,\nthat's exactly what PKI is.\n\n515\n00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.107\nPKI uses a number of\ndifferent technologies,\n\n516\n00:27:45.107 --> 00:27:48.170\nit interacts with a number\nof different technologies.\n\n517\n00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:52.634\nIn fact, stuff like SSL,\nand digital signatures,\n\n518\n00:27:52.634 --> 00:27:58.640\nthose are used with what they\ncall PKI-aware applications.\n\n519\n00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:04.370\nWindows, for example,\nis a PKI-aware operating system.\n\n520\n00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:09.150\nReally, I think you'd have to really work\novertime to find one that wasn't nowadays.\n\n521\n00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:09.800\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n522\n00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.190\n>> But then you have applications\nthat sit on top of that platform.\n\n523\n00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.590\nNot all of them are PKI-aware\njust cuz they don't have to be.\n\n524\n00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:21.550\nBut I think it's fair to say, really\nevery email application out there is\n\n525\n00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.450\nPKI- aware cuz it can use things like SSL,\nand\n\n526\n00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:28.725\nthen it can use digital certificates\nto do the signing and encrypting.\n\n527\n00:28:28.725 --> 00:28:30.170\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n528\n00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:35.190\n>> All your web browsers of any\nconsequence whatsoever are gonna\n\n529\n00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.880\nbe PKI- aware, as well.\n\n530\n00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.130\nAnd then you could kind of extend that\nout, there's a lot of other stuff.\n\n531\n00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:41.450\nI mean, you could do code signing.\n\n532\n00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.870\nIf you're somebody that\ndoes Visual Studio or\n\n533\n00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.680\nany of those integrated\ndevelopment environments,\n\n534\n00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:52.450\nthey have ways of signing your\nsoftware to make sure that it's legit.\n\n535\n00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.850\nThe list goes on and\non and on and on and on.\n\n536\n00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:57.860\nSo, we don't need to go through all that.\n\n537\n00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.190\nWhat we're more interested\nin is talking about,\n\n538\n00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:04.620\nreally a couple of\nthe processes that use PKI, and\n\n539\n00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:10.130\njust how they kinda combine things like\nsymmetric, asymmetric and hashing.\n\n540\n00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.220\nThe big three we've talked\nabout up to this point.\n\n541\n00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.300\nSo that's what our goal is.\n\n542\n00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.160\n>> All right, so I'm going to try,\nladies and gentlemen,\n\n543\n00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.750\nto break out my drawing tool here.\n\n544\n00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.720\nPlease don't critique my artistic skills.\n\n545\n00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.350\nI'm not the best, but\nI think we can get the point across.\n\n546\n00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:29.820\nSo let's start with, I don't know,\nyou want to start with digital signatures?\n\n547\n00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.830\n>> Impress me, surprise me, whatever.\n\n548\n00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:32.845\n>> All right, let's do it.\n\n549\n00:29:32.845 --> 00:29:33.696\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And there you go,\n\n550\n00:29:33.696 --> 00:29:34.920\nyou see my nice drawing that I've made?\n\n551\n00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.720\nThat is a digital signature.\n\n552\n00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.750\n>> Yeah.\n\n553\n00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:41.385\n>> Now, one of the most common places I\nthink we see digital signatures is with\n\n554\n00:29:41.385 --> 00:29:46.810\nyour email applications because we want to\ndigitally sign that email to provide that\n\n555\n00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.960\nintegrity for the email and\nthe non-repudiation.\n\n556\n00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.480\nRemember, one thing I think that\na lot of people misunderstand is\n\n557\n00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:59.150\nwhen you digitally sign an email, you're\nnot providing confidentiality, all right.\n\n558\n00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:03.200\nWe're doing integrity and we're doing\nnon-repudiation, but the email,\n\n559\n00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.170\nitself, is not encrypted.\n\n560\n00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.340\nNot to say that you can't, you can\ntake an extra step and do that, but\n\n561\n00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.590\nthe digital signature is\nnot providing that, right.\n\n562\n00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.800\nIt's providing the integrity and\nthe non-repudiation.\n\n563\n00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.070\n>> Yeah, that's what I always run into,\n\n564\n00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:17.900\nas well, I'm glad you mentioned that\nbecause I run into that all the time.\n\n565\n00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:22.345\nYou feel like you have\nto explicitly say that.\n\n566\n00:30:22.345 --> 00:30:22.940\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n567\n00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:27.305\nif you do want to encrypt it, that that's\nanother layer you're wrapping around that.\n\n568\n00:30:27.305 --> 00:30:33.305\nThe digital signature is only providing\na short number, a short bunch of things.\n\n569\n00:30:33.305 --> 00:30:34.050\nThat's pretty good.\n\n570\n00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:35.845\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so, look at that.\n\n571\n00:30:35.845 --> 00:30:38.205\n>> We're here to try this out.\n\n572\n00:30:38.205 --> 00:30:40.095\nYeah, my drawing is not as good.\n\n573\n00:30:40.095 --> 00:30:41.865\nMy wireless mouse seems\nto skip a little bit.\n\n574\n00:30:41.865 --> 00:30:44.415\nThat's what I'm gonna blame it on, anyway.\n\n575\n00:30:44.415 --> 00:30:45.695\nSo let's say there's me.\n\n576\n00:30:45.695 --> 00:30:50.010\nAnd maybe over here, I got,\nSean, this is gonna be you.\n\n577\n00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.259\nAll right.\n>> Needs bigger biceps.\n\n578\n00:30:51.259 --> 00:30:52.070\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n579\n00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.408\n>> Look at them guns, baby!\n\n580\n00:30:53.408 --> 00:30:56.183\n[LAUGH]\n>> And if I wanna send an email over to\n\n581\n00:30:56.183 --> 00:31:01.910\nSean, and I want to digitally sign it,\nlet's say here's my email.\n\n582\n00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:06.460\nAnd it's got my content here\nthat I wanna digitally sign.\n\n583\n00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:11.419\nSo what's gonna happen is\nI'm gonna run this email\n\n584\n00:31:11.419 --> 00:31:16.850\nthrough a hashing algorithm,\nlike maybe, what Sean?\n\n585\n00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.820\nMD5 or something like that?\n\n586\n00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:21.020\n>> Yeah, that's as good as any.\n\n587\n00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:21.840\nThat's a common one.\n\n588\n00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.300\n>> Right.\n>> So that would be a good choice.\n\n589\n00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.010\n>> All right.\n\n590\n00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:28.900\nAnd then the output of that was\ngonna be that hash, all right.\n\n591\n00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.600\nAnd just to make things really simple and\nkeep it short,\n\n592\n00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.840\nI'm just gonna make up\nsomething like ABC123.\n\n593\n00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.920\nMaybe that's the hash value or\nthe output of that, all right?\n\n594\n00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.700\nAnd what we're gonna end up\ndoing is in the trailer or\n\n595\n00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.470\nthe footer of this email,\nwe're gonna put that value.\n\n596\n00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.660\nSo ABC123, right?\n\n597\n00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.670\nSo that's my hashing algorithm.\n\n598\n00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:55.508\nNow, I have a key pair issued to me.\n\n599\n00:31:55.508 --> 00:32:00.242\nSo we're gonna call this green key,\nmy public key, and\n\n600\n00:32:00.242 --> 00:32:05.910\nwe're gonna call this red key,\nmy private key, all right [COUGH].\n\n601\n00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:09.490\nSo what I'm gonna do is once I run\nthat through the algorithm and\n\n602\n00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.620\nI've generated this hash value,\nI attach that hash value.\n\n603\n00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:17.096\nThen I'm gonna use my private\nkey to encrypt the footer or\n\n604\n00:32:17.096 --> 00:32:20.490\nencrypt just that hash value, right?\n\n605\n00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:21.870\nNot the entire document.\n\n606\n00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:25.550\nThat's where we say,\nit's not providing the confidentiality.\n\n607\n00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:31.015\nThen I'm gonna send that\ndocument over to Sean, all right?\n\n608\n00:32:31.015 --> 00:32:32.555\nNow when he gets that document and\n\n609\n00:32:32.555 --> 00:32:37.465\nI'll try to recreate it real quick here,\nI've got my document, I've got my footer.\n\n610\n00:32:37.465 --> 00:32:43.090\nIt's got that hash value\ninserted down there, ABC123 and\n\n611\n00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:48.860\nit's been encrypted with my private key,\nall right.\n\n612\n00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.350\nSo what Sean's gonna do is he's gonna ask\nme to send over my certificate, right?\n\n613\n00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:57.520\nCuz remember, your public key is part of\nthat digital certificate that you have.\n\n614\n00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.961\nSo I send Sean my certificate.\n\n615\n00:32:58.961 --> 00:33:00.000\nAll right?\n\n616\n00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:07.830\nNow what Sean can then do,\nhe now has my public key, all right.\n\n617\n00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:13.682\nAnd if he can use my public key to decrypt\nthat and retrieve that hash value,\n\n618\n00:33:13.682 --> 00:33:19.180\nthen what do we get from that?\n\n619\n00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.670\nWe get our nonrepudiation, right?\n\n620\n00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:26.350\nBecause if my public key\nsuccessfully decrypts\n\n621\n00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:31.560\nthe footer of that document or\nthat hash value down there, then\n\n622\n00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.800\nthe only thing that could have encrypted\nin the first place was my private key.\n\n623\n00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.210\nAnd I'm the only one that has\naccess to my private key, so\n\n624\n00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:41.260\nhe gets that nonrepudiation.\n\n625\n00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.680\nIt had to have come from me, all right.\n\n626\n00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.727\nThen what Sean can do is\ntake this document and\n\n627\n00:33:47.727 --> 00:33:52.310\nrun it through that same hashing\nalgorithm, say MD5, all right.\n\n628\n00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:59.050\nCuz that's what I used on my end and\nhe's gonna generate his own hash value.\n\n629\n00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.068\nIf those two hash values match,\nthe one that he generated and\n\n630\n00:34:04.068 --> 00:34:06.584\nthe one that I sent\nalong with the document,\n\n631\n00:34:06.584 --> 00:34:11.485\nthen that's telling me that that document\nhas not been modified in transit, right?\n\n632\n00:34:11.485 --> 00:34:14.230\nCuz remember,\nwhen we talked about hashing algorithms,\n\n633\n00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:17.815\nsaid if you run the same thing through\nthat hashing algorithm over and over,\n\n634\n00:34:17.815 --> 00:34:20.750\nit's always gonna generate\nthe exact same value.\n\n635\n00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:25.190\nIf you change one single character in\nthat email, whether it's malicious or\n\n636\n00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.840\nwhether it's unintentional\nlike corruption,\n\n637\n00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.150\nas it travels across the network,\nthose hash values are not gonna match.\n\n638\n00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:33.080\nYou're gonna generate a completely\ndifferent hash value and\n\n639\n00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.780\nyou're gonna know something is wrong.\n\n640\n00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.910\nSo that is basically a digital signature.\n\n641\n00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:41.380\nWe're using a combination of hashing and\n\n642\n00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:46.140\nasymmetric algorithms to\nprovide that nonrepudiation,\n\n643\n00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:50.840\nas well as the data integrity.\n\n644\n00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.150\n>> You know what that reminds me of?\n\n645\n00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:53.160\n>> What's that?\n\n646\n00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.300\nA three year old drawing?\n\n647\n00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.067\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n648\n00:34:55.067 --> 00:34:57.670\n>> Well see,\nyou've got the perfect opening there.\n\n649\n00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:01.770\nJames asks does the drawing program,\nis it free, does it have a free version?\n\n650\n00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:02.980\nThat is the free version.\n\n651\n00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.391\nIt's not that Mike can't draw, they only\nput stick figures in the free version.\n\n652\n00:35:06.391 --> 00:35:07.546\n>> [LAUGH] That's what it is.\n\n653\n00:35:07.546 --> 00:35:09.684\nActually it's a really cool program.\n\n654\n00:35:09.684 --> 00:35:12.598\nIt's called Classic Whiteboard by Adobe.\n\n655\n00:35:12.598 --> 00:35:15.270\nIt runs on Adobe Air,\nkind of hard to find nowadays but\n\n656\n00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.030\nI love it because it's simple.\n\n657\n00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.862\nIt's there not complex,\nyou got three markers you can,\n\n658\n00:35:19.862 --> 00:35:23.048\nfour markers you can click on and\nan eraser and that's about it.\n\n659\n00:35:23.048 --> 00:35:26.944\n>> It reminds me of that game when they\ntarget 2,600 Venture remember that?\n\n660\n00:35:26.944 --> 00:35:28.301\n>> Oh yeah!\n>> You pick up the key\n\n661\n00:35:28.301 --> 00:35:29.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n662\n00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:31.050\n>> We should draw like a bat and\n\n663\n00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:31.961\na dragon in there.\n\n664\n00:35:31.961 --> 00:35:34.475\n>> Right.\n>> It would be totally cool with that.\n\n665\n00:35:34.475 --> 00:35:36.456\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For the rest of you can Google that.\n\n666\n00:35:36.456 --> 00:35:40.920\n>> [LAUGH] And you know there's\na thing I'd like to point out here,\n\n667\n00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.940\nbecause remember people always\nseem to think that the public key\n\n668\n00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:48.140\nalways does the encryption and the private\nkey always does the decryption and\n\n669\n00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.280\nthat's not the case as you see here.\n\n670\n00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:55.280\nI actually encrypted this data with my\nprivate key, not my public key, and that\n\n671\n00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.020\nway, if he can use the other half of the\nkey pair, he can prove it came from me.\n\n672\n00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.280\nSo this is an example of where the private\nkey is actually the one that's doing\n\n673\n00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.180\nthe encryption,\nthe public key is doing the decryption.\n\n674\n00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:11.630\n>> Yeah, when I'm talking\nabout these types of things,\n\n675\n00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:16.910\ndigital signatures, SSL,\nanything like that, it's right.\n\n676\n00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:18.230\nWhich key does it use?\n\n677\n00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:21.170\nIt's not necessarily the public,\nit's not necessarily the private.\n\n678\n00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:25.320\nWhat you need to ask first\nis what is your goal.\n\n679\n00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.940\nYour goal determines which key\nyou're gonna use to reach it.\n\n680\n00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:36.650\nIn this case with it's signature, you're\ntrying to prove definitively that such and\n\n681\n00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:41.690\nsuch was the originator of this document\nwith a public and private key pair.\n\n682\n00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:46.010\nThere's only one way to do it,\nif you look at the way things work.\n\n683\n00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:47.670\nSo once you kind of look at it and\nsay yeah,\n\n684\n00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:53.150\nwell private key is Is exclusive to one\nspecific individual in this scenario.\n\n685\n00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:57.250\nThat's the only way you're gonna\ntie it back to that one individual.\n\n686\n00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:58.730\nYou can't do it any other way.\n\n687\n00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.610\nIf you use the public key,\nit's a public key.\n\n688\n00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.130\nEveryone has access to that.\n\n689\n00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:05.010\nAnd then on top of it,\n\n690\n00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.960\nit wouldn't do anyone any good anyway\nbecause they can't reverse it.\n\n691\n00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.935\n>> I'm not gonna sent you my private\nkey so you can try to decrypt it.\n\n692\n00:37:10.935 --> 00:37:13.860\n[CROSSTALK] Private keys have\nto remain private, exactly.\n\n693\n00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:18.417\n>> I would tell you, and to keep things\nclear and straightforward with you,\n\n694\n00:37:18.417 --> 00:37:23.920\nwith a digital signature, remember when\nyou're going through this process.\n\n695\n00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.920\nI always tell people, think of a document,\nwhen you sign it, whatever it is.\n\n696\n00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.250\nLoan document, contract,\nwhatever you're signing.\n\n697\n00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:36.750\nYou're, when you attach\nyour John Hancock to it,\n\n698\n00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:39.540\nit's you're doing\na number of things there.\n\n699\n00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:44.030\nBy attaching that document, you know,\ninking it on, you're saying you agree to\n\n700\n00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:48.990\nthat version of the document by\napplying your unique signature to it.\n\n701\n00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:52.540\nYour signature also is unique to you,\nso they can tie it back to you.\n\n702\n00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.550\nSo, you agreed to that document.\n\n703\n00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:58.540\nAnd if they analyze that, and look at it\nand see it's a genuine signature from you,\n\n704\n00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.190\nit's authentic.\n\n705\n00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:01.940\nSo we've got three things being done.\n\n706\n00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:05.000\nBut if you also think\nabout it in those terms.\n\n707\n00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.070\nIf this was a contract that I had in\nfront of me, and you signed it and\n\n708\n00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:11.480\nI just left it here,\nthere's no confidentiality there.\n\n709\n00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.100\nIf I want to keep that secret, that's got\nto get stuck in a filing cabinet some\n\n710\n00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.970\nplace and locked up,\nthat's your confidentiality.\n\n711\n00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:20.550\nSo remember that, you're signing\nsomething, in no way, shape or\n\n712\n00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:21.910\nform is that kept secret.\n\n713\n00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:25.550\nSignatures do not do that.\n\n714\n00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:29.970\nDo remember, though, to go back from\nsomething from a previous episode.\n\n715\n00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:32.960\nThe process that Mike just\nillustrated up there.\n\n716\n00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.700\nThat process, while it is very simple.\n\n717\n00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.290\nIt's very, very secure.\n\n718\n00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.370\nIt's very very powerful.\n\n719\n00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:41.780\nIt's also legally binding nowadays too.\n\n720\n00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:46.500\nSo this process, if you did that, so\nyou know, if he signs that document and\n\n721\n00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.730\nsends it to me, that's considered\nto be a legally binding document.\n\n722\n00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.490\nAnd that's all they wrote,\nso to speak on that.\n\n723\n00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:56.146\n>> Exactly.\nAll right, and another one Sean that I\n\n724\n00:38:56.146 --> 00:39:01.290\nthink we want to try to just show real\nquick would be, what were we gonna do?\n\n725\n00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:02.060\nOh, SSL.\n\n726\n00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.220\nYeah, our secure socket layer.\n\n727\n00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.490\nAnd just another example of where PKI and\n\n728\n00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:11.460\nthe asymmetric and symmetric\nalgorithms are in part of our lives,\n\n729\n00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:16.150\nour everyday lives that we do,\nwhether business or for home.\n\n730\n00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.570\nBecause we all go to secure websites,\nI'm sure.\n\n731\n00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.180\nWe purchase something online.\n\n732\n00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:27.320\nWe've logged in to some server, we have,\nI'm trying to think of something else.\n\n733\n00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.170\nDone online banking,\nor something like that.\n\n734\n00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.200\nSo we've needed to setup\nthat secure communication.\n\n735\n00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:38.930\n>> And remember, by the way, SSL,\nit's used all over the place,\n\n736\n00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.730\nlike Mike was saying, for e-commerce.\n\n737\n00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.300\nYou go to Amazon.\n\n738\n00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.430\nYou go to PayPal.\n\n739\n00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:45.450\nYou to to eBay.\n\n740\n00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:49.246\nWherever you wanna go, it's used there,\nbut it's also used for\n\n741\n00:39:49.246 --> 00:39:50.570\nthings like Webmail.\n\n742\n00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:54.470\nIt's also used for things just\nlike your regular email client.\n\n743\n00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:59.633\nMy email client,\nhere Goes to my provider using SSL,\n\n744\n00:39:59.633 --> 00:40:03.437\nit wraps up you know my IMAP and my SNTP.\n\n745\n00:40:03.437 --> 00:40:07.789\nIt wraps SSL around that as\na layer of protection so and\n\n746\n00:40:07.789 --> 00:40:11.620\nthen we also have things like SSTP for\nVPNs.\n\n747\n00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:16.570\nThat's a tunneling protocol\nthat is based off of SSL.\n\n748\n00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:22.060\nSo it's not just tied to e-commerce,\nit's actually a broad range of areas.\n\n749\n00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.960\nStuff Mike's gonna draw out here though,\nis,\n\n750\n00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.430\nwould apply across the board\nto any of those, so.\n\n751\n00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:31.420\n>> Yes, same process setting up that SSL\nconnection and getting everything set up.\n\n752\n00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.270\nSo what I'm going to do, I'm just going\nto show you a quick example here.\n\n753\n00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:36.500\nI think we've actually\nverbalized this a few times, but\n\n754\n00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.640\njust to show you in a drawing form.\n\n755\n00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.170\nLet's say I'm at home and\nI wanna connect over here to bank,\n\n756\n00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:46.600\nwe'll say this is Bank of America's\ngood old web server here.\n\n757\n00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.090\nSo we'll say that's BoA.\n\n758\n00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:52.170\nAnd I want to connect, and\nI wanna do some online banking.\n\n759\n00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.500\nSo I wanna make sure I\nhave a secure connection.\n\n760\n00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.660\nSo what's gonna happen is my\ncomputer's gonna reach out.\n\n761\n00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.690\nTo Bank of America right?\n\n762\n00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:03.460\nI'm going to start that three-way\nhandshake, that TCPI connection there.\n\n763\n00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:08.540\nAnd I'm going to ask Bank of America to\nprove to me that they really are Bank\n\n764\n00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:12.630\nof America, because I don't want to setup\na secure connection and start transmitting\n\n765\n00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:16.180\nconfidential information if that's\nnot actually Bank of America, right?\n\n766\n00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:20.780\nWhat if it's somebody doing a phishing\nscam or something like that?\n\n767\n00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:24.770\nSo I've got to verify the identity, and\nwhat Bank of America's going to do.\n\n768\n00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:29.710\nThey've got their certificate that\nthey've been issued by Verisign or\n\n769\n00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:34.280\nwhomever and\nin that certificate is their public key.\n\n770\n00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:40.350\nAnd, of course, Bank of America has\nthe associated private key, as well.\n\n771\n00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:43.370\nAnd so when I ask them to verify their\nidentity, they're gonna send, oops,\n\n772\n00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:49.170\nthey're gonna send back, you guys aren't\ntoo worried about the color, right?\n\n773\n00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:53.030\nThey're gonna send back that certificate.\n\n774\n00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.660\nRight?\n\n775\n00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.460\nNow once I've got that certificate,\nI can verify.\n\n776\n00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:00.830\nWe talked about with PKI, I'm gonna\nlook at who signed that certificate.\n\n777\n00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:02.910\nSay, VeriSign for example.\n\n778\n00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:06.040\nMy computer's gonna reach out\nto VeriSign and say, hey.\n\n779\n00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.650\nI see that you've issued this\ncertificate to Bank of America.\n\n780\n00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:10.880\nShow me your revocation list.\n\n781\n00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.170\nLet me just make sure that this\ncertificate hasn't been revoked for\n\n782\n00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:15.900\nsome reason, all right?\n\n783\n00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.200\nOnce I've validated the certificate,\nit hasn't expired, the name on\n\n784\n00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:23.480\nthe certificate matches the name of the\nserver that's presenting the certificate,\n\n785\n00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.490\nand it's not on that revocation list,\nI now trust it, and\n\n786\n00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:32.430\nI have a copy of Bank of\nAmerica's public key.\n\n787\n00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:36.870\nAnd so what my computer's going\nto do is generate a session key.\n\n788\n00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:39.330\nThat's a warped session key there.\n\n789\n00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:41.760\nAnd that's going to be a symmetric key.\n\n790\n00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.833\n>> It's a bad algorithm.\n\n791\n00:42:42.833 --> 00:42:46.440\n>> [LAUGH] It is a bad algorithm,\nit deserves a bad key.\n\n792\n00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.330\nAnd I need,\nremember the way symmetric works, right?\n\n793\n00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:51.770\nBoth sides need the same key.\n\n794\n00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.580\nSymmetric, one key to rule them all.\n\n795\n00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.040\nThe key that does the encryption\nalso does the decryption.\n\n796\n00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.850\nSo I need to send this key over to Bank\nof America so that we both have it.\n\n797\n00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:06.555\nBut if I do that, if I send that over,\nwhat if somebody intercepts that key?\n\n798\n00:43:06.555 --> 00:43:09.245\nRight?\nThey could then decrypt all of the content\n\n799\n00:43:09.245 --> 00:43:12.485\nor traffic going back and\nforth between us as well.\n\n800\n00:43:12.485 --> 00:43:16.005\nSo since I've got their public key,\nI'm gonna wrap up that.\n\n801\n00:43:16.005 --> 00:43:17.985\nI'm gonna take a copy,\nand let's do it this way.\n\n802\n00:43:17.985 --> 00:43:20.835\nI'm gonna take a copy\nof that symmetric key.\n\n803\n00:43:22.665 --> 00:43:25.625\nAnd I'm going to wrap it up,\n\n804\n00:43:25.625 --> 00:43:31.460\nencrypt it using their public\nkey to do the encryption.\n\n805\n00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.710\nSo, now who can decrypt that, right?\n\n806\n00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:39.190\nOnly whoever has the matching private\nkey and that's gonna be Bank of America.\n\n807\n00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:42.240\nSo I can send this symmetric\nkey over to them, and\n\n808\n00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.980\nI don't care if anybody intercepts it.\n\n809\n00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.790\nBecause they don't have the private key\nthat's gonna allow them to decrypt that.\n\n810\n00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:52.290\nOnce it gets over to Bank of America's\nend, they can use their private key to\n\n811\n00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:56.500\ndecrypt that session key,\nretrieve that session key out of there.\n\n812\n00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:04.130\nAnd voila, we now both have a copy of\nthe same symmetric key or session key.\n\n813\n00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.010\nAnd we can now encrypt data and\nsend it back and forth.\n\n814\n00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:10.650\nAnd you might think well,\nwhy not just use the public and\n\n815\n00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:12.380\nprivate keys to do this\nin the first place?\n\n816\n00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:16.330\nLike Bank of America could have encrypted\ndata with their private key, and\n\n817\n00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:19.750\nI could decrypt it with their public key,\nbut they don't have my certificate.\n\n818\n00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:20.500\nDo I have the certificate?\n\n819\n00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.258\nI mean am I going to send over\nmy certificate every time,\n\n820\n00:44:23.258 --> 00:44:26.205\nare they gonna trust my certificate,\nwho's it issued by?\n\n821\n00:44:26.205 --> 00:44:30.100\nAnd remember the other thing about\nasymmetric encryption, it's heavier.\n\n822\n00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.753\nIt takes a lot more\nprocessing power to work.\n\n823\n00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:33.986\nNow we're using,\n\n824\n00:44:33.986 --> 00:44:38.918\nwe used asymmetric encryption just to\nencrypt that symmetric key, right,\n\n825\n00:44:38.918 --> 00:44:43.541\nnow we can use the symmetric encryption\nto encrypt the bulk of the data,\n\n826\n00:44:43.541 --> 00:44:48.343\nall the data that's flying back and\nforth between me and Bank of America.\n\n827\n00:44:48.343 --> 00:44:54.449\n>> And you can see, it's combining\ndifferent techniques once again,\n\n828\n00:44:54.449 --> 00:45:00.280\nin this case it's doing symmetric and\nasymmetric together.\n\n829\n00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.770\nAnd it's to get a better solution\n\n830\n00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.640\nthan it would be if you just\nused symmetric on its own.\n\n831\n00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.760\nUse symmetric on its own,\n\n832\n00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:11.510\nwe have to overcome that big\nproblem of key distribution.\n\n833\n00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.280\nThat would be the number one thing here.\n\n834\n00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.100\nYou have to figure out how to get that.\n\n835\n00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:19.530\nYou know over the person not that be\nintercepted, but if you use asymmetric\n\n836\n00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:24.710\nwith it, then if you use it\nthe right way it makes it just so\n\n837\n00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:28.880\nmuch easier and that's the thing, is using\nit the right way notice if you compare and\n\n838\n00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.650\ncontrast digital signatures with SSL.\n\n839\n00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:36.970\nNotice which key you started\nwith on both sides, you know?\n\n840\n00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.320\nOne, we initiated\nthe process with a private.\n\n841\n00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.300\nAnd one we initiated with a public.\n\n842\n00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:45.500\nIt was all based on what\nour end result was.\n\n843\n00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.060\nRun.\nFirst one we want to,\n\n844\n00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.560\nby signing something,\nI want to tie it back to a specific party.\n\n845\n00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.548\nThe only way you can do that is by\nusing a private key that's only used by\n\n846\n00:45:54.548 --> 00:45:55.300\nthat party.\n\n847\n00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:59.786\nHere I want to get someone,\na piece of information to someone,\n\n848\n00:45:59.786 --> 00:46:04.867\nin such a way that anyone else that\nmay be eavesdropping anyplace else,\n\n849\n00:46:04.867 --> 00:46:07.505\nwhatsoever, cannot intercept it.\n\n850\n00:46:07.505 --> 00:46:10.120\nAnd even if they do, they can't unlock it.\n\n851\n00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:14.070\nSo the way I do that,\npublic key I have access to.\n\n852\n00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:17.960\nOnce I wrap something up\nusing the public key,\n\n853\n00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.540\nonly someone who has that corresponding\nprivate key can unlock it.\n\n854\n00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:26.620\nSo we see that depending on\nwhich one you use, first,\n\n855\n00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.280\ndepends on what your end goal is.\n\n856\n00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.960\nI always tell people, follow the key.\n\n857\n00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.230\nPay attention to which one's\nbeing used in that key pair.\n\n858\n00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:36.100\nOnce you understand what private and\n\n859\n00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:40.110\npublic mean, and\nwhat the significance of each is, it's\n\n860\n00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.880\neasy money to figure out which one you're\ngonna use first in any given situation.\n\n861\n00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.870\n>> Exactly.\n\n862\n00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.440\nI got a question out\nthere in the chatroom.\n\n863\n00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:50.240\nBen's asking, do you think there\nare too many certificate authorities?\n\n864\n00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.490\nI don't know, me personally I don't\nknow how you feel about it Shawn,\n\n865\n00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:55.880\nI mean free enterprise systems,\ncompetition is good.\n\n866\n00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:00.137\nYou don't have to choose to trust them\nall if you don't want to use them all.\n\n867\n00:47:00.137 --> 00:47:01.630\n[LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n868\n00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:03.930\n>> I know an easy way to settle this,\nwhose got a quarter?\n\n869\n00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:04.600\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n870\n00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.790\n>> I'm gonna flip that thing.\n\n871\n00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:07.380\n>> All right.\n\n872\n00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:11.430\n>> I don't know how you say there's too\nmany, it does make the list of people that\n\n873\n00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:15.770\nI have to trust because Bank of America\nmight buy their certificate from Verisign\n\n874\n00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:19.380\nand some other company I deal with\nbuy's their certificate from Fot.\n\n875\n00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:22.790\nWe hear it at New or IT Pro TV.\n\n876\n00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:29.426\nI end up using, gosh, I think we got ours\nfrom GTE or Equifax or somebody like that.\n\n877\n00:47:29.426 --> 00:47:33.738\nBut there's different places and\nby having a choice of who I can buy\n\n878\n00:47:33.738 --> 00:47:37.665\na certificate from,\nthat helps keep prices competitive and\n\n879\n00:47:37.665 --> 00:47:42.988\nthings like that I don't know if there's\nanything wrong with having more CA's.\n\n880\n00:47:42.988 --> 00:47:47.609\n>> Yeah, I'm kind of the same,\nwell I'm kind of the fence if you really\n\n881\n00:47:47.609 --> 00:47:52.546\nwanna get down to it, cuz that's the way\nthe market works having a bunch of\n\n882\n00:47:52.546 --> 00:47:55.910\noutlooks saying keep the prices low and\nall that.\n\n883\n00:47:55.910 --> 00:48:00.510\nThat's the free market side,\nand all that good stuff.\n\n884\n00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:04.896\nThe side I look at here is that\nif it gets to be too many,\n\n885\n00:48:04.896 --> 00:48:11.400\nwhich you could argue there is already,\nthe average Joe can easily be fooled.\n\n886\n00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:16.250\nCan I make a certificate by going\nto an off-brand company and\n\n887\n00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:19.010\nsaying, hey, I'm Microsoft?\n\n888\n00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:20.390\nYeah, you could do that.\n\n889\n00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:22.241\nNo problem.\nYou could set up one that says\n\n890\n00:48:22.241 --> 00:48:25.860\nI'm Microsoft, and someone looks\nat the certificate, clicks on it.\n\n891\n00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:31.165\nAnd if they have even been taught how\nto do that, oh, it says Microsoft.\n\n892\n00:48:31.165 --> 00:48:31.965\nI'm good.\n\n893\n00:48:31.965 --> 00:48:33.485\nI'll accept that.\n\n894\n00:48:33.485 --> 00:48:37.445\nThey don't know that the CA\nthat I've set up, I mean,\n\n895\n00:48:37.445 --> 00:48:40.535\nI could have set that up in my house and\ncalled it Sean Wicked CA, or\n\n896\n00:48:40.535 --> 00:48:43.215\nsomething like that, and\nsigned the heck out of it.\n\n897\n00:48:43.215 --> 00:48:46.905\nThey don't know, they're not looking\nat that, they're going like, it says\n\n898\n00:48:46.905 --> 00:48:53.290\nMicrosoft, and clearly that website is\nMicrosoft, and that's all they wrote.\n\n899\n00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:57.560\nSo you could make a claim\nthat that could be the issue.\n\n900\n00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:03.830\nAnd yeah, there's a lot of CAs out there,\nfortunately they're pretty well policed.\n\n901\n00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:08.790\nAnd when one of them goes bad or has an\nissue, they jump on that pretty quickly.\n\n902\n00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:12.230\nBecause, as Mike was saying,\nthis system relies on trust.\n\n903\n00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:17.630\nIf that trust is lost it can get\nvery quickly lost across the board,\n\n904\n00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:20.460\nso you've gotta contain that very quickly.\n\n905\n00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:25.083\nSo, there's been a very, very good\nself-policing, I guess is the way to put\n\n906\n00:49:25.083 --> 00:49:28.793\nit, of that to make sure the ones\nthat are out there are legit and\n\n907\n00:49:28.793 --> 00:49:31.690\nthat you don't have any\nkinda weird ones pop up.\n\n908\n00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:37.210\nHowever, I know they mentioned it,\nit's been mentioned in the news,\n\n909\n00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:41.258\nI know it was mentioned on\nsome of the IT magazines and\n\n910\n00:49:41.258 --> 00:49:46.920\nwebsites that they had one in China\nthat was issuing bogus stuff.\n\n911\n00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.190\nThere was some questionable\nstuff in their process, and\n\n912\n00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.720\nthey just went over there and said,\nglobally, no one's trusting you.\n\n913\n00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.700\nAnd like that stuff was gone,\ntheir stuff was off the map.\n\n914\n00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:01.470\nIf you had any certificates\nissued by them,\n\n915\n00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:05.130\nthey would no longer verify or validate.\n\n916\n00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:10.050\nAnd so that company that was\nissuing those got really just,\n\n917\n00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:13.508\npardon my French, pissed about that\nhappening because that was their business.\n\n918\n00:50:13.508 --> 00:50:16.000\nTheir business overnight got just,\n\n919\n00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.180\nsomeone else in the globe was able\nto just go through and say, hey,\n\n920\n00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:23.610\nyou're not following safe practices, you\nhave a compromise, you've got problems.\n\n921\n00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:26.950\nHey, guess what, there's a big red\nswitch or button over here, boom.\n\n922\n00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:27.870\nYou're done, that's it.\n\n923\n00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:34.056\nAnd you can look it up,\nit's only happened maybe in the last two,\n\n924\n00:50:34.056 --> 00:50:37.510\nthree, four months, somewhere in there.\n\n925\n00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:40.339\nAnd the company in China\nis trying to resolve it,\n\n926\n00:50:40.339 --> 00:50:43.940\nwhat the issue is so\nthey can come back into the business.\n\n927\n00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.050\nBut right now, that's their business.\n\n928\n00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:50.430\nAnything else they have in that\nbusiness kind of relies still back on\n\n929\n00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:51.670\nthe certificates.\n\n930\n00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:53.640\nSo effectively,\nthe community has gone through and\n\n931\n00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.516\nsaid you're done here until\nyou fix this problem.\n\n932\n00:50:56.516 --> 00:50:58.096\nYou're done.\n\n933\n00:50:58.096 --> 00:50:59.760\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n934\n00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.610\nAnd Ben, to answer your next question\nthere, is there an updated list?\n\n935\n00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:06.630\nWell, your applications,\nlike Internet Explorer, for example,\n\n936\n00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:10.279\nhas that list of trusted root\ncertification authorities.\n\n937\n00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:16.500\nAnd Windows updates would modify\nthat list if there's a new one, or\n\n938\n00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.020\nif one needs to be removed.\n\n939\n00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:21.440\nBut you're more than welcome,\nif Sean builds up a CA and\n\n940\n00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:27.320\nissues his own web server certificate,\nand you go to his website and\n\n941\n00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:32.590\nit presents that certificate, you can\nchoose to import his root CA certificate\n\n942\n00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:36.888\ninto your trusted roots, and you will\ntrust all the certificates he issues.\n\n943\n00:51:36.888 --> 00:51:41.300\nOr you can import just that one\ncertificate, and you could trust that one.\n\n944\n00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:45.110\nSo it's kind of up to the end user and\nthat's why like IE, for example, will give\n\n945\n00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:49.090\nyou that big red page that says, hey look,\nthis certificate can't be trusted.\n\n946\n00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:50.420\nAre you sure you wanna continue?\n\n947\n00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:52.220\nAnd they don't give you an easy\nway to continue, right?\n\n948\n00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:54.587\nYou have to click details or\nsomething like that and say,\n\n949\n00:51:54.587 --> 00:51:55.930\nwhat's the secret handshake?\n\n950\n00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:57.610\n>> Continue to website anyway.\n\n951\n00:51:57.610 --> 00:51:59.100\n>> Yeah.\nBecause they know, and\n\n952\n00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:03.140\nthey're trying to protect you because\nyou might not understand what it means\n\n953\n00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.440\nto trust the certificate.\n\n954\n00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.530\nAnd that's a big problem, because if\nyou ever trust the root.ca certificate,\n\n955\n00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:12.100\nyou now trust their entire\npublic key infrastructure and\n\n956\n00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.180\nevery certificate that they issue,\nnow and in the future.\n\n957\n00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.990\nSo you really wanna be careful.\n\n958\n00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:22.200\nAnd that just comes to user education,\nI think, more than anything.\n\n959\n00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:27.030\n>> I seem to remember there was\na point in time, maybe it was just\n\n960\n00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:30.140\nthe early days of the Internet,\nthat they used to train as part of\n\n961\n00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:35.140\nsecurity awareness to tell end users, hey,\nclick on this and look at the certificate.\n\n962\n00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:39.180\nI don't even know if that was\na benefit when they did it.\n\n963\n00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.210\nIt gave people a warm fuzzy feeling.\n\n964\n00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:42.330\nBecause they just click okay.\n\n965\n00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:43.270\nYeah, that was it.\n\n966\n00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:45.330\nIt was like, oh look,\nthere's a certificate.\n\n967\n00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:48.700\nIt gave them a false sense of security,\n\n968\n00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:52.450\nwhere they really maybe\nshouldn't have had one.\n\n969\n00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:57.970\nI'd liken it to, when you have a kid\nhears something in the house and\n\n970\n00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:00.800\npulls the blanket over their head, so\nthe axe murderer doesn't get, okay,\n\n971\n00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.260\nI had a weird childhood.\n\n972\n00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.690\nJust deal with it, all right?\n\n973\n00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:05.790\nShut up.\nYou got your issues, I got mine.\n\n974\n00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:07.580\nBut that's the thing, it's like, oh,\n\n975\n00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:11.270\nthis is gonna stop the guy from\nkidnapping me or hitting me with an axe.\n\n976\n00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:15.080\nYeah, you won't see it coming, but\nit was the same type of thing.\n\n977\n00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:19.430\nIf you don't know the implications of\nwhat that certificate's telling you,\n\n978\n00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:21.730\nthen looking at it means nothing.\n\n979\n00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:24.480\nI could give you a book on Grey's Anatomy,\nor\n\n980\n00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.760\na book on surgery, or physics or whatever.\n\n981\n00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:30.270\nYou don't understand that, it's nothing.\n\n982\n00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:31.680\nIt literally means nothing to you.\n\n983\n00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.760\nIt's a paperweight.\n\n984\n00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.880\n>> Exactly.\n\n985\n00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:38.645\nAnd yeah, I'm with you there, and\nonce that trust is gone, it is hard to get\n\n986\n00:53:38.645 --> 00:53:44.010\nback, stop and think about the CA in\nChina that got compromised, we'll say.\n\n987\n00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:44.570\n>> Yeah.\n\n988\n00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:45.940\n>> It's hard to regain that trust.\n\n989\n00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.878\nIt is probably a good chance that they\nwill come back with another name.\n\n990\n00:53:49.878 --> 00:53:51.390\n[LAUGH] That'd be my thing.\n\n991\n00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:53.260\nI'd just open up another\nbusiness with a different name.\n\n992\n00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:56.760\n>> And call it like the Super Happy Fun\nCertificate or something like that.\n\n993\n00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.680\nThey're always creative with\ntheir names over there.\n\n994\n00:53:58.680 --> 00:53:59.404\nI love that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n995\n00:53:59.404 --> 00:54:00.060\n>> They definitely are.\n\n996\n00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:05.338\nAll right, well, Sean, that's a really\ngood in depth look I think of PKI,\n\n997\n00:54:05.338 --> 00:54:07.300\npublic key infrastructure.\n\n998\n00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:09.270\nAnd where, and how it works, and\n\n999\n00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:12.290\nwhere we might see that in\nthe world of cryptography.\n\n1000\n00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:15.090\nNot an all inclusive list by any means,\nbut\n\n1001\n00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:18.300\na couple good examples\nof where that ties in.\n\n1002\n00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.397\n>> Yeah.\n>> Anything else we wanna\n\n1003\n00:54:19.397 --> 00:54:21.119\nthrow out there before\nwe wrap this one up?\n\n1004\n00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:26.260\n>> I think I'll go with\nwhat you said on that.\n\n1005\n00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:31.540\nIt's just a couple of examples, but those\nare really, really good examples of it.\n\n1006\n00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.260\nEven though you may have seen them before,\n\n1007\n00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:37.040\nunderstand it, you're understanding\nwhat the overall process is.\n\n1008\n00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.340\nNow we're putting\nthe context of cryptography.\n\n1009\n00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:46.220\nSo now you can see how you're combining\nthings to get a solution because either\n\n1010\n00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:51.830\nSSL or digital signature, if I told\nyou to pick a piece of cryptographic\n\n1011\n00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:56.410\ntechnology to pull that off, you can't\ndo it with just one type of algorithm.\n\n1012\n00:54:56.410 --> 00:54:58.320\nThere's no way to do that.\n\n1013\n00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.610\nYou can't just use symmetric,\nasymmetric, or hashing.\n\n1014\n00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:06.000\nNone of those ones will get you\nanywhere near those solutions, but\n\n1015\n00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.100\nif you combine them,\nthen you can get a much,\n\n1016\n00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:14.280\nmuch better solution than you\nwould with any one of them alone.\n\n1017\n00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.260\nOr even create a solution that just wasn't\npossible with any one of them alone.\n\n1018\n00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:20.070\nAnd these aren't the only cases.\n\n1019\n00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:23.700\nThere's other cases where they do combine\ndifferent cryptographic techniques and\n\n1020\n00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:27.180\ntechnologies in exciting and unique ways.\n\n1021\n00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.310\nBut these are a couple of good ones.\n\n1022\n00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:33.620\nAnd notice the way they compare and\ncontrast with, not with the hashing or\n\n1023\n00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:38.640\nsymmetric side, but\nwith which the public and private key,\n\n1024\n00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:43.700\nwhat combinations of those they use\nbecause that's a significant part of it.\n\n1025\n00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:48.245\nSo while you have seen,\na lot of you have seen PKI before and\n\n1026\n00:55:48.245 --> 00:55:50.325\nunderstand what the whole\nalphabet soup and\n\n1027\n00:55:50.325 --> 00:55:54.555\nall that means, we're looking at it now\nfrom, hey, you know how to set it up.\n\n1028\n00:55:54.555 --> 00:55:56.933\nWe don't care about that part.\n\n1029\n00:55:56.933 --> 00:55:59.310\nIf you wanna go set it up, like Mike said,\n\n1030\n00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:05.910\nITPro has courses on how specifically we\nset those up on a Microsoft platform.\n\n1031\n00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:08.630\nBut if you want to do it otherwise,\n\n1032\n00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:13.800\nor look underneath the hood and really\nunderstand it, this is where you come in.\n\n1033\n00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:17.326\nAnd you have to know the stuff if you're\ngoing to be doing any sort of like,\n\n1034\n00:56:17.326 --> 00:56:21.960\nI think of PCI DSS, so\nthe payment card industry.\n\n1035\n00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:26.290\nI think of all the standards that\nalso go on top of financial and\n\n1036\n00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:31.220\nprivacy concerns and all those things,\nthose are all going to dictate\n\n1037\n00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:35.675\nnot how you set it up, but\nwhat algorithms you can choose.\n\n1038\n00:56:35.675 --> 00:56:42.290\n>> So that wasn't short, but that's just\nsomething I felt was worth throwing in.\n\n1039\n00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:43.480\n>> All right, good.\n\n1040\n00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.620\nAll right, well ladies and\ngentlemen we thank you for tuning in.\n\n1041\n00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:48.720\nWe hope you enjoyed today's episode.\n\n1042\n00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.430\nI wanna remind you guys if you\nhave a question during this show,\n\n1043\n00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:54.360\nall you have to do is jump down in\nthere in the chat room, type it in.\n\n1044\n00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:57.500\nWe're gonna see that live on air,\nwe're gonna respond to it live on air.\n\n1045\n00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.910\nIf you're watching a recording of this\nshow, you're not left out in the dark.\n\n1046\n00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:02.650\nUp at the top of every one of\nour pages is that Q&A link.\n\n1047\n00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:07.030\nAll you gotta do is click on that,\nit's gonna take you over to our forums.\n\n1048\n00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:08.670\nYou can post your question there.\n\n1049\n00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:11.300\nAll the hosts here at\nITProTV monitor the forums.\n\n1050\n00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:15.828\nWe're gonna get you the answer\nyou're looking for, so\n\n1051\n00:57:15.828 --> 00:57:18.340\nagain, thanks for tuning in.\n\n1052\n00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:25.520\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n1053\n00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.120\n>>

00:00:34.890\nGood morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening.\n\n5\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.380\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.330\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.120\nSean Oriyano, how you doing Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.070\n>> Doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n9\n00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.655\n>> I am doing fantastic,\n\n10\n00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:47.540\ncuz we have more of our cryptography\nepisodes coming your way.\n\n11\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.300\nToday we are gonna cover steganography.\n\n12\n00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.759\nPretty interesting topic here Sean,\nit fits right along it's just another type\n\n13\n00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:58.920\nof, well, it does fit into\nour cryptography episodes.\n\n14\n00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.518\nA little bit different though\nthan what we're used to, or\n\n15\n00:01:01.518 --> 00:01:04.130\nwhat we've dealt with in our\nprevious episodes, right?\n\n16\n00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.520\n>> Yes, it is decidedly different\nthan anything we've had before.\n\n17\n00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.009\nNow, it can be used in combination\nwith the stuff that we saw before, and\n\n18\n00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.890\nit frequently is, but\nit doesn't have to be.\n\n19\n00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.600\nSo it's something that just kinda\nfits under that same banner.\n\n20\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.313\nAnd it does tackle certain goals and\naccomplish certain tasks that,\n\n21\n00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:28.800\njust regular cryptography as we know it so\nfar, just can't do.\n\n22\n00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.030\nNo matter whether you're\ntalking classical or\n\n23\n00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.170\nyou're talking modern,\nthey just can't do it.\n\n24\n00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.260\nThey can't do the same thing that\nsteganography can so it solves or\n\n25\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.600\ntakes care of a very unique problem.\n\n26\n00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.830\nSo that's what we have going on here.\n\n27\n00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.262\n>> Yeah, it's a little different\nbecause with cryptography,\n\n28\n00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:50.222\nwe're encrypting this plaintext,\nturning it into ciphertext so that\n\n29\n00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:54.845\nit's not readable without the proper keys\nto be able to decrypt that information.\n\n30\n00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:56.975\nBut you can still see that\nthe information is there.\n\n31\n00:01:56.975 --> 00:02:01.311\nIf you think about it, if you encrypt\na file on your hard drive using EFS or\n\n32\n00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:05.861\nmy encrypting file system, part of NTFS,\nthe file is still there, right,\n\n33\n00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:08.795\nit turns green to show\nyou that it's encrypted.\n\n34\n00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.877\nAnd if you try to double click on it,\nyou can't open it if you\n\n35\n00:02:11.877 --> 00:02:15.990\ndon't have the right key, but\nyou can still see the file is still there.\n\n36\n00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.010\nSteganography takes a different approach,\nright?\n\n37\n00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.140\nIt's not taking plaintext and\nturning it into ciphertext.\n\n38\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.070\nWhat are we doing with steganography?\n\n39\n00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.585\n>> Steganography, to give you kind\nof a clue to where it's going, if\n\n40\n00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:33.065\nyou're unaware of it, is they frequently\nrefer to as hiding in plain sight.\n\n41\n00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:38.795\nWhich really kind of sums up the whole\nconcept once you understand it.\n\n42\n00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:41.395\nThat's really it,\nis you are hiding in plain sight.\n\n43\n00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:43.217\nAnd what you're doing\nwith steganography is,\n\n44\n00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:45.610\nwe're doing a little bit of\na terminology shift here.\n\n45\n00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.260\nWhat we do is we're embedding\nsomething inside of something else.\n\n46\n00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.516\nAnd what that is, is we're embedding\nsomething like plaintext or\n\n47\n00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:57.708\na payload inside something\nthey call cover text,\n\n48\n00:02:57.708 --> 00:03:02.510\nwhich is the actual item that is gonna\nbe holding this hidden information.\n\n49\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.806\nNow how you get that information,\nthat secret that you want and\n\n50\n00:03:06.806 --> 00:03:11.040\nweave it into this other item is,\nthere's many techniques.\n\n51\n00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.080\nLet's just put it out there, many\ndifferent techniques to accomplish that.\n\n52\n00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.587\nBut no matter which way you look at it,\nyou are doing something in such a way that\n\n53\n00:03:19.587 --> 00:03:24.031\nsomeone looking at that without\nknowledge that something's hidden there,\n\n54\n00:03:24.031 --> 00:03:26.100\nis just not gonna know it's there.\n\n55\n00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.130\nThey're gonna go right on by and\ntreat it at face value.\n\n56\n00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.280\nThey're not gonna look for these other\nlittle details kind of hidden in there.\n\n57\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.880\n>> So I might take a secret formula\nthat I have, and I might choose to\n\n58\n00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.260\nuse steganography and embed that\ndata into an image, for example.\n\n59\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.750\nAnd now that image doesn't change, and\n\n60\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.680\nit's not perceivable to\nthe human eye anyway.\n\n61\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.992\nSo now you might go to my computer or\nyou might pop in my thumb drive and\n\n62\n00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:54.680\nyou see a picture, and\nit looks like a normal picture.\n\n63\n00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.260\nAnd you double click on it and it opens\nup and you can look at the picture.\n\n64\n00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.900\nNo problem, because you don't even know,\n\n65\n00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.740\nthere's no indication that there's\nany data hidden within that image.\n\n66\n00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.380\nSo, as you said, we're just hiding\nit right there in plain sight.\n\n67\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.690\nAnd the data's not encrypted, right, Sean?\n\n68\n00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.450\nIt's not encrypted, it doesn't have to be-\n>> But it can.\n\n69\n00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.800\n>> Yeah, most programs will do that\nas an extra layer of protection.\n\n70\n00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.710\nWhat they'll do is they'll take the file,\nrun it through something, and\n\n71\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.930\nthen take whatever that is and\nput it inside the cover text.\n\n72\n00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.420\n>> So I might take my plaintext,\nconvert it to ciphertext, and\n\n73\n00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.920\nthen embed my ciphertext into an image.\n\n74\n00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.092\nSo first you gotta find out\nthat the data's even there.\n\n75\n00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:41.260\nYou've gotta somehow realize that this\npicture contains additional information.\n\n76\n00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.910\nAnd even if you do figure that out and\n\n77\n00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.690\nyou're able to extract that,\nyou've extracted encrypted text.\n\n78\n00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.300\nAnd now you've gotta somehow break\nthat encryption that's on there.\n\n79\n00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.170\nSo it can act like a second layer.\n\n80\n00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.646\n>> Yeah they can do many\ntransformations on it before\n\n81\n00:04:53.646 --> 00:04:58.960\nthey even get to the point of\nembedding it inside this cover text.\n\n82\n00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.110\nInvisible Secrets would be one that\nwe've seen in prior classes that,\n\n83\n00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.860\nwhat it does, is it actually takes\nthe information, compresses it,\n\n84\n00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.070\nencrypts it, and then sticks it\ninside of an image of your choosing.\n\n85\n00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.740\nSo you can see it's doing\ntwo operations there.\n\n86\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.180\nAnd so yeah, you're right, if someone were\nable to detect it, that's the first step.\n\n87\n00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.900\nThey have to detect that it's there.\n\n88\n00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.130\nOnce they detect it and\nthey extract the information,\n\n89\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.490\nthe next thing is that now they got\nto break that key, whatever it is.\n\n90\n00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.713\nAnd if you're talking about\nInvisible Secrets, they use AES and\n\n91\n00:05:35.713 --> 00:05:38.260\nwe already know what the deal is there.\n\n92\n00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.386\nSo they've really bumped things up\non you way, way, way, way, way up.\n\n93\n00:05:42.386 --> 00:05:45.020\n>> So steganography, again,\nit gives me the ability\n\n94\n00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.500\nto hide that information in plain sight,\nand so what the bad guys are doing, or\n\n95\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.380\nmaybe the good guys,\ntrying to keep it from the bad guys.\n\n96\n00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.690\nAgain, if somebody was to\nexamine my thumb drive,\n\n97\n00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.556\nthey'd see a whole series of pictures,\nor a bunch of MP3 files.\n\n98\n00:05:58.556 --> 00:06:02.070\nAnd so if I, hopefully, the idea\n\n99\n00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.130\nis that they're not gonna realize that\nthere's additional data embedded in there.\n\n100\n00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.570\nAnd this is not a new technique, right?\n\n101\n00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.650\nThis has been going on, just as we talked\nabout, encryption has been going on since,\n\n102\n00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.710\nwe know of,\nall the way back to the Egyptian days.\n\n103\n00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.750\nMost likely further than that.\n\n104\n00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.800\nSteganography is not new, as well.\n\n105\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.930\n>> Yeah, it's been there for\na long, long, long time.\n\n106\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:27.980\nIt just maybe hasn't been given a name,\nor whatever you want to call it,\n\n107\n00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.870\nbut it's gone under a lot, come in a lot\nof different forms over the years.\n\n108\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.050\nAnd they always do the same thing\nno matter where you see it.\n\n109\n00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.110\nIt hides something in such a way that\nunless you deliberately know it's\n\n110\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.340\nthere and go looking for it,\nyou're not gonna see it.\n\n111\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.580\nWhich is the big benefit that it has,\nby the way, over standard cryptography.\n\n112\n00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.150\nCryptography encrypts something,\nas you're saying, you know it's encrypted.\n\n113\n00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.330\nYou were mentioning that in Windows\nit turns the files a different color.\n\n114\n00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.439\nEven if it wasn't that, if you looked at a\npiece of plaintext and see it's encrypted,\n\n115\n00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:08.480\nyou immediately are gonna say, okay\nthey're trying to keep something from me.\n\n116\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.720\nSo it's immediately got your attention.\n\n117\n00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.020\nSteganography counters that by saying, I'm\njust not gonna let you know it's there.\n\n118\n00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.310\nI could encrypt it as well, but\nI'm gonna encrypt it before I embed it.\n\n119\n00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.980\nTherefore, it doesn't draw\nyour attention to it, and\n\n120\n00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.340\ntherefore you're not gonna, hopefully,\nmake any attempt to break it.\n\n121\n00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.160\nOr at least it's going to slow\nyou down substantially, so\n\n122\n00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.920\nthat's really the magic of this.\n\n123\n00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.920\nBut as we go back in history\nit's the same type of thing.\n\n124\n00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.250\nIs that they've had all these different\ntechniques of hiding information in\n\n125\n00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.110\na place where you would not go looking for\nit.\n\n126\n00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.816\nAnd therefore someone can just pass\ncompletely undetected with a secret\n\n127\n00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:47.220\nmessage or whatever it is.\n\n128\n00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.487\n>> It makes me think of the spy\nworld always, cuz as a spy,\n\n129\n00:07:50.487 --> 00:07:53.839\nthere's always that chance\nthat you might get caught.\n\n130\n00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:57.661\nAnd if I've got a thumb drive full of\nencrypted files, I'm gonna have a hard\n\n131\n00:07:57.661 --> 00:08:01.480\ntime saying that I'm not a spy, or\nwhatever the case may be, but if I've got\n\n132\n00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.560\na thumb drive full of pictures, maybe\npart of my cover is I'm a tourist, right?\n\n133\n00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.166\nAnd I've got all these pictures\nof different tourist spots and\n\n134\n00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:10.279\nthings like that, and\nmaybe I can get away with it,\n\n135\n00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:13.500\nbecause they don't see that there's\ndata embedded in those images.\n\n136\n00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.500\nSo this is really when encryption does\na good job of keeping the bad guys out, or\n\n137\n00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.780\nkeeping it only to the authorized\npeople of that information.\n\n138\n00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:26.500\nBut steganography is when we have to hide\nthe fact that we've got the information in\n\n139\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.230\nthe first place,\nis really what it comes down to.\n\n140\n00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.590\n>> Yeah, it's almost adding on if you\nlook at the CIA triad and you've got,\n\n141\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:38.380\nyou look at the confidentiality part,\ncryptography very clearly does that.\n\n142\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.938\nAnything we've seen so far does that.\n\n143\n00:08:40.938 --> 00:08:45.839\nSteganography you could say\nadds another C to the CIA, and\n\n144\n00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:48.848\nit does concealment on top of that.\n\n145\n00:08:48.848 --> 00:08:50.810\nSo, it's not just keeping it confidential.\n\n146\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.940\nIt completely conceals it.\n\n147\n00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.710\nSo, it's adding an extra layer, and\nso that's always been the trick and\n\n148\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:02.570\nthe magic with steganography, and\nno matter what form you look at it,\n\n149\n00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.420\nit's always been the same way,\nand you're right.\n\n150\n00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.930\nA lot of it has been in the spy role\nthough, and transmit information and\n\n151\n00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.400\nsecret messages that way, and\nsome of the earliest examples of it.\n\n152\n00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.300\nThey had, it was known a couple thousand\n\n153\n00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.580\nyears ago that they would send\nmessages through couriers,\n\n154\n00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.290\nand the Roman Empire and places like that,\n\n155\n00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.913\nthey would just grab someone\nthat was unfortunate.\n\n156\n00:09:32.913 --> 00:09:35.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They just grab someone-\n\n157\n00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.588\n>> So, need the whole volunteer thing and\n\n158\n00:09:37.588 --> 00:09:40.310\nif I stand in a row and\nthey say we need a volunteer and-\n\n159\n00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.890\n>> Yeah.\n\n160\n00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.350\n>> everybody else steps back and\nyou reach that deal right there.\n\n161\n00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.060\n>> Yep-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n162\n00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.230\n>> which still works today by the way.\n\n163\n00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.680\n>> Yeah, it does.\n\n164\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.888\nBut they would just get somebody,\nand what they would do is usually\n\n165\n00:09:51.888 --> 00:09:56.550\nthere was a server or\nsomething like that of that standing.\n\n166\n00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.486\nAnd what they were, one of the techniques\nthat they used was they would shave\n\n167\n00:10:00.486 --> 00:10:03.500\ntheir head, and\nthen tattoo the message on their scalp and\n\n168\n00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.100\nlet their hair grow back,\nand then send them out.\n\n169\n00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.390\nAnd-\n>> Wow.\n\n170\n00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.953\n>> it doesn't work as fast as\nwe would want nowadays but then,\n\n171\n00:10:10.953 --> 00:10:15.232\nthe way the order of battle and other\nstuff worked was just a lot slower so\n\n172\n00:10:15.232 --> 00:10:18.600\nif you're sending information\nthat way it would work.\n\n173\n00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.577\nAnd all you have to do is just tell\nthat person get to this point,\n\n174\n00:10:22.577 --> 00:10:26.707\nand they're gonna be able to walk\nright on through wherever, and\n\n175\n00:10:26.707 --> 00:10:31.310\nunless someone knows that it's there,\nthey're not gonna go looking.\n\n176\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.180\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n177\n00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.047\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> And\n\n178\n00:10:34.047 --> 00:10:35.180\nthe other guy at the other end\nhas to get his head shaved and.\n\n179\n00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:35.930\n>> Yeah.\n\n180\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.020\n>> As an example, and I know you got\nsome other really good examples of where\n\n181\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.060\nwe see this type of, I don't know if\nI really wanna call it encryption.\n\n182\n00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.452\nSo where we see steganography, maybe they\ndidn't call it steganography at the time,\n\n183\n00:10:48.452 --> 00:10:50.930\nbut you've got some really\ngood examples here.\n\n184\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.228\n>> Yeah, it's really tough when you\nget into this, cuz yeah, there's so\n\n185\n00:10:55.228 --> 00:10:59.890\nmany just neat examples of this and\nlittle things they've done along the way.\n\n186\n00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:03.764\nOne I had mentioned in a prior episode,\nand\n\n187\n00:11:03.764 --> 00:11:08.929\nI believe I had also mentioned\nit in our forensics class,\n\n188\n00:11:08.929 --> 00:11:11.850\njust a kind of a piece of trivia.\n\n189\n00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.980\nWas one of the techniques that had\nbeen developed both in Europe and\n\n190\n00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.928\nin Japan,\nwas the one of using boiled eggs, and\n\n191\n00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:23.230\nusing a special ink that would put\nthe stuff on the surface of the egg.\n\n192\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.794\nThen all you had to do is just peel it,\nand either read it directly, or you dunked\n\n193\n00:11:27.794 --> 00:11:32.450\nit in a dye, and it revealed it, and so\nthat's plain and simple steganography.\n\n194\n00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.030\nIf you're doing it with an ink that\ncan't be seen unless you dye it, and\n\n195\n00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:41.500\nunless you peel that shell off, then you\nknow you've got a pretty effective method.\n\n196\n00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.120\nSomeone's gonna have to search\nevery egg that comes by.\n\n197\n00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Can you imagine that?\n\n198\n00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.690\nIt just, it's gonna be a real,\nreal big pain.\n\n199\n00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.270\nAnd then on top of it, they'll have to\nknow the solution that they have to\n\n200\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.920\nmix to actually reveal that message,\nor make it develop.\n\n201\n00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.640\nSo, you've got kind of a tall order there,\nand it worked for a good long time.\n\n202\n00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.480\nSo it's just one of the interesting ones\nthat the ancient world came up with.\n\n203\n00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.463\nThen they also different ones,\ntattoos as mentioned,\n\n204\n00:12:13.463 --> 00:12:17.030\ntattooing the head was an old technique.\n\n205\n00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:21.218\nThey still use it,\nnot necessarily tattooing the head for\n\n206\n00:12:21.218 --> 00:12:26.270\nthat reason, but you will get,\nthe world of people getting tattoos.\n\n207\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.896\nYou will see that some of the tattoos\ndo carry meanings to only those\n\n208\n00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:33.480\npeople that would know that\nmeaning's there in the first place.\n\n209\n00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.020\n>> Right.\n\n210\n00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:39.039\n>> To everyone else, it looks like\na piece of artwork, or what have you,\n\n211\n00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:43.310\nbut the ones that actually kind\nof know what the end deal is.\n\n212\n00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.980\nThe ones I think are like\nthe jailhouse tattoo-\n\n213\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:46.600\n>> Yeah.\n\n214\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.970\n>> stuff like that, you know the tear,\nand I guess there's a spider web one.\n\n215\n00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.140\nI've never been to prison, sorry.\n\n216\n00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.782\n>> I know some of you have\nmentioned the show CSI, for\n\n217\n00:12:54.782 --> 00:12:59.140\nthose of us here in the US,\nCSI Crime Scene Investigation.\n\n218\n00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.757\nThey've got a new series they've\ncome out with called CSI Cyber, and\n\n219\n00:13:02.757 --> 00:13:05.340\nI happened to watch the pilot\nepisode last night.\n\n220\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.770\nI'm a little behind, and\nit was that very thing.\n\n221\n00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:13.730\nOne of the guys that, they had\ngathered up all these bad guys and\n\n222\n00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:19.360\nthey needed the combination, they needed\na password to get into this website, and\n\n223\n00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.960\nit was a 20 character password.\n\n224\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.080\nAnd so they were looking at these guys,\nand they kinda just said, but\n\n225\n00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.370\nthere's no way these guys are remembering\nsome 20 character password.\n\n226\n00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.320\nSo it's gotta be written somewhere, and\nshe had noticed this guy's tattoo and\n\n227\n00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.040\nit had a date on there.\n\n228\n00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.766\nAnd he said oh, that was the day my\nmama croaked, or something like that.\n\n229\n00:13:35.766 --> 00:13:37.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They had him taking off his shirt, and\n\n230\n00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.100\nhe's got tattoos of different people\nall over him, all with these dates, and\n\n231\n00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.150\nso each one of those dates was\na six digit number combination, and\n\n232\n00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.690\nthey were able to figure out that that\nwas the actual password on his website.\n\n233\n00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:53.400\nSo just an example, obviously a little bit\nof Hollywood, but same kinda idea, right?\n\n234\n00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.516\nIf you didn’t know,\n\n235\n00:13:54.516 --> 00:13:57.930\nit looks like he had little memorials\ntattooed all over his body.\n\n236\n00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:01.405\nBut come to find out, that was actually\nthe password, or the combination\n\n237\n00:14:01.405 --> 00:14:04.890\nof those numbers, was the password to\nget into this website or whatever.\n\n238\n00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.300\n>> Yeah it would work.\n\n239\n00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.710\nThat cuts right to the core\nof what steganography does.\n\n240\n00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.240\n>> Hiding it right there in plain sight.\n\n241\n00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:21.010\n>> Yep, that one, I don't see any\nreason why you couldn't use that.\n\n242\n00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.641\nSo but, anyway yeah,\nyou've got the tattoos ones, and\n\n243\n00:14:25.641 --> 00:14:28.640\ninvisible ink is really old school.\n\n244\n00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.503\nIt's something that hasn't,\nisn't brand new, it's been done with milk,\n\n245\n00:14:33.503 --> 00:14:38.160\nit's been done with lemon juice,\nit's been done with other stuff, too.\n\n246\n00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.390\nThe have specially developed ink.\n\n247\n00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.150\n>> We don't wanna go there, but I think\nI know what example you're thinking of.\n\n248\n00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.710\nWe played this as kids,\nI remember getting invisible ink, or\n\n249\n00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:53.502\nsomething like that and writing messages,\nand then only if you colored over it with\n\n250\n00:14:53.502 --> 00:14:57.350\na different marker would the message\nshow up and things like that.\n\n251\n00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.700\nI think you're hinting towards, we've all\nseen the crime shows where they break out\n\n252\n00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.537\nthe black light, and you don't wanna\ndo that in a hotel room obviously,\n\n253\n00:15:03.537 --> 00:15:05.140\nbecause you might not sleep on that bed.\n\n254\n00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.809\n>> Well we can put it really\ngently on this one without, and\n\n255\n00:15:08.809 --> 00:15:12.100\nyou get to do the research\non it if you feel like it.\n\n256\n00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.100\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n257\n00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.810\n>> Because we ain't going to do that here.\n\n258\n00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:21.004\nBut there was, during a during\nWorld War II the British home office\n\n259\n00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:26.197\ntold their spies in the field that,\nthey would advise them on how to\n\n260\n00:15:26.197 --> 00:15:32.640\nwrite messages using invisible ink, and\nwe''ll just drop a couple clues here.\n\n261\n00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.593\nAnd you'd probably connect the dots, they\ntold all their male spies out in the field\n\n262\n00:15:37.593 --> 00:15:41.310\nthat they had a source of ink\nunique to them that they could use.\n\n263\n00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.020\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n264\n00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.890\n>> So you figure it out.\n\n265\n00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.770\n>> Yeah.\n\n266\n00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.680\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n267\n00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.180\n>> And you got Mike's black light comment,\nso you probably got it.\n\n268\n00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.964\n>> There you go.\nPut the two together and\n\n269\n00:15:51.964 --> 00:15:57.391\nyou'll figure out how men might have\nan unlimited supply of invisible ink.\n\n270\n00:15:57.391 --> 00:16:01.366\nBut you know it's just another example\nof where you're talking about hiding\n\n271\n00:16:01.366 --> 00:16:05.050\ninformation in plain sight,\nwhatever the medium that you're using.\n\n272\n00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.051\nYou write out a message, it disappears,\nit just looks like a piece a paper.\n\n273\n00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:12.658\nAnybody finds it, they have no idea that\nthey need to apply a certain technique to\n\n274\n00:16:12.658 --> 00:16:15.520\nactually reveal that secret information.\n\n275\n00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.324\nIn fact, the document could have other\nthings written on it in normal ink and\n\n276\n00:16:20.324 --> 00:16:24.002\nit might look like an article or\nsomething very innocent,\n\n277\n00:16:24.002 --> 00:16:27.250\na letter from a girlfriend or\nsomething like that.\n\n278\n00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.263\nAnd only if you know to apply\na certain technique to it,\n\n279\n00:16:30.263 --> 00:16:31.844\ndoes that message come out.\n\n280\n00:16:31.844 --> 00:16:37.437\nYeah and when I think of what\nyou're just saying about something\n\n281\n00:16:37.437 --> 00:16:42.731\nbeing printed on it,\nthat would be a very, very good cover.\n\n282\n00:16:42.731 --> 00:16:46.389\nI mean, you said I'd have a blank\nsheet of paper there, that's kind of,\n\n283\n00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:47.453\nwould be kind of odd.\n\n284\n00:16:47.453 --> 00:16:48.312\n>> That'd be, yeah.\n\n285\n00:16:48.312 --> 00:16:49.950\n>> So if you just hand it to them,\nwhy is that?\n\n286\n00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.201\n>> Why are you carrying around this\nblank piece of paper like it's special,\n\n287\n00:16:53.201 --> 00:16:55.400\nin an envelope and\nall folded up and protected.\n\n288\n00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:55.924\n>> Yeah, exactly,\nit just doesn't make sense.\n\n289\n00:16:55.924 --> 00:16:57.460\n>> It might look to obvious.\n\n290\n00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.850\nIt's like, it has sentimental value.\n\n291\n00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.739\nNo, it doesn't.\n>> [LAUGH] It's my favorite\n\n292\n00:17:00.739 --> 00:17:01.830\npiece of paper.\n\n293\n00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.875\n>> Yeah, that was the first one\nthat got jammed in that printer.\n\n294\n00:17:03.875 --> 00:17:08.461\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the one I think of they did in,\n\n295\n00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:13.181\nwhat was that first one\nthat Nicolas Cage did?\n\n296\n00:17:13.181 --> 00:17:14.412\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n297\n00:17:14.412 --> 00:17:18.320\n>> What's the one where he was doing-\n>> Was that the prison one, Con Air?\n\n298\n00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:23.210\n>> No, the one where he was looking for\ntreasures inside the US.\n\n299\n00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.430\n>> Oh yeah,\nI know what you're talking about.\n\n300\n00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:29.520\nI don't know what it's called but, yup,\nthey use some invisible ink in there?\n\n301\n00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.782\n>> Yeah, I remember cuz they had one,\nsomeone's gonna come up with it,\n\n302\n00:17:33.782 --> 00:17:34.603\n>> Yeah, come on,\n\n303\n00:17:34.603 --> 00:17:37.427\nall my trivia buffs out there,\nwhat was the, National?\n\n304\n00:17:37.427 --> 00:17:38.600\n>> National Treasure, was that it?\n\n305\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.933\n>> Maybe it was National Treasure,\none of those Nicolas Cage movies.\n\n306\n00:17:40.933 --> 00:17:45.782\n>> But they had the first movie where\nthey had invisible ink on the back of\n\n307\n00:17:45.782 --> 00:17:50.890\nthe Declaration of Independence and\nthey took lemon juice to it.\n\n308\n00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:55.760\nAnd that would be something that would\nconceivably work for the same thing.\n\n309\n00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.341\nYou've got a document,\njust go to the other side and\n\n310\n00:17:58.341 --> 00:18:01.283\ndo something to it to reveal it,\nit absolutely would work.\n\n311\n00:18:01.283 --> 00:18:03.041\nAnd the thing with invisible ink,\n\n312\n00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:06.020\nit's not always the same thing\nthat's gonna develop it.\n\n313\n00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.570\nIt could be heat,\nthat was the one that a lot of kids used.\n\n314\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:13.050\nDo it with milk and then, boom,\nover a light, heat's gonna reveal it.\n\n315\n00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.500\nBut it could be a lot of different\nthings that actually reveal it.\n\n316\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.050\nSo it may not be as simple as well,\nhere you gotta sheet of paper,\n\n317\n00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.390\nhold it over a light bulb.\n\n318\n00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.048\nI mean,\n\n319\n00:18:21.048 --> 00:18:25.390\nthat may not be enough, but anyway-\n>> And then the one, I love this one\n\n320\n00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.875\ncuz this one always makes me think of\nthe early spy movies and things like that.\n\n321\n00:18:28.875 --> 00:18:30.435\nMicrodots, right?\n\n322\n00:18:30.435 --> 00:18:34.835\n>> Yeah, microdots are ones that you\ndon't see nearly as much as you used to.\n\n323\n00:18:34.835 --> 00:18:37.937\nThey're still there but\nyou just don't see them nearly as much.\n\n324\n00:18:37.937 --> 00:18:41.217\nIn fact, I've got kinda somewhat\nan example on the screen to just give you\n\n325\n00:18:41.217 --> 00:18:43.837\nidea what a microdot would look like.\n\n326\n00:18:43.837 --> 00:18:45.307\nSo here's a stamp, and\n\n327\n00:18:45.307 --> 00:18:49.757\nthat little thing out there's supposed to\nrepresent the size of an average microdot.\n\n328\n00:18:49.757 --> 00:18:52.450\nThey could be even smaller than that.\n\n329\n00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:57.450\nAnd the thing is that this is\nactually a little obvious, unless\n\n330\n00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.658\nthey move it over and put it on her-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:18:59.658 --> 00:19:00.715\n>> It's not [CROSSTALK]\n\n332\n00:19:00.715 --> 00:19:01.240\n>> What is this coming out of\n\n333\n00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.944\nQueen Elizabeth's nose there?\n\n334\n00:19:01.944 --> 00:19:04.160\n>> Yeah, put it on a cheek.\n\n335\n00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:04.800\n>> It's a big mole.\n\n336\n00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.720\n>> That's a melanoma.\n\n337\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.350\n>> Yeah, so [LAUGH]\n>> Or she's Cindy Crawford.\n\n338\n00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.931\n>> But these things are very, they can fit\nan incredible amount of information in\n\n339\n00:19:10.931 --> 00:19:11.881\na period on a piece of paper.\n\n340\n00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:16.969\n>> Yeah, this microdot,\nthey would take a jeweler's eyepiece,\n\n341\n00:19:16.969 --> 00:19:21.693\nwould be one of the ways, or\nthey also had special cameras.\n\n342\n00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:26.360\nAnd what they would do is just lay it over\nthis, and it would be like a microfilm.\n\n343\n00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:32.780\nSo we're assuming everyone's seen\nmicrofilm, but that's what it is.\n\n344\n00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.676\nIt would just reveal these things, and\n\n345\n00:19:35.676 --> 00:19:41.050\nyou could hide these things on things\nlike newspaper print or wherever.\n\n346\n00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:45.856\nAnd all someone has to do is know, well,\nit's there, and then just go after it.\n\n347\n00:19:45.856 --> 00:19:49.395\nThey're very, very, very easy to conceal.\n\n348\n00:19:49.395 --> 00:19:53.630\n>> Yeah, I always think of, like a book,\nI mean how much type is in a book?\n\n349\n00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:58.490\nIf it's a 500 page novel and let's say ten\nof the periods out of the thousands of\n\n350\n00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.260\nperiods that are in there\nactually contain information.\n\n351\n00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.170\nYou'd have to one, know to look for\n\n352\n00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.950\nthe information,\nthen you have to examine every bit of that\n\n353\n00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.950\ndocument at a microscopic level to\nactually find this information.\n\n354\n00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:14.935\nSo a great way to hide information\nright there in plain sight.\n\n355\n00:20:14.935 --> 00:20:18.700\n>> Well,\nI don't know if it's intentional or\n\n356\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:23.180\nnot on your part, but\nthey did do things like that.\n\n357\n00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.150\nThey would put a microdot in a book.\n\n358\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.320\nAnd the way they would do\nit is someone would go and\n\n359\n00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.240\nto pass a message in a library,\ndo one of those dead drops.\n\n360\n00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.790\nThey would put the microdot on\na specific location in the book.\n\n361\n00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:38.460\nAnd then what they would do is\nthey would take that book and\n\n362\n00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.200\ncheck it out from the library.\n\n363\n00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.410\nAnd then put that dot in there, and\n\n364\n00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:46.430\nthen put it back in\nthe library at a specific spot.\n\n365\n00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:51.485\nAnd they could write a letter\nto somebody saying that this is\n\n366\n00:20:51.485 --> 00:20:58.530\nsomething like 12th shelf, top shelf,\n10th book over, page whatever.\n\n367\n00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.595\nOr they could write a message saying oh,\nI was reading this and\n\n368\n00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:04.560\nI thought you might enjoy it.\n\n369\n00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.549\nIt says oh, pay particular attention to\nthe events that happen on this page cuz\n\n370\n00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:08.879\nthat really caught my attention.\n\n371\n00:21:08.879 --> 00:21:13.700\nAnd that would be someones cue to go\nlook at that page and find the microdot.\n\n372\n00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.790\n>> If it's anybody else they would think\nthey were talking about the book and\n\n373\n00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.700\nthen there was nothing out\nof the ordinary about that.\n\n374\n00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.390\n>> Yeah, and in fact, if you look at the\nway the letter is being constructed and\n\n375\n00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.812\nthe fact that we're putting\na microdot in a book,\n\n376\n00:21:24.812 --> 00:21:26.961\nyou're using steganography twice there.\n\n377\n00:21:26.961 --> 00:21:27.599\n>> Right.\n>> Because\n\n378\n00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:29.580\nsomeone has to understand the context\nof what the letter is and\n\n379\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.535\nthen they have to go to the microdot,\nwhich is the other one.\n\n380\n00:21:31.535 --> 00:21:35.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And those type of things absolutely,\n\n381\n00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.060\npositively were done.\n\n382\n00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.766\nThey would do those things\nto cover things up.\n\n383\n00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:41.741\n>> Right.\n\n384\n00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:44.270\n>> So really just clever.\n\n385\n00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.311\n>> And then you've got Velvalee Dickson,\nDickinson.\n\n386\n00:21:47.311 --> 00:21:47.960\n>> Dickinson.\n\n387\n00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.672\n>> Dickinson,\nlet me get her name correct there.\n\n388\n00:21:50.672 --> 00:21:51.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What's her story,\n\n389\n00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.720\nhow's she fit in all this?\n\n390\n00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.417\n>> She is one of the ones that\nkinda fits into this because\n\n391\n00:21:57.417 --> 00:22:01.372\nshe was around here during\nthe Second World War in the US.\n\n392\n00:22:01.372 --> 00:22:07.510\nAnd she was a sympathizer\nwith the Axis powers.\n\n393\n00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.718\nAnd what she was doing is,\nI have an example, or\n\n394\n00:22:10.718 --> 00:22:14.583\na snippet of one of the letters\nthat she sent on my screen.\n\n395\n00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:19.749\nAnd you kinda look at it and\nshe's talking about doing her chores,\n\n396\n00:22:19.749 --> 00:22:24.930\nand then she's talking about this\nlovely Siamese temple dancer.\n\n397\n00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.670\nAnd then she says she found a second,\na plain ordinary doll, and\n\n398\n00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.020\nthen she has a second Siam doll.\n\n399\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.843\nIt's like, okay, this woman had a shop\nthat she actually bought and sold dolls.\n\n400\n00:22:35.843 --> 00:22:39.540\nAnd so this didn't look out of character.\n\n401\n00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:44.028\nAnd she was sending them to people\noverseas that were supposedly buying dolls\n\n402\n00:22:44.028 --> 00:22:44.657\nfrom her.\n\n403\n00:22:44.657 --> 00:22:49.509\n>> Uh-huh, I'm trying to purchase a few\nforeign ones no longer in the shops.\n\n404\n00:22:49.509 --> 00:22:52.200\nSo it gives you a reason to be\ntalking to people overseas.\n\n405\n00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.140\n>> Yeah, so she's got that part of it.\n\n406\n00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.560\nThen, but\nwhat this is actually saying, and\n\n407\n00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.520\nyou can look up Velvalee Dickinson's name.\n\n408\n00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.809\nFBI's got a whole case on her.\n\n409\n00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:06.373\nWhat those things are-\n>> Yeah, I threw a link,\n\n410\n00:23:06.373 --> 00:23:07.969\nI don't know if our chat\nroom is refreshing,\n\n411\n00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:09.570\nI'll double check on\nthat at our break here.\n\n412\n00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.728\nBut I do have a link for\nyou guys, I'll share it with you.\n\n413\n00:23:11.728 --> 00:23:13.098\n>> That'd be cool.\n\n414\n00:23:13.098 --> 00:23:16.556\nBut what these ones are is that\nif you read it, it's like okay,\n\n415\n00:23:16.556 --> 00:23:19.320\nyou can see it's talking\nabout repairing dolls.\n\n416\n00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.400\nOne of these things it says,\nshe says one of these things has been,\n\n417\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.680\nit's torn in the middle but\nis now repaired.\n\n418\n00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.530\nAnd then she says, she couldn't\nget a mate for this Siam dancer.\n\n419\n00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:34.410\nThen you go down the list,\nor you go down this, and\n\n420\n00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.950\nshe says,\nshe's talking about other things.\n\n421\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.800\nFuture production will be rather\nsmaller than the original paired one.\n\n422\n00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:44.020\nWhat those actually were, those were\ncode words for ships moving in and\n\n423\n00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.060\nout of the harbor.\n\n424\n00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.924\n>> Really?\n>> That's what those were.\n\n425\n00:23:46.924 --> 00:23:51.380\nEach one of the doll's name,\neach one of the doll's types, and\n\n426\n00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.290\nstuff like that referred to\na specific class of ship.\n\n427\n00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.810\nThat one tore in the middle probably\ngot hit by a torpedo strike.\n\n428\n00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.491\n>> Or got shot or something like that,\nand took major damage there.\n\n429\n00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:05.324\nSo she was saying specifically,\nthat was it,\n\n430\n00:24:05.324 --> 00:24:09.271\nshe was passing these messages back and\nforth.\n\n431\n00:24:09.271 --> 00:24:13.625\nBut what started to make this\nthing unravel is that she\n\n432\n00:24:13.625 --> 00:24:17.010\nstarted coming into a lot of money, and so\n\n433\n00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:22.334\nthat started attracting attention,\nand there was a couple other\n\n434\n00:24:22.334 --> 00:24:27.500\nthings that kind of popped an FBI\ninvestigator and found this.\n\n435\n00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:32.372\nSo she was caught, but there's a whole\nsequence of letters that that went\n\n436\n00:24:32.372 --> 00:24:35.450\nback and forth for\nan extended period of time.\n\n437\n00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:39.912\nAnd they all look like this,\ntalking about how she just\n\n438\n00:24:39.912 --> 00:24:44.405\ncollected this type of doll or\nthat type of a doll.\n\n439\n00:24:44.405 --> 00:24:49.915\nAnd like I said, every doll referred\nto a specific class or type of ship.\n\n440\n00:24:49.915 --> 00:24:55.365\nAnd the condition it was found in, or who\nit was with, or what pair it came with.\n\n441\n00:24:55.365 --> 00:24:58.782\nSaid hey, these guys came into port,\nthey left port.\n\n442\n00:24:58.782 --> 00:25:02.861\nHe says, I repaired it or whatever,\ntold that the ship had been repaired and\n\n443\n00:25:02.861 --> 00:25:03.570\ndried off.\n\n444\n00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.530\nYou know, those things were all there.\n\n445\n00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.600\nSo it's plain and simple steganography.\n\n446\n00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.720\nYou wouldn't know just by looking at it.\n\n447\n00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.530\nYou think oh, it's someone's crafting or\nhobby or something like that.\n\n448\n00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.250\n>> Hiding right there in plain sight.\n\n449\n00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.080\nAnd yeah, on that link for\nthe FBI they called her the Doll Woman.\n\n450\n00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.320\n>> Yeah, so it works.\n\n451\n00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.790\nLike I said, there's many cases.\n\n452\n00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.860\nAnd I can give you one\nmore real quick one here.\n\n453\n00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:35.150\nThis one on screen, these guys,\nunfortunate individuals.\n\n454\n00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:40.400\nThis is the USS Pueblo crew, and\njust a quick backstory on it.\n\n455\n00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.700\nUSS Pueblo is a spy ship that was, or\n\n456\n00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.750\na certain trunk surveillance\nship that the US had.\n\n457\n00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.780\nAnd it was captured by North Koreans\nin international waters.\n\n458\n00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.670\nAnd the ship is actually still there,\nit's in Pyongyang and\n\n459\n00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.350\nit's a tourist attraction there.\n\n460\n00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.040\n>> Really?\n\n461\n00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:01.660\n>> Yeah, and if you can believe it's\nthe only US ship that's still active that\n\n462\n00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.600\nis also in foreign control, it's there.\n\n463\n00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.560\nBut these guys,\nthe North Koreans captured the crew and\n\n464\n00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.530\nthey said along the way, they're like oh,\nwe're treating them fine,\n\n465\n00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:16.230\ndon't worry about it,\nthey're guests of our country, right?\n\n466\n00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.020\nAnd so they showed pictures like this,\nand you're like, oh, well, look,\n\n467\n00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:26.680\nthey don't exactly look happy, but\nthey look like they're in good condition.\n\n468\n00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.301\nIt's only when you start looking\nup close at these things.\n\n469\n00:26:30.301 --> 00:26:34.731\nAnd you look up close, you take a look\nat this guy's finger, right here,\n\n470\n00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:37.490\nhe's flipping off the camera.\n\n471\n00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:40.520\nThis guy over here is\ndoing the same thing.\n\n472\n00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.920\nAnd that was present in a lot\nof those pictures of this crew.\n\n473\n00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.170\nYou'd see the guys just\nflipping off the camera.\n\n474\n00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.540\nNorth Koreans didn't know what that meant.\n\n475\n00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.470\n>> Right.\n>> And so when they started\n\n476\n00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.260\nseeing these guys in pictures doing it,\nseveral pictures doing it,\n\n477\n00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.710\napparently one of them asked\nwhen the story came out later.\n\n478\n00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:04.127\nThey asked the guys, what does that\nmean that you're doing, they said oh,\n\n479\n00:27:04.127 --> 00:27:07.665\nI think they said it's like\nan Aloha high sign or something.\n\n480\n00:27:07.665 --> 00:27:10.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or a Hawaiian high sign or like that.\n\n481\n00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.015\n>> So now this way we can do it\nto the guards all day long and\n\n482\n00:27:12.015 --> 00:27:13.200\nthey'll think we're saying hello.\n\n483\n00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.182\n>> Yeah, to this day I picture\nNorth Koreans going around the country\n\n484\n00:27:16.182 --> 00:27:18.525\nsaying hi to each other by\nflipping each other off and\n\n485\n00:27:18.525 --> 00:27:20.620\nit just gives me a little\nwarm feeling inside.\n\n486\n00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.340\nBut anyway, that's just another one.\n\n487\n00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.430\nYou wouldn't know that.\n\n488\n00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:27.240\nThat actually worked in\nthe Vietnam war too.\n\n489\n00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.850\nThe Vietnamese I guess didn't\nget the note or whatever.\n\n490\n00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:34.152\nBut anyway, there you go,\nsome examples of it.\n\n491\n00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:37.200\n>> All right, well I tell you what,\nlooking at the clock, it's about time for\n\n492\n00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.050\nus to take one of those breaks.\n\n493\n00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.520\nWe're gonna step away for a minute.\n\n494\n00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.890\nWhen we come back, more on steganography.\n\n495\n00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:43.784\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n496\n00:27:43.784 --> 00:27:50.491\n[SOUND].\n\n497\n00:27:50.491 --> 00:27:52.230\nWelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n498\n00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.510\nSo, continuing on with our steganography.\n\n499\n00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:58.030\nI think the first thing we're gonna do is\njust a little demo to show you an example\n\n500\n00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:59.800\nof steganography.\n\n501\n00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.263\nSo, if I wanna pull up my screen here and\nshow you guys, I downloaded,\n\n502\n00:28:03.263 --> 00:28:05.180\nthis a program called QuickStego.\n\n503\n00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.220\nIt's available free on the Internet.\n\n504\n00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.900\nI'll dump a link in there as soon as\nI get my chat room working again.\n\n505\n00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:15.030\nBut all it is, it's a window where you see\nlike I'm gonna be able to pick an image\n\n506\n00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.780\nand put some text in there.\n\n507\n00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.510\nFor example, I gonna go over here and\n\n508\n00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:22.450\ngrab I actually got a copy\nof the Zimmerman note.\n\n509\n00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.700\nFigured that was appropriate for\nthis class.\n\n510\n00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.790\n>> Sounds good to me.\n\n511\n00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:27.390\n>> All right, so I got all this text.\n\n512\n00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:28.310\nI'm just gonna copy it.\n\n513\n00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.450\nAnd I'm gonna go over to my QuickStego,\nand I'm gonna pick an image.\n\n514\n00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.997\nI'll do a little Open, and\n\n515\n00:28:37.997 --> 00:28:43.086\nI happen to have out here on my Desktop,\n\n516\n00:28:43.086 --> 00:28:46.490\na picture that we can use.\n\n517\n00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:52.366\nAnd there we go, which is a cover\nof the incredibly good read,\n\n518\n00:28:52.366 --> 00:28:55.870\nCryptography by Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n519\n00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:56.780\nSo you pick a picture.\n\n520\n00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:57.370\n>> What can I say?\n\n521\n00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:00.150\n>> [LAUGH] And\nwe're gonna dump some text in here.\n\n522\n00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.450\nI'll just paste all that\ntext right in there.\n\n523\n00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:08.290\nAnd then we're gonna click on Hide Text.\n\n524\n00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.335\nAll right, and then at this point,\nI could save this image.\n\n525\n00:29:14.435 --> 00:29:16.955\nAnd I'll dump it out of my desktop and\nI'll call this one Hidden\n\n526\n00:29:18.145 --> 00:29:22.255\nso that I know which one's which.\n\n527\n00:29:22.255 --> 00:29:25.385\nI'll click Save and I'm done.\n\n528\n00:29:25.385 --> 00:29:27.373\nSo at this point, we can take a look.\n\n529\n00:29:27.373 --> 00:29:30.550\nIf I double-click on,\nthis is the original here, and\n\n530\n00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.940\nthis is the one that has\nthe hidden text in it.\n\n531\n00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.505\nSo I click on this original,\nthere's the JPEG, or the picture,\n\n532\n00:29:37.505 --> 00:29:39.580\nyeah in this case it is a JPEG.\n\n533\n00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.285\nAll right, and\nif I take a look at that other one.\n\n534\n00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.830\nWhoops, what did I?\n\n535\n00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:53.000\nOh, for some reason I've got BMPs\nopening up with my, let's edit that, or\n\n536\n00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.035\nopen that with something else here.\n\n537\n00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:02.130\nThere's the one that has\nthe hidden text in it.\n\n538\n00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:04.240\nAs you can see there's\nreally no difference.\n\n539\n00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.890\nI can't see any visible\ndifference in those two images.\n\n540\n00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:14.340\nAnd just to prove it,\nI'll close QuickStego, all right.\n\n541\n00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.530\nSo what I could do is I could send\nsomebody this image at this point.\n\n542\n00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:18.160\nAll right.\n\n543\n00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.370\nAnd only if they knew to look would\nthey go and be able to open that image.\n\n544\n00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:29.400\nScroll down and find that guy.\n\n545\n00:30:31.574 --> 00:30:32.494\nAnd ta-da!\n\n546\n00:30:32.494 --> 00:30:35.800\nThere is my hidden text within that image.\n\n547\n00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.110\nAll right.\nSo it's just a quick,\n\n548\n00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.350\neasy example of stego.\n\n549\n00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.960\nThis particular one doesn't do any\nencryption, or anything like that,\n\n550\n00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.720\non the information.\n\n551\n00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.397\nLike Sean was saying earlier,\n\n552\n00:30:44.397 --> 00:30:47.910\nthings like invisible secrets\nallows you to apply a password to,\n\n553\n00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:51.590\nwhich is basically a key for the\nencryption that it's gonna do underneath.\n\n554\n00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:54.640\nSo in this case the text is\nnot actually encrypted, but\n\n555\n00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.570\nif you didn't know it was\nthere that's just a picture.\n\n556\n00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.380\nOops, and I keep opening that\nup with Notepad, I apologize.\n\n557\n00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.040\nYou know, it's just an image.\n\n558\n00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.110\nYou would not know that there was\nanything hidden inside there.\n\n559\n00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:09.650\nOnly if you knew to look would you use\nthe right program to open it up, and\n\n560\n00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.270\nyou could find that hidden image.\n\n561\n00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.280\nAll right?\n\n562\n00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.200\nSo there's a quick example.\n\n563\n00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.696\nAnd that's not the only place,\n\n564\n00:31:16.696 --> 00:31:19.700\nwe can talk about some other\nplaces that steganography is used.\n\n565\n00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.350\nDRM would be one example, right?\n\n566\n00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.840\n>> Yeah,\nit's very popular in those circles.\n\n567\n00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.990\nWhen you look at a DRM they can,\nbecause you can do that.\n\n568\n00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.280\nDigital rights management\nis what it stands for,\n\n569\n00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.960\nin case you hadn't heard the term before.\n\n570\n00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.602\nThey can use it to embed\nownership information\n\n571\n00:31:37.602 --> 00:31:41.150\ninto an image or video or audio.\n\n572\n00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:44.610\nBecause it doesn't just have to be an\nimage, they can embed it into anything and\n\n573\n00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:48.890\nthat way if something happens\nto that image they can find out\n\n574\n00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:52.830\nwho the owner of it originally was.\n\n575\n00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:57.221\nOr they can prove ownership if, I think\nyou have my stuff I can go and look and\n\n576\n00:31:57.221 --> 00:32:01.990\nsay yeah, there's the stuff I embedded\nright into it so it's definitely mine.\n\n577\n00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:07.091\nSo it's very popular in those circles.\n\n578\n00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:11.558\nBut the thing is that those movies,\njust like we saw here, on those movies and\n\n579\n00:32:11.558 --> 00:32:14.871\naudio They put it in there so\nthey could prove ownership.\n\n580\n00:32:14.871 --> 00:32:20.890\nBut it does impact the experience\nof using whatever that content is.\n\n581\n00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:23.790\nIt still plays the same and\nlooks the same as it always would have.\n\n582\n00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.270\n>> Exactly, you'd never know it was there.\n\n583\n00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.150\n>> If you didn't know.\n\n584\n00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:27.650\n>> Exactly.\n\n585\n00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.670\n>> Printed documents as well, we've\ntalked about a couple examples of that,\n\n586\n00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:37.140\nwhere you might have a document that's\nprinting that has information on it, but\n\n587\n00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.013\nthere's secret information\nhidden inside there.\n\n588\n00:32:39.013 --> 00:32:45.850\n>> Like our Dickinson that I cannot\nshare the link with for any reason.\n\n589\n00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:46.550\nCurrency.\n\n590\n00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.230\nThere's another one.\n\n591\n00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:50.040\nWhat are we talking about\nwhen we say currency?\n\n592\n00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.790\n>> Actually, just for a moment here let me\nadd on to the printed documents one a bit.\n\n593\n00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:58.600\nThe printed documents\n>> I know that probably a lot\n\n594\n00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.670\nof us have heard it in passing, but\nyou don't have to deal with it.\n\n595\n00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.370\nOr you don't have to think about it.\n\n596\n00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:10.350\nBut if you look at stuff like the\ndocuments here, these are printed what,\n\n597\n00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.945\na laser printer?\n\n598\n00:33:10.945 --> 00:33:13.170\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I don't know how many of you know,\n\n599\n00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.970\nbut all the documents printed off laser\nprinters, there's dots all over them.\n\n600\n00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.120\nIf you hold a bright light up to them,\n\n601\n00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.120\nthey can trace that right back\nto the printer it was used on.\n\n602\n00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.310\n>> Yeah, they started doing that so\nthey could actually do that,\n\n603\n00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:27.860\ntrace it back to the original printer for\nransom notes and things like that.\n\n604\n00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.640\n>> Yeah, and counterfeiting,\nstuff like that, yeah.\n\n605\n00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.980\nThey did it for a number of reasons.\n\n606\n00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.970\nAnd so they can track it\nright back to where it is.\n\n607\n00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:40.410\nSo yes, those dots are on there,\nobviously we can't see them.\n\n608\n00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:43.770\nAnd that's not, the intention is for\nus to see them.\n\n609\n00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:48.950\nBut they're built into you know just\nabout every model printer out there,\n\n610\n00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:53.410\nas far as I know all the major\nlaser ones have it in there.\n\n611\n00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.710\nI guess unless you're overseas or\nsomething, and they're only for\n\n612\n00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:56.940\nthat market.\n\n613\n00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.790\nI don't know about their requirements, but\n\n614\n00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:02.460\nI know here it's something that\nthe printer companies have voluntarily\n\n615\n00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:07.460\nworked with the law\nenforcement to do that.\n\n616\n00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.820\n>> And then with our currency we've got\nsome hidden messages in there as well?\n\n617\n00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.860\n>> Yeah.\nThe currency,\n\n618\n00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:17.195\njust about every piece of currency out\nthere around the world has some sort of\n\n619\n00:34:17.195 --> 00:34:19.840\nanti-counterfeiting measures in it.\n\n620\n00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.840\nSome of them we know about,\nsome of them we don't.\n\n621\n00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:26.060\nAnd these anti-counterfeiting measures\nare for just that, to keep people from\n\n622\n00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:33.195\ncounterfeiting that particular\ndollar bill or whatever it it is.\n\n623\n00:34:33.195 --> 00:34:34.865\nI printed up a whole bunch of $100 bills.\n\n624\n00:34:34.865 --> 00:34:35.865\nCouldn't use them anywhere.\n\n625\n00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:37.405\n>> Yeah.\nIt's tough.\n\n626\n00:34:37.405 --> 00:34:38.023\n>> I'm kidding, FBI.\n\n627\n00:34:38.023 --> 00:34:39.049\nI'm kidding.\n\n628\n00:34:39.049 --> 00:34:40.625\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm kidding.\n\n629\n00:34:40.625 --> 00:34:44.349\n>> You wonder why you can't [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Right.\n\n630\n00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:50.095\n>> I've got up on my screen here,\nI've got a picture of a closeup\n\n631\n00:34:50.095 --> 00:34:55.700\nof part of a bill here in U.S. currency\n>> And\n\n632\n00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:00.050\nthose ones on the new bills,\none thing you see is if you zoom up\n\n633\n00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:04.920\nreally close on those numbers you can see\nit's printed USA, USA, USA all over it.\n\n634\n00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.470\n>> And that's what was missing on mine and\nthey were able to detect.\n\n635\n00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:08.155\n>> Exactly.\n\n636\n00:35:08.155 --> 00:35:11.170\n[LAUGH] There's other things they do.\n\n637\n00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:14.630\nI think they have, this is an image of it.\n\n638\n00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:20.160\nThat's the same text on the same bill.\n\n639\n00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.990\nBut what they've done here\nis they've made it so\n\n640\n00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:28.220\nthe new bills you have to pan an angle you\nview it at, it actually changes color.\n\n641\n00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.930\nAnd that's very hard to replicate.\n\n642\n00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.855\nAnd there's a whole host of other,\nyou know,\n\n643\n00:35:34.855 --> 00:35:38.640\nanti-counterfeiting things all\nover the place on this bill.\n\n644\n00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.600\nAnd you just have to look for them.\n\n645\n00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.480\nThey even have a little\nstripe embedded in it, too.\n\n646\n00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.920\n>> Got that strip that runs\ndown the middle of it,\n\n647\n00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.370\nor kinda off to the side there.\n\n648\n00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.750\nAnd you've got that holographic kind\nof thing of the president on the back,\n\n649\n00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.020\nI think, on a couple of them.\n\n650\n00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:56.110\nYeah, those are all things done that come\ntogether, they're very tough to duplicate.\n\n651\n00:35:56.110 --> 00:36:00.950\nIn fact that's the way they want\nthem when they created them.\n\n652\n00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:07.260\nAs they said, any one of these things, you\ncould focus on and probably replicate it.\n\n653\n00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:13.380\nBut together, doing all those things\non one bill Is incredibly tough,\n\n654\n00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.520\nif not impossible.\n\n655\n00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.640\nEverything in the currency we have,\nhas a ton\n\n656\n00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:25.270\nof measures in place to prevent\nthem from being duplicated.\n\n657\n00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:27.920\n>> I think I read somewhere that U.S.\ncurrency is some of the most highly\n\n658\n00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.930\nduplicated or\ncounterfeited money out there.\n\n659\n00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.470\n>> Yeah, it's.\n\n660\n00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:35.540\n>> It's very much duplicated\nno matter where you go.\n\n661\n00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:38.330\nInteresting thing about it is,\n\n662\n00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:42.750\nis what is the most duplicated\ndenomination or counterfeited.\n\n663\n00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:43.610\n>> Is it, what, the 20 or?\n\n664\n00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:44.340\n>> The hundred.\n\n665\n00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:44.920\n>> The hundred?\n\n666\n00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.680\n>> The hundred.\nThe hundred still holds that.\n\n667\n00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.915\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n668\n00:36:49.915 --> 00:36:51.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's when they\n\n669\n00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.920\n>> When they see hundreds in a lot of\n\n670\n00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:59.420\ncases they give it extra scrutiny,\nbecause of that specific situation.\n\n671\n00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.620\n>> I remember back when I was in my\nbartending days, we had a marker\n\n672\n00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:06.400\nthat we would run across all the bills\nto see if they were counterfeit or not.\n\n673\n00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.020\nIt would change colors\nif it was counterfeit.\n\n674\n00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.730\n>> Yeah, is it the ink or\nthe paper that reacts?\n\n675\n00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.250\n>> Something in there reacted differently,\nand so\n\n676\n00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.970\nyou just knew by doing\na quick mark with it.\n\n677\n00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.190\nIt was really easy to do but\neasy to detect.\n\n678\n00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.140\n>> In fact, on this,\n\n679\n00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:26.950\nto kind of address something else\nthat may not be as obvious to it.\n\n680\n00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:30.010\nI don't know if it's\nshowing up on the screen.\n\n681\n00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:30.990\nIt kind of sort of is.\n\n682\n00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:33.390\nI can kind of sort of see it on mine too.\n\n683\n00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.880\nIf you don't focus on the ink, but\n\n684\n00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.090\nyou focus on the actual paper\nthat that stuff's printed on.\n\n685\n00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:44.170\nYou can see like on the top one, you can\nsee between the two black zeroes kind of\n\n686\n00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:47.030\nat the bottom, you can see a little\nbit of a scraggly line there.\n\n687\n00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:48.590\n>> Yeah, little thread marks kinda?\n\n688\n00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:53.320\n>> Yeah, that's what they do is\nwhen they create these bills.\n\n689\n00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.010\nThere's only one place in the U.S.\n\n690\n00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:58.190\nthat actually creates the paper\nthat bills are printed on.\n\n691\n00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:01.340\nAnd when they create it,\nas part of the process,\n\n692\n00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:07.350\nthey've got a whole bunch of parts of the\nprocess that are higher than classified.\n\n693\n00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:12.140\nThey don't talk about, but\none of the things they do talk about is\n\n694\n00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:16.190\nthat they have this cloth,\nthe paper that's actually cloth.\n\n695\n00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:17.090\nIt's not really paper.\n\n696\n00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:20.780\n>> Right.\n>> But they also throw in some red and\n\n697\n00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:25.610\nblue fibers in when the paper is made and\nconstructed, and that gets mixed in.\n\n698\n00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:28.300\nYou get these patterns of\nthose things in there.\n\n699\n00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.890\nAnd there's just random patterns,\nbut it's another thing,\n\n700\n00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:35.590\ncuz of the way they're embedded\nin there also makes it unique.\n\n701\n00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:40.000\nSo there's a whole host of\nanti-counterfeiting things.\n\n702\n00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.400\nAnd if you get a magnifying glass out and\n\n703\n00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.220\nexamine any one of the current\nversions of the bills.\n\n704\n00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.790\nYou'll see a lot of these,\nthe older ones had it on there too.\n\n705\n00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:52.480\nOlder ones, you can look it,\n\n706\n00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.060\nwas it the fives got\nthe Lincoln Memorial on the back of it?\n\n707\n00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.220\nI think, if you look at the back\nof a five and you look between\n\n708\n00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:06.730\njust above the pillar,\nbetween the little dots in there,\n\n709\n00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:09.810\nyou'll see the names,\nthe original 13 colonies are in there.\n\n710\n00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:11.150\nSo there's little things like that.\n\n711\n00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:15.530\nBut they've gotten way, way more advanced\nthan that to prevent counterfeiting.\n\n712\n00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:20.928\nSo there's really just prime examples\nof steganography being used Used here,\n\n713\n00:39:20.928 --> 00:39:23.190\nand the U.S. is the only one that does it.\n\n714\n00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:29.430\nOther countries do it too, but there are\nsome good examples posted online on this.\n\n715\n00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.470\nIt's fascinating stuff, it really is.\n\n716\n00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.380\n>> And\nGuido is asking about the file size, and\n\n717\n00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.320\nI'm gonna come back to that Guido,\nI didn't miss your question.\n\n718\n00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:41.150\nI wanna save it for the next segment here,\nwhich is talking about steganalysis and\n\n719\n00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:45.380\nways that we might try to detect\nthat steganography is in use.\n\n720\n00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:47.870\nAnd there's a few different ways\nwe can try to detect that, right?\n\n721\n00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:50.820\nDepending on what method of\nsteganography they're using.\n\n722\n00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:57.840\nYes, steganography, there's so\nmany different ways you can do it.\n\n723\n00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.710\nWe showed the one here with QuickStego\nembedding stuff in an image.\n\n724\n00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:04.011\nThat would definitely be one form.\n\n725\n00:40:04.011 --> 00:40:09.431\nYou see that I had on my\nscreen with a currency.\n\n726\n00:40:09.431 --> 00:40:11.831\nAnd we saw some other photos I showed.\n\n727\n00:40:11.831 --> 00:40:15.591\nBut there's ways to detect\ndifferent forms of steganography.\n\n728\n00:40:15.591 --> 00:40:19.700\nThe ones we want to look at, since\nwe're gonna focus on the digital side,\n\n729\n00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.700\nare those digital assets.\n\n730\n00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:28.610\nAnd so to detect stuff, and those items,\nthere's we've got some tools.\n\n731\n00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:33.610\nIt's not like those things are gonna\nslip by, completely undetected and\n\n732\n00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:35.410\nwe're not gonna be the wiser.\n\n733\n00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:37.570\nThere are ways we can do that.\n\n734\n00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:41.510\nAnd so this whole area of Steganalysis,\nwe've got several tools.\n\n735\n00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:43.700\nFrequency analysis is one.\n\n736\n00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.740\nAnd frequency analysis,\nwe talked about that yesterday.\n\n737\n00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:47.610\nWe did our code break.\n\n738\n00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:49.260\nWe talked about code breaking.\n\n739\n00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.910\nAnd it's really the same\ntype of thing here.\n\n740\n00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:55.100\nIs that under certain conditions,\nyou can see patterns.\n\n741\n00:40:55.100 --> 00:41:01.960\nYou can start seeing patterns\nof colors and bits in there.\n\n742\n00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.210\nAnd those things can reveal that yes,\nthere's something going on in there.\n\n743\n00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:09.280\nWe need to do a closer investigation\non it, we'll draw someone to it.\n\n744\n00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.466\nThen you have histograms,\nwhere you can see the distribution,\n\n745\n00:41:12.466 --> 00:41:16.661\nyou can see certain curve, you can see,\nkinda, analyze the different- [CROSSTALK]\n\n746\n00:41:16.661 --> 00:41:18.636\n>> Colors, [INAUDIBLE] the blacks and\n\n747\n00:41:18.636 --> 00:41:22.050\nthe whites, and the different tones and\nthings like that.\n\n748\n00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:24.630\n>> Yeah, you can look at saturation\nlevels and stuff like that, and\n\n749\n00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:26.285\ntell if it's in there.\n\n750\n00:41:26.285 --> 00:41:29.740\nThen if you're fortunate enough,\nyou can compare it to the original.\n\n751\n00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.580\nSometimes people leave\nthe original behind,\n\n752\n00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.045\nwhich is just flat out\ndumb if you do that.\n\n753\n00:41:34.045 --> 00:41:36.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you've hidden something.\n\n754\n00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.160\nSo, boom.\n\n755\n00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:38.890\nDone.\n\n756\n00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.900\nYou'll notice that a lot of\nthe ones that are meant for\n\n757\n00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:46.380\nprofessional grade, are not proof of\nconcept, they actually include functions\n\n758\n00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:51.860\nthat will delete the original cover text,\nas well as deleting the original payload.\n\n759\n00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.210\nAnd so when the two are merged,\nthose things are gone.\n\n760\n00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:58.800\nSo someone cannot do just a simple file\nrecovery or anything to get those back.\n\n761\n00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.950\nWhich you wouldn't want to do,\nif they could do that then, heck.\n\n762\n00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:07.930\nAnd keep in mind it's not even just\nthem being able to recover the file.\n\n763\n00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:11.140\nIf they know I embedded something in\nthere, and they're able to do like\n\n764\n00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:15.070\nwe talked in the friend's class about file\ncarving, they pull out that little bit.\n\n765\n00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:16.620\nIf they're able to do file carving,\n\n766\n00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:21.530\nthey get enough out of that file carving\nto find what the name of the file is.\n\n767\n00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:27.140\nAnd they could still go target that\nfile and say okay, it's been deleted and\n\n768\n00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:31.758\nI can see there's been a deliberate\nanti-forensics thing done here.\n\n769\n00:42:31.758 --> 00:42:34.380\nNow I'm gonna go to that file and\ndo a steganalysis on it.\n\n770\n00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.670\nThat would be a logic and\nmore advanced thing,\n\n771\n00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:41.250\nbut there's no reason you\ncouldn't do something like that.\n\n772\n00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:42.430\n>> Right.\n\n773\n00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:46.310\n>> And then this last one I\ngot on the list, fingerprints.\n\n774\n00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:51.651\nAnd what I mean by fingerprints is,\nthis tool that Mike uses, this QuickStego,\n\n775\n00:42:51.651 --> 00:42:56.270\none of the ones that I've used\nin the past, Invisible Secrets.\n\n776\n00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:59.780\nAnd there's F5 and a bunch of other ones.\n\n777\n00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.760\nAll of them have unique\nfingerprints that they\n\n778\n00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.960\nleave on a file when they do their job.\n\n779\n00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.400\nAnd so, one of the ways you can also\ndo steganalysis is not just to do that\n\n780\n00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.010\nanalysis on the file to\nsee if those patterns or\n\n781\n00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:15.290\nhistograms, or anything reveal anything.\n\n782\n00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:20.270\nBut is also just to go in and say,\nokay, well, run one of these tools and\n\n783\n00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.170\nanalyze a whole directory or\nfolder of files,\n\n784\n00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:26.110\nand look for anything that's got the\nfingerprints of those tools being used on,\n\n785\n00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:30.870\nand if it does, then it'll be flagged and\nyou can do a closer analysis on it.\n\n786\n00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:34.440\nAnd that's it, so it can-\n>> Kinda give yourself away right there.\n\n787\n00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.650\n>> Yeah.\nSo if you were gonna do something,\n\n788\n00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:41.350\nlike if you really wanted to cover your\ntracks pretty well, you'd have to use\n\n789\n00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:46.600\nsomething that was maybe an underground\ntool, or create a script that did it.\n\n790\n00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:50.190\nOr just flat out create your own\ntool that does that sort of thing.\n\n791\n00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:57.455\nSomething that is not widely used,\nis not widely known, and therefore is\n\n792\n00:43:57.455 --> 00:44:01.670\ngonna avoid being in a signature database\nthat they can easily just fingerprint.\n\n793\n00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:05.268\nThey'll have to go through\nthese much more tedious and\n\n794\n00:44:05.268 --> 00:44:09.970\ntime consuming methods, which heck,\nI'm fine with them doing that.\n\n795\n00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:15.320\nBecause they're gonna carefully choose\ntheir shots and their time, and they may\n\n796\n00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.600\nvery well say that mine doesn't attract\nenough attention, and go someplace else.\n\n797\n00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.710\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n798\n00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.850\nIf we can pull my screen up here for\njust a second,\n\n799\n00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.830\nI'll go back to answer Guido's question.\n\n800\n00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:27.460\nIt kind of fits in with our steganalysis.\n\n801\n00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:31.531\nIf we look at the one on the left, I've\ngot properties for the original image, and\n\n802\n00:44:31.531 --> 00:44:34.311\nI can see that the size was about 24,\n25 kilobytes.\n\n803\n00:44:34.311 --> 00:44:37.162\nOn the right, I've got my hidden,\n\n804\n00:44:37.162 --> 00:44:42.700\nwhich is the image that I created using or\nembedded the data in.\n\n805\n00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:43.970\nAnd the size has grown.\n\n806\n00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:51.890\nIt's up to 246 kilobytes, so it jumped up\n220 something kilobytes there in size.\n\n807\n00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:54.170\n>> Is it the same?\nYou changed file format, though, right?\n\n808\n00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:55.770\n>> And it did change to a BMP, as well.\n\n809\n00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:59.610\nThat particular program doesn't do the\ncompression, so it converts into a BMP.\n\n810\n00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:03.210\nWhich could also have something to\ndo with the file size, as well.\n\n811\n00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:07.120\nBut this is an example of where,\nif you have that original, and\n\n812\n00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.550\nI can compare the two.\n\n813\n00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.740\nIt is gonna be relatively easy,\n\n814\n00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.420\ndepending on how far they've gone with it,\nto detect it.\n\n815\n00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.800\nIt also gives you an idea\nthat the size matters, right.\n\n816\n00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.197\nIf I've got a lot of data to embed,\n\n817\n00:45:21.197 --> 00:45:25.012\nI don't wanna start with\na simple 25 kilobyte file.\n\n818\n00:45:25.012 --> 00:45:31.812\nBecause if I'm gonna dump in 500 megs of\ndata in there, it's gonna be too obvious.\n\n819\n00:45:31.812 --> 00:45:34.410\nThey're gonna be,\nwhy is this picture so large?\n\n820\n00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.590\nIt shouldn't be anywhere near this size.\n\n821\n00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:39.310\nSo I might want to start\nwith a bigger image, right.\n\n822\n00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:41.020\nMore pixels in there.\n\n823\n00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:45.310\nOr maybe I move to a video,\nor to a mp3 file.\n\n824\n00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:48.630\nOr something like that, where that\nsize is not gonna be so obvious.\n\n825\n00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:52.070\nIf I start with a file\nthat's 500 megabytes,\n\n826\n00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:56.520\nand I dump in a few more megabytes\nin there, not gonna be so obvious.\n\n827\n00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.890\nIf I start with a file\nthat's 24 kilobytes, and\n\n828\n00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:02.890\nI dump a few megabytes of data in there,\nit's gonna be rather obvious.\n\n829\n00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:05.060\nOne of the ways we talked\nabout comparisons,\n\n830\n00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:09.675\nyou know one of the ways we can detect,\nand using this steganalysis.\n\n831\n00:46:09.675 --> 00:46:17.680\n>> See the reason I was pointing that out,\nthat it converted from a JPG to a BMP.\n\n832\n00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.320\nIt's just so you recognize that.\n\n833\n00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.620\nOne of the things, this is kinda\nmy guidance on steganography if\n\n834\n00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.960\nyou're gonna embed\nsomething inside an image.\n\n835\n00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:33.104\nIs ask yourself after you've bed whatever\ninside your cover text, would the size of\n\n836\n00:46:33.104 --> 00:46:38.400\nthat make sense to the casual observer, or\neven someone that has a little experience.\n\n837\n00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:43.433\nIf I looked at that as being a JPEG\nthat had grown to that size,\n\n838\n00:46:43.433 --> 00:46:48.861\nit might raise some red flags, but\nas soon as I see it's a bitmap,\n\n839\n00:46:48.861 --> 00:46:53.340\nwe know this thing is just\nblowing really quickly so.\n\n840\n00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:54.160\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n841\n00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:58.930\n>> Well something like that has\na reasonable amount of detail,\n\n842\n00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:00.200\nit's not even that detailed.\n\n843\n00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.992\nBitmaps go [SOUND] really quickly so.\n\n844\n00:47:03.992 --> 00:47:08.107\nThat would be reasonable to kind of think,\nit's a normal BNP.\n\n845\n00:47:08.107 --> 00:47:12.607\nBut if I went on that JPEG and\nthat JPEG all of a sudden,\n\n846\n00:47:12.607 --> 00:47:18.707\nit really is a simple image, that cover\nof that book is not that complex,\n\n847\n00:47:18.707 --> 00:47:22.726\nand that thing was like 30 megs or\nsomething.\n\n848\n00:47:22.726 --> 00:47:23.402\n>> Right.\n\n849\n00:47:23.402 --> 00:47:25.900\n>> No.\n>> Somethings wrong.\n\n850\n00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.350\n>> There's something just not right.\n\n851\n00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:30.220\nI don't know,\nmaybe they could have gone through and\n\n852\n00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.850\nedited it in Photoshop or something.\n\n853\n00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:35.365\nCarried a bunch of extra metadata and\nall, that's possible.\n\n854\n00:47:35.365 --> 00:47:39.760\nBut I'd want to investigate to find\nout if it's something like that.\n\n855\n00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.780\nOr if it is something where\nsomeone's trying to hide.\n\n856\n00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:42.690\n>> Yeah.\n\n857\n00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:44.180\n>> Something inside that file.\n\n858\n00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:47.010\n>> Also have to worry about some\nof the file types that you use.\n\n859\n00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.100\nIf they're, like,\na JPEG is a compression, right?\n\n860\n00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:50.620\nWhat is it?\n\n861\n00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.370\nI forget the full name of that.\n\n862\n00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:54.781\nIt's a Lossy format, right?\n\n863\n00:47:54.781 --> 00:47:57.461\nIt's gonna throw away some things\nas it does that compression.\n\n864\n00:47:57.461 --> 00:48:01.267\nIf we're hiding data in there, and we're\nre-encoding it, we do have to be careful,\n\n865\n00:48:01.267 --> 00:48:04.605\nbecause we could end up Dropping some of\nthe bits that we were trying to hide in\n\n866\n00:48:04.605 --> 00:48:08.255\nthere, so you do have to worry about some\nof the formats that you choose when you're\n\n867\n00:48:08.255 --> 00:48:10.060\ndoing steganography as well.\n\n868\n00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:15.030\nAnd to answer a question in there, why is\nmy computer opening up BMPs with Notepad?\n\n869\n00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:19.110\nBecause in a previous show, we were\nworking with that, I wanted to see, or\n\n870\n00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:21.620\nwe're looking for\nthe headers in the BMP image.\n\n871\n00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:22.600\n>> Yeah, the forensics.\n\n872\n00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.360\n>> Yeah,\nwhen we were doing a forensics episode.\n\n873\n00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.800\nIf you haven't checked those\nepisodes out make sure you do.\n\n874\n00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.470\nAnd that's why I changed that just\ntemporarily and forgot to change it back.\n\n875\n00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:33.660\nSo no BMPs are not normally\nopened up with Notepad.\n\n876\n00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:37.170\nAll right, well Sean,\na lot of great information there.\n\n877\n00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.680\nWe talked about steganography,\nwhere it came from,\n\n878\n00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:44.160\nwhy we'd wanna use it, some great\nexamples of where it's used every day.\n\n879\n00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.970\nDRM, printed documents, currency.\n\n880\n00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:52.380\nSome examples of where we've seen it\nin the past, as well as ways we can do\n\n881\n00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:56.940\nsteg analysis, how we can try to detect\nthat steganography has been used.\n\n882\n00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:01.200\nSo, anything else we wanna throw in\nhere before we wrap this one up?\n\n883\n00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:05.810\n>> Can't really say too more much\nabout the process itself, but\n\n884\n00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:12.870\nremember those that were with us for\nthe CEH and the DFI course,\n\n885\n00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:18.250\nthose two both talked about using\nsteganography in different ways.\n\n886\n00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.630\nThis is just to look at the process.\n\n887\n00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:26.570\nBut if you look at those two, we saw\nways in the CEH of using it to hide and\n\n888\n00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:29.160\ncover our tracks, which this is ideal for.\n\n889\n00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:34.170\nAnd then, in the forensic investigator,\nwe saw it as something that we need to\n\n890\n00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:39.260\nbe aware of the steganalysis side, because\npeople are becoming more familiar with\n\n891\n00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:43.250\nthis, and so they could very easily hide\nstuff in such a way that we can't find it.\n\n892\n00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:44.240\nAnd that can include anything.\n\n893\n00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.548\nThat includes stuff like this,\ninclude malware.\n\n894\n00:49:46.548 --> 00:49:49.330\nThat's been done.\n\n895\n00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:53.390\nSo, we have to be aware of\na technique like this so\n\n896\n00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:57.010\nthat's other things to be thinking about,\nit does show up in other areas.\n\n897\n00:49:57.010 -->

00:00:38.130\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.149\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.350\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.750\n>> I am doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n7\n00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.260\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.678\nWe're doing another episode in\nour cryptography series, and\n\n9\n00:00:48.678 --> 00:00:52.041\nin this one we wanna take a look\nat the future of cryptography.\n\n10\n00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:56.115\nThese last few episodes, we've gone over\nmany different aspects of cryptography.\n\n11\n00:00:56.115 --> 00:01:00.390\nAnd we wanna kind of take a look\nat where things are heading.\n\n12\n00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.443\nBecause as we've talked about\nSean in our previous episodes,\n\n13\n00:01:03.443 --> 00:01:05.870\nit's all about trying to\nstay ahead of the curve.\n\n14\n00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.042\nWith cryptography, as computers\nbecome more and more powerful,\n\n15\n00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:12.780\nsome of these weaker algorithms.\n\n16\n00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.010\nShorter keys become easier and\neasier to break, so\n\n17\n00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.270\nwe're constantly trying to keep ahead of\nthat curve if you will, technology wise.\n\n18\n00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.730\nSo let's talk about where we\nthink things might be headed.\n\n19\n00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.846\n>> There's a lot of exciting things\nthat are happening with cryptography.\n\n20\n00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:35.886\nFirst of all, talk about future\napplications of it that we expect to see.\n\n21\n00:01:35.886 --> 00:01:41.208\nExpect to see, not only stronger\nalgorithms and more robust algorithms,\n\n22\n00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:46.191\nbut also expect to see it pop up in\nmore places because of the exchange of\n\n23\n00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:52.800\ninformation and more places that we're\nseeing sensitive information being stored.\n\n24\n00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.800\nYou're gonna see cryptography just pop up\nand encryption techniques appear in so\n\n25\n00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.086\nmany different places then they were or\nmay not have ever been before.\n\n26\n00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:06.995\nIn fact, when you start thinking about\nthe some of the recent, when I say recent,\n\n27\n00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:11.480\nI mean maybe over the last five years,\njust over that time period, would be\n\n28\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.393\ncertainly a high profile events where\npeople are concerned about their privacy,\n\n29\n00:02:16.393 --> 00:02:21.121\nand they're worried about the government's\nwatching what they're doing.\n\n30\n00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:25.592\nAnd then you just add on top of that with\nmore mobile devices that people worry what\n\n31\n00:02:25.592 --> 00:02:29.343\nhappen if they get lost,\nthey're realizing that cryptography and\n\n32\n00:02:29.343 --> 00:02:33.064\nencryption techniques are something\nthat they just need to have.\n\n33\n00:02:33.064 --> 00:02:37.393\nAnd so you're seeing this whole evolution\nof it where it's becoming more and\n\n34\n00:02:37.393 --> 00:02:38.400\nmore important.\n\n35\n00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.540\nIt's something that, it's not just\na few of us talking about it anymore,\n\n36\n00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.220\nit's something where just your\ncasual user is talking about.\n\n37\n00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.967\nThey see the features on their phone for\nexample, to encrypt it so\n\n38\n00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:53.729\nno one else can get into it-\n>> Right.\n\n39\n00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:58.318\n>> Except them, you're seeing criminals\nknowing about encrypting whole hard\n\n40\n00:02:58.318 --> 00:03:02.540\ndrives as something to protect and\ncover up what they're doing.\n\n41\n00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.800\nSo you're seeing more and more of that.\n\n42\n00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.373\nAnd that's also testing the law.\n\n43\n00:03:07.373 --> 00:03:12.054\nSo the law is gonna have to evolve\nto counter some of the stuff that's\n\n44\n00:03:12.054 --> 00:03:15.290\nhappening in the cryptographic field.\n\n45\n00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.250\nWe had talked along the way about\none of the issues, I believe we\n\n46\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.950\nbrought this up in the forensics course\nwhere if you have a password for\n\n47\n00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.450\nyour system,\nif it's written down versus in your head,\n\n48\n00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.110\nis it something that you are gonna\nbe compelled to give up or not?\n\n49\n00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.450\n>> Right, in a court of law maybe.\n\n50\n00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.757\nWhether I'm required to\ndivulge that information.\n\n51\n00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:41.486\n>> Yeah, and\nthe reason why I bring that up in that\n\n52\n00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:46.825\nspecific situation is they\nhad a case where there was\n\n53\n00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:52.186\na lady in Colorado that had\nencrypted her notebook.\n\n54\n00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:56.452\nThis was something that she was\nconducting a legal activity and\n\n55\n00:03:56.452 --> 00:03:58.070\nknew enough to do that.\n\n56\n00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.090\nSo if it fell into the wrong hands they\ncouldn't get access to her information.\n\n57\n00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.870\nWell, she was being investigated and\nwas under surveillance.\n\n58\n00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.246\nAnd so they grab the notebook, and\nwhen they found it was encrypted,\n\n59\n00:04:11.246 --> 00:04:15.321\nknowing they couldn't break it\nin a reasonable amount of time,\n\n60\n00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:18.120\nthey compelled her to\ngive up the password.\n\n61\n00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.740\nAnd there was a big battle over whether or\nnot she should give up that password.\n\n62\n00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.437\nBecause is she exercising her fifth\namendment rights not to incriminate\n\n63\n00:04:27.437 --> 00:04:32.519\nherself or should she have to give it up\nbecause it's part of a search warrant,\n\n64\n00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:33.993\npart of a legal thing?\n\n65\n00:04:33.993 --> 00:04:38.117\nAnd so there was a big battle with that\nbecause it just really hadn't been\n\n66\n00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:42.174\nencountered in that way before,\nbecause it was not only something that\n\n67\n00:04:42.174 --> 00:04:45.826\nwasn't seen a ton, it just the law\nhadn't really accounted for\n\n68\n00:04:45.826 --> 00:04:48.282\nit since it hadn't been seen a ton before.\n\n69\n00:04:48.282 --> 00:04:53.550\n>> Right, when they wrote the laws they\ntalk about incriminating yourself.\n\n70\n00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.351\nThis wasn't even\na possibility at that point.\n\n71\n00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:59.600\nBut now it is, and so\neverything has to be adjusted.\n\n72\n00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.660\nWe also saw an example of\ntechnology getting better and\n\n73\n00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.510\nbetter throughout our episodes, as well.\n\n74\n00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.880\nWe take asymmetric encryption.\n\n75\n00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.020\nThey knew about asymmetric or\n\n76\n00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.300\nthey had theorized that we could\ndo this asymmetric encryption.\n\n77\n00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.691\nEarly on, I think you mentioned in the 70s\nor something, there were papers written.\n\n78\n00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:19.870\nBut we couldn't implement it because\ncomputers weren't powerful enough.\n\n79\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.950\nSome computers could, but not your\neveryday computer or anything like that,\n\n80\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.800\nit couldn't handle that type of math that\nwas involved with those prime numbers.\n\n81\n00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.900\nAnd now we can, and now we see asymmetric\nencryption on little tiny devices.\n\n82\n00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.660\nSo just an example of where\nas technology increases or\n\n83\n00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.270\nimproves, the encryption\ncan improve along with it.\n\n84\n00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.120\nBut also the other side is the code\nanalysis or the breaking or\n\n85\n00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.700\nthe decryption gets more powerful as well.\n\n86\n00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.650\n>> Yeah, that's the side that\nwe always have to think about,\n\n87\n00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.055\nsomething that we didn't\nbring up in this course.\n\n88\n00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.540\nIf you have the book you\ncan see it in there.\n\n89\n00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.960\nI didn't bring it up cuz it wasn't\nsignificant enough to bring up with what\n\n90\n00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.370\nwe were talking about, but we talked a\nlittle bit about the keys getting longer.\n\n91\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.370\nWhat the implication of that is as far\nas how many keys you have available,\n\n92\n00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.120\nand the fact that it doesn't\nmake the key space bigger.\n\n93\n00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.370\nWell that's very, very important,\n\n94\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.210\nbecause when you start adding on\nthose bits there's a point where\n\n95\n00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.360\neven supercomputers are not gonna offer\nyou really that much of advantage.\n\n96\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.580\nYou get up to the really,\nreally high number keys like 128-bit,\n\n97\n00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.420\nthe difference between\na computer that we have here and\n\n98\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:44.670\na supercomputer that the government might\nhave and time is if I used this one,\n\n99\n00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.660\nit's like 10 to the 19th power\nyears it would take to break this.\n\n100\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.746\nIf the government had its\n\n101\n00:06:50.746 --> 00:06:52.369\n10 to the 18th power-\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n102\n00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:55.522\n>> 17th power-\n>> We're talking about a decreasing it\n\n103\n00:06:55.522 --> 00:06:57.941\nfrom a billion years to a million years.\n\n104\n00:06:57.941 --> 00:07:02.777\nThose aren't exact numbers, but\njust to kind of grasp that concept.\n\n105\n00:07:02.777 --> 00:07:06.713\nSo yeah [CROSSTALK] but the supercomputer\nis gonna reduce the amount of time\n\n106\n00:07:06.713 --> 00:07:08.850\nthat it takes to crack that key.\n\n107\n00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.042\nBut still not feasible, not within\nmy lifetime or my kid's lifetime, so\n\n108\n00:07:13.042 --> 00:07:15.010\nit really doesn't do me any good.\n\n109\n00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.385\n>> That's the thing with it, is with the\nstuff we have now, if you're just gonna\n\n110\n00:07:20.385 --> 00:07:24.411\nuse a brute force with it, with a super\ncomputer, it's not gonna help you.\n\n111\n00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:29.033\nYou'd have to find a flaw or do one of\nthe techniques that we were talking\n\n112\n00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:34.250\nabout to give you more insight,\nto be able to cut that down substantially.\n\n113\n00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:41.110\nAnd so that's where a lot of the work\nof crypt analysis concentrate on.\n\n114\n00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.848\nRemember, we talked about code breaking,\none of the things I kind of just threw out\n\n115\n00:07:45.848 --> 00:07:50.047\nthere was that they don't consider\nbrute force to be true code breaking,\n\n116\n00:07:50.047 --> 00:07:52.365\nbecause there's no real science to it.\n\n117\n00:07:52.365 --> 00:07:54.797\nYou just throw whatever you have\nat it until something works.\n\n118\n00:07:54.797 --> 00:07:57.303\n>> You're not really breaking the code,\nall you're doing is guessing a whole\n\n119\n00:07:57.303 --> 00:07:59.118\nnumber of times, and\nhopefully you guess correctly.\n\n120\n00:07:59.118 --> 00:08:01.128\nBut if the code is still intact, and\n\n121\n00:08:01.128 --> 00:08:04.750\nif they had something else\nencrypted with that same algorithm.\n\n122\n00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.985\nYou couldn't crack that, you wouldn't\nbe able to just immediately go, oh,\n\n123\n00:08:07.985 --> 00:08:08.825\nI know what that is.\n\n124\n00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:11.715\nYou'd have to start your\nguessing all over again.\n\n125\n00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:14.941\nCuz you didn't break the code at all,\nall you did was get lucky and\n\n126\n00:08:14.941 --> 00:08:15.887\nguess what it was.\n\n127\n00:08:15.887 --> 00:08:18.448\n>> Yeah, that's where it came down to.\n\n128\n00:08:18.448 --> 00:08:21.460\nAnd then, of course,\nwhen the computer power picked up,\n\n129\n00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.517\nthen some of the ones with shorter keys\nbecame within reach within a reasonable\n\n130\n00:08:25.517 --> 00:08:29.395\namount of time depending on what,\nI guess, what reasonable means to you.\n\n131\n00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:30.922\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n132\n00:08:30.922 --> 00:08:34.122\n>> But\nthat's just gonna keep continuing on, and\n\n133\n00:08:34.122 --> 00:08:39.406\nthen you start looking at the technology,\nwhat things are doing on that side.\n\n134\n00:08:39.406 --> 00:08:44.572\nOne of the things that's been a big game\nchanger is, if you look at when they\n\n135\n00:08:44.572 --> 00:08:49.770\nbroke Dez in the early 90s initially,\nit did take a few days to do it.\n\n136\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.630\nAnd they've cut that down because\nthe hardware's picked up.\n\n137\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.740\nBut one of the things that's also sped\nit up is this distributed computing.\n\n138\n00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.190\nDistributed computing, if you can\ntie together all these systems and\n\n139\n00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:07.000\nuse that collective power to go towards\nthe target, then that becomes much, much,\n\n140\n00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.160\nmuch stronger and so, or a much,\nmuch more powerful entity.\n\n141\n00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.890\nAnd that's really been just\na massive game changer.\n\n142\n00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.160\nBecause no one really\nexpected that to happen.\n\n143\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.270\nDistributed computing and\nusing that hive mind type of deal,\n\n144\n00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:25.013\nthat was science fiction is what that\nwas until someone was able to say,\n\n145\n00:09:25.013 --> 00:09:27.562\nhey, I wonder if I could really do it.\n\n146\n00:09:27.562 --> 00:09:32.640\nAnd they did it, and\nthen you see just the sheer power of that.\n\n147\n00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.200\nAnd we've seen projects like\na study at home project.\n\n148\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.474\nYou've seen cancer research done on it.\n\n149\n00:09:39.474 --> 00:09:42.459\n>> [CROSSTALK] Mapping DNA,\nmapping genome, yeah.\n\n150\n00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:46.691\n>> Yeah, you see all these things but then\nsomewhere along the way someone said, oh,\n\n151\n00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:49.852\nwell, I bet I could use this for\ncode breaking and doing that.\n\n152\n00:09:49.852 --> 00:09:52.870\nAnd they did it and it has worked.\n\n153\n00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:57.280\nThe thing that causes an issue with it\nis the security, you never know who's\n\n154\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.760\ngoing to participate in that if you\njust open it up to the Internet.\n\n155\n00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:05.120\nAnd then the other thing is you still have\nto refine the code breaking technique.\n\n156\n00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.720\nSo those are barriers, but who knows?\n\n157\n00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.360\nBut they're also working on other\nthings to even counter that.\n\n158\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.930\nSo it is very much a cat and\nmouse game, a game of one-upmanship,\n\n159\n00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.760\nwhere they get one side does something,\nthe other side does another, and\n\n160\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.580\nthey just keep going back and\nforth and back and forth.\n\n161\n00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.045\nSo it's gonna be this way,\nprobably forever.\n\n162\n00:10:27.045 --> 00:10:27.772\n>> Forever.\n\n163\n00:10:27.772 --> 00:10:32.011\n>> Forever, until you're like, oh well,\nwe can trust people, so forever.\n\n164\n00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:32.760\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, pretty much.\n\n165\n00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.010\nChris brings up a pretty good point.\n\n166\n00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.220\nI've seen that where a university\ndidn't have the funds for\n\n167\n00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.340\na supercomputer that they wanted to use to\ndo some research with, so they went and\n\n168\n00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.340\nbought a bunch of PS3s and\ntied those together.\n\n169\n00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.690\nExact same concept, right,\nas distributing computing.\n\n170\n00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.650\nYou're spreading that workload\nacross multiple processors\n\n171\n00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.380\nof multiple different systems.\n\n172\n00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.070\nSo now everybody's gonna go out and run\nand buy out all these old PS3s they can\n\n173\n00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.510\nfind, but yep,\nsame kind of concept there, exactly.\n\n174\n00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:04.570\n>> Yeah, they are now even\nusing Raspberry Pis to do that,\n\n175\n00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.280\nto build super computers,\nwhich would be even cheaper.\n\n176\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:07.923\n>> Absolutely.\n>> And\n\n177\n00:11:07.923 --> 00:11:11.846\nthey could just snap on\ncapacity as they see fit.\n\n178\n00:11:11.846 --> 00:11:14.326\nI mean, you can see videos on\nYouTube of them doing that.\n\n179\n00:11:14.326 --> 00:11:19.329\nSo it's a good point to bring up\nsomething like these PS3s and to bring up\n\n180\n00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:24.170\nstuff like a Raspberry Pi because it\nshows you what used to be something\n\n181\n00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:29.199\nthat you really kind of had to know\nall the intimate details and all that.\n\n182\n00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:33.890\nNow they've brought it down to a level\nwhere you don't need that anymore.\n\n183\n00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.390\nYou can, you still need\na considerable amount of knowledge.\n\n184\n00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.240\nIt's not like anyone of us can just\ngo grab a system and say, okay,\n\n185\n00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.340\nbreak that code.\n\n186\n00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.490\nNo, there's optimizations and\nstuff like that that has to be done.\n\n187\n00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.460\nAnd you have to plan a strategy.\n\n188\n00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.206\nBut it's becoming more and\nmore and more in reach to do that.\n\n189\n00:11:52.206 --> 00:11:58.678\nI mean, the fact that you can get a $35\nlittle box which the Raspberry Pi costs\n\n190\n00:11:58.678 --> 00:12:05.065\nand drop some software on it which is\nmade available and make a super computer.\n\n191\n00:12:05.065 --> 00:12:08.487\nTell someone that 15 years ago,\n10 years ago,\n\n192\n00:12:08.487 --> 00:12:12.860\nthat you could do that and\nthey'd be, no, you're not.\n\n193\n00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.850\nSuper computer, you needed a freaking\nroom to build those things in, right?\n\n194\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:24.050\n>> Yeah, with all the liquid nitrogen, all\nthat stuff coming in, no, no, that's done.\n\n195\n00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.460\nYou don't need to do that.\n\n196\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.754\n>> In my spare bedroom I got a stack of\nRasp Pis and I got my own super computer.\n\n197\n00:12:28.754 --> 00:12:31.415\nSo now, do you wanna play a game?\n\n198\n00:12:31.415 --> 00:12:33.306\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've built the whopper right\n\n199\n00:12:33.306 --> 00:12:33.828\nin my house.\n\n200\n00:12:33.828 --> 00:12:36.669\n[LAUGH] All right, so as we said,\n\n201\n00:12:36.669 --> 00:12:41.947\ncryptography is one of those\nthings that's not stagnant.\n\n202\n00:12:41.947 --> 00:12:43.080\nIt's always changing.\n\n203\n00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.424\nWe've talked about it just through\nour episodes, how we progressed from\n\n204\n00:12:47.424 --> 00:12:51.650\nthe early, heck, we started back in\nwith the ancient Egyptians, right, and\n\n205\n00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.580\nwe've worked our way\nthrough to modern times.\n\n206\n00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.150\nAnd we've seen that steady progression and\nthat's not gonna change.\n\n207\n00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:03.690\nIt's gonna continue to progress throughout\nour lifetimes and into the future.\n\n208\n00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:08.550\nSo, faster computers,\nbetter processors, tying more computers\n\n209\n00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:13.770\ntogether is all gonna aid in the ability\nto try and break some of these codes,\n\n210\n00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.350\nbut then again, at the same time,\nthe codes are getting better.\n\n211\n00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.400\nThe formulas, the algorithms, the ciphers\nthat they're using are becoming more and\n\n212\n00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.525\nmore complex,\n\n213\n00:13:22.525 --> 00:13:26.830\nbecause we have the processing power to\nactually manipulate those bigger numbers.\n\n214\n00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.230\nWe got longer keys because, again,\nwe've got that processing power.\n\n215\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.922\nAs the processing power increases,\nit helps both sides, right?\n\n216\n00:13:34.922 --> 00:13:39.550\nIt helps people create stronger algorithms\nand longer keys, to use longer keys.\n\n217\n00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.750\nIt also helps people that want\nto break those codes as well.\n\n218\n00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.340\n>> The other thing you're\ngonna be looking for\n\n219\n00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.980\ndown the road is you're gonna\nbe looking for technologies and\n\n220\n00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:55.032\ntechniques that solve some of the age-old\nproblems that we have with cryptography.\n\n221\n00:13:55.032 --> 00:13:58.710\nWe still have to worry\nabout key exchange issues.\n\n222\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:05.390\nSo we've got a public and private key,\nwhich does solve a lot of those, but\n\n223\n00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.440\nyou could still make a case that there are\nstill some things that need to be done,\n\n224\n00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.620\nin the form of PKI and stuff like that.\n\n225\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.850\nThere's still some overhead there.\n\n226\n00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.720\nOkay, we deal with that,\nwe're fine with that, but\n\n227\n00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.390\nthey're finding ways to address that.\n\n228\n00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.140\nThe other thing of course being the speed.\n\n229\n00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.830\nThey want the encryption\nto be done a lot faster.\n\n230\n00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.720\nWe don't worry about it with the stuff\nwe do here that we practice and\n\n231\n00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.370\ntry it out because we're not doing a lot.\n\n232\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.830\nBut if I tell you, hey,\n\n233\n00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:34.860\ngo encrypt a hard drive, just a terabyte\nhard drive, that takes a while.\n\n234\n00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.470\nSo they're doing things\nto make that faster.\n\n235\n00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.010\nAnd then you've got other problems,\nlike eavesdropping.\n\n236\n00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:45.721\nJust plain and\nsimple eavesdropping becomes a big, big,\n\n237\n00:14:45.721 --> 00:14:48.711\nbig problem with the cryptography.\n\n238\n00:14:48.711 --> 00:14:52.180\nAnd they're looking at more\nefficient ways to solve that.\n\n239\n00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.780\nAnd they're really pushing a long\nway towards solving those problems.\n\n240\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.350\nSome of those things are still\non the drawing board or\n\n241\n00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.610\njust coming into fruition.\n\n242\n00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:07.090\nBut you're almost at this point where\nnot only you're on this age of computers\n\n243\n00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.947\nshifting to something different and\n\n244\n00:15:09.947 --> 00:15:13.480\nmetamorphosizing into a whole\ndifferent type of entity.\n\n245\n00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.960\nBut also other technologies,\nsuch as cryptography, changing with it.\n\n246\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.870\nBecause that's one of the things\nthat would be a very big deal with\n\n247\n00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.420\nsome of the computing technologies\nthey're talking about.\n\n248\n00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.990\nIf those were to come live, or\nI should say when they come live,\n\n249\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.270\nthey will be coming live.\n\n250\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.700\nAs soon as those become,\n\n251\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.640\nlive the whole world of\ncryptography will change overnight.\n\n252\n00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.150\nThere's a couple big\ndevelopments out there.\n\n253\n00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.851\nOne that we're gonna talk about,\nas a matter of fact,\n\n254\n00:15:39.851 --> 00:15:43.513\nthere's a big development out there\nthat will change the whole picture.\n\n255\n00:15:43.513 --> 00:15:48.760\nAnything that you've done in cryptography\nso far will basically be worthless.\n\n256\n00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.240\nIt'll be like putting a piece of\nScotch tape to lock your door.\n\n257\n00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.530\nThat's about it.\n\n258\n00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:54.375\n>> Yeah.\n\n259\n00:15:54.375 --> 00:15:58.203\nBut as you mentioned, asymmetric\nencryption really is a more advanced\n\n260\n00:15:58.203 --> 00:16:01.835\nform of encryption, but one of the big\nthings we brought it in was for\n\n261\n00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:06.204\nthat key distribution, right, to hide\n'Cuz we still wanna use the symmetric.\n\n262\n00:16:06.204 --> 00:16:11.570\nThe tried and true, the old simple\nmethod of cryptography or encryption.\n\n263\n00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.240\nWe wanna use that,\n'cuz it is fast, it's lightweight.\n\n264\n00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.890\nBut we talked about that\nproblem of key distribution.\n\n265\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.170\nSo asymmetric encryption, which can\nbe used to encrypt the actual data.\n\n266\n00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.790\nBut it's a lot slower,\nmore processor intensive,\n\n267\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.150\nis really used just to protect\nthat key distribution part.\n\n268\n00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.460\nSo some of the technology\nwe're going to talk about,\n\n269\n00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:36.300\nthat's one of the big things that it's\ngoing to address is that key distribution.\n\n270\n00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:36.820\n>> Yeah.\n\n271\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.680\nThe stuff we're going to\nbe talking about here,\n\n272\n00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.050\nprobably going to get to it in the next\nsegment to give it our full attention.\n\n273\n00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.670\nSo you can give it your\nfull attention too.\n\n274\n00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.730\nIt's definitely a game changer.\n\n275\n00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.873\nIt solves just such\na great amount of things.\n\n276\n00:16:53.873 --> 00:16:54.759\n>> Go ahead.\nYou can say it.\n\n277\n00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:58.500\n[LAUGH]\n>> No, I'm not going to say it.\n\n278\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.296\n>> We're going to leave you\nhanging on the edge of your seat.\n\n279\n00:17:01.296 --> 00:17:02.580\n[LAUGH]\n>> We're going to\n\n280\n00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.970\ntalk about technology addresses\na lot of these things and\n\n281\n00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.940\nis gonna be the next big\nleap in cryptography.\n\n282\n00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:18.631\nIt's mind blowing stuff, but it's stuff\nthat I think you'll find very interesting\n\n283\n00:17:18.631 --> 00:17:23.744\nand exciting, and it's something\nthat you're gonna see down the road.\n\n284\n00:17:23.744 --> 00:17:25.079\nAnd like we said,\n\n285\n00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:30.870\nthe stuff we're talking is still gonna\nwork with the current technologies.\n\n286\n00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.630\nYes, they're gonna have to\nredesign the algorithms.\n\n287\n00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:37.300\nBut it's the stuff we've got talking about\nis still gonna work with all the stuff\n\n288\n00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:37.970\nwe have.\n\n289\n00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:39.970\nThose things, algorithms get stronger.\n\n290\n00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.960\nBut they're gonna start doing stuff about\nthe keys and construction of it, so\n\n291\n00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:50.700\nthat's the next step we got coming up,\nis to talk about what that is.\n\n292\n00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.050\n>> All right.\n\n293\n00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:52.790\nI tell you what, Sean.\n\n294\n00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.730\nIt's getting close to\nour break time anyway.\n\n295\n00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.120\nSo why don't we go ahead and\n\n296\n00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.295\nbreak here, leave you guys\nhanging on the edge of your seat.\n\n297\n00:17:59.295 --> 00:17:59.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n298\n00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:04.200\nwhen we come back, we'll talk about,\nyeah, no I'm not actually gonna say it.\n\n299\n00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna make you wait,\n\n300\n00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.370\nwe're gonna make you come back.\n\n301\n00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.930\nSo we're gonna step away for\na minute, take a quick break,\n\n302\n00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.070\nwhen we come back you're gonna\nlearn what this new technology is.\n\n303\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.850\n>> It's actually encrypted back here.\n\n304\n00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.750\n>> That's right,\nit is behind us right now.\n\n305\n00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.010\n>> If you run this image back here,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n306\n00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.375\n>> this is really a green screen.\n\n307\n00:18:19.375 --> 00:18:24.187\n>> [LAUGH] All right, stay tuned ladies\nand gentlemen, we'll be right back.\n\n308\n00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:26.226\n[MUSIC]\n\n309\n00:18:26.226 --> 00:18:32.710\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n310\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.350\nSo we left you guys on a little\nbit of a cliff hanger.\n\n311\n00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.560\nWe were talking about, you know,\nthe future of cryptography, and\n\n312\n00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.070\nkind of where things were headed.\n\n313\n00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.460\nAnd now we're gonna talk about\na technology that's really not so\n\n314\n00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.800\nmuch the future, right Sean?\n\n315\n00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.320\nIt's pretty much on us now.\n\n316\n00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.450\nIt is new, a lot of you might\nnot be familiar with it, but\n\n317\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.600\nit's actually in use in a couple places.\n\n318\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.270\nAnd it could be the way things hit.\n\n319\n00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:01.400\n>> Yeah, so what we're talking about,\nall the techniques actually are there,\n\n320\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:07.060\nand they are in practice now, it's\nsomething called quantum cryptography.\n\n321\n00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:07.855\n>> Dum dum dum.\n\n322\n00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:08.470\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n323\n00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:09.455\nThat's what it is.\n\n324\n00:19:09.455 --> 00:19:12.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's still a developing area but\n\n325\n00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:17.828\nthis is one of the future\ndevelopments of cryptography.\n\n326\n00:19:17.828 --> 00:19:23.150\nNow, it's got a neat sounding name,\nquantum cryptography.\n\n327\n00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.620\nSo what does that mean?\n\n328\n00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.460\nWell, it's a form of cryptography\nthat relies on a field of science\n\n329\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.630\nknown as quantum mechanics.\n\n330\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.353\nAnd what quantum mechanics are, so\n\n331\n00:19:33.353 --> 00:19:34.901\nyou don't have to Google it and\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n332\n00:19:34.901 --> 00:19:37.916\n>> everything like that, quantum mechanics\n\n333\n00:19:37.916 --> 00:19:44.070\nis an area of physics that deals with the\nstuff on a very, very, very small scale.\n\n334\n00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:51.110\nYou're talking about the size of\na single atom is what we're looking at.\n\n335\n00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.990\nAnd they have a whole area of science\nthat deals specifically with that.\n\n336\n00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.540\nAnd the reason is,\nis the rules we have and\n\n337\n00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:03.550\nthe stuff we know about things\non a macroscopic scale,\n\n338\n00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.750\nalso they may have taught you, if you took\nphysics class in high school or college or\n\n339\n00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.280\nanything like that, the stuff that you\nlearn that takes place on a day to day.\n\n340\n00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.510\nThe stuff that we can see,\nand feel, and touch.\n\n341\n00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.400\nThose things operate one way.\n\n342\n00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.570\nBut once we get very small, all the rules\nthat we have actually go out the window.\n\n343\n00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:27.860\nI mean, some really weird, weird\nstuff happens, and it's really crazy.\n\n344\n00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.740\n>> And yes, James, at the end of\nthis we are going to say, oh boy.\n\n345\n00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.341\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] Yeah, go for it.\n\n346\n00:20:33.341 --> 00:20:35.090\n>> For those of you who are familiar with\n\n347\n00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:36.470\nthe show Quantum Leap\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n348\n00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.070\n>> That was his line that he said every\n\n349\n00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.630\ntime he looked in the mirror and\nsaw who he had formed as.\n\n350\n00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.810\nBut anyway, yeah it's interesting.\n\n351\n00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:48.070\nI took physics way back when in\nhigh school and things like that.\n\n352\n00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.090\nAnd Physics deals with the large objects,\nor\n\n353\n00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:54.900\nat the time we said physics dealt with\neverything, right, the Laws of Physics.\n\n354\n00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.310\n>> But what they found is as we get into\nthese smaller and smaller particles, and\n\n355\n00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.500\nwhen we get down to the atom, and\nwe start breaking that atom into\n\n356\n00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.970\neven smaller pieces,\nthe laws of physics don't seem to apply.\n\n357\n00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:10.550\nAnd so they've come up with a new set\nof rules that applies to these very,\n\n358\n00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:15.180\nvery tiny objects, and that's quantum\nphysics or quantum mechanics.\n\n359\n00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:20.590\n>> It's a crazy area and one of\nthe really weird things about it is,\n\n360\n00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.100\nwell, there's many weird things about it.\n\n361\n00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:22.921\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:21:22.921 --> 00:21:24.197\n>> As you're gonna see,\n\n363\n00:21:24.197 --> 00:21:28.763\none of the really weird things about it is\nis that the science between the large and\n\n364\n00:21:28.763 --> 00:21:31.400\nthe small, they just, they don't match up.\n\n365\n00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.220\nThere's actually a definitive\nbreak between the two.\n\n366\n00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:39.380\nSo one of the big things they're trying to\ndo in physics right now is they're trying\n\n367\n00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:44.290\nto unify the very small and\nthe very big and\n\n368\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.760\nget one unified set of laws and create\nwhat they call a grand unified theory.\n\n369\n00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.049\nAnd they're hoping by the time they get\nthis done they can maybe explain any piece\n\n370\n00:21:53.049 --> 00:21:57.467\nof matter or any physical interaction you\nwant within an equation that's probably\n\n371\n00:21:57.467 --> 00:22:01.914\na couple inches or an inch long, which is\nreally mind numbing if you think about it.\n\n372\n00:22:01.914 --> 00:22:02.529\n>> Absolutely.\n\n373\n00:22:02.529 --> 00:22:08.320\n>> That any material interaction could be\njust explained using that one formula.\n\n374\n00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.280\nBut what happens here is that when\nwe talk about quantum mechanics,\n\n375\n00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.720\nto give you some kind of idea, some of\nthe weird things that happen with it.\n\n376\n00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.260\nAnd this is going in the direction\nwhere it fits in with cryptography,\n\n377\n00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.210\nsome of the things is, for example,\n\n378\n00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:29.590\nif I had a tennis ball in my hand and\nI went to throw it.\n\n379\n00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.820\nQuantum mechanics and\nthe stuff that happens at that level says,\n\n380\n00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.840\nI could not only be throwing\nit this way at once.\n\n381\n00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.825\nI could also be throwing it that way and\nanother way all at the same time.\n\n382\n00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:42.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That tennis ball could be in multiple\n\n383\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.690\nplaces at once, and that doesn't\nviolate anything at all whatsoever.\n\n384\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.320\nIt's completely allowed.\n\n385\n00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.360\n>> To us and our brain and\n\n386\n00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.200\nwhat we're use to dealing with,\nthat violates everything we know.\n\n387\n00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.700\n>> Yes.\n>> If you throw the tennis ball in front\n\n388\n00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.590\nof you, then the tennis ball better\nbe flying out in front of you.\n\n389\n00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.270\nBut in quantum mechanics,\n\n390\n00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.398\nit's actually several possibilities\nof what that tennis ball is doing.\n\n391\n00:23:01.398 --> 00:23:03.681\n>> Yeah it's [CROSSTALK] invalid.\n\n392\n00:23:03.681 --> 00:23:05.910\nYeah, that's completely valid.\n\n393\n00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.805\nSo I could be throwing it in 100 different\ndirections, and it's a 100 different\n\n394\n00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:15.350\ndirections is all correct, every last one\nof them is a true and correct possibility.\n\n395\n00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:20.080\nAnd then you can even get down to\nthe point with individual electrons or\n\n396\n00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.260\nthe lepton family of particles,\nwhich the electron falls into,\n\n397\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.400\nthat particle can even,\ndepending on how you\n\n398\n00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:36.330\nlook at it, those things even have the\npossibility to alter the fabric of time.\n\n399\n00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:40.775\nThere's actually been theories\nthat are workable, that show that\n\n400\n00:23:40.775 --> 00:23:44.930\nthe electron can actually even go back and\nexist at different points in time, and\n\n401\n00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.900\nchange the outcome of something\nthat's already happening.\n\n402\n00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:48.570\nMm\n>> You know,\n\n403\n00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:52.339\nso that's something that, it's like,\nthat's science fiction stuff.\n\n404\n00:23:52.339 --> 00:23:52.980\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n405\n00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.710\n>> But they've actually shown that that's\n\n406\n00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.440\nsomething that definitely can occur, so\n\n407\n00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.281\nwe're talking about some really just\nfreaky stuff at the quantum level.\n\n408\n00:24:03.281 --> 00:24:08.141\nAnd that's why you really don't have a\ntheory yet between what's happening there\n\n409\n00:24:08.141 --> 00:24:12.180\nAnd what's happening at the stuff\nthat we can see and touch and feel.\n\n410\n00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:16.310\nLike James was saying,\nEinstein worked on it for 30 years.\n\n411\n00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.100\n>> Yeah, kind of a sad end to,\nwell, not sad.\n\n412\n00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.394\nThe guy was obviously brilliant and\nhad some great accomplishments, but\n\n413\n00:24:22.394 --> 00:24:26.127\ntowards the end, he did work on that for a\nlong time and never came up with anything.\n\n414\n00:24:26.127 --> 00:24:28.480\n>> Yeah, it actually drove him nuts.\n\n415\n00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.790\nSome of the stuff that we're\ngonna be talking about\n\n416\n00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:36.720\ntoday literally drove him nuts because\nit poked major holes in relativity.\n\n417\n00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.300\n>> Yeah.\n\n418\n00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:41.960\n>> In relativity, one of the main tenets\nof the theory of relativity is that\n\n419\n00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.770\nyou can't travel faster\nthan the speed of light.\n\n420\n00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.020\nThat's the ultimate speed limit.\n\n421\n00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:51.120\nIn fact, you can get 99%, 0.999, but\nyou can never reach the speed of light.\n\n422\n00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.060\nAnd there's a reason for that.\n\n423\n00:24:53.060 --> 00:25:00.670\nIf you've ever heard that being said,\nthat's because when you start speeding up,\n\n424\n00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:05.310\nyou reach a point of infinite mass where\nyou keep getting more and more and more.\n\n425\n00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:08.860\nAnd so infinite mass requires\ninfinite energy to push it, and\n\n426\n00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.900\nyou can't have infinite energy or\neither one.\n\n427\n00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:17.310\nSo, if you got to the speed of light you'd\nhave infinite mass and infinite energy.\n\n428\n00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.400\nThat doesn't match out.\n\n429\n00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.850\nSo, light can do that, but\nnothing else can do that.\n\n430\n00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.500\nSo that's one of the things they\ntalk about Star Trek physics and\n\n431\n00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.110\nstuff like that.\n\n432\n00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.580\nThat's why they say, oh well,\n\n433\n00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.710\nyou're never going to be able\nto travel the speed of light.\n\n434\n00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.600\nAnd that's why Star Trek geeks come in and\nsay, well,\n\n435\n00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.170\nthat's because it warps through and\nfolds space.\n\n436\n00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:34.850\n>> That's right.\n\n437\n00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.090\n>> They're talking about that, too, and\nthat's something that quantum mechanics\n\n438\n00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.970\nmay be able to solve, too, so they've\nalready been talking about that, too.\n\n439\n00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.800\nSo there's a lot of things that\nwould be growing out of this.\n\n440\n00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.470\nBut it drove Einstein, it literally drove\nEinstein nuts because there's things in\n\n441\n00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.150\nquantum mechanics that say, oh, yeah, you\ncan travel faster than the speed of light.\n\n442\n00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.295\nAnd Einstein's hair, maybe that's why\nhis hair was always all screwed up.\n\n443\n00:25:55.295 --> 00:25:57.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because he was like,\n\n444\n00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.990\nthat shouldn't exist.\n\n445\n00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:03.913\nHe actually, at a couple points,\nrewrote and cluged a couple things in his\n\n446\n00:26:03.913 --> 00:26:09.251\ntheory of relativity to keep this stuff\nfrom happening, and it still popped up.\n\n447\n00:26:09.251 --> 00:26:12.339\n>> Right, wow.\n>> So there's really some crazy stuff, but\n\n448\n00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:17.318\nthere's been a lot of brainy people over\nthe years working on this that are still\n\n449\n00:26:17.318 --> 00:26:20.470\nworking on it feverishly\nall over the world.\n\n450\n00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:24.550\nYou got people at CERN and\ndown in Stanford and\n\n451\n00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.860\nstuff like that all working on this,\nand a lot of exciting stuff and\n\n452\n00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.470\na lot of crazy stuff that's\nhard to get your head around.\n\n453\n00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:37.090\n>> Exactly, and then quantum cryptography\nthat we're talking about here is kinda\n\n454\n00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.080\na part of that or\n\n455\n00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.740\na result of a lot of what we've learned in\nthe studies in quantum mechanics, right?\n\n456\n00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:48.250\n>> Yes, what they're doing is they're\ntaking a lot of the concepts that happen\n\n457\n00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:54.630\nin quantum mechanics and saying, hey, we\ncould use that in the cryptography side to\n\n458\n00:26:54.630 --> 00:27:00.764\nsolve some of the problems that we've just\nhad for a long, long, long, long time.\n\n459\n00:27:00.764 --> 00:27:06.180\nAnd we did talk about some of these\nthings right before we had our break,\n\n460\n00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.970\nsome of the things that traditional\nphotography suffers from.\n\n461\n00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.240\nOne of the things was speed.\n\n462\n00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.330\nQuantum cryptography,\nif I'm telling you that's something, and\n\n463\n00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.750\nyou're gonna see that it's here.\n\n464\n00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:23.740\nIs if I tell you that, no matter what\nthe distance, no matter what's in between,\n\n465\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.330\nif I can make a change at one point,\nhave that change reflected someplace else\n\n466\n00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:33.960\ninstantaneously, you've solved\na hell of a speed problem there.\n\n467\n00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.652\n>> Right.\n\n468\n00:27:34.652 --> 00:27:37.580\n>> There's no, okay,\nI flipped a light switch over here and\n\n469\n00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.530\nlet me look at my watch.\n\n470\n00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:39.960\nOkay, now I got it.\n\n471\n00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.460\nThere's none of that.\n\n472\n00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.410\nI'm telling you, what does it take,\n\n473\n00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:48.740\nseven minutes for\nlight to travel from the Sun to us.\n\n474\n00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.330\nIf I'm telling you now I've got it,\nnow I have a way,\n\n475\n00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:57.100\ndue to the laws of quantum mechanics,\nto make a change here.\n\n476\n00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.960\nAnd it happens on the surface of\nthe Sun at the exact same time,\n\n477\n00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:06.150\nthere's no seven-minute delay,\nthe speed problem's been solved there.\n\n478\n00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:11.320\nSo that would be one thing,\nand of course, with that idea,\n\n479\n00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:15.470\nI mean, crypto systems, you can say\nthat there's a range issue in there,\n\n480\n00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.440\nbecause you have to figure out\nhow to get keys to people.\n\n481\n00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.540\nAnd distance would play a factor, I mean,\neven though the Internet's kind of solved\n\n482\n00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:27.500\na lot of that, do have a range\nissue that comes into play.\n\n483\n00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.980\n>> And key distribution is\na problem when we look at\n\n484\n00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.740\nour symmetric encryption algorithms.\n\n485\n00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.880\nOne of the problems that we\nhave is key distribution.\n\n486\n00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.930\nAnd we use asymmetric encryption to\nprotect that key during the transmission,\n\n487\n00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:41.710\nand quantum cryptography\ncan kind of step in and\n\n488\n00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:43.070\nsolve some of those problems for us.\n\n489\n00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:47.910\nIn fact, I've seen some places where they\nreally call it quantum key distribution.\n\n490\n00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.290\n>> Yeah, you're getting,\n\n491\n00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:54.800\nyou're seeing where this is gonna\nbe used and we'll build on that.\n\n492\n00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.220\n>> Okay, don't give it away then.\n\n493\n00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:00.820\n>> No, that's going the right direction\non it because you kinda gotta put it in\n\n494\n00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:05.860\nthe right spot to make sure that\nwe're getting the right answer and\n\n495\n00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.570\nright solution here.\n\n496\n00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:14.070\nBut yeah, if you'll think of distance\nas it factors into cryptography,\n\n497\n00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:18.549\nyou do have concern the longer a key has\nto travel, there's more of a delay there,\n\n498\n00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:20.680\nthen there's also a greater\nchance of eavesdropping.\n\n499\n00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.570\n>> Someone intercepting it.\n\n500\n00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.340\nThe longer the path is the more places\nsomebody could jump in there and\n\n501\n00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.630\ntry to intercept that key.\n\n502\n00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.530\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n503\n00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.980\nSo that brings us to something else.\n\n504\n00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:34.220\nWhen you talk about quantum cryptography\nor just talk about quantum mechanics,\n\n505\n00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:39.290\nperiod, I can move information from\none point to another instantaneously,\n\n506\n00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.060\nand there's no way for\nyou to intercept it in between the two,\n\n507\n00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.850\nbecause there's nothing there for\nyou to intercept.\n\n508\n00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.250\nIt just doesn't exist.\n\n509\n00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:47.620\nIt's here, it's over there.\n\n510\n00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.935\nThere was no, oh,\nhere it comes and there it goes.\n\n511\n00:29:49.935 --> 00:29:51.795\nNo, it's here and then it's there.\n\n512\n00:29:51.795 --> 00:29:54.695\nThat's it, so if that's what's happening-\n>> So it'd be me trying to intercept it,\n\n513\n00:29:54.695 --> 00:29:56.215\nI'm like, wait, where did it go?\n\n514\n00:29:56.215 --> 00:29:59.255\nWhat happened, I missed it,\nI blinked and I didn't see it go by.\n\n515\n00:29:59.255 --> 00:30:02.005\n>> Yeah,\nthere's literally nothing happened.\n\n516\n00:30:02.005 --> 00:30:04.745\nAnd it's fair to say that when\nwe talk about this stuff,\n\n517\n00:30:04.745 --> 00:30:09.355\nthere's nothing that with modern science,\nthe current state right now,\n\n518\n00:30:09.355 --> 00:30:11.920\nthat we can say, that we can measure.\n\n519\n00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.716\nWe can't,\nthere's nothing there that we can measure.\n\n520\n00:30:14.716 --> 00:30:18.940\nAnd so there's nothing there to intercept,\nnothing there to see.\n\n521\n00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.330\nMaybe there is something there but\nwe just haven't found it.\n\n522\n00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:26.180\nBut it's a fascinating thing that you can\nget something from point A to point B and\n\n523\n00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.620\nit's just, it's at A, then it's at B.\n\n524\n00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.920\nThere's no get in the car and\ndrive over there.\n\n525\n00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.794\nNo, it's here, it's there.\nOkay, what else do you need?\n\n526\n00:30:32.794 --> 00:30:34.849\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's just-\n\n527\n00:30:34.849 --> 00:30:36.486\n>> It's very impressive stuff.\n\n528\n00:30:36.486 --> 00:30:38.727\n>> Yeah, it hurts the brain.\n\n529\n00:30:38.727 --> 00:30:42.560\nIt just hurts the brain like crazy.\n\n530\n00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:48.340\nSo then you start to factor in something\nthat we're not even gonna get into here,\n\n531\n00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.350\nthe stuff that you can have something\nin multiple places at once,\n\n532\n00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.900\nand you're changing the laws of time.\n\n533\n00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.110\nYou can change pre-determined\noutcomes at this level.\n\n534\n00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.180\nI mean, there's a lot of\njust crazy stuff happening.\n\n535\n00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:09.260\nSo, with our quantum cryptography,\nwe've got this increase of speed,\n\n536\n00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.840\nwe've got the unlimited range.\n\n537\n00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.390\nI mean, light,\nthat's what we're sending, right?\n\n538\n00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.660\nWe're talking about photons here.\n\n539\n00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.980\n>> Well, you don't even\nnecessarily have to send that.\n\n540\n00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:26.420\nPhotons, you can use them to to change\nthe state of particles at this level.\n\n541\n00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.140\nBut you don't necessarily have to have it.\n\n542\n00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.313\n>> Okay, all right, so,\n\n543\n00:31:31.313 --> 00:31:35.150\ntell us a little bit more about how does\nthis fit into our cryptography thing.\n\n544\n00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:38.890\nWe see that it's something I can\nuse in a world of cryptography.\n\n545\n00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:40.310\nHow does it all work?\n\n546\n00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:46.270\nYeah, to get down this whole path\nof where we're going with it,\n\n547\n00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.670\nyou kinda gotta understand\na few basic things which I've\n\n548\n00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.980\ntried to simplify here\nas much as possible.\n\n549\n00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:56.938\nBecause I think this is an area that's\nreally fascinating, because it's more\n\n550\n00:31:56.938 --> 00:32:02.052\nthan theory, it's something that is\nturning into into a practical technology.\n\n551\n00:32:02.052 --> 00:32:05.653\nIt's something that they are,\nthe stuff I'm talking about here,\n\n552\n00:32:05.653 --> 00:32:09.833\nthat same body of work is what's gonna\nbe responsible for quantum computing.\n\n553\n00:32:09.833 --> 00:32:14.549\nSo if you've ever heard that term, the\nstuff that's gonna succeed Silicon based\n\n554\n00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:18.717\ncomputers and be the next generation\nof stuff and bring really true AI and\n\n555\n00:32:18.717 --> 00:32:21.180\nall that into the picture.\n\n556\n00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.520\nThis is what's going to do it, it's this\nbody of knowledge so we're talking about\n\n557\n00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.295\na piece of that, but you can imagine\nit's pretty complex, so I'm gonna\n\n558\n00:32:28.295 --> 00:32:32.545\ntry to break it down to something simple,\nso you can kinda see what's going on.\n\n559\n00:32:32.545 --> 00:32:34.555\nIt's still, I'm doing what I can, man.\n\n560\n00:32:34.555 --> 00:32:38.325\nThere's only so\nfar I can take it before we\n\n561\n00:32:38.325 --> 00:32:42.945\nlose something in the meaning or\nin the saying.\n\n562\n00:32:42.945 --> 00:32:45.795\nOne of the first things to talk about\nis something that a lot of people\n\n563\n00:32:45.795 --> 00:32:48.920\nhave probably heard about, but\nmay not have completely understood.\n\n564\n00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.490\nIt's something called\nthe Schrödinger's cat paradox.\n\n565\n00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:57.400\nAnd what this deals with is\nthis deals with what they call\n\n566\n00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.480\nthe super position of particles, or\nsuper position really of anything.\n\n567\n00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:05.010\nYou could have anything that\nexists in a super position.\n\n568\n00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:09.000\nThis is kind of a strange thing because\nwhat a super position refers to is just\n\n569\n00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.320\nkind of it just kind of possible\noutcomes that something could be in.\n\n570\n00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.020\nSo, when they look at it one of\nthe things they have on screen here\n\n571\n00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:23.910\nto show you where the Schroedinger's\ncat description came from,\n\n572\n00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:28.130\nthis is the thought\nexperiment that came out.\n\n573\n00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:33.350\nIs that what you have is you have a cat,\nthey show two cats in here but\n\n574\n00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:38.780\nwhat that's representing is\na superposition of a cat, okay.\n\n575\n00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.300\nSo the way this experiment works\n\n576\n00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.340\nis sealed inside a box we have\nthis radioactive substance, and\n\n577\n00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:50.700\nthen this Geiger counter is connected to\na relay which is connected to a hammer.\n\n578\n00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:55.600\nAnd then, as you can see,\nit has this flask of fluid in it.\n\n579\n00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.420\nAnd if that fluid breaks,\nwhat will happen is,\n\n580\n00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:03.825\nis it will fill that box with\na poisonous gas, and kill the cat.\n\n581\n00:34:03.825 --> 00:34:08.375\nOkay, now the radioactive substance,\nthe reason why that's there is\n\n582\n00:34:08.375 --> 00:34:13.285\nbecause that will decay at some rate,\nwe don't know what that is, we don't\n\n583\n00:34:13.285 --> 00:34:16.452\nknow what radioactive substance that is,\nbut that's gonna decay at some rate.\n\n584\n00:34:16.452 --> 00:34:19.932\nSo at some point, there's gonna be a\nparticle, like an alpha particle, emitted.\n\n585\n00:34:19.932 --> 00:34:23.872\nThat Geiger counter if it picks\nit up will trigger that relay and\n\n586\n00:34:23.872 --> 00:34:27.072\nthen all the other stuff will happen.\n\n587\n00:34:27.072 --> 00:34:28.222\nWell, the thing is,\n\n588\n00:34:28.222 --> 00:34:34.012\nwe don't know until we measure it,\nif that particle's been released or not.\n\n589\n00:34:34.012 --> 00:34:37.960\nSo if we step outside the box\nknowing what's in there\n\n590\n00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.880\nwe know there's a cat in the box,\nif I ask you is that cat alive or\n\n591\n00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.932\ndead, until you look\ninside it you don't know.\n\n592\n00:34:45.932 --> 00:34:50.930\nYou don't it exists that cat literally\nif you said is that cat alive or\n\n593\n00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:52.430\ndead the answer is yes.\n\n594\n00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:59.400\nIt literally is that cause it\nexists in that super position.\n\n595\n00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:05.490\nWhen you open it, what happens is,\nit's really weird to think, basically\n\n596\n00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:10.740\nif you wanna look at the universe actually\ncollapses around that one conclusion.\n\n597\n00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:14.730\nSo as soon as you observe it,\nthe cat alive or dead, your universe\n\n598\n00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:18.870\nis actually collapsed around or coalesced\naround that decision going forward.\n\n599\n00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:22.450\nCould you say there's another universe\nwhere we're going down another line of\n\n600\n00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:25.550\nthinking where the cat was if\nI found it alive over here,\n\n601\n00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.350\nthere's another universe that\nexists where the cat is dead.\n\n602\n00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.540\nYeah, you can say that.\n\n603\n00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:34.680\nYou can actually say that there's two\nlines of things going out from that point.\n\n604\n00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:39.410\n>> Right, so before I look in the box,\nthat cat could be either alive or dead.\n\n605\n00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.600\nSo that's what you're talking about,\nthat superposition.\n\n606\n00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.810\nIt's unknown.\n\n607\n00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:46.120\nCould exist in either state.\n\n608\n00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.580\nOnce I open the box, or measure it,\nnow it’s a known state.\n\n609\n00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.100\nIt’s either alive or dead, but not both.\n\n610\n00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.130\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n611\n00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.160\nYou just don’t know.\n\n612\n00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.100\nAnd it’s the same thing\nI’ve got right here,\n\n613\n00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:01.400\nsitting on the front of our\nlittle podium out here.\n\n614\n00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:05.150\nI’ve got a cup upside-down\nsitting out here.\n\n615\n00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:12.540\nAnd right now I could tell you there may\nor not be something underneath that cup.\n\n616\n00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:17.630\nI know the answer cuz I measured it and\nobserved it, you guys don't.\n\n617\n00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:25.510\nSo for you what's underneath this cup\nexists in a state of a super position.\n\n618\n00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:29.960\nIt's only when I remove that cup and\nyou see that actual tennis ball, or sorry,\n\n619\n00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:34.960\nthis golf ball sitting there, that now\nyou have a direct observable measurement.\n\n620\n00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.460\nWe now have measured it.\n\n621\n00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:42.070\nWe know it's there, so clearly\nthe other state doesn't exist anymore.\n\n622\n00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:43.560\nIt's someplace else now.\n\n623\n00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.180\nThere's actually literally someplace\nout there where I've removed it and\n\n624\n00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.750\nthat happened.\n\n625\n00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.330\n>> So for a while there, we didn't know,\nthere might have been a ball in there,\n\n626\n00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:52.470\nthere might not have been a ball in there.\n\n627\n00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:53.750\nThat was a superposition.\n\n628\n00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:54.570\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n629\n00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:59.290\n>> And then once we observed it, once you\nremoved the cup, we see the ball is there.\n\n630\n00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:00.375\nNow we know.\n\n631\n00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:02.440\nIt's there or not there, but\n\n632\n00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.060\nnot both, when the cup was still on\nthe table, could've been either one.\n\n633\n00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:06.930\n>> Exactly.\n\n634\n00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.400\nIt goes back to that same\nthing in the beginning.\n\n635\n00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.560\nWhen I was talking about the fact\nthat I could have this ball.\n\n636\n00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.640\nAnd I could throw it over here,\nand over here, and\n\n637\n00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.500\nover a couple of other directions,\nand they're all valid.\n\n638\n00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.080\nBecause if I, and\nit's kind of a crude example, but\n\n639\n00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.670\nif I did that and threw it off into\nall those multiple directions,\n\n640\n00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:29.540\nuntil you've actually observed it going in\none of those things, it's in all of them.\n\n641\n00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.140\n>> Right.\n\n642\n00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:31.150\n>> So.\n>> And please don't,\n\n643\n00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.320\nwe have lots of cameras and\nTV screens and things.\n\n644\n00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.689\nDon't throw it.\n>> Yeah, whatever, come on.\n\n645\n00:37:34.689 --> 00:37:37.379\nScience baby, that's what it's for.\n\n646\n00:37:37.379 --> 00:37:44.820\nSo, that's the way what Schrödinger's\ncat actually refers to.\n\n647\n00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.140\nAnd it's amazing cuz it\ncomes into other things that\n\n648\n00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.130\nyou may have been taught in science.\n\n649\n00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:55.840\nIf you go back to your basic science,\nthey teach you about an atom.\n\n650\n00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.260\nAnd they've got a nucleus\nof an atom there.\n\n651\n00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.170\nYou got your protons and\nneutrons sitting in there.\n\n652\n00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.180\nYou got your electrons orbiting it.\n\n653\n00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.542\nWhat do we always see?\n\n654\n00:38:06.542 --> 00:38:08.090\nWe see like those models.\n\n655\n00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:09.520\nElectrons orbiting that way.\n\n656\n00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.970\n>> Those pretty circular orbits.\n\n657\n00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:13.150\n>> Yup doesn't exist that way.\n\n658\n00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:14.670\nThat's a theory.\n\n659\n00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:18.160\nThat's the conceptual theoretical\nmodel to get your head around\n\n660\n00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.510\nIf you really were to break it\ndown to the mathematical model.\n\n661\n00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:25.570\nIt would be the nucleus, and\nthen you'd have a cloud sitting around it.\n\n662\n00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:30.020\nAnd that would just represent the\npotential energy state it could actually\n\n663\n00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.740\nexist in, that's it, possible\npositions that electron might be in.\n\n664\n00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.890\n>> Yeah,\nit's only until you observe it and\n\n665\n00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:40.370\nmake it and, observe it in one of\nthose positions, that's where it is.\n\n666\n00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:45.020\nWhen they told you in science you have one\norbit of electrons, then another one and\n\n667\n00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.890\nanother one and another one.\n\n668\n00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:50.690\nEach one of those orbits represents\na little bit of a higher energy state, and\n\n669\n00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:54.100\nso that's all they're saying,\nis that that cloud around that represents,\n\n670\n00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.600\nthe lowest cloud represents\nthe lowest energy state.\n\n671\n00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:01.020\nWe know that's where the electrons\ncould be, we just don't know where.\n\n672\n00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:05.330\nIt's only until you actually go, oh, there\nit is, that that's where the thing is.\n\n673\n00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:08.660\n>> Very interesting.\n\n674\n00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:15.730\nSo that's are superstition and\nour electron cloud model then.\n\n675\n00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:16.690\nLet's talk about,\n\n676\n00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:21.120\nwe said that really quantum mechanics\nstarts at the subatomic, right.\n\n677\n00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.890\nWhen we get to things\nsmaller than that atom.\n\n678\n00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:26.020\n>> Well when you get to\nthe size of an atom and\n\n679\n00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:29.930\nsmaller, then it goes,\nall the stuff starts kicking in.\n\n680\n00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:30.520\n>> Okay, and so\n\n681\n00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.380\nwhat are some of the things we find\ndown there when we get down that small?\n\n682\n00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:39.720\n>> There's a lot of stuff happening for\nwhat we're talking about, we're\n\n683\n00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:46.380\njust talking individual particles, the\nelectrons, protons, neutrons type stuff.\n\n684\n00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.530\nBut there's actually stuff\nunderneath that as well.\n\n685\n00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.790\nThere is your quarks and\ndifferent combinations of quarks.\n\n686\n00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:58.180\nThere's actually a family of six quarks,\nthe up and down, the top and bottom and\n\n687\n00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.159\nthe charmed and strange.\n\n688\n00:39:59.159 --> 00:39:59.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's\n\n689\n00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.480\nnames they came up with that people.\n\n690\n00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.060\n>> I did not come up with those.\n\n691\n00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.602\nIn fact, fascinatingly enough,\n\n692\n00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:07.695\nthey're still making breakthroughs\non all this stuff all the time.\n\n693\n00:40:07.695 --> 00:40:12.467\nOne of the things they were actually able\nto discover even though it was theorized\n\n694\n00:40:12.467 --> 00:40:16.485\nfor years It was just a handful of\nyears ago they found the top quark.\n\n695\n00:40:16.485 --> 00:40:19.030\nIt was actually the heaviest\nof those particles.\n\n696\n00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.515\nThey were actually able to find it\nbecause they got a high enough power,\n\n697\n00:40:22.515 --> 00:40:27.780\nparticle collider to be able to.\n\n698\n00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.020\nTo observe it.\n\n699\n00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.870\nSo it was a big thing.\n\n700\n00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:31.390\nOkay.\nFor\n\n701\n00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:34.090\na bunch of physics nerds sitting\naround going, woo, nothing.\n\n702\n00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:36.980\nNo flashes of light,\nno God moment or anything.\n\n703\n00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.940\nJust a little number on\na computer changed and, oh look.\n\n704\n00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:44.790\nIt's a top quark, that's what it was,\nand they went crazy over it.\n\n705\n00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.780\nSo that was a big one.\n\n706\n00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:51.840\nSame, CERN's still doing it, which is\nthey have a big supercollider over there,\n\n707\n00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.900\nthey just found the Higgs boson not\ntoo long ago, which is something else.\n\n708\n00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.800\n>> Still have people protesting outside\nafraid that they're gonna create a black\n\n709\n00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.550\nhole with one of these collisions?\n\n710\n00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:05.120\n>> Yeah you still have people that\nbelieve that that's a probability but.\n\n711\n00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:06.755\nOkay.\n\n712\n00:41:06.755 --> 00:41:08.740\n[LAUGH] If they think that,\n\n713\n00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:12.090\nthat'll be great to create a black\nhole to throw some of them in.\n\n714\n00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:12.850\n>> Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n715\n00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:13.650\nStick them all up there.\n\n716\n00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:14.970\n>> Yeah.\n\n717\n00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:16.290\n>> I'll tell you what.\n\n718\n00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:19.251\nLadies and gentlemen, if I can get that\nout of my mouth, it is about time for\n\n719\n00:41:19.251 --> 00:41:21.188\nus to take a break, so\nwe're going to step away.\n\n720\n00:41:21.188 --> 00:41:25.385\nWhen we come back, we're gonna see where\nthis quantum mechanics in, fits into, and\n\n721\n00:41:25.385 --> 00:41:28.090\ngive you some examples of\nsome quantum cryptography.\n\n722\n00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.208\nSo stay tuned.\n\n723\n00:41:29.208 --> 00:41:29.789\nWe'll be right back.\n\n724\n00:41:29.789 --> 00:41:36.754\n[MUSIC]\n\n725\n00:41:36.754 --> 00:41:38.728\nAll right, welcome back,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n726\n00:41:38.728 --> 00:41:42.135\nSo, we left off talking about,\nyou know, the future of cryptography.\n\n727\n00:41:42.135 --> 00:41:45.225\nAnd we started getting\ninto quantum cryptography.\n\n728\n00:41:45.225 --> 00:41:47.182\nAnd to understand quantum cryptography.\n\n729\n00:41:47.182 --> 00:41:50.812\nWe had to take a brief\nlook at quantum physics or\n\n730\n00:41:50.812 --> 00:41:52.642\nquantum mechanics as they like to call it.\n\n731\n00:41:52.642 --> 00:41:56.332\nSo we discussed a little bit of that,\ntalked about a couple of those theories.\n\n732\n00:41:56.332 --> 00:42:00.772\nLet's see how we can bring it back\nthen into the world of cryptography.\n\n733\n00:42:00.772 --> 00:42:02.662\n>> Yeah.\nThe way this comes into the world of\n\n734\n00:42:02.662 --> 00:42:04.652\ncryptography, just kinda\npushing along in it.\n\n735\n00:42:04.652 --> 00:42:08.940\nThere's various little\nitems that help us out.\n\n736\n00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:12.930\nOne of the things that's really\nimportant to understand on this is\n\n737\n00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.230\nsomething called spin.\n\n738\n00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.820\nParticles spin, move or less,\n\n739\n00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:24.170\nthis is the term they use\nto describe its spin.\n\n740\n00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:28.050\nThey also describe when you get down to\nquarks and stuff like that, and they'll\n\n741\n00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:33.520\nstart explaining stuff, those particles in\nterms of color, like red, green, and blue.\n\n742\n00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.830\nThey don't really have that.\n\n743\n00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:37.420\nBut that's just a way to classify that.\n\n744\n00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.930\nSo they talk about spin.\n\n745\n00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:43.438\nIt's a same type of thing,\nit just helps us visualize, this.\n\n746\n00:42:43.438 --> 00:42:49.020\nSo, what I've got on my screen\nhere is just a quick diagram,\n\n747\n00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:52.640\nillustrating, that I've got\na particle being represented here.\n\n748\n00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.880\nSpinning both clockwise and\ncounterclockwise, and particles\n\n749\n00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:02.860\nbasically can have a spin of, and this is\ncuz of some weird stuff, they can have\n\n750\n00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:08.175\na spin of one, a spin of one-half,\nor they can have some weird things.\n\n751\n00:43:08.175 --> 00:43:13.095\nThe spin just to kind of get\na little bit off side to tell you\n\n752\n00:43:13.095 --> 00:43:17.765\nwhat this type stuff means,\nis if you look at something like\n\n753\n00:43:17.765 --> 00:43:24.727\na dinner plate that has no patterns or\nanything on it.\n\n754\n00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:29.477\nYou could move that any number of\ndegrees and it would still be the same\n\n755\n00:43:29.477 --> 00:43:32.998\nto you provided there's no distinguishing\nmarks, it would still look the same.\n\n756\n00:43:32.998 --> 00:43:37.498\nYou know, now if you put a mark on one\nside on a point on that dinner plate,\n\n757\n00:43:37.498 --> 00:43:41.488\nif you moved it even a little bit,\nthat mark's not in the same spot.\n\n758\n00:43:41.488 --> 00:43:41.988\n>> Right.\n\n759\n00:43:41.988 --> 00:43:47.069\n>> You'd have to do one full\nspin to get it back where it is.\n\n760\n00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:50.009\nSo it looks like it did when\nyou originally observed it.\n\n761\n00:43:50.009 --> 00:43:52.789\nNow, if you look at something\nlike a playing card,\n\n762\n00:43:52.789 --> 00:43:58.129\nyour average playing card that has one\nof the suited ones that has the king or\n\n763\n00:43:58.129 --> 00:44:01.280\nqueen on it, those would be\nsaid to have a spin of a half.\n\n764\n00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:05.560\nIf you actually turned it a half\nrevolution, it looks the same.\n\n765\n00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:10.570\nSo, that's kind of some of\nthe significance of a spin.\n\n766\n00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:13.360\n>> Talk about what it takes to get\nit back to its original position,\n\n767\n00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.570\nwhere that's a half a rotation,\nor a full rotation.\n\n768\n00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:18.730\nYeah and it really gets screwy and\n\n769\n00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:24.670\nthere's really not a good\nexample of it in everyday use.\n\n770\n00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:28.310\nI mean yes at this level there is, they\ncan have particles with a spin of two and\n\n771\n00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:29.018\nstuff like that.\n\n772\n00:44:29.018 --> 00:44:31.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which means, you can turn it if you\n\n773\n00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:35.340\nvisualize it this way, turn it 360 degrees\nand it still would not look the same,\n\n774\n00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:39.390\nyou'd have to turn it another 360 degrees\nbefore it would look the same again.\n\n775\n00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.185\n>> Okay.\n>> Try picturing that in real life.\n\n776\n00:44:41.185 --> 00:44:44.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We try to find a situation like that,\n\n777\n00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:45.370\nbut anyway.\n\n778\n00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:50.280\nSo every particle is measured\nhaving some sort of spin, so\n\n779\n00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.400\njust leave it at that, and that's\nimportant because what we're gonna do.\n\n780\n00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.770\nThe next thing we've gotta do\nto use this in cryptography,\n\n781\n00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:59.570\nis we have to know about something\nthat is really kind of cutting,\n\n782\n00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:03.640\nbleeding edge type stuff is something\ncalled quantum entanglement.\n\n783\n00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.380\nAnd this is where it gets really strange.\n\n784\n00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:08.990\nThere's a lot of, no pun intended,\nblack holes here.\n\n785\n00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:16.080\nWhat you have is you have a situation\nwhere you've got particles when they come\n\n786\n00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:20.550\ninto existence, or they somehow bump into\none another, they get a link between them.\n\n787\n00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:21.380\nNot a visible link.\n\n788\n00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.850\nThere's not like an umbilical cord or\nsomething going between them, but\n\n789\n00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:24.480\nthey're linked.\n\n790\n00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.640\nAnd they're linked in such\na way that the spin on one\n\n791\n00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.170\nis gonna be the complete\nopposite than the other.\n\n792\n00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:34.930\nSo, in the diagram that I had up here,\nyou've got one particle it's got\n\n793\n00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:39.290\nthe spin of +1/2 and\nyou've got one that has a spin of -1/2.\n\n794\n00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:44.920\nIf you bring a plus and a minus\ntogether of a 1/2 on both sides, 0.\n\n795\n00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:50.040\nAnd that's something we've been\ntaught in physics for a long time.\n\n796\n00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.990\nEven at the macroscopic scale.\n\n797\n00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:56.920\nIs that the law of conservation of\nenergy or conservation of mass is that\n\n798\n00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.590\neverything has to equal out, energy and\nmatter has to equal out to zero.\n\n799\n00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:04.830\nAnd that's what we have here,\nis that those things equal out to zero.\n\n800\n00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:08.290\nYou can't have a situation\nwhere one gets taken out, and\n\n801\n00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:11.260\nyou have just a half sitting out\nwith nothing to cancel it out.\n\n802\n00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.310\nSo we've got two particles\nthat are quantum entangled.\n\n803\n00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:16.810\nAnd they both gotta spin of a half,\nwhich is significant so\n\n804\n00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:19.140\nthey're going opposite ways.\n\n805\n00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.910\nSo what happens here is that I\ncan take those two particles and\n\n806\n00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:27.390\nif I were to go through going\nback to Schroedinger stuff again.\n\n807\n00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:31.820\nIf I was to go through and\nmeasure one, and say okay,\n\n808\n00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.740\nthis is the position it's in,\nas soon as I measure the position here,\n\n809\n00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.755\nthe other one's gonna\nhave the exact opposite.\n\n810\n00:46:38.755 --> 00:46:41.170\nCuz it has to be, it has to cancel out.\n\n811\n00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:44.220\nSo that will stay true no\n\n812\n00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.780\nmatter how far away you move\nthose particles from one another.\n\n813\n00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:50.850\nIf they could go a whole universe apart,\nand\n\n814\n00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:54.630\nthey could still obey that\nsame basic principle.\n\n815\n00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:58.690\nIn fact, this is kind of just looking\nat it, is that you have two particles.\n\n816\n00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:02.730\nYou have one that you\nobserve in its up state.\n\n817\n00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:06.440\nSomewhere else, it's quantum\nentangled particle, or partner,\n\n818\n00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.540\nsitting someplace else,\nis going to be pointing in a down state.\n\n819\n00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.330\nIt has to be in that exact opposite state.\n\n820\n00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:14.330\nAnd it's a really,\n\n821\n00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:18.970\nreally weird thing because there's\nno visible link between them.\n\n822\n00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:22.484\nThere seems to be no\ndistance limitation there.\n\n823\n00:47:22.484 --> 00:47:26.259\nThis has been observed,\nthis has been proven.\n\n824\n00:47:26.259 --> 00:47:32.275\nThe greatest distance they've got here\non earth has been about 300 miles and\n\n825\n00:47:32.275 --> 00:47:38.802\nI want to say they did it right here in\nFlorida, somewhere area right around here.\n\n826\n00:47:38.802 --> 00:47:44.412\nThat they were able to observe\nthe quantum entanglement of behaviour.\n\n827\n00:47:44.412 --> 00:47:48.532\nSo it's just a fascinating\nthing when you think about it.\n\n828\n00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:49.982\nThat hey to make a change here and boom.\n\n829\n00:47:49.982 --> 00:47:52.611\nOr make an observation here and\nthe exact opposite.\n\n830\n00:47:52.611 --> 00:47:56.311\nIt happens over there, and there's no\nvisible link, and it's instantaneous.\n\n831\n00:47:56.311 --> 00:47:57.581\n>> Hm, very fascinating.\n\n832\n00:47:57.581 --> 00:47:59.481\n>> So the implication this has,\n\n833\n00:47:59.481 --> 00:48:05.460\nand this is something that if you go and\nread relativity.\n\n834\n00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.019\nAnd you look at some of\nthe stuff that Einstein said,\n\n835\n00:48:08.019 --> 00:48:10.819\nthis is something he called\nspooky action at a distance.\n\n836\n00:48:10.819 --> 00:48:15.595\nSo that led to and is wrapped\naround all of this, and it's really\n\n837\n00:48:15.595 --> 00:48:21.089\nsomething that kind of Confused him,\nand had him frustrated for a while.\n\n838\n00:48:21.089 --> 00:48:24.330\nCuz like, how can that actually happen?\n\n839\n00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:27.600\n>> Well, I don't feel so\nbad if Einstein was confused.\n\n840\n00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.490\nWow.\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n841\n00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:32.870\nit was just something that\nhe felt shouldn't exist.\n\n842\n00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:39.260\nAnd he tried and tried and tried,\nand this loophole was still there.\n\n843\n00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:46.090\nBut now it's something that's been\nseen and observed and has been proven.\n\n844\n00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:49.600\nSo we've got that quantum entanglement\nnow, the thing is is that,\n\n845\n00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.890\nhow do we use this for\ncryptography to go to that next step?\n\n846\n00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:57.570\nWell, this could be used as something\nthat you mentioned earlier Mike,\n\n847\n00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:58.335\na key exchange.\n\n848\n00:48:58.335 --> 00:48:59.515\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Quantum key exchange.\n\n849\n00:48:59.515 --> 00:49:01.380\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> What we're doing here is we're using\n\n850\n00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:06.340\nthis to move a key someplace else and\nas bits.\n\n851\n00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.540\n>> We know we can do keys in bits,\nno problem.\n\n852\n00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.200\nSo the way we're gonna do that,\nis we're just gonna choose a state and\n\n853\n00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.180\nsay, if we're gonna say up or down,\nthose up or downs are gonna be binary.\n\n854\n00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:20.120\nIt's up is one,\ndown is zero, or vice versa.\n\n855\n00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.255\nYou could choose whatever\nposition you want,\n\n856\n00:49:22.255 --> 00:49:25.430\ncuz these aren't the only spins\nthat particle are gonna have.\n\n857\n00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:29.260\nThey can have different spins, they can\nbe spinning any number of ways, but\n\n858\n00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:33.000\nwhat we're saying here is just making\nit easy and saying up and down.\n\n859\n00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.790\nBut the trick is,\nwhatever spin you're going to use,\n\n860\n00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:43.360\nyou define it, one half of it as being\nthat one, the other half is being a zero.\n\n861\n00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.890\nSo if I make that here, grab one here and\nit becomes a one over here,\n\n862\n00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.140\nit's a zero over there,\nthat person sees it.\n\n863\n00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.120\nAnd we can just use that to transmit\na key over any distance just\n\n864\n00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:59.200\nby doing these observations on that\nparticle or influencing that particle.\n\n865\n00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.330\nAnd so,\ntherefore you've got the instantaneous,\n\n866\n00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:05.330\nsuper fast eavesdropping-proof\nway of transmitting the key.\n\n867\n00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:08.620\nAll you have to do then, is just drop\nthat key into your algorithm and\n\n868\n00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.180\nyou're ready to go.\n\n869\n00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:15.560\nThis is something that\nseveral governments and\n\n870\n00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:18.480\nseveral agencies\nare already working on for\n\n871\n00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:23.390\nthis, for this specific purpose,\nas well as other things.\n\n872\n00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:26.070\nThis quantum entanglement they\nfeel is gonna be responsible for\n\n873\n00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:31.220\ndoing a whole lot of other stuff,\nmaking a ton of other things popular.\n\n874\n00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:36.970\nThey're talking about things like\nteleportation, stuff like that.\n\n875\n00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:42.680\nAnd all these different types\nof energy sources coming out\n\n876\n00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:48.150\nof things involving this, or somehow\nrevolving around this field of study.\n\n877\n00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:52.040\n>> I put you guys a link up there for\na company, Swiss Quantum.\n\n878\n00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.850\nI think they're some of the first\npeople that actually created\n\n879\n00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:59.880\nsome devices that can do this\nkinda Quantum key distribution?\n\n880\n00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:03.060\n>> Yeah, is the the one that's doing\nit with voting machines that you found.\n\n881\n00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.940\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n882\n00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:10.060\n>> It's weird, yeah, their already doing\nit on voting machines of all things,\n\n883\n00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:12.740\njust because of the.\n\n884\n00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.600\n>> Because of the security of it.\n\n885\n00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.870\n>> And no hanging chads.\n\n886\n00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:17.350\n>> Yeah, no hanging chads whatsoever.\n\n887\n00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:21.455\n>> Yeah, in Florida,\nwe can really appreciate that here.\n\n888\n00:51:21.455 --> 00:51:22.930\n[LAUGH]\n>> You had to bring that up, didn't you.\n\n889\n00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:24.030\n>> I'm sorry.\n[LAUGH].\n\n890\n00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:25.470\n>> The other cool thing about this is,\n\n891\n00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:30.130\nif someone was to somehow try to tamper\nwith the key, let's say they were trying\n\n892\n00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:31.930\nto get involved in this process\n>> And\n\n893\n00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:36.750\nsomehow did something because\nof the way this stuff works.\n\n894\n00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:40.085\nI saw Heisenberg being mentioned in there,\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\n895\n00:51:40.085 --> 00:51:41.010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n896\n00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:45.250\n>> That states that you\ncan know the speed or\n\n897\n00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:47.630\nthe position of a particle, but not both.\n\n898\n00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:53.640\nYou can never know both accurately,\nso if you have a particle rolling by,\n\n899\n00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.940\nI can measure the speed, but I can't\nget an accurate fix on its position.\n\n900\n00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:01.620\nBut the moment I measure at a certain\npoint, its got zero speed, but\n\n901\n00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:03.330\nI know its position exactly.\n\n902\n00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:06.180\nAnd so that applies here.\n\n903\n00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:09.680\nThat if someone's get in the system and\nin any way influenced these,\n\n904\n00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.640\nthat's gonna be translated directly in\nthe system and I can pick up the change.\n\n905\n00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.530\nSo, that's another big benefit of it,\n\n906\n00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:21.940\nusing the laws of physics\nto do this cool stuff.\n\n907\n00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:23.830\nBut yeah,\nthey are actively working on this.\n\n908\n00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:28.380\nAnd this has already been\nproven to have happened,\n\n909\n00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.630\nyou'll still see some\nuncertainty about it.\n\n910\n00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:34.140\nI'm sure there's someone out here or\nthat someone that could watch this and\n\n911\n00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:37.390\nsay, oh well, wait there's some\nholes in what you said, or\n\n912\n00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:43.330\ndeficiencies in what you said, because\nsome other scientists are saying that.\n\n913\n00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:46.190\ni fully understand that and expect that.\n\n914\n00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:50.740\nI mean, there are some scientists out\nthere I believe with quantum entanglement\n\n915\n00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.540\nthat there's actually some\nadditional information\n\n916\n00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:57.280\nbeing transmitted when you do that\nstate change between the two.\n\n917\n00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.490\nAnd they're still doing some\ncrazy things with that.\n\n918\n00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:06.332\nIn fact, one of the things that comes\nout of that, is if you go back to Dan's\n\n919\n00:53:06.332 --> 00:53:11.315\nfavorite, Schroedinger's cat,\nif you look at Schroedinger's cat,\n\n920\n00:53:11.315 --> 00:53:16.935\nyou have that box, and if you,\nlet's just say we had two different boxes.\n\n921\n00:53:16.935 --> 00:53:19.365\nThe whole quantum entanglement type deal.\n\n922\n00:53:19.365 --> 00:53:24.125\nYou can say you have a situation where\nthere's a possibility if the cat's alive\n\n923\n00:53:24.125 --> 00:53:26.100\nin this box, he's dead over here.\n\n924\n00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.310\nBut it could also be dead over here and\nalive over here.\n\n925\n00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:29.730\nSo we got two possibilities.\n\n926\n00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:31.396\n>> So if I kill this cat I could\nbring the other cat to life.\n\n927\n00:53:31.396 --> 00:53:33.820\n[LAUGH]\n>> If you want to look at it that way.\n\n928\n00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:38.440\nBut if you look at it as a particle\nthat one has to be in an opposite state.\n\n929\n00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.520\nWhatever state you observe this one in.\n\n930\n00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:44.259\nThis one automatically has to be in\nthe opposite state, observation or\n\n931\n00:53:44.259 --> 00:53:45.454\nnot, has to be there.\n\n932\n00:53:45.454 --> 00:53:49.358\nSo if you open it up, the cat's alive\nover here, it's dead over there,\n\n933\n00:53:49.358 --> 00:53:51.735\nyou know it, because they're entangled.\n\n934\n00:53:51.735 --> 00:53:52.520\n>> You don't have to see it.\n\n935\n00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:57.483\nYou know.\n>> Yeah, you know [CROSSTALK] exactly.\n\n936\n00:53:57.483 --> 00:54:01.389\n>> After we had talked about the show,\nI was reading up on it as much as I could.\n\n937\n00:54:01.389 --> 00:54:06.198\nAnd I think some of the limitations that\nwe saw on these were, it's fiber, right?\n\n938\n00:54:06.198 --> 00:54:08.174\nThey're transmitting photons,\n\n939\n00:54:08.174 --> 00:54:12.170\ntypically using an LED cause they\ncan generate a single photon.\n\n940\n00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:14.730\nUnlike a lot of light sources\nthat create bursts of photons.\n\n941\n00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:19.490\nAnd so it has to be fiber, and\nit has to be a direct, not a direct link.\n\n942\n00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:22.230\nThey have shown that they can route this,\n\n943\n00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:27.460\nbut obviously if you don't have fiber then\nyou can't transmit that beam of light.\n\n944\n00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:33.190\n>> Well that's the way they're doing\nit now, because the way this works.\n\n945\n00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:38.150\nThey're not really sure how\nthe entanglement situation itself happens.\n\n946\n00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:42.980\nRight now they're using fiber and\nthe transmission of photons to energize\n\n947\n00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:47.050\nthe particles and to get those electrons\nto bump up and move appropriately.\n\n948\n00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.990\nBut there's other ways to do it.\n\n949\n00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:52.284\nBut we just don't have those\nways to reliably do it.\n\n950\n00:54:52.284 --> 00:54:55.713\n[CROSSTALK] I wouldn't need to transmit\nanything I had to change it on my end and\n\n951\n00:54:55.713 --> 00:54:59.330\nautomatically change on the other end,\nand there's nothing even to transmit.\n\n952\n00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:01.856\n>> Yeah you wouldn't even have to.\n\n953\n00:55:01.856 --> 00:55:05.158\nThere's something there that we\njust don't know what it is and\n\n954\n00:55:05.158 --> 00:55:09.584\nthere's no observable stuff based on all\nthe scientific methods we have nowadays,\n\n955\n00:55:09.584 --> 00:55:11.980\nthat there's, we don't know what that is.\n\n956\n00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:17.020\nBut they do use photons to\ninfluence these particles and\n\n957\n00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:21.860\nto create pairs of them that\nhave certain properties.\n\n958\n00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:26.460\nBut they don't have to do that, but\n\n959\n00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:29.980\nother things are gonna come into\nplay once we start doing that.\n\n960\n00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:34.870\nThere's a whole bunch of things, and\nit's a fascinating area, it really is.\n\n961\n00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:37.050\nThat's all I can really say about it.\n\n962\n00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:38.410\n>> Yeah, all right.\n\n963\n00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:41.660\nWell Sean,\nthat's a pretty interesting look\n\n964\n00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:44.290\nat where things are going in\nthe world of cryptography.\n\n965\n00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:48.090\nI know we, we started out at the beginning\nof our episodes way back in the ancient\n\n966\n00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:50.180\ntimes with the hieroglyphs, and\n\n967\n00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.540\nwe've moved all the way up\nto quantum cryptography, and\n\n968\n00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:59.530\nstuff that's still in theory, and they're\nstill trying to develop ways to do this.\n\n969\n00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:02.330\nThey're talking about a complete\ncoverage of cryptography.\n\n970\n00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:03.450\nExcellent book.\n\n971\n00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:06.669\nAnything else we wanna throw in\non the future of cryptography and\n\n972\n00:56:06.669 --> 00:56:07.930\nquantum cryptography?\n\n973\n00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:12.746\n>> Quantum cryptography itself\nis still evolving so there's,\n\n974\n00:56:12.746 --> 00:56:17.838\nwe could do courses and courses on\nthat which would get really just\n\n975\n00:56:17.838 --> 00:56:24.060\nCrazy really quick, because all\nthe quantum mechanics of it get involved.\n\n976\n00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:26.190\nIt's still evolving, like I said.\n\n977\n00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:30.500\nYou can go out there and do research on\nit now if you found that fascinating.\n\n978\n00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.570\nI hope you found it interesting.\n\n979\n00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:39.010\nBut you can go out and do reading on\nthe quantum mechanics and entanglement.\n\n980\n00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:41.470\nThere's things like\nquantum cohesion in there.\n\n981\n00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:46.460\nThere's a bunch of just crazy things,\nand that will take you down the road of\n\n982\n00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:50.450\nwhere you can start studying\nquantum cryptography.\n\n983\n00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:52.860\nIt's definitely still an evolving area.\n\n984\n00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:57.330\nFor other things, the future of\ncryptography outside of that,\n\n985\n00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:59.840\nit's like we were saying at\nthe beginning of this episode,\n\n986\n00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:05.460\nit's something that by going through\na course like this or reading the book,\n\n987\n00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:08.140\nand then just getting some practice\nwith it and understanding it.\n\n988\n00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:12.740\nIt's something that's going to become\ninvaluable because it's used in so\n\n989\n00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:13.770\nmany different places.\n\n990\n00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:18.640\nYou're seeing so many different\nimplementations, greater emphasis on\n\n991\n00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:24.040\ntechnology as people are more\nconcerned about being hacked,\n\n992\n00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.770\nor have an identity theft happen.\n\n993\n00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:29.390\nAll these things, you're gonna see\nencryption play a bigger and bigger and\n\n994\n00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:32.070\nbigger role all the time.\n\n995\n00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:34.010\nPeople are concerned about this.\n\n996\n00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:39.600\nLook at how many people,\nafter Snowden had his deal happen,\n\n997\n00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.350\nlook at how many people all of\na sudden were like, I need to use Tor.\n\n998\n00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:44.060\nWell, Tor uses encryption.\n\n999\n00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.330\nYou'd encrypt your drive.\n\n1000\n00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:46.110\nOkay, I need to do that.\n\n1001\n00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.110\nIt just keeps going on and on and on.\n\n1002\n00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:52.260\nAnd they're even coming\nup with technologies that\n\n1003\n00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:55.830\nrely heavily on encryption\nsuch as smart wallets.\n\n1004\n00:57:55.830 --> 00:57:56.420\n>> Yeah.\n\n1005\n00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:03.170\n>> Those are relatively new area to do\nanother level of identity protection.\n\n1006\n00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:06.610\nYou can look up something\ncalled the Wocket Wallet.\n\n1007\n00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:10.910\nIt's like Pocket with a W, you look up\nsomething called the Wocket Wallet and\n\n1008\n00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:12.630\nit's something you can code into.\n\n1009\n00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:16.340\nYou can code your credit cards into and\nonce you've done that,\n\n1010\n00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.870\nyou can effectively leave\nyour credit cards at home.\n\n1011\n00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:21.590\nAnd all you have to do on the front\nof it is punch in some stuff and\n\n1012\n00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:26.320\nscan your fingerprint and\nit will go ahead and sign and\n\n1013\n00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.330\ndo all the stuff to a card\nthat you can pull out.\n\n1014\n00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:31.350\nIt programs the card on the fly.\n\n1015\n00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:36.595\nYou pull it out, becomes that credit card,\nyou run it, and it's one-time use.\n\n1016\n00:58:36.595 --> 00:58:41.375\nAnd because of the way things are stored\nwith heavy-duty encryption, and the way\n\n1017\n00:58:41.375 --> 00:58:44.795\nit's authenticated to you which also uses\nencryption with the fingerprints and\n\n1018\n00:58:44.795 --> 00:58:48.475\nall that,\nyou've got a pretty robust solution, and\n\n1019\n00:58:48.475 --> 00:58:52.310\nit's just popping up in so many areas.\n\n1020\n00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:55.870\nSo yeah, just something to think about.\n\n1021\n00:58:55.870 --> 00:59:00.350\nThat's all I can really say is yeah,\nwe cover a lot of fascinating stuff and\n\n1022\n00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:02.340\nit's gonna be seen more and\nmore and more so\n\n1023\n00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:05.710\nthe understanding you got here\nis gonna prove invaluable.\n\n1024\n00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:09.590\n>> Your book is really that introduction\nto cryptology where you choose to go with\n\n1025\n00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:11.519\nit after this,\nthe sky is the limit, right?\n\n1026\n00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:13.440\nAll right.\n\n1027\n00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.080\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed the show.\n\n1028\n00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.410\nRemember, if you're watching the show,\nand you've got
