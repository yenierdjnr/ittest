Series,\n\n3\n00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:10.005\nMike Rodrick here and\nwith me is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:10.776\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:13.311\n>> Doing pretty good today, Mike.\n\n6\n00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:14.671\nHow about you?\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:16.796\nLooking forward to this.\n\n8\n00:00:16.796 --> 00:00:24.600\nWe are going to be spending the next week\ncovering Sean's book called Cryptography.\n\n9\n00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.710\nSo Sean, first of all, why this book?\n\n10\n00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.362\nI know we got a lot of different\nbooks out there that I can go and\n\n11\n00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.482\nget about cryptography and other than\nthe fact that you wrote this one,\n\n12\n00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:34.000\n[LAUGH] what makes this one so good?\n\n13\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.235\n>> There you go.\n\n14\n00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.095\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or is there any other reason?\n\n15\n00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:38.975\n[LAUGH]\n>> Do you need another one?\n\n16\n00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:40.765\n>> That's what I was thinking.\n\n17\n00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:42.671\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n18\n00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:44.890\nI've always had an interest\nin cryptography.\n\n19\n00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.180\nIt's been something that's just\nfascinated me since I was very young.\n\n20\n00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.060\nWhen I set about writing this book,\n\n21\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.780\nit comes on the heels of being\ninterested in this for years, but\n\n22\n00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.490\nonly seeing books that did beginning\nstuff right in the first chapter or two,\n\n23\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.220\nand then all of a sudden they're jumping\ninto all these abstract concepts.\n\n24\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.160\nNow, someone jumping in new to\nthat is gonna have a problem.\n\n25\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.252\nI mean, if you're an experienced person,\nif you're, we joke around,\n\n26\n00:01:11.252 --> 00:01:14.120\na propeller head,\nyou understand mathematics and all that,\n\n27\n00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.300\nthen maybe you're gonna get, jumping\ninto the advanced stuff really quick.\n\n28\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.940\nBut I wanted something that was easily\nunderstandable, dispensed with as many\n\n29\n00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.190\nof the formulas as possible, which I\navoided putting any of them in there.\n\n30\n00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.960\nI think there's like one or\ntwo in there, that's about it.\n\n31\n00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.130\nAnd so, I tried to make it accessible and\ngive examples and\n\n32\n00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.770\nmake it easy to understand.\n\n33\n00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.520\nSo in the end,\nthe result was a book that I'm proud of,\n\n34\n00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.890\nthat does make it easy,\ndoes show examples, and\n\n35\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.410\nmakes it accessible to anybody that\nis working with mathematics or not.\n\n36\n00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.270\nSomebody that is in IT,\nwhich this would be very useful for.\n\n37\n00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.500\nA security person, anybody,\nliterally anybody, can read this book.\n\n38\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.350\n>> So really not geared towards\nany one person or one field.\n\n39\n00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.820\nThis is something that somebody that has\na little experience can pick up and enjoy.\n\n40\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.720\nAs well as somebody that had never\nlooked at cryptography before,\n\n41\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.710\ncould pick up this book and\nreally enjoy it and\n\n42\n00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.500\nget a good understanding of that basic\nfoundation of knowledge on cryptography.\n\n43\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.210\n>> Exactly.\n\n44\n00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.210\n>> Fantastic.\n\n45\n00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.080\n>> And from what I've heard from people\nat Reddit, that's been the result, so\n\n46\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.110\nI'm pretty happy about it.\n\n47\n00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.220\nAnd I think it's just something that\ncan make a complex topic accessible.\n\n48\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.720\nIt's actually in the form of,\nin some ways, almost like a puzzle book,\n\n49\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.110\nso it can be fun.\n\n50\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.980\n>> All right, so looking forward to it,\nlooking forward to it.\n\n51\n00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.990\nSo what kinda things are we gonna talk\nabout over the next week here in our show?\n\n52\n00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.920\n>> Over the next week we\nare gonna talk about all different\n\n53\n00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.120\naspects in cryptography.\n\n54\n00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.470\nWe'll talk some about the history\nof cryptography, we'll talk about\n\n55\n00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.360\nterminology, we will talk about classic\ncryptography in the term of symmetric.\n\n56\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.360\nWe'll move to modern,\nasymmetric cryptography examples, hashing,\n\n57\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.030\nsteganography.\n\n58\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.690\nWe'll talk about applications of it, and\n\n59\n00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.980\nthen we'll end stuff off with what\nthe future of cryptography looks like.\n\n60\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.740\nWhen we get into some stuff that may\nbe kind of abstract in the form of\n\n61\n00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.712\nquantum cryptography, and\nthat means quantum physics, so.\n\n62\n00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:14.702\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So I'm giving you a chance to study and\n\n63\n00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:16.650\nre-up on stuff, but\nit's some exciting stuff.\n\n64\n00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.830\n>> The whole spectrum of things\nwe're gonna see in here.\n\n65\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.680\n>> Fantastic.\n\n66\n00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.227\nFantastic.\nWell, I hope everybody out there is as\n\n67\n00:03:23.227 --> 00:03:26.570\nexcited as I am to get started\nin the world of cryptography, so\n\n68\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.230\nmake sure you tune in and\ncheck out our episodes.\n\n69\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.849\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
