Thank you very much.\n\n12\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.460\nAnd for you students out there,\none of the reasons why\n\n13\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.380\nI decided that this would be a great\nidea to work on putting this together,\n\n14\n00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.240\nis I looked at the materials that you\nhad available to you from Cyber Patriot.\n\n15\n00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.900\nThere were a whole series of slides,\nand we're going to use those slides so\n\n16\n00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.380\nthat we can present the materials in\na fashion that I think will be much\n\n17\n00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.310\neasier for you to absorb.\n\n18\n00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.450\nAnd I really want to thank ITProTV for\nallowing me to come here and to provide\n\n19\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.750\nyou with these materials because I think\nit'll really benefit you as students.\n\n20\n00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.880\nSo why don't we go over to\nthe slides that I prepared?\n\n21\n00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.280\nNow, that's just basically\nthe introductory slide.\n\n22\n00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.300\nBut as we go through it, I want to comment\nrelative to what I call resource partners.\n\n23\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.513\nAnd they're a bunch of entities that\nhelped put this project together.\n\n24\n00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:20.986\nObviously one of them is ITPROTV, but\nwe also have the CYBERPATRIOT program,\n\n25\n00:01:20.986 --> 00:01:22.817\nwe're using their materials,\n\n26\n00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:26.636\nyou're benefiting from what this\ngroup of individuals has done.\n\n27\n00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:29.697\nThey're sponsored by\nthe airforce association,\n\n28\n00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:34.108\nNorth of is a key sponsor associated\nwith them, we have NDG here,\n\n29\n00:01:34.108 --> 00:01:38.875\nNDG has a course that you're going to be\nable to have free access to The will teach\n\n30\n00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:42.030\nyou Linux principles and\nI think it's really good.\n\n31\n00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.950\nThere is incidentally with ITProTV,\nyou're also going to have access to\n\n32\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.870\na free IT fundamentals course, which we go\nthrough a little bit of networking here,\n\n33\n00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.220\nbut we can't cover it all.\n\n34\n00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.920\nSo you're gonna have access to that.\n\n35\n00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.080\nWe got the Cisco Network Academy\nthat's providing you\n\n36\n00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.930\naccess to their net academy program And\nthere are a whole\n\n37\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.565\nbunch of modules that your coach\nis going to have you go through.\n\n38\n00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:05.890\nThere.s Cyber Watch West,\n\n39\n00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.040\nthat's a academic centre of\nexcellence based out of Washington.\n\n40\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.025\nThey are a key participant.\n\n41\n00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:17.440\nWe;ve got My College Sierra College\nit's obviously a key participant and\n\n42\n00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.210\nthe North by North Regional Consortium\nmy college is a member of that.\n\n43\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.670\nThey've supported this effort.\n\n44\n00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.150\nAnd I really want to thank the California\nCommunity College Chancellor's Office that\n\n45\n00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.620\nhas provided funding for\n\n46\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.190\nthis particular effort under\ntheir doing what matters program.\n\n47\n00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.685\nSo these are all key resource-\n&gt;&gt; Looks like a lot of people really\n\n48\n00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:38.725\ncare and are putting forth efforts to go\nahead and make this initiative happen.\n\n49\n00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.295\nAnd Steven I do appreciate\nyou thanking ITProTV.\n\n50\n00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:45.486\nBut we'd like to thank you as well, and\nthank all of the adults and participants,\n\n51\n00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:47.870\nthe new students, as well, for doing this.\n\n52\n00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.540\nBecause it's such a great opportunity to\nreally set you up for a better lifestyle.\n\n53\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.230\n&gt;&gt; And the reason it's going to set\nyou up for a better lifestyle is,\n\n54\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.120\nif you prefer to go down this career path.\n\n55\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.280\nAs you go through here and\nyou learn cybersecurity.\n\n56\n00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.810\nIf you think, boy,\nthis would be fun to do as a job.\n\n57\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.780\nI want to show you this next slide,\nbecause I think it's really important.\n\n58\n00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.860\nThis is a recent slide shot,\na screen shot.\n\n59\n00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.380\nOf the CyberSeek site.\n\n60\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.470\nYou can go to it, it's at cyberseek.org.\n\n61\n00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.460\nIt was funded by NIST,\n\n62\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.000\nwhich is the National Institute of,\nwhat is it, Standards and Technology.\n\n63\n00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.500\n&gt;&gt; Technology.\n\n64\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sometimes I want to say-\n&gt;&gt; We have so many acronyms.\n\n65\n00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.645\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do.\n&gt;&gt; And you guys will find that out.\n\n66\n00:03:27.645 --> 00:03:28.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They do, and\n\n67\n00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.000\nif you look at this slide\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n68\n00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.420\nI pulled this last night\noff of the Internet.\n\n69\n00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.030\nIt indicates here in the lower\nleft hand corner that there\n\n70\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.150\nare currently in\nthe United States 348,975 jobs.\n\n71\n00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.840\n&gt;&gt; Overwhelming.\n\n72\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.450\n&gt;&gt; The workforce,\nthe totally employed workforce right now\n\n73\n00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.500\nis about three quarters of a million\n&gt;&gt; People, now slightly over that.\n\n74\n00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.270\nBut look at that.\n\n75\n00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.867\nall them are\n&gt;&gt; You see that huge deficit there.\n\n76\n00:03:55.867 --> 00:03:58.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThey're working all those 3 quarters of\n\n77\n00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.300\na million are working and yet\nwe have vacancies in 300,\n\n78\n00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.000\nin almost 350,000 positions,\nso there is a heck of\n\n79\n00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.110\nan opportunity here across the nation\nrelative to jobs out there.\n\n80\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.340\nAnd what we need,\nis we need people in those jobs.\n\n81\n00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.680\nAnd you're well equipped to get there.\n\n82\n00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.880\nYou go through the Cyber Patriot program,\n\n83\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.120\nperhaps go to a community\ncollege like Sierra,\n\n84\n00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.220\ngo through our training programs that are\ntied to industry driven certifications.\n\n85\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.780\nAnd that's funny with cybersecurity and\nwith a lot of IT,\n\n86\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.250\nthose industry driven certifications\nare of utmost importance.\n\n87\n00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.740\nThey prove to employers\nthat you know something.\n\n88\n00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.630\nThey prove to employers\nbecause to keep them,\n\n89\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.740\nyou've got to continue\ncontinuing education we call it.\n\n90\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.360\n&gt;&gt; Lifelong learners.\n\n91\n00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah lifelong learners.\n\n92\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.690\nAnd so it's really important that you go\nthrough and you achieve those objectives.\n\n93\n00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.110\nAnd what a great job this is.\n\n94\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.280\nThe key elements of it with regard\nto cybersecurity here, it's a bit of\n\n95\n00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.160\na challenge for companies and for\ngovernments to outsource cybersecurity.\n\n96\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.990\nBeyond the jurisdictional limits of\nthe courts of the United States.\n\n97\n00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.120\nThe FBI can't chase you in Eastern Europe\nvery well if you do something wrong,\n\n98\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.270\nso the employers are going to want to\nmake sure you're from this country and\n\n99\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.820\nyou're in this country\nas you do your work.\n\n100\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.670\nAnother great news about this job is\nbecause so much of what you do is remote,\n\n101\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.790\nmeaning you're going to remote into\nsystems, you don't necessarily\n\n102\n00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.170\nneed to be in an office building, your\ncompany's office building to do your work.\n\n103\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.565\nYou might be working from home,\nyou might be working from the beach.\n\n104\n00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:38.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There really are so many\nbenefits in working in IT, and personally\n\n105\n00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.270\n&gt;&gt; Personally,\n\n106\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.530\nI got into IT to really just\nbetter my family's life, and\n\n107\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.150\nthat's why I say it's possible for\nyou to do the same.\n\n108\n00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.130\nBecause I didn't have a cyber\npatriot program like this.\n\n109\n00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.070\nI really wish I did, because I am just so\n\n110\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.770\nimpressed with the amount of resources\nthat you guys have available to you.\n\n111\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.840\nAnd here's the thing.\n\n112\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.800\nEven if you already don't have\na really solid knowledge base,\n\n113\n00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.610\nthat's okay, because you have\na lot of tools at your disposal.\n\n114\n00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.120\nRight and a couple things I wanted\nto cover briefly back on the slides.\n\n115\n00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.450\nThe way that we've broken this out\ngenerally is at the beginning of\n\n116\n00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.280\neach unit and I believe there are ten\nunits, you'll have the opening slide.\n\n117\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.500\nFor example here it will identify\nUnit One with its heading.\n\n118\n00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.980\nWe will go through it and\nwe'll go through it and\n\n119\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.690\ndo the standard sort of\nlearning objectives.\n\n120\n00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.390\nThis is the way we teach today,\nwe identify the students\n\n121\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.470\nlearning objectives and then we'll go\nthrough and, so first here im telling you\n\n122\n00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.650\nwhat im going to teach you, then we'll go\nthrough the modules and I'll teach it.\n\n123\n00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.570\nAnd then ultimately I'll remind you as to\nwhat I've taught you, so that's kind of\n\n124\n00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.600\nthe pattern were going to use\n\n125\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.340\n&gt;&gt; 3 t's yea\n&gt;&gt; Yea\n\n126\n00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.120\n&gt;&gt; And so here is, for example,\n\n127\n00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.500\nsection one.\n\n128\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.160\nAnd at the end of each section, I mean,\nat the end of each unit we're going to\n\n129\n00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.330\ngo through and this is the final slide and\nthe purpose of this final slide is\n\n130\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.275\nI want this content to remain\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.998 --> 00:00:15.649\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, CyberPatriots,\nto your online training series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.918\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:23.624\nIn this particular episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at what cyber security is and how\n\n8\n00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:29.910\nthe CyberPatriot program is relevant and\napplicable in the field of cybersecurity.\n\n9\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.080\nWith us today, we have\nProfessor Steve Linthicum, thank you for\n\n10\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.230\nbeing with us today, Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.340\n&gt;&gt; Hi, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.070\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.040\nSo what are we gonna be\nlooking at in this episode?\n\n14\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.680\nWhat is cybersecurity?\n\n15\n00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.520\nAnd how do the CyberPatriots\nfit in to that equation?\n\n16\n00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.970\n&gt;&gt; Well, what I'm gonna do\nis show a series of slides.\n\n17\n00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.760\nThese slides were\nprovided by CyberPatriot.\n\n18\n00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.670\nAnd so I'm gonna go through them but\nI'm gonna embellish upon them so\n\n19\n00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.090\nthat you have a better understanding\nrather than just looking at the slides.\n\n20\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.440\nSo why don't we go to my screen,\nif we could bring that up.\n\n21\n00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.110\nAnd this is the unit,\nfirst unit in this segment.\n\n22\n00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.190\nThis is an introduction to\nthe CyberPatriot and cybersecurity.\n\n23\n00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.980\nAnd these are learning objectives, and for\nmiddle school and high school students,\n\n24\n00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.500\nthis is a common way that we would\npresent things in a college environment.\n\n25\n00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.960\nSo I'm glad to see that it's being brought\nto the middle schools and high schools.\n\n26\n00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.473\nI'm sure that you're seeing more and\n\n27\n00:01:24.473 --> 00:01:27.220\nmore of this where we have\noutlined learning objectives.\n\n28\n00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.595\nAnd our first objective\nhere is participants,\n\n29\n00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:34.800\nthat's you, will gain an understanding\nof the CyberPatriot competition.\n\n30\n00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.973\nWe're gonna do an overview, we're gonna\ntalk about the national competitions,\n\n31\n00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:43.399\nwe're gonna talk about team structures,\nwe're gonna look at scoring and timelines.\n\n32\n00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.228\nThen we're gonna move on to,\n\n33\n00:01:45.228 --> 00:01:49.765\nhopefully you gaining a broad\nunderstanding of what cybersecurity is and\n\n34\n00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:54.240\nwhy it's important in your everyday life,\nin the world and in careers.\n\n35\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.990\nAnd I'm gonna go on the Internet\non my screen here to\n\n36\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.593\nshow you a couple things that I\nthink bring it into perspective.\n\n37\n00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.170\nWe had an election recently, and\nthe focal point of the election\n\n38\n00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.660\nwas the voters of this country deciding\nwho would become the President.\n\n39\n00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.820\nAnd we all know the results of that,\nbecause it happened.\n\n40\n00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.340\nAnd there is a lot of talk out\nthere about the primary reason for\n\n41\n00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.340\nSecretary Clinton losing is\nher relationship with emails.\n\n42\n00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.020\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And a specific email server.\n\n43\n00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.113\nAnd this article here, the reason I bring\nit up is it suggests that the challenge\n\n44\n00:02:38.113 --> 00:02:43.900\nfor her may well have not been the fact\nthat she wasn't a cybersecurity expert.\n\n45\n00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.632\nThe challenge for her is she may\nhave been seeking the advice and\n\n46\n00:02:47.632 --> 00:02:52.704\ncounsel of people who she probably thought\nhad an understanding of cybersecurity but\n\n47\n00:02:52.704 --> 00:02:53.702\nreally did not.\n\n48\n00:02:53.702 --> 00:02:55.386\n&gt;&gt; And that's why it's so important.\n\n49\n00:02:55.386 --> 00:02:59.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it in essence probably\ncost her the election.\n\n50\n00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.420\nOr at least that's what some of the, what\nwe characterize as pundits are saying.\n\n51\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.680\nSo I wanted to go through here and\nshow you.\n\n52\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.630\nFirst of all, this article mentions\nthe gentleman whose pictures you can see.\n\n53\n00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.980\nI went on Facebook this morning.\n\n54\n00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.180\n&gt;&gt; Or LinkedIn?\n\n55\n00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.140\n&gt;&gt; Excuse me, LinkedIn, you're right.\n\n56\n00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.814\nI'm on LinkedIn, I should know that,\nand brought up this person's profile.\n\n57\n00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:29.150\nAnd as we go through their profile-\n&gt;&gt; Now, how did you assume that this was,\n\n58\n00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.800\nhow did you come to that conclusion\nthat this was, in fact, the employee for\n\n59\n00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.428\nthe Clinton.\n\n60\n00:03:35.428 --> 00:03:37.726\n&gt;&gt; Who was running her email server.\n\n61\n00:03:37.726 --> 00:03:39.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who was running her email server.\n\n62\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.512\n&gt;&gt; Well, because Internet searching,\nthat article that I had up on\n\n63\n00:03:44.512 --> 00:03:49.707\nthe screen just a moment ago\nidentified him as being the guy, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:51.818\n&gt;&gt; And so he just had a LinkedIn page?\n\n65\n00:03:51.818 --> 00:03:53.560\nYou were able to find him.\n&gt;&gt; He had a LinkedIn page.\n\n66\n00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n67\n00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.860\nas we go through it you can see\nthat he's got his experience here.\n\n68\n00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.670\nHe was a research director,\nwhatever that is, for the Garner Group.\n\n69\n00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.860\nHe was a special advisor\nto the Department of State.\n\n70\n00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.260\nAnd in the article they point to\nthe fact that he didn't work for\n\n71\n00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.000\nthe State Department at the same time\n\n72\n00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.030\nthat Hillary Clinton was\nthe Secretary of State.\n\n73\n00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.228\n&gt;&gt; So you're just finding this information\nout because it's public knowledge.\n\n74\n00:04:20.228 --> 00:04:20.806\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n75\n00:04:20.806 --> 00:04:22.610\n&gt;&gt; From a security standpoint,\n\n76\n00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.300\nanyone in the realm of security at that\nlevel, how do you feel this being,\n\n77\n00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.190\nthis type of personal information\nbeing out so accessible like this?\n\n78\n00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.340\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI wouldn't have a profile up if I were in\n\n79\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.850\na high position at the Secretary\nof State's office.\n\n80\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.690\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Relating to cybersecurity.\n\n81\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.540\nI would not do that.\n\n82\n00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.470\nBecause guess what, we're advertising\nwhat we do to the whole world.\n\n83\n00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.927\n&gt;&gt; And what our qualifications are or\nare not, right?\n\n84\n00:04:48.927 --> 00:04:54.930\n&gt;&gt; Right, and as we go down through here\nwe can see that he's worked for a while.\n\n85\n00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.808\nAnd we go down through and\na lot of people are recommending him,\n\n86\n00:04:57.808 --> 00:05:01.012\nalthough if you get to security you\ncan see that there's a line there,\n\n87\n00:05:01.012 --> 00:05:02.940\nthat there are people recommending him.\n\n88\n00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.025\nBut we get down here into education and\nexperience and\n\n89\n00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:11.396\ncertifications and\nthat's where it gets a bit sketchy.\n\n90\n00:05:11.396 --> 00:05:15.168\nHe has a Master's in\nBusiness Administration,\n\n91\n00:05:15.168 --> 00:05:18.300\nnot typically tied to security, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n93\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.720\n&gt;&gt; Although it does say something\nabout finance and technology.\n\n94\n00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.015\nI would suggest to you that\nthat's probably not a degree in\n\n95\n00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:27.299\ncybersecurity or IT.\n\n96\n00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:32.691\nHe had a job as the IT Director for\nHillary Clinton for President,\n\n97\n00:05:32.691 --> 00:05:38.768\nmeaning somebody might like me might\nsuggest to me that he was brought into\n\n98\n00:05:38.768 --> 00:05:46.001\nthe State Department as a favor because\nhis work relative to her campaigns.\n\n99\n00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:47.729\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now the Hillary for\n\n100\n00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.400\nPresident was after she left state.\n\n101\n00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.610\n&gt;&gt; Politics, go figure.\n\n102\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.290\n&gt;&gt; But political, right, tied to politics.\n\n103\n00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.599\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Has a little bit of experience here as\n\n104\n00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.302\nsomething called a Senior Systems\nEngineer, Systems Team Lead,\n\n105\n00:06:00.302 --> 00:06:01.901\nwhatever those terms mean.\n\n106\n00:06:01.901 --> 00:06:06.320\nI would imagine though that if this is\nhis first job you wouldn't be senior.\n\n107\n00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.120\nSomething a bit foreign about that.\n\n108\n00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.853\nBut we get down here-\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so\n\n109\n00:06:08.853 --> 00:06:11.130\nmaybe there's something\nthat's just not listed there.\n\n110\n00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.650\n&gt;&gt; And I'm looking and I'm looking and\nI'm looking and I'm looking for\n\n111\n00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.030\ncertifications and I don't see any.\n\n112\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.007\nThat doesn't mean he didn't have any,\nbecause the article that I brought\n\n113\n00:06:21.007 --> 00:06:25.668\nup first indicated that he had\na Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer\n\n114\n00:06:25.668 --> 00:06:29.701\ncertification in Windows NT 4.0 which is-\n&gt;&gt; Not really used too much in\n\n115\n00:06:29.701 --> 00:06:30.867\nthe business world these days.\n\n116\n00:06:30.867 --> 00:06:32.322\n&gt;&gt; And he also had one for 2000.\n\n117\n00:06:32.322 --> 00:06:36.986\nBut believe me if there are sites out\nthere, if there are networks out there\n\n118\n00:06:36.986 --> 00:06:42.259\nthat are running Windows NT and Windows\nServer 2000, they're not too secure.\n\n119\n00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.607\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because Microsoft quit supporting\n\n120\n00:06:44.607 --> 00:06:45.228\nthose-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n121\n00:06:45.228 --> 00:06:46.648\nwe came a long way since then, yeah.\n\n122\n00:06:46.648 --> 00:06:47.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n123\n00:06:47.945 --> 00:06:53.262\nSo, I say that, and let me first\nof all say that I'm not qualified\n\n124\n00:06:53.262 --> 00:06:57.728\nto sit in the role of running\na secure server like that.\n\n125\n00:06:57.728 --> 00:07:04.214\nAnd the reason I'm not in the position is,\nnot that eventually I couldn't be, but\n\n126\n00:07:04.214 --> 00:07:09.230\nwe're talking about nation\nstates attacking servers, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.278\n&gt;&gt; And they don't let up.\n\n128\n00:07:10.278 --> 00:07:13.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they don't let up, and of course\neverybody has been pointing to the fact\n\n129\n00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.470\nthat the likely attackers in this case\nwere probably the Russian government.\n\n130\n00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.410\nAnd so I don't feel qualified,\nas a matter of fact,\n\n131\n00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:26.250\nyou need an elite team to run an email\nserver for the Secretary of State.\n\n132\n00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.430\nElite in that they're experts,\n\n133\n00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.140\nred team members at every\ncybersecurity competition out there.\n\n134\n00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.615\nThose are the sort of people you would\nwant running this sort of server,\n\n135\n00:07:39.615 --> 00:07:41.812\nmaintaining its security.\n\n136\n00:07:41.812 --> 00:07:46.215\nAnd I'm qualified to\ndetermine I'm not qualified.\n\n137\n00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:48.563\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me just go through and\n\n138\n00:07:48.563 --> 00:07:51.073\non this slide, this is my profile.\n\n139\n00:07:51.073 --> 00:07:54.370\nAnd you students are welcome\nto go take a look at it.\n\n140\n00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.750\nAnd I have it out there, because first\nof all, I'm not in a secure job.\n\n141\n00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.900\nI'm a college professor.\n\n142\n00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.440\nI'm instructing you students, okay.\n\n143\n00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.415\n&gt;&gt; Which could potentially be\na hazard in putting your students at\n\n144\n00:08:05.415 --> 00:08:09.860\nrisk if you were attached to any\nkind of event, political event.\n\n145\n00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.130\n&gt;&gt; So we go through and\nI've got a couple degrees, and\n\n146\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.120\nthese are certifications,\nmost of which are industry-recognized.\n\n147\n00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.937\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n148\n00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:20.731\n&gt;&gt; And we can go down this whole list,\nand there are a bunch of Microsoft-\n\n149\n00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:21.670\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft, for sure.\n\n150\n00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.980\n&gt;&gt; I've been doing this a long time.\n\n151\n00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.970\nWe have some VMware certifications,\n\n152\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:31.015\nwe have a whole bunch of comp\nTS certifications, Citrix.\n\n153\n00:08:31.015 --> 00:08:32.594\n&gt;&gt; Nice list, yeah, I like it.\n\n154\n00:08:32.594 --> 00:08:36.352\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like to take tests, I guess.\n\n155\n00:08:36.352 --> 00:08:39.059\nThat's probably it.\n\n156\n00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:45.950\nSo I show you that, and\nthis is another article.\n\n157\n00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:51.680\nDocuments show Hillary's email\ntechnician was unqualified for the job.\n\n158\n00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.690\nOne of the things that you need to know,\nis that you need to know what you know and\n\n159\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:59.880\nwhat you potentially don't know,\nin this business of cybersecurity.\n\n160\n00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.530\nAnd I guess I'm pointing to this to point\nto the fact that as you go through and\n\n161\n00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.880\nlearn more and more and obtain more\ncertifications and become more of\n\n162\n00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.990\na expert, more of a professional in\ncybersecurity, a lot of things open up.\n\n163\n00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.357\nAnd a lot of job opportunities.\n\n164\n00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:22.179\nBut I really wanna encourage you to\nrecognize that this is a lifelong learning\n\n165\n00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:26.053\nopportunity and a great place\nto start is with CyberPatriot.\n\n166\n00:09:26.053 --> 00:09:30.858\nYou're gonna be working with teammates,\nyou're gonna be learning how to secure\n\n167\n00:09:30.858 --> 00:09:32.670\nan email server-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n168\n00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.650\n&gt;&gt; Potentially down the road, so\n\n169\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.770\nthat you can do a really good job.\n\n170\n00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:42.230\nSo that pretty much sums up what I\nwanted to open up this unit about,\n\n171\n00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.800\nis to let you know that you're\ngoing down the right pathway,\n\n172\n00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.030\nif ultimately this is\nthe career path you want.\n\n173\n00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:52.710\nBut between now and that career,\nhave fun and enjoy CyberPatriot.\n\n174\n00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:53.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great.\n\n175\n00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.660\nWell, thank you guys.\n\n176\n00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.110\nLike Steve said,\nlet's go ahead and stay tuned.\n\n177\n00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.450\nThere's a lot to learn in these\nepisodes that we have coming your way.\n\n178\n00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.635\nSo thank you guys so much for joining us.\n\n179\n00:10:04.635 --> 00:10:07.410\nDon't go anywhere, get comfortable.\n\n180\n00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.730\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n181\n00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.070\n&gt;&gt;

Welcome to the online\nCyberPatriot training series.\n\n4\n00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.750\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose,\nand today we're gonna be\n\n5\n00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.576\ntaking a look at the actual CyberPatriot\ncompetition, pretty cool stuff here.\n\n6\n00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:28.692\nWe have Professor Steve Linthicum to\nactually go through the details and\n\n7\n00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:32.480\nexplain how we can get started in\nthe actual competition process.\n\n8\n00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.187\nThank you for being here today, Steve.\n\n9\n00:00:34.187 --> 00:00:35.660\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n10\n00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.490\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna go through a series of slides.\n\n11\n00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.342\nI'll try to go through as quickly as\npossible because they're not exactly\n\n12\n00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:45.292\nexciting, but they're gonna define-\n&gt;&gt; Sure they are.\n\n13\n00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:46.639\n&gt;&gt; Come on.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:48.891\n&gt;&gt; But what we're gonna do is we're gonna\n\n15\n00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:53.400\nexplain the competition, how it works,\nand so let's go through my screen.\n\n16\n00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.800\nWe brought up the slides.\n\n17\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.600\nThese slides incidentally as I\nmentioned in an earlier video\n\n18\n00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.310\nwere produced by the CyberPatriot program.\n\n19\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.760\nSo we'll give them full credit for them.\n\n20\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.970\nAnd what is CyberPatriot?\n\n21\n00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.840\nWell it's a series of programs,\nindependent programs,\n\n22\n00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.140\nthat relate to teaching elementary school,\nmiddle school and\n\n23\n00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.090\nhigh school students about cybersecurity.\n\n24\n00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.230\nSo one of the programs is the AFA Camp,\n\n25\n00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.030\nthe AFA stands for\nthe Air Force Association.\n\n26\n00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.460\nThey have developed a series of camps.\n\n27\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.990\nAs a matter of fact, at my college,\nat Sierra College, and\n\n28\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.630\ncolleges in the region we\nran eight camps this summer.\n\n29\n00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.691\nThey were three day camps,\nstudents participated, middle school and\n\n30\n00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:36.330\nhigh school students participated.\n\n31\n00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.800\nThey got the opportunity to come\non campus, and at the same time,\n\n32\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.020\nwe had our summer schedules going on.\n\n33\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.220\nSo they were interfacing with college\nstudents and introduced the community\n\n34\n00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.340\ncollege system to the students, and\nthey went through training that\n\n35\n00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.790\nwas basically introductory training\nrelative to CyberPatriot and the program.\n\n36\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.090\nSo they got to experience\ncompetition on Friday and\n\n37\n00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.864\nit really turned out\nto be a great program.\n\n38\n00:02:02.864 --> 00:02:06.550\nWe had about 25 students at\neach one of the summer camps.\n\n39\n00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.360\nGives you a couple hundred\nstudents that got to participate.\n\n40\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.400\nAnd fortunately I have grant funding\nthat allowed those camps to be free.\n\n41\n00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.500\nIt was really cool.\n\n42\n00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.652\n&gt;&gt; That is really nice.\n&gt;&gt; And a great opportunity for\n\n43\n00:02:18.652 --> 00:02:20.240\nthe students.\n\n44\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.220\nThey have an elementary school\ninitiative which is providing\n\n45\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.000\nelementary school teachers with\nCourseWare that teaches their students,\n\n46\n00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.080\ntheir elementary school students,\nhow to be safe on the Internet.\n\n47\n00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.825\nThe Internet is the wild west.\n\n48\n00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:35.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You bet it is.\n\n49\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.008\nThere's all kinds of\ncrazy stuff out there.\n\n50\n00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:39.070\n&gt;&gt; There's crazy, crazy stuff.\n\n51\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.602\nAnd a lot of stuff that we would not want\nstudents to get an opportunity to look at.\n\n52\n00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:45.138\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n53\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.530\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's what that initiative is all about.\n\n54\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.800\nAnd then we have the National\nYouth Cyber Defense Competition.\n\n55\n00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.080\nThat's gonna be the focal point of this\nunit is to describe that competition\n\n56\n00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.650\nto you and how it works.\n\n57\n00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.020\nFirst of all, I wanna explain in\na highlight here not hacker training,\n\n58\n00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.460\nand it is not hacker training.\n\n59\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.020\nWhat we're gonna be dealing\nwith is defending machines,\n\n60\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.110\ndefending systems and networks.\n\n61\n00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.660\n&gt;&gt; So not offensive behavior,\nwe're gonna be looking at that defensive\n\n62\n00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.130\nbehavior like hardening systems and\nso forth.\n\n63\n00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.710\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and the whole idea here is\nhow can we make learning fun for you.\n\n64\n00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.780\nAnd what this competition\nsort of scenario does for\n\n65\n00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.250\nyou is it gives you the opportunity.\n\n66\n00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.091\nI'm sure many of you like to\nplay baseball, perhaps soccer.\n\n67\n00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:37.520\nGames where you have teams.\n\n68\n00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.470\nAnd so this is what this is all about.\n\n69\n00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.270\nYou're gonna be grouped\nwith fellow students,\n\n70\n00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.140\ntypically somewhere between,\nI'd say four to six students.\n\n71\n00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.020\nAnd you're gonna be working as\na team competing against other teams\n\n72\n00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.290\nto identify vulnerabilities and\nfix them, that's that whole deal.\n\n73\n00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.268\n&gt;&gt; Okay so we have this concept of teams,\nwe wanna make it fun, but guess what,\n\n74\n00:04:00.268 --> 00:04:05.800\nyou're really setting you guys up for\nsuccess because in real life,\n\n75\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.770\nin my past experience,\nIT departments work together as a team.\n\n76\n00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n77\n00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.240\nWith strengths and weaknesses.\n\n78\n00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.000\nThere's so much that you need to know\nthat not everybody can know everything.\n\n79\n00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.578\nIs that kind of a safe way of saying it?\n\n80\n00:04:19.578 --> 00:04:22.538\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so you're gonna be a specialist.\n\n81\n00:04:22.538 --> 00:04:27.674\nAnd you're gonna have, typically on a team\nthe way that we like to structure it and\n\n82\n00:04:27.674 --> 00:04:30.876\nthe way CyberPatriot\nsuggests structuring it is,\n\n83\n00:04:30.876 --> 00:04:34.460\nyou're gonna be dealing with\nLinux operating systems.\n\n84\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.740\nYou're gonna be dealing with\nWindows operating systems.\n\n85\n00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.260\nSo a couple of team members\nwill be your Linux experts, and\n\n86\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.600\na couple will be your Windows experts.\n\n87\n00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.210\nAnd somebody will be a coder, somebody\nwho understands how to write scripts.\n\n88\n00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.080\nAnd somebody will be a researcher.\n\n89\n00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because so much of this is done.\n\n90\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.770\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou're trying to diversify your teams.\n\n91\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And keep them useful in that way.\n\n92\n00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.840\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nyou're gonna want people, students,\n\n93\n00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.670\nto have multiple jobs because you\nwanna have two Ubuntu experts.\n\n94\n00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.874\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so cross training, perhaps,\nfor backup if someone's missing.\n\n95\n00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:09.660\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n96\n00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n97\n00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.529\nwhat we're gonna be focusing on\nis teaching you technical skills.\n\n98\n00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.760\nWe're gonna,\nas I mentioned earlier, teamwork.\n\n99\n00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.160\nIt's all about teamwork,\nand critical thinking.\n\n100\n00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.760\nHow to figure things out,\nbecause you're gonna be stumped.\n\n101\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.090\nYou're gonna get through\nthe competition and\n\n102\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.970\nyou're not gonna have\nscored all the points.\n\n103\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.930\nAnd you're gonna wonder what\nin the heck have we missed?\n\n104\n00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.360\nAnd that's where critical thinking\nreally gets into the picture.\n\n105\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.130\nHow to work as a group, how to analyze,\n\n106\n00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.560\nhow to diagnose what the problem is\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n107\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.460\n&gt;&gt; And then research a solution.\n\n108\n00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.897\n&gt;&gt; Those symptoms, and\nthen implement the solution, yeah.\n\n109\n00:05:44.897 --> 00:05:48.948\n&gt;&gt; All right, okay, so and I mentions\nsome of this a little bit earlier,\n\n110\n00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:51.559\nthe teams consist of\ntwo to six competitors,\n\n111\n00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:56.229\nthe maximum number of students that can be\non a team is six, those are the rules And\n\n112\n00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.750\nthe minimum number is two because it\nwouldn't be a team if you only had one.\n\n113\n00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.420\nIt would be hard to imagine.\n\n114\n00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.810\nBut I don't ever recommend having a team\nof two because if one of you gets sick or\n\n115\n00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.790\ncan't attend [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Responsibility and risk there.\n\n116\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.800\nSo, my thinking is, if you can,\nthe more the merrier, right?\n\n117\n00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.320\nBecause that's just extra sets of eyes to\npoint out different points of views or\n\n118\n00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.300\ndifferent vulnerabilities.\n\n119\n00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.240\n&gt;&gt; Well, except for competition.\n\n120\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.671\nAnd that would be true if we didn't\nhave rules like capping the number of\n\n121\n00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:26.368\nparticipants.\n\n122\n00:06:26.368 --> 00:06:27.410\n&gt;&gt; For sure, yeah.\n\n123\n00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.870\nSo in this particular situation\nsix is our limit here, right.\n\n124\n00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd incidentally, during the competitions,\n\n125\n00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.650\nand we'll talk about\nwhat they're all about.\n\n126\n00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.435\nYou can only have five students\ncompeting on a team, so\n\n127\n00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:43.520\nthe sixth would be an alternate,\nso that's just the basic setup.\n\n128\n00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.180\nYou have a coach, and\na coach is typically your teacher.\n\n129\n00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.287\nOr it could be somebody\noutside of teaching that is\n\n130\n00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:55.595\na volunteer that wants to participate.\n\n131\n00:06:55.595 --> 00:07:00.383\nI jokingly said during a break that\nonce I retire I'll probably be a coach,\n\n132\n00:07:00.383 --> 00:07:04.420\na coach probably for multiple teams,\nbecause you can do that.\n\n133\n00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.822\nAnd many of our settings where we have for\n\n134\n00:07:07.822 --> 00:07:12.320\nexample as an after school activity\nwe have 25 students participating.\n\n135\n00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.100\nWe might have five teams of five and\na single coach, and\n\n136\n00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.670\nthat coach serves as a supervisory role.\n\n137\n00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.690\nOne of the things about being under\nthe age of 18 is you're not considered,\n\n138\n00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.510\nby the law, as an adult, and so\nyou need supervision in a school setting.\n\n139\n00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.950\nSo the coach needs to satisfy\nthe particular school,\n\n140\n00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.440\ntheir legal requirements\nassociated with supervising kids.\n\n141\n00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.790\n&gt;&gt; Sure, because that school would be\nheld liable if they were to access\n\n142\n00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.280\ninappropriate content.\n\n143\n00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.740\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n144\n00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.240\nYou can have an optional\ntechnical mentor and in an ideal\n\n145\n00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.150\nworld we would want that technical\nmentor to be the teacher of content.\n\n146\n00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.990\nThe teacher of cybersecurity content,\n\n147\n00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:02.170\nmuch the same as I'm gonna be doing in a\nnumber of the later lessons going through\n\n148\n00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.900\ntechniques in hardening and\na variety of things.\n\n149\n00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.900\nAnd the problem is truthfully,\n\n150\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.675\nand we'll talk about that in\na little bit more detail.\n\n151\n00:08:11.675 --> 00:08:16.194\nCybersecurity professionals are so busy\ntoday they don't have time to volunteer\n\n152\n00:08:16.194 --> 00:08:19.212\nand that's one of the purposes\nof this video session.\n\n153\n00:08:19.212 --> 00:08:23.813\nThese sessions is to provide some sort of\ntraining with a live human being rather\n\n154\n00:08:23.813 --> 00:08:28.416\nthan you having to read through all this\nmaterial that can help you to understand\n\n155\n00:08:28.416 --> 00:08:29.860\nit as students.\n\n156\n00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.190\nSo teams compete online\nin qualifying rounds.\n\n157\n00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.037\nThere are a series of rounds.\n\n158\n00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:39.878\nWe'll go through all that as I proceed and\nI need to speed this up a bit.\n\n159\n00:08:39.878 --> 00:08:42.803\nAnd points are earned by identifying and\n\n160\n00:08:42.803 --> 00:08:47.650\ncorrecting weaknesses in\nsimulated computer systems.\n\n161\n00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.135\nSo ultimately what happens\nis that successful teams,\n\n162\n00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:56.148\nthe most successful teams, end up going\nback to Washington D.C. each year.\n\n163\n00:08:56.148 --> 00:08:58.586\n&gt;&gt; I saw that.\nThis looks pretty cool, I wanna go.\n\n164\n00:08:58.586 --> 00:08:59.933\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n165\n00:08:59.933 --> 00:09:01.716\n&gt;&gt; And all expenses paid,\n\n166\n00:09:01.716 --> 00:09:06.621\nthey go back to Washington D.C.\nfor the final competitions that\n\n167\n00:09:06.621 --> 00:09:11.370\ntake place in either March or\nApril, depending upon the year.\n\n168\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.380\nThis year, it's April.\n\n169\n00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.070\nLast year, it was in March.\n\n170\n00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.017\nAnd so, we have these coaches, as I\nmentioned earlier, typically teachers.\n\n171\n00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:23.437\nTechnical mentors, these are the\ncybersecurity professionals that come in\n\n172\n00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:27.150\nand they talk to you and\nexplain cybersecurity techniques.\n\n173\n00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.090\nWe have something called team assistance.\n\n174\n00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.275\nThese are not so much technical support,\nalthough in my environment and\n\n175\n00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:38.174\nin my region, we're using community\ncollege students to fit this role.\n\n176\n00:09:38.174 --> 00:09:40.079\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n177\n00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:44.481\n&gt;&gt; They will have some knowledge because\nthey're going through our cybersecurity\n\n178\n00:09:44.481 --> 00:09:47.660\nclasses, but\nthey're not in the business at this point.\n\n179\n00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n180\n00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.530\n&gt;&gt; And part of the reason for that is\nbecause this sort of volunteer activity, I\n\n181\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.700\nkind of scrolled through it on my profile\non a earlier video, my LinkedIn profile.\n\n182\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.710\nBut there's an area there were you can\nput in volunteer work that you're doing.\n\n183\n00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.860\nAnd as your building your resume,\nmy students at the community college\n\n184\n00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.380\nare building their resume,\nthis is a good resume item.\n\n185\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.060\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Cybersecurity that you worked as a team\n\n186\n00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.755\nassistant, and then competitors,\nwell, that's you students.\n\n187\n00:10:14.755 --> 00:10:20.840\nYou're competing against other teams\nfrom throughout the United States, okay.\n\n188\n00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.530\nSo you earn points by fixing things,\n\n189\n00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:28.080\nyou lose points by fixing wrong things and\nmessing up the system.\n\n190\n00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.500\nSo for example you could gain points by\n\n191\n00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.620\nmaking sure all the users had passwords,\nbecause users should have passwords.\n\n192\n00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.120\nAnd you could lose points by, for example,\n\n193\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.680\nremoving a user that's\nsupposed to still be there.\n\n194\n00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.090\nSo that gives you some examples.\n\n195\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.512\nNot all vulnerabilities are scored,\nthere's a scoring engine.\n\n196\n00:10:49.512 --> 00:10:52.080\nYou're gonna hear sounds\nwhen you do a good thing.\n\n197\n00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.424\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And you're going to hear not so\n\n198\n00:10:53.424 --> 00:10:55.830\ngood sounds when you do a bad thing.\n\n199\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.970\nBut they're scored,\nthere's a scoring engine and\n\n200\n00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.070\nwhat happens is on your machine,\nyour computer,\n\n201\n00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:07.200\nyour virtual machine,\nyou can view your scores as they change.\n\n202\n00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.900\nHopefully improving all the time, okay.\n\n203\n00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:16.630\nAnd so basically the way the competitions\nwork, they're six hours in duration.\n\n204\n00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.737\nWhich is a bit challenging, where do\nyou fit six hours in a middle school or\n\n205\n00:11:20.737 --> 00:11:23.290\na high school student's time frame.\n\n206\n00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:23.850\nAnd guess what?\n\n207\n00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.815\nThat's what weekends are for.\n\n208\n00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:29.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The competing days are Sunday, I mean,\n\n209\n00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.420\nFriday, Saturday, and Sunday.\n\n210\n00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.390\nA particular weekend is picked out.\n\n211\n00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.500\nAnd you don't get to pick that.\n\n212\n00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.025\nCybersecurity\n&gt;&gt; They choose the dates?\n\n213\n00:11:37.025 --> 00:11:38.560\n&gt;&gt; CyberPatriot determines the dates.\n\n214\n00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n215\n00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.155\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n216\n00:11:40.155 --> 00:11:45.320\nSo what happens is that\nyour coach gets an image.\n\n217\n00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:51.430\nThat image is loaded on computers at\nyour location where you're competing.\n\n218\n00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.420\nAnd that might be at the school site,\n\n219\n00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.300\nit might be at a community college site,\nit could be at Starbucks,\n\n220\n00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.500\nit could be wherever you can get enough\nmachines together in with internet access.\n\n221\n00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.610\nAnd then the competition starts,\nit ends after six hours.\n\n222\n00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.540\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying is these\nlocations, your teams are gonna be\n\n223\n00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.520\ncompeting essentially in real time against\neach other during that six hour window?\n\n224\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.390\n&gt;&gt; They're competing against\nthe other team's scores.\n\n225\n00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.318\nDoes that make sense?\n\n226\n00:12:19.318 --> 00:12:20.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n227\n00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:25.520\n&gt;&gt; And so ultimately scores are how\nmany vulnerabilities you fix.\n\n228\n00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That are scored.\n\n229\n00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.660\nAnd how long it takes you to do that,\nokay.\n\n230\n00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n231\n00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:36.597\n&gt;&gt; So ultimately, if let's say\nthe maximum points are 200 for\n\n232\n00:12:36.597 --> 00:12:41.552\na particular virtual machine,\nthen if you get all 200.\n\n233\n00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:42.655\n&gt;&gt; It would go down to time.\n\n234\n00:12:42.655 --> 00:12:43.840\n&gt;&gt; And then it would go down to time.\n\n235\n00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.953\n&gt;&gt; Nice, okay.\n&gt;&gt; And you're competing with all of\n\n236\n00:12:45.953 --> 00:12:47.830\nthe teams across the nation.\n\n237\n00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.650\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n238\n00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And how many teams normally participate\n\n239\n00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.520\nin this event?\n\n240\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.435\n&gt;&gt; This year it's over 3,000 teams.\n\n241\n00:12:54.435 --> 00:12:55.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n242\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.310\nLots of teams from everywhere.\n\n243\n00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.350\n&gt;&gt; Pretty awesome.\n\n244\n00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n245\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.940\nSo this gives you the slide and\nI'm not sure you can read it very well.\n\n246\n00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:07.130\nBut it gives you the timeframe You can\nenter this at just about any time but\n\n247\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:11.320\nthe best way to enter the competition for\nteams is to start in April.\n\n248\n00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.354\nThat's when the exhibition rounds start.\n\n249\n00:13:14.354 --> 00:13:19.332\n[CROSSTALK] And they're scored but\nthese are all practice rounds and\n\n250\n00:13:19.332 --> 00:13:25.540\nthey proceed through the summer and then\nthe official practice round is in October.\n\n251\n00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.236\nAnd to give you some idea in my region,\nI hosted the practice round for\n\n252\n00:13:29.236 --> 00:13:33.090\nany teams that wanted to come to\nSierra College and participate.\n\n253\n00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.214\nIt cost me $605 in pizza, okay.\n\n254\n00:13:36.214 --> 00:13:38.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we did it on Saturday.\n\n255\n00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.080\nWe started at ten, and we ended at three.\n\n256\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.460\nAnd everybody had a great time.\n\n257\n00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.880\nI had,\nI think it was about 200 students there.\n\n258\n00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.483\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n259\n00:13:46.483 --> 00:13:50.870\n&gt;&gt; And it was,\nwhat a great opportunity for the students.\n\n260\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.490\nBecause there's this\ninteraction in the same rooms.\n\n261\n00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.355\nWe use the whole bottom floor\nof our technology building.\n\n262\n00:13:56.355 --> 00:13:59.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; With six classrooms with computers\n\n263\n00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.700\nalready in them.\n\n264\n00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.720\nAnd it was a great thing, and then we\nhave our rounds, our competition rounds.\n\n265\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.297\nThere's round one in November, round\ntwo in December, and teams are ranked.\n\n266\n00:14:10.297 --> 00:14:14.258\nWhat we try to do is rank them,\nwe have a platinum division,\n\n267\n00:14:14.258 --> 00:14:18.000\nwe have a gold division, and\nwe have a silver division.\n\n268\n00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.380\n&gt;&gt; Are they separated by age in any way?\n\n269\n00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:27.597\n&gt;&gt; Well, they're separated by age in\nterms of, we have those three levels.\n\n270\n00:14:27.597 --> 00:14:28.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n271\n00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.525\n&gt;&gt; But we have a middle school division.\n\n272\n00:14:30.525 --> 00:14:31.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n273\n00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.850\n&gt;&gt; And so all middle school students\nare competing against other middle school\n\n274\n00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.270\nstudents and their teams.\n\n275\n00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:43.250\nWe have a all-services division which\nis made up of JROTC, junior ROTC.\n\n276\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.180\nMilitary types, or civil air patrol.\n\n277\n00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.460\nAnd then we have the open\nhigh school division,\n\n278\n00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.630\nwhich is composed of high school students.\n\n279\n00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.280\n&gt;&gt; So there are winners selected\nin each one of these categories?\n\n280\n00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:52.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n281\n00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.751\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and as you can see,\n\n282\n00:14:54.751 --> 00:14:58.801\nwhat happens here is that\nultimately we have state rounds,\n\n283\n00:14:58.801 --> 00:15:01.885\nwe have regional rounds and\nthen the finals.\n\n284\n00:15:01.885 --> 00:15:07.605\nAnd the finals this year actually took\nplace, or last April, they took place.\n\n285\n00:15:07.605 --> 00:15:11.960\nThis is two years ago, the competition\nline, and then it all starts up again.\n\n286\n00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.025\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n287\n00:15:13.025 --> 00:15:18.230\nSo we're actually trying\nto achieve this this prize,\n\n288\n00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.500\nand the prize is, number one,\ntrip to Washington.\n\n289\n00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.280\nNumber two,\nthe visibility of your area of expertise.\n\n290\n00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.410\nYou guys have been working hard at this,\nor at least this is the beginning,\n\n291\n00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:29.900\nyou will be, right.\n\n292\n00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.730\nAnd you might get some media\ncoverage from that, some exposure.\n\n293\n00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:38.490\nAnd then there could possibly be some\npotential scholarships as well right.\n\n294\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.080\n&gt;&gt; Well Northrop Grumman\nsponsors this program.\n\n295\n00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.836\nAnd they provide scholarships to students.\n\n296\n00:15:42.836 --> 00:15:48.797\nThey're also there as kind of scouts\nlooking for their future employees,\n\n297\n00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:53.906\nand they hire a lot of high school\nstudents who participate, and\n\n298\n00:15:53.906 --> 00:15:59.603\nmiddle school students who achieve\nthat final category recognition.\n\n299\n00:15:59.603 --> 00:16:00.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n300\n00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.829\n&gt;&gt; There at the finals.\n\n301\n00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.010\nSo it's a great opportunity for students.\n\n302\n00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.080\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm excited Steve.\n\n303\n00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.260\nSo now that we know a little bit\nabout how this competition works,\n\n304\n00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.310\nwe can go ahead and\ncontinue with our training so\n\n305\n00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:18.040\nthat we can be more efficient at actually\nachieving those ultimate prizes there.\n\n306\n00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.950\nSo thank you guys so much for\ntuning in today, but don't go anywhere,\n\n307\n00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.380\nwe have some more shows coming your way.\n\n308\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.430\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n309\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:27.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Steve Linthicum.\n\n310\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.539\n&gt;&gt; Signing off, see you next time.\n\n311\n00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:36.740\n[MUSIC]\n\n312\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.828\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:16.100\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, CyberPatriots,\nto another exciting episode.\n\n5\n00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.630\nIn this episode, we're gonna be looking\nat an introduction to cybersecurity.\n\n6\n00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.750\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.260\nAnd with us, to go ahead and\n\n8\n00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.740\nexplain cybersecurity,\nwe have professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n9\n00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.560\nThank you for being here today, Steve.\n\n10\n00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.440\n&gt;&gt; Hi, it's good to be back.\n\n11\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.030\nWe're gonna go through here and I'm gonna\nprovide an introduction to cybersecurity.\n\n12\n00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.904\nAnd I'm sure for some of you,\nyou already know most of this stuff, but\n\n13\n00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:41.134\nlet's work through it and see how we do.\n\n14\n00:00:41.134 --> 00:00:43.110\nSo we'll bring up my screen, and\n\n15\n00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.460\nyou can see we have the introductory slide\nthat's part of the CyberPatriot materials\n\n16\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.140\nthat are provided to you by\nthe CyberPatriot organization.\n\n17\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.950\nAnd basically, the question here that's\npresented is, what is cybersecurity?\n\n18\n00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.260\nWell, this is a pretty good definition.\n\n19\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.251\nAll the tools we use, and actions we\ntake to keep computers, networks and\n\n20\n00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:09.163\ninformation safe and available for\nthose who need it and unavailable for\n\n21\n00:01:09.163 --> 00:01:12.731\nthose who we obviously do\nnot want to have it, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:18.311\nSo what's hidden in here, and\nyou're gonna see this message throughout\n\n23\n00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:23.830\nthe presentations that I'll be doing,\nis the idea of what CIA is.\n\n24\n00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.455\nAnd you might think that CIA is that\norganization where we don't know what its\n\n25\n00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:29.369\nbudget is, we have no idea what it does.\n\n26\n00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.703\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The intelligence community?\n\n27\n00:01:30.703 --> 00:01:33.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, the intelligence community.\n\n28\n00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.090\nWell, for whatever reason,\n\n29\n00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.500\nthat acronym means something different\nwhen we're talking about cybersecurity.\n\n30\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.820\nThe C is for confidentiality,\nand the I is for integrity.\n\n31\n00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.340\nBut let me, and\nthat's kind of a tough one to understand.\n\n32\n00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.000\nIntegrity talks about what we're\nviewing for example, data.\n\n33\n00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.860\nThat it hasn't changed.\n\n34\n00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.190\nThat it is what it is expected to be.\n\n35\n00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.050\nThat nobody has gone through and\nmodified it without us knowing about it.\n\n36\n00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.340\n&gt;&gt; So Steve, what you're saying, for\n\n37\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.790\nthe confidentiality part,\nthat is a moral stance.\n\n38\n00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.060\nWhereas integrity, we're actually\nverifying the originality or\n\n39\n00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.100\nthe authenticity of the data\nversus it being a moral integrity.\n\n40\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n41\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.010\nAnd then we have availability.\n\n42\n00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.040\nAnd I always struggle with availability.\n\n43\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.910\nIt just doesn't quite seem to fit, but\n\n44\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.040\nit really does as we go through and\nexplain it.\n\n45\n00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.452\nAnd that means that information that\nyou need access to is available so\n\n46\n00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:33.960\nthat you can access it.\n\n47\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.627\nWe've seen over recent history where\nthat's become a real problem on\n\n48\n00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:43.611\nthe internet with what are called\nDistributed Denial of Service Attacks,\n\n49\n00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:44.650\nDDOS attacks.\n\n50\n00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.250\nAnd this is where you can't get to,\nfor example, Amazon.\n\n51\n00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.380\nLet's say you wanted to buy something\non Amazon and so you type in the URL,\n\n52\n00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.930\nthe uniform resource locator or\nlocation, and you can't get to the site.\n\n53\n00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.547\nWell, that-\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like what happened after that\n\n54\n00:03:03.547 --> 00:03:07.236\nelection you had mentioned for\nthe [LAUGH] the Canadian website.\n\n55\n00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:09.386\nI heard that that crashed\nafter the election for\n\n56\n00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:11.330\npeople saving, that they wanted to move.\n\n57\n00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.930\nSo that would be an example of a friendly\ndistributed denial of service,\n\n58\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.845\nbecause it was a legitimate\ndenial of service.\n\n59\n00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:18.940\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But you did say that A is kind of\n\n60\n00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.449\na weird one, because not having these\nresources available will actually be,\n\n61\n00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.120\nit could be a security breach.\n\n62\n00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.231\nIf someone, an attacker, were to\nphysically cut your power, you don't have\n\n63\n00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:34.486\nany available power, that could cause\nserious problems for a lot of companies.\n\n64\n00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:36.270\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n&gt;&gt; So definitely something to think about.\n\n65\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that's absolutely correct.\n\n66\n00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.990\nSo basically, down below in\nthe lower part of this slide,\n\n67\n00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.570\nthey talk about that means\nthat protecting hardware and\n\n68\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.320\ndata from from everything from\nhacktivist to earthquakes.\n\n69\n00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.369\nSo it's really even broader\nwhen we think about it.\n\n70\n00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:53.780\nSo I'm from California.\n\n71\n00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.636\nWe're familiar with earthquakes.\n\n72\n00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:56.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You may not be.\n\n73\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.808\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're familiar with\nhurricanes here in Florida.\n\n74\n00:03:58.808 --> 00:03:59.537\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n75\n00:03:59.537 --> 00:04:06.090\nthe issue relative to this sort of thing\nis do we have a system that is robust.\n\n76\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.470\nMeaning that it stays around,\nit's available.\n\n77\n00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.370\nIt's available.\n\n78\n00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.743\nAnd oftentimes [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; You hear that term high\n\n79\n00:04:11.743 --> 00:04:13.170\navailability a lot.\n\n80\n00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.970\n&gt;&gt; Right, and oftentimes the way that we\n\n81\n00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.270\nmanage to have that capability is through\nfall tolerance, through redundancy.\n\n82\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.797\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Best way to illustrate it is your\n\n83\n00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:26.464\ncomputer at home has\na single power supply, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:26.464 --> 00:04:27.437\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n85\n00:04:27.437 --> 00:04:30.636\nWell that's great except what\nhappens when the power goes out?\n\n86\n00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:31.602\nYou got a problem, right?\n\n87\n00:04:31.602 --> 00:04:33.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; Unless it's a laptop, and\n\n88\n00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.430\nthen it doesn't go out because\nyou have a battery in there.\n\n89\n00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.030\n&gt;&gt; But if you're using a router or\nnetworking equipment, you're not gonna\n\n90\n00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.530\nhave any Internet accessibility or able to\nuse that gateway, if your power does go.\n\n91\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.218\nYou have your laptop, and\nstill might be able to work offline, but\n\n92\n00:04:49.218 --> 00:04:52.242\nthose are all things you have to think\nabout, even at that hardware level,\n\n93\n00:04:52.242 --> 00:04:53.456\nlike with your power supply.\n\n94\n00:04:53.456 --> 00:04:54.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n95\n00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.720\nAnd that's why at home,\neverybody recommends, and\n\n96\n00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.390\nit probably makes sense, that you have\nsome sort of a backup power supply.\n\n97\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.800\nIt will protect your machines and\n\n98\n00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.719\nthey won't shut down immediately,\nwhich can be a real challenge.\n\n99\n00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.639\nSo we need to be concerned about\nthose kinds of things with regard to\n\n100\n00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.200\nsecurity also.\n\n101\n00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.219\nSo it's not just keeping things secret.\n\n102\n00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:18.642\n&gt;&gt; Right, availability also.\n\n103\n00:05:18.642 --> 00:05:23.195\nThose three fundamentals there,\nconfidentiality, integrity and\n\n104\n00:05:23.195 --> 00:05:24.520\navailability.\n\n105\n00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.830\nAnd just about everything kinda falls into\none or more of those three fundamentals.\n\n106\n00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You can categorize them as such.\n\n107\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.078\n&gt;&gt; So you'll be hearing us mention\nthat more and more and more,\n\n108\n00:05:34.078 --> 00:05:35.235\nbeating it into your heads.\n\n109\n00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:37.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] More than you probably want\nto hear, is what he's saying, yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:37.688 --> 00:05:39.478\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n111\n00:05:39.478 --> 00:05:40.304\nSo let's move on.\n\n112\n00:05:40.304 --> 00:05:41.731\nSo, why is security important?\n\n113\n00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:43.750\nWell, duh.\n\n114\n00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.340\nI mean what can I say?\n\n115\n00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.890\nWe rely upon information\nresources all the time,\n\n116\n00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.533\nand you're using probably\nevery one of this.\n\n117\n00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:57.102\nBanks, got a bank?\n\n118\n00:05:57.102 --> 00:06:01.260\nI haven't been to a bank,\ninside a bank in a long time.\n\n119\n00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.780\nI do all my banking online.\n\n120\n00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.790\nIt's just what I do.\n\n121\n00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.200\nSocial media.\n\n122\n00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.460\n&gt;&gt; Guilty [LAUGH].\n\n123\n00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.310\n&gt;&gt; Schools, guilty obviously,\nmy employer, airlines and railroads.\n\n124\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.330\n&gt;&gt; This is a huge one.\n\n125\n00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n126\n00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.730\n&gt;&gt; A lot of transportation\nrelying on that, and\n\n127\n00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.230\ncould you think the chaos that would ensue\nif one of these systems were compromised?\n\n128\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, and we see that oftentimes with\nairlines, where their systems go down.\n\n129\n00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.160\nI know there has been a recent one\nwith Southwest Airlines, for example.\n\n130\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.698\nAnd it probably doesn't matter when you\nview this, there has been a recent event\n\n131\n00:06:32.698 --> 00:06:35.781\nwith an airline where their airplanes\nare stacked up and they can't-\n\n132\n00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:37.161\n&gt;&gt; They're happening all the time, yeah.\n\n133\n00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:40.316\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so stores.\n\n134\n00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:44.910\nTry to go into a grocery store and\nbuy something when the power's out.\n\n135\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.140\nThey just lock the doors these\ndays because everything that's\n\n136\n00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.430\nused to check you out is computer-based.\n\n137\n00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.960\n&gt;&gt; All their point of sale machines,\ntheir cashiers.\n\n138\n00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.030\nYeah, they don't have a fail back\nhandwritten receipt mechanism anymore.\n\n139\n00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.340\n&gt;&gt; They wouldn't know what to do with it.\n\n140\n00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.678\nIt's hard enough to get\nthem to take real cash.\n\n141\n00:07:01.678 --> 00:07:03.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've got police and\n\n142\n00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.540\nfire departments, first responders.\n\n143\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.450\nThe equipment that they utilize\nto get notification that there is\n\n144\n00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.090\nan issue out there so\nthat they can get there quickly.\n\n145\n00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.240\nThat's all critical.\n\n146\n00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.670\nMilitary and governments systems.\n\n147\n00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.410\nAnd then we've got doctor's offices,\nhealthcare.\n\n148\n00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.827\nThere's a whole,\nwell there's a conversion going on and\n\n149\n00:07:23.827 --> 00:07:26.947\nit's a continuing conversion moving\nover to electronic health records.\n\n150\n00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:28.775\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Systems yeah?\n\n151\n00:07:28.775 --> 00:07:33.390\nAnd that's a critical area,\nparticularly in cybersecurity.\n\n152\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:38.160\nBecause the federal government has\nimposed rigid standards when security is\n\n153\n00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.820\nbreached that are costly to physicians,\n\n154\n00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.745\ncostly to hospitals,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n155\n00:07:42.745 --> 00:07:45.283\n&gt;&gt; So, security is a very-\n&gt;&gt; So, you have to think about that.\n\n156\n00:07:45.283 --> 00:07:47.752\nWe've got HIPAA for\nthe medical industry, and\n\n157\n00:07:47.752 --> 00:07:51.889\nthere are a lot of other regulatory bodies\nthat we have to comply with when we're\n\n158\n00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:54.747\nlooking at the security standpoint for\nour industry.\n\n159\n00:07:54.747 --> 00:07:59.493\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so, these slides, and\nI'm gonna go through them real\n\n160\n00:07:59.493 --> 00:08:03.912\nbriefly because we could update\nthem from last week almost.\n\n161\n00:08:03.912 --> 00:08:05.331\nWhy is cybersecurity important?\n\n162\n00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:12.270\nWell, it's a heavy, heavy costly burden\nif cybersecurity confidentiality,\n\n163\n00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:18.310\nintegrity, availability,\nif those components are not met.\n\n164\n00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.780\nI'll give you an example here in 2006,\nwhen Veterans Administration\n\n165\n00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.325\nperson who worked at the VA,\ntaking a laptop home that was stolen, and\n\n166\n00:08:27.325 --> 00:08:31.660\nits records were not\nencrypted on the hard drive.\n\n167\n00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.920\nThey had to go through a notification\nprocess that was costly.\n\n168\n00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.694\nWe've got Coca-Cola executives, one of\nthem clicked on a spoofed email, and\n\n169\n00:08:39.694 --> 00:08:42.843\nthat's all you have to do\nto open up a network today.\n\n170\n00:08:42.843 --> 00:08:46.910\nIs you get an email from\nsomebody you don't recognize, or\n\n171\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:52.141\nmaybe even recognize, and you click\non that attachment, and guess what?\n\n172\n00:08:52.141 --> 00:08:57.666\nIt's a piece of software that starts\nrunning on your computer effectively,\n\n173\n00:08:57.666 --> 00:09:01.916\nmaking your computer controlled\nby the outside world, and\n\n174\n00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:02.560\nthen-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n175\n00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.920\nwhen you download that attachment, you're\ndownloading an extra little surprise that\n\n176\n00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.480\nthat attacker might have sent you, right?\n\n177\n00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n178\n00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.780\n&gt;&gt; And employers, sometimes, and\n\n179\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.210\nuser training awareness is really\nthe best line of defense here.\n\n180\n00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.630\nNot clicking on those embedded hyperlinks,\nright?\n\n181\n00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.530\nGoing directly to that company if\nit says it's from your banking\n\n182\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.420\ninstitution that you're familiar with.\n\n183\n00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.130\nAnd there are even security companies\nout there that come in and perform tests\n\n184\n00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.390\nto see what person and do your employees\nare gonna click on that hyperlink.\n\n185\n00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.713\nYou can look at open DNS has an online\nphishing Scan Test and Sonic Wall, so\n\n186\n00:09:32.713 --> 00:09:35.311\nif you guys did a search, you'd find that.\n\n187\n00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:37.174\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Kinda to test your knowledge there,\n\n188\n00:09:37.174 --> 00:09:39.624\nto see how you rank now and\nthen, at the end of the program,\n\n189\n00:09:39.624 --> 00:09:41.800\nyou might wanna try back and\ntest it again.\n\n190\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nI love this next example on this slide.\n\n191\n00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.230\nAnd this is the Department\nof Homeland Security.\n\n192\n00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:52.380\nWhat they did was they planted outside\nof a government building a bunch of USB\n\n193\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.900\ndrives, and also CDs, this was somewhat\noutdated, when we were still using CDs.\n\n194\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.470\nAnd employees picked them up,\nwent into their office, or\n\n195\n00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.770\ntheir cubicle, and\nplugged them in, a real problem.\n\n196\n00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.450\n&gt;&gt; Another way of testing\nyour employees there.\n\n197\n00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.182\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And even a more recent,\n\n198\n00:10:10.182 --> 00:10:14.080\nyou would think Department of Homeland\nSecurity, they've got it together, right?\n\n199\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.310\nWell, all it takes is that one\nindividual to go ahead and\n\n200\n00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:21.770\nbring that malware into your system,\nor to leak that information.\n\n201\n00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.490\nActually, this pretty interesting.\n\n202\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:29.680\nOne of their helpdesk technicians\ngave a digital token to an attacker\n\n203\n00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.050\nwho had compromised an email account,\nwhich led to the attacker,\n\n204\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.310\ngave them unfiltered access to\none terabyte worth of storage.\n\n205\n00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:44.990\nIt was something ridiculous,\n20,000 FBI employee contact information,\n\n206\n00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:50.024\nand then 9,000 Department of\nHomeland Security contacts as well.\n\n207\n00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:53.065\nSo they, and\nthen the attacker uploaded it online.\n\n208\n00:10:53.065 --> 00:10:55.822\nAnd once that gets out there,\nthe retraction, I mean,\n\n209\n00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.415\nthere's no, it's out there.\n\n210\n00:10:57.415 --> 00:10:58.627\n&gt;&gt; Once it gets out there, it's out there.\n\n211\n00:10:58.627 --> 00:11:01.497\nYes, yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n212\n00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.120\n&gt;&gt; So, this next slide gives us\nan example of a back office malware\n\n213\n00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.210\nattack that took place in 2013.\n\n214\n00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.408\nIt continues to take place,\nthese do, these malware attacks.\n\n215\n00:11:12.408 --> 00:11:12.931\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n216\n00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:15.955\n&gt;&gt; Because there are tools\nout there that make it very,\n\n217\n00:11:15.955 --> 00:11:19.670\nvery easy to construct email attachments,\nfor example.\n\n218\n00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.760\nAnd then you click on them,\nand guess what?\n\n219\n00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.070\nIt uploads some malware,\nand you're being attacked.\n\n220\n00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.660\nNow, these were largely ignored for\na long time, and then all of a sudden,\n\n221\n00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.570\nTarget came along.\n\n222\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.600\n&gt;&gt; That was a big turning\npoint right there.\n\n223\n00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the reason it's a big\nturning point is because the executive\n\n224\n00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.930\nofficer lost his job over this event.\n\n225\n00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.170\n&gt;&gt; Was it, what, it's 40 million debit and\n\n226\n00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.630\ncredit cards breach during\nthat single attack?\n\n227\n00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n228\n00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:49.390\nA large number, and basically what\nhappened on that was the attacker\n\n229\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.770\ncame in through an air conditioning\nsystem that was computerized, and\n\n230\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.630\nunfortunately, it was on the same\nnetwork as the point of sale\n\n231\n00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.130\ndevices that are at your Target stores.\n\n232\n00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:05.400\nSo, malware was effectively\nloaded up on those point of sale\n\n233\n00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:11.010\nmachines, and those machines reported\nout the sales that were ongoing,\n\n234\n00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.780\nincluding the credit card information,\nand so that's why.\n\n235\n00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:18.860\nAnd everything that I read about Target\nat that point in time, first of all,\n\n236\n00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.570\nit was the Target, and second,\nits security was pretty darn good.\n\n237\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:28.250\nBut it is simple things like\nfailing to separate that air\n\n238\n00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:33.650\nconditioning controlling system, which,\nincidentally, was done to the phone modem.\n\n239\n00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.920\nSo, the air conditioning company\nphoned in, but this time,\n\n240\n00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.540\nit wasn't the air conditioning company.\n\n241\n00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:43.000\nIt was somebody who was able to\nfigure out what was going on,\n\n242\n00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.351\nand was able to upload malware for\nthe point of sale machine.\n\n243\n00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:55.547\nAnd so,\nthat's when things started to change,\n\n244\n00:12:55.547 --> 00:13:00.286\nand we started to see security as\n\n245\n00:13:00.286 --> 00:13:06.480\nbeing a major issue that it is today.\n\n246\n00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.470\nSo let's look at who's hiring.\n\n247\n00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.989\nWell, first of all, everyone is hiring.\n\n248\n00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.130\nThat's the amazing thing.\n\n249\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.338\nNow, this particular, and\nwe heard some earlier monetary amounts,\n\n250\n00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:19.850\nrelative the salaries on earlier video.\n\n251\n00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.800\nBut here, this is somewhat older,\n\n252\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:29.462\nit says in 19, 2013,\nthe average salary for\n\n253\n00:13:29.462 --> 00:13:34.741\na regular IT worker was about $89,000.\n\n254\n00:13:34.741 --> 00:13:38.855\nAnd then with somebody who is cyber\nspecific in their training, and\n\n255\n00:13:38.855 --> 00:13:42.834\ntheir experience in their job,\nin excess of $100,000.\n\n256\n00:13:42.834 --> 00:13:47.635\nSo, that shows you why this is\na good area to concentrate on.\n\n257\n00:13:47.635 --> 00:13:50.517\nIt's the issue of supply and demand.\n\n258\n00:13:50.517 --> 00:13:56.530\nIt is, well, it's low supply high demand.\n\n259\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and like you were talking about\nearlier with coupling your education\n\n260\n00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.400\nwith work experience,\nyou're going to see that number increase.\n\n261\n00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.255\nOf course it's gonna fluctuate,\ndepending on your geographic location.\n\n262\n00:14:06.255 --> 00:14:10.483\nBut I think companies like recruiters,\nRobert Half technology company has\n\n263\n00:14:10.483 --> 00:14:14.577\na really good salary guide out there for\nindividual geographic areas, so\n\n264\n00:14:14.577 --> 00:14:18.560\nyou can kind of get a more, a closer\nidea of what you might be looking at.\n\n265\n00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:25.580\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it might not be a very\ngood definition, but it's okay.\n\n266\n00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.490\nRelative to Cyber Career Opportunities,\nit shows the gambit.\n\n267\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:34.160\nAnd they can be from basically a help\ndesk person who's working a help desk,\n\n268\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.170\na great place to start your career.\n\n269\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.670\n&gt;&gt; I agree.\n\n270\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.390\n&gt;&gt; Because of customer service and\ndeveloping a software.\n\n271\n00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.509\n&gt;&gt; A plethora of different activities or\nissues that you may receive.\n\n272\n00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:44.401\nIt's not gonna be the same\nevery single day, so\n\n273\n00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:46.732\nyou get a really wide range of\nexperience in the help desk.\n\n274\n00:14:46.732 --> 00:14:53.570\n&gt;&gt; Right, but heading up you could become\na, we keep talking about this, an analyst.\n\n275\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.860\nThat's the new position I see more and\nmore advertised.\n\n276\n00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.320\nThat's kind of a mid-level position.\n\n277\n00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.650\nYou may become an architect,\na cyber security architect.\n\n278\n00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:03.740\nThere's a whole range of things.\n\n279\n00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.620\nYou can be a penetration tester.\n\n280\n00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:10.830\nThere are just a bunch of occupations, not\nreally defined very well on this slide.\n\n281\n00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.018\n&gt;&gt; If you were to go ahead and\ndo a search, I want to say,\n\n282\n00:15:14.018 --> 00:15:18.660\nI saw a really comprehensive list on\ncybrary.com under their careers, but\n\n283\n00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.382\nI mean, the list goes on and\non, all the different options.\n\n284\n00:15:22.382 --> 00:15:27.380\nCIO, a lot of different security\nofficer positions as well.\n\n285\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.840\n&gt;&gt; And these slides will be shared\nout on a site that I'm gonna show you\n\n286\n00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.530\nmomentarily, but basically,\nthis gives you some\n\n287\n00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.450\nrecourses at cyber patriot,\nactually has out there, including images.\n\n288\n00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.710\nAnd we'll be talking more about that.\n\n289\n00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.605\nAnd I created this, and this is at each\none of the conclusions of the units.\n\n290\n00:15:46.605 --> 00:15:49.435\nThis is my final thoughts area.\n\n291\n00:15:49.435 --> 00:15:54.713\nAnd if you click on this link,\nand it's tinyurl.com.\n\n292\n00:15:54.713 --> 00:15:58.252\nIt's a shortener,\nnothing's worse than a big, long URL.\n\n293\n00:15:58.252 --> 00:16:03.383\nAnd then behind that, so tinyurl.com/ and\n\n294\n00:16:03.383 --> 00:16:06.910\nit's CyberPatriotContent.\n\n295\n00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.930\nAnd what I've done here is I actually\nuse a site out there, a free site,\n\n296\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.395\nI'm a great believer in free.\n\n297\n00:16:12.395 --> 00:16:15.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's Edublogs, it's designed for\n\n298\n00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.040\nteachers like me.\n\n299\n00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.762\nWhat it provides me with the capability\nof doing is having a main page and\n\n300\n00:16:21.762 --> 00:16:26.183\nthen collecting and then identifying\nthe links on that main page.\n\n301\n00:16:26.183 --> 00:16:29.060\nAnd I've done it by the units and\nthen down below there I have.\n\n302\n00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.640\n&gt;&gt; So this would be our resource,\nour one stop shop.\n\n303\n00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.240\n&gt;&gt; One stop.\n\n304\n00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.870\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna be uploading and\nsharing with us.\n\n305\n00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:34.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n306\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.430\n&gt;&gt; And part of the reason for this is\nI wanna keep this content up to date.\n\n307\n00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.930\nAnd so this is my avenue for\nkeeping it up to date.\n\n308\n00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:41.760\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n309\n00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n310\n00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.200\nSo real quick,\nI'm gonna click here on unit\n\n311\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.440\none just to show you I have\na little bit of stuff up here.\n\n312\n00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.930\nAnd I'm gonna be growing\nit as we go along.\n\n313\n00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.910\nAnd this one site, this is cyberseek.org.\n\n314\n00:16:54.910 --> 00:17:00.400\nWhat I really like about it is it shows\nyou first of all, career pathways.\n\n315\n00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.950\n&gt;&gt; This is what you were\ntrying to show me earlier?\n\n316\n00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.370\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; This is really cool.\n\n317\n00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:07.410\n&gt;&gt; And so this is a starting point for\na entry level position.\n\n318\n00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.110\nThey identify other positions\nhere at a intermediate level and\n\n319\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:12.440\nthen at an advanced level.\n\n320\n00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.843\nSo it's kind of a building\nblock going through,\n\n321\n00:17:15.843 --> 00:17:20.687\nshowing you career paths, career paths\n&gt;&gt; Okay, also CompTIA has some,\n\n322\n00:17:20.687 --> 00:17:24.340\nbecause here's the thing,\nwhen you say you work in IT,\n\n323\n00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.856\npeople who might not be\nfamiliar with this industry.\n\n324\n00:17:27.856 --> 00:17:31.466\nThey just think you know everything,\nall things computer related, well,\n\n325\n00:17:31.466 --> 00:17:34.180\nweb design is not the same\nas network design, right?\n\n326\n00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:40.520\nSo looking at a specific path is important\nso that you can really hone in on your\n\n327\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.940\nskills or what it is that interests you\nbecause you might find your little niche.\n\n328\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.070\nIt might take you a couple of\ndifferent tries to find out what\n\n329\n00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.088\nreally interests you, but you might as\nwell be happy with what you choose, right?\n\n330\n00:17:51.088 --> 00:17:52.565\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

Okay, is it about ten years?\n\n377\n00:20:27.075 --> 00:20:30.570\n&gt;&gt; They mandate and they effectively\ndo that because you can't get\n\n378\n00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:34.050\nthe certification without having\nat least five years of experience.\n\n379\n00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.360\nThey check on that.\n\n380\n00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.764\nBut when I go here to my own\ncommunity to give you some idea of\n\n381\n00:20:38.764 --> 00:20:43.887\nhow much this will drill down, this is the\nSacramento area, this is where I am from.\n\n382\n00:20:43.887 --> 00:20:45.470\n&gt;&gt; And they break it down by county.\n\n383\n00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, by basically regional area.\n\n384\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n385\n00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.270\n&gt;&gt; This is economic development and\nif we look down here.\n\n386\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.820\nYou can see that we currently\nhave in my Sacramento region,\n\n387\n00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.850\n491 people with CISSP certification.\n\n388\n00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:02.860\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n389\n00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.980\n&gt;&gt; And look at how many jobs we have\nthat are unfilled where they are trying\n\n390\n00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:11.260\nto seek an individual, that's 619.\n\n391\n00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.100\nSo that's an extreme shortage.\n\n392\n00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you hear people all the time\nI can't get work, I can't get work.\n\n393\n00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.570\nWell, we're telling you\ncheck out your area.\n\n394\n00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:23.300\nThere are tools right here that Steve\nis sharing with us to help you get on\n\n395\n00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.670\nthe right path there.\n\n396\n00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.430\n&gt;&gt; So I think that that\npretty well identifies for\n\n397\n00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.150\nyou the opportunities out there.\n\n398\n00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:32.930\nSure, well, thank you, Steve,\nfor explaining exactly\n\n399\n00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:37.110\nwhat cyber security is and\nproviding us with some tools to go ahead.\n\n400\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.930\nAnd look at our specific regions\nto see what that availability\n\n401\n00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.230\nactually looks like.\n\n402\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.460\nAnd thank you ladies and gentlemen for\ntuning in, but don't go anywhere,\n\n403\n00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.380\nwe have a lot more headed your way.\n\n404\n00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.620\nWe're actually going to be looking into\nonline security, safety, coming up next.\n\n405\n00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.440\nSo get comfortable.\n\n406\n00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.380\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n407\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.353\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Steve Linthicum.\n\n408\n00:21:56.353 --> 00:21:58.940\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here for\nyour CyberPatriot training.\n\n409\n00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.405\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Hi, how you doing?\n\n13\n00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.620\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n14\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.872\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're gonna go through and\nwe're gonna talk about online safety.\n\n15\n00:00:32.872 --> 00:00:36.329\nNow, I'm gonna date myself a little bit,\nbecause when I was a kid,\n\n16\n00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.578\nI had two instructions from my parents,\none was don't take candy from strangers,\n\n17\n00:00:40.578 --> 00:00:43.055\nand the other one was\ndon't talk to strangers.\n\n18\n00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:44.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Did you ever get that message?\n\n19\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.200\n&gt;&gt; That sounds pretty familiar Steve,\nyeah, I did.\n\n20\n00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.270\n&gt;&gt; Life was a lot simpler then, and\n\n21\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.140\nthat we didn't have this\nthing call the Internet.\n\n22\n00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.618\n&gt;&gt; I'm very thankful for that.\n\n23\n00:00:53.618 --> 00:00:55.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n24\n00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.320\nIt is a real challenge for parents today,\nto be quite honest with you.\n\n25\n00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.626\n&gt;&gt; And children and students, yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:03.520\n&gt;&gt; And children, yes, yes,\n\n27\n00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.250\nbecause we don't know who is\na stranger and who isn't a stranger.\n\n28\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.070\nThat's one of the challenges that we face\n\n29\n00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.620\neven though I may be communicating\nwith who I think is you,\n\n30\n00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.130\nhow do I really know it's you when\nI'm going across the Internet?\n\n31\n00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.020\n&gt;&gt; I don't.\n&gt;&gt; You really don't, and\n\n32\n00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.650\nwe haven't got any mechanisms and\nin place that really help us.\n\n33\n00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.040\nGive you a sense of what I'm talking\nabout, I bank at Bank of America.\n\n34\n00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.940\nAnd I know it's here in Florida,\nyeah, Bank of America.\n\n35\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do.\n\n36\n00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.492\n&gt;&gt; And so when I go on to the Internet,\nand I type in www.bankofamerica.com,\n\n37\n00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:39.720\nhow do I know that's\nthe real Bank of America?\n\n38\n00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, here's the thing.\n\n39\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.040\nAs we're looking for little clues and\nidentifiers, like NRURL or URI,\n\n40\n00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.630\nuniform resource locator or\nuniform resource identifier.\n\n41\n00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.119\nWe wanna be looking for that s for\nthat HTTPS that we're using secure\n\n42\n00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.132\nprotocols in addition\nto the HTTP protocol.\n\n43\n00:01:57.132 --> 00:02:00.494\nBut that's not always 100%\nguaranteed to be safe,\n\n44\n00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:03.292\nthere are other mechanisms\nthat are in place.\n\n45\n00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:07.701\nYour bank may require some kind of\nmutual indication when you log on, so\n\n46\n00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:12.258\nthat the actual web server has to\nprovide identification to US customer,\n\n47\n00:02:12.258 --> 00:02:15.590\nas well as you putting in\nyour username and password.\n\n48\n00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and you're right,\nwe have that avenue.\n\n49\n00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.370\nBut the reason it's got HTTPS up there\nis because Bank of America has gone\n\n50\n00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.950\nto somebody like Verisign, and they've\nobtained something called a certificate.\n\n51\n00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.140\nAnd I don't know about you, but\nI never look at the certificates, do you?\n\n52\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.555\n&gt;&gt; I do, only because I'm an instructor,\nand I show them to students.\n\n53\n00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:40.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You show them, but every time I went to\n\n54\n00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.030\nBank of America, I was gonna spend\nthe time to look at the certificate,\n\n55\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.320\nand you can do that,\nit's fairly easy to do.\n\n56\n00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.490\nIt's just time that I don't do, I guess.\n\n57\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.160\n&gt;&gt; We trust it.\n\n58\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.020\n&gt;&gt; We trust.\n\n59\n00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.990\nIn Verisign, we trust.\n\n60\n00:02:54.495 --> 00:02:57.710\n&gt;&gt; Verisign, geo trust, global trust.\n\n61\n00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.500\nThat's what these companies,\n\n62\n00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.320\nour certification authorities\nare built off of this trust.\n\n63\n00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, but recent knowledge that\nI have relative to certification\n\n64\n00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.540\nentities suggest to me that not all\nof them are all that honest, and-\n\n65\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.410\n&gt;&gt; Just like other-\n\n66\n00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.980\n&gt;&gt; Trustworthy.\n\n67\n00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, companies.\n\n68\n00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.390\n&gt;&gt; That lock that we get up\nnext to the URL, it's a lock,\n\n69\n00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.030\nit's not a strong lock, a weak lock, there\nreally isn't any reference to that lock.\n\n70\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.590\nA lock is a lock.\n\n71\n00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.340\nAnd whether or\nnot it's issued by Verisign, or\n\n72\n00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.080\nsome other certificate issuer\nout of China, for example.\n\n73\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.670\nIt's still a lock.\n\n74\n00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and some companies,\nthey even create, they generate their own\n\n75\n00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.270\ndigital certificates internally for\ntheir corporate networks,\n\n76\n00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.960\nbecause they don't even\n&gt;&gt; They don't wanna\n\n77\n00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.230\nentrust a third-party entity to be\nissuing out those certificates.\n\n78\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nlet me show you online real quick.\n\n79\n00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.090\nI'm gonna go into my browser.\n\n80\n00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.631\n&gt;&gt; See, you do, you do look at them.\n\n81\n00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:57.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here we go here.\n\n82\n00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.750\nI'm gonna give you an example\nof something here.\n\n83\n00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.870\nI'm gonna go to SSLlabs.com, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.990\nAnd here we are on SSLlabs.com,\nwhere you can test web servers.\n\n85\n00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.350\nAnd web servers are out there,\nthey're publicly accessible,\n\n86\n00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.060\nmeaning that the public needs\nto be able to get to them.\n\n87\n00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.104\nBecause otherwise, why would you have\na website up on the Internet, right?\n\n88\n00:04:20.104 --> 00:04:21.780\n[LAUGH] Makes common sense to me.\n\n89\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.590\nAnd you can go through here, and\nwe can click here, test your server.\n\n90\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.200\nSo this is test your web server.\n\n91\n00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.930\nNow, what I've done is,\nI've brought up a site here.\n\n92\n00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.710\nAnd I did this last week.\n\n93\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.620\nI was giving a presentation\nto a bunch of supervisors\n\n94\n00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.790\nat a county office of education.\n\n95\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.000\nAnd these were superintendents\nall the way to\n\n96\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.350\nteachers that were in the room,\nquite a group of them.\n\n97\n00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.110\nAnd so what I did was I went to the site\nwhere the teachers sign on, and\n\n98\n00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.580\nI think that this is fairly common for\nschool districts.\n\n99\n00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.325\nYour teachers sign on,\nfor example, for me,\n\n100\n00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:01.035\nthere's a place called\nMy Sierra where I sign on.\n\n101\n00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:03.825\nMy grades are issued through that site.\n\n102\n00:05:03.825 --> 00:05:06.065\nIt's a pretty important place to be.\n\n103\n00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:07.085\n&gt;&gt; An employee portal?\n\n104\n00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:08.475\n&gt;&gt; Right, an employee portal.\n\n105\n00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:13.537\nAnd so all you do is you just copy and\nyou paste that site into this.\n\n106\n00:05:13.537 --> 00:05:14.817\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n107\n00:05:14.817 --> 00:05:19.687\n&gt;&gt; URL, and what's happening now is\nit's gonna go through a series of tests.\n\n108\n00:05:19.687 --> 00:05:22.927\nAnd we'll start talking\nabout cyberbullying,\n\n109\n00:05:22.927 --> 00:05:25.467\nbecause this test is gonna go on for\na little while.\n\n110\n00:05:25.467 --> 00:05:27.737\nBut we'll check its\ngrade when we come back.\n\n111\n00:05:27.737 --> 00:05:28.237\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n112\n00:05:28.237 --> 00:05:33.568\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, let me go onto here.\n\n113\n00:05:33.568 --> 00:05:36.400\nAnd what we're gonna do is look\nat the learning objectives for\n\n114\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.870\nthis particular ops.\n\n115\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.370\nHere we go.\n\n116\n00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.710\nOkay, so participants will understand the\ndefinitions and context of cyberbullying.\n\n117\n00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.560\nSo, we're gonna talk\nabout what that means.\n\n118\n00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.830\nParticipants will understand what makes\ncertain type of information private or\n\n119\n00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.320\nmore sensitive than others, and\n\n120\n00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.930\nthen we'll also look at participants\ngaining an understanding of how to\n\n121\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.520\nprotect themselves online, and\nappropriate use of the Internet.\n\n122\n00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.738\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Those are the key component for\n\n123\n00:06:06.738 --> 00:06:11.584\nthis whole unit, we just gonna cover\nthe first part though with cyberbullying.\n\n124\n00:06:11.584 --> 00:06:17.738\nAnd we all know what bullying is,\nand we all know that it's not right.\n\n125\n00:06:17.738 --> 00:06:21.313\nAnd what happens is that when you\nget out there on the Internet,\n\n126\n00:06:21.313 --> 00:06:25.510\nyou cannot be yourself, or you could\nbe yourself and be bullying people.\n\n127\n00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.090\n&gt;&gt; Sure, you get that anonymity.\n\n128\n00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.380\n&gt;&gt; Right, you have the ability\nto hide your identification or\n\n129\n00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.706\nto identify yourself as somebody\nyou're not, that maybe somebody who's-\n\n130\n00:06:35.706 --> 00:06:36.864\n&gt;&gt; Spoofing your identity.\n\n131\n00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:38.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, spoofing your identity.\n\n132\n00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.110\nSo, we don't want you doing these things,\n\n133\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.020\nand you don't wanna any of your\nfriends doing this things.\n\n134\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.145\nIt's not really right,\nso don't spam forums or\n\n135\n00:06:49.145 --> 00:06:52.730\nchat rooms, basically,\nthis is a list of do-nots.\n\n136\n00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.550\nDo not pretend to be somebody else.\n\n137\n00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.110\nDo not post or\ndistribute illegal material.\n\n138\n00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.390\nDo not use abusive or\nthreatening language.\n\n139\n00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.350\nDo not try and obtain personal\ninformation about someone else.\n\n140\n00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.280\nThese are things that you shouldn't do.\n\n141\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.570\n&gt;&gt; Now, Steve, you're not just\ntrying to be a Debbie down here.\n\n142\n00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.670\nSome of these components are legitimate.\n\n143\n00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.590\nThey have legalities behind them that can\nland you guys in some trouble if you don't\n\n144\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.700\nlisten to what he's saying here [LAUGH].\n\n145\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n146\n00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.540\nAnd we don't want you\nlanding into trouble.\n\n147\n00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.920\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nwe're the opposite of that here, yes.\n\n148\n00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.870\n&gt;&gt; What we're trying to do is\npromote a cybersecurity work force.\n\n149\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.220\nIf you do bad things, you won't be on\nthe workforce, it’s really that simple.\n\n150\n00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.295\n&gt;&gt; Right, because it is just like we\nwere trusting the certificate, or\n\n151\n00:07:34.295 --> 00:07:37.010\n[LAUGH] excuse me,\ncertificate authorities.\n\n152\n00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.320\nYou also have to trust your employees,\nand once your reputation get smeared in\n\n153\n00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.360\nthe mud, then it's really almost\nimpossible to regain that trust.\n\n154\n00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.770\n&gt;&gt; Right, so, these are some other\nthings that we need to talk about.\n\n155\n00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:56.630\nBullying refers to any unwanted\naggressive behavior, any unwanted.\n\n156\n00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.390\nCyberbullying refers to the bullying\nthat takes place through use of\n\n157\n00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:06.700\nelectronic technology, through use of\naccess to the Internet with the forums.\n\n158\n00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.700\nWe got a whole list of them here,\nand I could go through them, but\n\n159\n00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.710\nyou can read them as well as I can.\n\n160\n00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.720\nCurrently, according to this slide,\nbullying effects on almost\n\n161\n00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.410\n30% of students every year and\nthe number is growing.\n\n162\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.990\nAnd I suspect that that's true.\n\n163\n00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:34.090\nAnd well, why it's harmful, because it\ncan be done at any time of day or night,\n\n164\n00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:40.850\nand it can be done anonymously, meaning\nthat whoever is doing the bullying, they\n\n165\n00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:45.530\ncan in their own mind get away with it,\nbut it's not a right thing to do, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.540\nSo, what happens if it happens to you?\n\n167\n00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.870\nWell, do not respond to\nany of the messages,\n\n168\n00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.200\nbecause that's just gonna\negg the other person on.\n\n169\n00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.230\n&gt;&gt; Fuel their fire, yup.\n\n170\n00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so don't respond.\n\n171\n00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.090\n&gt;&gt; Don't play into that negativity.\n\n172\n00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.190\n&gt;&gt; Block offenders.\n\n173\n00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.730\nA lot of the software,\n\n174\n00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:08.160\nthe social media areas where you can go\nallow you to block under their settings.\n\n175\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.340\nAny future communication between you and\nthat other party.\n\n176\n00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.110\nDocument and report the behavior so\n\n177\n00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:19.150\nit can be addressed, and flag the content\nso other people aren't hurt by it.\n\n178\n00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:25.350\nThose are all helpful hints\nrelative to this and report it.\n\n179\n00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.240\nReport it.\n\n180\n00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.000\nIf you're at school,\nand this is happening,\n\n181\n00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.940\nwhether it's cyberbullying or\nany kind of bullying, report it.\n\n182\n00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.620\nAnd for your parents and\nlaw enforcement, you should also report.\n\n183\n00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.830\nBe sure to involve your parents\nin that sort of activity.\n\n184\n00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:45.590\nBut if anybody threatens you, relative\nto violence, or if you get messages or\n\n185\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:50.610\nphotos, one of the things with messages\nand photos, take a screenshot.\n\n186\n00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.580\nOkay, it's fairly simple to do,\ndepending upon your operating system.\n\n187\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.380\nI use an Alt and a print screen,\nand that gives me a screenshot, and\n\n188\n00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.480\nthen save it in some fashion.\n\n189\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.386\nAnd there are software out there where you\ncan save that particular screen image,\n\n190\n00:10:04.386 --> 00:10:08.358\nbecause that may be evidence down the road\nthat will be helpful to law enforcement.\n\n191\n00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:09.013\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n192\n00:10:09.013 --> 00:10:13.063\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\njust be really really careful,\n\n193\n00:10:13.063 --> 00:10:18.687\nthat's what this whole slide\ntries to present to, the idea\n\n194\n00:10:18.687 --> 00:10:22.822\nthat you should be careful, okay, and-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n195\n00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:26.920\nI also see on there, stalking and\nhate crimes you had on that slide.\n\n196\n00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.485\nBut the thing is, we are gonna be looking\nat here in a little bit about PI,\n\n197\n00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:35.050\npersonally identifiable information,\nbut that kind of all goes to it.\n\n198\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.360\nYou don't wanna give out information\nthat they can use to bully you as well.\n\n199\n00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.921\nSo, try to keep that in mind too\nas you're about post things.\n\n200\n00:10:41.921 --> 00:10:46.709\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's bring my screen\nback up for the surprise grade for-\n\n201\n00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:47.507\n&gt;&gt; What did we get?\n\n202\n00:10:47.507 --> 00:10:48.789\n&gt;&gt; The [LAUGH] website.\n\n203\n00:10:48.789 --> 00:10:49.613\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n204\n00:10:49.613 --> 00:10:54.780\n&gt;&gt; And you can imagine this room of\nadministrators were not exactly thrilled.\n\n205\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:55.910\nAnd guess what?\n\n206\n00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.500\nThis was last Wednesday, and\nthey haven't corrected the situation.\n\n207\n00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.380\nBut they're now well aware that I assume,\nin rather short order,\n\n208\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.650\nthat it will be corrected.\n\n209\n00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.780\nThe challenge here is this\nis a focus on that lock.\n\n210\n00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.240\nThe reason why this\nparticular site got an F\n\n211\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.075\nis because that lock isn't\nas secure as it should be.\n\n212\n00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:22.400\nThere's ways to break through that lock.\n\n213\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.850\nAnd for example, if this were\nBank of America, and it isn't,\n\n214\n00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:29.460\nit's a school district, and I were\nlogging into my account, how do I login?\n\n215\n00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.040\nWell, I give them a username,\nand I give them a password.\n\n216\n00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.300\nAnd if somebody were able to break\nthrough that encrypted traffic\n\n217\n00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.360\nthat lock represents, guess what?\n\n218\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.580\nThey could get my username and password,\nand they could do damage to me.\n\n219\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.410\nSo, that's the basis for this F.\n\n220\n00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.406\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Which isn't exactly a satisfactory\n\n221\n00:11:50.406 --> 00:11:52.338\ngrade, as I recall In my days in school.\n\n222\n00:11:52.338 --> 00:11:54.841\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nif they still do things the same.\n\n223\n00:11:54.841 --> 00:11:58.092\n&gt;&gt; So, that gets us pretty\nwell through cyberbullying.\n\n224\n00:11:58.092 --> 00:12:00.058\nI mean, not-\n&gt;&gt; Online safety.\n\n225\n00:12:00.058 --> 00:12:04.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, I think it's a good place to-\n&gt;&gt; Well, go ahead and wrap up here.\n\n226\n00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.320\nLooks like that's all we have for\nthis episode.\n\n227\n00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.440\nThank you for helping us out today, Steve.\n\n228\n00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.340\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for joining us today.\n\n229\n00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.230\nBut stay tuned.\n\n230\n00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.730\nWe have more CyberPatriot coming your way.\n\n231\n00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.350\nSo for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap up here.\n\n232\n00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.280\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n233\n00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.320\n&gt;&gt;

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.490\nWelcome to ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n2\n00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.596\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:12.208\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:15.226\n&gt;&gt; Welcome CyberPatriots to\nyour online training videos.\n\n5\n00:00:15.226 --> 00:00:17.430\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.850\nIn this particular episode,\nwe'll be looking at cyber ethics.\n\n7\n00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.420\nWe'll understand what it is and how we\ncan actually adhere to cyber ethics.\n\n8\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.640\nWith us today,\nwe have Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n9\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.370\nThank you for being with us today, Steve.\n\n10\n00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.038\n&gt;&gt; Hi there, how are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:32.038 --> 00:00:32.749\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n12\n00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:34.079\nThat's great.\n\n13\n00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.850\nSo we're gonna be talking\nabout ethics today.\n\n14\n00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.860\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and hopefully,\nwe'll all have ethical behavior\n\n15\n00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.860\nrelative to watching this and studying\nethics, cuz that's really important, okay?\n\n16\n00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.740\nSo let's get started with the slides.\n\n17\n00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.830\nFirst slide up here is my intro slide, and\nyou'll notice I haven't explained this in\n\n18\n00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.960\nthe past that I'm also something\ncalled a deputy sector navigator.\n\n19\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.640\nPart of what I do is I have release time\nto work with the chancellor's office in\n\n20\n00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.320\nCalifornia, and my job is to\npromote cyber security education.\n\n21\n00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.010\nSo that's part of what\nI'm doing here today.\n\n22\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.220\nAnd I just wanted to introduce that\nbecause it looks a little strange up\n\n23\n00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.440\nthere with that DSN.\n\n24\n00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.320\n&gt;&gt; That's okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n25\n00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.000\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go through Unit Three.\n\n27\n00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.720\nThis is, again, the materials that\nCyberPatriot has prepared for\n\n28\n00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.300\nstudents like you.\n\n29\n00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.250\nAnd as you go through here,\nwe'll go to the first slide,\n\n30\n00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.990\nI wanna point out something,\nbecause this is an ethical issue.\n\n31\n00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.160\nNotice in the lower left-hand\ncorner of the slide,\n\n32\n00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.540\nit says copyright Air Force Association.\n\n33\n00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.829\nThe Air Force Association\nis sponsoring CyberPatriot.\n\n34\n00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.249\nThey are the organization that created it,\nand I'm using their slides.\n\n35\n00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:44.563\nIt's their property, and\nI'm using them for a proper purpose.\n\n36\n00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:48.760\nI'm not violating any\nethical obligation at all.\n\n37\n00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you hear this term,\nintellectual property.\n\n38\n00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nthis is their intellectual property.\n\n39\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.305\nSo what we're gonna do as we\ngo through this module is\n\n40\n00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:03.100\nwe're gonna get you to a level where\nyou understand what ethics are.\n\n41\n00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.110\nYou understand why they are important.\n\n42\n00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.870\nYou understand how to act ethically.\n\n43\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.700\nYou understand the responsibility\nthat comes with knowing cybersecurity\n\n44\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.840\nprinciples, and\nthat line right there is very important.\n\n45\n00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.009\nAnd we're gonna talk about how to\napply ethics in real world situations.\n\n46\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.048\nSo this is the 10 Commandments\nof Computer Ethics.\n\n47\n00:02:25.048 --> 00:02:27.580\nIt has been developed by\nthe Air Force Association.\n\n48\n00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.080\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n49\n00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.370\n&gt;&gt; It's the thou shalt nots.\n\n50\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n51\n00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.480\nyou can see the first one is thou shalt\nnot use a computer to harm others.\n\n52\n00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.270\nNext one is thou shall not interfere\nwith other people's computer work.\n\n53\n00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.495\nNext one is thou shalt not snoop\naround other people's computer files.\n\n54\n00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:50.925\nYou shouldn't steal using computers,\nobviously that's the next one.\n\n55\n00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:54.670\nThou shall not use a computers\nto bear false witness.\n\n56\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.830\nThat's telling lies about people,\nbasically.\n\n57\n00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.370\nAnd thou shall not copy or use proprietary\nsoftware for which you have not paid.\n\n58\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.560\nThou shall not use other people's computer\nresources without authorization or\n\n59\n00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.410\nproper compensation.\n\n60\n00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.980\nThou shall not appropriate other\npeople's intellectual output.\n\n61\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.420\nAgain, coming back to the slide,\n\n62\n00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.640\nthis is the intellectual output\nof the Airforce Association.\n\n63\n00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.080\nThey own it,\nthey have the copyright for it.\n\n64\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.822\nAnd again, I.\n\n65\n00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:26.395\n&gt;&gt; I think we'll go full screen on\nthis one just to take a look at\n\n66\n00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:27.470\nthe number nine.\n\n67\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.626\nIts hiding behind my head here,\nthere we go also.\n\n68\n00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:35.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay, this is intellectual property\nof the Air Force Association, and\n\n69\n00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.040\nobviously, we're using it for\na proper purpose,\n\n70\n00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.220\nbecause they created this to help\nstudents learn these principles.\n\n71\n00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.427\nNext one is think about social\nconsequences of the program\n\n72\n00:03:48.427 --> 00:03:52.794\nyou are writing or\nthe system you are designing.\n\n73\n00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:57.680\nAnd then the final one is thou shall\nalways use computers in ways that\n\n74\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.407\nensure consideration and respect for\nyour fellow human beings.\n\n75\n00:04:02.407 --> 00:04:06.387\n&gt;&gt; Well, Steve, going through that list,\nit doesn't look like those are all\n\n76\n00:04:06.387 --> 00:04:11.350\nlegal requirements, but this is where that\nterm ethics really comes into play, right?\n\n77\n00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.609\nIt's knowing what is right and\nwrong and acting upon that.\n\n78\n00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.461\n&gt;&gt; That's correct, and we're gonna talk\na little bit about the difference between\n\n79\n00:04:19.461 --> 00:04:21.535\nwhat is legal and what is ethical.\n\n80\n00:04:21.535 --> 00:04:23.868\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now, you can make a pretty good\n\n81\n00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:29.890\nassumption that anything that is\nillegal probably isn't ethical.\n\n82\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.300\nAnd that's a pretty safe mode to be in.\n\n83\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.090\nBut just because something isn't\nillegal doesn't make it ethical.\n\n84\n00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.550\nDoes that make sense?\n\n85\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n86\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; There are some strange laws out there.\n\n87\n00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.570\nI've seen some pretty\nodd ones that really,\n\n88\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.340\nwe don't understand why they're in place.\n\n89\n00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.450\nBut you know what?\n\n90\n00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.320\nIt's the law.\n\n91\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.910\n&gt;&gt; It's the law.\n\n92\n00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.210\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah.\n\n93\n00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.250\n&gt;&gt; And you're always pretty\nsafe in complying with the law.\n\n94\n00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.585\nAt least you know you're not gonna\nprobably go to jail if you're\n\n95\n00:04:57.585 --> 00:04:58.893\ncomplying with the law.\n\n96\n00:04:58.893 --> 00:05:03.256\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that generalization that you\njust stated about, look, we can go ahead\n\n97\n00:05:03.256 --> 00:05:07.128\nand generalize that if it is illegal,\nit's usually unethical as well.\n\n98\n00:05:07.128 --> 00:05:09.322\nThat's a safe comment to make there.\n\n99\n00:05:09.322 --> 00:05:09.864\n&gt;&gt; A safe comment, yes.\n\n100\n00:05:09.864 --> 00:05:13.941\nAlthough there are some laws on the books\nthat are somewhat questionable as to\n\n101\n00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:16.210\nwhether or not they are still applicable.\n\n102\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.690\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; What happens is that the law is moving.\n\n103\n00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.920\nIt should be moving as society changes,\n\n104\n00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.480\nand a great example of\nthis is civil rights law.\n\n105\n00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.230\nWay back when I was a child,\nthese civil rights laws were not in\n\n106\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.945\nplace like they are today, and there were\n\n107\n00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:41.760\nbehaviors out there that probably\nwould be shocking today for society.\n\n108\n00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.550\nBut the law has creeped up and\ntry to keep up.\n\n109\n00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.080\n&gt;&gt; Update, yeah\n&gt;&gt; With what’s appropriate behaviors.\n\n110\n00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.384\nSo let's go on to the next slide.\n\n111\n00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:55.880\nAnd this is ethics is about right and\nwrong.\n\n112\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.340\nWhat's right, and what's wrong,\nand how do we know?\n\n113\n00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.960\nAnd I guess in large part,\nthis is almost a gut feeling sometimes.\n\n114\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.070\nWhen you're going through trying to\ndetermine what actions you're going to\n\n115\n00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.020\ntake, whether or\nnot they're ethical or not.\n\n116\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.910\nAnd so this is why it's important to\nteach ethics and to learn ethics, so\n\n117\n00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.070\nthat you know where the line is,\nwhat is proper and what is improper.\n\n118\n00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit's not always our first impulse.\n\n119\n00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.200\nAnd we'll see that as we go through some\nactual scenarios here a little bit later,\n\n120\n00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.800\nwhat always might be something\nyou might wanna jump to at first,\n\n121\n00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.740\nyou have to stop back.\n\n122\n00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.546\nEvaluate the situation, and then like\nSteve said, you'll have that feeling, okay\n\n123\n00:06:35.546 --> 00:06:40.235\nlook, maybe this is more appealing, but\nI can tell it's not the right thing to do.\n\n124\n00:06:40.235 --> 00:06:42.667\nSo what's ethics?\n\n125\n00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:46.309\nWell, it promotes fairness,\na sense of fairness.\n\n126\n00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:48.038\nAnd again, that's an internal feeling.\n\n127\n00:06:48.038 --> 00:06:51.510\nI know that this is fair,\nor I know this is unfair.\n\n128\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.820\nIt creates a set of rules\nthat are acceptable behavior.\n\n129\n00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.340\nEthical practices help us to identify\nwhat is unacceptable behavior,\n\n130\n00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.910\nhow it looks, how it feels,\nthat internal gut feeling thing.\n\n131\n00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.380\nAnd we have standards for right and wrong.\n\n132\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.480\nIn cybersecurity, for example,\nthere are behaviors that organizations\n\n133\n00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.740\nhave created and defined that are deemed\neither ethical or not ethical.\n\n134\n00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.160\nTo give you some idea, oftentimes,\n\n135\n00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.480\nthe term ethics is used\nwith the canons of ethics.\n\n136\n00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.172\nAnd these are rules that\nare not necessarily laws.\n\n137\n00:07:40.172 --> 00:07:40.680\nAnd I use, for\n\n138\n00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.390\nexample, when you go through one of\nthe certifications I have is the CISSP.\n\n139\n00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.687\nAnd there are ethical behaviors,\n\n140\n00:07:48.687 --> 00:07:53.186\nresponsibilities that are defined\nrelative to that certification.\n\n141\n00:07:53.186 --> 00:07:56.959\nAnd I have to agree in\nwriting to be bound by those.\n\n142\n00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:03.572\nAnd in effect, one is that I have\nan ethical obligation relative\n\n143\n00:08:03.572 --> 00:08:08.960\nto my employer to ensure that\ntheir systems are up and\n\n144\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.650\nrunning and\nnot being open to attack, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.764\nAnd so when I see, for\nexample at my college, and in my case,\n\n146\n00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:23.032\nthat's my employer, that our IT\ndepartment hasn't done something right.\n\n147\n00:08:23.032 --> 00:08:25.430\nAnd let me give you an example.\n\n148\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.650\nThis is an example that I'm sure\nthat they won't feel bad about.\n\n149\n00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.380\nWe were running on our computer\nnetwork at the college,\n\n150\n00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.990\nwe were running some old Windows Servers,\nWindows Server 2003.\n\n151\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:46.200\nAnd Microsoft quit supporting Windows\nServer 2003 about a year and a half ago.\n\n152\n00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.940\nMeaning, they're no longer patching it for\nhacking.\n\n153\n00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:54.190\nAnd as part of a classroom exercise,\nI was showing students\n\n154\n00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.910\na product out there that allows you\nto see what's out on the Internet and\n\n155\n00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.950\nwhether or\nnot it's potentially vulnerable.\n\n156\n00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.960\nAnd I ran the IP address range,\nand we'll talk more about that.\n\n157\n00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.803\nBut for my college,\nthe public IP address range,\n\n158\n00:09:08.803 --> 00:09:12.934\nand I found Windows Server\n2003 boxes out there.\n\n159\n00:09:12.934 --> 00:09:18.444\nAnd so what I did was I wrote an email\nto the head of the IT department and\n\n160\n00:09:18.444 --> 00:09:20.724\ntold him about this issue and\n\n161\n00:09:20.724 --> 00:09:25.485\nidentified the fact that Windows\nis no longer supporting.\n\n162\n00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:27.080\n&gt;&gt; So you identify that vulnerability?\n\n163\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.780\n&gt;&gt; Right, and watched what happened.\n\n164\n00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.674\nWell, if you go out today, and if you have\nto run an IP address range looking for\n\n165\n00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:37.455\nWindows 2003 servers,\nthey're no longer there.\n\n166\n00:09:37.455 --> 00:09:43.565\nSo I discharged my ethical obligation\nthat was imposed by an organization,\n\n167\n00:09:43.565 --> 00:09:47.580\nby the ISCC,\nthat provides that certification.\n\n168\n00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.672\nI had to do it,\nit was an ethical responsibility.\n\n169\n00:09:50.672 --> 00:09:51.501\nMake sense?\n\n170\n00:09:51.501 --> 00:09:55.070\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and also,\nfrom the standpoint that Steve,\n\n171\n00:09:55.070 --> 00:10:00.890\nif you were the head of the IT department\nand you had that responsibility of ethics.\n\n172\n00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.390\nYou would need to understand it, so you\ncould incorporate that into your policies,\n\n173\n00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.195\nso you could enforce it corporate-wide,\nalso.\n\n174\n00:10:07.195 --> 00:10:10.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo again, ethics are the standards for\n\n175\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.980\nright and wrong,\nnot necessarily legal and illegal.\n\n176\n00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.050\nSo you need to differentiate\nbetween those.\n\n177\n00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:21.230\nEthical standards can be both written and\nunwritten.\n\n178\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.739\nAnd I guess a good example of what\nmay well be an unwritten one is\n\n179\n00:10:25.739 --> 00:10:29.317\nthe golden rule,\nwhich is written everywhere.\n\n180\n00:10:29.317 --> 00:10:32.690\nDo unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you.\n\n181\n00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:37.330\nAnd that's a cornerstone,\nas we look at ethics.\n\n182\n00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:42.540\nAs I mentioned here on the slide,\nwritings are examples\n\n183\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:48.880\nof the company's mission policy statement,\nschool policies on academic dishonesty.\n\n184\n00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.250\nUnwritten, they give\na perfect example here.\n\n185\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.240\nDon't cut in line.\n\n186\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.060\nMeaning, you don't jump ahead of somebody\nwhen there's a big long line of people\n\n187\n00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.070\ntrying to get to a door,\nor they're in line for\n\n188\n00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.240\ncoffee at Starbucks, that sort of\n&gt;&gt; And from a technology standpoint,\n\n189\n00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.140\nsometimes like you told us about prior\nthe CIA triad, for the confidentiality.\n\n190\n00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.370\nLet's say one of your managers\nhas a computer problem,\n\n191\n00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.870\nand you need to go fix it, and\nyou accidentally come across an email that\n\n192\n00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.620\nwasn't originally intended for\nyour viewing.\n\n193\n00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.930\nAnd maybe they're having cut backs, and\n\n194\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:27.130\nyou see that your friend is listed\nthere on whose going to be let go.\n\n195\n00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:31.470\nThat's something you're not supposed\nto go back and say, hey, I saw.\n\n196\n00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.661\nSo that's what we're talking about here.\n\n197\n00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:35.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n198\n00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.970\nAnd some of it's courtesy,\nthey give an example here on this slide,\n\n199\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.530\nholding an elevator for people.\n\n200\n00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.380\nEthically, we should be behaving so\n\n201\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.560\nthat we're helping other people,\nthat sort of thing.\n\n202\n00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.870\nSo the sources of ethics,\nI mentioned this a couple of times.\n\n203\n00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.890\nWell, laws are an obvious\nsource of ethics.\n\n204\n00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.770\nThat which society has deemed\nthrough legislation as\n\n205\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.486\nbeing unlawful is unethical,\ngenerally, okay?\n\n206\n00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:06.520\nFeelings, how do you feel?\n\n207\n00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.599\nSocial norms.\n\n208\n00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.380\nA lot of ethics are based upon religion.\n\n209\n00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.750\nI mentioned the golden rule, and\nwe've got the 10 commandments and\n\n210\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.410\nall kinds of things out there.\n\n211\n00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.961\nPhilosophy and family.\n\n212\n00:12:20.961 --> 00:12:27.520\nSo these are all key sources of ethics and\nwhat society defines as ethical behavior.\n\n213\n00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.940\nOther things here relative\nto ethical behavior.\n\n214\n00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.930\nDo people make good decisions?\n\n215\n00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.300\nWell, we hope they do.\n\n216\n00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.050\nBut do they always make good decisions?\n\n217\n00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.960\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; No, I know I don't.\n\n218\n00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.174\n&gt;&gt; Do you make?\n\n219\n00:12:42.174 --> 00:12:43.117\n&gt;&gt; You try, yeah, you try [LAUGH].\n\n220\n00:12:43.117 --> 00:12:45.240\n&gt;&gt; Did you make good decisions?\n\n221\n00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.960\nWell, generally, I would say that I do,\nand I hope that you do.\n\n222\n00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.138\nBut we do not always make good decisions.\n\n223\n00:12:53.138 --> 00:12:55.270\n&gt;&gt; We're human.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're humans.\n\n224\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.497\nSo does a bad decision\nmean you're unethical?\n\n225\n00:12:57.497 --> 00:12:58.570\nNo.\n\n226\n00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.290\n&gt;&gt; It means you're human.\n\n227\n00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.630\n&gt;&gt; It means you're a human being,\nand yeah.\n\n228\n00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:06.550\n&gt;&gt; We just have to strive to make\nthe best decisions we possibly can.\n\n229\n00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.491\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n230\n00:13:08.491 --> 00:13:10.981\nSo understanding versus behavior,\n\n231\n00:13:10.981 --> 00:13:16.210\nknowing right from wrong doesn't\nautomatically mean we do the right thing.\n\n232\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:20.040\nWe've got free choice, and\nyou can go down an ethical path, or\n\n233\n00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.110\nyou can choose to go down a not so\nethical path.\n\n234\n00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.960\nAnd what we're trying to promote here for\nstudents is that you\n\n235\n00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.570\nrecognize the difference, and\nyou proceed down an ethical path.\n\n236\n00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.870\nAnd there are key reasons\nassociated with this.\n\n237\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.970\nYou can get in real trouble,\nreal legal trouble.\n\n238\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.690\nEven though you're not breaking laws,\nyou could still get into\n\n239\n00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.280\nreal legal trouble if you don't\ngo down the ethical path.\n\n240\n00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.955\nAnd people are not gonna like you.\n\n241\n00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:51.474\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have enough bad guys out\nthere, so use your intelligence,\n\n242\n00:13:51.474 --> 00:13:53.060\nuse your superpower for good.\n\n243\n00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.190\nI know that sounds cliche or\na little cheesy, but it's the truth.\n\n244\n00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.810\nThat's what we really want to see\nyou using your intelligence in\n\n245\n00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.060\nthe right way to help others.\n\n246\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.220\n&gt;&gt; So this next slide talks about\nethical behavior requirements.\n\n247\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.042\nCourage.\n\n248\n00:14:07.042 --> 00:14:12.050\nIf you see something and\nit's wrong, say it.\n\n249\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.724\nIdentify, face the realities.\n\n250\n00:14:13.724 --> 00:14:17.620\nThe realities is that this person\nis not behaving ethically.\n\n251\n00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.441\nLet him know,\n\n252\n00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:23.237\nbecause they may not realize that their\nbehavior is impacting people improperly.\n\n253\n00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:25.013\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and a lot of your schools and\n\n254\n00:14:25.013 --> 00:14:28.144\neven jobs will have these things\ncalled open door policies.\n\n255\n00:14:28.144 --> 00:14:30.983\nBecause I had a friend,\nshe used to always tell me, doing\n\n256\n00:14:30.983 --> 00:14:35.203\nwhat's right isn't always what's easy,\nand that couldn't be more true, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:35.203 --> 00:14:38.196\nSometimes it does take this courage,\nlike Steve's saying, to go ahead and\n\n258\n00:14:38.196 --> 00:14:39.600\ndo what is right.\n\n259\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.240\n&gt;&gt; And the next one here is be willing to\ngo against your friends and your peers.\n\n260\n00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.980\nAgain, that takes courage, right?\n\n261\n00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.850\nJust as you said.\n\n262\n00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.030\nAnd then stand up to bullies.\n\n263\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.020\nWe've had discussions\nrelative to bullying.\n\n264\n00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.060\nBut stand up,\n\n265\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.390\nlet them know what they're doing is wrong,\nbecause they may not realize it.\n\n266\n00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:57.780\nThey may not realize it.\n\n267\n00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:04.680\nAnd humility, even you can make\na wrong decision, we all have.\n\n268\n00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.200\nAnd guess what, you will again.\n\n269\n00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.750\nIt's just human nature.\n\n270\n00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.220\n&gt;&gt; I like the next question.\n\n271\n00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.760\nAre you a better than an average driver?\n\n272\n00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.280\nNormally, I would say no.\n\n273\n00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.191\nBut here in Gainesville, Florida,\nI think I might be little bit better than\n\n274\n00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:23.045\nthe average driver, but\nthat's my humble opinion [LAUGH].\n\n275\n00:15:23.045 --> 00:15:24.990\nWhat does that mean in\nthe grand scheme of things?\n\n276\n00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.350\nNot too much, really [LAUGH].\n\n277\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.821\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure if you asked 100 people,\nare you better than the average driver,\n\n278\n00:15:30.821 --> 00:15:33.746\nabout 90 of them would say that they are,\nwhich.\n\n279\n00:15:33.746 --> 00:15:35.858\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is, right, and\n\n280\n00:15:35.858 --> 00:15:37.720\nit's a human nature.\n\n281\n00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.694\nWe don't do sometimes a very\ngood job of judging ourselves.\n\n282\n00:15:40.694 --> 00:15:41.218\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n283\n00:15:41.218 --> 00:15:43.130\n&gt;&gt; But be humble.\n\n284\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.810\nAnd are you more ethical\nthan the average person?\n\n285\n00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.540\nAgain, probably if we got.\n\n286\n00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.200\n&gt;&gt; What's average?\n\n287\n00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.408\n&gt;&gt; 100 people, yeah.\n\n288\n00:15:49.408 --> 00:15:50.943\n&gt;&gt; 100 people in the room,\n\n289\n00:15:50.943 --> 00:15:55.030\nmore than 50% would say that\nthey're better than average.\n\n290\n00:15:55.030 --> 00:16:00.010\nTruth is that a lot of it comes from our\n\n291\n00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:05.030\nrecognition that we are no better or\nno worse than everybody else,\n\n292\n00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.530\nand so we deserve to be treated\nlike we would treat everybody else.\n\n293\n00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.720\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nI'll let you guys in on a little secret.\n\n294\n00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.159\nNo one likes the egotistical individual.\n\n295\n00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:17.568\nThey might be friends with them, but\nthey really don't like them [LAUGH].\n\n296\n00:16:17.568 --> 00:16:22.649\nSo being humble and having that\nhumility is gonna get you a lot further\n\n297\n00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:28.795\nthan always being completely overconfident\nand undermining other's thoughts.\n\n298\n00:16:28.795 --> 00:16:31.115\n&gt;&gt; This has me thinking\nabout the politicians.\n\n299\n00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:34.700\nI don't know why I'm thinking about them,\nbut recent elections have\n\n300\n00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.745\ndemonstrated that humility for\npoliticians pretty much is out the door.\n\n301\n00:16:38.745 --> 00:16:41.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's sad.\n\n302\n00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is sad.\n\n303\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:48.610\nSo there are some questions, and\nwe'll talk briefly about each of them.\n\n304\n00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.244\nDoes the Internet make it easier or\nharder to act ethically?\n\n305\n00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:53.510\nWhat do you think?\n\n306\n00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.990\nI think it could be both ways, Steve.\n\n307\n00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.760\nI think for a lot of people,\nlike we spoke about previously,\n\n308\n00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.365\nthe anonymity gives them, they lose their\nmorals when they have that anonymity.\n\n309\n00:17:03.365 --> 00:17:08.033\nBut also, the internet is such a great\nthing, because people who normally\n\n310\n00:17:08.033 --> 00:17:13.532\nwouldn't have access to free education or\nmonetary improvements, they do have that.\n\n311\n00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:17.892\nAnd it's a venue for them to maybe\nunderstand or read about ethics and\n\n312\n00:17:17.892 --> 00:17:21.840\nto gain that knowledge, so\nit's a double edged sword there.\n\n313\n00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.360\n&gt;&gt; Next question, is it easier or\n\n314\n00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.000\nharder to do the right thing\nwhen others are watching?\n\n315\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:29.425\nHmm.\n&gt;&gt; Hmm.\n\n316\n00:17:29.425 --> 00:17:33.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's not always about\ntrying to impress someone, but\n\n317\n00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.590\nmaybe just doing what's true to yourself.\n\n318\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:40.570\nSo again, that's definitely a good\nquestion to look at and think about.\n\n319\n00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:41.800\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen the final question on this slide.\n\n320\n00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.660\nIs it easier or\n\n321\n00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:48.070\nharder to do the right thing when it means\nthat you have to choose between friends?\n\n322\n00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.390\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be harder.\n\n323\n00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's clearly harder.\n\n324\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yep.\n\n325\n00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and then this is\nthe final slide in the series, and\n\n326\n00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.820\nthese are the do nots and the dos.\n\n327\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.680\nThat we earlier had a list of\nprinciples of cyber ethics.\n\n328\n00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.980\nThe 10 Commandments, more or less.\n\n329\n00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.590\nAnd the do nots are do not use your\ncomputer to harm other people,\n\n330\n00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:12.910\nwe could go through each one of these, but\nyou might take a moment and read them.\n\n331\n00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:17.930\nI'll do the do's,\nbecause I do think about the social\n\n332\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:23.350\nconsequences of the program you are\nwriting and the system you are designing.\n\n333\n00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:24.750\nSo do think about this,\n\n334\n00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:30.040\nand your thoughts should help you\nto guide to the correct decision.\n\n335\n00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.240\nAnd do you always use computers in ways\nthat will ensure consideration and\n\n336\n00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.700\nrespect for your fellow human beings?\n\n337\n00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.470\nSo this pretty much lays out\nthe principles and ethics.\n\n338\n00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.970\nI hope you gained an understanding of it.\n\n339\n00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.995\nAnd so, a good place to stop, I think.\n\n340\n00:18:45.995 --> 00:18:47.814\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI think that just about wraps it up for\n\n341\n00:18:47.814 --> 00:18:50.330\nthis episode\n&gt;&gt; I don't want you guys to go anywhere\n\n342\n00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.560\nbecause we have actual current events\nthat we would like you to think about,\n\n343\n00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.000\nand we'll go through together.\n\n344\n00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.580\nAnd then,\nwe'll also be looking at some scenarios.\n\n345\n00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.820\nSo stay tuned, we have some more\nCyberPatriot coming your way.\n\n346\n00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.680\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n347\n00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.540\n&gt;&gt; And I'm professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n348\n00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.360\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time\nhere at CyberPatriot.\n\n349\n00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:16.236\n[MUSIC]\n\n350\n00:19:16.236 --> 00:19:17.945\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPRO.TV\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, cyber patriots,\n\n5\n00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:15.960\nto another online training video.\n\n6\n00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.300\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.050\nThis is an interesting episode.\n\n8\n00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.830\nWe're actually gonna be doing\nan interactive study here.\n\n9\n00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.966\nWe want to go ahead and\ntake a look at some current events and\n\n10\n00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:29.491\nI'll have Professor Steve Linthicum\nexplain the format for us.\n\n11\n00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:31.346\nThank you for being here today, Steve.\n\n12\n00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:36.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, well basically, what we're\ngonna do is we're going to show a slide\n\n13\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.530\nthat identifies the current event and\nthen Cherokee's gonna read it.\n\n14\n00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.990\nAnd from there, we're gonna go through and\nI'm gonna ask a couple of questions.\n\n15\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.870\nYou're gonna think about them, and\nthen Cherokee and I will discuss them.\n\n16\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.010\nSo that's kinda the scenario.\n\n17\n00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.800\nDoes that make sense?\n\n18\n00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.430\n&gt;&gt; That does.\n\n19\n00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.900\nSo let's go ahead and get started then.\n\n20\n00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.360\nAnd if we take a look at my screen here,\nthis is actually an article.\n\n21\n00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.070\nThis is from slate.com.\n\n22\n00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.870\nSo if you guys wanna go ahead and\ncheck this out, feel free.\n\n23\n00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.195\nAnd I'll just kinda brief you on\nwhat this article states here.\n\n24\n00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:13.460\nTerry Childs was a 43-year-old network\nengineer for the city of San Francisco,\n\n25\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.530\nand he worked on a fiber optic network,\nand R meaning the city of San Francisco.\n\n26\n00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.875\nAnd that fiber optic network was\ncalled FiberWAN which handled crucial\n\n27\n00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:27.745\ngovernment data such as e-mail,\nlegal documents and payroll information.\n\n28\n00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:31.315\nAnd by most accounts,\nhe was a diligent and talented employee.\n\n29\n00:01:31.315 --> 00:01:34.960\nHe seemed dedicated to making\nsure the systems ran safely.\n\n30\n00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.120\nChilds spent hours trying to\nperfect the FiberWAN system.\n\n31\n00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.050\nHe would upgrade equipment and\ninstall firewalls, and\n\n32\n00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.800\nin the summer of 2008\nChild's was re-assigned.\n\n33\n00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.770\nAnd when he was instructed to hand over\nthe password that he had created for\n\n34\n00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.180\nthe wide area network,\nthe FiberWAN, he refused.\n\n35\n00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.805\nNo one could get into the network\nwithout that password.\n\n36\n00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:58.640\nThe emails were inaccessible,\npayroll couldn't go out, and\n\n37\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.110\ndocuments were under virtual lock and key.\n\n38\n00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.760\nThe city was in crisis.\n\n39\n00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.150\nWe had to have the code at that time.\n\n40\n00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.030\nSo at that particular point in time,\nthe city of San Fransisco spent at\n\n41\n00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.570\nleast $1 million dollars including hiring\na team as Cisco Systems to crack the code.\n\n42\n00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.570\nBut they couldn't get into the system.\n\n43\n00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.740\nThey had no choice but\nto compel him to give up the password.\n\n44\n00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.700\nSo the police arrested Childs on a charge\nof felony computer tampering and\n\n45\n00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.810\nput him in jail, but\nhe still wouldn't give up the code, wow.\n\n46\n00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.190\nI was as honest as I could be.\n\n47\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.692\nAnd this is coming from that article, so\nI'm not talking in the first person here\n\n48\n00:02:36.692 --> 00:02:41.850\nand I'm pulling that quote,\nasking him to give the code as a favor.\n\n49\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.625\nAnd if nothing else, he responded.\n\n50\n00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:48.170\nChilds said he didn't trust his bosses or\ncolleagues.\n\n51\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.470\nAnd at that moment,\nhe had trusted the article author here,\n\n52\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.030\nand he wrote down the code.\n\n53\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.640\nThere were 28 numbers and letters,\nand he eventually handed it over.\n\n54\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.356\nBut it really did take some coaxing and\n\n55\n00:03:01.356 --> 00:03:05.650\nobviously an arrest for\nhim to hand that code over.\n\n56\n00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's switch over and\n\n57\n00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.410\nwe'll look at the questions\nthat are up on my screen.\n\n58\n00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.840\nShould Terry Childs have been arrested?\n\n59\n00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n60\n00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n61\n00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.570\n&gt;&gt; So do I.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I mean, you're an employee.\n\n62\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.730\nYou're hired to do a job.\n\n63\n00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.470\nHe obviously did his job and\nhe did it well.\n\n64\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.120\nBut you're still an employee and\nyou do have that obligation.\n\n65\n00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.340\nIt's not your intellectual\nproperty like you told us about.\n\n66\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n67\n00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.170\nWell, and in point of fact,\nhe was actually arrested and\n\n68\n00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.470\nconvicted, convicted by\na jury of his peers.\n\n69\n00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.980\nSo it's pretty obvious\nthat his behaviors were\n\n70\n00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.690\nnot only unethical,\nthey were unlawful, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.150\nSo which principles of cyber ethics\ndid Terry Childs violate, if any?\n\n72\n00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.880\nWhat do you think?\n\n73\n00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.010\n&gt;&gt; Well, if he violated his\ncorporate security policy by\n\n74\n00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.880\nnot handing over that password.\n\n75\n00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.100\nAnd then if he was, in fact, convicted,\n\n76\n00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.680\nthat usually indicates that he\nwas violating a law as well.\n\n77\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.720\nSo at least those two that I can think of.\n\n78\n00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so which principles of cyber\nethics did Terry Childs violate?\n\n79\n00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.619\nLook at this list and form in your\nown mind what you think he violated.\n\n80\n00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.370\n&gt;&gt; He wasn't harming anyone.\n\n81\n00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.640\nWas he interfering with other\npeople's compute systems?\n\n82\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.930\nDefinitely, he was.\n\n83\n00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.460\nIt wasn't his.\n\n84\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.720\nHe didn't own that network, right?\n\n85\n00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.590\nWhat else do we have here?\n\n86\n00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.500\nDo not snoop.\n\n87\n00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.531\nI don't know,\nit doesn't really go into detail.\n\n88\n00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:42.540\nI don't think he was really snooping here.\n\n89\n00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.550\nDo not use a computer to steal.\n\n90\n00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.670\nIt never indicates that he\nwas trying to steal anything.\n\n91\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.170\nWhat does the next one say there?\n\n92\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.610\n&gt;&gt; Do not use a computer\nto bear false witness.\n\n93\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.330\nNo, I don't think that one was it either.\n\n94\n00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.160\n&gt;&gt; Do not copy or\nuse proprietary software-\n\n95\n00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.830\n&gt;&gt; Software without-\n\n96\n00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.720\n&gt;&gt; Without paying for it.\n\n97\n00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.010\nIt wasn't that obviously.\n\n98\n00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.100\nDo not use other people's computer\nresources without authorization or\n\n99\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.375\nproper compensation.\n\n100\n00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:12.650\nYeah, that falls under that\ncategory there because again,\n\n101\n00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.900\nit wasn't his equipment,\nhis networking equipment.\n\n102\n00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.820\n&gt;&gt; Well, and\nhe didn't have the authorization.\n\n103\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.620\n&gt;&gt; Right, they were in fact trying to\nget him to relinquish the information\n\n104\n00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.390\nthat he did have.\n\n105\n00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.310\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n106\n00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.280\nAnd one of the things with\nregard to authorization,\n\n107\n00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.127\nmake sure that that\nauthorization is in writing.\n\n108\n00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:30.782\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's always a key component because,\n\n109\n00:05:30.782 --> 00:05:31.548\nguess what?\n\n110\n00:05:31.548 --> 00:05:34.943\nMemories fail and\nyou may be called on the carpet, and\n\n111\n00:05:34.943 --> 00:05:38.560\nit would be nice to have\npermissions in writing.\n\n112\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.870\n&gt;&gt; Always.\n&gt;&gt; If there is a question as to whether or\n\n113\n00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.260\nnot you had permission or not.\n\n114\n00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.010\nLet me see, what else do we have.\n\n115\n00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.660\nThe final one is, do not appropriate\nother people's intellectual output.\n\n116\n00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we can see that he's\ndefinitely disobeying some of\n\n117\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.030\nthose commandments there.\n\n118\n00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n119\n00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.400\n&gt;&gt; So in this particular current event,\n\n120\n00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.290\nwe can see the actions and\nthe consequences of Terry Childs.\n\n121\n00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.660\nAnd I'd like you guys to think\nabout if that was a fair and\n\n122\n00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.750\njust punishment for this individual.\n\n123\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.810\nBut stay tuned.\n\n124\n00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.580\nWe do have some more current events that\nwe would like you to think about as well.\n\n125\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.200\nSo I am your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n126\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.670\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n127\n00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.719\n&gt;&gt; See you next time\nhere at Cyber Patriot.\n\n128\n00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:27.433\n[MUSIC]\n\n129\n00:06:27.433 --> 00:06:29.385\n&gt;&gt;

Thank you for inviting me.\n\n12\n00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Your welcome.\n\n13\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.236\nSo what kind of current event\nwill we be looking at here?\n\n14\n00:00:38.236 --> 00:00:41.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is, how can I describe it?\n\n15\n00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.190\nThis is an event that involves animals and\nthe situation where you don't\n\n16\n00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.840\nrealize you're on camera, I guess,\nwould be the best way to describe it.\n\n17\n00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, earlier you had asked\na question about is it easier to perform\n\n18\n00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.900\nethically when someone's watching or\nwhen you're alone?\n\n19\n00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.720\nSo this is definitely a situation\nthat falls under this realm.\n\n20\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.250\nAnd I'll go ahead and\n\n21\n00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.060\ntell you guys a little bit about\nthis particular situation.\n\n22\n00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.060\nThe CEO of Centerplate which is a catering\ncompany that serves food at sports stadium\n\n23\n00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.560\naround the country, was caught on camera\nkicking a dog in a Vancouver elevator.\n\n24\n00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.190\nAnd if we take a look at my screen,\nwe can see the article here,\n\n25\n00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.650\nthis is from Fortune.com.\n\n26\n00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.620\nAnd I'll scroll down here a little bit.\n\n27\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.740\nAnd just a few more details, after issuing\na public apology, Desmond Hague agreed\n\n28\n00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.198\nto attend anger management counseling,\nserve 1,000 hours of community service,\n\n29\n00:01:34.198 --> 00:01:40.670\nand donate $100,000 of his own\nmoney to an animal charity.\n\n30\n00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.670\nLess than one week later,\nhe was forced to resign.\n\n31\n00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.880\nFrom all the other metrics, Mr.\nHague was a good CEO.\n\n32\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.780\nHis company grew and\nprofited while he was running the company.\n\n33\n00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.990\nSo here we see a particular action and\nthe consequence.\n\n34\n00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.098\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so looking at this situation.\n\n35\n00:02:02.098 --> 00:02:06.800\nAnd we're are challenged with a question\nhere, that's up on the slide.\n\n36\n00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.100\nIt says, should Mr.\nHague have been forced to resign?\n\n37\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.660\nSo what do you think?\n\n38\n00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.880\nThis is a tough one because it seems like\nhe really was making a conscious effort\n\n39\n00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.980\nto go ahead and rectify his behavior.\n\n40\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.230\nSo, what happened here?\n\n41\n00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.630\nHe attended anger management courses,\nhe had a 1000 hour of community service,\n\n42\n00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.630\nand he donated $100,000\nto an animal charity.\n\n43\n00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.530\nWhat's interesting,\n\n44\n00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.365\nwhen I looked at the article that you had\nposted, there's a football stadium there.\n\n45\n00:02:40.365 --> 00:02:43.290\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And this brings to mind and\n\n46\n00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.330\nmaybe it brought to mind the editors\nof this particular newspaper,\n\n47\n00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.010\nis the Michael Vick case where it-\n&gt;&gt; Sure, high profile.\n\n48\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.638\n&gt;&gt; Dealt with animals.\n\n49\n00:02:50.638 --> 00:02:55.294\nAs a high profile individual, he didn't\nrealize that the activities he was\n\n50\n00:02:55.294 --> 00:02:59.965\ninvolved in, and I think it related\nto dog fighting, something like that?\n\n51\n00:02:59.965 --> 00:03:02.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pitbull fighting.\n\n52\n00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.570\n&gt;&gt; He went to jail, he lost his job.\n\n53\n00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.220\n&gt;&gt; His employment, sure, in the NFL,\nthat's a big paycheck, right?\n\n54\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.757\n&gt;&gt; And eventually he did make\nhis way back in the NFL.\n\n55\n00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:17.032\nBut I am sure that we prize our animals,\nwe prize the consequences associated with\n\n56\n00:03:17.032 --> 00:03:22.540\nthem, after all they're pretty much\ndefenseless to human being behaviors.\n\n57\n00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.300\nAnd so in my mind I think that\nfrom an ethical standpoint,\n\n58\n00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.280\nand from probably a legal standpoint,\nbecause he may well have,\n\n59\n00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.730\nin terms of this, violated laws\nrelating to the cruelty to animals.\n\n60\n00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.190\nSo I think that it's a good decision that\nhe was forced to resign, public pressure.\n\n61\n00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.510\nHe's representing his company.\n\n62\n00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.950\nAnd this is certainly not what his\ncompany's stockholders wanted,\n\n63\n00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.100\nwas a CEO who is kicking animals.\n\n64\n00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.500\n&gt;&gt; Right, especially even for\njust the company image.\n\n65\n00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.733\nNot taking it past that point\nof if it was right or wrong,\n\n66\n00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.025\nbecause other people are gonna\nhave their own opinions.\n\n67\n00:03:56.025 --> 00:04:00.791\nAnd personally, I feel like whether it be\nanimals, whether it be the elderly, or\n\n68\n00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:04.523\nindividuals with disabilities,\nyou should really go above and\n\n69\n00:04:04.523 --> 00:04:08.550\nbeyond to protect people or\nanimals who cannot protect themselves.\n\n70\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.131\nAnd, of course,\nnot the opposite of that, so.\n\n71\n00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:12.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n72\n00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, thank you guys so\nmuch for tuning in for this Current Event.\n\n73\n00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.370\nI want you to go ahead and\ntake some time to think about, if you felt\n\n74\n00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.710\nthat the justification, the punishment was\nfitting for this particular crime here.\n\n75\n00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.260\nSo we will go ahead and\nsee you in the next Current Event.\n\n76\n00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.180\nWe've got one more, so don't go anywhere.\n\n77\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.720\nThank you for tuning in.\n\n78\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.730\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n79\n00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.125\n&gt;&gt; And I'm professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n80\n00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:38.946\n&gt;&gt; See you next time for Cyber Patriot.\n\n81\n00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:47.448\n[MUSIC]\n\n82\n00:04:47.448 --> 00:04:49.590\n&gt;&gt;

And thank you for inviting me.\n\n13\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.870\nWhat we're gonna do here is\nthere's gonna be a scenario.\n\n14\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.740\nAnd then you're gonna be asked to identify\n\n15\n00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.950\nin a multiple choice sort of fashion\nwhat you believe the correct answer is.\n\n16\n00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.640\nSo let's go to the first scenario.\n\n17\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880\n&gt;&gt; Sure,\nlet's take a look at this first scenario.\n\n18\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.900\nHack or no hack?\n\n19\n00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.450\nIn this particular scenario,\n\n20\n00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.500\nEmily posted a picture of your\nfriend Jayden on Instagram.\n\n21\n00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.200\nThe picture makes it look as if\nJayden is consuming alcohol but\n\n22\n00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.610\nyou know that he wasn't.\n\n23\n00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.310\nYour friend Jayden is very upset.\n\n24\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.890\nAnd Emily refuses to\ntake down the picture.\n\n25\n00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.860\nJayden asks for\n\n26\n00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.740\nyour help in getting into Emily's\nInstagram account to remove the picture.\n\n27\n00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.580\nWhat should you do?\n\n28\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.990\nGood question.\n\n29\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.350\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat our options that we have here.\n\n30\n00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.670\nThis is a multiple choice and\nthis is where we wanna go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.230\nhave you think about this.\n\n32\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.790\nSo go ahead and pause your computer,\npause this video.\n\n33\n00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.320\nTake a minute to look at these answers and\nwe'll come back and talk about them.\n\n34\n00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.980\nSo go ahead and hit pause now.\n\n35\n00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.780\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n36\n00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.940\nI hope you had enough time to go ahead and\nlook at these particular answers.\n\n37\n00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.690\nLet's go ahead and\ndiscuss what is the correct answer and\n\n38\n00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.450\nsee if it aligns with what you chose.\n\n39\n00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.140\nSo Steve what do you think?\n\n40\n00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.800\n&gt;&gt; Well my hope is that the students\nout there picked answer B.\n\n41\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.870\nThe other answers.\n\n42\n00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.320\nWell first of all,\nyou don't have a right to break in\n\n43\n00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.630\nto Emily's account even if you\nknow what the password is.\n\n44\n00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.490\nAnd that's obvious to me.\n\n45\n00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.160\nIt should be obvious to most of you.\n\n46\n00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.750\nSo the bottom line is that answer B\nprovides us with a vehicle that allows.\n\n47\n00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.870\nThe harmed party here,\nyour friend Jayden to contact\n\n48\n00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.680\nthe company where the picture is at.\n\n49\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.350\nAnd explain the situation to them and let\nthem make an independent decision as to\n\n50\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.010\nwhether or\nnot that picture should be taken down.\n\n51\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.080\nI'm sure based upon these facts and\ncircumstances that,\n\n52\n00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.460\nin this case I think it's Instagram would\norder that the picture be taken down.\n\n53\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you never really\nknow with these companies.\n\n54\n00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.240\nSometimes it may or may not violate\ntheir rights or their terms of service.\n\n55\n00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.400\nSo you definitely wanna check on that.\n\n56\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.410\nAnd of course like Steve said, you never\nwant to hack into someone’s account.\n\n57\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.520\nYou obviously without any kind of\nauthorization like you mentioned on\n\n58\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.600\nthe previous show.\n\n59\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.758\nWe always want to get in black and white.\n\n60\n00:02:56.758 --> 00:03:01.980\nBut I did notice which one was it,\ndown here at the bottom for\n\n61\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.700\noption D there's an important note.\n\n62\n00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.620\nAnd this is just maybe coming\nfrom the parenting side I\n\n63\n00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.660\nmean the mom side coming out here.\n\n64\n00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.010\nBut I did want to point this out so\nno we're not gonna choose D as the answer.\n\n65\n00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.700\nBut do keep in mind that even\nthough you may be standing\n\n66\n00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.560\nnext to some alcoholic beverages and\nthough although you're not consuming them.\n\n67\n00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.290\nYou should remain aware of the fact that\nan outsider might not understand that.\n\n68\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.880\nSo you kind of do put\nyourself in situations and\n\n69\n00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.570\nyou don't want to let your guard down.\n\n70\n00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.830\nSo you do kind of have to be\nfamiliar with your environment,\n\n71\n00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.790\nbut don't choose that as the answer.\n\n72\n00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.060\nBut just keep that in mind.\n\n73\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.190\nSide note.\n[LAUGH] And\n\n74\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.583\nthat's all I have for that one.\n\n75\n00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:45.849\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and another quick note is there's\na comment in answer D that things stay on\n\n76\n00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.600\nthe Internet forever.\n\n77\n00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.660\nSo just because you're capable of getting\nit taken off of that particular site\n\n78\n00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.130\ndoesn't mean that it might\nnot be somewhere else.\n\n79\n00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.832\nSomewhere where you may find it or\nnot find it.\n\n80\n00:03:57.832 --> 00:04:00.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that about wraps it up for\nscenario one.\n\n81\n00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.600\nWe don't want you to go anywhere,\n\n82\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.320\nwe have some other scenarios that\nwe'd like you to take a look at.\n\n83\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.070\nSo stay tuned,\nwe have more scenarios headed your way.\n\n84\n00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.170\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n85\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.700\n&gt;&gt;

Bullying, yes.\n\n14\n00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:37.071\nAnd I think we already discussed bullying\nin great details in an earlier module if\n\n15\n00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:38.844\nmy memory serves me correct.\n\n16\n00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:39.743\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's correct.\n\n17\n00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:42.545\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so let's go to the first scenario.\n\n18\n00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:45.765\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'll go ahead and\nread that for you and we can go ahead and\n\n19\n00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:47.293\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n20\n00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:49.935\nScenario number 2; Bullies.\n\n21\n00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:52.945\nYou and your friends\nare playing an online game and\n\n22\n00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:57.425\na classmate, Alex, is logging on and\nbreaking the rules.\n\n23\n00:00:57.425 --> 00:01:01.465\nAlex's obnoxious behavior is making\nit very difficult for you and\n\n24\n00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:02.805\nyour friends to enjoy the game.\n\n25\n00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:05.960\nYou have reported him\nto the game publisher,\n\n26\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.860\nbut he keeps creating new accounts and\nharassing you.\n\n27\n00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.640\nYou recently found a tool on the Internet\nthat allows you to remove a person's\n\n28\n00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.490\ncomputer from the game temporarily.\n\n29\n00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.760\nThe website where you found the tool says\n\n30\n00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.310\nthat it doesn't cause\nany long term damage.\n\n31\n00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.550\nWhat should you do?\n\n32\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.870\nAll right,\nlet's take a look at our options here.\n\n33\n00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.310\nAgain, we have another multiple choice.\n\n34\n00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.350\nI'm gonna ask you to go ahead,\nread through each one of these answers,\n\n35\n00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.970\nand try to come up with the best decision.\n\n36\n00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.340\nSo go ahead and hit pause,\ngive yourself some time to read those.\n\n37\n00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.913\nAnd we'll come right back and\ndiscuss the proper answer.\n\n38\n00:01:48.138 --> 00:01:52.240\nAll right, you should have had enough\ntime to go ahead and make your selection.\n\n39\n00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.360\nLet's go ahead and switch on over to\nSteve and see what he has to say and\n\n40\n00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.130\nhow he weighs in on this particular topic.\n\n41\n00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.930\nWhat do you think Steve?\n\n42\n00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.690\nWhat should we do in this\nsituation with our bully?\n\n43\n00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, first of all there's\na bit of a red herring here.\n\n44\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.510\nAnd that is associated with the fact\nthat in the question or in the scenario,\n\n45\n00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.180\nthere is an indication, and if my memory\nserves me, it's correct that the website\n\n46\n00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.870\nwhere you downloaded it from said it\nwouldn't harm anything for a long term.\n\n47\n00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.820\n&gt;&gt; Well, that must be true.\n\n48\n00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.370\nIt's on the Internet.\n\n49\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's on the Internet.\n\n50\n00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.190\n&gt;&gt; Everything on the Internet is true,\nright?\n\n51\n00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, everything's true, right?\n\n52\n00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.148\n&gt;&gt; That's sarcasm.\n\n53\n00:02:23.148 --> 00:02:24.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n54\n00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n55\n00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.060\nthe correct answer here is clearly C.\n\n56\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.590\nYou look at the standards of conduct and\ncomplaint procedures for the game.\n\n57\n00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.560\nSo there's a process here.\n\n58\n00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.790\nThe game manufacturer, the game creator,\nhas created a process for specific issues.\n\n59\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.790\nYou tell your parents or another adult\nabout Alex's harassment, and ask them to\n\n60\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.080\nhelp you to report the inappropriate\nbehavior that's going on here.\n\n61\n00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.380\nAnd the bottom line is,\nparticularly for younger people,\n\n62\n00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.920\nyour criticism of his behavior may\nnot be as, how can I describe it?\n\n63\n00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.510\nAs believed unless you get an adult\ninvolved [INAUDIBLE] to report it.\n\n64\n00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could just say,\nhe's picking on me.\n\n65\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; He doesn't like me.\n\n66\n00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And the adults,\n\n67\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.460\nsomeone might not believe you that he\nactually has created five different\n\n68\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.110\naccounts with different user names to\ngo ahead and bother you an pester you.\n\n69\n00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.070\nAnd as it seems like an easy fix,\nan easy solution, remember what we said,\n\n70\n00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.120\ndoing what's right is not always\nthe same thing as doing what's easy.\n\n71\n00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.950\nSo, although that website says there's\nnothing that could harm that computer,\n\n72\n00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.350\nyou never know if there's\nany kind of backdoor or\n\n73\n00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.360\nTrojan installed in that piece software,\nor that tool that you're using,\n\n74\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.010\nto prevent that bully from\naccessing that games.\n\n75\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.480\nSo we definitely remember if we can back\nto our ten commandments there, we're not\n\n76\n00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.040\ntrying to cause harm on any one especially\neven their computer equipment here.\n\n77\n00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, but, again,\ngetting back to the issue here,\n\n78\n00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.720\nbullying is sometimes hard to define.\n\n79\n00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.500\nAnd so you're bringing a parent or\nan adult along with you.\n\n80\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, having that role model,\nthat parent figure.\n\n81\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, relative to whether or\nnot the complaint is appropriate.\n\n82\n00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.566\nAnd in this case, it's not just you\nsaying that he is bullying, it's an adult\n\n83\n00:04:18.566 --> 00:04:23.440\nwho is not playing the game but recognizes\nthe activities that are going on.\n\n84\n00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.887\nThat can helps supplement your complaints.\n\n85\n00:04:25.887 --> 00:04:26.746\n&gt;&gt; Substantiate it, essentially.\n\n86\n00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:28.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, substantiate it.\n\n87\n00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n88\n00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.480\n&gt;&gt; So, I think that about does it here for\nscenario 2.\n\n89\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.730\nDefinitely gives you\nsomething to think about.\n\n90\n00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.620\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ncontinue, so don't go anywhere.\n\n91\n00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.030\nI appreciate you guys hanging in there so\nstay tuned.\n\n92\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.780\nWe have more CyberPatriot scenarios\nheaded your way, and I'm your host,\n\n93\n00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.700\nCherokee Boose.\n\n94\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.007\n&gt;&gt;

Sure, all right, let's take a look\nat the screen, and here we have Sophia.\n\n20\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.330\nIt's Sophia's first day as an intern\nin a computer security firm,and she and\n\n21\n00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.570\nher supervisor, Christopher, walk by\nanother intern's computer workstation.\n\n22\n00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.490\nThe workstation has not\nbeen locked down and\n\n23\n00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.050\nthey notice that the browser is currently\nopened to the user's banking website.\n\n24\n00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.690\nChristopher, is a well-respected person\nin the firm, but he's a bit of practical\n\n25\n00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.110\njoker, and decides to play a joke on\nthis person's unsecured computer.\n\n26\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.750\nHe logs out of the banking\nwebsite to protect the user and\n\n27\n00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.892\nthen proceeds to change the computer\ndesktop background to kitten images.\n\n28\n00:01:38.892 --> 00:01:39.415\nYeay.\n\n29\n00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:44.840\n[LAUGH] Sophia feels uncomfortable\nabout what Christopher is doing,\n\n30\n00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.940\nand asks if his actions are a good idea?\n\n31\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.620\nHe states, nah, it's not a big deal,\nbesides it'll teach him a lesson.\n\n32\n00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.070\nShe laughs and says, okay, then we should\nmake the background My Little Ponies.\n\n33\n00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.465\nChristopher locks down the station,\nand he and Sophia step aside and\n\n34\n00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:04.144\nwait to see what happens.\n\n35\n00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:06.372\nAll right, there's the scenario.\n\n36\n00:02:06.372 --> 00:02:11.170\nSo, let's go ahead and\ngive you a moment to read through this.\n\n37\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.050\nSo go ahead and pause this video.\n\n38\n00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.550\nWe're gonna come back and go through each\none of these questions individually.\n\n39\n00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.051\nSo go ahead and hit pause now.\n\n40\n00:02:21.673 --> 00:02:24.502\nAll right, hopefully you had\nenough time to go through and\n\n41\n00:02:24.502 --> 00:02:26.430\nread the individual questions.\n\n42\n00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.510\nIf we look at the first question here,\nit says, have Sophia and\n\n43\n00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.310\nChris acted ethically?\n\n44\n00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.990\nWhy or why not?\n\n45\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.090\nSo what do you think, Steve?\n\n46\n00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.720\nWhat did Sophia and Chris do here?\n\n47\n00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.414\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think, first of all,\none thing comes to mind.\n\n48\n00:02:40.414 --> 00:02:44.420\nAnd that is, when we read the scenario,\nthey're at a security firm.\n\n49\n00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.511\nSo there ought to probably be\na policy in effect that defines what\n\n50\n00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:51.936\nhappens when an employee\nleaves their workstation.\n\n51\n00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:53.469\n&gt;&gt; Like locking their workstation?\n\n52\n00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:54.815\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like locking their workstation.\n\n53\n00:02:54.815 --> 00:02:58.180\nAnd what are the consequences for\nthat failure to do so?\n\n54\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.930\nAs to whether or\nnot they acted ethically or not.\n\n55\n00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.090\nWell maybe there is a policy in\nplace that makes it ethical,\n\n56\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.870\nby simply saying, if you walk by\na workstation and another employee has\n\n57\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.080\nleft their workstation unlocked,\nyou need to do something.\n\n58\n00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.870\nPerhaps change the background, and\nthen lock it and report that situation.\n\n59\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.633\nIn that case, clearly ethically.\n\n60\n00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:28.070\nBut I just don't think that\nthat policy is out there.\n\n61\n00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.920\nWhat they've really done is,\nthey've Mickey Moused around and\n\n62\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.996\naffected somebody's desktop.\n\n63\n00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:34.280\n&gt;&gt; Playing a joke on someone.\n\n64\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.070\nAnd I actually have to say,\nthis has happened to me in real life.\n\n65\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.910\nI ended up with, I asked someone\nto lock my computer, because here\n\n66\n00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.910\nat ITProTV we had recording studios, and\nI didn't wanna interrupt a recording.\n\n67\n00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.020\nSo I kind of hand motioned to someone,\nto go ahead and lock my computer.\n\n68\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.310\nI had stepped away for a moment, and\nshame on me, should have hit lock there.\n\n69\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.020\nBut, when I came back the next morning,\nI had Backstreet Boys as my desktop.\n\n70\n00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.080\nSo, can this sort of situation be\nrealistic in a work environment?\n\n71\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.820\nYes it can.\n\n72\n00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.300\nSo that's why we're discussing this,\nso you know how to go ahead and\n\n73\n00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.260\napproach it appropriately.\n\n74\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.550\nThe next question,\nlet's go ahead and take a look at.\n\n75\n00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.681\nIt says, the intern returns, unlocks\nhis station, and becomes visibly upset.\n\n76\n00:04:15.681 --> 00:04:18.276\nHe logs back into his banking site and\n\n77\n00:04:18.276 --> 00:04:22.810\nfuriously begins looking\nat his transaction history.\n\n78\n00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.450\nSophia notices that he looks upset,\napproaches the intern, and apologizes for\n\n79\n00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.380\nwhat had happened and assures him\nthat nothing malicious happened.\n\n80\n00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.630\nThe intern is initially irritated but\nthen tells her it's okay.\n\n81\n00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.410\nHe was just initially scared and\n\n82\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.670\nwas worried about someone\nstealing his banking information.\n\n83\n00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.808\nDoes the intern's acceptance\nof the joke excul-\n\n84\n00:04:44.808 --> 00:04:46.221\n&gt;&gt; Exculpate, [LAUGH].\n\n85\n00:04:46.221 --> 00:04:48.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There we go.\n\n86\n00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.337\n&gt;&gt; This is a great word for law school,\nas I remember it, but it's exculpate.\n\n87\n00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:55.475\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Steve.\n\n88\n00:04:55.475 --> 00:04:58.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and just to let you know\nwhat that word means [LAUGH]\n\n89\n00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:00.025\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n90\n00:05:00.025 --> 00:05:01.088\n&gt;&gt; Because I never would\n\n91\n00:05:01.088 --> 00:05:04.900\nhave put it in this scenario,\nit means, does it excuse, in essence.\n\n92\n00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay, justify maybe?\n\n93\n00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.510\n&gt;&gt; Justify, excuse, yes.\n\n94\n00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.320\n&gt;&gt; Christopher and\nSophia's actions ethically?\n\n95\n00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.560\nWhy or why not?\n\n96\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.828\nOkay, so him being okay with\nthe situation, does it justify?\n\n97\n00:05:17.828 --> 00:05:19.456\n[LAUGH] I'll use that word instead.\n\n98\n00:05:19.456 --> 00:05:23.070\nDoes it justify their actions,\nwhat do you think, Steve?\n\n99\n00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.570\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n100\n00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.270\nAgain, we get back to that first question,\nand I talked about a policy.\n\n101\n00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.660\nAnd there should be in\nplace at a security firm,\n\n102\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.760\na written policy associated\nwith this sort of activity.\n\n103\n00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.460\nAnd going through and\nupsetting somebody is,\n\n104\n00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.140\nreally, never justified from a how\nyou treat people standpoint.\n\n105\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.060\nAnd after all, as we discussed earlier,\n\n106\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.220\nhow you treat people is a key\ncomponent to ethical behavior.\n\n107\n00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.001\nSo I would say that it does not.\n\n108\n00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:51.426\nThe fact that she apologized is\na good thing, don't get me wrong,\n\n109\n00:05:51.426 --> 00:05:53.030\nbecause we all make mistakes.\n\n110\n00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.980\nAnd she made an ethical mistake, and\nshe's attempting to properly correct it.\n\n111\n00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.260\nBut it doesn't excuse it.\n\n112\n00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and something else that\nI wanted to point out here.\n\n113\n00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.395\nDoes it say, Sophia's an intern,\nwho was the joke played on?\n\n114\n00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:08.533\nWhat was his name?\n\n115\n00:06:08.533 --> 00:06:12.296\n&gt;&gt; I can't\n&gt;&gt; Well he was an intern also, but\n\n116\n00:06:12.296 --> 00:06:15.267\nit says that Christopher\nwas the supervisor.\n\n117\n00:06:15.267 --> 00:06:20.150\nSo having that kind of\nhierarchical concept,\n\n118\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.180\nyou look at Christopher.\n\n119\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.830\nHe should be someone that\nyou're looking up to.\n\n120\n00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.970\nSo for him to be playing\nthe jokes on his subordinates,\n\n121\n00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.860\nthat's a no-no in\nthe business workplace also.\n\n122\n00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.724\nI'm not saying that if they were\nequal on that playing field,\n\n123\n00:06:34.724 --> 00:06:35.892\nit would be acceptable.\n\n124\n00:06:35.892 --> 00:06:38.172\nBut, it's even more unacceptable for\n\n125\n00:06:38.172 --> 00:06:41.500\nChristopher to be playing his\njokes on his subordinate.\n\n126\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.970\nAt least that's my take on it.\n\n127\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.780\n&gt;&gt; And\nI agree from a practical standpoint.\n\n128\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.750\nSofia, this is what,\nher first day on the job?\n\n129\n00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, her first day.\n\n130\n00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.070\nSo, he's kinda setting the tone for\nhow that business functions, and\n\n131\n00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.270\nhow they behave in the office.\n\n132\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, so if we're talking\nabout who's more in the wrong, and\n\n133\n00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.390\nwho's being more unethical.\n\n134\n00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.020\nIt's because he's the supervisor, right?\n\n135\n00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.760\n&gt;&gt; He has that responsibility,\nthat title, yeah.\n\n136\n00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.380\n&gt;&gt; And he's carrying over\nan unethical behavior for the firm.\n\n137\n00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.400\nSo, he probably should\nbe called on the carpet,\n\n138\n00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.100\nassociated with this sort of behavior,\nand yeah.\n\n139\n00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.270\nAnd told that he's wrong,\nand Sophia, I think we can,\n\n140\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.090\nto some degree, excuse her actions.\n\n141\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.390\nIt doesn't mean that her\nactions were ethical.\n\n142\n00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.670\nIt's just that,\nthey shouldn't be as, well-\n\n143\n00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.540\n&gt;&gt; Frowned upon, so much as Christopher's,\n\n144\n00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.270\nI think, in this situation.\n\n145\n00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.750\nI don't know, what did you guys think?\n\n146\n00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.350\nAt least it'll get you thinking in certain\nsituations that you really, in fact,\n\n147\n00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.130\nmay experience in real life.\n\n148\n00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.900\nSo, stay tuned, we have some\nmore scenarios headed your way.\n\n149\n00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.111\nBut for this particular episode,\nI think that about wraps it up.\n\n150\n00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:54.627\nSo, I'm your show host, Cherokee Boose,\n&gt;&gt; And I'm professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n151\n00:07:54.627 --> 00:07:57.090\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here for\nCyber Patriot.\n\n152\n00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:04.034\n[MUSIC]\n\n153\n00:08:04.034 --> 00:08:06.813\n&gt;&gt;

Hi, this is a really good scenario.\n\n12\n00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.940\nI really like this one because I think\nthat it places a person in a rough,\n\n13\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.080\nrough situation relative to what\nthey should or should not do.\n\n14\n00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.240\nSo let's go forward with it.\n\n15\n00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.740\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n16\n00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.912\nLet's go ahead and take a look at this\nscreen and see what we're presented with.\n\n17\n00:00:48.912 --> 00:00:53.080\nAll right, so here in scenario\nnumber four, good intentions.\n\n18\n00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.500\nAshley recently took a computer\nclass where she learnt about Wi-Fi.\n\n19\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.370\nShe learned that some WiFi\npasswords can easily be broken.\n\n20\n00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.750\nAshley, who is excited about\nwhat she has learned in class,\n\n21\n00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.260\nshares what she has learned with her aunt.\n\n22\n00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.640\nHer aunt states that the store where she\nworks has a Wi-Fi with one of those easily\n\n23\n00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.199\nbroken passwords, but doesn't disclose\nto Ashley what the password is.\n\n24\n00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.320\nAshley tells her aunt that is a problem,\nbut\n\n25\n00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.010\nher aunt tells her they have a very good\nIT, people who will keep them protected.\n\n26\n00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.930\nAshley really wants to help\nthe store where her aunt works, so\n\n27\n00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.940\nshe breaks the password to prove to her\naunt that the system really is broken.\n\n28\n00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.340\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at these questions here.\n\n29\n00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.260\nAll right?\n\n30\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.170\nPause your computer if you need time to go\nahead and read through these questions.\n\n31\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.280\nGive yourself a second.\n\n32\n00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.980\nWe'll come back and discuss them together.\n\n33\n00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.395\nHit the pause button now.\n\n34\n00:01:54.522 --> 00:01:58.363\nAll right, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at question number one,\n\n35\n00:01:58.363 --> 00:02:00.450\nhas Ashley acted ethically?\n\n36\n00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.430\nWhy or why not?\n\n37\n00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.100\nWhat do you think, Steve?\n\n38\n00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.450\nWhat has Ashley done here?\n\n39\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.690\n&gt;&gt; What she has done, is she's broken\ninto a system that she doesn't own and\n\n40\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.640\nher aunt doesn't own.\n\n41\n00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.880\nAnd so she has not acted ethically.\n\n42\n00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.120\nThe reality here is, well we'll get\ndown to question two where we can\n\n43\n00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.720\ndetail what she should have\ndone relative to the situation.\n\n44\n00:02:23.892 --> 00:02:26.405\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nlet's take a look at question number two.\n\n45\n00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:30.210\nAssume Ashley did not use\nthe password to access the wi-fi or\n\n46\n00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.820\nany other systems connected to the wi-fi.\n\n47\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.470\nShe only showed her aunt the password\nto help make the store more secure.\n\n48\n00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.690\nDoes that change your answer?\n\n49\n00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.950\nWould that particular change\nhelp the situation at all?\n\n50\n00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.804\n&gt;&gt; Again, Ashley or\nher aunt did not own the system.\n\n51\n00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:52.945\nAnd so the fact that she is using her\nskills that she learned in a cyber\n\n52\n00:02:52.945 --> 00:02:57.965\nsecurity class to break into the system,\nit's still breaking in without permission.\n\n53\n00:02:57.965 --> 00:02:58.955\n&gt;&gt; True\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n54\n00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:01.955\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; So, what she should have done is,\n\n55\n00:03:01.955 --> 00:03:05.810\nshe should have approached the store,\nif she wanted to.\n\n56\n00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.940\nAnd she's not required to,\nbecause she doesn't work there.\n\n57\n00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.380\nBut if she wanted to.\n\n58\n00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.357\nAnd again, this goes back to when\nI mentioned with the CISSP and\n\n59\n00:03:12.357 --> 00:03:14.510\nmy employer in an earlier scenario.\n\n60\n00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.160\nShe doesn't have to, but\nshe could go to the store.\n\n61\n00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.840\nShe could explain that she had\nlearned how to break into systems.\n\n62\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.510\nShe could've asked the store manager\nto give her an opportunity to do it.\n\n63\n00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.110\nAnd by the way, get that in writing?\n\n64\n00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.400\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nthat's your get out of jail card.\n\n65\n00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nAnd\n\n66\n00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.080\nthen demonstrate it to\nthe store manager or\n\n67\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.990\nsomebody at the store who had\nthe authority to allow her to break in.\n\n68\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.620\nAnd then provided that written\nauthority that she could so.\n\n69\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.740\nThat would've been the proper\nway to handle this.\n\n70\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n71\n00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.090\nactually, Ashley was directly defying\nher aunt's request to just let it be.\n\n72\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.480\nSo she even took it a step further, there.\n\n73\n00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.190\nSo I completely agree with\nyou on this one, Steve.\n\n74\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.970\nI think that about does it for\nthis particular scenario.\n\n75\n00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.730\nBut we have a couple more headed your way.\n\n76\n00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.740\nSo don't go anywhere, stay put.\n\n77\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.940\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n78\n00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthecum.\n\n79\n00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.993\n&gt;&gt; See you next time\nhere at Cyber Patriot.\n\n80\n00:04:07.993 --> 00:04:15.255\n[MUSIC]\n\n81\n00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.820\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:14.732\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, cyber patriots,\nto your online training videos.\n\n6\n00:00:14.732 --> 00:00:18.070\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.338\nIn this particular segment we'll be\nlooking at scenario number five.\n\n8\n00:00:21.338 --> 00:00:24.297\nThis one is called privileged information.\n\n9\n00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:27.700\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nanalyze this scenario.\n\n10\n00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.520\nAnd with us today we have\nProfessor Steve Linthicum.\n\n11\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.640\nThank you for joining us today Steve.\n\n12\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.940\n&gt;&gt; And it's great to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.580\nThis scenario will be I'd say more\nappropriate for you the students.\n\n14\n00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.220\nBecause it's in a school setting, and\nit relates specifically to activities\n\n15\n00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.230\nthat you are probably involved in\non a pretty regular basis, and\n\n16\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.620\nit's more realistic and\nmore defined for your purposes.\n\n17\n00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.630\nSo let's go ahead and proceed forward.\n\n18\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.480\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\nLet's go ahead and\n\n19\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.660\ntake a look at this particular scenario.\n\n20\n00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.270\nHere we have Jessica.\n\n21\n00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.970\nJessica has a group project due tomorrow.\n\n22\n00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.180\nAnd she and\nher friends have been working hard on it.\n\n23\n00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.750\nYesterday, her group gave the final copy\nto Derek so that he could print it out and\n\n24\n00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.000\nturn it in.\n\n25\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.490\nUnfortunately, Derek is out sick today and\nnot answering his phone.\n\n26\n00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.420\nThe group is at risk of getting a lower\ngrade if the project is turned in late.\n\n27\n00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.110\nJessica has seen Derek type in\nhis password multiple times and\n\n28\n00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.190\nknows that she can get into his email\naccount where the project is stored.\n\n29\n00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.030\nWhat should she do?\n\n30\n00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.310\nI don't know.\n\n31\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.050\nWe've got some questions here.\n\n32\n00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.150\nI want you to go through and\nread each potential answer.\n\n33\n00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.540\nSo go ahead and hit pause if you need\nthat extra pause and we'll come back and\n\n34\n00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.530\ndiscuss them.\n\n35\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.030\nSo hit pause now.\n\n36\n00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:47.240\nAll right.\n\n37\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.690\nHopefully you had time to\nreview this individual answers.\n\n38\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.160\nWhat are we looking at here Steve?\n\n39\n00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.900\nWhat do you think Jessica should\nhave done in this situation?\n\n40\n00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.810\nWhat is the correct answer?\n\n41\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.860\n&gt;&gt; Well, the initial correct answer is\nthat, Jessica should have when Derek was\n\n42\n00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.160\nentering in his password turned around\nlike this and not looked at his screen.\n\n43\n00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.580\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\nAnd I know that seems a little\n\n44\n00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.590\na bit of overkill, but as an IT\nadministrator, I have been silly and\n\n45\n00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.480\nyou kind of even just make it super\nobvious that you're not looking at\n\n46\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.390\ntheir screen, so they don't have to worry\nabout any kind of shoulder surfing, right?\n\n47\n00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.866\nRight, but she didn't know that\nshe was supposed to do that.\n\n48\n00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:26.516\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if we're looking at the correct\n\n49\n00:02:26.516 --> 00:02:30.200\nanswer here,\nmy hope is that you chose the answer C.\n\n50\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.810\nAnd what it's all about here\nis that you're identifying to\n\n51\n00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.760\nthe supervisor in the classroom,\nyour teacher, that you have this problem.\n\n52\n00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.580\nYou're being honest and up-front.\n\n53\n00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.040\nShe knows that Derek is not\nthere because he's not there.\n\n54\n00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.010\nAnd it sounds pretty reasonable.\n\n55\n00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.020\nIf you been working on a group project\nthat somebody would go through and\n\n56\n00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.510\nprint the final draft.\n\n57\n00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.270\nSo my recommendation is that\nthat's the way I would go.\n\n58\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.840\nAnd then the next morning, for\nclass, when Derek shows up.\n\n59\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.830\nAnd I probably wouldn't share\nthis information with Derek.\n\n60\n00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.910\nBecause the teacher might ask well\nDerek did you know that they were\n\n61\n00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.090\ntrying to get this password.\n\n62\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.620\nIt's just better that Derek seems\nsurprised that there is this issue.\n\n63\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.580\nSo the next morning, Derek shows up.\n\n64\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.570\nOpens up his account, and\nprints the password in class or\n\n65\n00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.960\ndistributes it to\nthe teacher in some fashion.\n\n66\n00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.000\nSo does that make sense?\n\n67\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.260\n&gt;&gt; It does and I think that every\nsingle one of the other options\n\n68\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.810\nthat we looked at here incorporated\ngetting into his account in some way which\n\n69\n00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.620\nwe discussed before that's\nnever a viable option.\n\n70\n00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.580\nSo the answer here hopefully was\na little more obvious to you guys.\n\n71\n00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.900\nIs the teacher always going to\ngive you that extra leeway?\n\n72\n00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.450\nI don't know, but\nat least it's worth a shot.\n\n73\n00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.831\nYou wanna make sure you're performing\nthe correct ethical behavior in this\n\n74\n00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:51.275\nparticular situation.\n\n75\n00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:54.770\nSo that's what we have for this scenario.\n\n76\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I think that's about it,\n\n77\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.700\nany final thoughts, Steve?\n\n78\n00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.220\n&gt;&gt; Just a thought here\nrelative to acting ethically.\n\n79\n00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.060\nYes, there may be an adverse consequence.\n\n80\n00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.910\nYou may get a lower grade in\nthis set of circumstances.\n\n81\n00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.310\nBut at least you're being honest, and\nethics is all about being honest.\n\n82\n00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.290\nAnd accepting the consequences.\n\n83\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.440\nWhich may be adverse,\nbut in the long haul.\n\n84\n00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.240\nIn the long haul,\nit's better to go in an ethical pathway.\n\n85\n00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.330\n&gt;&gt; And as a matter of fact,\nI think that's a perfect segue for\n\n86\n00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.540\nour following scenario.\n\n87\n00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.070\nBut we're not gonna tell\nyou what it's about.\n\n88\n00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.710\nYou'll have to stay tuned and check that\nout individually so don't go anywhere.\n\n89\n00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.160\nWe're gonna be right here.\n\n90\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.120\nSo stay tuned.\n\n91\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.584\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n92\n00:04:36.584 --> 00:04:38.960\n&gt;&gt;

Right, I wanted to express the fact\nthat this is really a tough scenario.\n\n13\n00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.137\nAnd probably the toughest,\nit's the last in the [CROSSTALK].\n\n14\n00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:41.066\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they saved the best for last.\n\n15\n00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.364\n&gt;&gt; So they saved the best for last.\n\n16\n00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:43.044\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n17\n00:00:43.044 --> 00:00:47.996\nwe'll probably talk a little bit about it,\nbut we'll probably all walk away with\n\n18\n00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:52.320\na sense that we don't really have\nthe correct answer possibly, okay.\n\n19\n00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.870\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nlet's take a look here at the slide.\n\n20\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.030\nWe have Joel, is a competitor in the\nCyberPatriot National Finals Competition.\n\n21\n00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.150\nDuring the competition you can\noverhear a member of another team\n\n22\n00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.470\ntalking from across another partition.\n\n23\n00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.830\nYou're not actively trying to\nhear his conversation, but\n\n24\n00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.290\nhe's a little louder than the others,\nand his voice projects rather well.\n\n25\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.500\nYou overhear him suggest checking a port\nnumber that you didn't think about.\n\n26\n00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.112\nAnd it inspires you to check that\nsame port for a vulnerability.\n\n27\n00:01:27.112 --> 00:01:32.330\nThe CyperPatriot rules, rulebook,\nstates that you should receive no outside\n\n28\n00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.250\nassistance, which includes direct and\nindirect advice.\n\n29\n00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.060\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at our questions here.\n\n30\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.900\nI'm gonna give you guys a second to\npause if you need to to read through and\n\n31\n00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.810\njust kind of think about your answers.\n\n32\n00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.010\nSo go ahead and hit that pause button now.\n\n33\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.720\nAll right, hopefully you've had enough\ntime to come to your decision here.\n\n34\n00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.020\nSo, let's take a look\nat question number one.\n\n35\n00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.710\nIs Joel obligated to report\nwhat he has overheard?\n\n36\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.449\nWhy or why not?\n\n37\n00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:05.250\nWhat do you think Steve?\n\n38\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.980\nWhat should Joel do in this situation?\n\n39\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.230\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nhe should be guided by the rule book.\n\n40\n00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.450\nAnd the rule book states that\nyou should not receive any help,\n\n41\n00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.010\neither directly or indirectly.\n\n42\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.300\nThis is probably indirect help.\n\n43\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.160\nThat would be a good definition for it.\n\n44\n00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.720\nSo he is obligated, under the rule book\nas a participant in this competition,\n\n45\n00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.730\nto report it.\n\n46\n00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.070\nIt is really that simple.\n\n47\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.280\n&gt;&gt; It's in black and white, kind of\nremoves the question out of the situation,\n\n48\n00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.280\nexactly.\n\n49\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.984\nSo let's take a look at number 2.\nWhat if Joel tells the participant to\n\n50\n00:02:36.984 --> 00:02:41.320\nquiet down and\nthat he can hear him talking?\n\n51\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.220\nDoes that exculpate Joel\nfrom what he has overheard?\n\n52\n00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.680\nNow first of all,\nlet's first take a look at that word.\n\n53\n00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.690\nWe defined it earlier as justified.\n\n54\n00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.670\nSo by Joel saying hey I can hear\nyou quiet down, does that justify\n\n55\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.190\nnot turning that information into\nthe officiants or the officials.\n\n56\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.310\nWhat do you think?\n\n57\n00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.257\n&gt;&gt; This reminds me of a situation where\nyou try to do something like unring\n\n58\n00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:06.900\na bell.\n\n59\n00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.860\nIt's a bell's run, it's in your brain-\n&gt;&gt; You heard it.\n\n60\n00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.938\n&gt;&gt; You heard that port number,\nyou heard it.\n\n61\n00:03:13.938 --> 00:03:15.170\n&gt;&gt; At that point the damage is done.\n\n62\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the damage is done.\n\n63\n00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.950\nAnd while he's not responsible for\ncausing that damage,\n\n64\n00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.400\ncertainly Joel, if there's\nculpability here, it's probably Joel.\n\n65\n00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.750\nThe fact that he reminds him to\nquiet down is a really good idea.\n\n66\n00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.800\nBut he still has that information\nin his brain, the port number, and\n\n67\n00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.870\nso he's obligated to\nreport it under the rules.\n\n68\n00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I think that's a fair\nstatement there, Steve.\n\n69\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.600\nWe see here in the context that\nit's almost self-reporting,\n\n70\n00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.480\nalthough Joel hasn't\ndone anything unethical.\n\n71\n00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.450\nWe just wanna make sure he makes\nthat correct judgement call there.\n\n72\n00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.800\nSo that about sums it up for\nour last scenario here.\n\n73\n00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.100\nBut let's go ahead and recap.\n\n74\n00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.830\nSo Steve,\nwhat do we wanna go ahead and recap?\n\n75\n00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.389\n&gt;&gt; Well basically,\nlet me bring up the summary slide.\n\n76\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.710\nThese are points that we wanted to\nmake sure that you have as a result of\n\n77\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.320\ngoing through this module.\n\n78\n00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.200\nThat you understand what ethics are and\nwhy they are important.\n\n79\n00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.650\nThat you understand how to act ethically.\n\n80\n00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.510\nYou understand the responsibility\nthat comes with knowing and\n\n81\n00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.520\nusing cybersecurity principles.\n\n82\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.530\nAnd finally, that you understand how to\napply ethics to real world scenarios.\n\n83\n00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.100\nThat's the purpose of these scenarios is-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n84\n00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.320\n&gt;&gt; To put you into a situation where\nyou have to use what you've learned\n\n85\n00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.950\nto come up with the correct answers.\n\n86\n00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.960\nAnd so\nhopefully this helped you get there.\n\n87\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.450\nAnd you're gonna be facing ethical\nissues throughout your life.\n\n88\n00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.460\nSo study hard in this area.\n\n89\n00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.380\nHelp develop your ethical behaviors\nby reading about ethics and\n\n90\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.330\nreally concentrate on this stuff, because\nyou're gonna be measured down the road as\n\n91\n00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.266\nto whether or not you perform ethically or\nnot ethically in a cybersecurity setting.\n\n92\n00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and like Steve said,\n\n93\n00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.280\nwe go though these scenarios\nto kind of prep you for that.\n\n94\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.340\nBut in real life, there's really no way\nto practice for every scenario, right.\n\n95\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.300\nAnd that's where that term\nethics comes into play.\n\n96\n00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.570\nWe just wanna set you up for\nsuccess there.\n\n97\n00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.460\nSo hopefully you were able to go ahead and\nrun through all these scenarios and\n\n98\n00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.300\nunderstand the situations, but\nthat about wraps it up for this module.\n\n99\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.240\nSo stay tuned, we do have more\ngood content coming your way.\n\n100\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.220\nFor this particular episode,\nthat's about it.\n\n101\n00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.530\nSo I\"ll just sign off as your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n102\n00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.480\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:15.501\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, cyber patriots,\nto another online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:16.480\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.260\nIn this episode, we're gonna be really\nlooking at some Security fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.050\nWe're gonna be talking\nabout our CIA Triad.\n\n8\n00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.790\nAnd we briefly touched on this topic\nbefore, but we definitely wanna solidify\n\n9\n00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.990\nthis concept because it's something\nthat you really need to know.\n\n10\n00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.140\nIt's not going away any time soon.\n\n11\n00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.840\nAnd to explain the importance of\nthese three fundamentals we have\n\n12\n00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.390\nprofessor Steve Linthicum with us today.\n\n13\n00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.920\nThank you for coming in today Steve.\n\n14\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.040\n&gt;&gt; Hi how are you doing?\n\n15\n00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.210\n&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.\n\n16\n00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.730\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we're gonna do is look at a\nwhole series of slides here that have some\n\n17\n00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.280\nfundamental concepts associated with them.\n\n18\n00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.200\nAnd you need to know these.\n\n19\n00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.220\nWhen you're going for your first interview\nfor a security job, the expectation is\n\n20\n00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.900\nthat you would get some sort of\nquestion that will relate to the triad.\n\n21\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.840\nAnd the differences between the C and\nthe I and the A and\n\n22\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.000\nthe nuances associated with each of those.\n\n23\n00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.820\nSo let me go through here and this slide\nwill help you get through this material.\n\n24\n00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.340\nSo the goal here is to understand\nconfidentiality, integrity,\n\n25\n00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.800\nand availability.\n\n26\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.200\nNow confidentiality I guess the way\nthat I would think about it,\n\n27\n00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.200\nif I wanted to simplify things,\nis that there's data out there, and\n\n28\n00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.240\nonly certain people\nneed to know that data,\n\n29\n00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.650\nneed to understand its concepts,\nits content, those sorts of things.\n\n30\n00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.470\nAnd what comes to mind to me, and you can\ncorrect me if I'm wrong on this Cherokee\n\n31\n00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.280\nfor you, is the idea of encryption.\n\n32\n00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.100\n&gt;&gt; Encryption?\n\n33\n00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.020\nYeah, definitely encryption falls\nunder one of those categories.\n\n34\n00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.760\nThat's how one of our vendors,\nactually categorizes it that way.\n\n35\n00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.900\nAnd you guys don't have to\nworry about this so much.\n\n36\n00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.340\nBut as you proceed in security, and\nwe'll look at entities such as NIST.\n\n37\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.660\nThey really do categorize quite a bit,\nmainly because well when you write\n\n38\n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.780\nyour paperwork, you have to be really\ndetailed in the types of attacks and\n\n39\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.520\nvulnerabilities that\nyou may see out there.\n\n40\n00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.560\nBut another interesting thing\nthat you mentioned Steve was\n\n41\n00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.460\nyou said kind of like\na need-to-know basis, and\n\n42\n00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.840\nthat reminded me of another security\nfundamental which I'm not sure if we'll\n\n43\n00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.770\ncover but I'll just throw it out there and\nthat's the principle of least privilege.\n\n44\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.190\nSo you can also tie that into the C for\nour C.I.A Triad.\n\n45\n00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.038\nAnd the principle of least\nprivilege basically states,\n\n46\n00:02:30.038 --> 00:02:33.990\nit's a need-to-know basis not\neveryone within an organization or\n\n47\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.250\nentity has to have\nthe same blanketed access.\n\n48\n00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.410\n&gt;&gt; We're really limiting that to\nan individual that they can go ahead and\n\n49\n00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.150\nperform their job role, their function.\n\n50\n00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.970\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n51\n00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.240\nLet me give you an example, and\n\n52\n00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.150\nsome of this comes out in the military\nwhen we talk about least privilege.\n\n53\n00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.445\nIt's more a need to know basis, that's\na good definition of least privilege.\n\n54\n00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:57.935\nYou need to know what you\nneed to know to do your job.\n\n55\n00:02:57.935 --> 00:03:01.655\nAnd to give you an idea, let's say\nthat we're talking about the army.\n\n56\n00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:04.665\nAnd there's a combat platoon.\n\n57\n00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:09.185\nAnd there's a sergeant that's\nrunning this particular effort.\n\n58\n00:03:09.185 --> 00:03:12.465\nAnd it's a secret mission.\n\n59\n00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:17.210\nAnd we have a general on that same base\nwho's in-charge of the commissary.\n\n60\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.530\nNow does that general have a need\nto know about what the sergeant and\n\n61\n00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.840\nthe platoon are doing?\n\n62\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.250\n&gt;&gt; So just to clarify that, so maybe\nnot everyone has a military background.\n\n63\n00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.360\nAs far as those ranks our general would be\nunderneath, a subordinate of our sergeant?\n\n64\n00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.210\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n65\n00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.165\n&gt;&gt; No?\nOkay, see?\n\n66\n00:03:31.165 --> 00:03:33.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The sergeant,\n\n67\n00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.550\nevery time the general\ncomes by has to salute.\n\n68\n00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay, the opposite.\n\n69\n00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.010\n&gt;&gt; That's a requirement, right.\n\n70\n00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.600\nRight.\nSo\n\n71\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.840\nthe sergeant is in-charge\nof that particular mission.\n\n72\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.820\nThe general who's in-charge\nof the commissary.\n\n73\n00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.210\nAnd that's the cafeteria.\n\n74\n00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.940\nThat's where you would eat.\n\n75\n00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:55.160\nIs not really a person in need of knowing\nwhat that particular secret mission is.\n\n76\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.900\nSo if there were reports\non the mission data,\n\n77\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.820\nthere's no reason why\nthe general would need to know.\n\n78\n00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.870\nAnd the general-\n&gt;&gt; Because it's not relative to their\n\n79\n00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.160\njob role.\n\n80\n00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd so they wouldn't get access to that\n\n81\n00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.310\nsort of thing.\n\n82\n00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.010\nSo let's go down to the next major\ncomponent of the CIA triad, and\n\n83\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.430\nthat's integrity.\n\n84\n00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.895\nAnd you can see in the slide that they\nbreak it down into two types of integrity.\n\n85\n00:04:17.895 --> 00:04:21.655\nData integrity and source integrity.\n\n86\n00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:25.240\nData integrity is probably\na little bit easier to understand.\n\n87\n00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.440\nThat is that the data, the information.\n\n88\n00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.700\nWe have a reasonable level of confidence\nthat it is what it represents to be and\n\n89\n00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.730\nit hasn't been changed\nby whoever created it.\n\n90\n00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.760\nDoes that make sense?\n\n91\n00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.662\n&gt;&gt; To me it does, but just to clarify, let\nme just summarize what I understood you\n\n92\n00:04:41.662 --> 00:04:46.270\njust said, is that I'm verifying that\nthis data has not been modified,\n\n93\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.840\ndeleted, or otherwise altered in\nany manner from its original state.\n\n94\n00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.590\n&gt;&gt; Right, that would be a great\nway to characterize it.\n\n95\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.250\nAnd then we have source integrity.\n\n96\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.850\nAnd what we, and\nthis is really a challenge sometimes.\n\n97\n00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.990\nWhen we talk about the Internet,\nhow do we know\n\n98\n00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.010\nthat the information that we're getting\nis from whoever the identified source is?\n\n99\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.710\n&gt;&gt; That's a tough one.\n\n100\n00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.510\n&gt;&gt; It is a really challenging thing.\n\n101\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.990\nAnd there are ways that we\ncan achieve this objective.\n\n102\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.920\nOne obvious way is that I meet\nyou on a street corner, and\n\n103\n00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.820\nyou hand me a letter that you wrote.\n\n104\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.050\nAnd you tell me that you wrote it.\n\n105\n00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.600\nNow is it reasonable for\nme to assume that to be correct?\n\n106\n00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.690\nI would say absolutely yes.\n\n107\n00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.193\n&gt;&gt; If they told you,\nyou're trusting my word, [CROSSTALK].\n\n108\n00:05:31.193 --> 00:05:34.350\n&gt;&gt; Well and I know you, and-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n109\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.930\nSo that's source integrity,\n\n111\n00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.750\nI'm comfortable with that\nlevel of source integrity.\n\n112\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.230\nBut what about if I get something\nfrom Cherokee over the internet,\n\n113\n00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.420\nhow do I know it's really her that\nhas sent me this information?\n\n114\n00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.620\nSo I have source integrity\nof this information.\n\n115\n00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.500\nThat becomes-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n116\n00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.900\nthe key thing that comes to my mind,\n\n117\n00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.070\nlike you said, encryption with\nconfidentiality, the number one form of\n\n118\n00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.430\nencryption that comes my mind here\nwould be hash algorithms, right?\n\n119\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, and were going to talk about\nthose its a form of encryption, so\n\n120\n00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:12.807\nencryption doesn't have to do solely\nwith confidentiality, it can help us.\n\n121\n00:06:12.807 --> 00:06:16.160\nThe algo-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah these concepts they can fall\n\n122\n00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.560\nunder 1 or more of these three legs here.\n\n123\n00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.940\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so that source integrity and\nthat really becomes\n\n124\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.480\na challenge particularly an internet\nenvironment where were not meeting face\n\n125\n00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.960\nto face on the street corner and\nI know who you are and you know who I am.\n\n126\n00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.140\n&gt;&gt; And we hear terms like\nnon-repudiation associated with that,\n\n127\n00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.340\nwhich just means, I can't deny the fact\n\n128\n00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.720\nthat I've sent you a message because\nit has my information attached to it.\n\n129\n00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nExactly.\n\n130\n00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.810\nAnd the last one here is availability.\n\n131\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.330\nAnd this is to ensure that data is\naccessible by approved users when\n\n132\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.950\nit's needed.\n\n133\n00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.340\nNow noticed that it says approved users.\n\n134\n00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n135\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.850\n&gt;&gt; Because that's important here,\n\n136\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.180\nbecause really that almost relates back\nto our discussion on confidentiality.\n\n137\n00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.520\nBecause you want to make sure that that's\nkept confidential is only accessible\n\n138\n00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.950\nto those who are intended to receive it\n&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?\n\n139\n00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.550\n&gt;&gt; It does.\nBut\n\n140\n00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.630\nwe do have to be careful with this one,\nSteve.\n\n141\n00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.550\nBecause if we put that data on\ntoo much of a lock down and\n\n142\n00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.230\nmake it inaccessible to the approved or\n\n143\n00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.950\nauthorized users, that's when we can run\nacross some problems as well, right?\n\n144\n00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.420\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n145\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.970\n&gt;&gt; So,\n&gt;&gt; that's our CIA triad, and if we-\n\n146\n00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.720\n&gt;&gt; Right, we're gonna go on to the next\n\n147\n00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.020\nlittle bit of information that's being\nprovided here that's part of, or\n\n148\n00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.540\nassociated with the triad.\n\n149\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.050\nIt's protecting the triad,\nand it's really more about,\n\n150\n00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.790\nas they say you're on\nthe slide technology.\n\n151\n00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.359\nAnd what we're talking about here\nare people, processes, and technology.\n\n152\n00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:52.813\nAnd one of the things that isn't\nmention in this slide, but\n\n153\n00:07:52.813 --> 00:07:57.040\nit's clearly obvious is,\nas we start make things more secure.\n\n154\n00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.328\nMaybe they get less usable.\n\n155\n00:07:59.328 --> 00:08:02.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I could see that happening,\nand people try to take shortcuts.\n\n156\n00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.240\nAnd that's another reason we\ncould come into some issues.\n\n157\n00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, so here,\nwhat we're talking about is people,\n\n158\n00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.420\nprocesses, and technology.\n\n159\n00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.120\nFor people, we need to train\nthem how to use resources and\n\n160\n00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.640\nstay away from threats and\n\n161\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.810\nvulnerabilities that could jeopardize the\nsecurity of that which they're accessing.\n\n162\n00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.800\n&gt;&gt; Well, sure,\nyou see that last term for technology.\n\n163\n00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.960\nI can go ahead and implement all sorts\nof technical security controls and\n\n164\n00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.300\nmeasures in my mind to prevent the\nattackers from coming into my environment.\n\n165\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:44.700\nBut if I have one end user, my people\nthere, that isn't trained properly, they\n\n166\n00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.130\ndon't even know that my security controls\nexist, then that's really my weak link.\n\n167\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.300\n&gt;&gt; And this third area processes.\n\n168\n00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.490\nThis is something that I always\nencourage students to know how to write,\n\n169\n00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:00.850\nbecause what you're gonna be doing in\ncybersecurity is you're going to be having\n\n170\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:07.930\nto deal with policies, procedures, rules\nassociated with maintenance of security.\n\n171\n00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.770\nAnd you're gonna be oftentimes\ninvolved in the process of\n\n172\n00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.338\npreparing these policies and\nrules and procedures.\n\n173\n00:09:15.338 --> 00:09:17.180\nBecause you're gonna become\na security expert, and\n\n174\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.810\nyou're gonna know what needs to happen.\n\n175\n00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.540\nAnd fortunately for\nus in the security business,\n\n176\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.110\nthere are a whole bunch of standards\norganizations that help assist us,\n\n177\n00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.510\nrelative to these sort of policies, and\nrules, and procedures, and standards.\n\n178\n00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.140\nIt's really important that we follow\nthose, that we have some uniformity\n\n179\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.205\nacross systems and\nacross companies In across networks.\n\n180\n00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:46.180\nBecause you may not always work at that\nsame company where your first job is.\n\n181\n00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.535\nChances are you won't,\nto be quite honest with you.\n\n182\n00:09:48.535 --> 00:09:52.075\nAnd so when you step in to\na new secured environment,\n\n183\n00:09:52.075 --> 00:09:57.015\nyou need to have an understanding of\nwhat's important, and the processes.\n\n184\n00:09:57.015 --> 00:10:00.235\nAnd it's much easier if the company\nthat you used to work for, and\n\n185\n00:10:00.235 --> 00:10:04.800\nthe company that you go to for\nyour new job seem to follow the same\n\n186\n00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.670\nset of standards and policies, and\nprocedure relative to security.\n\n187\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.366\nThat way,\nyou don't have to relearn things.\n\n188\n00:10:12.366 --> 00:10:17.360\nThe challenge is that we wish that all\ncompanies and agencies and government, and\n\n189\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.620\nschools, and\n\n190\n00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:24.600\nall these entities practiced these\nstandardized processes and procedures.\n\n191\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.160\n&gt;&gt; But they don't, and you brought\nup a really good point there, Steve,\n\n192\n00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.080\nsaying that, look, you guys can go online\nand look for different entities like Sand.\n\n193\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.420\nThere are a lot of templates out there for\ndifferent types of policies.\n\n194\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.730\nBut that's exactly what they are,\ntemplates, or boilerplates,\n\n195\n00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.510\njust basic canned,\njust to give you an idea.\n\n196\n00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.828\nBecause every policy and every company\nyou work for, like Steve was saying,\n\n197\n00:10:45.828 --> 00:10:47.830\nis going to be slightly different.\n\n198\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.210\nYou can't just copy and\npaste from some other organization.\n\n199\n00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.020\nSo, the chances of you having to create,\nor\n\n200\n00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.410\nat least contribute to some sort of policy\nwriting, fairly, fairly accurate there.\n\n201\n00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.046\nYou might come across that pretty often.\n\n202\n00:11:02.046 --> 00:11:07.503\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and it's amazing, when you get\ninto, for example, I'm in education,\n\n203\n00:11:07.503 --> 00:11:12.470\nand I can tell you this because I'm\na faculty member, we faculty members\n\n204\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.330\nkind of view the network as our-\n&gt;&gt; Your babies?\n\n205\n00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, our baby.\n\n206\n00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.430\nOur baby.\n\n207\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.600\nThe IT department doesn't\nview it that way, and so\n\n208\n00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.710\nthere are battles oftentimes over\nwhat sort of security we implement.\n\n209\n00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:30.880\nBecause security can be challenging to\novercome in a classroom, for example.\n\n210\n00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.820\nAnd let me give you an idea of that\nthat we experienced at our college.\n\n211\n00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.322\nA real simple security issue is,\nwhen does your screen lock?\n\n212\n00:11:39.322 --> 00:11:42.630\nWithout use,\nyou don't touch the keyboard, and\n\n213\n00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:47.580\nprobably at ITPro,\nI would imagine maybe it's ten minutes?\n\n214\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.520\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna know.\n\n215\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.762\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna know, okay.\n\n216\n00:11:50.762 --> 00:11:52.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n217\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.470\n&gt;&gt; In college, that doesn't work, or\n\n218\n00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.210\nin high school or in middle school,\n\n219\n00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.730\nbecause I'm in front of my computer\ngiving you a presentation.\n\n220\n00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.730\n&gt;&gt; Lecture, or something, yeah.\n\n221\n00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.682\n&gt;&gt; And\nI'm walking around the classroom, and\n\n222\n00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:08.785\nif I have to run back to my computer\nevery five minutes to touch the touchpad,\n\n223\n00:12:08.785 --> 00:12:14.075\nor hit the Escape key or something,\nthat would really interrupt my progress.\n\n224\n00:12:14.075 --> 00:12:15.115\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, once you're on a roll, yeah.\n\n225\n00:12:15.115 --> 00:12:16.435\n&gt;&gt; And you're learning.\n\n226\n00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:18.570\n&gt;&gt; Don't stop that power tree.\n\n227\n00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.690\n&gt;&gt; So, in a lot of entities and\na lot of high security entities,\n\n228\n00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.420\nten minutes would probably be five,\nten minutes would probably a norm.\n\n229\n00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.840\nAnd the whole idea here is that you get\nup, and you leave your computer in.\n\n230\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.920\nIf we don't have this automatic locking\nmechanism after a period of inactivity,\n\n231\n00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.425\nthen we have a problem.\n\n232\n00:12:34.425 --> 00:12:35.347\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n233\n00:12:35.347 --> 00:12:43.370\n&gt;&gt; So maybe you'll have to recommend\ncorrecting [LAUGH] this issue at ITProTV.\n\n234\n00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.912\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, but every environment\nis gonna be different, and yeah,\n\n235\n00:12:46.912 --> 00:12:50.334\nyou might even have some,\nespecially if we talk about government,\n\n236\n00:12:50.334 --> 00:12:54.360\nI'm sure they have pretty strict\nregulations to follow there as well.\n\n237\n00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's go onto this next slide,\n\n238\n00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.320\nwhich is the CIA Triad,\nTech Tools of the Trade.\n\n239\n00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.190\nAnd here with confidentiality,\nthey actually do us a great favor\n\n240\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.850\nhere in breaking this things out with-\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n241\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.750\n&gt;&gt; Confidentiality, we have encryption.\n\n242\n00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.840\nAnd here we're talking\nabout basically scrambling.\n\n243\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.150\nScrambling the contents,\nso it's unreadable.\n\n244\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.195\n&gt;&gt; Obfuscation?\n\n245\n00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:18.014\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a good word, but\n\n246\n00:13:18.014 --> 00:13:21.330\nI'm not sure it's a middle school word.\n\n247\n00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:21.860\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n248\n00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.680\nwe'll try and stay away from that one.\n\n249\n00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.630\nWe're scrambling them up,\nso you can't read it.\n\n250\n00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.840\nIt becomes ciphertext,\nas opposed to plain text.\n\n251\n00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.680\nAnd what we wanna do is we wanna\nmake sure that you can't read that,\n\n252\n00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.110\nunless you have some\nsort of a key to read it.\n\n253\n00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.150\nA password might be a good example.\n\n254\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.112\nSo with that password,\nyou could put that in.\n\n255\n00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:47.650\nFor example, Microsoft Word,\nthere's a way that you can\n\n256\n00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:53.320\npassword protect a file, and basically,\nwhat's happening is it's encrypted,\n\n257\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.300\nand then you have to insert that password\nto decrypt it, so it's readable.\n\n258\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.159\n&gt;&gt; And you see this term here,\nencryption keys, but\n\n259\n00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:00.893\nthat's essentially the same thing, right?\n\n260\n00:14:00.893 --> 00:14:01.928\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Steve, so\n\n261\n00:14:01.928 --> 00:14:06.270\nwe're treating our password as a key\nthat essentially unlocks that document.\n\n262\n00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.330\nso we have to not lose our key, right?\n\n263\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.850\nRemember the password-\n&gt;&gt; That's right, or\n\n264\n00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.620\nyou'll never get back in it.\n\n265\n00:14:12.684 --> 00:14:16.830\nAnd also, under confidentiality, we have\nuser access control, and this is that need\n\n266\n00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.990\nto know, this is that you as a user\ncan access that document, for example.\n\n267\n00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:27.630\nSo, it's controlling which users\nhave access to a resource, so\n\n268\n00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:32.360\nin this case, they mentioned to networks,\nand at what level of access you have.\n\n269\n00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.410\nAnd when we talk about level of access,\nlet me just make it simple,\n\n270\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:37.720\nlet's talk about a document.\n\n271\n00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.305\nWell, your level of access mean, may\nmean that you have the right to read it,\n\n272\n00:14:41.305 --> 00:14:43.304\nbut you don't have the right to modify it.\n\n273\n00:14:43.304 --> 00:14:44.418\n&gt;&gt; And change that document.\n\n274\n00:14:44.418 --> 00:14:48.377\n&gt;&gt; Right, it defines what you can do.\n\n275\n00:14:48.377 --> 00:14:50.230\n&gt;&gt; And those are called permissions.\n\n276\n00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.149\nSo, we can go ahead and\nset certain permissions based on whomever,\n\n277\n00:14:54.149 --> 00:14:58.711\nthe creator of that document, there\nare different models that we can look at.\n\n278\n00:14:58.711 --> 00:15:03.012\nBut basically, if I create a document, and\nI was worried that Steve would modify it,\n\n279\n00:15:03.012 --> 00:15:06.747\nI'd say no, Steve can't modify, but\nSteve does have read permission.\n\n280\n00:15:06.747 --> 00:15:08.126\nSo he can view that document, and\n\n281\n00:15:08.126 --> 00:15:10.970\nthat's what he's talking about\nthere with access control.\n\n282\n00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.190\nYou're essentially\ncontrolling who has access.\n\n283\n00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.002\n&gt;&gt; And what they can do.\n\n284\n00:15:15.002 --> 00:15:17.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, and then down here,\n\n285\n00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:18.960\nan integrity.\n\n286\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.620\nAgain, we have the word encryption.\n\n287\n00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:27.090\nAnd the reason we have that,\nthat earlier, Cherokee mentioned hashing.\n\n288\n00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.360\nAnd what happens is that we\ncan go through, and actually,\n\n289\n00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.610\nand I like to use documents as an example,\n\n290\n00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:40.340\nwe can create a word document where it has\nalmost standard phrase, the sky is blue.\n\n291\n00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:46.020\nAnd we can run it through a hashing\nalgorithm, that particular file.\n\n292\n00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.405\nAnd it will come out\nwith a real long number,\n\n293\n00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:50.996\nthat's a combination of letters and\nnumbers.\n\n294\n00:15:50.996 --> 00:15:53.671\nAnd if I go through and\nI open that file and\n\n295\n00:15:53.671 --> 00:15:57.527\nI put a period after the hash is blue and\nsave the document,\n\n296\n00:15:57.527 --> 00:16:02.117\nwe'll get a completely different number,\ncompletely different.\n\n297\n00:16:02.117 --> 00:16:06.346\nAnd the key here is that\nit's a different number so\n\n298\n00:16:06.346 --> 00:16:10.475\nwe can tell that document\nhas been modified, and\n\n299\n00:16:10.475 --> 00:16:15.120\nit's kind of a weird sort\nof concept to understand.\n\n300\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.100\nBut also the good news is we can't tell\nfrom that number what the file said,\n\n301\n00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.710\nwhat the language was in the file.\n\n302\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:28.280\nBut if I create that message and\nI send it to Cherokee,\n\n303\n00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.440\nand I also get to her the hash,\nthen she can open that Word document,\n\n304\n00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.800\nand she has some assurance that it\nhasn't been modified or changed.\n\n305\n00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so Steve what you're saying is,\nyou go ahead and write me a message.\n\n306\n00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.982\nYou apply a math algorithm\nonto that message.\n\n307\n00:16:46.982 --> 00:16:51.360\nWhat generates my hash value,\nokay which is a big,\n\n308\n00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.430\nthe big law of number that you mentioned.\n\n309\n00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.090\nAnd then when I received that message,\nI go ahead and\n\n310\n00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.790\ntake that same algorithm that\nyou applied to your message.\n\n311\n00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.900\nOnce I decrypted my message I\napply that same algorithm and\n\n312\n00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.900\nI should get this same exact long number,\nso that we know that that message\n\n313\n00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:13.030\nhasn't been modified or intercepted,\nchanged between you to me, right?\n\n314\n00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:18.860\n&gt;&gt; Well, and you didn't even need to\nencrypt the number, I mean the message.\n\n315\n00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.545\nBecause all we're really\ntalking about is integrity.\n\n316\n00:17:21.545 --> 00:17:24.040\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Not confidentiality.\n\n317\n00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, I'm definitely,\n\n318\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.852\nyou can call me paranoid because\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:17:27.852 --> 00:17:29.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Data in transit,\n\n320\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.410\nwhenever I'm sending you\na message I'm always concerned\n\n321\n00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.640\nabout someone intercepting there but\nit really it isn't a need.\n\n322\n00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.480\nAnd that brings up another good point,\nis encryption, right, we go ahead and\n\n323\n00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.520\nwe take and we apply a cypher to that\nplain text to generate ciphertext.\n\n324\n00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.882\nNormally when we're transmitting data,\nbecause we normally use the Internet.\n\n325\n00:17:47.882 --> 00:17:50.950\nThe Internet's a public network and\nwe don't know everyone on the Internet so\n\n326\n00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.810\nwe're kind of concerned about that.\n\n327\n00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.300\nAnd then whenever I receive that message,\nI decrypt, okay.\n\n328\n00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.210\nAnd I remove the cipher so\nthat I have plain text.\n\n329\n00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:02.130\nBut when we talk about hashing algorithms,\nyeah,\n\n330\n00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.940\nwe don't ever have to decrypt because\nit's considered a one way hash function.\n\n331\n00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.950\nYou don't ever need to go backwards.\n\n332\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthis can get a little bit confusing but\n\n333\n00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:17.020\nagain we're using encryption and\nthe integrity model to\n\n334\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.590\nassure us that whatever we have hasn't\nbeen changed from wherever it was.\n\n335\n00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:22.160\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n336\n00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.220\n&gt;&gt; I think it's kind of the way to do it.\n\n337\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:28.970\nAnd then also in integrity again\nwe come back to file permissions.\n\n338\n00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:34.130\nThis is where you can limit what\n\n339\n00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:40.500\ncan be done associated with a file, what\npermissions a user has with regard to it.\n\n340\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.130\nAnd we also have down here version\ncontrol systems and backups.\n\n341\n00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.020\nI'm trying to figure out how we would\nrelate that here, really, with integrity.\n\n342\n00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay, version control.\n\n343\n00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.400\nI think that if someone,\nlet's say we have a shared document.\n\n344\n00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.440\nAnd I'm making changes and Steve's making\nchanges, and you're making changes.\n\n345\n00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.820\nWe wanna make sure we can tell\nwho's made those changes.\n\n346\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:09.600\nSo if we look at that metadata, and\nwe might even say, okay, this version,\n\n347\n00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.740\nwe even have a numbering scheme.\n\n348\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:15.620\nVersion 1.0, 1.1, Version 2.0,\nthat's where you kind of hear that.\n\n349\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.940\nAs long as we're all on the same page and\nwe're aware that those changes have\n\n350\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.730\nbeen made, then I think that would be\nthe best way to go ahead and look at that.\n\n351\n00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n352\n00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:29.150\nLet's drop down to availability,\ncuz there's some key concepts here.\n\n353\n00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.370\nAnd availability,\nas we've talked about in the past,\n\n354\n00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.990\nis that document available for your use?\n\n355\n00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:39.734\nAnd we want assurances that it is\navailable, we want assurances and\n\n356\n00:19:39.734 --> 00:19:41.910\nso we have to deal with a couple issues.\n\n357\n00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:46.999\nFirst of all, as I mentioned here,\noffsite data storage/backup.\n\n358\n00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:53.730\nSo often, this is unfortunately ignored,\nand the challenge with\n\n359\n00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:58.490\nthis is that we're dealing with computers\nthat have storage capabilities.\n\n360\n00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.970\nAnd particularly in\na spinning disk environment.\n\n361\n00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.010\nHard drives fail,\nthey will eventually fail.\n\n362\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.380\n&gt;&gt; Mechanical moving parts,\nthere's not a question to it.\n\n363\n00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.260\nIt will fail, it's just a matter of when.\n\n364\n00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.560\n&gt;&gt; And so what you wanna be sure of,\nabsolutely sure of,\n\n365\n00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.790\nis that you have a backup.\n\n366\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:23.450\nAnd I follow some recommendations of some\nreally smart people out there at my home,\n\n367\n00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.660\nthis computer, when it's at home.\n\n368\n00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.680\nI am backing up to a local source.\n\n369\n00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.320\nBut I also use a commercial product.\n\n370\n00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.600\nAnd I could show you what it is.\n\n371\n00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.750\nBut it's well known out there,\nand it's a great product.\n\n372\n00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:47.930\nIt takes away from me the responsibility\nof backing up to an online source.\n\n373\n00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.560\nCarbon, what is it?\n\n374\n00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.000\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\nare you talking about the cloud option?\n\n375\n00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We do have a lot-\n\n376\n00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n377\n00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:54.130\n&gt;&gt; Of extra option\n\n378\n00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.790\nout there now with the advent wall,\nit's so popular with cloud computing.\n\n379\n00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.100\nI can have a plan A and I can have a plan\nB, so I can have an external hard disk\n\n380\n00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:08.090\ndrive or a large flash drive or some other\nnetwork share locally or guess what?\n\n381\n00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.180\nI could go ahead and\ngo across the Internet and\n\n382\n00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:15.610\nstore my information on a third party's\npiece of equipment in the cloud.\n\n383\n00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.590\nSo we have a couple\ndifferent options there.\n\n384\n00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.135\n&gt;&gt; I now remember the name.\n\n385\n00:21:19.135 --> 00:21:20.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay so what's it called?\n\n386\n00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:21.500\n&gt;&gt; It's Carbonite.\n\n387\n00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.510\n&gt;&gt; Carbonite, okay\n&gt;&gt; And the reason I use Carbonite is\n\n388\n00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.450\nITPro advertises a great\ndeal on the Twit network.\n\n389\n00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.584\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And Leo Laporte, and\n\n390\n00:21:31.584 --> 00:21:35.470\nif you haven't got a chance\ngo out to twit.tv.\n\n391\n00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:40.855\nBecause there's a great deal of this\nsort of talking going on on podcasts.\n\n392\n00:21:40.855 --> 00:21:47.190\nAnd of their podcasters, one of\ntheir chief experts is Steve Gibson.\n\n393\n00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:52.860\nAnd oftentimes, I hear from him and\nfrom Leo Laporte who is Mister TWIT.\n\n394\n00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.224\n&gt;&gt; This Week in Technology.\n\n395\n00:21:54.224 --> 00:21:55.166\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n396\n00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:55.832\n&gt;&gt; It's an acronym.\n\n397\n00:21:55.832 --> 00:22:01.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That it is so very important to backup\n\n398\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:06.162\nlocally and backup to an offsite location.\n\n399\n00:22:06.162 --> 00:22:08.918\nThe problem is that,\nwhat happens if your house burns down and\n\n400\n00:22:08.918 --> 00:22:12.090\nyour external hard drive,\n&gt;&gt; Precious documents get damaged\n\n401\n00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:12.680\nas well, Yeah.\n\n402\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, your external hard drive is\nsitting right next to your computer and\n\n403\n00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.640\nyour computer burns up and guess what\nhappens to that external hard drive\n\n404\n00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.370\nwhich is your backup, your only backup,\nit also burns up in the fire.\n\n405\n00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.110\n&gt;&gt; So\nit's very important that you back up.\n\n406\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.180\nAnd also they mention here, and\n\n407\n00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.140\nwe've talked about this in the past,\nredundant architecture.\n\n408\n00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.000\nMeaning that you can have\na single point of failure.\n\n409\n00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.500\nFor example, a company like ITPro,\n\n410\n00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.410\nthey may have multiple\naccesses to the Internet.\n\n411\n00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:42.460\nThey may be using-\n&gt;&gt; We do,\n\n412\n00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.930\nwe have two Internet service providers.\n\n413\n00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.470\n&gt;&gt; Two Internet service providers.\n\n414\n00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:48.750\nMakes perfect sense,\nmy college has the same thing.\n\n415\n00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:52.340\nBecause if one goes down,\nI don't know what you would do working.\n\n416\n00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.280\nFirst of all, you'd have a challenge\nbecause you can't get out to the Internet.\n\n417\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.000\n&gt;&gt; Sure, that's what we do.\n\n418\n00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.990\n&gt;&gt; And your customers can't come in\nhere to download or view your content.\n\n419\n00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:05.220\nSo it's very important that\nyou have that sort of content.\n\n420\n00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.460\n&gt;&gt; Have a high availability there.\n\n421\n00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.680\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n422\n00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.045\nSo that I think pretty much covers\neverything for this module,well,\n\n423\n00:23:11.045 --> 00:23:14.190\nwent longer than I think we thought\nit was gonna but that's good.\n\n424\n00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.750\n&gt;&gt; It's all right, we have a lot of stuff\nto cover, a lot of good information.\n\n425\n00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.900\nSo stay tuned, don't go anywhere,\nwe have more headed your way.\n\n426\n00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.770\nI think that does about wrap it up for\nthis episode.\n\n427\n00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.780\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n428\n00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.320\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yes, yes, okay.\n\n31\n00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:47.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; From a technical standpoint, Steve,\n\n32\n00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.410\nwould things like unpatched systems\nbe considered a vulnerability or\n\n33\n00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.430\nnot using a password?\n\n34\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.920\nThose are things that are vulnerabilities,\nthat's leaving a weakness so\n\n35\n00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.770\nto speak, right?\n\n36\n00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a very good analogy for\nthis subject matter.\n\n37\n00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.980\nI was trying to go outside of the subject\nmatter to explain it in a way that\n\n38\n00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.000\nsomebody who isn't used to security terms-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go for it.\n\n39\n00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.660\n&gt;&gt; Could understand.\n\n40\n00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.570\nSo exploits, the method by which\nthe attacker can use a vulnerability.\n\n41\n00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.650\nWell, an exploit in automobiles would be,\nI guess,\n\n42\n00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.500\nhitting you and\nthat would be exercising a vulnerability.\n\n43\n00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.975\nYou're driving down the road,\nthey're driving down the road,\n\n44\n00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:31.823\nthey're not a very good driver and\nthey hit you.\n\n45\n00:02:31.823 --> 00:02:34.884\nAnd on the next term,\ndown here is risk and\n\n46\n00:02:34.884 --> 00:02:38.127\neverytime we go out on\na road we're at risk.\n\n47\n00:02:38.127 --> 00:02:39.890\n&gt;&gt; We're taking slight risk, yeah.\n\n48\n00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.570\nWe know the risks associated\nwith getting into that vehicle,\n\n49\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.270\nwe could potentially get an accident,\nsame thing with the Internet.\n\n50\n00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.050\nWe know that there are risks out there and\nwe still choose to go ahead, and\n\n51\n00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.510\nthat's where we see things like risk\nassessment companies will go into that and\n\n52\n00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.270\nmake decisions.\n\n53\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.970\n&gt;&gt; Those of you who are of driving age or\n\n54\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.330\napproaching driving age,\nyou can't get rid of risks entirely.\n\n55\n00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.792\nOkay, you can't ignore them,\nthey exist and we have to deal with them.\n\n56\n00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:11.543\nTo give you an example of how we deal with\nthem, as I am required by the state of\n\n57\n00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:16.618\nCalifornia, I assumed the same thing is\ntrue in other state across the country.\n\n58\n00:03:16.618 --> 00:03:20.330\nI would hope it would be,\nI'm required to carry insurance.\n\n59\n00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.330\nThe idea with insurance is that I'm\ntransferring some of that risks To\n\n60\n00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.860\nan insurance company so if there is\nan issue, if somebody is hurt for example.\n\n61\n00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.300\nThere is an ability for them to\nrecover from me through my insurance.\n\n62\n00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.580\nNow I also assume some of that\nrisk is why we pay a deductible.\n\n63\n00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.980\nThis is a,\nif I get involved in an accident and\n\n64\n00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.090\nI have a $500 deductible Guess what?\n\n65\n00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.990\nI get to pay $500 of the damages.\n\n66\n00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.610\nSo those are just some\nterms that's associated\n\n67\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.840\noutside of the cybersecurity world.\n\n68\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.030\nBut they exist in the cybersecurity\nworld because today\n\n69\n00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.370\nwe have cybersecurity insurance.\n\n70\n00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.440\nSo there is this idea of transferring\nif my company system's gets hacked and\n\n71\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.100\nthere's damages People.\n\n72\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.860\nWell, there's some damage somewhere,\nsome resulting damage.\n\n73\n00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.720\nThey can recover from my company but\n\n74\n00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.300\nthey can also partially\nrecover from my insurance.\n\n75\n00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.430\nAnd then I have to pick up my deductible.\n\n76\n00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.240\nThat sort of thing from\na business standpoint.\n\n77\n00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.010\n&gt;&gt; I see.\nHere at my company,\n\n78\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.980\nwe have lots of different options for\ndifferent insurance.\n\n79\n00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.400\nI have.\n\n80\n00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.170\nHate to say it but death and\ndismemberment, disability,\n\n81\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.476\nyou talked about automobile insurance,\nglasses, dental, health,\n\n82\n00:04:35.476 --> 00:04:38.550\nthe list goes on,\nwhat if I can't afford all of that Steve,\n\n83\n00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.960\nis there any kind of tools or a place\nwhere I could just help me make this\n\n84\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.560\ndecision to choose the most\nbeneficial type of\n\n85\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.430\ninsurance to buy That's a good question\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n86\n00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.020\n&gt;&gt; I see your notes here, and\n\n87\n00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.700\nI see a very important tool that\nI think can help me with that.\n\n88\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.750\n&gt;&gt; Here we are now to risks and\nprobability and impact, okay.\n\n89\n00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.450\nAnd that's where you were leading to.\n\n90\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I was a little\n\n91\n00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.090\nslow in catching it, okay.\n\n92\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.670\nSo you've got to be\nconcerned about certain\n\n93\n00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.250\naspects associated with risk analysis.\n\n94\n00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.150\nThat's really what we're\ntalking about here.\n\n95\n00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.600\nSo what's the probability\nof this happening.\n\n96\n00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.560\nAnd they gave us a couple examples here.\n\n97\n00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.350\nProbability, how much motivation Does an\nattacker have to try to exploit my system?\n\n98\n00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.950\nHow hard do they have to work to do it?\n\n99\n00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.250\nAre we really subjecting\nour systems to attack?\n\n100\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.392\nNow when I go out and\n\n101\n00:05:37.392 --> 00:05:42.690\nI drive, I try to drive safely,\nso I'm trying to mitigate\n\n102\n00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.690\nthe consequences So-\n&gt;&gt; If I wanted to hit you,\n\n103\n00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.950\nSteve, I don't think it would be too\nhard for me to crash into your vehicle.\n\n104\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I would literally steer my steering\n\n105\n00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.430\nwheel, same thing online.\n\n106\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.900\n&gt;&gt; But we don't expect you to do that.\n\n107\n00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.825\n&gt;&gt; No. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So\nthe probability just isn't there.\n\n108\n00:05:58.825 --> 00:05:59.727\n[CROSSTALK] Is reduced.\n\n109\n00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:01.005\n&gt;&gt; I hope not.\n\n110\n00:06:01.005 --> 00:06:01.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so, we look and\n\n111\n00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.700\nwe're talking about systems again.\n\n112\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.840\nHow securely have I protected my system.\n\n113\n00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.510\nNow there been a lot of studies out there\nand if you go within unprotected system\n\n114\n00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.600\nand plug it in to the internet\nwhere has a public IP address.\n\n115\n00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.550\nIt's accessible by anybody\nthrough the internet.\n\n116\n00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.380\nThat's system has probably\ngonna sit there for\n\n117\n00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.890\na very very short period of\ntime before it's attacked.\n\n118\n00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:24.740\nThreat.\n&gt;&gt; Very.\n\n119\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.420\nSo the assumption is that that unprotected\nsystem is going to be attacked.\n\n120\n00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.470\nIt's probably a safe assumption and\nattacked rather quickly.\n\n121\n00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.870\nSo the next thing that we have to look at\nis, okay, we've got this system out there\n\n122\n00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.590\nthat's unprotected,\nhow much potential damage could it do?\n\n123\n00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.360\nRelative to that particular system.\n\n124\n00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.110\nWell, it depends on what that system\nhas on it in terms of data, probably,\n\n125\n00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.440\nmore than anything else, right?\n\n126\n00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.160\n&gt;&gt; How special that is to me,\nif it's sensitive information.\n\n127\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.540\nOr, if I just use it as\nan online browsing machine.\n\n128\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.980\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\ngive you a great example of impacts\n\n129\n00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.400\n&gt;&gt; Think about medical records and how\n\n130\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.270\nthey can be, well the impact associated\nwith the fact that they are attacked.\n\n131\n00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.130\nIt could be\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n132\n00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.600\n&gt;&gt; You know a real issue.\n\n133\n00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.640\n&gt;&gt; I don't want people knowing my\nhealth problems, my health concerns,\n\n134\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.660\nmy date of birth, where I live,\nall that information, right?\n\n135\n00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n136\n00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.240\nSo this risk matrix that\nthey have to the right here.\n\n137\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.820\nThis is kind of a useful tool\nin determining what sort of\n\n138\n00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.730\nconclusion you have to\ndraw I guess I would say.\n\n139\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.935\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can identify\n&gt;&gt; Find the areas that really need\n\n140\n00:07:34.935 --> 00:07:39.145\nme the most attention because I\nmight not have an unlimited budget.\n\n141\n00:07:39.145 --> 00:07:42.425\nI mean I'd like to but that's not always\nthe case and I might have to pick and\n\n142\n00:07:42.425 --> 00:07:45.535\nchoose where I'm implementing controls.\n\n143\n00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:50.420\nSo I can say I'm gonna get the biggest\nbang from my buck by protecting\n\n144\n00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.260\nThis asset, right?\n\n145\n00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if, give you an example here.\n\n146\n00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.570\nIn the upper left-hand corner something\nwhere there's a rare probability of\n\n147\n00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:59.850\nit happening.\n\n148\n00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.110\nAnd even if it happened, the impact-\n&gt;&gt; Is pretty trivial.\n\n149\n00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.800\nIt says all the way in this low category.\n\n150\n00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you're not gonna spend much\nresources in that area protecting that\n\n151\n00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.410\nparticular block.\n\n152\n00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.800\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; It wouldn't make sense to do that.\n\n153\n00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.694\nBut it's very likely to occur and\nthe damage could be extreme.\n\n154\n00:08:16.694 --> 00:08:17.878\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Down at the bottom\n\n155\n00:08:17.878 --> 00:08:19.400\nright-hand corner there, Steve?\n\n156\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nthat's where you're gonna focus.\n\n157\n00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:26.100\nThat's exactly where you're gonna\nfocus because we don't have typically\n\n158\n00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.895\nin business or government,\nan unlimited supply of money.\n\n159\n00:08:28.895 --> 00:08:32.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so, we gotta knock off the real\n\n160\n00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.820\n&gt;&gt; Problems.\n\n161\n00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.410\nThe real potential issues.\n\n162\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.700\nAnd that's what this whole risk\nmanagement sort of function is.\n\n163\n00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.560\nSo continuing on here.\n\n164\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.000\nThey give us an example and\nthis is the target example.\n\n165\n00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.402\n&gt;&gt; And I think I talk about\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n166\n00:08:48.402 --> 00:08:49.260\n&gt;&gt; Earlier.\n\n167\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.540\nSo the case was attackers breach targets.\n\n168\n00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.760\nAnd we're talking about that\nthing that looks like a bullseye.\n\n169\n00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.610\n&gt;&gt; The retail store.\n\n170\n00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.950\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n171\n00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a fitting image.\n\n172\n00:08:58.445 --> 00:08:58.945\n&gt;Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n173\n00:08:58.945 --> 00:09:01.530\n&gt;&gt; I didn't even think about that no\n\n174\n00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.768\npun intended, right?\n\n175\n00:09:02.768 --> 00:09:03.378\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n176\n00:09:03.378 --> 00:09:07.635\n[LAUGH] So, attackers breach target's\nnetwork through the heating and\n\n177\n00:09:07.635 --> 00:09:10.310\nair-conditioning, that's\nthe H pack we call that.\n\n178\n00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:16.230\nCompanies and point of sale systems to\nsteal 40 million credit card numbers.\n\n179\n00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.820\nThey actually-\n&gt;&gt; A point of sale system Steve,\n\n180\n00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.830\nthat's just like where the cashiers are,\nwhen you're checking out.\n\n181\n00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.590\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly and the issue here,\nand they don't really\n\n182\n00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.040\nmention it was unfortunately\nthey were on the same network.\n\n183\n00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.810\nMeaning that the control systems for\nthe air-conditioning run the same network,\n\n184\n00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.660\non the same wire.\n\n185\n00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.560\n&gt;&gt; I guess is the best way to look\nat it as the point of sale machines.\n\n186\n00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.106\nSo whoever was able to break in and\naccess through the entry point for\n\n187\n00:09:41.106 --> 00:09:46.050\nthe HVAC system was able to reach out and\ntouch the point of sale systems and\n\n188\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.093\nwas able [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well sure, that's where I'm swiping.\n\n189\n00:09:50.093 --> 00:09:51.297\nSwipety-swipe-swipe.\n\n190\n00:09:51.297 --> 00:09:58.480\n[LAUGH] The challenge here is that,\nthe likelihood of this happening.\n\n191\n00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.570\nNow I suspect the chief executive\nofficer ultimately got fired over this.\n\n192\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.550\nDidn't know they were in the same network.\n\n193\n00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.230\nShould they have been?\n\n194\n00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.820\nAbsolutely not.\n\n195\n00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.990\nThe air conditioning system\nshould be on a separate network\n\n196\n00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.880\nthat was physically segregated\nfrom the point of sell network.\n\n197\n00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.020\n&gt;&gt; I think a lot of people\nat that point and time,\n\n198\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.520\nit wasn't very\n&gt;&gt; Comment where they thought, they're not\n\n199\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.680\ngonna go after us, they're gonna go after\ngovernments and the big fish but no,\n\n200\n00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.000\nthat was really an eye opener for a lot of\nconsumers on the consumer side of things.\n\n201\n00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.650\n&gt;&gt; So, here on this particular slide,\n\n202\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.470\nthe author of the slide assumed\nthat the likelihood was likely.\n\n203\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:36.990\nNow, I would suggest that when before\nthis breach happen, people at Target.\n\n204\n00:10:38.188 --> 00:10:38.856\n&gt;&gt; It didn't share that same opinion-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK].\n\n205\n00:10:38.856 --> 00:10:41.410\n&gt;&gt; No, they didn't have that same opinion.\n\n206\n00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.340\nThe attacker knew that target\nhad a massive network and\n\n207\n00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.830\nmany potential holes and that they\ncould gain a wealth and information.\n\n208\n00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:54.660\nBut, I doubt that the attacker actually\nknew that until they broke in.\n\n209\n00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:59.100\nBecause, I would expected the.\n\n210\n00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.480\nThe point of sale network\nshould have been segregated.\n\n211\n00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.380\nBut they broke in, and\nthey did some searching.\n\n212\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.360\nAnd that's what you do\nwhen you're hacking,\n\n213\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.120\nis you're trying to find weaknesses,\ntrying to find points of access.\n\n214\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.290\nAnd they found a point of access into\nthe point of sale area of the network, and\n\n215\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.880\nwere able to impact it.\n\n216\n00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.510\nAnd the impact was major and yeah,\n\n217\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:29.010\nI mean if you propose to\nTarget's executives that somehow,\n\n218\n00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.890\nsomeway somebody could break into\nthe point of sale networks and\n\n219\n00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.850\nthen place malware onto the machines that\ncould then report all this information to\n\n220\n00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.260\nthem They would view that as\na major impact and it had major\n\n221\n00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.300\nconsequences, so this gives you a-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n222\n00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.910\nI think their risk matrix probably\nchanged after that event, right?\n\n223\n00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And you can come back and revisit.\n\n224\n00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.190\nIt's not something you\nwant to go ahead and\n\n225\n00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.060\nperform a risk analyses one time only and\never.\n\n226\n00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:01.600\nYou want to revisit it periodically or\nafter a large event like that may happen.\n\n227\n00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.520\nSo what do you think?\n\n228\n00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.240\nYou think we're-\n&gt;&gt; I think that you showed us a good tool\n\n229\n00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.050\nand explained how we can go ahead and\ncategorize the likelihood, the probability\n\n230\n00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:17.360\nand then the impact that this risk\nposes for a company or organization.\n\n231\n00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.780\nSo we have that tool available to us now.\n\n232\n00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.290\n&gt;&gt; One final comment relative to this,\n\n233\n00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.400\nwhat this is is\n&gt;&gt; They have this thing called\n\n234\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.050\nquantitative analysis and\nthey have qualitative analysis.\n\n235\n00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:34.340\nAnd this is really qualitative,\nbecause we're using fuzzy sort of words\n\n236\n00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:39.467\nlike low and medium and\nhigh as opposed Those to 1.0 1.5.\n\n237\n00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:43.540\n&gt;&gt; Right, because if we look at\nthose words quantitative and\n\n238\n00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.490\nqualitative, the way I always remember\nSteve is quantitative like a quantity.\n\n239\n00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.170\nQuantity means the number\nof something right?\n\n240\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.550\nAnd usually when you're,\nwhen we're talking about qualitative\n\n241\n00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.480\nI don't always have that numbers.\n\n242\n00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.700\nSo quantitative, like quantity there's\nalways a number that I can use.\n\n243\n00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.190\nSo if I say,\nthis laptop is worth a thousand dollars.\n\n244\n00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.710\nWell, that's a number,\nthat's attach to it and\n\n245\n00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:14.500\nI have the receipt to prove that, but\nqualitative if you hurt my feelings.\n\n246\n00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.295\nWhat's that worth?\n\n247\n00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.010\n[LAUGH] You know?\n\n248\n00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.070\nThat's qualitative.\n\n249\n00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.670\nThere's a little wiggle room there.\n\n250\n00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.680\nBut with qualitative, it's a number, it's\na fact, it's in black and white there.\n\n251\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.090\nSo that's how I remember it.\n\n252\n00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and again this is sort of fuzzy,\n\n253\n00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.559\nbecause we really don't know\nwhat the difference is.\n\n254\n00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.360\nWe only got three choices here.\n\n255\n00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.630\nWe got low, medium, and high.\n\n256\n00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.280\nAnd that may not be enough definition when\nwe're actually going through and doing-\n\n257\n00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.210\n&gt;&gt; Sure, this is a very basic, but\n\n258\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.800\njust so you guys understand the concept.\n\n259\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.160\nNow there are tons of different matrices\nout there that can be pretty in-depth,\n\n260\n00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.360\nbut we don't need to know\nthat at this point in time.\n\n261\n00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.260\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n262\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.620\nSo I think we pretty well\nbeat the risk assessment and\n\n263\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.740\nthe rest of the information to death\ngoing to the level we want to go to but\n\n264\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.570\nthis point in-\n&gt;&gt; That's okay,\n\n265\n00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.170\nyou guys are getting some\nreally good information here so\n\n266\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:03.470\ndon't go anywhere, stay tuned,\nwe have a lot more headed your way.\n\n267\n00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.130\nThank you for bearing with us.\n\n268\n00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.350\nSo we'll go ahead and wrap it up for\nthis episode and I'm your host [INAUDIBLE]\n\n269\n00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.790\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:15.843\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, cyber patriots,\nto another online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:15.843 --> 00:00:18.212\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:23.570\nIn this episode, we're gonna be taking a\nlook at cyber threats and countermeasures.\n\n7\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.660\nSo I can only imagine that we're gonna be\nlooking at different types of threats that\n\n8\n00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.680\nare out there, and then what we can\ndo to go ahead and protect ourselves.\n\n9\n00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.030\nToday, we have Professor Steve Linthicum\nto go ahead and explain the different\n\n10\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.470\ntypes of countermeasures that we have\navailable to these different threats.\n\n11\n00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.480\nThank you for being with us today, Steve.\n\n12\n00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.740\n&gt;&gt; I think you'll find as students that\nthis a little bit easier to digest than\n\n13\n00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.130\nthe last section because it makes\ncommon sense to you and to me.\n\n14\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.020\nSometimes that risk stuff doesn't\nexactly make a lot of sense.\n\n15\n00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.635\nSo we'll go through and\nstart out with the first slide here.\n\n16\n00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:57.265\nAnd this is physical threats.\n\n17\n00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:58.865\nThe first one is dumpster diving.\n\n18\n00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:02.401\nNow you look at that and you're probably\nwondering, well what is dumpster diving?\n\n19\n00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.585\nAnd it is exactly what it says.\n\n20\n00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:10.685\nIt is going into dumpsters and pulling\nout data that's on paper, basically.\n\n21\n00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:13.526\nAnd this is a common problem.\n\n22\n00:01:13.526 --> 00:01:16.530\nThere's some really cool emails out there.\n\n23\n00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.410\nI mean not emails,\n\n24\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.040\nthere are some really cool videos out\nthere that talk about dumpster diving and\n\n25\n00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.680\nthe techniques, made much easier\ntoday with something like this.\n\n26\n00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680\nMeaning that I don't actually\nhave to dive into the dumpster,\n\n27\n00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.900\nI can start taking pictures of\nstuff that's in the dumpster.\n\n28\n00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.550\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to haul\nthem off like this guy.\n\n29\n00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou really don't have to haul them off.\n\n30\n00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.663\nYou convert them into a data file that\nexists on an iPhone, for example.\n\n31\n00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:42.049\nAnd so that's really what it is,\n\n32\n00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.340\nis finding information\nthat's been thrown out.\n\n33\n00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.370\nThat's outside of the security protection\nof a business or a government entity.\n\n34\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.300\nAnd then taking pictures of it, and\n\n35\n00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.960\nlooking at the data that's\non that documentation.\n\n36\n00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.610\nVery, very simple, and\nit's a common characteristic that we have.\n\n37\n00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.360\nWe throw things away,\nwe like to throw things away.\n\n38\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.220\nWe just don't carefully throw them away.\n\n39\n00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.760\nWe don't shred them, and\nwe should be shredding.\n\n40\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.040\nBut I can guarantee that\nif you go to a dumpsite and\n\n41\n00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.970\nlook at paper, you're gonna find paper out\nthere that has Social Security numbers and\n\n42\n00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.810\nthe other personal identifiable\ninformation on it.\n\n43\n00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.630\nAnd here you are trying to\nprotect your own PII, and yet\n\n44\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.040\nyour doctor's office is not.\n\n45\n00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.980\nWe wouldn't want that obviously.\n\n46\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.990\nThe next item down here is shoulder\nsurfing, and what this is all about is if\n\n47\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.610\nyou pretend that somebody is standing\nbehind me, or if I go over here.\n\n48\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.118\nAnd let me see if we can get the,\nand I go like this.\n\n49\n00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:42.010\n&gt;&gt; What's Steve doing?\n\n50\n00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.365\n&gt;&gt; I'm at the airport and-.\n\n51\n00:02:44.365 --> 00:02:46.467\n&gt;&gt; Hum-dee-dum.\nI'm typing in my password.\n\n52\n00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:50.367\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, I see she's got Bank\nof America up on her site and\n\n53\n00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:52.370\nshe's on the login page.\n\n54\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.211\nAnd I see her type her username and her\npassword, something that she doesn't catch\n\n55\n00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:01.585\nme doing because she thinks I'm playing\nPokemon or something behind her.\n\n56\n00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:02.687\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n57\n00:03:02.687 --> 00:03:05.250\nwhat I'm doing is I'm\nrecording those key strokes.\n\n58\n00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.070\nI'm recording them in video.\n\n59\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.450\nAnd these modern day\nphones have such clarity.\n\n60\n00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.780\nTheir pictures have so many megapixels\nin them that I can enlarge it, and\n\n61\n00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.590\nI can identify that that\nfinger is moving up to the u.\n\n62\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.840\nThat sort of activity and\nthe whole sequence,\n\n63\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.490\nthat way I can get her password and\nusername and break in to her account.\n\n64\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.490\nSo that's a physical threat,\none we don't think about,\n\n65\n00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.180\nbecause flying to present here,\n\n66\n00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.520\nit was a long flight, and there was a big,\nlong break at the Atlanta airport.\n\n67\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.230\nAnd all I could do was just sit there and\nveg, and open my computer.\n\n68\n00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.650\nAnd I'm not paying attention\nto what's going behind me.\n\n69\n00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.510\nSo maybe what I should be paying attention\nto is where I'm sitting, and make sure\n\n70\n00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.090\nthat I'm sitting against a wall, perhaps\nnot a window because of the reflection.\n\n71\n00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.750\nSo, we-\n&gt;&gt; Don't they make privacy filters,\n\n72\n00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.290\nlike glare, to reduce that viewing angle?\n\n73\n00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.345\nIf I were in airports often,\nwhich I'm not, but.\n\n74\n00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:03.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but\n\n75\n00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.450\nit's another piece to carry with you.\n\n76\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.480\n&gt;&gt; This is true, yeah.\n\n77\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so the challenge is, and it's not-\n&gt;&gt; Just be aware of your surroundings?\n\n78\n00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.190\n&gt;&gt; It's not in that particular case\nthat I'm really looking at the screen.\n\n79\n00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.094\nI'm looking at what\nyour fingers are doing.\n\n80\n00:04:16.094 --> 00:04:16.969\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n81\n00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:21.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so just be aware,\nit's all about awareness.\n\n82\n00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.678\nSituational awareness is critical\nrelating to physical threats.\n\n83\n00:04:25.678 --> 00:04:26.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n84\n00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n85\n00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.030\nSo let's go on.\n\n86\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.040\nCyber hygiene, basic personal practices,\nkeep computers and data safe.\n\n87\n00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.570\nLock your computer when\nyou're in public areas.\n\n88\n00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.560\nShield your password\nwhen you're typing it.\n\n89\n00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.970\nNow it's a challenge to be a touch\ntypist and have your hand over it.\n\n90\n00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.415\nYou're trying to go like this to hide.\n\n91\n00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:46.787\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To hide what you're doing.\n\n92\n00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.910\n&gt;&gt; Well they even say that at gas pumps,\nright?\n\n93\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.080\nTo go ahead and kind of use one hand\nto cover what you're inputting.\n\n94\n00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, next one is pretty obvious.\n\n95\n00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.467\nDon't let strangers use your computers and\nkeep sensitive-\n\n96\n00:04:56.467 --> 00:04:58.083\n&gt;&gt; But why not, it's an emergency?\n\n97\n00:04:58.083 --> 00:04:58.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah well,\n\n98\n00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.085\nyou're not touching my computer, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:05.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Aw.\n&gt;&gt; I have my whole life on here.\n\n100\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.470\nAnd that's an important aspect.\n\n101\n00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.410\nI have my whole life on here, and\nI also have whole disk encryption,\n\n102\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.272\nmeaning that if somebody steals my laptop,\n\n103\n00:05:16.272 --> 00:05:21.370\nthey're gonna be real challenged in\ngetting to the data that is in storage.\n\n104\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.214\nWe talked about data in transit,\nit should be encrypted.\n\n105\n00:05:24.214 --> 00:05:29.513\nData in storage should also be\nencrypted to protect its safety.\n\n106\n00:05:29.513 --> 00:05:34.230\nSo if somebody steals my computer,\nguess what?\n\n107\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.137\nThey're gonna have a real challenge.\n\n108\n00:05:35.137 --> 00:05:36.310\n&gt;&gt; What are using over there?\n\n109\n00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.140\nBitLocker?\n\n110\n00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.330\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n111\n00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.857\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n112\n00:05:39.857 --> 00:05:41.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so but\n\n113\n00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.878\nthere are other product out there\nthat can solve the problem.\n\n114\n00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:49.990\nOkay, so did I cover all those?\n\n115\n00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.622\nWait,\n&gt;&gt; Keep sensitive information in\n\n116\n00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:52.267\nsecure places.\n\n117\n00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:54.760\nI think you did mention that,\nbut let's just make sure.\n\n118\n00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.131\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n119\n00:05:56.131 --> 00:05:57.300\n&gt;&gt; We got sidetracked.\n\n120\n00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.807\n&gt;&gt; You're not gonna keep,\nfor example, your silver\n\n121\n00:06:01.807 --> 00:06:05.750\nselection or\nyour gold coins that you have.\n\n122\n00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.070\nYou're not gonna keep them in\nyour top drawer of your dresser.\n\n123\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.200\nThe obvious reason is some crook will\ncome in there and steal them, right?\n\n124\n00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.405\nSo, you want to keep stuff\nthat is important to you.\n\n125\n00:06:16.405 --> 00:06:18.470\nAnd obviously information is.\n\n126\n00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Like just not sitting in plain site,\nmaybe on the back seat of a vehicle.\n\n127\n00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.777\nSo that someone could just smash that\nwindow, grab the whole laptop, and\n\n128\n00:06:25.777 --> 00:06:27.110\nthere you go, data breach.\n\n129\n00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.470\n&gt;&gt; You're right, exactly.\n\n130\n00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.370\nWhat are mobile devices?\n\n131\n00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.725\nI suggest that we don't need to\nspend a great deal of time on this,\n\n132\n00:06:34.725 --> 00:06:37.667\nbecause everyone is familiar\nwith this line of devices.\n\n133\n00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:40.030\n&gt;&gt; At least seen them if you\ndon't have a few of your own.\n\n134\n00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.330\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and this world is becoming mobile,\nand guess what?\n\n135\n00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.850\nTheft of mobile is easier.\n\n136\n00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:46.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're small.\n\n137\n00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're small.\n\n138\n00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.920\nI can go by your desk and I can pick up\nyour phone and throw it in my pocket and\n\n139\n00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.130\nwalk out the door.\n\n140\n00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.440\nIt's that easy.\n\n141\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.990\nSo be careful with portable\ndevices that contain data.\n\n142\n00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:04.050\nAnd these are powerful, powerful computers\nand contain a lot of your personal data.\n\n143\n00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.620\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n144\n00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.550\n&gt;&gt; So be very careful.\n\n145\n00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.070\nMake sure that your device is encrypted.\n\n146\n00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.170\nWe've gotten to a point with products,\nwith mobile phones for example,\n\n147\n00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.770\nwhere virtually all of\nthem now are encrypted.\n\n148\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.190\n&gt;&gt; They provide that option.\n\n149\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is an option.\n\n150\n00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.020\nYou initiate the option on an Apple\nsimply by putting in the passcode, and\n\n151\n00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.330\nthat automates the process.\n\n152\n00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.280\nAnd nobody says you have\nto use four numbers, okay?\n\n153\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:36.240\nBecause it's pretty simple after\na while to try all of the combinations.\n\n154\n00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.480\nAnd so you wanna use a little\nbit more complex password,\n\n155\n00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.190\nbecause of the sensitive nature\nof the data and its availability,\n\n156\n00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:49.160\nmeaning the availability of\nthe physical device to be stolen, okay?\n\n157\n00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.895\nSo mobile devices, here we are,\nI should have come to the slide before I\n\n158\n00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:55.338\nsaid easily stolen and\nlost because they are.\n\n159\n00:07:55.338 --> 00:07:58.208\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's all right,\nwe're gonna recover it again.\n\n160\n00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:02.508\n&gt;&gt; Should be encrypted,\nbut sometimes they aren't.\n\n161\n00:08:02.508 --> 00:08:06.129\nTo give you an example,\none of my devices isn't.\n\n162\n00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:07.330\nBut I don't have much on it.\n\n163\n00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.560\nIt's my Amazon Fire device that I\nuse to purchase things on Amazon.\n\n164\n00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.679\nAnd I also use it cuz it's kind of\na convenient sort of device for\n\n165\n00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:19.030\naudio books, which I really like.\n\n166\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.800\nSo I'm not so concerned with\nthe fact that it's not encrypted.\n\n167\n00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.600\nBecause if somebody steals it,\nwill they get to listen to my audiobooks?\n\n168\n00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.940\nThat's about the only thing\nthat's really important on there.\n\n169\n00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.640\nTargets of malware.\n\n170\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.740\nThat's a risk associated with\nnot just Windows computers.\n\n171\n00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.370\nThere seems to be a misnomer\nout there that the only\n\n172\n00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.030\nmachines you have to worry\nabout is your Windows computer.\n\n173\n00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.650\nAnd that's not true.\n\n174\n00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.598\nWe're seeing more and\nmore targeted hardware.\n\n175\n00:08:48.598 --> 00:08:53.710\nLinux machines, Apple products,\n\n176\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.280\nthey're all getting to be more targeted.\n\n177\n00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.620\nEverybody is just not\npicking on Bill Gates.\n\n178\n00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.030\nCan be compromised via wireless.\n\n179\n00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.230\nAnd this is a huge issue.\n\n180\n00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.770\nWireless.\n\n181\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.720\nSafe to view wireless as being wide open,\ngenerally.\n\n182\n00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.090\nWhen we think about wireless,\nhow do you access it?\n\n183\n00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.400\nWell, it's information going\nacross the airwaves and\n\n184\n00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.200\nwe all have access to the airwaves.\n\n185\n00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.540\nPhysically.\n\n186\n00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.830\nIt's a challenge to keep all\n\n187\n00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.022\nthe signals that are going out\ninside of the geographic area.\n\n188\n00:09:31.022 --> 00:09:32.970\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and there's quite\na realm of different frequencies.\n\n189\n00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.220\nWe're not just talking WiFi,\nwireless fidelity.\n\n190\n00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.188\nMost of these devices come integrated with\nBluetooth, so we're seeing an increase,\n\n191\n00:09:40.188 --> 00:09:43.430\nan uptick on the different components\nwe have to think about, here.\n\n192\n00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n193\n00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.045\nAnd to give you a sense, the standard 802,\n\n194\n00:09:49.045 --> 00:09:53.268\nI'm trying to think of the Wi-Fi standard.\n\n195\n00:09:53.268 --> 00:09:54.166\n&gt;&gt; 802.11?\n\n196\n00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:57.413\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 802.11, b, g.\n\n197\n00:09:57.413 --> 00:09:58.930\n&gt;&gt; All of our standards, yeah.\n\n198\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.153\n&gt;&gt; All those standards.\n\n199\n00:10:01.153 --> 00:10:05.040\nThe length,\nthe distance that that signal travels.\n\n200\n00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.790\nAnd historically records have been\nset where you go from a high mountain\n\n201\n00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.060\nto a high mountain and\nI think that we're almost up to 100 miles.\n\n202\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.740\nWhere a standard sort of\nsignal that is not amplified\n\n203\n00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.940\nbeyond the limitations that the FCC\nallows can travel that far.\n\n204\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.550\nNow, they're using highly\ndirectional antennas.\n\n205\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe don't have access to all that [LAUGH].\n\n206\n00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.940\n&gt;&gt; But I do know, that a number of years\nago I bought a product that was called\n\n207\n00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.630\na cantenna,\nthat looked like a Pringle can.\n\n208\n00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.410\n&gt;&gt; I've made one before, yeah.\n\n209\n00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.235\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nI bought one.\n\n210\n00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:37.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm cheap, so, yeah.\n\n211\n00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.750\n&gt;&gt; And where I'm from, we've got\nSan Francisco, and we've got Oakland.\n\n212\n00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.810\nAnd people with cantennas\nhave been able to-\n\n213\n00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.050\n&gt;&gt; Increase that view, the signal.\n\n214\n00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.610\nYeah, so you're able to go ahead and\nhave access to wireless that your normal\n\n215\n00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.670\ndevices wouldn't have\nwithout the extra antenna.\n\n216\n00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.280\n&gt;&gt; Right, so don't assume that you're\nsafe anywhere on a wireless network.\n\n217\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.690\n&gt;&gt; From a distance standpoint.\n\n218\n00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, from a distance standpoint.\n\n219\n00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.690\nSo you need to have some sort of\nan encryption associated with it.\n\n220\n00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.890\nAnd the quality of the encryption\nhas improved over time.\n\n221\n00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.990\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean that it\nis as secure as we would like it to be.\n\n222\n00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.100\nSo wireless systems can be compromised.\n\n223\n00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.560\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n224\n00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.710\n&gt;&gt; And you can have things put on your\nmachine that would collect information\n\n225\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.780\nlike keyloggers,\nphysical devices, or software.\n\n226\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.310\nSo you gotta guard against these sorts of-\n&gt;&gt; Spyware is something we have to\n\n227\n00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.400\nthink about.\n\n228\n00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nyou've got to guard against these things.\n\n229\n00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.290\nThey go down here on the fix side,\nfor these risks.\n\n230\n00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.560\nAnd they tell you to guard your device.\n\n231\n00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.100\nThat means that\n&gt;&gt; Keep an eye on it.\n\n232\n00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.070\n&gt;&gt; Keep an eye on it.\n\n233\n00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.720\nDon't leave the room and\nleave it on a table, for example.\n\n234\n00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.610\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; For encryption devices.\n\n235\n00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.095\nFirst of all, have encryption software and\n\n236\n00:11:51.095 --> 00:11:55.473\nhave strong passwords associated with\nany access to the encrypted devices.\n\n237\n00:11:55.473 --> 00:11:58.550\nUse anti malware, keep everything updated.\n\n238\n00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.970\nAvoid using open networks\nin a wireless environment.\n\n239\n00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.140\nWhen we talk about open networks,\n\n240\n00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.680\nthat means that all you have\nto do is open up your machine.\n\n241\n00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:14.560\nAnd there are no safeguards denying\nyou access to that network.\n\n242\n00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.130\nSo when you go into Starbucks,\nconsider that an open network.\n\n243\n00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n244\n00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.990\n&gt;&gt; And\nbe careful with what you're accessing.\n\n245\n00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:27.920\nAnd then for your machine in general,\ncustomize your security settings.\n\n246\n00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.323\nJust don't accept the default.\n\n247\n00:12:29.323 --> 00:12:29.875\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n248\n00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:30.375\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n249\n00:12:32.077 --> 00:12:33.509\nOnline threats.\n\n250\n00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:35.455\nSocial engineering.\n\n251\n00:12:35.455 --> 00:12:37.975\nI'm not gonna spend a great\ndeal of time on this.\n\n252\n00:12:37.975 --> 00:12:41.465\nJust know that people are out there\nthat want to manipulate you and\n\n253\n00:12:41.465 --> 00:12:43.555\nyou're a human being and\n&gt;&gt; That's the first word that I was\n\n254\n00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:44.875\nthinking of, a manipulator.\n\n255\n00:12:44.875 --> 00:12:48.465\n&gt;&gt; And you're subject to being\nmanipulated, so be careful when you get\n\n256\n00:12:48.465 --> 00:12:54.069\nthat Nigerian princess or prince,\ndon't necessarily accept what they say.\n\n257\n00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:55.740\n&gt;&gt; Believe it to be true, yeah.\n\n258\n00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.310\nOkay, and\nthese are examples of social engineering.\n\n259\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.630\nWe have phishing, and\nwe have spear-phishing.\n\n260\n00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.860\nPhishing is\n&gt;&gt; Opportunistic.\n\n261\n00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.710\nWe're just hoping.\n\n262\n00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:07.790\nWe are sending out.\n\n263\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:12.300\nMaybe I bought a list of\nemails from the dark web,\n\n264\n00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.650\nand I just wanna go ahead and spam.\n\n265\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.370\nAnd I'm just hoping,\nit's like a numbers game.\n\n266\n00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.930\nI'm hoping someone will respond and\nclick on my malware.\n\n267\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.610\nAnd then you look at spear phishing.\n\n268\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.650\nAnd maybe I don't like Steve,\nmaybe I just have a grudge.\n\n269\n00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.240\nAnd I'm really targeting,\nI'm going after Steve.\n\n270\n00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.050\nI may not even know his email address.\n\n271\n00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.490\nI'm gonna go ahead and send him that\nemail directly to his account there.\n\n272\n00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.860\nSo I don't know, what do you think?\n\n273\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.798\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nwe've got different degrees, but\n\n274\n00:13:38.798 --> 00:13:42.380\noftentimes spear-phishing is\ndirected at corporate leadership.\n\n275\n00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.890\nWe're trying to get to somebody\nin a high level responsibility.\n\n276\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.082\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you hear that term whaling\nbecause those are the big fish, right?\n\n277\n00:13:49.082 --> 00:13:50.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are the big fish.\n\n278\n00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.050\nExactly.\nAnd\n\n279\n00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.800\nthen we've got vishing which\nyou don't much hear about but\n\n280\n00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:59.000\nit's basically trying to get personal\nidentifiable information over the phone.\n\n281\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.310\nAnd smishing, you're using texting based\nupon SMS, which is a protocol for texting.\n\n282\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.560\nSo same basic thing-\n&gt;&gt; Just different methods.\n\n283\n00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.800\n&gt;&gt; It's phishing using\ndifferent communications\n\n284\n00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.970\nmethods-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n285\n00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.269\n&gt;&gt; I think,\nis probably the way to look at it.\n\n286\n00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.560\nThis is an example of a phishing email.\n\n287\n00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.500\nI know we've all received\nthese sorts of things.\n\n288\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:27.520\nDon't believe what it says,\nif it's a bank or the IRS.\n\n289\n00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.640\nCuz the IRS-\n&gt;&gt; IRS is not going to call you or\n\n290\n00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.560\nemail you, and the FDIC is not\ngoing to call you or email you.\n\n291\n00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.970\nYou're gonna receive registered mail.\n\n292\n00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.040\nSo that's how they will go and\ncontact you.\n\n293\n00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.559\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nAnd-\n\n294\n00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:39.820\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft's not gonna call you.\n\n295\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.270\nI've had a lot of people say,\nyou know the Microsoft called me,\n\n296\n00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.240\nsaid I have an error,\nI have a virus on my computer.\n\n297\n00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.270\nNo, they're not gonna call you.\n\n298\n00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.790\n&gt;&gt; They're not gonna call you.\n\n299\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.820\nAnd if for example,\nyou get an email from a bank.\n\n300\n00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.382\nWhat you should be looking for is\ninstructions to log on to their website.\n\n301\n00:14:56.382 --> 00:15:00.460\n&gt;&gt; Or, you could even call their website\nand say, Hey, I received this email.\n\n302\n00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.980\nTell them what it says,\nis this legit, or not?\n\n303\n00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and chances are, it isn't.\n\n304\n00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they should have a fraud\ndepartment to go ahead and verify for you.\n\n305\n00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:13.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwhen you get these sort of email scams,\n\n306\n00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.610\nyou can report them out but\ndon't respond to them.\n\n307\n00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, definitely not.\n\n308\n00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:21.530\n&gt;&gt; And that's a key component here,\ndo not answer it.\n\n309\n00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.970\nJust don't answer it.\n\n310\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.500\nJust do not answer it, but\ngo ahead and report it.\n\n311\n00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.960\nContact the party to whom It\nsuggests it's from perhaps,\n\n312\n00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.580\nif it's from [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Like if you receive a fake Paypal email\n\n313\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.340\nand they say, we noticed you\nhaven't logged on in three months,\n\n314\n00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.990\nplease enter your username and\npassword now to verify your account.\n\n315\n00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.660\nDon't do it.\n\n316\n00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.640\nDon't ever click those\nembedded hyperlinks.\n\n317\n00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.870\nYou might want to call Paypal and say,\n\n318\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.870\nhey I got this message, I just wanted\nto let you guys know about it.\n\n319\n00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:53.391\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and we get hit with these\nall the time, believe me, anymore.\n\n320\n00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:55.452\nSo we've got malware, what is it?\n\n321\n00:15:55.452 --> 00:15:58.050\nWell malware is just malicious software.\n\n322\n00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.951\nIt's software that's designed and\nwritten to steal information from you,\n\n323\n00:16:01.951 --> 00:16:04.480\nto spy on you,\nto gain control of your computers.\n\n324\n00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.100\nSo it's categorized basically on\nhow it spreads and what it does.\n\n325\n00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.110\nThose are the key components.\n\n326\n00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.340\nSo let's talk about some of this malware.\n\n327\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.550\nWe've got viruses and worms.\n\n328\n00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.737\nThe way that I differentiate\nbetween viruses and\n\n329\n00:16:20.737 --> 00:16:22.844\nworms is all worms are viruses.\n\n330\n00:16:22.844 --> 00:16:27.146\nThat's a safe assumption but\nwhat happens with viruses is\n\n331\n00:16:27.146 --> 00:16:32.059\nif you get a virus on your machine and\nit will infect your machine but\n\n332\n00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:38.330\nit's not part of an automated process to\nattack other machines with that virus.\n\n333\n00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:42.400\nIt doesn't automatically spread and\nit requires user interaction.\n\n334\n00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.920\n&gt;&gt; It requires that host, yeah and\nif you think about what if you got sick?\n\n335\n00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.150\nSteve you got a virus.\n\n336\n00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.890\nYou're infecting that host.\n\n337\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.600\nThe virus is infecting you.\n\n338\n00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.508\nVery similar,\nwhereas a worm is very similar but\n\n339\n00:16:55.508 --> 00:16:59.331\nit doesn't require\nthe presence of that host.\n\n340\n00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:01.316\n&gt;&gt; And they can spread across a network,\nreal problematic.\n\n341\n00:17:01.316 --> 00:17:03.480\n&gt;&gt; Very detrimental to organizations.\n\n342\n00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.520\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n343\n00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.210\nTrojan Horses and I know we\ntalked about this in the past but\n\n344\n00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:12.030\nit's basically a useful program and\nhas some useful benefit to you but\n\n345\n00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.120\nit carries an extra payload\nwhich is not beneficial.\n\n346\n00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.773\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nif you've ever heard the story of Troy and\n\n347\n00:17:17.773 --> 00:17:21.891\nthey have that false horse statue,\nthat's exactly where this term comes from.\n\n348\n00:17:21.891 --> 00:17:25.515\nBecause it's something that's packaged or\nrepresented as something but\n\n349\n00:17:25.515 --> 00:17:29.210\nit might have something hidden\ninside of it like that horse did.\n\n350\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.591\nRight, zombies and botnets.\n\n351\n00:17:31.591 --> 00:17:33.345\nBoy, we're seeing a lot of this lately and\n\n352\n00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.882\ndistributed denial of servers attacks\n&gt;&gt; Sure, a couple\n\n353\n00:17:35.882 --> 00:17:40.905\nof Fridays ago blacked down a huge portion\nof North America, the entire East Coast.\n\n354\n00:17:40.905 --> 00:17:44.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nwhat happens here is that computers,\n\n355\n00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.020\nlots of computers get\ninfected with software.\n\n356\n00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.720\nAnd when I'm talking about computers, I'm\ntalking in the broad sense of that term.\n\n357\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.250\nThat doesn't necessarily mean, as a I look\nat my laptop, that this is a computer.\n\n358\n00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.920\nIt is, but so\n\n359\n00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.320\nis that Internet of Things device hanging\non a wall controlling temperatures.\n\n360\n00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.670\n&gt;&gt; All these devices with IP addresses\nconnecting out to the public network,\n\n361\n00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.250\nthe Internet, and yeah.\n\n362\n00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:07.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n363\n00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.887\nYeah, so\nwhat happens is that these devices,\n\n364\n00:18:11.887 --> 00:18:16.896\nthese computers and\neverything out there is a computer,\n\n365\n00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:22.133\ngot infected and\ntheir function is to team up, in essence.\n\n366\n00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:25.083\nThey get commands from a command\ncenter that is a computer\n\n367\n00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:28.658\nrunning control software that\ncontrols the actions of all of these.\n\n368\n00:18:28.658 --> 00:18:31.235\n&gt;&gt; Like a herder sometimes.\n\n369\n00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:34.045\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, of these zombies or bot nets.\n\n370\n00:18:34.045 --> 00:18:39.090\nAnd it instructs them at\na specific instance to attack.\n\n371\n00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:39.740\n&gt;&gt; A trigger?\n\n372\n00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; A time of day or specific event, yeah.\n\n373\n00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.630\nAnd we'll take a look at this\na little more in depth I think Steve.\n\n374\n00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:46.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz yeah\n\n375\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.182\nit's definitely something that\nwe do need to talk about.\n\n376\n00:18:48.182 --> 00:18:52.610\n&gt;&gt; Right, and then the next one is\nkeyloggers and this is logging keystrokes.\n\n377\n00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:56.190\nSo it's either hardware or software\nthat somebody comes into your office and\n\n378\n00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:00.460\nthey pull out the connector to your\nkeyboard and they plug in a keylogger.\n\n379\n00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.250\n&gt;&gt; Well sure if you think about it,\nif I have a desktop, am I\n\n380\n00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.759\nlooking behind my computer every day when\nI get to work and checking the back of it?\n\n381\n00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.250\nProbably not to be honest.\n\n382\n00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:14.600\nOkay so that's why they're still\neffective and they definitely evolved.\n\n383\n00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.140\nIt's not just basic keyloggers any more,\n\n384\n00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.180\nwe see all sorts of\nthing like screenshots.\n\n385\n00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.360\nSending those images back to the attacker.\n\n386\n00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.430\nIt's getting pretty bad.\n\n387\n00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.140\n&gt;&gt; And then we have backdoors and\n\n388\n00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.520\nthese are typically access\npoints provided by programmers.\n\n389\n00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.770\nWhen they're creating programs and\nthen they don't close that back door.\n\n390\n00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.830\nThey need the back door for\nease of modification or-\n\n391\n00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.140\n&gt;&gt; They might just forget about them.\n\n392\n00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.570\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so they're uncovered,\nsomebody looks through the coding and\n\n393\n00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.532\n[CROSSTALK] determines\nthe opportunity to enter.\n\n394\n00:19:45.532 --> 00:19:50.710\nAnd an unauthorized entry point would be\nthe way that I would look at a back door.\n\n395\n00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.260\nLogic and time bombs.\n\n396\n00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.910\nThese are basically a virus\nsitting in the background.\n\n397\n00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.650\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like I was talking about\nwhen I mentioned that term, trigger,\n\n398\n00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:05.260\nthat you would use a logic bomb or a time\nbomb in conjunction with a zombie or\n\n399\n00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.570\nbot robot network, a botnet there.\n\n400\n00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.050\nSo you would say, okay guys,\nthey would be unsuspecting.\n\n401\n00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.560\nAnd we'll look at that, like I said,\na little bit later here.\n\n402\n00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n403\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.088\nAnd then, finally, Spyware, and Spyware\nis generally associated with looking\n\n404\n00:20:19.088 --> 00:20:21.425\nat what you're doing and reporting it.\n\n405\n00:20:21.425 --> 00:20:22.283\n&gt;&gt; Like those key loggers but\n\n406\n00:20:22.283 --> 00:20:24.396\nmaybe even a little more advanced\nto your Windows screenshots.\n\n407\n00:20:24.396 --> 00:20:28.782\n&gt;&gt; Right, you'll see things like,\none thing,\n\n408\n00:20:28.782 --> 00:20:33.740\na good piece of spyware is\none that takes snapshots.\n\n409\n00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n410\n00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.392\n&gt;&gt; And collects them and then sends\nthem off to whoever it's sending\n\n411\n00:20:37.392 --> 00:20:40.575\nthem off to and they can see what\nyou've been doing on your screen.\n\n412\n00:20:40.575 --> 00:20:44.152\n&gt;&gt; Certain intervals, maybe every five\nminutes, maybe they set them more,\n\n413\n00:20:44.152 --> 00:20:45.640\neven more than that, so yeah.\n\n414\n00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.053\nRight, I think that's\na good introduction here.\n\n415\n00:20:49.053 --> 00:20:51.910\nWe've looked at quite a bit so\nfar for this episode.\n\n416\n00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.730\nLet's go ahead and wrap up for\nthis one but don't go anywhere,\n\n417\n00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.420\nwe have a lot more with we're\ntalking about our malware and\n\n418\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.080\nour actual implementations of that so\nstay tuned.\n\n419\n00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.610\nWe have more headed your way.\n\n420\n00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.760\nThat about wraps it up for this episode,\nI'm your host Cherokee Boost.\n\n421\n00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.318\n&gt;&gt;

to\nanother online training video.\n\n7\n00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:17.656\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose, and\n\n8\n00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:22.930\nin this episode we're gonna be taking a\nlook at cyber threats and countermeasures.\n\n9\n00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.260\nNow, if you've been following along,\n\n10\n00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.450\nyou'll notice that we already talked\nabout this in the previous episode but\n\n11\n00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.500\nthere's a lot to cover so we're gonna go\nahead and have Professor Steve Linthicum\n\n12\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.730\ngo ahead and break it down for us at that\nlevel and really detailed information.\n\n13\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.560\nSo what are gonna go ahead and\ntake a look at here, Steve?\n\n14\n00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.690\nWhat we are gonna do is look at those\nterms that we looked at in the past,\n\n15\n00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.420\nthe previous episode.\n\n16\n00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.470\nAnd we're going to go through\nthem in a little bit more detail.\n\n17\n00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.420\nWe're gonna drill down.\n\n18\n00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.890\nOkay.\nSo that you have a better understanding.\n\n19\n00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.120\nSo let's, again, we had that list up.\n\n20\n00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.580\nAnd there's a whole list of items here.\n\n21\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.610\nSo we're gonna start out with viruses and\nworms, and\n\n22\n00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.350\ngo into a little bit more detail.\n\n23\n00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.290\nAnd we'll do the same with the other ones.\n\n24\n00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.120\nSo the first one here is viruses.\n\n25\n00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.710\nNow we talked about this a bit.\n\n26\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.810\nBut what happens with viruses is they\ncan spread from one machine to another,\n\n27\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.850\nbut they require user\ninteraction to do that.\n\n28\n00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.140\nMeaning, they infect a machine and\nthen they need for you to do something.\n\n29\n00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.760\nAnd they give an example of a virus here,\na well-known virus.\n\n30\n00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.270\nThis was, if I can look back in time,\nprobably I would say about 2005.\n\n31\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.303\nYeah, I don't remember what year.\n\n32\n00:01:28.303 --> 00:01:29.265\nIt was a while ago.\n\n33\n00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:30.275\nThe I Love You virus.\n\n34\n00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:31.186\nIt was a long, yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:34.950\nAnd they kinda play in that psychological\nrealm here because people want to be\n\n36\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.710\nloved, right?\n\n37\n00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.580\nSo they're like, who sent me this and\nthey'll click on it [LAUGH].\n\n38\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.610\nSo you actually, and\nI remember getting these attachments.\n\n39\n00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.230\nAnd I remember what it did to\nthe network at my college,\n\n40\n00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.380\nwhich basically brought it to its knees.\n\n41\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.290\nVery detrimental.\n\n42\n00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.210\nYeah, is there was a mass mailing to\nall of the employees at Sierra College.\n\n43\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.650\nAnd a number of them\nwere really interested.\n\n44\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.300\nAnd who would send them\nan email that says I love you?\n\n45\n00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.400\nI guess they don't feel loved.\n\n46\n00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.820\nI don't know quite what it was.\n\n47\n00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.435\nI know I did not click on it,\nI know I did not.\n\n48\n00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:08.815\nBut what happened is\npeople would click on it.\n\n49\n00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:13.005\nAnd it would effectively\ninfect their email,\n\n50\n00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:15.625\ntheir list of contacts and their email.\n\n51\n00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:18.465\nAnd it would send out a bunch of emails,\neffectively.\n\n52\n00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:20.925\nSo with this I Love You virus on it.\n\n53\n00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:23.430\nAnd so it was emails.\n\n54\n00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.940\nClick on it, sends after all of\nyour context and all of a sudden,\n\n55\n00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.300\nthey're getting an email from you.\n\n56\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.830\nAn embarrassing email for\nyou because it says I love you and\n\n57\n00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.370\nnow you love all your contacts.\n\n58\n00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.145\nYeah, you're like stevious that\nneeds this I love you email.\n\n59\n00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:40.870\n[LAUGH] But no,\nit really wasn't Steven back,\n\n60\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.920\nit was that virus acting\non Steve's behalf there.\n\n61\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.660\nRight.\n\n62\n00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.520\nAnd so, we use that as\nan example of viruses, worms.\n\n63\n00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.940\nAs I mentioned earlier in the previous\nvideo, they are really viruses.\n\n64\n00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.710\nBut they can infect without\nthis human assistance.\n\n65\n00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.820\nMeaning, a worm hits a machine on your\nvirus and it automatically jumps,\n\n66\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.830\nthat worm's virus jumps from machine\nto machine to machine to machine.\n\n67\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.070\nSo it only takes an introduction\nof that worm into your network and\n\n68\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.990\nthen it can be spread without any\nparticipation by human being so\n\n69\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.080\nit is really a disaster when you\nThe number one thing we want to do when we\n\n70\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.260\nsuspect any kind of malware is\njust get that system off at work.\n\n71\n00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.071\nBecause fixing one system is a heck of\na lot easier than what you have in this\n\n72\n00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:27.950\ndiagram here.\n\n73\n00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.054\nGeez, 500 machines right?\n\n74\n00:03:30.054 --> 00:03:34.013\nSo that's what we try to do here\non the right side is that worm and\n\n75\n00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:36.867\non the left side is our virus malware Yes.\n\n76\n00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:38.240\nExactly.\n\n77\n00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.530\nOkay so let's look at this next slide and\nthis is the Trojan Horse and\n\n78\n00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.460\nof course that standard\nimage of the Trojan Horse.\n\n79\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.500\nAnd basically, what happened is\nthat we have a legitimate and\n\n80\n00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.380\nI use that term a functioning,\n\n81\n00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.430\nI guess I shouldn't use legitimate\nbecause Trojan Horses are not legitimate.\n\n82\n00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.290\nBut it's a program that you desire to put\non your machine because it has a parent\n\n83\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.400\nuseful function that you can use.\n\n84\n00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.560\nAnd you put it on there and\nit does its useful function but\n\n85\n00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.080\nit does an unuseful function.\n\n86\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.640\nAlso.\nYeah,\n\n87\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.200\nyou gave us a really good example, Steve.\n\n88\n00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.240\nBefore, when you had mentioned a game.\n\n89\n00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.860\nIf you're downloading a free game online,\nsure.\n\n90\n00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.420\nI download this game.\n\n91\n00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.260\nI can play it.\n\n92\n00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.680\nI can up levels.\n\n93\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.290\nBut also, I might have got something\nelse packaged into that game as well.\n\n94\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.130\nAnd while we don't classify them as trojan\nhorses, if you go some sites where they\n\n95\n00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.010\nprovide downloading freeware,\nbe concerned as you're going through\n\n96\n00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.410\nthe agreement to effectively\ninstall that on your computer.\n\n97\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.309\nOftentimes, you'll see things that\nyou actually need to uncheck.\n\n98\n00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.750\nThere are, for example, search engines.\n\n99\n00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.390\nYeah, slow down and read.\n\n100\n00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.900\nYeah, read, and start unchecking things\nbecause yes, you may want that really cool\n\n101\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.570\nscientific calculator because you need\nit and it really works great, and\n\n102\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.860\nit is a great piece of software, but it's\nfree and the reason it's free is because.\n\n103\n00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.800\nIt's being paid for\n\n104\n00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.660\nby the fact that you're downloading\nother programs onto your machine.\n\n105\n00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.230\nYeah, have you ever seen those systems\nwith like five different tool bars at\n\n106\n00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.990\nthe top of their browser, and you're\nlike wait a minute what did you install?\n\n107\n00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.150\nYes, exactly, so\nbe careful of Trojan horses.\n\n108\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.593\nFree is often not free,\nI guess is a good way Yeah.\n\n109\n00:05:30.593 --> 00:05:31.243\nto say it.\n\n110\n00:05:31.243 --> 00:05:32.609\nAnd be careful what you download.\n\n111\n00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:37.170\nAnd make sure, one of the things\nyou can do is you can check online.\n\n112\n00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.120\nPerhaps do a google search, see if\nother people have had problems with it.\n\n113\n00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.800\nBut the problem is oftentimes,\n\n114\n00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.820\nthere will be postings up there that say\nwhat a great piece of software it is.\n\n115\n00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.110\nSure.\nSo you gotta be careful\n\n116\n00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.700\nin checking things out, making sure that\nyou're getting legitimate responses.\n\n117\n00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.300\nUsually, if it seems too good to be true,\nit usually is.\n\n118\n00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.000\nThat's a very accurate statement.\n\n119\n00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.360\nOkay.\nSo\n\n120\n00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.880\nthey give you examples of what can happen.\n\n121\n00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.390\nYour computers could crash.\n\n122\n00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.620\nVariety of things associated\nwith trojan horses.\n\n123\n00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.110\nHuge.\nIf you have any.\n\n124\n00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.380\nWhen you're talking troubleshooting\ncomputer systems, if you ever see\n\n125\n00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.430\nanything that doesn't really fit the mold,\nand you've checked all the hardware,\n\n126\n00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.340\ndon't ever underestimate the fact\nthat it could be malware here.\n\n127\n00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.460\nSo.\n\n128\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.090\nAnd there's a firm belief out there\nby many security experts that\n\n129\n00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.470\nwhen your machine is infected and\n\n130\n00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:34.040\nyou make efforts to uninfect it\nyou can never be absolutely sure.\n\n131\n00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.280\nAnd so what you may have to resort to\nis reinstalling the operating system.\n\n132\n00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.090\nSure, I feel that way with\ncertain types of virsues.\n\n133\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.640\nThere are certain low level\nvirsues that it's best,\n\n134\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.420\nin my opinion,\nI'm gonna just redo the system.\n\n135\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.280\nAnd after you spend hours\ntrying to get rid of that virus\n\n136\n00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.170\nyou'll probably reach that same conclusion\nthat- And no, and here's the thing.\n\n137\n00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.880\nYou think you've done it.\n\n138\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.240\nAnd you're shouting yay or\ndoing your little congratulatory dance.\n\n139\n00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.780\nAnd then two weeks later you\nsee the same symptoms and\n\n140\n00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.350\nyou just- at that point you kinda got to\ndecide is it worth my time and effort.\n\n141\n00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.280\nOr Should just reimage this system.\n\n142\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.633\nThat's why backups are so\nimportant, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n143\n00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:10.944\n[LAUGH] And back in the old days,\n\n144\n00:07:10.944 --> 00:07:15.650\nmachines actually would have instances\nwhere they would do nothing.\n\n145\n00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.550\nAnd that's not true anymore,\n\n146\n00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.690\nwith what's going on where there's\ntimes where your computer is not busy.\n\n147\n00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.950\nThose are opportunities for\n\n148\n00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.060\nyour Operating system to do indexing and\nother activities.\n\n149\n00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.200\nSo even though, and and you could tell\nwhen you have a virus in the past.\n\n150\n00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.070\nYou can't necessarily tell now because\neven though you're not busy doing things\n\n151\n00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.950\non your computer.\n\n152\n00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.370\nIt could well be running\nautomated processes designed\n\n153\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.390\nto use that slack time\nto upgrade your machine.\n\n154\n00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.360\nDo a variety of things.\n\n155\n00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.700\nSo you can't really tell when it's a virus\nand when it isn't, based upon activity.\n\n156\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.790\nSo, sometimes it's just better to reimage.\n\n157\n00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:55.337\nI agree.\n\n158\n00:07:55.337 --> 00:08:00.068\nOkay, malware, zombies and botnets.\n\n159\n00:08:00.068 --> 00:08:04.678\nZombies, it's compromised computers\nunder the control of an attacker.\n\n160\n00:08:04.678 --> 00:08:06.070\nWe mentioned that earlier.\n\n161\n00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.574\nIt makes it possible for\n\n162\n00:08:07.574 --> 00:08:12.250\nsomeone else to control your computer\nfrom anywhere in the world, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.440\nSo it effectively becomes\nthis walking dead.\n\n164\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you hear this term, a zombie,\na drone, because essentially if\n\n165\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.390\nI sent you an email Steve, and you clicked\non the attachment, it was malware.\n\n166\n00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:28.182\nYou downloaded some malicious\ncoding onto your system,\n\n167\n00:08:28.182 --> 00:08:30.237\nnow I can control your system.\n\n168\n00:08:30.237 --> 00:08:30.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n169\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.941\n&gt;&gt; That's your zombie, your drone.\n\n170\n00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:35.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But, what if I did that times 100?\n\n171\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.300\n&gt;&gt; Then what is it called, Steve?\n\n172\n00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.256\n[LAUGH] Let's take a look at our slide.\n\n173\n00:08:38.256 --> 00:08:42.722\n&gt;&gt; It's a collection of\ncompromised computers, zombies,\n\n174\n00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:45.440\nunder the control of an attacker.\n\n175\n00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.700\n&gt;&gt; Which would be a botnet.\n\n176\n00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:52.290\n&gt;&gt; Right, and these are the current\nrage relative to attacks.\n\n177\n00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.310\nDesigned to keep particular machines busy.\n\n178\n00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:00.490\n&gt;&gt; One of the things that happened\nI think here in your area was,\n\n179\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:04.860\nthere was a denial of\nservice attack against a DNS,\n\n180\n00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.330\ndomain name system, set of computers.\n\n181\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.640\nAnd what happens with your\ncomputer is when you type\n\n182\n00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.530\nin ITPRo.TV in your browser window.\n\n183\n00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.820\nWhat your computer does,\nis it doesn't know what ITPRoTV is,\n\n184\n00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.960\nit doesn't know it's location.\n\n185\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.980\nAnd so what it does is it contacts\na DNS server out there, and asks it.\n\n186\n00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.810\nWhat is the IP address for ITProTV?\n\n187\n00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.790\nAnd then your computer reaches\nout to that IP address.\n\n188\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.542\nWell, what happened with this\ndenial of service attack that was\n\n189\n00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:44.559\ndirected specifically at a system\nof DNS servers, is it kept them so\n\n190\n00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:50.293\nbusy that they couldn't answer your\nrequest for the IP address for ITPRoTV.\n\n191\n00:09:50.293 --> 00:09:54.406\nSo all you got was just kind\nof a spinning sort of thing.\n\n192\n00:09:54.406 --> 00:09:58.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's kind of like our DNS\nservers are like phone books, right?\n\n193\n00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.673\nBecause like you've said, I use a web\naddress ITPRoTV or where is my logo,\n\n194\n00:10:02.673 --> 00:10:07.615\nover here, [LAUGH] but computers they\ndon't speak English, they speak binary.\n\n195\n00:10:07.615 --> 00:10:12.431\nSo, they look at those numbers and until\nI can find alternative DNS servers to\n\n196\n00:10:12.431 --> 00:10:16.650\ngive me the correct information,\nI can't reach out anywhere.\n\n197\n00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:17.463\nI don't know who to call.\n\n198\n00:10:17.463 --> 00:10:20.029\nYou guys probably have never\neven seen a phone book, though.\n\n199\n00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:23.759\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I used to always describe DNS servers\n\n200\n00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:26.153\nas when you would dial 411.\n\n201\n00:10:26.153 --> 00:10:27.480\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n202\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.460\n&gt;&gt; Then I entered a middle\nschool classroom,\n\n203\n00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.510\nand I saw all these blank faces.\n\n204\n00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.131\n&gt;&gt; They're like, yeah, what's 411?\n\n205\n00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:34.468\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What is 411?\n\n206\n00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:36.600\nAnd what it is, for\nthose of you who don't know,\n\n207\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.910\nis when you didn't know somebody's number,\nyou would dial 411 and give their name.\n\n208\n00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.660\nGive the person on the other side,\n\n209\n00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.820\nif there was a person, and\nit may have been automated.\n\n210\n00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.998\nThe name and the address and then that\nway, you could get the phone number in\n\n211\n00:10:49.998 --> 00:10:53.794\nreturn, and that's kind of the way\nDNS works is we give them a name.\n\n212\n00:10:53.794 --> 00:10:55.486\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's so like you mentioned,\n\n213\n00:10:55.486 --> 00:10:58.762\nit wasnt a direct attack on ITProTV\nthat brought us down a few weeks ago,\n\n214\n00:10:58.762 --> 00:11:01.290\nbrought down most of the East Coast\nas a matter of fact.\n\n215\n00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.818\nIt was an attack on a DNS provider\nthe company was called Dying DNS.\n\n216\n00:11:05.818 --> 00:11:10.498\nAnd by removing that one provider,\nthat one tool that we use,\n\n217\n00:11:10.498 --> 00:11:17.320\nthese companies were essentially crippled\nfor a large majority of an entire day.\n\n218\n00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.480\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n219\n00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.260\nSo let's go on.\n\n220\n00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.250\nKeyloggers, again,\nI think we talked about this.\n\n221\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.810\nBut there are generally two different\nsort of devices that are used.\n\n222\n00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.080\nOne is a hardware and one is software.\n\n223\n00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n224\n00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.840\nthe hardware is a physical device that's\nactually connected between where your\n\n225\n00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.930\ncord for your keyboard plugs into\nyour computer, and your computer.\n\n226\n00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.982\nAnd somebody could crawl under the desk\nand do that, and you would never know it,\n\n227\n00:11:44.982 --> 00:11:48.343\nbecause how often do you-\n&gt;&gt; Unless you're visually inspecting your\n\n228\n00:11:48.343 --> 00:11:52.480\nwork station, and sometimes I've even seen\nlittle tiny USB dongles that they could\n\n229\n00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.300\nput on the backside of your systems.\n\n230\n00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.420\nAnd unless you're actually\nchecking every single day,\n\n231\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.230\nthen that's why they're effective\nbecause people don't always check.\n\n232\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.478\n&gt;&gt; People don't check,\nit's not don't always check [LAUGH].\n\n233\n00:12:04.478 --> 00:12:06.837\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n234\n00:12:06.837 --> 00:12:08.704\nWhen is the last time you\ncrawled under a desk and\n\n235\n00:12:08.704 --> 00:12:10.158\nlooked at the back of your computer?\n\n236\n00:12:10.158 --> 00:12:11.768\n&gt;&gt; I haven't even used\na desktop in forever.\n\n237\n00:12:11.768 --> 00:12:15.234\nSo yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n238\n00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:18.560\n&gt;&gt; And then of course,\nwe have the software method.\n\n239\n00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.185\nAnd hopefully with the software method,\n\n240\n00:12:21.185 --> 00:12:24.940\nyour virus protection sort of\nsoftware would pick that up.\n\n241\n00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.660\nWe would hope that it would do that.\n\n242\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.560\n&gt;&gt; That's why we have our layers and\n\n243\n00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.840\nI'm sure we'll talk about that later,\nabout our defense in depth.\n\n244\n00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:37.234\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and then a back door is again,\nI think we talked about this, but\n\n245\n00:12:37.234 --> 00:12:42.267\nthis is something that a programmer\ntypically leaves in place.\n\n246\n00:12:42.267 --> 00:12:47.920\nAnd it should have been removed before\nthe software was publicly disseminated.\n\n247\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.605\nAnd somebody learns about\nit by researching, and\n\n248\n00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:56.968\nthey use that as an entry point, and\nmalware can use it as an entry point.\n\n249\n00:12:56.968 --> 00:12:59.780\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nWe try to test the code\n\n250\n00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.620\nas much as we can before it gets released,\nlike you said to the public.\n\n251\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.750\nBut sometimes,\nlet's face it, life happens.\n\n252\n00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.380\nYour boss is yelling at you.\n\n253\n00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.810\nHey, you're past due on this deadline,\nwe need to go ahead and release that.\n\n254\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.450\nIt happens.\n\n255\n00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, and it's not just backdoors.\n\n256\n00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.620\nThere are a lot of lack of security\nfeatures that result in the patching that\n\n257\n00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.430\nwe see constantly going on.\n\n258\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.600\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and it doesn't always\nmean that it's bad coding.\n\n259\n00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.560\nI mean, look, we got a cat and mouse game.\n\n260\n00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.750\nSomeone's always trying to break what\nthose programmers are developing.\n\n261\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.120\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and of course,\nthey were rushed to market.\n\n262\n00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.180\nBecause, if-\n&gt;&gt; Time is money.\n\n263\n00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, time is money.\n\n264\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:42.200\nAnd so oftentimes, software is released\narguably before it should be released.\n\n265\n00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.140\nBut you have to get it out there so\nthat it's an income source for\n\n266\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.890\nthe company that's\ndeveloping the software,\n\n267\n00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.469\nwith the idea that it will\neventually solve the weaknesses.\n\n268\n00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.920\nThe logic time bombs,\nthese are malware that's designed to\n\n269\n00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.800\nbasically sit dormant on a machine,\nand some event will trigger it.\n\n270\n00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.660\nA common triggering event might be, for\nexample, April 1st, April fool's day.\n\n271\n00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:13.740\nThat's a specific date, or\nif a particular person logs in.\n\n272\n00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.250\nOr a message is received, and\n\n273\n00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.735\nthese sorts of things can trigger\nthis Malware to start to function.\n\n274\n00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:25.494\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you think back to what we\njust were talking about with our botnets.\n\n275\n00:14:25.494 --> 00:14:29.446\nLet's say I wanted to perform an attack\non you, Steve, on your birthday,\n\n276\n00:14:29.446 --> 00:14:32.610\nbecause I just wanted you to\nhave a really crummy birthday.\n\n277\n00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.600\nI don't know why I would do that.\n\n278\n00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.680\nBut let's just say I sent malware out and\nI controlled it,\n\n279\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.440\nand I was building up my army.\n\n280\n00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.200\nI got a couple hundred\nzombies within my army.\n\n281\n00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.170\nI have my zombie army now.\n\n282\n00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.650\nNow on your birthday,\nI'm gonna have them go ahead and\n\n283\n00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.680\nprovide some type of distributed\ndenial of service to you.\n\n284\n00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.207\nAnd now your birthday's not so nice.\n\n285\n00:14:53.207 --> 00:14:54.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, your birthday is not so nice.\n\n286\n00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:57.454\nThat's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's another way we can see\n\n287\n00:14:57.454 --> 00:15:01.160\nlogic or time bombs being used there.\n\n288\n00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthe next light up is about spyware and\n\n289\n00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.840\nit collects information about you\nwithout your knowledge and consent.\n\n290\n00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.460\nWe talked about keyloggers earlier and\n\n291\n00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:13.850\nthat's an example of\nthe software version of spyware.\n\n292\n00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.731\nBut it can be, even tracking\nyour patterns where you going.\n\n293\n00:15:18.731 --> 00:15:21.761\n&gt;&gt; That's true and I think you had\nkind of touched on that before Steve,\n\n294\n00:15:21.761 --> 00:15:25.540\nwhen you talked about adware and you said,\nlook it depends on who you're talking to.\n\n295\n00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.720\nSome people say it's a benign\nform of spyware, but\n\n296\n00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.470\nI guess that's all relative as to\nhow important your privacy is.\n\n297\n00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.620\nI don't know if you guys have\never been surfing online.\n\n298\n00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.956\nLet's say you go to a store and\nyou're looking for a pair of shoes.\n\n299\n00:15:38.956 --> 00:15:42.336\nThen you login to Facebook and you see\nan advertisement the next day with, hey,\n\n300\n00:15:42.336 --> 00:15:43.914\nthose are the shoes I was looking at.\n\n301\n00:15:43.914 --> 00:15:49.435\nOkay, that's an example of benign, meaning\nit's not malicious really in any way,\n\n302\n00:15:49.435 --> 00:15:54.804\nbut tracking your activity can help market\nthose products to you a little easier for\n\n303\n00:15:54.804 --> 00:15:57.047\nthese companies so they use that.\n\n304\n00:15:57.047 --> 00:16:00.442\n&gt;&gt; Well, and\nto give you a beneficial example.\n\n305\n00:16:00.442 --> 00:16:04.926\nLet's say that I'm interested in tools,\nmechanical tools and\n\n306\n00:16:04.926 --> 00:16:09.741\nI go to, I'm gonna use as an example\nSears, and so when go to Sears and\n\n307\n00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:14.971\nI look at tools then if I move over and\nlet's say it's Kmart, well there's\n\n308\n00:16:14.971 --> 00:16:20.980\na relationship between Kmart and Sears and\nthat Sears owns Kmart or Kmart owns Sears.\n\n309\n00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.880\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So they share this information, and\n\n310\n00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.830\nyou would expect them to.\n\n311\n00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:30.410\nAnd so when I go to the Kmart website,\nguess what pops up on the initial webpage?\n\n312\n00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.400\n&gt;&gt; The same tool.\n\n313\n00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthey're having a sale on tools at Kmart.\n\n314\n00:16:33.885 --> 00:16:37.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now that's sort of a benign beneficial\n\n315\n00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:42.200\napproach, but believe me,\nthis information is being shared not by\n\n316\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.779\nthe solely companies that they own-\n&gt;&gt; Sure\n\n317\n00:16:43.779 --> 00:16:44.570\n&gt;&gt; by the same entity.\n\n318\n00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.810\n&gt;&gt; More than you would want or\nmore than you think really.\n\n319\n00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:50.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, more than you would think and\nsome of it's beneficial and\n\n320\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.600\nsome of it probably not so beneficial.\n\n321\n00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.614\nBecause you wouldn't like your\nbuying pattern sometimes,\n\n322\n00:16:56.614 --> 00:16:58.810\ndepending upon on what you're buying.\n\n323\n00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.842\nI don't care that you know I buy tools,\nbut\n\n324\n00:17:00.842 --> 00:17:03.339\nthere may be things that I\nmight not want you to know.\n\n325\n00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:04.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n326\n00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.650\nAnd so this is all kind of\na challenging privacy area.\n\n327\n00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.830\n&gt;&gt; So how do we stop this from happening?\n\n328\n00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.550\nSteve, what are some things that we can\ndo to prevent all of this malware from\n\n329\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.680\ncoming onto my system?\n\n330\n00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, first of all,\nyou've got to keep your machines patched.\n\n331\n00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.430\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; You've got to keep them current and\n\n332\n00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.140\nup to date relative to patches.\n\n333\n00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.740\nWith regard to the sort of spyware, or\nwhere you were talking about going from\n\n334\n00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.620\nSear's to, you have cookies that\nare installed when you hit a page so\n\n335\n00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.040\nyou can instruct your browser,\nyou can make the security modification so\n\n336\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.000\nthat cookies are not maintained.\n\n337\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.190\nBut that gets to be kind of a pain\ntoo because there are beneficial\n\n338\n00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.030\naspects that we could.\n\n339\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:43.070\n&gt;&gt; Some websites don't function properly\nwithout the use of third party cookies.\n\n340\n00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.790\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n341\n00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.619\n&gt;&gt; So.\nSo it's, [SOUND].\n\n342\n00:17:45.619 --> 00:17:48.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have to make those\njudgement calls sometimes.\n\n343\n00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.470\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n344\n00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:55.800\nobviously you need to be running\nsome sort of anti-malware software.\n\n345\n00:17:57.365 --> 00:18:02.435\nAnd there are lots of good discussions\nrelative to virus protection and\n\n346\n00:18:02.435 --> 00:18:05.635\nits necessity,\nparticularly in a Windows environment.\n\n347\n00:18:05.635 --> 00:18:09.335\nIt always used to be a mandate for\nWindows until\n\n348\n00:18:09.335 --> 00:18:13.600\nWindows Microsoft built in it's own-\n&gt;&gt; Addressing that problem.\n\n349\n00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.920\n&gt;&gt; Issue, yeah.\n\n350\n00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.880\nIt's own product that comes\nwith Windows at no cost.\n\n351\n00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.790\n&gt;&gt; Just make sure that's called, what?\n\n352\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:20.500\nWindows Defender.\n\n353\n00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Defender.\n&gt;&gt; Windows Defender,\n\n354\n00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.610\nmake sure it's enabled.\n\n355\n00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.760\nAnd let me tell you Steve, on my personal\ncomputer, this is my work computer, but\n\n356\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.510\non my personal laptop.\n\n357\n00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.210\nI've been using Windows Defender,\nknock on wood here, and\n\n358\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.420\nI haven't had a problem with it.\n\n359\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.550\nSo I don't have anything\nnegative to say about it.\n\n360\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.870\n&gt;&gt; And I would tend to agree with you.\n\n361\n00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.960\nThe problem with a lot of\nthese purchased products\n\n362\n00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.314\nis that they do a lot of things\nthat slow your machine down.\n\n363\n00:18:43.314 --> 00:18:44.980\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Are there a lot of resources?\n\n364\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.650\n&gt;&gt; Very proud resource-intensive, yeah.\n\n365\n00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:48.560\n&gt;&gt; And that gets to be kind of a pain and\n\n366\n00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.940\nthen periodically it's doing things\nthat I don't particularly, I'm busy.\n\n367\n00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.950\nI need to have access\nto all the resources.\n\n368\n00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.990\nAnd yet a McAfee product or\na Symantec product or.\n\n369\n00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.015\n&gt;&gt; Is hogging your CPU.\n\n370\n00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:00.920\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n371\n00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.380\nAnd you're wondering\nwhat the heck's going on.\n\n372\n00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.590\nBehind the scenes and\nthat's probably what's going on.\n\n373\n00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:11.200\nSo and also one of the challenge\nis there is a lot of\n\n374\n00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.920\nvirus protection is signature based.\n\n375\n00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.136\nAnd so it really doesnt protect you\nagainst viruses that are not part of that\n\n376\n00:19:18.136 --> 00:19:18.851\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] discovered yet.\n\n377\n00:19:18.851 --> 00:19:22.002\n[CROSSTALK] database, they're signatures.\n\n378\n00:19:22.002 --> 00:19:26.952\n&gt;&gt; So you probably,\nI think you're okay today with just\n\n379\n00:19:26.952 --> 00:19:31.800\nDefender alone,\nI'm still running AVG but it's.\n\n380\n00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's probably habit more than anything.\n\n381\n00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.200\n&gt;&gt; So Steve let me ask you this,\nlet's say I was running Windows Defender,\n\n382\n00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:42.380\nwould I also wanted to run AVG and tandem\nat the same time as Windows Defender?\n\n383\n00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.200\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n384\n00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.560\nThe quick answer is no.\n\n385\n00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.880\nIt's advisable not to run\nmultiple defender solutions.\n\n386\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.530\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and they would be because what?\n\n387\n00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:52.780\nThey see each other?\n\n388\n00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.100\nThey could potentially be\nconflicting with each other,\n\n389\n00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.960\nand essentially canceling each other out,\nthe effectiveness of those programs.\n\n390\n00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.870\nSo we don't want to run real time\nanti-malware software more than one\n\n391\n00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:05.860\nsolution at the time.\n\n392\n00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.017\n&gt;&gt; And one of the things that you need\nto be concerned about also is and\n\n393\n00:20:10.017 --> 00:20:13.240\nwe're going to talk about this\nmore detail when we look at\n\n394\n00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.070\nspecific examples of what you can\ndo to make your machine better.\n\n395\n00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.680\nYou wanna make sure that you are shutting\ndown all processes that don't need to be\n\n396\n00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.240\nrunning all the time, But this is\na service if you're running Defender,\n\n397\n00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.530\nyou're running some third party product\nthat needs to run from startup.\n\n398\n00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.070\nSo you don't wanna remove that\nfrom the startup sequence.\n\n399\n00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.660\nBefore you log onto your machine.\n\n400\n00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.280\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nmost of these will automatically do that.\n\n401\n00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.730\nSo you would have to go in and start\ntinkering with things to disable that,\n\n402\n00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:45.650\nwhich where you see types of armored\nviruses that will actually try to disable.\n\n403\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.120\nI don't know if you guys have\never had any kind of malware and\n\n404\n00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.090\nyou try to run a scan and you can't\nlaunch that anti-malware program.\n\n405\n00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.970\nAnd that's because some viruses have\nbeen coded to prevent you from doing so.\n\n406\n00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.960\n&gt;&gt; Prevent you from getting to Task\nManager, prevent you from doing a variety-\n\n407\n00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.578\n&gt;&gt; They can be a real pain\n\n408\n00:20:59.578 --> 00:21:00.301\n&gt;&gt; Pain sometimes.\n\n409\n00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:00.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n410\n00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.790\nagain we get back to that discussion,\nmaybe it's better to re-image.\n\n411\n00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:05.773\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n412\n00:21:05.773 --> 00:21:07.290\n&gt;&gt; So it gets so sophisticated.\n\n413\n00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.660\n&gt;&gt; Specially like in a business\nenvironment when we said time is money and\n\n414\n00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.350\nyou have to make that judgement call.\n\n415\n00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.860\n&gt;&gt; And speaking of time is money.\n\n416\n00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.520\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n417\n00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.200\n&gt;&gt; It looks like we've ran out of time for\n\n418\n00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.060\nthis episode guys\n&gt;&gt; But I think that about wraps it up.\n\n419\n00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.130\nWe've covered all the different types of\nmalware that we need to be aware of as of\n\n420\n00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.640\nnow so thank you so much for hanging in\nthere with us, but don't go anywhere,\n\n421\n00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.030\nwe still have some more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n422\n00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.810\nFor this episode, I'm gonna go and\nsign off as your host for the day,\n\n423\n00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.340\nCherokee Boose.\n\n424\n00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.800\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Steve Linthicum.\n\n425\n00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.181\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:15.715\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, cyber patriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n7\n00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.055\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:22.165\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at cyber security and threats.\n\n9\n00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:25.075\nWith us today,\nwe have Professor Steve Linthicum, and\n\n10\n00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:29.865\nhe's gonna go ahead and explore password\npolicies and different types of techniques\n\n11\n00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:34.145\nthat we can implement to really just make\nus a little more stronger in that fields.\n\n12\n00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:35.595\nSo let's go ahead and get started here.\n\n13\n00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:37.700\nThank you for being with us today, Steve.\n\n14\n00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.410\n&gt;&gt; Hi, I think what I wanna talk\nabout relative to passwords,\n\n15\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.180\nis this probably an area of human\nweakness, if I had to characterize it.\n\n16\n00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.710\nSo, we're gonna go through and talk about\nwhat are good passwords, what are not so\n\n17\n00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.040\ngood passwords?\n\n18\n00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.770\nWe'll take a look at some suggestions that\nmaybe helpful for you as you develop your\n\n19\n00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.530\npasswords and as you go through\nthe process of changing them.\n\n20\n00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.020\nSo, on this first slide, Ronald,\nand I wanna say McDonald,\n\n21\n00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.810\nbut CyberPatriot characterizes\nit as Ronald Donald's password.\n\n22\n00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.600\nI think that we can all agree that even\nif it were Ronald McDonald's password,\n\n23\n00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.690\nit's not a very good one because one,\ntwo, three,\n\n24\n00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.810\nfour is fairly obvious,\nit's simple to input.\n\n25\n00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.410\nAll you would have to do is basically\nstart over on your keyboard and\n\n26\n00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.400\ngo four keys over and\nyou could cover your password.\n\n27\n00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.394\nYou could play like a piano does, I guess.\n\n28\n00:01:26.394 --> 00:01:28.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That might be a good reason.\n\n29\n00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.660\n&gt;&gt; Very easy, yeah.\n\n30\n00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very easy password.\n\n31\n00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.430\nSo it's characterized as not good and I\nthink that's an accurate characterization.\n\n32\n00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.800\nYou're gonna find some really\nuseful information that you\n\n33\n00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.440\nprobably would be surprised at.\n\n34\n00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.910\nComplex Passwords,\nthat's the title of this slide.\n\n35\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.820\nAnd if we have an eight\ncharacter password,\n\n36\n00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.930\nand I would say in today's world\nthat's pretty much a minimum.\n\n37\n00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.780\n&gt;&gt; Bare minimum, yeah for sure.\n\n38\n00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, bare minimum on length.\n\n39\n00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.770\nAnd what you're gonna find as we go\nthrough this is length is extremely\n\n40\n00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.380\nimportant.\n\n41\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And extremely beneficial in avoiding\n\n42\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.240\nhaving your password cracked.\n\n43\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.200\nSo if you've got an eight character\npassword and it consist of numbers only.\n\n44\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.600\nThis is numbers only.\n\n45\n00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.380\nThere are a hundred million\npossibilities here.\n\n46\n00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.540\nAnd it would take a brute force attack.\n\n47\n00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.000\nAnd this slide is somewhat updated so\nit would really be faster than this.\n\n48\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.650\nIt could be cracked under one second.\n\n49\n00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.450\nUnder than one second is extremely quick.\n\n50\n00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.520\nSo let's look at the next level.\n\n51\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.271\nThis would be where you have password that\n\n52\n00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:37.350\nconsist of lower case and numbers.\n\n53\n00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.200\nOkay, so\nwhat we're doing is rebuilding them.\n\n54\n00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.260\n&gt;&gt; Increasing that number there and\nthe time.\n\n55\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.520\n&gt;&gt; And so this time we have 2.8\ntrillion different possibilities.\n\n56\n00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.220\nAnd it would take a brute force cracking\nprogram 11 minutes or less, to crack.\n\n57\n00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.980\nNot a very long period.\n\n58\n00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.050\nAnd then we add to that uppercase.\n\n59\n00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.500\nSo, now we have numbers,\nlowercase and uppercase.\n\n60\n00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.120\n&gt;&gt; A good mix.\n\n61\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.360\n&gt;&gt; And it would take.\n\n62\n00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.240\n&gt;&gt; Better mix, I should say.\n\n63\n00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.850\n&gt;&gt; 15 hours.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.200\n&gt;&gt; So, a little longer.\n\n65\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.420\nAnd then we add Symbols and these are the,\nyou can see in the lower example.\n\n66\n00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.490\n&gt;&gt; There are special characters there.\n\n67\n00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.154\n&gt;&gt; What the special characters\nare when we're talking about symbols?\n\n68\n00:03:14.154 --> 00:03:18.647\nIt's not all symbols, it's specifically\ndesigned symbols that are allowed\n\n69\n00:03:18.647 --> 00:03:22.392\ntypically by Windows operating system for\ncomplex passwords and\n\n70\n00:03:22.392 --> 00:03:25.950\nthat would take three weeks to crack or\nunder three weeks.\n\n71\n00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.010\n&gt;&gt; So we wanna have a good mix here,\nright Steve?\n\n72\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.860\n&gt;&gt; Good mix is a good idea, but again\nwe get back to the length of this being\n\n73\n00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.490\nprobably the best preventer of\nyour password being cracked.\n\n74\n00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.680\nAnd so here they give us,\nalways use 3 of the following, numbers,\n\n75\n00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.050\nlower case, upper case and symbols.\n\n76\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.280\nBut you can see that there's a great\nbenefit in adding the symbols to using\n\n77\n00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.460\nthe upper case, lower case and numbers and\nbecause it really brings that up.\n\n78\n00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.410\nWe go from 15 hours to\n3 weeks in duration.\n\n79\n00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.600\nSo they give us an example of Ronald's\nold password and suggested new password.\n\n80\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.000\nWhich does have a sequence\nof numbers in it.\n\n81\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.130\nIt has uppercase, lowercase.\n\n82\n00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.380\nIt's still not very good.\n\n83\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna mention that, Steve.\n\n84\n00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.240\nBecause as a human, and as some human\nbrains think, if I go ahead and start\n\n85\n00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.210\na word or the beginning of a sentence, I\nnormally have a tendency to capitalize it.\n\n86\n00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.930\nSo I noticed in their new password,\n\n87\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.320\nit was a capital P right there\nfrom the onset, capital P.\n\n88\n00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.850\nSo in my mind I wanna be as\nunpredictable as possible.\n\n89\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.310\nSo I might refrain or\nI could incorporate an additional\n\n90\n00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.990\nuppercase letter somewhere\nfurther on down the road.\n\n91\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.830\nAnd they also So put the numbers at\nthe very, well not at the very end.\n\n92\n00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.260\nThey have the exclamation\nmark at the very end.\n\n93\n00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.470\nBut like you said,\nthey were in consecutive order.\n\n94\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.620\nWe still saw one, two, three.\n\n95\n00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.510\nSo maybe I would've suggested to\nkinda mix the numbers up a little bit\n\n96\n00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.570\nbecause it's very common that\nyou see people typing one, two,\n\n97\n00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.710\nthree towards the end\nof that password there.\n\n98\n00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.100\nSo just try to be a little unpredictable,\nright?\n\n99\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.440\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n100\n00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.820\nSo here we go,\nthis gives us just some examples of\n\n101\n00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.720\nrunning brute force attacks where it can\nrun four billion calculations per second.\n\n102\n00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.580\nThat means four billion tries, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.640\n&gt;&gt; So, I'd have to have some pretty\ndecent hardware to go ahead and\n\n104\n00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.860\nperform this high level of calculations.\n\n105\n00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but hardware is getting faster and\nfaster and faster, and more powerful.\n\n106\n00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.970\n&gt;&gt; For cheaper, yeah?\n\n107\n00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.102\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n108\n00:05:28.102 --> 00:05:33.200\n&gt;&gt; So again, this just gives an example,\nif you have a password of six or\n\n109\n00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.640\nfewer characters, a brute force\nattack could be in three minutes.\n\n110\n00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.040\nSeven characters,\nit bumps it up to five hours.\n\n111\n00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.480\nEight characters, we go to three weeks.\n\n112\n00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.340\nNine characters, we're up to five years.\n\n113\n00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.480\nAnd then ten characters, and\nthis is my example of the length.\n\n114\n00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.105\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Look at this, bumps it up to.\n\n115\n00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:53.381\n&gt;&gt; I like this newer,\nthe newer new password.\n\n116\n00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:56.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A little bit better here.\n\n117\n00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.180\nBut I still have a bit of\na qualm with the new password.\n\n118\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.560\n&gt;&gt; And that's because you're\nlooking at the content,\n\n119\n00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.710\nbut typically brute force\nattacks don't look at content.\n\n120\n00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.170\nThey just do tries.\n\n121\n00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.790\nTry this, try this, try this, try this.\n\n122\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.090\nSo they would go through the sequence.\n\n123\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.540\nAnd they might start at A, and\n\n124\n00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.780\nthey might go to B after they\ntry the A and a first character.\n\n125\n00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.570\nSo it's all about the different\ncombinations on a brute force.\n\n126\n00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.350\nIt's not necessarily associated with what.\n\n127\n00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.080\n&gt;&gt; Like a dictionary.\n\n128\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.730\n&gt;&gt; What we would, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Checking for those dictionary words,\n\n129\n00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.580\nlike password.\n\n130\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.540\nI wouldn't want to use the word password,\ncuz password's in the dictionary.\n\n131\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.158\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n132\n00:06:27.158 --> 00:06:30.022\n[LAUGH] Okay?\n\n133\n00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:34.110\nSo not to come as a surprise to you,\ndo not share your password with anyone.\n\n134\n00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.648\n&gt;&gt; I can't see that,\ncan you zoom in a little?\n\n135\n00:06:35.648 --> 00:06:38.920\n[LAUGH] I'm just kidding.\n\n136\n00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.620\nThey put it in really bold lettering here.\n\n137\n00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.340\nIt's really important guys.\n\n138\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.530\n&gt;&gt; Do not share you password with anyone.\n\n139\n00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.290\nBecause guess what,\nyou're making it easier for\n\n140\n00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.170\nthem to log on as you and behave like\nyou wouldn't want them to behave.\n\n141\n00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.900\n&gt;&gt; And they might share it with their\nbuddy and so forth and you don't know.\n\n142\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.370\n&gt;&gt; A secret doesn't really\nexist with two people because\n\n143\n00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.790\neither of them could share it and\nthen it's no longer a secret, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.080\nSo this is a rather surprising slide.\n\n145\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.015\nAny of the top 10,000 passwords\nwill be broken immediately.\n\n146\n00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:16.770\n91% of people have one of\nthe 1,000 most popular passwords.\n\n147\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.130\nAlmost half the people use\nthe hundred top passwords.\n\n148\n00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.340\nAnd then they give us a list here of\nwhat are the standard passwords and\n\n149\n00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.861\nit should come as no surprise to you.\n\n150\n00:07:25.861 --> 00:07:26.587\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Some of these are pretty funny,\nyeah.\n\n151\n00:07:26.587 --> 00:07:29.994\n&gt;&gt; That one of the most\nstandard is password, right?\n\n152\n00:07:29.994 --> 00:07:31.620\nAnd one, two, three, four, five.\n\n153\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.460\n&gt;&gt; Shame shame.\n\n154\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so.\n&gt;&gt; And talk about shame shame.\n\n155\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.150\nSteve you were reminding me about\nwhen Steve Zuckerberg's Twitter\n\n156\n00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.707\naccount was compromised right?\n\n157\n00:07:40.707 --> 00:07:42.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Do you recall what that password was?\n\n158\n00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.806\n&gt;&gt; I think it was dadadada or something.\n\n159\n00:07:44.806 --> 00:07:48.733\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, D A D A DA,\n[SOUND] if he's being crude, I don't know,\n\n160\n00:07:48.733 --> 00:07:51.052\nmaybe that's where he got it from.\n\n161\n00:07:51.052 --> 00:07:52.287\nBut password 101, guys.\n\n162\n00:07:52.287 --> 00:07:54.330\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n&gt;&gt; Take a look here.\n\n163\n00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.320\nWe're not trying to be so common, right?\n\n164\n00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.607\n&gt;&gt; So, as you look at this list,\nif your password is here,\n\n165\n00:07:58.607 --> 00:08:00.961\nI think I'd change it to be\nquite honest with you, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:01.768\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n167\n00:08:01.768 --> 00:08:04.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not a good idea.\n\n168\n00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.356\n&gt;&gt; He changed his password again.\n\n169\n00:08:06.356 --> 00:08:08.061\nLook at that.\n\n170\n00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:13.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, there's some common sense here.\n\n171\n00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.490\nAnd again, link is important.\n\n172\n00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.190\nSo, this a suggestion.\n\n173\n00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.040\nI think a pretty good one.\n\n174\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.170\nOne of the challenges that we have and\nI think we've mentioned this earlier is\n\n175\n00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:29.460\nthe human trait of having a same\npassword for different sites.\n\n176\n00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.650\nSo for example, I use Gmail.\n\n177\n00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.340\nOne of my email accounts is Gmail.\n\n178\n00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.360\nIt's fairly common out there that\nwe would use that sort of stuff.\n\n179\n00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.210\nSo I may have this base password.\n\n180\n00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.100\nThat's easier for me to remember.\n\n181\n00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.574\nI don't want it to be as simple\nas perhaps either of these are.\n\n182\n00:08:48.574 --> 00:08:51.440\n&gt;&gt; And then you modify it\nbased upon that account?\n\n183\n00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.760\n&gt;&gt; Based upon the site.\n\n184\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.390\n&gt;&gt; The site, yeah.\n\n185\n00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.500\n&gt;&gt; So I'll give you an example here.\n\n186\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:02.040\nSo my password for logging in to Gmail\nwould be my normal root password and\n\n187\n00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.930\nthen specifically for Gmail,\nit might be gma at the end of it.\n\n188\n00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.370\n&gt;&gt; Where they're just changing\nthe end of that password here.\n\n189\n00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, well I think they're\nusing the base password and\n\n190\n00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.710\nthen they're adding the gma to it.\n\n191\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.590\n&gt;&gt; The gma and the fac for Facebook,\nyeah that looks like their pattern here.\n\n192\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But the funniest story with\n\n193\n00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:23.200\nthe Facebook that is why or\nhow Mark Zuckerberg was attacked, right?\n\n194\n00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.560\nThe information from LinkedIn database,\nthe password had been leaked online and\n\n195\n00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.240\nthe attacker use Zuckerberg\nleaked password to LinkedIn,\n\n196\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.760\nthey guessed it into his Twitter\naccount and guess what, it worked.\n\n197\n00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.180\nSo he wasn't following this method here,\nwas he?\n\n198\n00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.820\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no.\n\n199\n00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.690\nBut again this is a way to modify\nyour password, to lengthen it,\n\n200\n00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.260\nbecause in each one of these instances\nthey're adding three characters, and\n\n201\n00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.170\nthey're using a different password for\neach site.\n\n202\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.605\nAnd it's easy to remember because\nthe additional information,\n\n203\n00:09:53.605 --> 00:09:54.858\nthe side information.\n\n204\n00:09:54.858 --> 00:09:56.480\n&gt;&gt; Kind of pulls you in.\n\n205\n00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.030\n&gt;&gt; You'd be clued into that.\n\n206\n00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.920\nIt would make sense for my Gmail account\nto add to my normal route password.\n\n207\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.980\n&gt;&gt; Which helps because we have so\nmany passwords.\n\n208\n00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.490\nWe don't want them to become completely\nobscure and all over the place.\n\n209\n00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.785\nWe wanna have some kind\nof way to remember.\n\n210\n00:10:10.785 --> 00:10:13.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I really kind of like this idea.\n\n211\n00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.930\n&gt;&gt; I do too.\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense and for\n\n212\n00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.880\nhuman beings like us, it helps.\n\n213\n00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.930\nIt means that we will not be using\nthe same password on each site.\n\n214\n00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.820\nWe're modifying that password\na bit based upon the site's name.\n\n215\n00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.490\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n216\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.360\n&gt;&gt; Really cool way to do it.\n\n217\n00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.910\nSo here are just a couple clues.\n\n218\n00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:36.430\nThe longer you keep a password, the longer\nattackers have to give it a try and\n\n219\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.460\ntry and crack into it.\n\n220\n00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.800\nAnd we can talk about this and\nprobably should because this is,\n\n221\n00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.270\nas a matter of fact, being subject to\nraising issues relative to businesses.\n\n222\n00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.510\nTypically, for example at my college,\n\n223\n00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.600\nwe have a requirement that we\nchange our password every 90 days.\n\n224\n00:10:54.870 --> 00:11:00.590\nAnd if you go to secure areas, and\nthere's one that I'm familiar with that's\n\n225\n00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:05.650\ngovernment regulated where the password\nrequirement is to change it every 45 days.\n\n226\n00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.520\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And the password length has to be\n\n227\n00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.730\n15 characters or more.\n\n228\n00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.170\nAnd they maintain what's\ncalled a password history and\n\n229\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.470\nwon't allow you to repeat that\npassword for a lot of tries.\n\n230\n00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Meaning you gotta go months and\n\n231\n00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.200\nmonths and months before you could\nconceivably use the same password.\n\n232\n00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.728\n&gt;&gt; Because if I'm an attacker and\n\n233\n00:11:22.728 --> 00:11:26.160\nit's taking me a few months to\nactually crack your password.\n\n234\n00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.430\nIf you use a password that you used\nthe month before, I could essentially,\n\n235\n00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.980\nas the attacker, be working on\nyour old password and crack it.\n\n236\n00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:38.440\nSo by implementing that password\nhistory and not using it again,\n\n237\n00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.770\nI'm just making the possibility of\nthat attacker less possible for\n\n238\n00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.900\nthem to go ahead and\nbreak into my account there.\n\n239\n00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.634\n&gt;&gt; Right, but let's look at the associated\nhuman problem associated with this.\n\n240\n00:11:49.634 --> 00:11:52.146\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we're requiring\n\n241\n00:11:52.146 --> 00:11:53.190\na sixteen-character password.\n\n242\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.374\n&gt;&gt; I see where this is going.\n\n243\n00:11:54.374 --> 00:11:57.900\n&gt;&gt; And we're requiring that\nyou change it every 30 days,\n\n244\n00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.182\nand you can't repeat the password.\n\n245\n00:12:00.182 --> 00:12:02.460\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And it can't contain little clues as to\n\n246\n00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.810\nyour username and a variety of things.\n\n247\n00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.620\nIf we make it so challenging for you to\nmake up passwords and we require this\n\n248\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.990\nrepetition every 30 days or so,\nyou're going to start writing them down.\n\n249\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.810\nThat's the only thing that you can do from\na human being standpoint to remember them.\n\n250\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.820\nWe can't, we're humans.\n\n251\n00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.630\nIt's tough enough remembering things.\n\n252\n00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.490\nAnd if I have to change my password and\n\n253\n00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.730\na weekend goes by, I'm not gonna remember\nit, so I'm gonna write it down and\n\n254\n00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.450\nI'm gonna put it on a sticky\nnote under my keyboard.\n\n255\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.456\n&gt;&gt; No you're not Steve.\n\n256\n00:12:33.456 --> 00:12:34.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n257\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.140\n&gt;&gt; I'm just showing that this is not.\n\n258\n00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:37.650\n&gt;&gt; I know, you see.\n\n259\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:38.780\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps the.\n&gt;&gt; It happen all the time and\n\n260\n00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.720\nthat's what we don't wanna see happen.\n\n261\n00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so,\n\n262\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.780\nthere is a lot of discussion going in\nthe security community as to whether or\n\n263\n00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:52.120\nnot requiring these password changes over\na period of time make a lot of sense.\n\n264\n00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.340\nMaybe it would be better to have this big,\nlong,\n\n265\n00:12:54.340 --> 00:13:00.410\ncomplex password that is going to take\nthem forever to do a brute force attack.\n\n266\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.640\nAnd that way you'll be able to remember\nit, because you're gonna use it for\n\n267\n00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.350\na year or so.\n\n268\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.470\n&gt;&gt; I think passwords are starting to,\nuser names and\n\n269\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.750\npasswords, are starting to\nexceed its life expectancy,\n\n270\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:14.080\nbecause you do see a lot of researchers\ncoming up with alternative methods.\n\n271\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.240\nYou even hear, we won't go too off tangent\nhere, but subconscious computing or\n\n272\n00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.310\nparanoid computing,\n\n273\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.880\nwhere we're even looking at playing\nlittle games to enter into systems.\n\n274\n00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.450\nBecause it's something that's\nhappening in our head.\n\n275\n00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.710\nThe way we respond to games instead\nof remembering that password.\n\n276\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.770\nBecause like we talked about\nthe vulnerabilities there.\n\n277\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.460\nI could share my password with you, Steve.\n\n278\n00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.830\nOr with you and who's to say that\nthat password isn't gonna leak out.\n\n279\n00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.320\nSo, I know.\n\n280\n00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.210\n&gt;&gt; So the slide tells us to change\nour password on a regular basis to\n\n281\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.270\nfoil cracking attempts.\n\n282\n00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.390\nBut again, who knows,\nmaybe that's not the best sort of advice.\n\n283\n00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.750\nPasswords are inherently problematic.\n\n284\n00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.390\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; The method that we're using,\n\n285\n00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.670\nthis single factor authentication\nis probably not the way to go.\n\n286\n00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:00.230\nIf we leave this discussion with anything\nat all, make sure for critical accounts\n\n287\n00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:04.050\nlike your bank that you have some\nsort of two factor authentication.\n\n288\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:09.420\nThe method that my bank uses, I think is\na very effective one and that is if they.\n\n289\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.630\n&gt;&gt; A lot of companies,\nAmazon, Google, Microsoft,\n\n290\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.330\nthey're jumping on this bandwidth\nbecause they're seeing how effective and\n\n291\n00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.490\nhow important it really is\n&gt;&gt; So again,\n\n292\n00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.080\nand in the last bullet here it says\nto change it every few months.\n\n293\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.120\nMaybe yes, maybe no, okay?\n\n294\n00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.130\nI'm undecided to that.\n\n295\n00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.390\nAnd don't use dictionary words.\n\n296\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.500\nI know you've been harping on this a bit.\n\n297\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.772\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And don't use dictionary words.\n\n298\n00:14:30.772 --> 00:14:31.830\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n299\n00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:37.380\n&gt;&gt; And make up passwords where you have,\nthey've got where's the beef now?\n\n300\n00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:42.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is another one that I'm\nnot 100% on because here's the thing.\n\n301\n00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.080\nYou know about this slang,\nthis lingo, these leet words,\n\n302\n00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.790\nthese substitutions that we see here.\n\n303\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:51.870\nSo if I'm familiar with changing the\nletter E to backwards three essentially.\n\n304\n00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:52.700\nI know about it.\n\n305\n00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.380\n&gt;&gt; Or two, or four.\n\n306\n00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.110\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n307\n00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.816\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The attackers probably know about that\n\n308\n00:14:57.816 --> 00:15:02.491\nas well and there are different dictionary\nlists that you can download online with\n\n309\n00:15:02.491 --> 00:15:03.860\nthese substitutions.\n\n310\n00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.630\nSo, you just wanna be careful\nnot to be too predictable.\n\n311\n00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.978\nThere's that term again\nthat I must love that term.\n\n312\n00:15:10.978 --> 00:15:12.018\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n313\n00:15:12.018 --> 00:15:12.898\nExactly.\n\n314\n00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:18.080\nWhat can I say here?\n\n315\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.310\nI mean it's common sense\na User ID is publicly available.\n\n316\n00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:25.170\nMy User ID, it's a year at college as\nyou might guess if you went out there,\n\n317\n00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.510\nit would be pretty easy\nto find first of all.\n\n318\n00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.907\n&gt;&gt; A lot of companies use the same naming\nconvention too especially once you\n\n319\n00:15:30.907 --> 00:15:34.137\nstart working in that environment and\nyou see you move from company or\n\n320\n00:15:34.137 --> 00:15:35.598\neven just sending out emails.\n\n321\n00:15:35.598 --> 00:15:36.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You'll notice, yeah.\n\n322\n00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.930\n&gt;&gt; Well, and\ncompany policies relative to email or\n\n323\n00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:44.600\nuser conventions, are pretty much\nstandard across the company.\n\n324\n00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.338\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n325\n00:15:45.338 --> 00:15:49.220\n&gt;&gt; So mine's slinthicum,\nyou've got my user name,\n\n326\n00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.540\nwhat you don't have is my password, okay?\n\n327\n00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.761\nSo you need to carefully guard those.\n\n328\n00:15:57.761 --> 00:15:58.396\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n329\n00:15:58.396 --> 00:16:01.260\n&gt;&gt; I guess is my point in all of this.\n\n330\n00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:07.100\nAnd do not use personal information\nthat can be easily found by others.\n\n331\n00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.250\nThis is me going out to your\nFacebook account and scraping it and\n\n332\n00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.896\ngetting that content.\n\n333\n00:16:10.896 --> 00:16:12.880\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And then creating a dictionary that's\n\n334\n00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.610\nspecially designed for you that I\ncan use to break into your password.\n\n335\n00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.679\n&gt;&gt; I see you've got Fido there, right?\n\n336\n00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:21.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and one of the things that's also\n\n337\n00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.940\nout there is that we're often asked,\nparticularly in a recovery mode, where\n\n338\n00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.230\nwe're trying to recover our password that\nwe can't remember, personal questions.\n\n339\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.340\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; And there are some pretty common ones\n\n340\n00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.670\nthere that I'm always\nreluctant to answer correctly.\n\n341\n00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.030\n&gt;&gt; You know what I saw that\nwas really interesting?\n\n342\n00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.990\nI don't know if you guys have\nheard of Guccifer, I think,\n\n343\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.220\nI don't know if he was Romanian.\n\n344\n00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.660\nHe came from that town, Hackerville and\n\n345\n00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.890\nthat's what kind of sparked the whole\ninvestigation with the Clinton's.\n\n346\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.106\nHe got into the Bush's email accounts.\n\n347\n00:16:51.106 --> 00:16:54.461\nBut it wasn't because he ran any\nkind of sophisticated program,\n\n348\n00:16:54.461 --> 00:16:58.130\nhe was literally guessing\npasswords into these accounts.\n\n349\n00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.690\nAnd something that I thought was\na really cool idea was if I said, Steve,\n\n350\n00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:02.795\nwhat is your favorite color?\n\n351\n00:17:02.795 --> 00:17:07.460\nYou're password could be greenbeans and\n\n352\n00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.170\nit's so\nfar out there that it might just work.\n\n353\n00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.628\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and again,\na lot of password recovery wants,\n\n354\n00:17:14.628 --> 00:17:20.190\nthey're asking you security questions\nabout something you already know.\n\n355\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.680\nAnd the world knows your pet's\nname you have it on Facebook.\n\n356\n00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.250\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's possible for\nme to find that information about you so\n\n357\n00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:29.860\nyou don't ever wanna tie that into some\nform of security into your account.\n\n358\n00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.110\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, exactly.\n\n359\n00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:36.275\nSo they give us some examples again of\nsome passwords and I know that you don't.\n\n360\n00:17:36.275 --> 00:17:37.115\n&gt;&gt; He's changing them.\n\n361\n00:17:37.115 --> 00:17:37.740\nNo, he's doing good.\n\n362\n00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.587\nHere we go.\n\n363\n00:17:38.587 --> 00:17:40.595\n&gt;&gt; Well, he changed them a little bit.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n364\n00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:42.495\n&gt;&gt; And this is, I guess,\n\n365\n00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:43.625\na helpful sort of thing.\n\n366\n00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:46.485\nRemember CLOUDS, relative.\n\n367\n00:17:46.485 --> 00:17:49.295\nThe good thing is with\nclouds that's a good thing.\n\n368\n00:17:49.295 --> 00:17:52.735\nIt's nice to see beautiful skies\nwith clouds in them, I guess.\n\n369\n00:17:52.735 --> 00:17:55.045\nAnd so this term, this pneumonic.\n\n370\n00:17:55.045 --> 00:17:56.150\n&gt;&gt; Pneumonic we have here.\n\n371\n00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.280\n&gt;&gt; You want your passwords to be complex,\n\n372\n00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.750\nlengthy, only yours, unique,\ndifferent and short term.\n\n373\n00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.990\nNow, I'm not sure that you can\nremember that beyond this slide but\n\n374\n00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.790\nyou might think about it.\n\n375\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.520\n&gt;&gt; That's okay.\nI don't think we'll be quizzed on this.\n\n376\n00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.285\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n377\n00:18:10.285 --> 00:18:12.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then not SUN,\n\n378\n00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.000\nsimple, your User ID or your name.\n\n379\n00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.850\nAnd that just makes common sense.\n\n380\n00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:22.125\nSo the whole idea here is\ncomplexity in password.\n\n381\n00:18:22.125 --> 00:18:24.200\nSomeday we're gonna eliminate this.\n\n382\n00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.900\n&gt;&gt; I'm in agreement with you.\n\n383\n00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.770\nI think we're headed in that direction,\nSteve.\n\n384\n00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:32.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've got to move on to\nother things that grant us access and\n\n385\n00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.400\nit may be physical, it may be.\n\n386\n00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.960\n&gt;&gt; Subconscious, who knows?\n\n387\n00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.845\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, I don't know.\n\n388\n00:18:39.845 --> 00:18:41.475\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe my phone.\n\n389\n00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:43.890\n[LAUGH] That's probably a good thing.\n\n390\n00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.090\nSo that's basically it.\n\n391\n00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.000\nNow in final thoughts,\nwhen you go to the site and\n\n392\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.090\nI've talked about it earlier,\nput up items.\n\n393\n00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:55.340\nI have one item up there and\nit's showing you hashing and how it works.\n\n394\n00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.990\nIt's basically a site where you enter\na phrase and then you get its hash value.\n\n395\n00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:01.110\nAnd then you modify it.\n\n396\n00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.460\nIt may be just be having a phrase and\nputting a period on the end.\n\n397\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.510\nAnd then you check the new hash value and\n\n398\n00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.810\nthere is no similarity\nat all between the two.\n\n399\n00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.338\nSo that defines when we're talking about.\n\n400\n00:19:13.338 --> 00:19:17.100\n&gt;&gt; Sending messages and\npurifying the integrity of that message.\n\n401\n00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.390\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, exactly.\n\n402\n00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:23.020\nSo that's pretty much it for this module.\n\n403\n00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:23.660\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you.\n\n404\n00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.905\nI appreciate you coming in and explaining\nall these different techniques that\n\n405\n00:19:26.905 --> 00:19:29.845\nwe can implement and\nmake our passwords more secure.\n\n406\n00:19:29.845 --> 00:19:32.455\nAnd I appreciate you guys for\nhanging in there with us.\n\n407\n00:19:32.455 --> 00:19:36.895\nSo stay tuned, we do have more\nCyberPatriot training coming your way.\n\n408\n00:19:36.895 --> 00:19:40.125\nBut for this particular episode\nI think that about wraps it up.\n\n409\n00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:42.605\nSigning off, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n410\n00:19:42.605 --> 00:19:44.385\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n411\n00:19:44.385 --> 00:19:47.390\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at CyberPatriot.\n\n412\n00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:53.306\n[MUSIC]\n\n413\n00:19:53.306 --> 00:19:56.270\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching IT Pro Tv.\n\n4\n00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.664\n&gt;&gt; Welcome Cyber Patriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:15.664 --> 00:00:18.600\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.160\nAnd this is going to be\nan introduction to unit five zero,\n\n7\n00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.910\nwhich is going to be computer basics and\nvirtualization.\n\n8\n00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.800\nWith us today we have professor\nSteve Linthicum to go ahead and\n\n9\n00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.820\nhelp us with this topic.\n\n10\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.150\nThank you for joining us today Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.980\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nI'm looking forward to this topic.\n\n12\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.490\nThis will be more interesting,\nI think, for a lot of the students.\n\n13\n00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.310\nSo let's go through and hit it.\n\n14\n00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.790\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and look at our objectives.\n\n15\n00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so first we're gonna look at\nthe objectives, they're up right now.\n\n16\n00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.280\nFirst objective is participants\nwill understand the internal\n\n17\n00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.390\ncomponents of a computer.\n\n18\n00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.109\nAnd we're gonna look at basic\ncomputer concepts and terminology,\n\n19\n00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.270\ncommon security issue types.\n\n20\n00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.482\nThe next one is we're gonna look at\nunderstanding operating system purposes,\n\n21\n00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:01.048\ntypes, and security.\n\n22\n00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:04.512\nAnd we'll be looking at the purposes and\nuses of operating systems and\n\n23\n00:01:04.512 --> 00:01:08.230\nthe major operating systems\nthat are currently used today.\n\n24\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.400\nNext, we'll look at understanding\nthe basics of virtualized computing.\n\n25\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.300\nAnd this is a hard concept\nto wrap your brain around.\n\n26\n00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.210\nBut we're going to show you\na virtual environment and\n\n27\n00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.850\nit will make much more sense\nas we go through this section.\n\n28\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.130\nAnd then, finally,\n\n29\n00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.280\nyou'll gain a broad understanding of\nmajor network components and concepts.\n\n30\n00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.690\nAn overview of the basic types and\nconcepts of networks.\n\n31\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.130\nThe terms and the definitions.\n\n32\n00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.530\nAnd we are also gonna take a brief\nlook at the Cisco Networking Academy.\n\n33\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.140\nCisco is a partner in\nthe Cyber Patriot program and\n\n34\n00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.080\nyou are gonna be learning\nabout Cisco products.\n\n35\n00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.520\nAnd there's a lot of tools\nin their network academy.\n\n36\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.685\nYou're gonna get a membership\nin their academy.\n\n37\n00:01:51.685 --> 00:01:53.011\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; And you're gonna get an opportunity,\n\n38\n00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:53.815\nand it's really cool.\n\n39\n00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:55.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's really cool.\n\n40\n00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.960\nYou're gonna get an opportunity to use\ntheir environment for additional learning.\n\n41\n00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.920\nYou're gonna also have an opportunity\nto play around with something called\n\n42\n00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.190\nPacket Tracer.\n\n43\n00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.420\nWhich is an amazing piece of software.\n\n44\n00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.140\nIt's where you can create your own\nnetworks and you can set it up so\n\n45\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.830\nyou're transferring information from\none virtual network device to another.\n\n46\n00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.920\nSo it'll give you a much\nbetter visualization.\n\n47\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.630\nWe're talking about basically electrons,\nand\n\n48\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.150\nas you look at a wire you\ncan't see the electrons.\n\n49\n00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.210\nBecause they're so small and\n\n50\n00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.990\nit's hard to visualize what's\ngoing on with electricity.\n\n51\n00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.540\nAnd so\nthe packet tracer will give you a sense\n\n52\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.850\nof what's actually happening\non a computer network.\n\n53\n00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.730\nSo that's a broad overview\nof the learning objectives.\n\n54\n00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.050\n&gt;&gt; I'm really excited\nabout them having this.\n\n55\n00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.380\nYou guys have access to\nthe Cisco training materials.\n\n56\n00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.570\nAnd I'll tell you why.\n\n57\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.880\nCisco is actually one of the companies\nthat also recognizes the need,\n\n58\n00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.650\nthe security skill set deficit.\n\n59\n00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.750\nAnd they've poured about\n$10 million into training.\n\n60\n00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.310\nAnd I myself have actually signed up for\ntheir cyber-ops scholarship program,\n\n61\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.030\nbecause they see that\npeople do wanna learn.\n\n62\n00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.000\nAnd there's not enough\npositions out there and\n\n63\n00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.480\nthey wanna leverage that\nwith providing training.\n\n64\n00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.700\nSo that's pretty awesome.\n\n65\n00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.440\n&gt;&gt; It's really cool.\n\n66\n00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.580\n&gt;&gt; So stay tuned.\n\n67\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.060\nWe have a lot of training coming your way.\n\n68\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.360\nWe're gonna go ahead and get started.\n\n69\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.170\nI think we'll start out with the physical\ncomponents with our hardware machines.\n\n70\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.010\nSo don't go anywhere,\nwe're gonna go ahead and be here,\n\n71\n00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.850\nbringing this material to you.\n\n72\n00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.972\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nsign off for this brief episode here.\n\n73\n00:03:30.972 --> 00:03:32.584\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n74\n00:03:32.584 --> 00:03:34.484\n&gt;&gt;

Right, so let's go through,\nand I'm gonna bring up a slide.\n\n12\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.060\nAnd this slide shows it's\ncharacterized as Computer Anatomy 101.\n\n13\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.721\nAnd it shows a variety of devices,\nand so we're gonna go through and\n\n14\n00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:44.940\ntalk about these devices.\n\n15\n00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.160\nThat big box in the center\nthat has CPU on it,\n\n16\n00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.920\nthat is basically what we\ncommonly refer to as a computer.\n\n17\n00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.470\nIt contains the parts and\npieces that are internal to that box.\n\n18\n00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.890\nAnd it includes the CPU,\n\n19\n00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.250\nwhich we often characterize as\nthe brains of the computer.\n\n20\n00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.090\nIt is where the processing is going on.\n\n21\n00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.160\nIt does mathematical calculations,\ncreates what we see on the screen.\n\n22\n00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.110\nIt is the central, I guess I'd\ncall it a device in the computer.\n\n23\n00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.078\n&gt;&gt; Hence the name,\ncentral processing unit.\n\n24\n00:01:16.078 --> 00:01:17.761\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, exactly.\n\n25\n00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:19.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And inside that box,\n\n26\n00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.150\nyou also have a couple other\ncomponents that are highlighted here.\n\n27\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.780\nYou have memory,\nwhich is random-access memory.\n\n28\n00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.330\nAnd your whole purpose, relative to that,\nis it's temporary storage.\n\n29\n00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.520\nIt's what we call volatile storage,\nmeaning when the power goes out, whatever\n\n30\n00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.790\ninformation was in that random-access\nmemory is gone, it's vaporized.\n\n31\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.330\nAnd when you turn the power back on,\n\n32\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.430\nthen information is loaded in there that\nthe CPU needs to help process information.\n\n33\n00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.420\nAnd periodically, programming,\nbasically, goes in and\n\n34\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.730\nout and data goes in and out of the RAM.\n\n35\n00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.640\nAs the CPU needs it and\nno longer needs it, it leaves RAM.\n\n36\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.230\nAnd it's substituted with new information.\n\n37\n00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.060\nIf you really wanna improve a computer,\nyou have an older computer, let's say, and\n\n38\n00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.460\nyou want to improve its speed, this is\none place where you can spend some money.\n\n39\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.860\nAnd improve your computer and\nextend its life.\n\n40\n00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.410\nThe challenge with RAM is finding\nout when you should upgrade.\n\n41\n00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.400\nAnd if you wait too long and\nthey quit making that RAM, guess what?\n\n42\n00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.850\nThe price goes up.\n\n43\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.516\nSo, as your computer ages and\nthey're still making that RAM,\n\n44\n00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:34.644\nthe price is going down,\ndown, down, down, down.\n\n45\n00:02:34.644 --> 00:02:35.996\n&gt;&gt; Even on laptops, yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:35.996 --> 00:02:39.085\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's not always super expensive.\n\n47\n00:02:39.085 --> 00:02:41.788\nAnd if you're not really familiar about,\nthere are so\n\n48\n00:02:41.788 --> 00:02:43.740\nmany different types of RAM out there.\n\n49\n00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.525\nAnd we won't, I don't think we'll\nget into all of that here, but.\n\n50\n00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:46.328\n&gt;&gt; No, we won't do that.\n\n51\n00:02:46.328 --> 00:02:48.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can use tools.\n\n52\n00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.670\nOn Crucial's website, they have little\ntools that you can download, and\n\n53\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.240\nit'll tell you.\n\n54\n00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.680\nThey make it really easy.\n\n55\n00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.420\nThey want you to buy their product, right.\n\n56\n00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.850\nYou don't always have to buy it from them.\n\n57\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.492\nYou can go to other vendors and buy it.\n\n58\n00:02:58.492 --> 00:03:03.270\nBut it's a really,\nI would say relatively inexpensive.\n\n59\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.790\nNow if you're talking high end,\nthat's a different story.\n\n60\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.230\nBut it's a relatively inexpensive way to\nsee an immediate return on investment.\n\n61\n00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.230\nYou'll notice those speeds definitely\nkicking into gear there Steve.\n\n62\n00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.427\n&gt;&gt; Well, and the reality is,\nthat your extending the life.\n\n63\n00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:18.584\nBecause eventually you're\ngonna replace the computer.\n\n64\n00:03:18.584 --> 00:03:22.784\nComputers it's not that they,\nwell they could break I guess, but\n\n65\n00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:25.740\nchances are they probably won't break.\n\n66\n00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.270\nIt would just get to a point\nwhere you can't effectively\n\n67\n00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.560\nrun the software of today on it.\n\n68\n00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, because the software's requiring\nmore processing power, more RAM.\n\n69\n00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.774\nBecause we want more graphics, we want\nbetter color rendering, 3D effects,\n\n70\n00:03:40.774 --> 00:03:44.405\nthings like that, and our systems,\nthey kind of get outdated.\n\n71\n00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:45.175\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's the truth.\n\n72\n00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:45.749\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n73\n00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:46.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n74\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.960\n&gt;&gt; The next item over here that they\ntalk about as hardware is storage.\n\n75\n00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.330\nAnd typically inside a computer,\n\n76\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.670\ninside that box where the CPU is located,\nyou'll have hard drives.\n\n77\n00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.240\nWe have two basic types of hard drives.\n\n78\n00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.284\nWe have ones that are what\nwe call spinning,\n\n79\n00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.566\nmeaning they have mechanical\ncomponents in it.\n\n80\n00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:09.079\nAnd actually there's platters that are\nspinning around, and around, and around.\n\n81\n00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.840\nAnd eventually hard drives\nlike this will fail.\n\n82\n00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.228\nThey'll fail because they're\na mechanical device.\n\n83\n00:04:16.228 --> 00:04:20.436\nAnd so we have in a more recent computers,\n\n84\n00:04:20.436 --> 00:04:27.420\nwe're using solid memory I guess is\nthe way I would characterize it.\n\n85\n00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.840\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; It actually looks like\n\n86\n00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.475\nmemory sticks if you take the casing\noff of these solid state drives.\n\n87\n00:04:32.475 --> 00:04:34.020\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they're using that solid\n\n88\n00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.500\nstate memory.\n\n89\n00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.960\nAnd the good news is,\nyou don't have parts that wear out,\n\n90\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.240\nalthough the constant movement\nof information on and\n\n91\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.360\noff will eventually cause these solid\nstate drives to fail, potentially.\n\n92\n00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.050\nI'm telling you this because I think we\nhad a discussion on an earlier video about\n\n93\n00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.150\nbacking up.\n\n94\n00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.160\nSo expect stuff that's on, and I say\nstuff, information that's on these drives.\n\n95\n00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.850\nExpect that they will fail, and\n\n96\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.360\nwith their failure you could\npotentially lose this information.\n\n97\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.200\nSo again, that's a reason for backing up.\n\n98\n00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.370\nNow inside of this box today, or inside\nof this laptop that's in front of me.\n\n99\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.410\nThere isn't an awful lot\nthat you can do today.\n\n100\n00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.810\nBack, in the 80s it was,\nyou'd always build your own computers.\n\n101\n00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.580\nAnd you could do all kinds of-\n&gt;&gt; Well not even that long ago.\n\n102\n00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.961\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n103\n00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:26.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm\n\n104\n00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.760\ntrying to think of when I\nbuilt my last computer.\n\n105\n00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.680\nAnd truthfully it's been quite some time\nago because it's just cheaper to buy one.\n\n106\n00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.830\nNumber one probably, there isn't\nthat return on investment saving\n\n107\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.710\nyourself money by building your own.\n\n108\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.340\nAlthough if you're gamer, probably make\nsome sense maybe to build your own\n\n109\n00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.050\ncomputer because you can put the sort of\ngraphic card in there that you want and\n\n110\n00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.450\nother components.\n\n111\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.210\n&gt;&gt; For me it was appealing because I\nmight not have had the full money.\n\n112\n00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.140\nAnd if I wanted to upgrade later down\nthe road, I still had that option.\n\n113\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.714\nI didn't have all the money up front and\nthen I can go ahead and\n\n114\n00:06:02.714 --> 00:06:04.645\nswitch parts out later on down the road,\nso.\n\n115\n00:06:04.645 --> 00:06:07.493\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know.\n\n116\n00:06:07.493 --> 00:06:11.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It isn't as much fun today in my mind,\n\n117\n00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.400\nbecause there isn't as\nmuch that you have to do.\n\n118\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.120\nWay back in the early days of computing\nyou had to deal with IRQs and\n\n119\n00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.910\nIO addressing in a variety of settings,\nwhere you have to go through and\n\n120\n00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.540\nmove these little dip switches.\n\n121\n00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.850\nAnd it was a challenge,\nit was a challenge putting them together.\n\n122\n00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.360\nBut not so much today.\n\n123\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.790\nAbout the only thing that I do with\ncomputers is put in additional RAM, for\n\n124\n00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.520\nexample, or a new hard drive.\n\n125\n00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.090\nThose sorts of activities.\n\n126\n00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.640\nNow the other devices that are shown here,\nwe have input devices, and\n\n127\n00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.360\nwe have output devices.\n\n128\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.240\nAnd we can also have devices that\ncould be both, input and output.\n\n129\n00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.750\nSo input devices, standard ones\nare your keyboard, perhaps a camera.\n\n130\n00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.780\nPerhaps like a mouse.\n\n131\n00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.883\n&gt;&gt; Anything that's sending\ndata into the system.\n\n132\n00:06:54.883 --> 00:06:57.417\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Hence the name input device.\n\n133\n00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.853\n&gt;&gt; And\noutput devices would be your screen,\n\n134\n00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:02.573\nalthough it may be both an output and\nan input.\n\n135\n00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:04.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if it's a touchscreen.\n\n136\n00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if it's a touchscreen.\n\n137\n00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:11.030\nSpeakers, perhaps printers,\nand then this is all hardware.\n\n138\n00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.070\nAnd hardware is fine, but\nit doesn't work unless you have software.\n\n139\n00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.010\nAnd we're gonna talk about software in a\nlater section when we talk about operating\n\n140\n00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.985\nsystems, because that's your\nprimary piece of software.\n\n141\n00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:27.122\nThat is getting the hardware\nto do something.\n\n142\n00:07:27.122 --> 00:07:27.704\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n143\n00:07:27.704 --> 00:07:30.105\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; One thing that I don't see on here that\n\n144\n00:07:30.105 --> 00:07:33.456\nI think is definitely worth\nmentioning would be a motherboard,\n\n145\n00:07:33.456 --> 00:07:37.551\nbecause all of these components are gonna\nbe plugging into the motherboard and\n\n146\n00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:40.120\nwe also have a power supply\nthat supplies power.\n\n147\n00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.142\nWe've got our AC power that\ncomes from our wall and\n\n148\n00:07:44.142 --> 00:07:47.322\nthen our components that you're looking\nat there, they're actually using DC,\n\n149\n00:07:47.322 --> 00:07:52.000\ndirect current so we need an inverter\nto go ahead and facilitate that for us.\n\n150\n00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.030\nAnd another thing you mentioned Steve\nwas you were using this term box for\n\n151\n00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.770\nthe actual computer, which is very common.\n\n152\n00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.080\nPeople even say a black box\nif it's a generic brand.\n\n153\n00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.497\nAnd maybe you have built your own computer\nand it's not a Dell, a name brand, or\n\n154\n00:08:05.497 --> 00:08:06.422\nanything like that.\n\n155\n00:08:06.422 --> 00:08:10.806\nAnd some other terms you might hear\npeople say would be machine, chassis,\n\n156\n00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:14.600\nthe case, so\nthat's what they're referring to there.\n\n157\n00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.970\nAnd you're right, we don't have to\ndo as much manually these days.\n\n158\n00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.310\nThey really make these components easy for\nus.\n\n159\n00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.030\nA lot of the components are keyed or\n\n160\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.350\nnotched in a way that they only fit\ninto the slot in one orientation.\n\n161\n00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.420\nSo a word of advice here.\n\n162\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.280\nIf you're shoving and you're really\nexerting a lot of force trying to put\n\n163\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.010\nsomething, stop, because there's\nprobably a reason why it's not fitting.\n\n164\n00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:40.210\nSo make sure the connectors\nare actually oriented the right way, or\n\n165\n00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.250\nthat they are in fact the same\ntype of connectors, so.\n\n166\n00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.980\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I remember those days,\n\n167\n00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.220\nwhere you could put it in\nbackwards quite easily.\n\n168\n00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.268\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so now they try to prevent\nsome of those problems from happening.\n\n169\n00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:51.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n170\n00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.260\nOkay so let's go on to the next.\n\n171\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.380\nWe're gonna go briefly\nthrough all this stuff.\n\n172\n00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.820\nThe basic input-output system,\n\n173\n00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.650\nthis is actually typically\na chip on a mother board.\n\n174\n00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.710\nAnd it contains information.\n\n175\n00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:08.990\nIt's much the same as RAM, but it's ROM,\nmeaning that when you cut the power,\n\n176\n00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.820\nthat information still stays there.\n\n177\n00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.830\nAnd this is where you would set up\n\n178\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.440\nthe devices that should\nbe expected to be there.\n\n179\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.050\nFor example, hard drives.\n\n180\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.600\nYou'd set the time of\nthe machine initially.\n\n181\n00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.140\nA whole bunch of settings\nyou would have here.\n\n182\n00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.487\nSo they're basic settings, so\nwhen the machine first fires off,\n\n183\n00:09:26.487 --> 00:09:29.297\nbefore it really reaches out\nto the operating system and\n\n184\n00:09:29.297 --> 00:09:31.838\nstarts inputting information\ninto the process.\n\n185\n00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:33.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah this one's a weird one.\n\n186\n00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.590\nIt's kind of in-between.\n\n187\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.380\nYou showed us hardware.\n\n188\n00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.817\nAnd you also introduced us to software,\n\n189\n00:09:38.817 --> 00:09:43.580\nand you'll hear BIOS being called\nfirmware, so it kind of lies in-between.\n\n190\n00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.990\nIt is that ROM, that read-only memory and\nwe saw before you talked about RAM,\n\n191\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.540\nthe random-access memory.\n\n192\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.070\nSo it's kind of different in the way\nthat it's not dependent on software,\n\n193\n00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.080\nthe operating system.\n\n194\n00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.350\nYou can actually access your BIOS without\nhaving any operating system installed.\n\n195\n00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.130\nAnd like Steve said, you can go in and\nchange those settings,\n\n196\n00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:08.555\nCPU, our clock cycles, you could\npassword protect it if you wanted to.\n\n197\n00:10:08.555 --> 00:10:10.210\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So there's a lot with that.\n\n198\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.632\nThe only thing is that BIOS has\nbeen around for a long time.\n\n199\n00:10:13.632 --> 00:10:15.695\nI think over 25 years, so\n\n200\n00:10:15.695 --> 00:10:20.000\nyou guys might see something out\nthere called UEFI which stands for\n\n201\n00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.100\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface and\nit's kind of likea face lift to BIOS.\n\n202\n00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.340\nThe interface is a little\nmore user friendly.\n\n203\n00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.120\nYou can use the mouse with UEFI.\n\n204\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.620\nThere are other improvements as well, but\nthat's probably gonna be notably the most\n\n205\n00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.350\nnoticeable because with BIOS,\nit's gonna be menu driven interface.\n\n206\n00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.980\nSo you can't use a mouse.\n\n207\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.020\nYou'll be using your arrow keys.\n\n208\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.510\nAnd the way that you\nactually enter it would be\n\n209\n00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.490\nby hitting depending on your motherboard.\n\n210\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.940\nYou could hit F8, or\na series of function keys.\n\n211\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.500\nOr even escape and delete sometimes.\n\n212\n00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.410\nYou would just need to check\nthe documentation for that motherboard.\n\n213\n00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.610\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n214\n00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.760\nSo let's go on to the next slide.\n\n215\n00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.302\nThese are common hardware/BIOS\nvulnerabilities, backdoors,\n\n216\n00:11:05.302 --> 00:11:09.559\nperhaps the manufacturer of the BIOS,\nthe person that created it,\n\n217\n00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:14.263\nor the entity that created it might\nhave left things open that allow you to,\n\n218\n00:11:14.263 --> 00:11:17.990\na hacker and to go in and\nmake some modifications.\n\n219\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.730\nWe've got environmental concerns.\n\n220\n00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.910\nAll hardware is susceptible to flood,\nfire, just about anything.\n\n221\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:29.470\nSo amazingly sometimes you'll leave,\nwe saw that\n\n222\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.410\nfirst case that's a tower case, it's on\nthe floor, it's sucking up dust and dirt.\n\n223\n00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.230\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n224\n00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.780\n&gt;&gt; That can be problematic because it\ncan cause the processor to overheat, for\n\n225\n00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.530\nexample.\n\n226\n00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\njust kind of blanketing that dust around.\n\n227\n00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.850\nThey can get really, really bad too.\n\n228\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.560\nSo it's just part of normal maintenance,\n\n229\n00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.705\nlike you would change the oil on your car,\nwell can clean your case out.\n\n230\n00:11:50.705 --> 00:11:53.525\nIf you put them on the floor, though,\nthey do tend to accumulate a lot more.\n\n231\n00:11:53.525 --> 00:11:56.355\nBut we see also, and\nyou mentioned tower style.\n\n232\n00:11:56.355 --> 00:12:00.235\nBut we have a lot of different style of\nthose cases also, you have slim lines.\n\n233\n00:12:00.235 --> 00:12:05.193\nI don't really see too many of the clam,\nthat was a little older there,\n\n234\n00:12:05.193 --> 00:12:07.205\nbut all in ones, so.\n\n235\n00:12:07.205 --> 00:12:12.470\n&gt;&gt; Yep, the BIOS can be attacked through\nmalware, that can cause the BIOS to crash.\n\n236\n00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:13.624\nThat's a concern out there.\n\n237\n00:12:13.624 --> 00:12:20.210\nAnd also in RAM,\nsometimes malware can be installed on RAM.\n\n238\n00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.950\nFortunately when you cut the power\nto the RAM it disappears, but\n\n239\n00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:29.110\nthen in an hour, it can be created\nin a fashion where every time you\n\n240\n00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.240\nfire off your machine,\nit goes back into RAM.\n\n241\n00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.880\nSo, you gotta be-\n&gt;&gt; One thing that's interesting,\n\n242\n00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.058\nthey don't note here,\nis your CMOS battery,\n\n243\n00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:43.946\nwhich basically historically,\nit would retain those BIOS settings,\n\n244\n00:12:43.946 --> 00:12:48.353\nthe system settings there whenever\nwe didn't have that power.\n\n245\n00:12:48.353 --> 00:12:50.520\nAnd you could password protect the BIOS.\n\n246\n00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.880\nBut one way that an attacker could get\naround that was to physically pop that\n\n247\n00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.150\nbattery out, let the charge dissipate,\nand then it didn't have a password.\n\n248\n00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:04.440\nBut now we see a different\nstyle of ROM being used\n\n249\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.000\nas chips that are actually\non the motherboard.\n\n250\n00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.212\nSo your CMOS battery really just\nholds that time and date setting,\n\n251\n00:13:11.212 --> 00:13:16.250\nsupplies a little trickle there so you\ndon't have to reset your clock every time\n\n252\n00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:21.079\nyou log on, but that would be one way\nto physically bypass that protection.\n\n253\n00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:23.040\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n254\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.250\n&gt;&gt; I think as far as hardware goes,\nwe've talked about hardware,\n\n255\n00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.670\nwe've talked about firmware.\n\n256\n00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.990\nLet's go ahead and stop here and\n\n257\n00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.060\nin the next episode we'll\nintroduce you to software.\n\n258\n00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:33.686\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n259\n00:13:33.686 --> 00:13:36.200\n&gt;&gt; So yeah we'll go ahead and\nwrap up here.\n\n260\n00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.870\nBut stay tuned, we're gonna go ahead and\njump into some software coming up next.\n\n261\n00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:44.500\nSo for this particular episode we'll be\nsigning out as your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n262\n00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.074\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n263\n00:13:46.074 --> 00:13:48.932\n&gt;&gt; See you next time for CyberPatriot.\n\n264\n00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:55.364\n[MUSIC]\n\n265\n00:13:55.364 --> 00:13:58.419\nThank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

All right, so let's get started.\n\n14\n00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.360\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and\ntake a look at our slides here.\n\n15\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna bring up the slides.\n\n16\n00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.470\nOkay, what we're looking\nat here on this slide is\n\n17\n00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.120\nthe three standard sort of operating\nsystems today you're likely to encounter.\n\n18\n00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.350\nYou can see that we have Windows.\n\n19\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.090\nWe have Ubuntu, which is a brand of Linux.\n\n20\n00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.760\nAnd we also have the Apple product that's\nOSX, sometimes referred to as OS 10.\n\n21\n00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.220\nAnd these are three good\nexamples of operating systems\n\n22\n00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.870\nthat you're really likely to see.\n\n23\n00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.020\nSo what we're gonna do is go through and\ntalk about each of these.\n\n24\n00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.650\nAs I mentioned in the previous slide,\n\n25\n00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.720\nthis is the key component that has\nyour hardware being able to do things.\n\n26\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.040\nI guess that would be\nthe best way to describe it.\n\n27\n00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.160\nAnd things that you do as you run\napplications, you print, you save files.\n\n28\n00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.140\nYou do all kinds of things\ninside of an operating system.\n\n29\n00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.066\nAnd we're gonna spend a lot of time\ninside of a couple of operating systems\n\n30\n00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.580\nthat are focus of Cyber Patriot.\n\n31\n00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.210\nThat is Windows and Ubuntu,\nwhich is a variation of Linux.\n\n32\n00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.840\nLinux is a open source based product,\nmeaning you don't have to pay for it.\n\n33\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.240\nBut meaning that it can be\nsomewhat challenging and\n\n34\n00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.950\nthat you probably have to\nknow it a little bit more.\n\n35\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.760\nAnd you're gonna see a variety of flavors,\nmeaning some\n\n36\n00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.640\ntypes of Linux are better at some\nthings and not so good in other ways.\n\n37\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.350\nWe have different brands of Linux that are\nactually kind of a Windows replacement.\n\n38\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.800\nThe neat thing about Linux is that\nit doesn't seem to get attacked as\n\n39\n00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.230\nmuch by hackers.\n\n40\n00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.640\nAnd so that's one reason why\nyou might wanna run Linux.\n\n41\n00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.620\nAnd it will run on a wide variety of,\nor how can I describe it?\n\n42\n00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.012\nA less powerful hardware?\n\n43\n00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:26.185\n&gt;&gt; So here's the thing.\n\n44\n00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:31.860\nAnd when you mentioned, you brought\nup a good point about the software.\n\n45\n00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.450\nBecause the way I think of it is, you\ncan have really great hardware, but your\n\n46\n00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.860\nhardware is only going to be performing as\nwell as the intelligence, the software.\n\n47\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.169\nAnd you mentioned different\nversions of Linux.\n\n48\n00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.970\nSo bringing it back a little bit, I don't\nknow if you guys are familiar with this\n\n49\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.340\nterm open source versus closed source.\n\n50\n00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.905\nMicrosoft, Mac OS X,\nthose are gonna be closed source,\n\n51\n00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:55.240\nmeaning we have to pay for them.\n\n52\n00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.430\nLinux is an open source code, so\nthe reason you see so many flavors and\n\n53\n00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.440\nvariations out there is because people\ntake that source code and modify it.\n\n54\n00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.380\nSo not everyone is as skilled.\n\n55\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.900\nSo that's why you have those varying\nlevels, like Steve mentioned.\n\n56\n00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.640\nAnd also, the other concept like\nhe was saying is you see Windows,\n\n57\n00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.600\nthat's with a graphically user interface,\na GUI.\n\n58\n00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.320\nPredominantly, Linux historically has\nbeen driven by a command line interface.\n\n59\n00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.850\nThey're the use terminal.\n\n60\n00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.596\nBut that's not the case anymore is it,\nSteve?\n\n61\n00:03:29.596 --> 00:03:30.144\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n62\n00:03:30.144 --> 00:03:31.480\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n\n63\n00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.045\nAs a matter of fact, we're seeing more and\n\n64\n00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:36.908\nmore the utilization of\nproducts like Ubuntu.\n\n65\n00:03:36.908 --> 00:03:40.801\nAnd that's what you're gonna being\nplaying with inside of a cyber patriot\n\n66\n00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:41.620\nenvironment.\n\n67\n00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.215\nThat's one of the operating systems that\nyou'll be having to face relative to\n\n68\n00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:46.094\nthe competition.\n\n69\n00:03:46.094 --> 00:03:49.360\n&gt;&gt; So this is definitely one we need\nto get to know and familiar with.\n\n70\n00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.640\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n71\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.809\nSo let's move on.\n\n72\n00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.520\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n73\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.660\n&gt;&gt; And on this next slide, what we're\ngonna be talking about is the Windows\n\n74\n00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.520\noperating system, as I mentioned,\nLinux and their variations.\n\n75\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.086\nBut again, for\npurposes of this particular episode, and\n\n76\n00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:11.126\nthis particular series of episodes the one\nwe're gonna be focusing on is Ubuntu.\n\n77\n00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:16.313\nYou can see up on the slide they talk\nabout Debian, and Mint, and Fedora.\n\n78\n00:04:16.313 --> 00:04:19.523\nAnd there is a whole host\nof other variations, but\n\n79\n00:04:19.523 --> 00:04:23.170\nlet's just focus on Ubuntu for\nthe purpose of this.\n\n80\n00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.904\nAnd then Mac.\n\n81\n00:04:23.904 --> 00:04:28.530\nMac is, it's interesting you mentioned\nthat you pay for the Mac operating system.\n\n82\n00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.670\nReally, you don't,\nyou pay for the hardware.\n\n83\n00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.740\n&gt;&gt; Which comes with the-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n84\n00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.975\nthen you get the operating system for\nfree.\n\n85\n00:04:33.975 --> 00:04:39.290\nAnd Apple won't allow you\nto operate OS X 10 on\n\n86\n00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.170\nany other hardware than Mac hardware.\n\n87\n00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.950\nEven though you probably could in the\nvirtual environment perhaps run OS X 10.\n\n88\n00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.690\nYou would be breaking the law.\n\n89\n00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.218\nAnd we're not about breaking the law.\n\n90\n00:04:50.218 --> 00:04:54.620\nWe had that discussion a number of\nepisodes ago relative to ethics.\n\n91\n00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.860\nSo those are the three operating systems.\n\n92\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.460\nAnd let's move on to the next slide.\n\n93\n00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.540\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And talk about some common issues\n\n94\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.810\nrelative to operating systems.\n\n95\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.630\nFirst one listed up here is passwords.\n\n96\n00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.575\nAnd we've already had a heavy\ndiscussion on passwords.\n\n97\n00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:13.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But let's face it,\n\n98\n00:05:13.658 --> 00:05:16.260\nit's important that you\nhave a complex password,\n\n99\n00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.410\nbecause people can break\ninto your machine.\n\n100\n00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.780\nFile access,\nI'm gonna be dating myself, and\n\n101\n00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.760\nyou're gonna see it in a few minutes\nrelative to a couple operating systems.\n\n102\n00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.310\nBut way back when,\nnobody worried about whether or\n\n103\n00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.330\nnot the files on your machine were safe or\nnot.\n\n104\n00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.591\nThey were kept safe because you locked\nyour machine in a drawer in your office,\n\n105\n00:05:39.591 --> 00:05:40.762\nif you could do that.\n\n106\n00:05:40.762 --> 00:05:43.347\nOr you locked your office cuz\nthe machines were so big.\n\n107\n00:05:43.347 --> 00:05:45.334\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the bottom line is in earlier\n\n108\n00:05:45.334 --> 00:05:50.095\noperating systems, we did not have file\npermissions or folder permissions.\n\n109\n00:05:50.095 --> 00:05:55.050\nSo if you logged onto, for\nexample, a Windows 95 machine,\n\n110\n00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:02.219\nwhich is an operating system that came out\nin I think it was 1994, not actually 95.\n\n111\n00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:07.144\nBut that gives you some sense as to how\nMicrosoft used to label their operating\n\n112\n00:06:07.144 --> 00:06:07.840\nsystems.\n\n113\n00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.952\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That didn't have the file and\n\n114\n00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:11.820\nfolder permissions.\n\n115\n00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.100\nAnd so if somebody could\nget ahold of your machine,\n\n116\n00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.490\nthey could view any file on your machine.\n\n117\n00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.680\nAnd that's not the case\nmodernly because we understand\n\n118\n00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.590\nin this interconnected environment,\nmeaning that your machine\n\n119\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.170\nthat's sitting in your office cannot\njust be accessed in your office.\n\n120\n00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.770\nSomebody from the outside through\nthe computer network that existed at your\n\n121\n00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.910\ncompany could actually access\nyour folders, your files, and\n\n122\n00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.320\nso we needed some sort of\nprotection relative to them.\n\n123\n00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.310\nSo that's file access.\n\n124\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.580\nThe next item up here is something\ncalled a blue screen of death.\n\n125\n00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.250\nThis is something that a hacker,\nfor example,\n\n126\n00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.411\nthrough the installation of some\nmalware could cause your machine to do.\n\n127\n00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:54.439\nYou get this big blue screen up and\n\n128\n00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:59.530\nit provides you with a lot of information\nthat probably wasn't too useful for you.\n\n129\n00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.830\nBottom line is you'd have to restart\nthe machine to get it up and running.\n\n130\n00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.670\nAnd then they mention down here,\nunpatched systems.\n\n131\n00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:14.450\nThis idea of patching is relatively new in\na security environment that we have today.\n\n132\n00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.940\nWay back when, when your office\ncomputer was in your office, and\n\n133\n00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.400\nnobody could access it unless\nthey were in your office,\n\n134\n00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.560\nwe didn't have to deal with security\nvulnerabilities like we do today.\n\n135\n00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.270\nBut again, because your computer and\n\n136\n00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.170\nyour thermostat on your wall and\nall of these other devices are connected,\n\n137\n00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:37.270\ninterconnected through the Internet,\nwe have to worry about security.\n\n138\n00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.650\nAnd when software is issued,\nwhen it's released,\n\n139\n00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.450\nit's often times still vulnerable,\nit's likely still vulnerable.\n\n140\n00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.271\nAnd so periodically patches by\nthe software manufacturer are issued, and\n\n141\n00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:51.463\nthey need to be installed on your machine.\n\n142\n00:07:51.463 --> 00:07:55.755\nAnd you need to make sure that they\nare installed, because they're correcting\n\n143\n00:07:55.755 --> 00:07:59.560\na vulnerability, and\nit's really important that you do that.\n\n144\n00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nbecause we've talked about software,\n\n145\n00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.010\nlet's just take a look at that for\na few moments here.\n\n146\n00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.629\nWhen you mention things, well,\nwe won't go too much into passwords.\n\n147\n00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:11.330\nBecause like you said,\nwe covered that already.\n\n148\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.890\nBut file access, when we talk about\npermissions in a Windows operating system,\n\n149\n00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.650\nit’s not exactly the same\nin a Linux environment.\n\n150\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.030\nThe way that you actually implement those\npermissions are gonna be different.\n\n151\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.670\nSo if you're gonna be working,\nwhich you guys will be with different\n\n152\n00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.540\noperating systems, it’s pretty\nimportant to familiarize yourself with\n\n153\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.340\nhow to configure both of\nthose permission settings.\n\n154\n00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.780\nAnd then for the stop error that we\nsee here, our blue screen of death,\n\n155\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.480\nI noticed that the Window operating\nsystems have gotten better with these.\n\n156\n00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.460\nWe don't see as many stop errors, and\n\n157\n00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:47.290\nessentially what that computer is\ndoing is self protecting I guess.\n\n158\n00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.960\nAnd it's stopping itself before\nany further damage could incur.\n\n159\n00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.100\nYou see operating systems like Ubuntu, and\ndifferent Linux flavors, and Mac OS X.\n\n160\n00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.410\nPeople will say those operating\nsystems are more stable, and\n\n161\n00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.520\nthat's what they're referencing.\n\n162\n00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.495\nThere's less stop errors and\n\n163\n00:09:03.495 --> 00:09:09.280\nless overall system problems than with\na Windows operating system there.\n\n164\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.830\nAnd then like you mentioned\nwith your unpatched systems,\n\n165\n00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.180\nit is a big vulnerability now.\n\n166\n00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.316\nWe're not using computers just\nin an office base anymore.\n\n167\n00:09:16.316 --> 00:09:19.563\nThey're connected to the Internet\nall the time it seems like.\n\n168\n00:09:19.563 --> 00:09:23.609\nSo again,\nWindows makes it a little easier for\n\n169\n00:09:23.609 --> 00:09:27.361\nus to go ahead and\npull those updates down.\n\n170\n00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:31.590\nBut we talked about\nthe different Linux flavors.\n\n171\n00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.700\nYou might have to go out to\ndifferent repositories depending on,\n\n172\n00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.310\nit just depends on how well\nthose sites are managed.\n\n173\n00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.850\nA lot of them are really managed well for\nyou to go ahead and get those updates, but\n\n174\n00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.880\nit just depends on what\nversion you're running there.\n\n175\n00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n176\n00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.850\nSo let's go on to the next slide.\n\n177\n00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.350\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n178\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:53.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what we're looking at here is,\nwe talked about operating systems.\n\n179\n00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.350\nAnd with, for example, Windows,\n\n180\n00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.930\nyou have a number of applications\nthat are really housed in Windows.\n\n181\n00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.240\nIf you wanted to do word processing,\nfor example,\n\n182\n00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.640\nyou could use a product called Wordpad.\n\n183\n00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.570\nBut it doesn't have\na lot of fancy features.\n\n184\n00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.030\n&gt;&gt; Rich text formatting or\nany kind of, yeah.\n\n185\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the cool things that\nyou can do with Microsoft Word.\n\n186\n00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.200\n&gt;&gt; Different fonts and things like that.\n\n187\n00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.903\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what happens is that\nyou load onto your operating system\n\n188\n00:10:17.903 --> 00:10:22.014\na variety of applications that\nmeet needs that you have.\n\n189\n00:10:22.014 --> 00:10:27.306\nAnd up here they show basically the\ndiagrams, or I guess it's the Apple apps.\n\n190\n00:10:27.306 --> 00:10:29.970\n&gt;&gt; The icons for, this looks like\nan Office Suite, a package there.\n\n191\n00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've got Excel there,\nyou've got PowerPoint, you have Word.\n\n192\n00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.740\nThose sorts of applications,\nthose are Microsoft applications.\n\n193\n00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.990\nBut there are a lot of computer\napplications out there that are produced\n\n194\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.420\nby other manufacturers.\n\n195\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.210\nSo you install the applications\nonto your computer.\n\n196\n00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.911\nYou're actually installing them\ninto the operating system and\n\n197\n00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:55.171\nthey provide you with a capability of\ndoing a wide variety of activities.\n\n198\n00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:59.703\nAnd their designed for\nspecific things that you want to do.\n\n199\n00:10:59.703 --> 00:11:02.759\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthis term application is a little more,\n\n200\n00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:06.325\nit's used a little loosely than\nwhen I first started in IT.\n\n201\n00:11:06.325 --> 00:11:12.390\nWe would always call these Microsoft Word,\nExcel, PowerPoint programs.\n\n202\n00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.720\nAnd we start seeing a bit of\na change in terminology here, so\n\n203\n00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.742\njust be aware of that also.\n\n204\n00:11:17.742 --> 00:11:18.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, and we see it in the industry,\n\n205\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.490\nbecause we don't call\nprogrammers programmers anymore.\n\n206\n00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.050\nWe call them application developers.\n\n207\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.891\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nit's kind of had a shift there.\n\n208\n00:11:26.891 --> 00:11:30.681\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so let's go on to next one.\n\n209\n00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:31.678\n&gt;&gt; All righty.\n\n210\n00:11:31.678 --> 00:11:33.624\n&gt;&gt; I think we're through this pretty much.\n\n211\n00:11:33.624 --> 00:11:35.154\n&gt;&gt; Virtual machines.\n\n212\n00:11:35.154 --> 00:11:35.660\n&gt;&gt; Oops, virtual machines.\n\n213\n00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.105\n&gt;&gt; That about wraps it up, so good.\n\n214\n00:11:37.105 --> 00:11:38.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, before we wrap it up,\n\n215\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.480\nI wanna show a couple of\nexamples of virtual machines.\n\n216\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.800\nBecause I'm gonna go away\nfrom this particular product,\n\n217\n00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.990\nbecause you're gonna be\nusing a VMware product.\n\n218\n00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.870\nIt's VMware player when\nyou're actually competing.\n\n219\n00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:57.560\nSo if we can go to my desktop,\nthis is a virtual box.\n\n220\n00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.770\nThis is Oracle owns this product,\nand it's free.\n\n221\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.740\nIt's free just like VMware player product.\n\n222\n00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.510\nNow VMware has other products\nthat you have to pay for,\n\n223\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.750\nand they're richer in what they can do.\n\n224\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.128\nThis is-\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft has an option for Hyper-V.\n\n225\n00:12:13.128 --> 00:12:15.470\nThat's their virtualization hypervisor.\n\n226\n00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.030\n&gt;&gt; Right, so there are these\ncompeting products out there.\n\n227\n00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.160\nI really like Virtual Box.\n\n228\n00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.350\nI like it because it has\na lot of the rich features\n\n229\n00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:28.230\nthat VMware has in its work station\nproduct, the one that you pay for.\n\n230\n00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.366\nOr in its Mac product,\nwhich is called Fusion.\n\n231\n00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:35.042\nAnd the reason I'm bringing this slide up\nis because it provides you with a little\n\n232\n00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:39.670\nbit of history that we're gonna\ngo through, but it's not shown.\n\n233\n00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.600\nAnd what we have here is I brought up DOS.\n\n234\n00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.962\nI remember in the early 80s,\nthis was the operating system that I used.\n\n235\n00:12:47.962 --> 00:12:51.355\nThis was Microsoft DOS,\nit was their first operating system.\n\n236\n00:12:51.355 --> 00:12:55.005\nIt is, and there was a reference\nearlier to command line,\n\n237\n00:12:55.005 --> 00:12:57.620\nthis is a true command line environment.\n\n238\n00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:03.036\nIf I want to do a dir, which is to\ngive me an indication of the files and\n\n239\n00:13:03.036 --> 00:13:06.562\nfolders that exist, that's the command.\n\n240\n00:13:06.562 --> 00:13:08.191\nYou type in dir.\n\n241\n00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:12.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so dir for directory, and\nessentially your directories and folders,\n\n242\n00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:17.500\nthat structure within your operating\nsystem is what you're looking at here.\n\n243\n00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.720\n&gt;&gt; And if I wanted to create a document,\nso I would type in E-D-I-T,\n\n244\n00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.750\nand I would call it,\nI don't know, document.\n\n245\n00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.560\nAnd it brings up the editor.\n\n246\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.330\nAnd so I would type here, and\nI even type a bunch of stuff.\n\n247\n00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.010\nBut the bottom line is it's\nnot rich in what you can do.\n\n248\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.960\nIt is simply ASCII text coming up.\n\n249\n00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.320\nAnd I could save it.\n\n250\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.730\nThis is the way, when we first started\nwith computers, this is what we did.\n\n251\n00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.680\nAnd it was a bit challenging,\nthey didn't do or\n\n252\n00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.720\nhave the capabilities that they have.\n\n253\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.414\nMicrosoft-\n&gt;&gt; Not only user-centric like we see today\n\n254\n00:13:55.414 --> 00:13:59.621\nwith all of our really pretty\ninterfaces for our end users, right?\n\n255\n00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:04.780\n&gt;&gt; Well, right now I'm trying to move my\ntouchpad, and I'm not doing very well,\n\n256\n00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:10.410\nbecause this operating system,\nwhen it came out, we didn't have mice.\n\n257\n00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.790\nAnd so everything was with key strokes.\n\n258\n00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.380\nAnd so what I have to do in a virtual\nenvironment is I have to get out of\n\n259\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.130\nthis box.\n\n260\n00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.077\nThis is actually a window.\n\n261\n00:14:17.077 --> 00:14:19.647\nAnd the way you do it is I\nhit the CTRL button, and\n\n262\n00:14:19.647 --> 00:14:22.200\nyou can see that now I can move my mouse.\n\n263\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.166\nAnd I'm gonna go over here real quickly,\nand this is Windows One.\n\n264\n00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:30.339\nWindows One,\nit really ran in that DOS environment.\n\n265\n00:14:30.339 --> 00:14:31.334\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n266\n00:14:31.334 --> 00:14:32.022\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n267\n00:14:32.022 --> 00:14:36.632\nit provided us with the capabilities\nof doing a bunch of things.\n\n268\n00:14:36.632 --> 00:14:43.320\nAs we look around here, we have choices\nof applications that we could use.\n\n269\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:50.130\nThis is actually a common application\nthat exists today on Windows.\n\n270\n00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:56.190\nThis is Notepad, this is what we\nthink as the original text editor.\n\n271\n00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.245\nIt provided us with more capabilities.\n\n272\n00:14:58.245 --> 00:15:02.810\nWhoops, I hit the wrong one,\nthis is actually kind of a Paint.\n\n273\n00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.140\nRemember Microsoft Paint?\n\n274\n00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.410\nIf you've ever played around in Windows,\nthey have Microsoft Paint.\n\n275\n00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.770\nThis is the earlier version of it.\n\n276\n00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.730\nI'm gonna cancel out of it because\nthere's really not much that I can\n\n277\n00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:17.500\ndo associated with it, but\nyou can see how this works.\n\n278\n00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.550\nAnd this was the early days of computing.\n\n279\n00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.688\nWe're really talking about the 80s and\nearly,\n\n280\n00:15:23.688 --> 00:15:28.080\nwell I think just basically the 80s, yeah.\n\n281\n00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the 90s,\nyou started coming out with Windows 95.\n\n282\n00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.815\nAnd then closer to 2000,\nthey had Windows ME.\n\n283\n00:15:34.815 --> 00:15:39.644\nAnd then I think we'll see in some later\nslides will pick up from around that time\n\n284\n00:15:39.644 --> 00:15:40.158\nframe.\n\n285\n00:15:40.158 --> 00:15:40.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, in some later slides.\n\n286\n00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.460\n&gt;&gt; Call me in to the modern times, yeah.\n\n287\n00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:47.131\n&gt;&gt; But I went through this whole history,\nand believe me machines have become much\n\n288\n00:15:47.131 --> 00:15:52.770\nmore capable with more capable operating\nsystems, allowing us to do a lot more.\n\n289\n00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:57.880\nAnd so it's really kinda,\nthis isn't nostalgic but you're lucky.\n\n290\n00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.910\n&gt;&gt; It's really cool to be\na part of that evolution and\n\n291\n00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.790\nto see it to transpire and\nunfold right in front of your eyes.\n\n292\n00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.614\nThat's really cool.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm sure for all of you,\n\n293\n00:16:04.614 --> 00:16:07.993\nyou'll see evolution today,\nthe most modern machines that we have,\n\n294\n00:16:07.993 --> 00:16:09.150\nperhaps Windows 10.\n\n295\n00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you'll be talking about it\nand telling your kids, and grandkids.\n\n296\n00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.182\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're gonna be telling them,\n\n297\n00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.171\nyou're gonna be showing\nthem the equivalent of DOS.\n\n298\n00:16:16.171 --> 00:16:18.025\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n299\n00:16:18.025 --> 00:16:18.709\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n300\n00:16:18.709 --> 00:16:21.440\n&gt;&gt; All right, well thank you for\nsharing that with us, Steve.\n\n301\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.460\nI think this time we're actually finished.\n\n302\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.530\nWe'll go ahead and wrap up.\n\n303\n00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.530\nBut don't go anywhere, we've got\nsome virtualization headed your way.\n\n304\n00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.520\nSo we'll go ahead and sign off for\nthis particular episode.\n\n305\n00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.730\nAnd I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n306\n00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:35.590\n&gt;&gt;

Welcome cyber patriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:17.598\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:21.681\nIn this particular episode, we're\ngonna be looking at virtual machines.\n\n7\n00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:25.560\nIn the last segment,\nwe were introduced to physical hardware.\n\n8\n00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.540\nBut we're kind of shifting\ngears here a little bit.\n\n9\n00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.240\nAnd to help us do that, we have\nprofessor Steve Linthicum with us today.\n\n10\n00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.640\nThanks for joining us today, Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.060\n&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.\n\n12\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.460\nSo let's get started\nwith virtual machines.\n\n13\n00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.220\nFirst of all, if you haven't\nplayed with virtual machines,\n\n14\n00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.440\nyou're probably wondering what they are.\n\n15\n00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.010\nAnd really, what they are is, from our\nview point, strictly from our view point,\n\n16\n00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.610\nthere a window inside\nof typically Windows.\n\n17\n00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.270\nSo, what I'm talking about here is,\nand let's see bring up my screen so\n\n18\n00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.358\nI can show you what a virtual\nmachine looks like.\n\n19\n00:00:56.358 --> 00:00:59.890\nBefore you, you're looking at a desktop.\n\n20\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.880\nAnd as a matter of fact,\nthis is my laptop in front of me.\n\n21\n00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.600\nAnd this is a Windows 10 desktop\ndown here, as you can see.\n\n22\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.350\n&gt;&gt; So that's your host operating system.\n\n23\n00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.350\n&gt;&gt; That's my host operating system that's\ninstalled on this physical hardware.\n\n24\n00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.150\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n25\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.900\n&gt;&gt; And then, this window in\nhere now where my cursor is,\n\n27\n00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.460\nthis window, this is a virtual machine.\n\n28\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.210\nThis is actually a virtual\nWindows 7 machine, so-\n\n29\n00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.230\n&gt;&gt; Another operating\n\n30\n00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.190\nsystem-\n&gt;&gt; Right-\n\n31\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.440\n&gt;&gt; Nested in your host operating system.\n\n32\n00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.700\nSo that would be your\nguest operating system.\n\n33\n00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.892\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nyou're using the right terminology.\n\n34\n00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:33.774\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n35\n00:01:33.774 --> 00:01:37.166\nyou're gonna hear us talking\nabout host and guest.\n\n36\n00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:41.990\nAnd that makes kinda sense\nbecause my guest operating system\n\n37\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.740\nis being hosted by the host,\nwhich is the Windows 10 operating system.\n\n38\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.700\n&gt;&gt; In the background, yeah.\n\n39\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.455\n&gt;&gt; So this is, and this is a standard\nsort of, and I click here,\n\n40\n00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:55.740\nyou've probably all seen this if\nyou played around with Windows 7.\n\n41\n00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.320\nIf I click here,\nthe control panel is going to come up.\n\n42\n00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.092\nAnd just your standard sort of set up.\n\n43\n00:02:02.092 --> 00:02:05.931\n&gt;&gt; So it just functions as\na normal physical computer would.\n\n44\n00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:07.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nNow, one of the things,\n\n45\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.980\nwhile I'm here in the control panel,\nis we have a whole bunch of choices.\n\n46\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.010\nThis is the default setting.\n\n47\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.060\nAnd I'm not fond of the default setting.\n\n48\n00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.860\nI've never been fond\n\n49\n00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.913\nof it because you have to-\n&gt;&gt; The\n\n50\n00:02:16.913 --> 00:02:17.830\ncategories-\n&gt;&gt; Yes-\n\n51\n00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.440\n&gt;&gt; You have to know where things\n\n52\n00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.970\nare in the categories.\n\n53\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.580\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so,\nwhat I always go for, just as a clue-\n\n54\n00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.610\n&gt;&gt; The classic view.\n\n55\n00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.930\n&gt;&gt; Well, I try to go back to\nthe classic view, which doesn't exist.\n\n56\n00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.310\nIt only existed in Windows 95.\n\n57\n00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.780\nSo when I was in Windows 98, I would move\neverything back to the classic view.\n\n58\n00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.520\nYou can't do that anymore.\n\n59\n00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.790\nIn 7, they stopped it.\n\n60\n00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.200\nYou can get as close as you can get,\nwhich is the small icons,\n\n61\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.250\nwhich are really small.\n\n62\n00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.650\nSo that's normally the avenue\nthat I default to,\n\n63\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.420\none of the first changes I make when\nI go into a Windows 7 environment.\n\n64\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.330\nAnother thing that you can do, and\nthis is a time for a clue as to what'll\n\n65\n00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.220\nreally be beneficial for you down\nthe road as you're in competition and\n\n66\n00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.430\nyou need to find things really quickly.\n\n67\n00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.010\nThere's this thing called God mode.\n\n68\n00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.979\nAnd God mode is a folder that you create,\nit's real simple to create.\n\n69\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.470\nAnd you actually right-click on the\ndesktop, for example, and you do new here.\n\n70\n00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.090\nAnd I'm just gonna create a folder, okay.\n\n71\n00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.570\nSo it's that simple.\n\n72\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.800\nAnd I can change the name of that folder,\nit's highlighted in blue.\n\n73\n00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.740\nAnd what I've done is I've gone\nto a website by using Google,\n\n74\n00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.240\njust typing in God Mode in Windows 7.\n\n75\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.820\nAnd there's a spring of text,\n\n76\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.880\nstarts out god mode, and\nthen a bunch of characters behind it.\n\n77\n00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.442\nI'm just gonna paste that in there, and\n\n78\n00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:48.790\nyou can see that's quite a, well,\nit's hard to describe what it is.\n\n79\n00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.460\nIt really doesn't matter what it is.\n\n80\n00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.530\nIt becomes God mode.\n\n81\n00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.810\nAnd in God mode,\nif you double-click on it,\n\n82\n00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.680\nit brings up everything in\nthe control panel and more.\n\n83\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.680\nAnd so\nyou can find things in here much easier.\n\n84\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.973\nIt's in alphabetical order.\n\n85\n00:04:05.973 --> 00:04:08.955\nI provide that as a clue cuz\nonce you get used to God mode,\n\n86\n00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:11.317\nyou'll never go back to the Control Panel.\n\n87\n00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:13.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm gonna have to try that,\nyeah.\n\n88\n00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n89\n00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.969\nSo again, the clue here is simply\ngo to Google type in God mode-\n\n90\n00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:20.843\n&gt;&gt; So do they have that for\n\n91\n00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:22.788\ndifferent operating systems,\nnewer versions?\n\n92\n00:04:22.788 --> 00:04:23.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they do.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.\n\n93\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.977\nVery cool.\n&gt;&gt; So, they have it for\n\n94\n00:04:24.977 --> 00:04:27.055\nall of the Windows,\nit's been going on forever.\n\n95\n00:04:27.055 --> 00:04:30.260\nAnd it's kind of a hidden\ncharacteristic out there.\n\n96\n00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.060\nBut it does make it a lot easier.\n\n97\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.129\nAnd incidentally, this particular version\nof Windows, that site that you go to that\n\n98\n00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:39.531\nI have at the end of each one of these\nslides where I'm updating fields.\n\n99\n00:04:39.531 --> 00:04:40.485\n&gt;&gt; Of your final thoughts?\n\n100\n00:04:40.485 --> 00:04:45.295\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in one of the segments, and it\nwell may be this segment, I identify for\n\n101\n00:04:45.295 --> 00:04:49.958\nyou where you can go and download\nWindows Workstation Operating Systems,\n\n102\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.340\na variety of them, and install them.\n\n103\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.620\nSo this is where you can\npractice installations of-\n\n104\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.610\n&gt;&gt; Now, do they get the free version?\n\n105\n00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.100\nOr is it something that's paid?\n\n106\n00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.140\n&gt;&gt; It's a timed version.\n\n107\n00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n108\n00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.300\nSo normally, they have what,\nabout 30 days or so, and\n\n109\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.880\nyou might need to reinstall afterwards?\n\n110\n00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that gives you enough time to\n\n111\n00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.000\njust-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n112\n00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.880\nit gives you the practice of reinstalling.\n\n113\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n114\n00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.700\n&gt;&gt; So it's really beneficial\nto go down this pathway.\n\n115\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.732\n&gt;&gt; Huge proponent of that.\n\n116\n00:05:13.732 --> 00:05:16.580\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna be talking about the MSDN,\n\n117\n00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.410\nwhich is something that you're entitled\nto as a CyberPatriot participant,\n\n118\n00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.240\nwhich allows you to get licensed\nversions of the software.\n\n119\n00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.610\nBut I wouldn't use them\nin this environment,\n\n120\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.730\nbecause this is a virtual environment,\na practice environment.\n\n121\n00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.210\nIf you were to build a machine,\nfor example, and\n\n122\n00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.950\nyou wanted a Windows 10 machine,\nyou can actually\n\n123\n00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.600\nbuild your machine, and for free-\n&gt;&gt; Right, and usually, because\n\n124\n00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.375\nthese virtual machines are so temporary-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n125\n00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:41.980\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we're playing with them,\nwe're sandboxing and learning, really.\n\n126\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.608\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so use the MSDN software-\n&gt;&gt; For your more permanent systems?\n\n127\n00:05:45.608 --> 00:05:46.220\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n128\n00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.810\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's gonna be licensed.\n\n129\n00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.030\nYou get thousands of\ndollars worth of software.\n\n130\n00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit's not like you can go ahead and\n\n131\n00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.110\nchange from one machine to another,\nbecause you actually,\n\n132\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.840\nMicrosoft creates a hardware\nprofile with that license key.\n\n133\n00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.980\nAnd they don't even tell us how they,\nwhat their prerequisites are for that.\n\n134\n00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n135\n00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.520\nif you modify your system to a certain\ndegree past their hardware profile,\n\n136\n00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.540\nthey have the right to go ahead and say I\ndon't think this is the original machine\n\n137\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.960\nyou installed this operating system on.\n\n138\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.426\n&gt;&gt; Right, so again, use, and we'll provide\nwith you with information in that thing,\n\n139\n00:06:20.426 --> 00:06:24.151\nthat are that I'm constantly updating\nrelative to getting a variety of\n\n140\n00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:28.140\noperating systems that you can use in\na virtualized environment like this.\n\n141\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.040\nYes, it times out after 30,\n45, 90 days, whatever it is.\n\n142\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.550\nBut this is a play environment, and so\nthat really doesn't matter because you're\n\n143\n00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.640\ngonna blow these virtual machines up and-\n&gt;&gt; Create them again.\n\n144\n00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.820\n&gt;&gt; Create them again, that's it.\n\n145\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.460\nThat's the cool thing about it.\n\n146\n00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.920\nSo let's go on to the slides.\n\n147\n00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.650\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nLet's take a look at my computer here,\n\n148\n00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.380\nand we'll see virtual machines.\n\n149\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.160\nAll right, getting started here.\n\n150\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.230\n&gt;&gt; So, here they tell us that\na virtual machine is an environment\n\n151\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.000\nsuch as program or operating system\nthat does not physically exist, but\n\n152\n00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.020\nis created within another environment.\n\n153\n00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.805\n&gt;&gt; Like you just showed us.\n\n154\n00:07:00.805 --> 00:07:06.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and to give you a sense of this,\nat my college, we were\n\n155\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.820\nat a point in time where we were expanding\nour server room, and we had expanded it.\n\n156\n00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.160\nWe had about 120 physical servers.\n\n157\n00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.120\nAnd with virtualization,\nwe went the other direction,\n\n158\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.430\nmeaning we reduced our physical hardware,\nbecause in a server environment,\n\n159\n00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.830\nutilizing BP servers,\nthat have lots of RAM,\n\n160\n00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:32.100\nlots of processing power,\nyou can run multiple virtual servers.\n\n161\n00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.622\nSo, a typical pattern would be\nto run perhaps like 10 virtual\n\n162\n00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:39.080\nservers on one physical server.\n\n163\n00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's why it's so popular.\n\n164\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.080\nI mean, it helps, number one,\nyou're reducing your carbon footprint.\n\n165\n00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.701\nSo if you're in a place,\nespecially like in Manhattan or\n\n166\n00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:50.853\nsomewhere where the rent's particularly\nhigh, you're reducing that physical space,\n\n167\n00:07:50.853 --> 00:07:53.276\nyou're better utilizing\nyour physical hardware.\n\n168\n00:07:53.276 --> 00:07:56.657\nBecause with your virtual machine,\nyou take the physical hardware and\n\n169\n00:07:56.657 --> 00:07:58.909\nyou're just kind of slicing and\ndicing it up and\n\n170\n00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:01.292\nallocating it to those\ndifferent host machines.\n\n171\n00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:04.745\nSo you see this happening all the time.\n\n172\n00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:09.484\nA lot of companies utilize that because\nthey're monetary benefits you know,\n\n173\n00:08:09.484 --> 00:08:11.150\nenvironmental benefits.\n\n174\n00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.680\nWe do have some issues with that,\n\n175\n00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.620\nbut I'm going to wait till we get there\nand let you tell us about this, Steve.\n\n176\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n177\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.510\nOkay, so\njust wanted to give you a sense of that.\n\n178\n00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.920\nIt doesn't have hardware.\n\n179\n00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.090\nIt doesn't have a power supply.\n\n180\n00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.400\nIt doesn't have any of this stuff.\n\n181\n00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.630\nIt has virtualized\ncomponents in essence that-\n\n182\n00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.020\n&gt;&gt; It's just piggybacking\n\n183\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.090\noff without host machine.\n\n184\n00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.280\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n185\n00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.585\nSo it essentially allows you to run and,\nas you see, some from my desktop.\n\n186\n00:08:35.585 --> 00:08:38.225\nA computer inside of a computer.\n\n187\n00:08:38.225 --> 00:08:41.210\nAs a matter of fact, you can run\nmultiple computers inside of a computer.\n\n188\n00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.727\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't think Windows has any kind of\n\n189\n00:08:43.727 --> 00:08:49.699\ncustomer support for those multiple nested\nsystems but theoretically it's possible.\n\n190\n00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:51.619\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo let's move on.\n\n191\n00:08:51.619 --> 00:08:56.890\n&gt;&gt; All right Oops didn't-\n&gt;&gt; Didn't change, nope.\n\n192\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.340\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; Okay there we go.\n\n193\n00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.510\nOkay, well the advantages and here we go.\n\n194\n00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.670\nFlexibility.\n\n195\n00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.020\nIt can run multiple operating\nsystems on one physical machine.\n\n196\n00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:10.330\nHere at times, I'll be running Ubuntu and\nI'll be running Windows on top of Windows.\n\n197\n00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.850\n&gt;&gt; And you talked about, earlier, when\nwe were looking at those applications.\n\n198\n00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.820\nThis would be perfect for someone who\nwas developing a software application.\n\n199\n00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.450\nSo they could test it in multiple\nenvironments without having to\n\n200\n00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.490\nhop from machine to machine.\n\n201\n00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.340\nThey could just go ahead and\ntest it right there.\n\n202\n00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.869\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, scalability,\nyou can run multiple machines.\n\n203\n00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.660\nIn one physical machine, and yet scalable.\n\n204\n00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.420\nTo give you a sense of what\nscalability also involves.\n\n205\n00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.780\nIn large companies at eight o'clock in\nthe morning when everybody shows up,\n\n206\n00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.290\neverybody's on their computer.\n\n207\n00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.510\nAnd so, we need more servers,\nwe need more capacity to handle this.\n\n208\n00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.840\nAnd so, they could be brought up.\n\n209\n00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.710\nThey could be in a sleep mode, for\nexample and be brought up and so\n\n210\n00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.000\nwe can expand our server environment.\n\n211\n00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.240\n&gt;&gt; On an as-needed basis.\n\n212\n00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n213\n00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.390\n&gt;&gt; And that's why we're seeing cloud\ncomputing being so popular as well.\n\n214\n00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.180\nWe see that elasticity\nthat you're explaining\n\n215\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.320\nbeing used in a very clever way.\n\n216\n00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.410\n&gt;&gt; Right and, you know, it's hard,\nwe always talk about the cloud.\n\n217\n00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.530\nIf it weren't for virtualization,\nthere wouldn't be a cloud.\n\n218\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.040\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; There wouldn't be the cloud.\n\n219\n00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.070\nPortability, we can\ntransfer virtual computers\n\n220\n00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.450\nfrom one physical machine to another.\n\n221\n00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.390\nAnd the reason we might\nwant to do that is.\n\n222\n00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:30.790\nLet's pretend my laptop is a server and\nit's got 10 virtual machines on it, and\n\n223\n00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.140\nit's time for maintenance.\n\n224\n00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.780\nWe've got a critical maintenance need,\nfor example.\n\n225\n00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.840\nWe could transfer those ten virtual\nmachine to other physical machines.\n\n226\n00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.540\n&gt;&gt; With essentially no down time, because\nI can go ahead and copy a virtual machine,\n\n227\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.800\nget it running on the other one.\n\n228\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.270\nShut the other down and\nwe don't have that downtime for\n\n229\n00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.890\nmaintenance that we saw in the past.\n\n230\n00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.750\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and so,\nwe can transfer the virtuals off.\n\n231\n00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.360\nShut down the physical box.\n\n232\n00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.250\nDo what we have to do\nrelative to the physical box.\n\n233\n00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.710\nMaybe it's replace a power supply.\n\n234\n00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.839\nMaybe it's other physical issues.\n\n235\n00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.590\nAnd then bring it back up and\neffectively drag\n\n236\n00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.000\nthose other virtual machines that\nwere originally on here back to here.\n\n237\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.150\nSo, that's really cool.\n\n238\n00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.950\nCost, well there's some\nobvious cost savings here.\n\n239\n00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:22.440\nWe talked briefly about the environmental\nissues think about heating and\n\n240\n00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.780\ncooling\n&gt;&gt; Yea.\n\n241\n00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.870\n&gt;&gt; We dont think much about heating,\nbecause these things are heaters.\n\n242\n00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:27.850\nBut oftentimes,\n\n243\n00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:32.520\nyou have to have air conditioning running\nto cool the room down, so that they're at\n\n244\n00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.280\na effective operating temperature\n&gt;&gt; Yea,\n\n245\n00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.200\nmachines are driving a lot of heat and\nSteve, we even talked about\n\n246\n00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.630\nthis during breaks You see some data\ncenters like Facebook and so forth.\n\n247\n00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.730\nThey're moving to really cold regions and\n\n248\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.220\ntaking advantage of that colder\nclimate because of this fact.\n\n249\n00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.800\nTo help save with that cost.\n\n250\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.280\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nlet me see where were we on this slide?\n\n251\n00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.770\n&gt;&gt; Less physical machines down\nhere at the bottom for cost.\n\n252\n00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.220\nLess physical machines equating\nto less power consumption.\n\n253\n00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.380\nPurchasing those physical machines, so\nwe're utilizing our full hardware here.\n\n254\n00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:10.280\n&gt;&gt; Right exactly, so there are lots of\ncost benefits associated with this and\n\n255\n00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.710\nagain, floor space,\nwe don't have to use as much.\n\n256\n00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.530\nA whole variety of reasons why we're\nmoving over into this virtualized\n\n257\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.360\nenvironment and doing so ever so quickly.\n\n258\n00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.800\nIt's where it's headed.\n\n259\n00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo businesses care about saving money and\n\n260\n00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.140\ntheir rights.\n\n261\n00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.720\n&gt;&gt; This is a security class.\n\n262\n00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.870\nSecurity, we're talking about security.\n\n263\n00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.650\nWell there's a lot of good security\nreasons for going into this environment.\n\n264\n00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.080\nSo when we talk about,\nfor example, patching.\n\n265\n00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.440\nIf we have all of these\nvirtual servers running,\n\n266\n00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.950\nyou can associate the baseline\noperating system of each of them.\n\n267\n00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.100\nAnd you could patch at that level and\n\n268\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.100\nit would automatically effectively\nmirror up to all of these servers.\n\n269\n00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.640\nSo, you're cost associate\nwith staying current,\n\n270\n00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.100\nkeeping your systems patched,\ncan be far less.\n\n271\n00:12:59.100 --> 00:12:59.720\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n272\n00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.720\nThere.\nWe.\n\n273\n00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.080\nAs network admins and system admins,\nyou're going to find things that will help\n\n274\n00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.220\nimprove your performance as an employee.\n\n275\n00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.430\nIn smarter, more efficient ways and\nthat's what it's about, too.\n\n276\n00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.955\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYeah.\n\n277\n00:13:14.955 --> 00:13:15.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n278\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.790\nso of course,\nwe talked about the advantages.\n\n279\n00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.490\nSure.\n\n280\n00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:22.833\n&gt;&gt; And I think we should perhaps shift\nto the disadvantages [CROSSTALK].\n\n281\n00:13:22.833 --> 00:13:24.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou guys should be aware of those.\n\n282\n00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:28.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so performance depends\nupon the host machine's hardware.\n\n283\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.900\nFor example, on my particular laptop\nhere I've got 16 gigs of RAM,\n\n284\n00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.230\nI think, or 32, I can't remember which.\n\n285\n00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:43.790\nBut my guest Needed RAM, it's going to\nneed part of that overall RAM that I have.\n\n286\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.430\n&gt;&gt; The physical RAM.\n\n287\n00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.070\n&gt;&gt; The physical RAM, so I can allocate.\n\n288\n00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.600\nBut obviously,\nI can't put on 60 gigs of RAM when I got-\n\n289\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.660\n&gt;&gt; On your virtual machine,\n\n290\n00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.392\nbecause you really don't\nhave 60 gigs of RAM [LAUGH].\n\n291\n00:13:54.392 --> 00:13:55.055\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I won't.\n\n292\n00:13:55.055 --> 00:13:57.884\nSo it's performance is dependent\nupon the host machine.\n\n293\n00:13:57.884 --> 00:13:59.890\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And its capabilities.\n\n294\n00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.170\nIt's a single point of failure.\n\n295\n00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.650\nThat means that if I've got\nthis particular machine and\n\n296\n00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.820\nI'm running ten servers on it.\n\n297\n00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.030\nAnd all of a sudden it breaks-\n&gt;&gt; You have a hardware failure.\n\n298\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it just doesn't impact\nthe host operating system.\n\n299\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.430\nIt impacts the host-\n&gt;&gt; All of those ten guests!\n\n300\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.190\n&gt;&gt; And the guests.\n\n301\n00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:15.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n302\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.930\n&gt;&gt; So that's a single point of failure.\n\n303\n00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:22.860\nAlthough there are mechanisms that we\ncan use that soften that blow a bit.\n\n304\n00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.320\nWe can be running multiple VMs that\nare just basically replicating.\n\n305\n00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.180\n&gt;&gt; Think clusters?\n\n306\n00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:28.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n307\n00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.150\nso-\n&gt;&gt; Luckily,\n\n308\n00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.930\nyou guys don't have to worry\nabout that right now [LAUGH].\n\n309\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nwe don't have to worry about that, okay?\n\n310\n00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.900\nBut But we can effectively\nmitigate some of the challenges.\n\n311\n00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.410\n&gt;&gt; With redundancies,\n\n312\n00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.720\nwe did talk about redundancy so clusters\nwould be an example of redundancy there.\n\n313\n00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.500\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen basically that last disadvantage is\n\n314\n00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.110\nkind of what we discussed earlier.\n\n315\n00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.770\nAs we utilize or\n\n316\n00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:55.480\ndedicate resources to the guest we're\nactually pulling them away from the host.\n\n317\n00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:01.070\nSo, rather than having the 16GB of memory\nthat my host operating system is enjoying.\n\n318\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.300\nOnce we bring on guests that reduces\nthe amount of RAM that's available and\n\n319\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.410\nprocessing power,\nthat we're sharing that out.\n\n320\n00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, these are all good points\nto definitely be aware of And\n\n321\n00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.620\nare software manufacturing companies.\n\n322\n00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.980\nLike let's take Windows for example.\n\n323\n00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.450\nThey know this is well too, right?\n\n324\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.960\nObviously, so\n\n325\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.120\nyou can even find a hyper Vee server\nversion that's strictly has no gooey.\n\n326\n00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.220\nThey slim it down, so that that operating\nsystem doesn't take a lot of resources.\n\n327\n00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:28.880\nBecause they know,\n\n328\n00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.470\nhey, you're going to be running this\nin a strictly virtual environment.\n\n329\n00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:35.130\nSo, you'll see different solutions out\nthere for these types of problems.\n\n330\n00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.410\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n331\n00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.610\nSo, let's proceed forward.\n\n332\n00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, virtual machine security.\n\n333\n00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.720\n&gt;&gt; Okay virtual machine security.\n\n334\n00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:50.550\nThere are opportunities for, and I guess\nthey are unfortunate opportunities.\n\n335\n00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:55.866\nFor example, running multiple single\nhost machine, but multiple guests here.\n\n336\n00:15:55.866 --> 00:16:01.987\nThere is the chance that you could jump\nfrom either the host A hacker could,\n\n337\n00:16:01.987 --> 00:16:07.920\nin effect, jump from the host machine\nto one of the VMs, one or more.\n\n338\n00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.870\n&gt;&gt; VM escaping.\n\n339\n00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:09.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n340\n00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.910\n&gt;&gt; Or a hacker could be inside of one VM,\n\n341\n00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.510\nmeaning connected to one VM, and they may\nbe able to reach another virtual machine.\n\n342\n00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.480\n&gt;&gt; To infiltrate that\nother virtual machine.\n\n343\n00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:19.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n344\n00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.890\nSo, if they're able to go ahead and\n\n345\n00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.110\nhave that skill level,\n\n346\n00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.540\nyou just wanna treat your virtual machines\nlike you would a regular machine.\n\n347\n00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So all those tips you already told us,\n\n348\n00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.830\nSteve, keeping the systems patched and\nwe'll talk a little more about hardening.\n\n349\n00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.480\nSo we wanna treat our virtual machines,\n\n350\n00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.680\nalthough they're not physical, they do\nrequire that same amount of attention.\n\n351\n00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.480\n&gt;&gt; So the whole idea here is you\nwanna keep them isolated and\n\n352\n00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.480\nyou want to keep them protected.\n\n353\n00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.630\nBecause it's the same as having\nphysical machines connected to the same\n\n354\n00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.180\nphysical network.\n\n355\n00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.290\nYou could jump from one\nphysical machine to another.\n\n356\n00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.760\nYou can do the same thing\nwith virtual machines.\n\n357\n00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.590\nSo you wanna keep them\nas isolated as you can.\n\n358\n00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.790\nYou can have isolated\nvirtual networks to do that.\n\n359\n00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.620\nSo there's all kind of cool\nthings that you can do.\n\n360\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.919\nI heard briefly mentioned,\nI haven't mentioned it and\n\n361\n00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:11.580\nshould have probably earlier,\nthe term hypervisor.\n\n362\n00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:17.330\nA hypervisor is actually an application or\nit could be an operating system.\n\n363\n00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.870\nWe have different types of hypervisors.\n\n364\n00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.790\nWe have what's called a bare-metal\nhypervisor which effectively\n\n365\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.720\nis the operating system\nthat runs on the hardware.\n\n366\n00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:31.440\nOr in the example that we have on my\nscreen, we're actually running Windows\n\n367\n00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.620\n7 inside of a hypervisor that is an\napplication that's running on Windows 10.\n\n368\n00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.410\n&gt;&gt; So that would be classified\nas a type 2 hypervisor verses\n\n369\n00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.220\ntype 1 with that bare-bones,\nbare hypervisor.\n\n370\n00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.270\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n371\n00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:50.880\nAnd there are some differences\nobviously between the two.\n\n372\n00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.720\nWith a bare metal hypervisor,\n\n373\n00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.810\nthe machines that are operating inside of\nit are probably operating a lot faster.\n\n374\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.580\n&gt;&gt; We're usually in a production\nenvironment, not for consumer use.\n\n375\n00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.010\nYou guys will probably be working\nwith that type two hypervisor.\n\n376\n00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.000\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n377\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.600\nAs a matter of fact,\n\n378\n00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.300\nthe type two hypervisor you're using is\nVMware Player which is a free version.\n\n379\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.180\nI showed you earlier in a slide\nwhere we were using VirtualBox.\n\n380\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.130\n&gt;&gt; Another free solution, yeah\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n381\n00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:21.220\nThe Cyber Patriot program\nuses VMware Player, so\n\n382\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.988\nwe'll be playing around with that a bit\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n383\n00:18:23.988 --> 00:18:26.900\n&gt;&gt; When we get into some later videos.\n\n384\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.130\nSo you just have to be concerned\nabout the security aspects.\n\n385\n00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.020\nIt doesn't matter that it's virtual,\nit still\n\n386\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.620\nis subjective to the same sort of-\n&gt;&gt; So keeping your systems up to date with\n\n387\n00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.780\nthose patches, installing any\nkind of anti malware software.\n\n388\n00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:44.635\nLike you mentioned, Steve, you might\neven consider modifying the network,\n\n389\n00:18:44.635 --> 00:18:49.390\nthe adapter configurations for that to\nhave a private internal environment.\n\n390\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.250\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n391\n00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.550\nSo anymore slides?\n\n392\n00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:57.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have VMware,\nwhich is what you were talking about it.\n\n393\n00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.800\nVMware is a brand of a type of hypervisor\nhere that Steve was mentioning.\n\n394\n00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.730\nYou guys will have the free version of\nthat to go ahead and play around with.\n\n395\n00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.920\nIt's a software program that's used\nto create and run virtual machines.\n\n396\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.540\nYou can build those virtual machines.\n\n397\n00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.170\nDon't let this topic scare you.\n\n398\n00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:17.700\nI think a lot of times, people are little\nbit intimidated by virtual machines, but\n\n399\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:22.100\nI promise you, it is not difficult to set\nup a virtual machine and it's really fun.\n\n400\n00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.590\nYou're gonna set one up and\nyou're gonna think, that was fast,\n\n401\n00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.200\nthat was easy, and you know what?\n\n402\n00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.030\nThis is pretty cool.\n\n403\n00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.230\nIt's really flexible,\n\n404\n00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.400\nit's really gonna make me an efficient,\nbetter tech, so get familiar with them.\n\n405\n00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.000\nThey're not going away any time soon.\n\n406\n00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.330\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n407\n00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:40.500\nThere are some files that are associated\nwhen you install a virtual machine.\n\n408\n00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.870\nThey're physical files on\nyour physical hard drive\n\n409\n00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.095\nthat are combined together to\ncreate this virtual machine.\n\n410\n00:19:49.095 --> 00:19:52.449\n&gt;&gt; You'e kind of emulating\nthe physical hard drive and\n\n411\n00:19:52.449 --> 00:19:56.130\nyou're creating these\nvirtual hard disk drives, and\n\n412\n00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.750\nthat's what your machine contains all of\nyour machine's setting and information.\n\n413\n00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.420\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n414\n00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.950\nSo it's-\n&gt;&gt; And these are some examples here.\n\n415\n00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:04.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n416\n00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.210\n&gt;&gt; VMDK, VMX, NVRAM.\n\n417\n00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:14.180\nFor Microsoft, you have VHD, and the newer\nversion of that is gonna be VHDX.\n\n418\n00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So those are the file extensions that\n\n419\n00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.360\nyou'll note whenever you're getting\nfamiliar with these systems.\n\n420\n00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.290\n&gt;&gt; And you will probably do like I do and\n\n421\n00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:26.560\ngo back and forth to different hypervisors\ndepending upon your wants and needs.\n\n422\n00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.830\nAs I mentioned earlier, I kinda like free.\n\n423\n00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:32.120\nAnd Virtual Box has a lot of-\n&gt;&gt; I'm kinda stuck in Microsoft land.\n\n424\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:32.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's why\n\n425\n00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.930\nyou'll always hear me talking about\nHypervisor, although here at ITProTV,\n\n426\n00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.570\nwe've got VMWare Fusion\nrunning on these laptops.\n\n427\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.933\n&gt;&gt; The bottom line is\nas your needs expand,\n\n428\n00:20:44.933 --> 00:20:49.241\nyou'll undoubtedly expand\nbeyond VMware Player.\n\n429\n00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:53.253\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you will see that growing pains\nand you'll outgrow that free software.\n\n430\n00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:56.390\n&gt;&gt; Right, but you also got that other\nfree choice which is Virtual Box and\n\n431\n00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:00.810\nI keep coming back to it because it\nprovides a lot of the capabilities of\n\n432\n00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.850\nthe VMware workstation product.\n\n433\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:04.880\nNot the player product, but\n\n434\n00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.960\nthe workstation product\nwhich you have to pay for.\n\n435\n00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.410\nSo that would be my second\npoint of migration for\n\n436\n00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.590\nthose of you who are trying to\nlearn more about virtualization.\n\n437\n00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.105\n&gt;&gt; But you've got access to all\nthe tools to get you started here, so\n\n438\n00:21:17.105 --> 00:21:18.223\nthat's definitely a plus.\n\n439\n00:21:18.223 --> 00:21:19.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n440\n00:21:19.365 --> 00:21:21.730\n&gt;&gt; The next topic here today is checksums.\n\n441\n00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.950\nWe mentioned hash algorithms\nearlier today, so\n\n442\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.020\nwhat are we looking at here, Steve?\n\n443\n00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.370\n&gt;&gt; Well, what happens, and\n\n444\n00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:32.220\nthis is kind of an introduction to what\nyou will be facing in the competition.\n\n445\n00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:37.940\nYour coach will actually receive an email\nthat will allow your coach to go out and\n\n446\n00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.970\ndownload the images, and\nthese are virtual images.\n\n447\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.260\n&gt;&gt; And when you say image,\nan image is basically what?\n\n448\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.680\nAn entire screenshot of that\nentire operating system?\n\n449\n00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.570\n&gt;&gt; Well, in essence, we probably\noveruse that term, first of all, but\n\n450\n00:21:53.570 --> 00:22:00.370\nwhen I talk about an image,\noftentimes, how can I explain this?\n\n451\n00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.580\nOperating systems, when we used to\ninstall them, and I know earlier,\n\n452\n00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.370\nwe were talking about using floppy disks.\n\n453\n00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is a good way to explain it.\n\n454\n00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:11.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but\nthey really come out as a CD generally.\n\n455\n00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have a DVD or CD-ROM that\ncame from the manufacturer with that\n\n456\n00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.550\noperating system installation\ndisk already on there.\n\n457\n00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.970\nThey don't ship those anymore.\n\n458\n00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:21.495\n&gt;&gt; No, they don't.\n\n459\n00:22:21.495 --> 00:22:22.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n460\n00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.910\nwhat they do ship are what\nare called ISO files.\n\n461\n00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.380\n&gt;&gt; Or ISOs, and\nthey normally don't even ship those.\n\n462\n00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:34.220\nWe just get them from-\n&gt;&gt; The internet and we download them.\n\n463\n00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:39.040\nAnd so what's happening here is\nthat your coach is in essence\n\n464\n00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.625\ngetting something equivalent,\nand I say equivalent.\n\n465\n00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:45.500\nIt's not exactly like\nan ISO because an ISO\n\n466\n00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.760\nis in essence a snapshot of that CD or\nDVD.\n\n467\n00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.640\nAnd you would go through and\ndo the whole installation process,\n\n468\n00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.750\nyour standard installation of, for\nexample, Windows from an ISO file.\n\n469\n00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.360\nWhat your coach is gonna\nget is an already up and\n\n470\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:05.260\nrunning virtual machine,\na snapshot of that virtual machine.\n\n471\n00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:10.050\nAnd your coach is going to unpack\nit because it's zipped up.\n\n472\n00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.780\nIt's-\n&gt;&gt; Compressed for transmission.\n\n473\n00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:17.220\n&gt;&gt; It's compressed for transmission and\nit's also password protected.\n\n474\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:22.115\nAnd so when your coach receives that\nemail, your coach gets the email,\n\n475\n00:23:22.115 --> 00:23:24.040\ndownloads the image, and\n\n476\n00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.850\nthis will typically happen\nwhen we're doing competitions.\n\n477\n00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:31.970\nI think we talk about this a little bit\nlater, but it will be a few days before,\n\n478\n00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.300\nand then your coach will get a password to\n\n479\n00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:41.320\nunpack it And\nthen it will be placed on your machine.\n\n480\n00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.950\nAnd then they'll go through the process,\neither you with your coach, or\n\n481\n00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:51.220\nyour coach independently, of loading\nthat operating operating system,\n\n482\n00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.232\nthat virtual operating\nsystem on the VMware player.\n\n483\n00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:57.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nif we take a look at my screen, it'll\n\n484\n00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.560\nshow you some of those steps that Steve\nwas just describing in that process there,\n\n485\n00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.340\nand thta gives you a little break down.\n\n486\n00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:08.320\nAnd you guys have a access to these\nslides also through your tool,\n\n487\n00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.278\nyour portal, and your coach there.\n\n488\n00:24:10.278 --> 00:24:11.350\n&gt;&gt; Through your coach.\n\n489\n00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:14.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, I think that if you\ndon't have any other final thoughts,\n\n490\n00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.980\nthen we'll go ahead and\nwrap up for this episode.\n\n491\n00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.510\nWhat do we have coming up here?\n\n492\n00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.490\nGive you a little teaser, networking,\none of my ultimate favorites,\n\n493\n00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.050\ncoming up next, so stay tuned.\n\n494\n00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.530\nWe've got some good\ncontent coming your way.\n\n495\n00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.460\nBut for this particular episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n496\n00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:35.350\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign out as your host, Cherokee Boose, and\n\n497\n00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.540\nwe have Professor Steve Linthicum with us\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n498\n00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.585\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n499\n00:24:40.585 --> 00:24:44.065\ncatch you next time back\nhere at Cyber Patriot.\n\n500\n00:24:44.065 --> 00:24:50.128\n[MUSIC]\n\n501\n00:24:50.128 --> 00:24:51.915\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:14.922\n&gt;&gt; Welcome CyberPatriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n6\n00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:16.340\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.320\nIn this episode, we're gonna be looking at\nmy personal favorite, networking basics.\n\n8\n00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.270\nAnd with us today we have\nProfessor Steve Linthicum to go ahead and\n\n9\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.910\nintroduce us to this very vast and\nwide topic.\n\n10\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.603\nThank you for being with us today Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:32.660\n&gt;&gt; Hi, my pleasure.\n\n12\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.040\nAnd it is a wide and vast topic.\n\n13\n00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.570\nAs a matter of fact we at my college\nwe have a course it's basically,\n\n14\n00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.370\nnetworking basics that lasts for 18 weeks,\nit goes for about 4 hours a week, so that\n\n15\n00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.793\nif I do my math correctly I think were\nup into the, getting close to 100 hours.\n\n16\n00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:54.452\nNow obviously we're not gonna spend 100\nhours with you on networking basics,\n\n17\n00:00:54.452 --> 00:00:56.159\nwere gonna spend about 15 minutes.\n\n18\n00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.643\nAnd so we're gonna keep it real basic,\nbut the good news is and\n\n19\n00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:06.335\nyou'll see this in a later slide, that\nyou have access to the Cisco Academy and\n\n20\n00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:12.930\nlots of courses, lots of information there\nthat you can take by way of their modules.\n\n21\n00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.390\nSo we're gonna keep it really basic.\n\n22\n00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.340\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSounds good.\n\n23\n00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.350\nI'll try.\nIt's gonna be hard for\n\n24\n00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.860\nme but [LAUGH] all right.\n\n25\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so looking at this first\nslide in the slide deck, and\n\n26\n00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.200\nthere are only three that\nwe're gonna be looking at.\n\n27\n00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.120\nThis is a representation of a variety\nof devices that exist out there.\n\n28\n00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.530\nAnd as you can see,\nthe first line item is servers.\n\n29\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.960\nAnd I wanna explain\nsomething about servers.\n\n30\n00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.170\nWhen I use that term,\nit's somewhat confusing.\n\n31\n00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.720\nIt's always been somewhat confusing for\nstudents in that if you go to your Windows\n\n32\n00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.300\n7 machine, and you decide\n\n33\n00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.220\nthat people are gonna print through\nthat machine, it is providing a service.\n\n34\n00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.110\nAnd so it is a server.\n\n35\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.160\nAnd if you-\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n36\n00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.220\n&gt;&gt; Decide to share your files and\nfolders out, and other people\n\n37\n00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.350\non the network are coming to your\nmachine to get those folders or files.\n\n38\n00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.570\nIt is a server.\n\n39\n00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.650\nIt is providing a service.\n\n40\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.545\nSo the fact that we talk about servers,\nand often times we do,\n\n41\n00:02:12.545 --> 00:02:16.830\nas being something that exists in\na data center isn't necessarily true.\n\n42\n00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.020\nYour own workstation could be a server.\n\n43\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.270\n&gt;&gt; Even though it is running\nthat client operating system,\n\n44\n00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.030\nit's providing a service to others on your\nnetwork, so that's the definition there.\n\n45\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.410\nDon't get too boxed in, and\nthat's just the beginning with networking,\n\n46\n00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.860\nyou have to really kind of keep your mind\nopen when you're discussing devices.\n\n47\n00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.381\nBecause we have so many options nowadays\nthat it's not always cut and dry,\n\n48\n00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:43.684\nblack and white, there are some kind\nof grey areas that we just need to,\n\n49\n00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:46.434\nit's kind of really exciting though Steve.\n\n50\n00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:50.885\nBecause you think of something in your\nhead, and this is not just with networking\n\n51\n00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:55.350\nbut in any kind of computing and\nyou say, is it possible to do this?\n\n52\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.350\nWell, the answer is yes.\n\n53\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.930\nEven though something doesn't exist\nat this present moment in time,\n\n54\n00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.350\nit's probably doable.\n\n55\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.390\nAnd so that's kind of the really,\nreally cool thing about working in IT.\n\n56\n00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n57\n00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.470\nAnd so if we get back to the slide and\ngo through a few of these other devices.\n\n58\n00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.040\nSwitches.\n\n59\n00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.917\nNow when I started in networking,\nwell nobody could afford switches,\n\n60\n00:03:15.917 --> 00:03:17.220\nI guess is the point.\n\n61\n00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.370\nWe probably had them.\n\n62\n00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.830\nWe called them bridges.\n\n63\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.750\n&gt;&gt; Or hubs.\n\n64\n00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.350\n&gt;&gt; Well hubs was the standard back then.\n\n65\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.864\nAnd a hub is nothing more than\nsome signals come in one port.\n\n66\n00:03:28.864 --> 00:03:33.420\nAnd when we talk about ports, as you can\nsee on the front of that switch up there,\n\n67\n00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.610\nthose are where you would plug cables in.\n\n68\n00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.250\nSo a signal would come in\none of those ports and\n\n69\n00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.870\nthen it would be sent out all the ports.\n\n70\n00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.440\nIt wasn't a smart device.\n\n71\n00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because what you're\ndoing is generating traffic,\n\n72\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.230\nand you've been here in Gainesville.\n\n73\n00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.760\nTraffic's no fun,\nno one likes traffic, right.\n\n74\n00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Especially when it's\n\n75\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.105\nuncontrolled traffic.\n\n76\n00:03:54.105 --> 00:03:56.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's the function of a switch.\n\n77\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.090\nA switch is a computer, basically,\n\n78\n00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.580\neverything on this screen's\na computer except for the people.\n\n79\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:11.030\nBut a switch is a computer,\na switch has memory, it has a processor.\n\n80\n00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.240\nWhat happens is a signal comes in, and the\nswitch eventually learns what computers or\n\n81\n00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.430\nwhat devices are connected up to the port.\n\n82\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.290\nAnd so a signal comes in\nto go to another port, and\n\n83\n00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.190\nthe switch knows based upon addressing\nwhat wire is sending that out.\n\n84\n00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.338\nSo rather than sending it out all of\nthe ports like a hub would do it,\n\n85\n00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:35.510\nit sends it out a single one to\nthe recipient, to the intended recipient.\n\n86\n00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.100\nSo that's kind of sort of the way, yes.\n\n87\n00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.000\n&gt;&gt; Reducing the traffic,\nmore intelligent way,\n\n88\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.650\nthat's why we see these smarter devices\nbeing used in our modern networks.\n\n89\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n90\n00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.220\nAnd a router is similar to a switch,\nbut what it's designed to do\n\n91\n00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.520\nis to send traffic out of\nthe network to another network.\n\n92\n00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.780\nThat's probably the best\nway to look at it.\n\n93\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.500\n&gt;&gt; Aside from, yeah going into the OSI\nmodel with the layers, and the addressing.\n\n94\n00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.363\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe're not gonna do that to you guys today.\n\n95\n00:05:02.363 --> 00:05:04.237\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're not gonna do that.\n\n96\n00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:06.244\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're not gonna do that.\n\n97\n00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:08.150\n&gt;&gt; So I like your description there, yeah.\n\n98\n00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.800\n&gt;&gt; The router that they've\nidentified here, in the upper, well,\n\n99\n00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.260\nnext to the world, up there.\n\n100\n00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.710\nNotice that it has some\nthings sticking up.\n\n101\n00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.212\nAnd those are antennas, and so\nthis is probably that pretty standard,\n\n102\n00:05:19.212 --> 00:05:22.144\nsort of,\nwireless router that you have at home.\n\n103\n00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:23.470\n&gt;&gt; An all in one.\n\n104\n00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah and so\nit's a switch because the internal network\n\n105\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.040\nis being switched, and\nin effect it's a router because it's\n\n106\n00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.160\nrouting traffic out to the Internet and\nback from the Internet to your machines.\n\n107\n00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.430\nThe interesting thing about and\n\n108\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.160\nwe mentioned earlier-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n109\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.700\nthese devices are working as a team here?\n\n110\n00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n111\n00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.400\nThe interesting thing is those\nantennas that are sticking up,\n\n112\n00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.890\nthey're using the airwaves, okay.\n\n113\n00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.180\nAnd they're using typically\na single frequency,\n\n114\n00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.740\nmeaning they're behaving much like\na hub in that all the traffic,\n\n115\n00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.820\nthe wireless traffic,\nis sharing that same media.\n\n116\n00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.790\nAnd so they have to take turns\ncommunicating, the computers,\n\n117\n00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.080\nmy laptop when it's hooked up to a\nwireless network, it has to wait its turn\n\n118\n00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.920\nto communicate with that,\nbasically an access point.\n\n119\n00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.440\nThat's the aspect with the antennas, and\nso it behaves much like a hub environment.\n\n120\n00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.690\nThat's why wireless is generally slower.\n\n121\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Steve,\nwireless is so popular.\n\n122\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.720\nIt's really flexible,\nI can walk around with my devices.\n\n123\n00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.130\nFrom a security standpoint and\n\n124\n00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.570\nmaybe there are other benefits that\nyou might want to mention as well.\n\n125\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.310\nWhy do we see companies\nstill using old cable?\n\n126\n00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.910\nWho uses that stuff anymore?\n\n127\n00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.770\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit's because of the speed primarily.\n\n128\n00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.760\n&gt;&gt; Speed, number one.\n\n129\n00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.330\n&gt;&gt; Right, and security, number two.\n\n130\n00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because, guess what?\n\n131\n00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:52.467\nYeah, if I can access the airways,\nso can some hacker out there, yeah.\n\n132\n00:06:52.467 --> 00:06:53.760\n&gt;&gt; Very easier than a wired network.\n\n133\n00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes, much easier than wired.\n\n134\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.740\nYou have to tap in in some fashion,\nand it's easy to tap into the airways.\n\n135\n00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because\n\n136\n00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.610\nall you gotta do is to have a wireless\ncard on your machine and you're attached.\n\n137\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.910\nThe final device that they\nmention here is a firewall, and\n\n138\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.900\noften times this is built into this device\nthat has the antennas on it at your home.\n\n139\n00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.300\nThis is your firewall protecting your\n\n140\n00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.280\nnetwork from bad things coming in or-\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of your\n\n141\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.560\nfirst line of defense there.\n\n142\n00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.715\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n143\n00:07:25.715 --> 00:07:28.940\nAnd this is a firewall device.\n\n144\n00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.000\nMany of our operating\nsystems on a host base.\n\n145\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.270\nWe're talking about, again,\nour Windows 7 machine for example.\n\n146\n00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.280\nThey have their own built-in firewall.\n\n147\n00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.275\n&gt;&gt; The Windows Firewall in the software.\n\n148\n00:07:40.275 --> 00:07:42.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And we don't have to pick and\n\n149\n00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.410\nchoose here.\n\n150\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.990\nIt's actually recommended to use both.\n\n151\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.460\nA network firewall in addition\nto your host-based firewall.\n\n152\n00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.040\nThey're not gonna be conflicting there,\n\n153\n00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.532\nthey're just gonna be\nrestricting that access.\n\n154\n00:07:53.532 --> 00:07:56.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, and one of the points\nhere with this diagram is,\n\n155\n00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.070\nnotice the machine that\nis on the Internet.\n\n156\n00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.750\nIt is the router.\n\n157\n00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.930\nOkay, so\nit has physical access to the internet.\n\n158\n00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.230\nAll the other devices have\nkind of a secondary access\n\n159\n00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.898\nthat are inside our network.\n\n160\n00:08:09.898 --> 00:08:15.160\nAnd so it's a wise thing not to, for\nexample, connect to your laptop but\n\n161\n00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.990\ndirectly to your modem,\nyou call it a modem, its not a modem.\n\n162\n00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.370\nBut your DSL modem, or\n\n163\n00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.510\nyour cable modem, because it\nbecomes the device on the Internet.\n\n164\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.785\nAnd you don't want that, you want it\ninsulated, you want it in a private\n\n165\n00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:34.822\nnetwork, not with a public IP\naddress that's part of the Internet.\n\n166\n00:08:34.822 --> 00:08:38.155\n&gt;&gt; And because this router's sitting\nhere on the perimeter of our network,\n\n167\n00:08:38.155 --> 00:08:40.795\nwe could also hear the term\ndefault gateway being used.\n\n168\n00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:42.455\nSo don't get confused.\n\n169\n00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:43.605\nDifferent vendors.\n\n170\n00:08:43.605 --> 00:08:47.150\nYou'll learn about that as you progress,\nbut just to kind of throw some extra terms\n\n171\n00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.566\nout there for\nyou like you don't have enough already.\n\n172\n00:08:49.566 --> 00:08:52.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's go on to the next slide.\n\n173\n00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.580\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n174\n00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.898\n&gt;&gt; And\nsome of this we've basically talked about.\n\n175\n00:08:55.898 --> 00:09:00.780\nWireless access points, again on our\ndiagram that was actually that thing with\n\n176\n00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:06.160\nthe antennas, it's a combination\naccess point router switch.\n\n177\n00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.660\nAccess, users given access to more\ndata and devices on the network than\n\n178\n00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:18.030\nnecessary can inadvertently, or\npurposefully, cause security issues.\n\n179\n00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.140\nWe need to harden our network.\n\n180\n00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.640\nWe need to make sure that, for\n\n181\n00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.910\nexample at my college we have\na Student Health Services department.\n\n182\n00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.390\nAnd there are legal reasons\nwhy that department's\n\n183\n00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.510\nequipment shouldn't be on\nthe general network for\n\n184\n00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.320\nthe college because of privacy\nconcerns relating to health records.\n\n185\n00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.350\nSo we need to design our\nnetworks with security in mind.\n\n186\n00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.730\n&gt;&gt; And if you guys hear this term NAC,\nnetwork access control,\n\n187\n00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.660\nthat's exactly what Steve's\nmentioning in here.\n\n188\n00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.040\nYou're just controlling who\nhas access to your network.\n\n189\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n190\n00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.140\nEmail, guess what?\n\n191\n00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.330\nWe all know about email, we all know\nabout how we can be tricked into\n\n192\n00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.560\ngiving information through phishing,\ntax, we've already talked about that.\n\n193\n00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.030\nFirewall, it may be improperly configured.\n\n194\n00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:08.860\nOftentimes it is, and\nthe reason it is particularly in a home\n\n195\n00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:14.240\nenvironment is because security\ncan often eliminate our ability\n\n196\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.940\nto do things in an open environment,\nopen for example wireless environment.\n\n197\n00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.409\n&gt;&gt; The Xbox isn't working with\nthose secure settings, so\n\n198\n00:10:21.409 --> 00:10:25.390\nyou know what let's just take those secure\nsettings off so I can play my games.\n\n199\n00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.230\n&gt;&gt; And it's much easier,\nrather then selecting secure settings,\n\n200\n00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.700\nto take them all off And that's not a lie.\n\n201\n00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.000\n&gt;&gt; A lot of router companies have\nrealized that people do that.\n\n202\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.820\nAnd that's where you'll see UPNP for\nUniversal Plug and Play.\n\n203\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.060\nThere's a lot of routers at the home\nversions have that setting because\n\n204\n00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.040\npeople were doing that so\noften, but not all of them.\n\n205\n00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.247\n&gt;&gt; And of course there are security\nproblems with Universal Plug and Play.\n\n206\n00:10:50.247 --> 00:10:50.762\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n207\n00:10:50.762 --> 00:10:52.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah so.\n\n208\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.560\n&gt;&gt; That's another whole episode.\n\n209\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.600\nLike you said,\nyou've got your college courses.\n\n210\n00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.982\nThere are people, their entire careers\nare devoted for network engineers, and\n\n211\n00:11:00.982 --> 00:11:03.120\nthat's what they focus on.\n\n212\n00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.860\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nAnd\n\n213\n00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.790\nthen the final bulleted item\nhere is communications.\n\n214\n00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:11.770\nNetwork traffic contains confidential\ninformation, and I come back to this and\n\n215\n00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.460\nI'll repeat it, and I'll repeat it, and\nI'll repeat it, what we need to do for\n\n216\n00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:20.420\nsecurity is have encryption in storage and\nencryption in transit.\n\n217\n00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.970\nAnd they talk here about\nSecure Socket Layer technology.\n\n218\n00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.460\nThis is what happens when you go on\nthe Internet and you get that lock.\n\n219\n00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:33.070\nThat indicates that this sort of\nencryption of traffic is happening.\n\n220\n00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:36.380\n&gt;&gt; And another protocol would be TLS,\nTransport Layer Security.\n\n221\n00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.600\nIt's a little bit newer than SSL,\nbut it's used in that same way,\n\n222\n00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.990\nthat same concept to\nprovide that security.\n\n223\n00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.980\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n224\n00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.467\nSo, I think that is, do we have?\n\n225\n00:11:44.467 --> 00:11:48.534\n&gt;&gt; I think you had a link\nto the Cisco Network.\n\n226\n00:11:48.534 --> 00:11:50.950\nIf we wanted to show\nthat on the next slide.\n\n227\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.065\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go onto the next slide.\n\n228\n00:11:53.065 --> 00:11:53.565\n&gt;&gt; On your PC there.\nThere you go.\n\n229\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.030\n&gt;&gt; Where is it?\n\n230\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.143\n&gt;&gt; On your, the next slide.\n\n231\n00:11:57.143 --> 00:11:57.771\n&gt;&gt; Next slide, okay.\n\n232\n00:11:57.771 --> 00:11:59.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, next slide.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let me bring it up.\n\n233\n00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.540\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n234\n00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.350\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n235\n00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.670\nSorry about that.\n\n236\n00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.350\nSo this is the information relating\nto the Cisco Network Academy.\n\n237\n00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:10.403\nAs part of your becoming a team member\non a CyberPatriot team, your coach gives\n\n238\n00:12:10.403 --> 00:12:15.088\nyou access to this so you can go through\nand view the training materials.\n\n239\n00:12:15.088 --> 00:12:18.315\nThey have a number of modules.\n\n240\n00:12:18.315 --> 00:12:21.095\nThe coach is charged with\nthe responsibility of identifying\n\n241\n00:12:21.095 --> 00:12:24.915\nthe modules that you need to be\nstudying to being prepared for Cisco.\n\n242\n00:12:24.915 --> 00:12:29.585\n&gt;&gt; So take advantage of this wonderful\ntool that you guys have available to you.\n\n243\n00:12:29.585 --> 00:12:32.835\n&gt;&gt; Right, and one of the things that I\nwanted to point out relative to this,\n\n244\n00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:37.440\nit is becoming more and\nmore part of the CyberPatriot competition.\n\n245\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.710\nYou'll run into,\nnot only just playing with images,\n\n246\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.480\nand I use that term playing,\nbut trying to hardening them.\n\n247\n00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:49.666\nBut you're gonna find challenges\nthat relate to specific Cisco\n\n248\n00:12:49.666 --> 00:12:55.060\nhardware [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So start paying attention there, okay.\n\n249\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.590\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nSo basically, at the most rudimentary\n\n250\n00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:03.770\nlevel, a network is going to be two or\nmore devices communicating, all right.\n\n251\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.000\n[LAUGH] That's as simple as I can put it.\n\n252\n00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.560\nBut like we said,\nthere's a lot more to that.\n\n253\n00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.010\nSo here's a really good start,\n\n254\n00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.980\nand hopefully you're just as\nexcited about networking as we are.\n\n255\n00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.490\nSo stay tuned,\nwe have more information coming your way.\n\n256\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.740\nBut for this episode,\nwe'll go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n257\n00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.450\nSo signing off,\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n258\n00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.900\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n259\n00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.211\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at CyberPatriot.\n\n260\n00:13:23.211 --> 00:13:31.388\n[MUSIC]\n\n261\n00:13:31.388 --> 00:13:33.536\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Hi, great to be back.\n\n15\n00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.580\nYeah, we're gonna do some of\nthe history stuff, because,\n\n16\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.685\nas you can tell by my gray hair,\nI would qualify as a Microsoft historian.\n\n17\n00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:46.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Having experienced it since its initial\n\n18\n00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.140\noperating system, and\nthen going up to today.\n\n19\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.910\nSo we're gonna-\n&gt;&gt; We'll take advantage of that today.\n\n20\n00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.576\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll take advantage of that,\n\n21\n00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:55.058\nbecause if there is something I'm truly\nan expert in, it is that sort of history,\n\n22\n00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:58.048\nhaving used every one of the operating\nsystems I'm going to mention.\n\n23\n00:00:58.048 --> 00:01:02.673\nSo we're covering today,\nas you can see from this initial slide,\n\n24\n00:01:02.673 --> 00:01:05.690\nMicrosoft Windows Basics and MSDN.\n\n25\n00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.370\nAnd we're gonna talk in\nmore detail about MSDN.\n\n26\n00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.050\nBut you're really gonna\nbenefit from that program.\n\n27\n00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.400\nIt basically is something\nthat Microsoft has done.\n\n28\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.140\nI kind of often associate it with\nbeing like the ice cream man, and\n\n29\n00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.120\nmaking sure that children love ice cream.\n\n30\n00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.460\nAnd one of the ways you do that,\nis you probably give away your samples\n\n31\n00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.360\nwhen you go into a 31 Flavors,\nfor example, Baskin Robbins.\n\n32\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.886\nThey're always willing to\ngive you that little scoop of\n\n33\n00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:29.670\nice cream to get you hooked.\n\n34\n00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.839\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n35\n00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:32.680\n[LAUGH] And it's so good.\n\n36\n00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's kind of the MSDN function.\n\n37\n00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.390\nSo you're gonna be, as a Cyberpatriot\nteam member, one of the benefits\n\n38\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.000\nthat you're gonna get is MSDN, and\nthat's access for free, F-R-E-E, free.\n\n39\n00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.271\nTons of software and\nwe're gonna show you what that means.\n\n40\n00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:53.619\nYou're gonna be very happy I suspect,\nrelative to it.\n\n41\n00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.164\nSo let's go on to this first slide.\n\n42\n00:01:55.164 --> 00:02:00.580\nThis is the learning objectives for this\nparticular module, this particular unit.\n\n43\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.120\nAnd what's gonna happen is,\nwe're gonna help you understand\n\n44\n00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.890\nthe Microsoft Windows operating system and\nits basic history.\n\n45\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.832\nAgain I'm the historian.\n\n46\n00:02:08.832 --> 00:02:15.880\nSo we'll look at Windows operating system\nbasics, and the history of Windows.\n\n47\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.079\nAnd we're gonna talk about specific terms\nand definitions, according to Microsoft.\n\n48\n00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.839\nLet me give you a brief example of that.\n\n49\n00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.650\nWhen we talk about a printer,\nwhat do you think?\n\n50\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.405\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now you probably, yeah, right-\n\n51\n00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:30.105\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know where this is going,\n\n52\n00:02:30.105 --> 00:02:34.345\nit's very bizarre, but that's how\nMicrosoft wants to define itself.\n\n53\n00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:37.379\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we'll let him define it,\nbecause, you know, they're-\n\n54\n00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.386\n&gt;&gt; Usually I'm taking their tests, so\n\n55\n00:02:39.386 --> 00:02:43.207\nI have to kind of go with what they say,\nand that's how it is.\n\n56\n00:02:43.207 --> 00:02:45.347\n&gt;&gt; So,\nwhen you think about what a printer is,\n\n57\n00:02:45.347 --> 00:02:48.747\nyou're probably envisioning\nthis physical device.\n\n58\n00:02:48.747 --> 00:02:49.727\n&gt;&gt; Where you put the paper in.\n\n59\n00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:50.877\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you put the paper in.\n\n60\n00:02:50.877 --> 00:02:54.650\nYou put a toner cartridge in But\nthat's not a printer according\n\n61\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.050\n&gt;&gt; Paper comes out.\n\n62\n00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.780\nPaper comes out and there's stuff on it.\n\n63\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.800\nThat's your idea of a printer.\n\n64\n00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.682\nWrong.\n\n65\n00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:05.120\nAccording to Microsoft,\na printer is what they produce, and\n\n66\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.470\nwhat does Microsoft typically produce?\n\n67\n00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.240\nSoftware.\n\n68\n00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they've been in that business for\na very long time.\n\n69\n00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.170\nIt wasn't until the surface came\nout that they even jumped on that\n\n70\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.600\nmanufacturing bandwagon.\n\n71\n00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.653\nThey've been in software, so\na printer is software, it's not hardware.\n\n72\n00:03:18.653 --> 00:03:21.065\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's software.\nAnd when you go into Windows, and\n\n73\n00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:26.046\nyou go to printers, and I think it's\nother things, cuz they change the names\n\n74\n00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:31.620\noftentimes of these screens that come up,\nand this is where you would add a printer.\n\n75\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.941\nAnd what you're effectively doing,\n\n76\n00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:37.865\nis adding software that communicates\nwith the printer, okay?\n\n77\n00:03:37.865 --> 00:03:41.190\nSo Microsoft doesn't say you're adding\nsoftware that communicates with\n\n78\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.080\nthe printer.\n\n79\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.670\nThey say you're installing a printer.\n\n80\n00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.888\n&gt;&gt; That communicates from\nthe computer to the print device.\n\n81\n00:03:46.888 --> 00:03:47.987\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n82\n00:03:47.987 --> 00:03:48.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n83\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.900\n&gt;&gt; Print device.\n\n84\n00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.454\n&gt;&gt; So your new terminology when we are\ntalking physical, is printing device or\n\n85\n00:03:54.454 --> 00:03:58.025\nprinter device,and when we're\ntalking about a printer-\n\n86\n00:03:58.025 --> 00:03:59.247\n&gt;&gt; No one's going to shoot you for\n\n87\n00:03:59.247 --> 00:04:00.720\nsaying it interchangeably.\n\n88\n00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.690\nYou know, I say it all the time\nanyway to say printer.\n\n89\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.660\nPeople can read in between\nthe lines with that one.\n\n90\n00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.860\n&gt;&gt; You don't say,\ngo to the printing device and\n\n91\n00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.540\npull out that paper I just printed,\nobviously.\n\n92\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.408\nBut when you're taking a Microsoft exam,\nthat's exactly what you do.\n\n93\n00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:20.960\nSo, we're gonna talk about terminology,\nand\n\n94\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.820\nwe're gonna go through the MSDN to\ngive you a broad overview of it.\n\n95\n00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.320\nBasically your coach, your instructor,\nwill explain how you get an account,\n\n96\n00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.130\nbecause they're gonna establish your\naccount through your email address.\n\n97\n00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.303\nSo you're gonna get an email\nthat is somewhat challenging.\n\n98\n00:04:38.303 --> 00:04:41.053\nYou may need your coaches help\nrelative to signing up and\n\n99\n00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:42.700\ngetting access to the software.\n\n100\n00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.010\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, you sent it to me so we\ncould demo it, and it seems pretty easy.\n\n101\n00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.610\nIf you guys are already here,\nI have faith in you.\n\n102\n00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.860\nYou're definitely gonna be\nable to figure that out.\n\n103\n00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.477\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\nWell it's been a while since I signed\n\n104\n00:04:52.477 --> 00:04:53.038\non to that site.\n\n105\n00:04:53.038 --> 00:04:56.010\nIt may have gotten better over the years.\n\n106\n00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.050\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n107\n00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.680\nThat's basically it for\nthis particular module.\n\n108\n00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're just kind of introducing\nyou to what we're gonna be covering\n\n109\n00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.970\nhere in the next couple of episodes here,\nso don't go anywhere.\n\n110\n00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.410\nWe definitely have some cool\ninformation headed your way, and\n\n111\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.050\nwe'll take advantage of\nSteve's knowledge there.\n\n112\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.350\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nthis particular segment, but\n\n113\n00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.670\nwe will see you rather quickly.\n\n114\n00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.370\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n115\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.410\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n116\n00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.250\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at Cyberpatriot.\n\n117\n00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.629\n[MUSIC]\n\n118\n00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.414\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

--> 00:00:23.880\ncover some Windows version history.\n\n9\n00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.440\nHere with us, we have our guru,\nour expert, our historian,\n\n10\n00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.156\nProfessor Steve Linthicum.\n\n11\n00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:31.032\nThank you for coming today, Steve.\n\n12\n00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:31.817\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n13\n00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:33.888\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:36.521\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm gonna be the historian, and\n\n15\n00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:40.704\npart of it stems from the fact that\nI first became acquainted with\n\n16\n00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:43.270\npersonal computers back in 1981.\n\n17\n00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.534\nWhich happens to be at the time that the\nIBM PC was first available for public use.\n\n18\n00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:53.776\nAnd I was actually involved\nin it before then.\n\n19\n00:00:53.776 --> 00:00:59.499\nI go back to my college days and we used\nto program using IBM key punch cards and\n\n20\n00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:05.240\nthen, well, there were a bunch of\nweird sorta not too useful computers.\n\n21\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.200\nThere was the Tandy.\n\n22\n00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.854\nThey had a computer,\nand I had one of those.\n\n23\n00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:16.310\nAnd I had a Cromemco, which actually\nused an operating system pre-DOS.\n\n24\n00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.080\nAnd it was kind of a personal computer,\nbut it had these eight inch floppies.\n\n25\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.540\nAnd it was a challenge.\n\n26\n00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.730\nBut it was better than using a typewriter,\nI guess, to produce documents and stuff.\n\n27\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.320\nSo let's go to this first slide, because\nwe're gonna go through and look at dates.\n\n28\n00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.980\nYou can see up here on the first\nbulleted item that they indicate that\n\n29\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.182\nMS-DOS was issued in 1981 by Microsoft.\n\n30\n00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:45.339\nAnd that was really\nthe first personal computer,\n\n31\n00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:50.310\ntrue personal computer functional while\nin office sort of Operating System.\n\n32\n00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.507\nAlthough, they were competing at that time\nwith other competitors, but typically\n\n33\n00:01:56.507 --> 00:02:02.807\nduring this period of time you were using\ndedicated word processors for office work.\n\n34\n00:02:02.807 --> 00:02:06.500\nIt might be a Wang, or\nsome other manufacturer.\n\n35\n00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.550\nSo, MS-DOS came out in\nconjunction with the IBM PC.\n\n36\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.370\nAnd IBM, fortunately I think, in looking\nat it from a historical standpoint,\n\n37\n00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.230\nthey didn't make their machine,\ntheir IBM PC,\n\n38\n00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.950\nso that you couldn't copy it as\na result of copyright or patents.\n\n39\n00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.520\nSo a bunch of manufacturers\ncame out with IBM clones, so\n\n40\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.100\nthey were fairly commonplace.\n\n41\n00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.470\nAnd we were all using DOS,\njust DOS for a number of years,\n\n42\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.710\nbasically about ten or eleven years.\n\n43\n00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.940\nAnd there was programs where\nyou could download them.\n\n44\n00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.650\nAnd eventually in, I think it was in 1992,\n\n45\n00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.860\nMicrosoft came out with a DOS GUI overlay.\n\n46\n00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.320\nIt laid on top of DOS and\nyou saw Windows 1,\n\n47\n00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.675\nthat never hit the market\non an earlier slide.\n\n48\n00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:59.740\nAnd Windows 2 didn't hit the market\nas a product that you could purchase.\n\n49\n00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.420\nBut ultimately,\nWindows 3.1 was the first real\n\n50\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.210\nWindows product that actually\nworked in an office environment.\n\n51\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.070\nAnd it was pretty good.\n\n52\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.830\nIt was widely adopted\nfrom '92 to late '94.\n\n53\n00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.800\nAnd in late 1994,\nMicrosoft came out with Windows 95.\n\n54\n00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.980\nEverybody loved it and it was truly\na great operating system for its time.\n\n55\n00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.920\nAnd offices widely adopted it,\nvery quickly adopted it.\n\n56\n00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.720\nThey had Windows 95, they had a second\nversion of it that updated it,\n\n57\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.658\nmade it even more powerful.\n\n58\n00:03:39.658 --> 00:03:44.510\nAnd at or about a time of Windows\n95 when it was first issued,\n\n59\n00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.018\nBill Gates who was the Chief Executive\nOfficer, the President of Microsoft,\n\n60\n00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:52.540\nsaw or\nsensed this thing called the Internet.\n\n61\n00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.030\nAnd prior to him making\nthis marvelous discovery,\n\n62\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.230\nMicrosoft had its own communication\nprotocol which meant it could\n\n63\n00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.905\neasily communicate with\nother Windows machines.\n\n64\n00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:05.340\nAt about the same time there,\nwere other companies out there,\n\n65\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.160\nlike Novell, that had their own\nproprietary communication mechanism, and\n\n66\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.480\nwe call that a communication protocol.\n\n67\n00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.861\nYou'll hear protocol used a lot.\n\n68\n00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:18.257\nBut it could communicate\nwith other netwear devices.\n\n69\n00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:22.007\nAnd Bill Gates look out at the Internet,\n\n70\n00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:27.636\nwhich uses TCP/IP,\nthat's its communication protocol,\n\n71\n00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:32.490\nand decided in a very smart\nmanner to adapt TCP/IP as\n\n72\n00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.346\nthe native protocol that\nMicrosoft would utilize in\n\n73\n00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:43.320\nWindows from about,\nI'd say, 1996 on to today.\n\n74\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.110\nAnd that adoption was critical\nto the growth of Windows.\n\n75\n00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.717\nAnd basically the failure to promptly\nadopt by Novell resulted in that\n\n76\n00:04:52.717 --> 00:04:55.851\ncompany not really being\naround much anymore.\n\n77\n00:04:55.851 --> 00:04:57.102\n&gt;&gt; Not as popular.\n\n78\n00:04:57.102 --> 00:05:01.376\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, they controlled the network\nenvironment, Microsoft did not.\n\n79\n00:05:01.376 --> 00:05:05.970\nMicrosoft, at or about I'd say '96,\n\n80\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.105\nthey came out with the Windows Server 3.5.\n\n81\n00:05:11.105 --> 00:05:12.460\nAlthough they changed it.\n\n82\n00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.960\nIt was Windows 3.5 Server.\n\n83\n00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.260\nWe'll see that they changed that.\n\n84\n00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.980\nI'll switch over when we get to about I\nthink it's 2003 where we changed how we-\n\n85\n00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.598\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\n\n86\n00:05:23.598 --> 00:05:26.036\nsometimes don't try to figure out\nMicrosoft's naming convention.\n\n87\n00:05:26.036 --> 00:05:29.301\nI'm not even sure if\nBill Gates knows sometimes,\n\n88\n00:05:29.301 --> 00:05:32.410\nand you'll see Microsoft\nis also notorious.\n\n89\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.860\nI think you mentioned this in an earlier\nepisode, they'll take a little of the same\n\n90\n00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.020\ntechnologies, and\nkind of repackage it like a car.\n\n91\n00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.910\nMaybe slap a new paint of coat on it, but\nunder the hood, it's the same technology,\n\n92\n00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.370\njust in a different spot or\ncalled something different.\n\n93\n00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.500\nSo just be aware of that when\nwe're talking about different\n\n94\n00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.100\noperating systems here.\n\n95\n00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.100\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nwhat happened after Windows 95,\n\n96\n00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.440\nMicrosoft came out with\nWindows 98 in about 1998.\n\n97\n00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.230\nMakes sense, tie out with the date.\n\n98\n00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.080\nAnd it was much better,\nmuch better in terms of networking\n\n99\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.465\ncapabilities primarily and\nit was a true 32 bit operating system.\n\n100\n00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:15.785\nWindows 95 is kinda that\nbridge between DOS,\n\n101\n00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:21.255\nwhich is incidentally a 16\nbit operating system, and\n\n102\n00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:24.995\nWindows 95 was 16 bit, 32 bit,\nkinda had a mixture of code.\n\n103\n00:06:24.995 --> 00:06:30.655\nAnd Windows 98 became a true\n32-bit Operating System.\n\n104\n00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:31.837\nI'm telling you this and\n\n105\n00:06:31.837 --> 00:06:35.495\nlet me see if I can explain a little bit\nof the difference that's instrumental\n\n106\n00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:38.995\nrelative to your decisions on\nthe operating system you're using today.\n\n107\n00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:41.918\nWith 32-bit Operating Systems,\n\n108\n00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:47.770\nyou're limited in amount of RAM that\nthat Operating System can address.\n\n109\n00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:53.244\nAnd it can only address about three and\na half gigs of memory.\n\n110\n00:06:53.244 --> 00:06:59.934\nAnd with 64-bit, which will be\nthe next step they were coming up to,\n\n111\n00:06:59.934 --> 00:07:07.098\nthey can address a sizable level of RAM,\nmore than you'll ever need today.\n\n112\n00:07:07.098 --> 00:07:10.466\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And, Professor Linthicum,\n\n113\n00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:15.302\ncould you also explain where that x86,\nI think it would be perfect to see\n\n114\n00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:19.570\nhow that ties into x86 and 32 bit there-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n115\n00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.049\n&gt;&gt; The processor-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah, well,\n\n116\n00:07:22.049 --> 00:07:24.678\nwe call things their wrong name, okay?\n\n117\n00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:26.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthey kinda have that historical name.\n\n118\n00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.920\nLike I said, you'll learn in Microsoft\nland, it's a little different.\n\n119\n00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.373\nAnd so you see that historical name\nsometimes being used interchangeably with\n\n120\n00:07:34.373 --> 00:07:36.202\n32-bit when you have x86.\n\n121\n00:07:36.202 --> 00:07:36.944\n&gt;&gt; Right, x86,\n\n122\n00:07:36.944 --> 00:07:40.244\nwhich is a fairly high number when\nyou're counting from one to a hundred.\n\n123\n00:07:40.244 --> 00:07:42.578\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you would think that, and\n\n124\n00:07:42.578 --> 00:07:47.566\nthat's how we define oftentimes\nthe 32-bit operating system as an x86.\n\n125\n00:07:47.566 --> 00:07:51.584\nAnd then we get to\nthe 64-bit operating system.\n\n126\n00:07:51.584 --> 00:07:54.266\nSo why don't you tell them\nwhat we define the 64-bit as?\n\n127\n00:07:54.266 --> 00:07:54.800\n&gt;&gt; This one's easy.\n\n128\n00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.834\nSure, I can do that.\n\n129\n00:07:55.834 --> 00:07:57.319\nIt's x64.\n\n130\n00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:58.949\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so\n\n131\n00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:04.551\njust because you have a higher\nnumber doesn't mean you're better.\n\n132\n00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:09.480\nToday, when you're out buying a computer\nyou're not gonna buy a 32-bit machine.\n\n133\n00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.829\nSimply because having that limited\namount of RAM is problematic.\n\n134\n00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:19.120\nAnd there are other restrictions\nassociated with 32-bit operating systems.\n\n135\n00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.230\nBut it's really important that\nwhen you're out buying a hardware,\n\n136\n00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.100\na piece of hardware today,\nthat it's 64 bit as opposed to 32.\n\n137\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:34.262\nSo going back to the history, we had,\non the workstation side, we had Windows.\n\n138\n00:08:34.262 --> 00:08:39.856\nAt the 95 level, we had server 3.5 or\n3.51, ultimately.\n\n139\n00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:44.080\nAnd 3.51 started to get\nreally adopted by businesses.\n\n140\n00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.479\nAnd then we get to Windows 98.\n\n141\n00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:50.159\nAnd we have Windows 98 and\nwe kinda stuck with\n\n142\n00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:55.180\nthe 3.51 as the server operating system.\n\n143\n00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.782\nThen we got to Windows 2000,\nissued and distributed at or\n\n144\n00:08:59.782 --> 00:09:03.156\nabout 2000, maybe a little bit before.\n\n145\n00:09:03.156 --> 00:09:07.130\nSo your workstation\nproduct was Windows 2000.\n\n146\n00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.460\nThe unique thing about Windows 2000 and\nsubsequent workstation and\n\n147\n00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.770\noperating systems is, you had the ability\nto control access to folders and files.\n\n148\n00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.390\nThis was when you could first start,\nbasically,\n\n149\n00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:25.990\ndefining who could get access to folders\nand files on the particular workstation.\n\n150\n00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:30.080\nAnd the interesting thing and\nI don't think I really covered it well.\n\n151\n00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.350\nWhen we talk about 95 and 98 and\ntheir predecessors, we're really more or\n\n152\n00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.970\nless talking about\nstand-alone workstations.\n\n153\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.150\nThey were built not really\nwith networking in mind.\n\n154\n00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.810\nWhen you went to an office in the 90's and\n\n155\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.640\nlooked around,\nevery machine had its own printer.\n\n156\n00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.130\nAnd if I wanted to share a file with you\nI would put a floppy disk in the machine.\n\n157\n00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.230\nI would copy that file over to the floppy\nand I would get out of my chair and\n\n158\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.070\ngo in hand you the floppy disk so\nthat you could have the file.\n\n159\n00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:04.460\nWe called that sneakernet,\nthat's because you're wearing sneakers and\n\n160\n00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.090\nyou get out on your chair and\nyou walk over.\n\n161\n00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:12.880\nSo ultimately we started to see in 95 and\n98 machines starting to get network, but\n\n162\n00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.880\nwe have this issue of security, because\nthe operating system were not capable\n\n163\n00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.440\nof providing a limited access\nto resources on that machine.\n\n164\n00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.080\nSo, we got to 2000 and\nthere was also a product\n\n165\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:35.380\nthat was prior to Windows 2000\non the workstations side,\n\n166\n00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.380\nthere was WindowNT40 workstation.\n\n167\n00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.860\nI didn't talk much about it\nbecause it wasn't widely adopted.\n\n168\n00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.825\n&gt;&gt; I remember an ME also for\n\n169\n00:10:41.825 --> 00:10:44.163\nthe consumer side [CROSSTALK]\nit was millennium edition?\n\n170\n00:10:44.163 --> 00:10:48.071\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to forget that because I\n\n171\n00:10:48.071 --> 00:10:49.380\nused it.\n\n172\n00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.360\nIt was kind of the Vista.\n\n173\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.237\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I agree of that time.\n\n174\n00:10:53.237 --> 00:10:55.110\n&gt;&gt; The Vista of that time.\n\n175\n00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.350\nIt wasn't widely adopted.\n\n176\n00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.050\nAnd there were reasons it\nwasn't widely adopted.\n\n177\n00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.160\nIt wasn't as stable, it had issues, but\n\n178\n00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.000\nit was something that\nMicrosoft pushed out there.\n\n179\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000\nAnd everybody that went to it,\nthat upgraded to it,\n\n180\n00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.970\nupgraded back to Windows\n98 second edition if you.\n\n181\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:18.160\nSo we get to Windows 2000 from\na work station standpoint and\n\n182\n00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.310\nwe also had a companion,\nWindows 2000 server,\n\n183\n00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.440\nthis is really when Microsoft\nstarted getting control of\n\n184\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.890\nthe network environment both from a server\nperspective and a client perspective.\n\n185\n00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:34.079\nWindows 2000 was widely adopted,\npushing Novell out of networks.\n\n186\n00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.119\nAnd they were very effective.\n\n187\n00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:42.319\nThey had, both the workstation and the\nserver had this sort of file structure and\n\n188\n00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:46.230\nfolder structure where you\ncould protect them from access.\n\n189\n00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.800\nYou could define who could get to them,\nwho couldn't get to them.\n\n190\n00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.308\nAnd so we moved from there to Windows XP.\n\n191\n00:11:54.308 --> 00:11:58.200\nAnd that was, and\nthe next one, widely adopted.\n\n192\n00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.150\nAs a matter of fact it was hard-\n&gt;&gt; People loved it.\n\n193\n00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.480\nAnd it was a very long running\noperating system as well.\n\n194\n00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.260\n&gt;&gt; Why switch?\n\n195\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.120\nIt worked.\nIt did everything you wanted to do.\n\n196\n00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.747\nIf it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\n197\n00:12:07.747 --> 00:12:09.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's take a look at your slide.\n\n198\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.680\nYou have some good specifications there.\n\n199\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.910\nAnd also guys,\nyou have these slides from your coaches.\n\n200\n00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.113\nBut, I did, actually if we could hop over\nto my slide real quick or my computer.\n\n201\n00:12:20.113 --> 00:12:24.050\nI wanna show you one other resource\nthat you do have available.\n\n202\n00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.320\nMicrosoft TechNet is a plethora\n\n203\n00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.400\nof information that Microsoft\nwill go ahead and give you.\n\n204\n00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.787\nYou can look up versions here as well, if\nthere's one that we might not have really\n\n205\n00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:37.729\ncovered here,\ntake advantage of Microsoft TechNet.\n\n206\n00:12:37.729 --> 00:12:38.601\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n207\n00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:40.228\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, if we look at Steve's slides,\n\n208\n00:12:40.228 --> 00:12:43.620\nthere's some really good information that\nyou guys can take a look at there as well.\n\n209\n00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.636\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we go through and XP,\n\n210\n00:12:46.636 --> 00:12:51.278\nthey indicate a release date here of 2001.\n\n211\n00:12:51.278 --> 00:12:52.760\nSo really 2000.\n\n212\n00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.660\nThe workstation version wasn't\nall that widely adopted.\n\n213\n00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.580\nBut companies moved over in groves.\n\n214\n00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.444\nPeople, individuals, moved to XP and\nit was a beloved operating system.\n\n215\n00:13:03.444 --> 00:13:07.066\nAs a matter of fact, the only reason\npeople moved away from it, ultimately,\n\n216\n00:13:07.066 --> 00:13:08.920\nwas Microsoft stopped supporting it.\n\n217\n00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.410\nThey forced you often.\n\n218\n00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:15.850\nEven at the time, companies and\npeople went kicking and\n\n219\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.180\nscreaming away from there.\n\n220\n00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.529\nAnd so, it was issued in 2001,\nthe server side was server 2003.\n\n221\n00:13:22.529 --> 00:13:27.170\nNotice that we're changing the name here,\nwe put server before the date.\n\n222\n00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.100\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and so that's a pretty common.\n\n223\n00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:29.833\nThey stuck with that.\n\n224\n00:13:29.833 --> 00:13:32.432\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, they've continued with it.\n\n225\n00:13:32.432 --> 00:13:33.730\n&gt;&gt; Continued, yeah.\n\n226\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.790\n&gt;&gt; We can't ever say what\nMicrosoft's gonna do.\n\n227\n00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:41.767\nGreat operating system, they came out with\na 32-bit version and a 64-bit version.\n\n228\n00:13:41.767 --> 00:13:45.820\nAnd they went through a series of updates.\n\n229\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.633\nIt just was a great operating system and\nI'm sure that you've probably seen it\n\n230\n00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:53.179\nbecause there are older machines out\nthere that they still wanna use it.\n\n231\n00:13:53.179 --> 00:13:57.229\n&gt;&gt; There was one variation of\nthis that I didn't like so\n\n232\n00:13:57.229 --> 00:14:01.845\nmuch at the time that these\nmachines were still being used.\n\n233\n00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.159\nI worked for a computer and\nnetworking repair company and\n\n234\n00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:08.955\nwe would get these media\ncenter editions in here.\n\n235\n00:14:08.955 --> 00:14:14.349\nAnd in addition to the service packs you\nalso had roll ups that it was kind of\n\n236\n00:14:14.349 --> 00:14:19.730\nlike, or Microsoft's first attempt\nat creating a home theater PC.\n\n237\n00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.110\nSo there's a lot of extra work.\n\n238\n00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.915\nAnd here's the thing,\nyou didn't get paid anything extra.\n\n239\n00:14:22.915 --> 00:14:24.246\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n240\n00:14:24.246 --> 00:14:25.597\n&gt;&gt; For those extra steps, so\n\n241\n00:14:25.597 --> 00:14:27.880\nthat wasn't always my favorite there but.\n\n242\n00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:33.350\n&gt;&gt; It truly was a great operating system,\nand so but Microsoft,\n\n243\n00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:38.080\nthe way that they're compensated is\nby you purchasing operating systems.\n\n244\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.670\nAnd so if you've already got Windows XP,\nyou don't want to go out and\n\n245\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.970\nbuy a new operating system, so\nthey discontinued the support,\n\n246\n00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:50.670\nkind of forcing us to go in to a direction\nthat we didn't want to necessarily go in.\n\n247\n00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:56.790\nGood news is that they quit supporting\nit after Windows 7 was issued.\n\n248\n00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:00.350\n&gt;&gt; And so that's great news\nbecause in between XP and\n\n249\n00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.230\nWindows 7,\nthey had this product called Vista.\n\n250\n00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.776\nWhich was kinda like\nthe millennium edition.\n\n251\n00:15:06.776 --> 00:15:11.480\n&gt;&gt; You know,\npeople really met Vista with resistance.\n\n252\n00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.970\nA lot of it was due in part to\nthe invasiveness of the UAC.\n\n253\n00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:22.247\nBut the underlying components\nwere really a historical shift we\n\n254\n00:15:22.247 --> 00:15:25.352\neven see in Microsoft server 2016.\n\n255\n00:15:25.352 --> 00:15:31.790\nA lot of the core components were\nreally noted first with Vista.\n\n256\n00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.478\nSo, people didn't really like it, but\n\n257\n00:15:33.478 --> 00:15:36.025\nthere was a big shift in\nthe underlying architecture there.\n\n258\n00:15:36.025 --> 00:15:37.610\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n259\n00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.665\nAnd, one of the challenges with Vista,\nfrankly, is,\n\n260\n00:15:40.665 --> 00:15:45.215\nwhen you eventually got through to higher\nservice packs it got better and better and\n\n261\n00:15:45.215 --> 00:15:49.650\nthe last service pack that was added to\nVista pretty much made it like Windows 7.\n\n262\n00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:54.031\nAnd it operated pretty good at that point,\nnot so good in the earlier,\n\n263\n00:15:54.031 --> 00:15:57.165\nwithout a service pack or\nafter service pack one.\n\n264\n00:15:57.165 --> 00:16:03.280\nSo ultimately we get to Windows 7 and\nWindows 7 is kind of a Vista.\n\n265\n00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.710\nSo we got good operating system,\nnot so good,\n\n266\n00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.720\nand not really good and wildy adopted one.\n\n267\n00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.799\nIn conjunction with Windows 7,\nthe server product is\n\n268\n00:16:12.799 --> 00:16:16.622\na Windows Server 2008, that's-\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and\n\n269\n00:16:16.622 --> 00:16:20.590\nthen R2 for the revision or release two.\n\n270\n00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:21.340\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You'll\n\n271\n00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.910\nhear that also with-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n272\n00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.440\n&gt;&gt; 2012.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n273\n00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.061\n&gt;&gt; And hopefully, who knows,\nprobably with 2016.\n\n274\n00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:30.577\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, we go through and\n\n275\n00:16:30.577 --> 00:16:35.239\nWindows, the newest, seven.\n\n276\n00:16:35.239 --> 00:16:37.305\nNot the newest as you'll see.\n\n277\n00:16:37.305 --> 00:16:39.326\nBut it was widely adopted by business and\n\n278\n00:16:39.326 --> 00:16:44.300\nhas been a very effective operating system\nand many businesses still use it today.\n\n279\n00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:52.190\nAnd so we have again,\ntied to it was server 2008.\n\n280\n00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.420\nAnd then we get to the next rendition.\n\n281\n00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.350\nAnd Microsoft comes out and\nthey're following this pattern of\n\n282\n00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.570\ngood operating system, not so\ngood, good, not so good.\n\n283\n00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and, actually, I was just\nthinking that, because, personally,\n\n284\n00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:05.900\nthat's exactly what I did.\n\n285\n00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.064\nI had Windows XP,\nI skipped Vista, went to seven,\n\n286\n00:17:09.064 --> 00:17:12.230\nloved seven just as much as I loved XP.\n\n287\n00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.710\nAnd then here we land with\nWindows 8 which was really.\n\n288\n00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.920\nPeople didn't like it, so they said,\nokay, hold on wait a second.\n\n289\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.730\nJust joking.\n\n290\n00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:24.729\nWe're gonna fix things a little bit and\ncall it 8.1.\n\n291\n00:17:24.729 --> 00:17:29.600\n[LAUGH] So, 8.1 people still\nreally didn't gravitate towards\n\n292\n00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.290\nthat either So\nwe see that kind of pattern going.\n\n293\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.710\nBut it's kind of interesting\nbecause Window 8,\n\n294\n00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.100\nslash 8.1 was really released\nin tandem with server 2012.\n\n295\n00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:44.440\nAnd it was pretty cool because now we had\n\n296\n00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.230\nthe option to be able to take\nour consumer-side machine.\n\n297\n00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:53.332\nAnd install our set tools that would\nallow me to control and configure and\n\n298\n00:17:53.332 --> 00:17:57.439\nmanage my servers from my\nworkstation operating system.\n\n299\n00:17:57.439 --> 00:17:58.335\nSo, that was pretty cool.\n\n300\n00:17:58.335 --> 00:18:00.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was pretty cool but\nnobody liked it.\n\n301\n00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.905\n[LAUGH] And part of it was that,\n\n302\n00:18:03.905 --> 00:18:07.455\nwe got rid of this thing called\nthe start button basically.\n\n303\n00:18:07.455 --> 00:18:09.365\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And its functionality, and\n\n304\n00:18:09.365 --> 00:18:11.855\nby the way we had these square\nlooking things on the keyboard.\n\n305\n00:18:11.855 --> 00:18:16.415\n&gt;&gt; And they changed the name with that\ntoo, at first it was the metro interface.\n\n306\n00:18:16.415 --> 00:18:17.135\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n307\n00:18:17.135 --> 00:18:20.090\n&gt;&gt; The tiles, they changed it a couple\nof times so I'm not really sure.\n\n308\n00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:25.050\nAs of today, what they want you to call\nthat interface, the metro interface.\n\n309\n00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.120\nBut it's with the tiles and\nwe saw that because I think a lot\n\n310\n00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.300\nof devices came out with\nthe touch screen capability.\n\n311\n00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.040\nI could see where they're\ngoing with the concept but\n\n312\n00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.210\npeople were used to and\nfamiliar with their original Windows menu.\n\n313\n00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.412\nAnd they wanted it back.\n\n314\n00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:41.944\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n315\n00:18:41.944 --> 00:18:45.552\nAnd I have a touch screen on my laptop and\nI never touch it.\n\n316\n00:18:45.552 --> 00:18:48.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm a keyboard sort of person\n\n317\n00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.990\nand having all these stuff designed for\n\n318\n00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.220\ntouch just it wasn't me,\nit just wasn't me.\n\n319\n00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.670\nAnd so\nwe're kinda at the end of the history.\n\n320\n00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.160\nWe go to Windows 10.\n\n321\n00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.720\nIt's the most modern operating system.\n\n322\n00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.330\nAnd Microsoft is doing a little bit of\na different thing with this desktop\n\n323\n00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.000\noperating system.\n\n324\n00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.630\nIn that we're not looking for\n11, or we're not looking for 12.\n\n325\n00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.230\nWhat we're looking for is updates.\n\n326\n00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.760\nAnd they have things like\nthe anniversary edition.\n\n327\n00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.820\nAnd the new edition that's coming out,\nI think in the Spring,\n\n328\n00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.930\nis something called the creative edition.\n\n329\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.810\nBut it's still Windows 10.\n\n330\n00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.690\nAnd the idea is that your\nmachine is automatically updated\n\n331\n00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:31.260\nto these new renditions.\n\n332\n00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.670\nAnd we were talking during the break\nabout how they expect to get paid\n\n333\n00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.600\nrelative to this.\n\n334\n00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.300\nAnd it's a pretty good question.\n\n335\n00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.620\nThat's kind of an unknown but they're\ngetting paid when you buy a new machine.\n\n336\n00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:46.580\nIt's just my machine here, I theoretically\nbought Windows when I first bought\n\n337\n00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.000\nthe machine, yet I didn't pay for 10.\n\n338\n00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.160\nSo kind of interesting, factually.\n\n339\n00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.210\nServer side we're up to server 2016.\n\n340\n00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:55.710\n&gt;&gt; 2016.\nYep.\n\n341\n00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.360\n&gt;&gt; And that's the latest and greatest.\n\n342\n00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:06.530\nSo that kind of gives you an overview\nof the history as it currently exists.\n\n343\n00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.820\n&gt;&gt; I think that about wraps it up for\nthis episode.\n\n344\n00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.470\nWhat we'll do though,\nnow that we've got the back story.\n\n345\n00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.290\nWe'll go ahead in the next episode and\n\n346\n00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:18.390\nlook at some of the basics and\nget familiarized with the layout.\n\n347\n00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.540\nHow about that?\n\n348\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.535\n&gt;&gt; And sorry for\ntaking you back so far in time.\n\n349\n00:20:21.535 --> 00:20:22.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's okay,\n\n350\n00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.930\nwe had a little bit of a time machine.\n\n351\n00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.440\nGoing on here today.\n\n352\n00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.240\nBut I think that does end\nthis particular episode.\n\n353\n00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.690\nSo go ahead and stay tuned, because\nwe've got more content coming your way.\n\n354\n00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.740\nSo for this episode,\nwe'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n355\n00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.220\nAs your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n356\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.560\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Steven Linthicum.\n\n357\n00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.703\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here for\nCyberPatriot.\n\n358\n00:20:40.703 -->

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.910\nWelcome back, cyber patriots,\nto another online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.170\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.240\nIn this particular episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at Windows basics.\n\n7\n00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.140\nWith us today to help us cover this topic,\nis Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n8\n00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.690\nThank you for joining us, Steve.\n\n9\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.500\n&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.\n\n10\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.760\nWe're gonna look at Windows basics and\nit's really going to be basic.\n\n11\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.330\nBecause this is your starting point.\n\n12\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.380\nYou're gonna have to\nbuild on Windows basics,\n\n13\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.830\nbased upon your own experience and\nknowledge in the operating system.\n\n14\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.340\nAnd I know that we probably have\na wide variety of students.\n\n15\n00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.890\nSome of you are quite familiar with\nWindows, some of you may not be so\n\n16\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.990\nfamiliar.\n\n17\n00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.170\nBut this is your opportunity\nto get really familiar.\n\n18\n00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.045\nSo we'll get you a starting point.\n\n19\n00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:55.110\nYou're gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Take the initiative, we go from there.\n\n20\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.880\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n21\n00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.490\nSo let's go to the first slide.\n\n22\n00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.830\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n23\n00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.544\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and that's the Windows basic,\n\n24\n00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:04.369\nand-\n&gt;&gt; The intro.\n\n25\n00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.140\n&gt;&gt; So this is the second section.\n\n26\n00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.730\nAnd I'm not gonna bring up my\nscreen relative to this, but\n\n27\n00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.370\nI will in later slides, so that you\ncan actually see me doing some things.\n\n28\n00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.850\nThese are things that probably\nare known to most of you.\n\n29\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.018\nWe have the recycle bin.\n\n30\n00:01:17.018 --> 00:01:22.330\nSo when you delete a file, or you delete\na folder, it actually gets transferred\n\n31\n00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.430\nto the recycle bin and probably not\na good idea to immediately throw it away.\n\n32\n00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.720\nBecause you get a second chance\nto throw that trash out, and\n\n33\n00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.580\nit's akin to throwing it in\nthe trash truck when it drives by.\n\n34\n00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.140\nIt'll leaves your machine if you want to\ndo that, at this point, it's still there.\n\n35\n00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.835\nYou can bring it back to where it is,\nby right-clicking on\n\n36\n00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:48.490\nthe trash bin and\nrestoring it to it's original location.\n\n37\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.180\nOr, you can throw it\ninto the garbage truck.\n\n38\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.390\nAnd again, I don't encourage doing that,\nunless you have security reasons,\n\n39\n00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.910\nperhaps, for doing it.\n\n40\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.330\nOr you just get tired of\nseeing that trash can full.\n\n41\n00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.212\n&gt;&gt; If you're really sure, yeah.\n\n42\n00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:05.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so I wouldn't\nimmediately be throwing stuff out.\n\n43\n00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.210\nAnd then we have icons and shortcuts.\n\n44\n00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.220\nThese are on your desktop.\n\n45\n00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.870\nThey're different,\nshortcuts have a little pointer on them,\n\n46\n00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.970\nand they're actually a pointer to an\napplication somewhere on your hard drive.\n\n47\n00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.570\nThe ones that are without\nthe pointers are files\n\n48\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.948\nthat are located actually on your desktop.\n\n49\n00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:31.485\nAnd, I try to keep it clean,\nbecause there are advantages to\n\n50\n00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:34.750\nperformance relative to not keeping\na lot of stuff on your desktop.\n\n51\n00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.105\nBesides, it looks better,\nit's like having a clean room.\n\n52\n00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:39.254\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Versus a not so clean room.\n\n53\n00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:41.060\n&gt;&gt; You dont want to see my PC, [LAUGH].\n\n54\n00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.297\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.\n\n55\n00:02:42.297 --> 00:02:46.630\nYou'll see mine, and I have some\nup there that I frequently go to.\n\n56\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.790\nThat's a good reason for\nhaving them up there.\n\n57\n00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.100\n&gt;&gt; I normally dump things onto my\ndesktop if I'm working on them, and\n\n58\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.740\nit's like a temporary kind of thing.\n\n59\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.690\nAnd I plan to plan to get rid of it,\nor organize it, afterwards.\n\n60\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.235\nBut then you gotta stick with it and\nactually do that, right?\n\n61\n00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:02.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm not that disciplined.\n\n62\n00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.480\nSo, if I put everything that I was working\non, on my desktop, it would be a mess.\n\n63\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.830\n&gt;&gt; Gosh.\nAnd now that I'm using a MacBook here,\n\n64\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.050\nyou can have multiple desktops.\n\n65\n00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.170\nAnd my gosh,\nlet's not even think about that, [LAUGH].\n\n66\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.190\n&gt;&gt; Well, and a recent discovery for me,\n\n67\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.366\nis that you can actually\nhave that on Windows 10.\n\n68\n00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:20.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, I don't use it, because-\n\n69\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.570\n&gt;&gt; I never did either.\n\n70\n00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.330\n&gt;&gt; All I need is two places to put trash,\nright?\n\n71\n00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or trash up a desktop.\n\n72\n00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.780\nSo then we have the Start button.\n\n73\n00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.515\nAnd we talked in the last\nepisode about Microsoft,\n\n74\n00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:34.860\nin its infinite wisdom,\nremoving that Start button.\n\n75\n00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.700\nAnd that turned out to be a bad idea,\n\n76\n00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.750\nbecause people like me are used to getting\nto programs by utilizing the start button.\n\n77\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.518\nAnd it has a left-click and a right-click.\n\n78\n00:03:44.518 --> 00:03:47.740\nAnd that right-click provides\na lot of other capabilities,\n\n79\n00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.830\nthat would typically take you\nmultiple clicks to get to.\n\n80\n00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.666\niView in Windows, there's so\nmany ways to get to so many things,\n\n81\n00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:56.413\nthat the one that has the least\namount of clicks is my favorite.\n\n82\n00:03:56.413 --> 00:04:00.170\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's something you're\ngonna learn from practicing it.\n\n83\n00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.810\nThere's really no better\nway to actually learn that.\n\n84\n00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.525\nYou're gonna learn tricks that\nhelp you become more efficient and\n\n85\n00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:07.680\nfamiliarized with that operating system.\n\n86\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.030\nAnd you learn by doing it, so.\n\n87\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a perfect example of the least\namount of clicks is why I have GodMode\n\n88\n00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.080\non my machine.\n\n89\n00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.500\nBecause, typically the way\nthat you'll go through and\n\n90\n00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.510\nyou make configuration changes,\nis that you gonna click the start button.\n\n91\n00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.642\nYou gonna either type in control panel, or\nif you're in Windows 7, you can actually,\n\n92\n00:04:24.642 --> 00:04:28.700\nthere's a place where you can click and\nget right into the control panel.\n\n93\n00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.553\nAnd we'll be talking more throughout-\n&gt;&gt; I like their run line too.\n\n94\n00:04:32.553 --> 00:04:33.961\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; There are a lot of shortcuts you can\n\n95\n00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:35.950\nuse in the run line,\nyou guys can Google them.\n\n96\n00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.150\nKeyboard shortcuts for\ndifferent operating systems,\n\n97\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.920\nif you haven't looked that up,\ndefinitely do that, [LAUGH].\n\n98\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like copy and paste.\n\n99\n00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.850\nCopy to me is Ctrl+C.\n\n100\n00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.410\nAnd paste is Ctrl+V.\n\n101\n00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.180\nI seldom do it any other way,\nbecause I am a keyboard sorta guy.\n\n102\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.010\nAnd that's the old way that we used to\ndo it back in the earlier Windows days,\n\n103\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.855\nand even programs outside of Windows,\nlike WordStar.\n\n104\n00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:05.540\nThere's a way that you would\nbold using a key combination.\n\n105\n00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.890\nThe start of a bold and an end.\n\n106\n00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.150\nSo, there are a lot of\nkeyboard shortcuts that,\n\n107\n00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.610\nas you get more experience,\nyou'll probably be using, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.530\n&gt;&gt; There was one more bullet here,\nand it's definitely worth mentioning.\n\n109\n00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.340\nIt was the task bar on this slide.\n\n110\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.200\nSo, if we see at that horizontal\nbar at the bottom of your screen,\n\n111\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.060\nwhich can be moved to the right, top,\nor left-hand side of the screen also.\n\n112\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.821\nBut, that's somewhere where you can\nactually pin applications for easy access,\n\n113\n00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:35.017\nwhich I used all the time in\nthat kind of environment, so\n\n114\n00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:36.864\ndefinitely take a look at that.\n\n115\n00:05:36.864 --> 00:05:41.586\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the ones that you commonly go to,\nyou'll pin to that task bar,\n\n116\n00:05:41.586 --> 00:05:43.630\nit makes a lot of sense.\n\n117\n00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.490\nSo here we go on this next slide,\nthe first\n\n118\n00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.790\nthing that you're seeing up on top is when\nyou would actually hit the Start button.\n\n119\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.520\nAnd what you would sort of see-\n&gt;&gt; Over here.\n\n120\n00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.911\n&gt;&gt; Over here on the left, those are\napplications that you recently utilized.\n\n121\n00:05:56.911 --> 00:06:01.060\nAnd then on the right, are common places\nwhere you might be expected to go.\n\n122\n00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.140\nFor example, the Control Panel.\n\n123\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.540\nTypically in a Windows 7 machine, it was\nthere, and in Windows 10, not so much.\n\n124\n00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.680\nSo you end up having to type\ncontrol panel to get to it,\n\n125\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.310\nunless you reconfigure your machine\nto have it over and available.\n\n126\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.656\nAnd then that thing down below, we were\ntalking about, what was the metro or?\n\n127\n00:06:22.656 --> 00:06:24.890\n&gt;&gt; The metro interface, yeah.\n\n128\n00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's that thing.\n\n129\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.070\n&gt;&gt; The metro tiles.\n\n130\n00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n131\n00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.160\n&gt;&gt; The live tiles.\n\n132\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they weren't, yeah,\n&gt;&gt; Right here, down at the bottom.\n\n133\n00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.890\nAnd even here on the slide, it shows.\n\n134\n00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.448\nSo just remember that when Windows\n8.1 brought back that Start button,\n\n135\n00:06:37.448 --> 00:06:40.678\npeople were kind of like revolting,\nwhere did our Start button go?\n\n136\n00:06:40.678 --> 00:06:44.496\nSo that's why we see that quick release\nof the newer version for Windows 8,\n\n137\n00:06:44.496 --> 00:06:46.590\nthe original version released.\n\n138\n00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.922\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I remember, there were you\nknow there's always an application company\n\n139\n00:06:50.922 --> 00:06:53.008\nout there that develops applications.\n\n140\n00:06:53.008 --> 00:06:56.959\nAnd there was one developed by a number\nof software houses that recreated that\n\n141\n00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:59.768\nStart button for you,\nwhen you were using Windows 8.\n\n142\n00:06:59.768 --> 00:07:00.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n143\n00:07:00.492 --> 00:07:04.305\nthe first thing I did when I got on\na Windows 8 Machine, was to create that.\n\n144\n00:07:04.305 --> 00:07:05.130\n&gt;&gt; And that's funny.\n\n145\n00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.380\nSomething you'll notice,\nthat whatever Microsoft does,\n\n146\n00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.410\nthere's usually a company that takes that\nconcept, that technology and expands\n\n147\n00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.270\nupon it as a third party, and really\nfocuses and hones in one that one thing.\n\n148\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.120\nSo, yes a lot is integrated into\nthese operating systems, but\n\n149\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.270\nyou're probably gonna find third\nparty tools that perform the same, or\n\n150\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.404\nsimilar, functions out there as well\n&gt;&gt; And maybe even do it better\n\n151\n00:07:29.404 --> 00:07:30.923\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't wanna say that, but\n\n152\n00:07:30.923 --> 00:07:31.659\nit's the truth.\n\n153\n00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.570\n&gt;&gt; Well I'll say it, okay?\n\n154\n00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.480\nSo one of the things, the next slide\nthat comes up, if you can bring that up.\n\n155\n00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.640\nThis is the file and\nfolder segment in Windows Explorer.\n\n156\n00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.360\nNow, let me explain something.\n\n157\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.090\nMicrosoft tends to overuse words,\nand so with Windows Explorer,\n\n158\n00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.040\nsometimes there's some\nconfusion with people.\n\n159\n00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.330\nSometimes I'll be talking about\nusing Windows Explorer, and\n\n160\n00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.250\nI might be talking about using\nWindows Internet Explorer.\n\n161\n00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.387\nTwo different things.\n\n162\n00:07:59.387 --> 00:08:01.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they sound the same,\nbut they're not.\n\n163\n00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.157\n&gt;&gt; Windows Internet Explorer is\nactually your road to the Internet, or\n\n164\n00:08:06.157 --> 00:08:07.849\nyour pathway to browser.\n\n165\n00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:12.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is an outdated browser,\nit's not supported by Microsoft anymore.\n\n166\n00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.370\nThey, well, they've pushed a new product\non us, and that would be Microsoft Edge.\n\n167\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.150\nSo that's their replacement to\nInternet Explorer, their browser.\n\n168\n00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.299\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n169\n00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:23.041\nI don't know anybody who's using Edge.\n\n170\n00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:29.956\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, you're just,\n[LAUGH] well, yeah.\n\n171\n00:08:29.956 --> 00:08:32.500\nI'll keep my mouth closed on that one.\n\n172\n00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.055\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nlet's switch over to my desktop so\n\n173\n00:08:35.055 --> 00:08:38.940\nthat you can get a live demonstration\nof actually what's going on.\n\n174\n00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.990\nAnd here, what a beautiful scene that is.\n\n175\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.230\nThat's my desktop, notice I don't\nhave an awful lot of icons on it,\n\n176\n00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.400\nbecause I try to keep it as clean\nas possible, but GodMode is there.\n\n177\n00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.030\nAnd what we're gonna do,\nis we're gonna open up a virtual machine.\n\n178\n00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.920\nWeve seen this virtual machine before.\n\n179\n00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.900\nThis is Windows 7, and as we go\nthrough here, one of the things that I\n\n180\n00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.900\nwanted to do is open up a folder,\nopen up Windows Explorer.\n\n181\n00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.580\nI already opened it up, I went to\na specific area on the hard drive,\n\n182\n00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.550\na specific folder.\n\n183\n00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.908\nAnd that's Windows, there's\na subfolder in there called System32.\n\n184\n00:09:13.908 --> 00:09:17.870\nThis is where your operating system,\nan awful lot of the files are located.\n\n185\n00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.560\nAnd one of the challenges that we have is,\n\n186\n00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.070\nMicrosoft wants to protect\nyou against yourself.\n\n187\n00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.641\nI guess, is that a good way to phrase it?\n\n188\n00:09:24.641 --> 00:09:26.127\n&gt;&gt; That's perfect, yes.\n\n189\n00:09:26.127 --> 00:09:27.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n190\n00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.760\nAnd so what they do is,\nthey don't allow you to see everything.\n\n191\n00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.676\nAnd that's okay, unless you need-\n&gt;&gt; They don't think we're ready.\n\n192\n00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.005\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they don't think you're ready.\n\n193\n00:09:38.005 --> 00:09:43.030\nAnd so we believe, we honestly believe,\nthat you are ready to advance to a level\n\n194\n00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.160\nwhere you can see things like hidden\nfolders, stuff they wanna hide from you.\n\n195\n00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.302\nAnd the way you achieve that objective is,\n\n196\n00:09:50.302 --> 00:09:54.675\nyou go into the Control Panel,\nand so I'll look down here.\n\n197\n00:09:54.675 --> 00:09:57.030\nThis is a problem with virtual machines.\n\n198\n00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.050\nYou pick the wrong Start button, okay?\n\n199\n00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.780\nSo I wanna pick this Start button,\nand there is Control Panel.\n\n200\n00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.683\nI have actually picked\nthe one down below it.\n\n201\n00:10:05.683 --> 00:10:09.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which was for my host operating system.\n\n202\n00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.000\nSo I'm gonna click here and\ngo into the Control Panel.\n\n203\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.740\nAnd one of your choices\nhere is Folder Options.\n\n204\n00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.570\nSo I'm gonna click on that guy,\nand bring up Folder Options.\n\n205\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.190\nAnd I'm gonna go over here to View.\n\n206\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.540\nAnd I get a bunch of options here.\n\n207\n00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.800\nAnd I know it's hard\nto see on this screen.\n\n208\n00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.595\nMaybe, if there's some benefit if, I wish\nI could enlarge it so you could kinda see.\n\n209\n00:10:30.595 --> 00:10:32.500\n&gt;&gt; The Windows key plus the + button.\n\n210\n00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nthe Windows key plus the + button.\n\n211\n00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.390\nLet me see if that helps us.\n\n212\n00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.073\nThis may not,\nbecause we're in a virtual machine\n\n213\n00:10:39.073 --> 00:10:39.628\n&gt;&gt; You know what,\n\n214\n00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:41.174\nyou probably lose a lot of those commands.\n\n215\n00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:44.448\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that wasn't really any good.\n\n216\n00:10:44.448 --> 00:10:47.156\nBut as I scroll down,\nI'll try to identify for\n\n217\n00:10:47.156 --> 00:10:50.870\nyou, that which you probably\ncan't see on your screen.\n\n218\n00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.960\nAnd as I bring this down over here,\nwe have two choices.\n\n219\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.115\nThese are what are called radio buttons,\n\n220\n00:10:57.115 --> 00:11:00.625\nmeaning you can push them and it will un-\n&gt;&gt; Change the setting.\n\n221\n00:11:00.625 --> 00:11:02.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, change the setting.\n\n222\n00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.880\nYeah, you basically have two choices here.\n\n223\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.140\nEither that top line,\nright above there, or this bottom line.\n\n224\n00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.960\nAnd the choice is, don't show\nhidden folders, files, or drives.\n\n225\n00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.290\nAnd, we don't want that.\n\n226\n00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:18.450\nWe want it to show these things,\nso I click the show button, okay?\n\n227\n00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.746\nAnd then down below there,\nthere are some choices here.\n\n228\n00:11:21.746 --> 00:11:25.840\nThe next one down below is hide\nempty drives in the computer folder.\n\n229\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.470\nWell, I don't want it to hide anything.\n\n230\n00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:32.230\nSo I'm gonna unclick that one,\nalthough, there may be some issues.\n\n231\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.460\nProbably not.\n\n232\n00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.680\nHide extensions for known file types.\n\n233\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.670\nI wanna uncheck that.\n\n234\n00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.470\nAnd hide protected operating system files.\n\n235\n00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.494\nI'm gonna uncheck that, and\nI'm gonna get this warning saying,\n\n236\n00:11:46.494 --> 00:11:48.228\nare you really sure you wanna do this?\n\n237\n00:11:48.228 --> 00:11:50.010\n&gt;&gt; Is this what you want to do?\n\n238\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.690\n&gt;&gt; And I'm gonna say yes.\n\n239\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.112\nAnd I would encourage you to say yes,\nbecause, we have decided, Cherokee and\n\n240\n00:11:56.112 --> 00:12:00.681\nI have decided, that you are competent to\nget to this level on a virtual machine.\n\n241\n00:12:00.681 --> 00:12:05.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that just means we cant go\naround deleting haphazardly, files now.\n\n242\n00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.090\nBecause that could reduce the overall\nstability of your operating system.\n\n243\n00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.330\nThat's why they hide them originally, so.\n\n244\n00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and here's a clue.\n\n245\n00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:18.050\nGenerally, I'm not sure what apply does,\nso I seldom click it.\n\n246\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.430\nYeah, it would apply it,\ntheoretically, immediately.\n\n247\n00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n248\n00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.240\n&gt;&gt; But if we go over here to OK,\nand we click.\n\n249\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.422\n&gt;&gt; It'll go ahead and\napply that when that windows closes.\n\n250\n00:12:25.422 --> 00:12:27.247\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's applied.\n\n251\n00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:28.547\n&gt;&gt; There goes your zoom now.\n\n252\n00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:29.594\n&gt;&gt; Oops, there goes my zoom.\n\n253\n00:12:29.594 --> 00:12:30.211\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I got zoomed.\n\n254\n00:12:30.211 --> 00:12:31.570\n&gt;&gt; All of a sudden, yep.\n\n255\n00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.170\n&gt;&gt; How did I get zoomed?\n\n256\n00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.448\n&gt;&gt; Maybe when you hit\nthe keys from before?\n\n257\n00:12:35.448 --> 00:12:38.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, well that makes sence.\n\n258\n00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.771\nSo this gives you a sence of how\nyou can get to more files and\n\n259\n00:12:42.771 --> 00:12:46.562\nfolders, that you're\nlikely to need to get to.\n\n260\n00:12:46.562 --> 00:12:51.750\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, once you look at that,\na lot of those file extensions can even.\n\n261\n00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.423\nThey're hidden so that you don't see\nwhat types of files they are, also.\n\n262\n00:12:54.423 --> 00:12:57.838\nSo, understanding the file\nextension can help clue\n\n263\n00:12:57.838 --> 00:13:02.870\nyou in onto how that file should be used,\nwhat program created that file?\n\n264\n00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:07.863\nNow, there are a lot of different\nfile extensions out there.\n\n265\n00:13:07.863 --> 00:13:13.600\nActually, let me go ahead and\nshow you on the slides here.\n\n266\n00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.310\nSo, here we see a list.\n\n267\n00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:19.980\nA very small list, of the available type\nof file extensions that are out there.\n\n268\n00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.410\nJust to get familiar with, at minimum,\n\n269\n00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.610\nthese, but\nknow that there are a lot more out there.\n\n270\n00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.126\nAnd we actually can even look\non Steve's laptop here, and\n\n271\n00:13:29.126 --> 00:13:31.943\nget a real life view of\nwhat's going on [LAUGH].\n\n272\n00:13:31.943 --> 00:13:36.800\nSo, we see our .bat for our batch files,\n.exe very common for executable,\n\n273\n00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.090\nbut what do you got over there, Steve?\n\n274\n00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.333\n&gt;&gt; Some I don't even recognize,\nmy guess would be-\n\n275\n00:13:42.333 --> 00:13:43.135\n&gt;&gt; There are so many, thousands, and\n\n276\n00:13:43.135 --> 00:13:43.651\nthousands out there.\n\n277\n00:13:43.651 --> 00:13:48.565\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are just so many,\nthat you can't, as we go down here,\n\n278\n00:13:48.565 --> 00:13:50.134\nif I can scroll down.\n\n279\n00:13:50.134 --> 00:13:51.040\nI mean there's just a ton.\n\n280\n00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.720\n&gt;&gt; So ones that you definitely, there we\ngo, .sys, what do you think those are for?\n\n281\n00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.310\nWell, System.\n\n282\n00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.114\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because it says System\nover there, the file type.\n\n283\n00:13:59.114 --> 00:14:03.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] System, file type, there you\ngo. &gt;&gt; That was the direct giveaway, okay?\n\n284\n00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.090\n&gt;&gt; Those are ones we definitely\ndon't want to delete or move around.\n\n285\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.669\nSo those are the ones\nthat are normally hidden.\n\n286\n00:14:09.669 --> 00:14:11.720\nOther file types may be hidden, also.\n\n287\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.720\nBut yeah, just get familiar\nwith those file extensions,\n\n288\n00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.720\nbecause it's gonna clue you in\non what kind of file that is.\n\n289\n00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n290\n00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.390\nSo, let me back out of here,\nwhile we're doing-\n\n291\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.910\n&gt;&gt; And let's take a look at my screen,\n\n292\n00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.820\nand there's something else\nwe wanted to note here.\n\n293\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.620\nWe have our Microsoft Windows directory.\n\n294\n00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.945\nAnd what our Directory is,\nis a hierarchical struture,\n\n295\n00:14:34.945 --> 00:14:38.985\nan organization of files\nwithin our operating system.\n\n296\n00:14:38.985 --> 00:14:41.299\nAnd we can go ahead and see that here.\n\n297\n00:14:41.299 --> 00:14:44.635\nOur root here, normally the C drive.\n\n298\n00:14:46.345 --> 00:14:49.960\nThis is where we're gonna go ahead and,\nand it's kind of interesting.\n\n299\n00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.800\nMicrosoft uses back slashes\nin their UNC paths.\n\n300\n00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.192\nYou'll notice,\nwhen you're getting familiar with Linux,\n\n301\n00:14:56.192 --> 00:14:59.320\nand the command line interface, you're\ngonna be using forward slashes there.\n\n302\n00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.990\nTheir file structure is\na little bit different there,\n\n303\n00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.710\nbut that'll be something that\nyou guys will find out for sure.\n\n304\n00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.040\n&gt;&gt; Now, wouldn't it be nice if\neverybody kept everything the same?\n\n305\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.970\n&gt;&gt; Why can't we all just get along?\n\n306\n00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:10.505\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n307\n00:15:10.505 --> 00:15:11.844\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if we go to my screen,\n\n308\n00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:15.910\nand I can kind of give you a real\nlife demonstration of what we have.\n\n309\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.540\nWhen you open up Windows Explorer,\nthis is oftentimes the view you'll get.\n\n310\n00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.000\nThis is the computer view.\n\n311\n00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.390\nAnd as you can see, this is a virtual\nmachine, I have a hard drive.\n\n312\n00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.340\nTheoretically, I have a floppy drive,\nbut I don't really have one and I-\n\n313\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.930\n&gt;&gt; And just note, you said my computer, or\n\n314\n00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:31.990\nyou might have said computer.\n\n315\n00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.490\nBut in the Windows XP, it was my computer,\nand now they call it what?\n\n316\n00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.690\nMy PC, this PC?\n\n317\n00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.590\nSo, it's the same concept,\nlike we talked about earlier.\n\n318\n00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.620\nBut Microsoft's just renaming it, so\n\n319\n00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.270\ndon't get hung up on the small\nlittle details there.\n\n320\n00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.045\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm always hung up on\nthose small little details.\n\n321\n00:15:49.045 --> 00:15:51.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because, I wanna be back in network\n\n322\n00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.090\nneighborhood, which was a number\nof renditions of Windows ago.\n\n323\n00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.828\nAnd I don't know why they changed things,\nbecause, when you bring up the control\n\n324\n00:15:58.828 --> 00:16:02.040\npanel, they're in alphabetical order,\nand they changed the name.\n\n325\n00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:02.590\nAnd guess what?\n\n326\n00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.820\nIt's in a different part\nof the Control Panel.\n\n327\n00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.562\n&gt;&gt; Just to make things interesting,\nthat's all.\n\n328\n00:16:05.562 --> 00:16:07.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\njust to make them interesting for us.\n\n329\n00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.220\nSo here, you can see,\nwe've got the C drive.\n\n330\n00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.738\nIf I click on that guy,\nwe have a number of folders here.\n\n331\n00:16:14.738 --> 00:16:19.011\nAnd in the screenshot that we saw before,\nwe have Program Files.\n\n332\n00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:22.760\nThis is where programs are gonna\nbe loaded in, basically.\n\n333\n00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:29.280\nSo these are folders, the old\nterminology for folders was directories,\n\n334\n00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.320\nand then inside of directories,\nwe would put subdirectories, or files.\n\n335\n00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.950\nWe have to change that terminology since\nwe're to files, because of Microsoft so-\n\n336\n00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:38.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n337\n00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.350\nyou see this hierarchical structure being\nused in so many ways in computer science.\n\n338\n00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:48.940\nAnd, when we have a folder, and\nthere's a folder inside of a folder,\n\n339\n00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.440\nwe see a nested folder, and\nwe have this hierarchical structure.\n\n340\n00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.555\nAnd guess what?\nThey use the same concept for\n\n341\n00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:55.710\nActive Directory.\n\n342\n00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.457\nAnd it goes it all the way down,\nall these subordinate objects, and\n\n343\n00:16:59.457 --> 00:17:01.446\nyou can kind of think of it as a tree.\n\n344\n00:17:01.446 --> 00:17:07.100\nAnd at the very end of those branches, we\nhave leafs, kind of blowing in the wind.\n\n345\n00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.140\nSo files and\n\n346\n00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:14.260\nphotos that have no subordinate objects,\nthose are called leaf objects.\n\n347\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.700\nBut you kind of have to think\nof it in that way, okay?\n\n348\n00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.340\nAnd it's like those tentacles,\nor branches,\n\n349\n00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.382\njust branching out depending\non your nesting scheme.\n\n350\n00:17:23.382 --> 00:17:28.690\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we call that folder that we\nwere looking at that was C, we generally\n\n351\n00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.413\ncall that the root, cuz that's the-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good,\n\n352\n00:17:31.413 --> 00:17:32.958\nit goes with the tree analogy, right?\n\n353\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:37.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you flip the tree, and\nyou got the root in the ground, and\n\n354\n00:17:37.475 --> 00:17:41.281\nthen the trunk,\nwhich is probably those main folders.\n\n355\n00:17:41.281 --> 00:17:43.234\nSo this would be a multi-trunked tree.\n\n356\n00:17:43.234 --> 00:17:47.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That we see at the root of C here.\n\n357\n00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.066\nAnd then inside of that,\n\n358\n00:17:49.066 --> 00:17:53.817\nwe have potentially sub-branches I\nguess I would characterize them as.\n\n359\n00:17:53.817 --> 00:17:57.608\nOr branches, and then below that we\nhave sub-branches, and then ultimately,\n\n360\n00:17:57.608 --> 00:17:59.680\nwe get out there to that leaf object.\n\n361\n00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.295\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and on the slide,\nhere on my computer, you can see,\n\n362\n00:18:03.295 --> 00:18:04.215\nthey give an example.\n\n363\n00:18:04.215 --> 00:18:04.715\nWhat is it?\n\n364\n00:18:04.715 --> 00:18:06.335\nAn iTunes folder.\n\n365\n00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:08.745\nSo let's say I go ahead and\ninstall iTunes.\n\n366\n00:18:08.745 --> 00:18:12.575\nNow, that installation package is\ngoing to generate a folder and\n\n367\n00:18:12.575 --> 00:18:15.650\nmaybe I put my songs, my videos,\nwhatever that I have.\n\n368\n00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:19.390\nIf I go in, and I delete that iTunes\nfolder, do you think that application or\n\n369\n00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.000\nthat piece of software is\ngoing to work properly?\n\n370\n00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.940\nWell, no.\n\n371\n00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.910\nAnd that's why they hide\na lot of these files.\n\n372\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but you're now experts,\n\n373\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.990\nso we're not concerned at all about\nyou having access to those folders.\n\n374\n00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.215\nJust be careful.\n\n375\n00:18:34.215 --> 00:18:37.000\nThat's, I think, the bottom line is,\nsimply be careful.\n\n376\n00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.780\nSo I think-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're good here.\n\n377\n00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.230\nAnd that wraps it up for\nthis particular episode.\n\n378\n00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.300\nBut, stay tuned, we have some\nmore information coming your way.\n\n379\n00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.210\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this particular episode.\n\n380\n00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.746\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n381\n00:18:48.746 --> 00:18:50.740\n&gt;&gt; And I'm professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n382\n00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.714\n&gt;&gt; See you next time,\nhere at Cyber Patriot.\n\n383\n00:18:54.714 --> 00:19:00.463\n[MUSIC]\n\n384\n00:19:00.463 --> 00:19:03.888\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:15.581\n&gt;&gt; Welcome cyber patriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:17.865\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:24.130\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\nlooking at the question what is MSDN?\n\n7\n00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.550\nTo help us figure out\nthis perplexing answer,\n\n8\n00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.350\nwe have Professor Steve Linthicum\nwith us today.\n\n9\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.790\nThank you for joining us, Steve.\n\n10\n00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.660\n&gt;&gt; It's good to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.227\nAnd we're gonna talk about MSDN,\nbut we're gonna kinda forget MSDN,\n\n12\n00:00:36.227 --> 00:00:39.695\nbecause I can never get those\nletters in their proper order.\n\n13\n00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:41.525\nSomething about MSDN.\n\n14\n00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:43.885\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft Developer Network.\n\n15\n00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:47.665\nBut like we said, Microsoft likes to\nchange things up a little bit with their\n\n16\n00:00:47.665 --> 00:00:50.555\nnaming conventions, so\ndon't get hung up on that acronym.\n\n17\n00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:54.565\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and we're gonna talk about another\nchange in their naming convention also.\n\n18\n00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:57.865\nSo basically,\nwe'll start out with this first slide, and\n\n19\n00:00:57.865 --> 00:01:01.645\nit'll help explain what's going on and\nwhy you get this great benefit.\n\n20\n00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:03.600\nAnd it truly is a great benefit.\n\n21\n00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.230\nMicrosoft is a Cyber Diamond\nsponsor of CyberPatriot.\n\n22\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.810\n&gt;&gt; Sounds fancy.\n\n23\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.845\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds really,\n\n24\n00:01:09.845 --> 00:01:14.285\n[LAUGH] It's better than being\na cubic zirconium sponsor.\n\n25\n00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:14.935\n[LAUGH] Okay?\n\n26\n00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:15.585\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n27\n00:01:15.585 --> 00:01:19.775\n&gt;&gt; So, under the sponsorship,\nMicrosoft allows you,\n\n28\n00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:22.810\nyou as a CyberPatriot participant,\nto access and\n\n29\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.390\nuse what they characterize as\ntheir MSDN developer network.\n\n30\n00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.090\nAlso known as DreamSpark but\nno longer known as DreamSpark.\n\n31\n00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.710\nSo, I'll be talking about that.\n\n32\n00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.980\nAnd basically, what is this\n\n33\n00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.690\nproduct allows you to do is to shop\non their store and get software.\n\n34\n00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.220\nAnd normally when you go to a store,\nI don't know about you or me,\n\n35\n00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.270\nbut I always take my wallet with me\nbecause I'm gonna have to pay for stuff.\n\n36\n00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.720\nWell, good news, you don't have to pay for\nstuff through this store.\n\n37\n00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.020\nSo basically, what you're gonna\ndo is have access to download\n\n38\n00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.318\na whole bunch of Microsoft software.\n\n39\n00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:01.600\n&gt;&gt; So incredible.\n\n40\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thousands of dollars of software,\nand use them.\n\n41\n00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.640\nAnd with most of the proxys\nthey reference here,\n\n42\n00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.240\nyou'll get a two year license for use.\n\n43\n00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.380\nSo, and some of them, the license\nfrankly just never expires because\n\n44\n00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.010\nthere's a whole range of products here.\n\n45\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.960\nAnd I love this,\nMSDN is an extremely generous program.\n\n46\n00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.166\nI wonder who wrote that words,\n[LAUGH] those generous program.\n\n47\n00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:26.890\nVery useful and that is true.\n\n48\n00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.770\nAnd it is generous.\n\n49\n00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.290\n&gt;&gt; It is generous, yes.\n\n50\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Because you're getting this at no\ncost to you, and it's really cool.\n\n51\n00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.941\n&gt;&gt; I was telling Steve, I wish I had\nsomething like this when I was younger.\n\n52\n00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:38.870\n[LAUGH] Take advantage of it,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n53\n00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.360\nIt's definitely worth looking at here,\nyeah.\n\n54\n00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.600\n&gt;&gt; And those of you who, for example,\nwanna build your own machine,\n\n55\n00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.970\nbuild your own Windows machine, this is\nthe perfect opportunity for you to do so\n\n56\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.030\nwithout-\n&gt;&gt; Save some money, yeah.\n\n57\n00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, without having to go out and\nbuy Windows 10.\n\n58\n00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.570\nAnd I don't know what the cost of Windows\n10 is, because I've never bought it.\n\n59\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.780\nI've bought machines with in on it.\n\n60\n00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I upgraded during the free period\nthere, so I couldn't give a you a number.\n\n61\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nI'm sure that it is not cheap.\n\n62\n00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.320\nThat we can rest assured of.\n\n63\n00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.229\nSo what we're gonna do is,\nwe have a whole series of\n\n64\n00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.340\nslides down the road in\nthe spring of slides, but\n\n65\n00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.140\nI think it's really better if we talk more\nabout the benefits associated with it.\n\n66\n00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.786\nAnd this whole section four,\nI'm gonna cruise right through it,\n\n67\n00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:27.625\njust-\n&gt;&gt; Do we want to take a look at it?\n\n68\n00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:30.015\nYou know what,\nI have pulled up on my screen.\n\n69\n00:03:30.015 --> 00:03:32.865\n&gt;&gt; But you already logged in,\nso I'm just gonna show them\n\n70\n00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:38.085\nthat there is a methodology that you go\nthrough and with your coaches assistant.\n\n71\n00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:41.665\nAnd these slides are probably not\nrelevant anymore, or as relevant,\n\n72\n00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:45.860\nbecause Microsoft has rebranded\nDreamSpark into something else.\n\n73\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.010\nBut basically,\nyou become eligible by registering.\n\n74\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.360\nAnd your coach will help you\nwith that registration process.\n\n75\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.480\nYou activate your account, and up pops,\n\n76\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.808\nafter you've logged in, your gonna get on\nthe MSDN, which in no longer MSDN site.\n\n77\n00:04:04.808 --> 00:04:07.300\nAnd you're gonna go through and\n\n78\n00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.430\nbasically a good time to click away from\nhere and to go on to your machine is\n\n79\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.930\nto show this particular site-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n80\n00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.660\n&gt;&gt; Where you can, quote,\npurchase software.\n\n81\n00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.620\n&gt;&gt; So if we go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen,\n\n82\n00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.100\nwe can see that this particular online\nstore, what do they call it here?\n\n83\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.480\nMicrosoft Imagine X, it looks like.\n\n84\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.260\nBut you can scroll down and just wow.\n\n85\n00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.570\nAnd I'll tell you guys the steps\nthat it shown earlier,\n\n86\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.910\nit seems like there were a lot.\n\n87\n00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.730\nBut I literally, with this demo\naccount that we were logging in here,\n\n88\n00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.300\nit took me all of two minutes\nto complete the registration.\n\n89\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.860\nSo don't worry about that,\nit's definitely not that difficult here.\n\n90\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.540\nBut look at all of these wonderful tools.\n\n91\n00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.070\nThis is so cool.\n\n92\n00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:57.340\nYeah, please, please take advantage of\nthis option that you guys have here.\n\n93\n00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.122\nIt just keeps going.\n\n94\n00:05:00.122 --> 00:05:01.130\nI'm just wow.\n\n95\n00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.770\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing.\n\n96\n00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.148\nThey're just-\n&gt;&gt; Stuff that I've never even heard of,\n\n97\n00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:06.742\nsome of these tools before.\n\n98\n00:05:06.742 --> 00:05:10.840\nApplications, programs to develop\nyour own applications and games.\n\n99\n00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.480\nAnd just SQL databases,\nall sorts of things here, so.\n\n100\n00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.058\n&gt;&gt; And if you'll scroll back to the top-\n&gt;&gt; The very top.\n\n101\n00:05:17.058 --> 00:05:19.752\n&gt;&gt; Because I wanna give\ncredit where credit is due.\n\n102\n00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:24.450\nI'm the, I guess we characterize as\nthe DreamSpark administrator, but\n\n103\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.255\nI'm something new.\n\n104\n00:05:25.255 --> 00:05:31.170\nI'm the Microsoft Image Administrator for\nSierra College's website.\n\n105\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.530\nAll of our students get access,\n\n106\n00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.790\nall of our CIS students that are going\nthrough our program, get this also.\n\n107\n00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.210\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft is pushing\n\n108\n00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.770\nthese line of products, obviously,\n\n109\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.710\nto people who they feel will be involved\nin purchasing them down the road.\n\n110\n00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.870\nAnd that's you, too.\n\n111\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.339\nYou as students, because you're\nbecoming familiar with the Microsoft-\n\n112\n00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:53.353\n&gt;&gt; You get really familiar with them, and\n\n113\n00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:57.627\nyou know what, whenever your employers,\nand you're sitting there in your future\n\n114\n00:05:57.627 --> 00:06:01.562\nroles, and you're having meetings,\nyou can make software suggestions.\n\n115\n00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:04.110\nSo, you,\nthat's a very smart move on their part.\n\n116\n00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.070\n&gt;&gt; So the interesting thing is that site\nis the Sierra site for our students.\n\n117\n00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.900\nAnd what's also interesting is\nthat I created an account so\n\n118\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.950\nthat we could have an example of it here.\n\n119\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.905\nAnd I heard almost immediately,\nwhat if somebody hacking our-\n\n120\n00:06:16.905 --> 00:06:18.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] From your colleagues?\n\n121\n00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes, from my colleagues,\n\n122\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.960\nbecause the announcement went\nout that we had a new user.\n\n123\n00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.360\nI quickly explained that\nI was here in Florida and\n\n124\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.760\nwe were demoing the site for\nthe software that you again,\n\n125\n00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.210\nthey characterized as purchase, but very\ngreat purchase price which is no dollars.\n\n126\n00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.760\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n127\n00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.560\nliterally what you will do is\nyou'll go ahead and purchase.\n\n128\n00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.700\nAnd as you go through the website,\nyou buy it, no cost.\n\n129\n00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.648\nAnd then you get the product code,\nwhat you need to actually register\n\n130\n00:06:50.648 --> 00:06:55.341\nyour software so that you won't\nget that non-genuine message,\n\n131\n00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:58.521\nfor example, for your operating systems.\n\n132\n00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:00.450\nAfter a period of time, it expires.\n\n133\n00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.260\nThis is genuine Microsoft software,\nit is as though you paid for it.\n\n134\n00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.610\nWell, you purchased it,\nyou just paid nothing for it.\n\n135\n00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.460\nSo it's a great, great, great, great perk.\n\n136\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.144\n&gt;&gt; Bonus, yeah.\n\n137\n00:07:13.144 --> 00:07:14.980\nWith this program,\nthe Cyber Patriot program,\n\n138\n00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.840\nyou guys really do have a lot of\ncool tools at your disposal here.\n\n139\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.790\n&gt;&gt; So that pretty well goes\nthrough this segment, I think.\n\n140\n00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we'll go ahead and\nwrap this particular episode up.\n\n141\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.310\nBut we do have a lot more\nturning coming your way.\n\n142\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.930\nSo get comfortable and stay tuned.\n\n143\n00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.910\nBut signing off for this episode,\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n144\n00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.373\n&gt;&gt;

Right, so we're gonna go\nthrough a step-by-step process and\n\n11\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.400\nfacilitate your ability to go through and\ndo this.\n\n12\n00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.711\nThe bottom line here is,\nas we go through here,\n\n13\n00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:46.800\nhopefully you've learned how to\ndownload software from the MSDN site.\n\n14\n00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.330\nWhich is now the ImageX,\nor whatever it is, site.\n\n15\n00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.630\nAnd once you've downloaded,\n\n16\n00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.550\nyou've got a couple of choices relative\nto the software that you've downloaded.\n\n17\n00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.810\nYou can install them inside\na virtual environment.\n\n18\n00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.160\nIn this case, don't use that product code.\n\n19\n00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.060\nCuz what you gonna get\nwhen you download it,\n\n20\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.190\nyou're gonna get a period of time that\nyou can use it, and then it blows up.\n\n21\n00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.500\nIt becomes pretty much unusable.\n\n22\n00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.050\nBut you don't wanna\nwaste that product code,\n\n23\n00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.210\nthe registered version,\ninside this virtual environment.\n\n24\n00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.060\nBecause ultimately, you may want to\nuse it for a machine that you build.\n\n25\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.720\nSo lets go through the process, and\nI'm gonna be doing this on my screen.\n\n26\n00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.134\nFirst thing that you need to do,\nand this is at home.\n\n27\n00:01:28.134 --> 00:01:32.126\nOne of the things you would,\nlet's pretend that you're at home, and\n\n28\n00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:33.630\nyou go out to VMware site.\n\n29\n00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.760\nAnd I give you, based upon that\nsite where I'm collecting stuff,\n\n30\n00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.060\ninstructions on how to get\naccess to VMware Player.\n\n31\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.160\nIt's an application.\n\n32\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.480\nYou download it, and you install it.\n\n33\n00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.820\nAnd once you've completed that process,\nand the installation is real simple.\n\n34\n00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.630\nIt's kinda like Next, Next,\nNext, Next, and Finish.\n\n35\n00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.610\nAnd then you have\nVMWare Player on your machine.\n\n36\n00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.060\nAnd so you will open it up.\n\n37\n00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.500\nAnd this is VMWare player.\n\n38\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.340\nThis is the environment.\n\n39\n00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.110\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're\ncreate a new virtual machine.\n\n40\n00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.270\nThe images that you bring down from\nthe Microsoft site are ISO files.\n\n41\n00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.730\nThat means that they're a snapshot\nof the installation DVD.\n\n42\n00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.172\nAnd so we're gonna pretend,\nas we go through this process,\n\n43\n00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:22.447\nthat that is, in fact, a DVD.\n\n44\n00:02:22.447 --> 00:02:24.460\nAnd you'll see that as we go through here.\n\n45\n00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.550\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do here is\nI'm gonna say Create a Virtual Machine.\n\n46\n00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.640\nAnd I've got to decide what kind of\nvirtual machine that I'm gonna do,\n\n47\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.480\nthat I'm gonna use.\n\n48\n00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.250\nAnd we're gonna use an installation disc.\n\n49\n00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.830\nAnd so we click here, and we have to\nactually go to that installation disc\n\n50\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.370\nwhere it-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n51\n00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.110\nwe're essentially just navigating to the\nlocation where that ISO file is stored.\n\n52\n00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.560\n&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna do another thing, here.\n\n53\n00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.620\nI'm telling it it's gonna be\nan installation disc, but not really.\n\n54\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.202\nI'm gonna install it, basically,\n\n55\n00:02:56.202 --> 00:03:02.590\nput that disc in play once I get\nthe whole environment setup.\n\n56\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.160\nCuz it really is a better way to show you.\n\n57\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.800\nSo I go Next, and this is gonna be\na Microsoft Windows operating system.\n\n58\n00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.850\nAnd I've selected for this purpose.\n\n59\n00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.220\nWe have a whole choice, here.\n\n60\n00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.060\nWe can go to a bunch of servers, here.\n\n61\n00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.376\nAnd I have actually, I think we'll go\nwith the Windows Server 2008 R2 64.\n\n62\n00:03:26.376 --> 00:03:31.335\nNow the reason I'm picking this particular\noperating system is because I wanna\n\n63\n00:03:31.335 --> 00:03:35.998\nmake sure that you understand that this\nwill not work unless your machine,\n\n64\n00:03:35.998 --> 00:03:39.937\nthe machine that we're dong this on,\nis a 64-bit machine.\n\n65\n00:03:39.937 --> 00:03:41.653\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, moving 2012 and forward,\n\n66\n00:03:41.653 --> 00:03:44.987\nthey've stopped making 32-bit\nnetwork-based operating systems.\n\n67\n00:03:44.987 --> 00:03:46.659\nSo something to keep your eye out for.\n\n68\n00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:51.377\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, and so\nwhat you can't do is you can't install\n\n69\n00:03:51.377 --> 00:03:56.202\na 64-bit virtual machine on\na 32-bit physical machine.\n\n70\n00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.153\nIt's one thing-\n&gt;&gt; But you could do it vice versa.\n\n71\n00:03:58.153 --> 00:03:59.581\nSo it's kind of weird in that way.\n\n72\n00:03:59.581 --> 00:04:04.580\nYou could put a 32-bit virtual machine\nwithin a 64-bit physical environment.\n\n73\n00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.220\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so I click here, and\n\n74\n00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.955\nI've identified the operating system\nthat we're going to be doing.\n\n75\n00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:12.760\nSo this is setting up\nthe operating environment.\n\n76\n00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.935\nThe virtual machine name,\nwe'll leave it this.\n\n77\n00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:19.384\nIt's Windows Server 2008 R2 and\n\n78\n00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:24.257\n64, the x64 as opposed to the x86.\n\n79\n00:04:24.257 --> 00:04:26.120\nWe talked about that before.\n\n80\n00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.590\nAnd we would identify where\nwe would want to put that.\n\n81\n00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.890\nThe default is it actually puts it in your\nown personal folder, your User folder,\n\n82\n00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.150\nunder Documents,\nin something called Virtual Machines.\n\n83\n00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.500\nThat's okay for\njust what we're doing here.\n\n84\n00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.770\nI click Next.\n\n85\n00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.620\nWe define how big the hard\ndrive is going to be.\n\n86\n00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.360\nAnd we keep this setting, either of\nthese settings don't really matter.\n\n87\n00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.300\nDepending upon whether you\nwere moving this or not, but\n\n88\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.830\nwe'll leave it at 40 gigs.\n\n89\n00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.970\nNow the good news is that it is\nnot going to take up 40 gigs.\n\n90\n00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.026\nIt is going to take up whatever\nit needs to take up, but\n\n91\n00:05:02.026 --> 00:05:04.471\nwill never expand beyond 40.\n\n92\n00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.818\nThe reason why that's great is because\nyou could fill up your drive pretty fast\n\n93\n00:05:07.818 --> 00:05:10.009\nwith a bunch of these\n40-gig virtual machines.\n\n94\n00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.067\n&gt;&gt; They were static versus that dynamic-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n95\n00:05:13.067 --> 00:05:19.040\nit's a dynamic sort of arrangement,\nand then I click Finish.\n\n96\n00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.800\nSo now we've got our environment.\n\n97\n00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.150\nBut the challenge that I'm facing is I\nneed to point to that installation disc.\n\n98\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.730\nAnd so I go in here, and I edit\nthe settings, edit the machine settings.\n\n99\n00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.166\nAnd the default for this machine,\nif you can see here, right over here,\n\n100\n00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:38.725\nis how much RAM I'm giving this machine.\n\n101\n00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:40.190\n&gt;&gt; And\nthis is good that you are showing this.\n\n102\n00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.957\nBecause something we really didn't\ntalk too much about would be system\n\n103\n00:05:42.957 --> 00:05:43.610\nrequirements.\n\n104\n00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.540\nAnd we're talking hardware requirements\nwhen we were talking about virtualization.\n\n105\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.140\nBecause you have to add up all\nof the system requirements.\n\n106\n00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.770\nLet's say that I wanted to go ahead,\nand I had my host operating system.\n\n107\n00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.100\nAnd I wanted to create\nfive virtual machines.\n\n108\n00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.900\nWell, depending on the operating system,\nI would need to do a little research,\n\n109\n00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.230\nyou can find them on the manufacturers\npage, for the system requirements.\n\n110\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.810\nHow much memory does XP need?\n\n111\n00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.020\nHow much memory does Server 2016 need?\n\n112\n00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.454\nWell, you add it all up.\n\n113\n00:06:09.454 --> 00:06:13.512\nAnd you need to make sure that your\nphysical machine can actually cover\n\n114\n00:06:13.512 --> 00:06:17.844\nthe amount for itself, the host operating\nsystem, in addition to all your\n\n115\n00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:21.520\nother virtual machines that you\nmight wanna be running there.\n\n116\n00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.450\nSo now is where we see Steve having that\noption to choose how much RAM he wants\n\n117\n00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.640\nto assign to this particular machine.\n\n118\n00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.968\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nhow can I say this without being?\n\n119\n00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:34.931\nWell, I'll just say it.\n\n120\n00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:36.359\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Oftentimes,\n\n121\n00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:40.898\nwhat Microsoft does is that\nthey give you the requirements.\n\n122\n00:06:40.898 --> 00:06:44.473\nAnd the requirement are the bare,\nbare minimums.\n\n123\n00:06:44.473 --> 00:06:48.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what do they even say for\nHyper-V, for the requirements?\n\n124\n00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.420\nI wanna say, man, it's something\nlike two or four gigs of RAM.\n\n125\n00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.140\nBut it's so low, I think it's four gigs.\n\n126\n00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.270\nI would never recommend that, to try\nto run a virtual environment with only\n\n127\n00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.220\nfour gigs of RAM on your physical machine.\n\n128\n00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.079\nYou, aah, yeah, no.\n\n129\n00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:05.895\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The good news is is that\n\n130\n00:07:05.895 --> 00:07:09.233\nthis an adjustment that you can make later\non, also, in this virtual environment.\n\n131\n00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:12.000\n&gt;&gt; And\nvirtual machines love the hardware memory.\n\n132\n00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.098\nThe more memory you can afford,\n\n133\n00:07:13.098 --> 00:07:16.550\nthat's really where you're gonna be where\nyou see the biggest improvement, there.\n\n134\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.863\nOne thing though, if you do keep it,\n\n135\n00:07:17.863 --> 00:07:22.820\nand you'll need to play around with these\nnumbers, also, depending on your machines.\n\n136\n00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.430\nIf during the installation portion,\nif you keep it at a really low memory,\n\n137\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.470\nyou'll see that installation\nprocess being lengthened, there.\n\n138\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.050\nSo that is a little, if you're like,\nwhy is this installation taking so long?\n\n139\n00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.570\nWell, maybe because your memory was just\na little bit too low for that install, but\n\n140\n00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.995\nit's doable.\n\n141\n00:07:37.995 --> 00:07:41.103\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so getting back to the screen,\n\n142\n00:07:41.103 --> 00:07:43.670\nthey're recommending two gigs.\n\n143\n00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.830\nI might bump that up to four gigs, and\n\n144\n00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.860\nI'll just click it up to\nbump it up to four gigs.\n\n145\n00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.747\nIt's really that simple, so\nthis installation is gonna take four gigs.\n\n146\n00:07:52.747 --> 00:07:56.119\nWe could adjust the processors up,\nbut again,\n\n147\n00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:58.911\nwe still got these defined resources.\n\n148\n00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:03.310\n&gt;&gt; You might not have this machine\nrunning a lot of services and programs.\n\n149\n00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.210\nMaybe it's just a really\nlightweight machine.\n\n150\n00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.760\nAnd you don't wanna waste all your system\nresources on this one particular machine.\n\n151\n00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.490\nSo it's gonna be whatever you choose for\nyour environment.\n\n152\n00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.208\n&gt;&gt; And this is just for training purposes.\n\n153\n00:08:14.208 --> 00:08:19.107\nSo we probably could easily get by with\nthat two gigs, a single processor.\n\n154\n00:08:19.107 --> 00:08:20.730\nBut I could bump the processor up.\n\n155\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:25.808\nAgain, you have limitations because this\nis a dual core or a quad core processor.\n\n156\n00:08:25.808 --> 00:08:28.803\nAnd I can't exceed what\nthe actual hardware is.\n\n157\n00:08:28.803 --> 00:08:30.380\n&gt;&gt; Your physical limitations, yeah.\n\n158\n00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm gonna leave that the same.\n\n159\n00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.220\nThis is the one change\nthat I have to make here.\n\n160\n00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:43.313\nAnd what we're doing, if you can see,\nI click here on the DVD drive.\n\n161\n00:08:43.313 --> 00:08:48.680\nAnd I define where\nthe installation media is.\n\n162\n00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.510\nAnd when we're talking media,\nwe're talking typically like a CD-\n\n163\n00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.650\n&gt;&gt; Because we don't have a DVD or\n\n164\n00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.900\nCD bay in our virtual machine.\n\n165\n00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.430\nI can't walk over to my virtual\nmachine and push the button for\n\n166\n00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.025\nthat eject tray to come out, can I?\n\n167\n00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:01.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n168\n00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.630\nwhat I do here is I actually click Browse.\n\n169\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.570\nYou saw where I could click Browse.\n\n170\n00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.032\nAnd then what I'm gonna\ndo is go to my C drive.\n\n171\n00:09:10.032 --> 00:09:15.720\nI'll start with My PC and\nscroll down, This PC.\n\n172\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.190\nIt's not my-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n173\n00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.990\ndepending on what\noperating system you're in.\n\n174\n00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.760\n&gt;&gt; I'm operating under Windows 10, here.\n\n175\n00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.990\nSo I click here, wake up,\nand then I go down.\n\n176\n00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:32.960\nAnd the name that I have for\nthis particular, so we go to ISO.\n\n177\n00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.420\nAnd what I've done is much the same as\nwhen we were going through the history of\n\n178\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.789\nWindows, is somewhere here\nI have Microsoft Windows.\n\n179\n00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.599\nAnd I have kinda a history base here.\n\n180\n00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:45.840\nI go back to 2000.\n\n181\n00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.466\nI got 2003.\n\n182\n00:09:46.466 --> 00:09:47.720\n&gt;&gt; You got a nice little collection there,\nsee?\n\n183\n00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm gonna go,\nhere, to this guy.\n\n184\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.380\nAnd I'm gonna try and pick my choice here.\n\n185\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:58.430\nAnd you see that there is R2, and\nthat's what we're gonna install.\n\n186\n00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:04.301\nIt's kinda small up there, but\nit basically gives us the ISO file,\n\n187\n00:10:04.301 --> 00:10:07.192\nwhich is 2008 R2 Standard.\n\n188\n00:10:07.192 --> 00:10:13.009\nSo I'm gonna click OK, and\nthen I click OK, again.\n\n189\n00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:17.374\nAnd then I click right down here, and\nwe have Play the virtual machine.\n\n190\n00:10:17.374 --> 00:10:21.693\nAnd now what's gonna happen is that\nthis is going to start the install.\n\n191\n00:10:21.693 --> 00:10:25.524\nAnd I'm not gonna continue this\nvideo as we go through the install.\n\n192\n00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:28.415\nBut it will go through\na standard sort of install.\n\n193\n00:10:28.415 --> 00:10:32.030\nIf you came to a machine that had\nnothing on it, you threw the DVD in,\n\n194\n00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.599\nand it-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n195\n00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:36.740\nyou literally just built a virtual machine\nwithin the matter of minutes, here?\n\n196\n00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, I built the environment.\n\n197\n00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.750\nI could have taken away, for example,\nthe floppy disk if I wanted to.\n\n198\n00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.534\nAnd you will do things like that because,\nguess what?\n\n199\n00:10:47.534 --> 00:10:50.116\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even my physical machine doesn't have\n\n200\n00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:52.630\na floppy drive, so\nwhy would I want one on there?\n\n201\n00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.967\nAnd so right now, it's gonna go through\nthe whole installation process.\n\n202\n00:10:56.967 --> 00:11:00.120\nIt depends upon your host machine,\nhow powerful it is.\n\n203\n00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.640\nIt depends upon how much RAM I\ndecided to give the virtual machine.\n\n204\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.974\n&gt;&gt; But it really is just that easy.\n\n205\n00:11:04.974 --> 00:11:07.134\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I'm gonna click Next.\n\n206\n00:11:07.134 --> 00:11:08.794\n&gt;&gt; Just try it.\n\n207\n00:11:08.794 --> 00:11:10.710\nYou're not gonna hurt anything.\n\n208\n00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.570\nYou can always delete the machine and\nthen go through the steps again.\n\n209\n00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.050\nThat's really the best\nway you're gonna learn,\n\n210\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.185\nis through that extra practice\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and when in doubt,\n\n211\n00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:19.393\nclick Next, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:19.393 --> 00:11:22.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Click Next, Next, Next, and Finish.\n\n213\n00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.260\nIf you screwed something up, well, you\njust get rid of the machine and you go on.\n\n214\n00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.910\nSo that's kind of the whole process.\n\n215\n00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.840\nSo I think that probably a good-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n216\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.480\nand your coach should have slides, and\nthat's what I have on my machine, here.\n\n217\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.190\nBut Steve just walked\nyou through those steps.\n\n218\n00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.707\nSo you just have an extra tool\nat your disposal, as well.\n\n219\n00:11:44.707 --> 00:11:49.165\nThank you for tuning in, and\nI think you've got some homework, now.\n\n220\n00:11:49.165 --> 00:11:52.800\n[LAUGH] So you can either pause the videos\nor come back to them a little bit later.\n\n221\n00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.690\nBut we'll still be here.\n\n222\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:54.830\nWe have more heading your way.\n\n223\n00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.240\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this episode.\n\n224\n00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.220\nAnd I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n225\n00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.850\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n226\n00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.891\nSee you next, on here at CyberPatriot\n\n227\n00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:09.963\n[MUSIC]\n\n228\n00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:13.214\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:15.661\n[SOUND] Welcome cyber patriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:18.240\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.540\nAnd in this particular segment,\n\n7\n00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.700\nwe're going to be looking at\nan overview of unit seven.\n\n8\n00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.190\nThis is going to be\nMicrosoft Windows security tools.\n\n9\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.610\nWith us today we have\nProfessor Steven Linthicum.\n\n10\n00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.170\nThank you for joining us today Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.110\n&gt;&gt; Hi everybody, you're really going to\nenjoy this unit because we're actually\n\n12\n00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.150\ngonna go inside of a virtual image and\nplay around a bit.\n\n13\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.970\nAnd the way that I've structured this\nvirtual image is to design it so\n\n14\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.190\nthat basically it's like you\nwould be in competition.\n\n15\n00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.530\nI did that on purpose so\n\n16\n00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.490\nthat I illustrate to you some of the\nchallenges that you may encounter, okay.\n\n17\n00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.960\nSo let's get started with the slides.\n\n18\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.147\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there's me,\nI have a different shirt on.\n\n19\n00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:01.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so we're doing unit seven,\n\n20\n00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.880\nwe're gonna talk about\nMicrosoft Windows Security Tools.\n\n21\n00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.970\nAnd our learning objectives\nare participants will understand where\n\n22\n00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.290\nbasic Windows operating system\nsecurity tools are located.\n\n23\n00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.230\nAnd we're talking about inside\nof Windows incidentally.\n\n24\n00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.390\nWe're not looking at outside tools.\n\n25\n00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.760\nAnd they're going to be important\nrelative to the competition because there\n\n26\n00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.380\nare a couple tools that you'll see out in\nthe extra materials that I'm proving you\n\n27\n00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.020\nwith links to effectively download.\n\n28\n00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.090\nAnd when you're in competition,\nwhen you're in competition,\n\n29\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.740\nwhat you probably will wanna do is have\nthose tools on a jump drive so that you\n\n30\n00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.010\ncan put them in a USB port on your\ncomputer, and then actually bring them in.\n\n31\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.810\n&gt;&gt; Like a little software tool kit?\n\n32\n00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n33\n00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.100\nBecause, guess what?\n\n34\n00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.224\nIf some of these are pretty big and it's\nmuch faster rather than having to download\n\n35\n00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:55.460\nthem from the Internet to\nhave them locally available.\n\n36\n00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.770\nAnd that's something that everybody does.\n\n37\n00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.770\nI don't think that CyberPatriot\nhas any particular rules that\n\n38\n00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.645\nprohibit that sort of activity, and\nso if it doesn't prohibit it, and\n\n39\n00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:13.255\nit's reasonable, it's probably okay\nto assume that it's allowable.\n\n40\n00:02:13.255 --> 00:02:16.570\nThe only challenge is that they do have\nspecific rules relative to the tools that\n\n41\n00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.645\nyou use because the competition\nneeds to be evenly handed.\n\n42\n00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:24.785\nAnd so they've got to be free tools,\nthat's one of the requirements.\n\n43\n00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:25.985\n&gt;&gt; That's a good rule to have.\n\n44\n00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:31.200\n&gt;&gt; Right, because if you're in my area for\nexample, in Sacramento,\n\n45\n00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.630\nwe have a Granite Bay School and probably\nthose kids could better afford to actually\n\n46\n00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.410\npurchase the tools because their parents\nmight give them the money to purchase it.\n\n47\n00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.930\nThen some of the lest economically\nadvantaged areas so again,\n\n48\n00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.130\nthey're trying to maintain\nthe status quo and\n\n49\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.090\nlevel playing field as much as possible so\nthat is a limitation,\n\n50\n00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.510\nit's got to be free Meaning,\nit's freeware in essence, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.570\nBut all the tools we'll gonna talk about\nin this video are specifically all\n\n52\n00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.440\npart of Windows.\n\n53\n00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.800\nAnd participants will learn how\nto manage Window Accounts and\n\n54\n00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.600\nhow their account management\naffects security.\n\n55\n00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.160\nBecause we talked about this\nin the past permissions.\n\n56\n00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.410\nAccess to resources and\nthen what you can do with those resources.\n\n57\n00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.530\nSo, that pretty much covered, and\nyou can see there is a list here,\n\n58\n00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.170\nwe're gonna obviously look at\nthe control panel, administrative tools,\n\n59\n00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.660\nthe action center, although I'll\nprobably wont spend much time there,\n\n60\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.160\nthat just gives you a clue that you might\nhave some issues, Windows Firewall and\n\n61\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.670\nWIndows Update, and\nwe're gonna look at also things like\n\n62\n00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.400\nWindows Defender which I don't think's on\nthis list, but I'm gonna talk about it.\n\n63\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.289\n&gt;&gt; Pretty useful, yeah.\n\n64\n00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:41.000\nSo, I'm excited.\n\n65\n00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.080\nThat sounds like a really good list\nto go ahead and get started with.\n\n66\n00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.120\nSo, let's go ahead and\nwrap up this segment so\n\n67\n00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.990\nwe can get into the good stuff here,\nso stay tuned.\n\n68\n00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.710\nWe have some really interesting\ndemos coming your way.\n\n69\n00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.180\nAnd signing off for this episode,\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n70\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.000\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n71\n00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.665\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at CyberPatriot.\n\n72\n00:03:59.665 --> 00:04:05.648\n[MUSIC]\n\n73\n00:04:05.648 --> 00:04:08.550\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:15.810\n&gt;&gt; Welcome Cyber Patriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.260\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.810\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at some really cool tools.\n\n7\n00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.200\nWe have basic security policies and tools.\n\n8\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.320\nTo go ahead and help us demo those today,\n\n9\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.670\nwe have Professor Steve Linthicum\nin the studio.\n\n10\n00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.200\nThank you for joining us, Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.610\n&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm excited about this.\n\n12\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.490\nAs I mentioned in the previous video,\n\n13\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.870\nwhat we're gonna be focusing\non is actually my desktop.\n\n14\n00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.480\nThis is a virtual machine,\na Windows 7 virtual machine.\n\n15\n00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.480\nAnd what I've done is I've created\na scenario that has some of the sort of\n\n16\n00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.200\nthings that you might expect to exist\nrelative to what you encounter for\n\n17\n00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.173\nthe competitions.\n\n18\n00:00:52.173 --> 00:00:56.900\nThis is actually, some of this is,\nI wasn't that creative,\n\n19\n00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.440\nI just copied an existing-\n&gt;&gt; I think you were, yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.140\n&gt;&gt; Well, I copied an existing scenario\nout there that Professor Dan Manson and\n\n21\n00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.940\nhis students at Cal Poly University,\nthat's in southern California, in Pomona.\n\n22\n00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.700\nThey developed,\nwe had a state championship.\n\n23\n00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.450\nIt was a demonstration event, and\nthey produced a bunch of images.\n\n24\n00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.740\nAnd so, I kind of modified\ntheir scenario a little bit.\n\n25\n00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.870\nAnd I'm not actually using their image\nbecause you as students will have\n\n26\n00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.290\naccess to that image and\na bunch of other images.\n\n27\n00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.150\nWhat we're doing is we're gonna create\na library of images from which you\n\n28\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.350\ncan practice.\n\n29\n00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.420\nWhich makes a lot of sense.\n\n30\n00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.150\n&gt;&gt; Very nice, yeah.\n\n31\n00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.330\n&gt;&gt; So, if we can bring up my desktop for\na moment.\n\n32\n00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.690\nThis is what you would walk into and see.\n\n33\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.700\nThis is a Windows 7.\n\n34\n00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.890\n&gt;&gt; Like a scenario that you may\nencounter during the competition.\n\n35\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, during the competition.\n\n36\n00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.680\nYou can see we have\nfour users listed here.\n\n37\n00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.805\nWe have Steve, who is me, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:57.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We have Larry, Curly, and Moe.\n\n39\n00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.160\nAnd if you've ever watched\nthe Three Stooges,\n\n40\n00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.270\nthat's the name of the Three Stooges.\n\n41\n00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I thought that was a pretty good one.\n\n42\n00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course.\n\n43\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.730\n&gt;&gt; Trying to be a little humorous.\n\n44\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.300\nSo what we do is we go over and\nwe click on a user.\n\n45\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.080\nI'll click on Steve, and I'm going,\nI don't know what Steve's password is.\n\n46\n00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.860\n&gt;&gt; Do you have any pets?\n\n47\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We already talked about that.\n\n48\n00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.360\nYou're not gonna be\nusing your animal names.\n\n49\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.310\n&gt;&gt; Dog, D-O-G, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.820\nThat didn't work, so\nI'm kinda caught here in a quandary,\n\n51\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.510\nmeaning how do I get back\nto where I need to get.\n\n52\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.990\nSo if we go here, and we go,\nso how do I get back?\n\n53\n00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.040\nDoes anybody know?\n\n54\n00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.410\nThere we go, we hit escape, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.610\nNow the reason I showed that is because\nyou're sitting there scratching your head,\n\n56\n00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.600\nand you may not know how to go\nback to where you get this one.\n\n57\n00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.770\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nkinda shortcut things.\n\n58\n00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.820\nI know that, since I built this image,\n\n59\n00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.320\nthat Larry here,\nLarry doesn't have a password.\n\n60\n00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.220\nAnd that may be a common, so you would go\nthrough and you would start with Curly,\n\n61\n00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.720\nand if you get blocked out\ncuz he has a password-\n\n62\n00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.650\n&gt;&gt; Process of elimination, go through,\n\n63\n00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.400\ncheck the accounts to see what\nis not password protected.\n\n64\n00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.035\n&gt;&gt; Eventually,\nyou get a user who has no password.\n\n65\n00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:12.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Larry.\n\n66\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.340\n&gt;&gt; And pretty standard with the Cyber\nPatriot is one of the first things that\n\n67\n00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.040\nyou'll wanna do is you'll wanna\nlook at a file called Read Me.\n\n68\n00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.700\nRead Me provides us with the scenario.\n\n69\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.520\nAnd so, I click on Read Me, double-click\nto bring it up, and here it is.\n\n70\n00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.730\nAnd I'll read the scenario.\n\n71\n00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.450\nIt says under the leadership of Curly,\nthe king of nerds,\n\n72\n00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.750\nyou Steve, so you're playing my role,\n\n73\n00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.490\nhave been hired as a new systems\nadministrator for the central spy server.\n\n74\n00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.160\nNow, interestingly enough,\nthis is a work station product.\n\n75\n00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.920\nI had kept that language the same just\nto prove that Windows 7 can be a server.\n\n76\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.440\nYou probably wouldn't want it that\nway from a security perspective\n\n77\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.900\nbecause you cant tighten it down\nprobably as mush as you can a server.\n\n78\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.300\nYou could, but it would be more painful.\n\n79\n00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.600\nYou would have to be more creative.\n\n80\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.510\nAnd so it goes on and\n\n81\n00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.675\nsays your job is to ensure the security\nand maintenance of this server.\n\n82\n00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:15.300\nThis server will be used as an IIS\nweb server, and TelNet client.\n\n83\n00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.800\nNow, I will tell you, from a practical\nstandpoint, it's okay as a TelNet client,\n\n84\n00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.820\nbut you wouldn't probably never from\na security perspective want your-\n\n85\n00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.670\n&gt;&gt; It's an unsecure protocol, yeah.\n\n86\n00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.920\n&gt;&gt; Windows workstation\nto be an IIS server.\n\n87\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.920\nThat's what servers are for.\n\n88\n00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n89\n00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.546\n&gt;&gt; So you would be using Server 2016.\n\n90\n00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.290\nIt just, you could, if you wanted,\n\n91\n00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.880\nin your little home environment, with\nnobody getting access to the Internet.\n\n92\n00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.820\nYou could run it as a web server,\nand we'll see where you can do that.\n\n93\n00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.580\nBut I wouldn't ever do it from a practical\nstandpoint, I guess I could say.\n\n94\n00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are solutions\nthat are actually designed for\n\n95\n00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.480\nthat particular purpose.\n\n96\n00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes.\n\n97\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.665\nSo, let me see.\n\n98\n00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:01.220\nAnd we're running a TelNet client.\n\n99\n00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.468\nThere should be no personal files, media,\nor any hacking tools on the server.\n\n100\n00:05:07.468 --> 00:05:10.980\nAll required programs should be updated.\n\n101\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.060\nAnd that's a pretty\nstandard sort of thing,\n\n102\n00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.510\nyou wanna keep everything updated and\npatched.\n\n103\n00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.460\nPlease note the following\nauthorized users.\n\n104\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.670\nAnd we've got administrators.\n\n105\n00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.752\nAnd we've got administrator,\nwhich is a built-in, incidentally,\n\n106\n00:05:22.752 --> 00:05:24.950\nadministrative account,\nyou'll see that there.\n\n107\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.829\nSteve and Larry.\n\n108\n00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:31.880\nUsers, and we're really talking\nabout pretty much limited users,\n\n109\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.050\njust your standard sort of user.\n\n110\n00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.780\nMo and Curly.\n\n111\n00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.100\nPassword for Steve,\nthe primary administrator, is change me.\n\n112\n00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.890\nNow notice they're using change\nme probably for a reason.\n\n113\n00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.700\nIt's probably not the best of passwords.\n\n114\n00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.580\nSo the idea here is that they're kinda\nprobably gonna giving us a clue that maybe\n\n115\n00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.480\nwe ought to change the passwords for\nSteve.\n\n116\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.925\nOne of the first things\nwe do when we get in.\n\n117\n00:05:55.105 --> 00:06:00.315\nAnd then they go down, they say please\nnote even though you may fix something,\n\n118\n00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:01.925\nyou may not receive points for it.\n\n119\n00:06:01.925 --> 00:06:03.405\nAnd that's one of the standards here.\n\n120\n00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:06.295\nNot everything you fix gives you points.\n\n121\n00:06:06.295 --> 00:06:09.364\nAnd then they say do not edit anything for\n\n122\n00:06:09.364 --> 00:06:14.067\nanything in the Cyber Patriot\nscoring report folder, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:14.067 --> 00:06:18.740\nI don't see the r on folder,\nso they need to correct that.\n\n124\n00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.180\nBut it's good enough.\n\n125\n00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.000\nWe have instructions that\nwill get us through this.\n\n126\n00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.880\nSo, one of the first things that I\nwould probably do here is, okay,\n\n127\n00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.330\nnow I'm logged in as a user,\nI don't want to be logged in.\n\n128\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.020\nI wanna make sure I'm logged in as\nan administrator, and I don't know at this\n\n129\n00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.110\npoint whether this particular user,\nLarry, is an administrator.\n\n130\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.140\nBut I've been told that the primary\nadministrator is Steve.\n\n131\n00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.130\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go here,\nand I'm gonna go right here and\n\n132\n00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.840\nI'm gonna go log out, log off, right?\n\n133\n00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.650\n&gt;&gt; So now we know Steve's password.\n\n134\n00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we do.\n\n135\n00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.430\nWe have that clue.\n\n136\n00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.660\nSo I can go over here to Steve,\nI can go here and I can type in change me.\n\n137\n00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.310\nC, H, A, N, G, E, M, E.\n\n138\n00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.790\nAgain, probably a clue for points, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n140\n00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.000\n&gt;&gt; So now, I'm in as Steve.\n\n141\n00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.430\nHe's got the Read Me file up,\n\n142\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.280\nwhich is kind of a good thing because\nI can go here and I can bring it up.\n\n143\n00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.080\nAnd you should, incidentally, it would\nbe ideal if you have a printer around.\n\n144\n00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.160\nWhat you can do with this product\nis I can actually drag it to\n\n145\n00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.230\nmy desktop-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n146\n00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.440\n&gt;&gt; On the other machine.\n\n147\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.750\nThat's one thing that virtual,\nVMware player, allows you to do.\n\n148\n00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.650\nYou can drag a file from\none location to another.\n\n149\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.450\nYou can go from-\n&gt;&gt; So when you have that print out,\n\n150\n00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.120\nyou can use it kind of like your\nchecklist to make sure you're covering\n\n151\n00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.718\nall your bases here.\n\n152\n00:07:37.718 --> 00:07:40.650\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so what I would print it.\n\n153\n00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.830\nAnd what I do is copy\nit over to basically-\n\n154\n00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.210\n&gt;&gt; Your physical machine.\n\n155\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.349\n&gt;&gt; My physical machine.\n\n156\n00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.138\nYou can do that by grabbing it.\n\n157\n00:07:49.138 --> 00:07:53.101\nI'm not gonna show you, but you can just\ngrab it from the desktop and then drag it-\n\n158\n00:07:53.101 --> 00:07:53.959\n&gt;&gt; Slide it on over, cool.\n\n159\n00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:56.467\n&gt;&gt; Onto the other desktop,\nopen it and print it, and\n\n160\n00:07:56.467 --> 00:07:59.380\nthen hand out copies of this\nto all the team members.\n\n161\n00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.231\n&gt;&gt; So one thing I did want to ask you,\nSteve,\n\n162\n00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.800\nis when you're in this environment and\n\n163\n00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.120\nyou're performing these tasks, will all\nyour teammates be having access to this,\n\n164\n00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.500\nor is it like on one system and you all\nkind of hover around and work together?\n\n165\n00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.520\nOr how does that really work?\n\n166\n00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.810\n&gt;&gt; The best sort of structure\nthat you can have is,\n\n167\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.200\nyou're gonna be doing multiple\nimages at the same time.\n\n168\n00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.150\nYou might have a Windows 7,\n\n169\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:25.120\nyou might have perhaps a server version,\nand then you might have Ubuntu.\n\n170\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.268\nAnd so, if you've got a team of five\npeople, for example, you might have your\n\n171\n00:08:30.268 --> 00:08:35.182\nWindows workstation expert sitting in\nfront of a machine with Windows 7,\n\n172\n00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:41.160\nyour server expert sitting at another\nwith the image up, and then the Ubuntu.\n\n173\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.670\nAnd then, if you're fortunate\nenough to have the maximum,\n\n174\n00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.710\nwhich would be five people, you would\nhave the other two on other machines and\n\n175\n00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.380\nthey would be your googlers.\n\n176\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n177\n00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.460\nBecause Google is where\nyou find the answers.\n\n178\n00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.820\nThat's something that, I mean,\nit makes a lot of sense.\n\n179\n00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.160\nYou're gonna run into issues where\nyou need to know how to do something.\n\n180\n00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.580\nAnd so keyword searching is critical.\n\n181\n00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.870\nThings you need to know about keyword\nsearching is use those quote marks.\n\n182\n00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.060\nIf it's a phrase that you're looking for,\nput quotes around it because that narrows\n\n183\n00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.220\nyour search and will get you to the answer\nthat you're looking for much quicker.\n\n184\n00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.860\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n185\n00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.520\n&gt;&gt; So there are all kind of, one of the\nthings that we probably should be teaching\n\n186\n00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.640\nat the middle school level, at the high\nschool level, and repeat at my level is\n\n187\n00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.330\nhow to search on Google because it's\nan extraordinary tool for finding things.\n\n188\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.000\nSo here we are, we have our scenario.\n\n189\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.590\nLet me, all right, let me just enlarge\nthis so it takes up my entire screen.\n\n190\n00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.450\nAnd so, that's good, we're ready to go.\n\n191\n00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:45.735\nAnd one of the first area's, let me see\nif I can get there real quick for us.\n\n192\n00:09:45.735 --> 00:09:53.084\nThat we'll probably take a look\nat is the control panel.\n\n193\n00:09:53.084 --> 00:09:54.980\nAnd again, the default view for\n\n194\n00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.970\nthe control panel is this guy right here,\nis category.\n\n195\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.460\nTakes too many clicks for\nme to get where I wanna go.\n\n196\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.300\nAs a matter fact,\nI'd probably go into God mode.\n\n197\n00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.150\nBut I told you how to do that.\n\n198\n00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.950\nAgain, it's Google.\n\n199\n00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.040\nLook up God mode.\n\n200\n00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.280\nAnd you could do that.\n\n201\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.160\nI'm not gonna do that for\nthis demonstration,\n\n202\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.660\nbut I'm at least gonna get me where I\nlike to be, and that's with small icons.\n\n203\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.040\nThat's a preference.\n\n204\n00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.580\nProbably hard for you to see.\n\n205\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.190\nAnd later on we're gonna talk about\nthe action center, but it's right here.\n\n206\n00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.850\nIt's under A, and there it is.\n\n207\n00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.740\nAnd things are not exactly looking\ngood on this machine as you can tell.\n\n208\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.780\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, red.\nThat's kind of a universal color for\n\n209\n00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.750\nwarning, right?\n\n210\n00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n211\n00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:32.846\n&gt;&gt; Danger, Will Robinson.\n\n212\n00:10:32.846 --> 00:10:34.880\n&gt;&gt; And that's probably my fault.\n\n213\n00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.550\nAdministrative Tools, that's here.\n\n214\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:44.770\nWe can go a bunch,\nI can go through all these.\n\n215\n00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.980\nAuto Play, I wouldn't worry about.\n\n216\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.650\nBackup and Restore.\n\n217\n00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.710\nWe're gonna talk about that, but\nMicrosoft's back up tool, frankly,\n\n218\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.130\nis something that people just don't use.\n\n219\n00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.680\nThat's probably indicative of its, well,\n\n220\n00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.070\nit's indicative of something, but it's not\ncommonly used in business and industry.\n\n221\n00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:09.340\nAnd hopefully, you're gonna use some sort\nof backup tool that really works for you.\n\n222\n00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:15.320\nOne of the challenges with its backup\ntools, it puts in a file that is a file\n\n223\n00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.910\nthat you just can't click on and open up\nand see what the heck's inside that file.\n\n224\n00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.640\nSo you have to actually,\nto view what's in there,\n\n225\n00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.320\nyou have to actually be using\nthe Backup and Restore tool.\n\n226\n00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.770\nI much prefer something where I can back\nit up, and it's in its native format.\n\n227\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:34.550\nSo it's like your C drive, but\nthat you can find things, and\n\n228\n00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.500\nyou know that they're backed up,\ncuz if you don't\n\n229\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.470\nuse that kind of program where you know\nit's backed up, you use this product.\n\n230\n00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.920\nAnd periodically you have to test it\nto make sure it really did back up.\n\n231\n00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.360\nAnd yeah, and, and, and.\n\n232\n00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.370\nAnd then we've got just\na whole bunch of things.\n\n233\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.280\nBitLocker for drive for encryption.\n\n234\n00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.340\nColor management.\n\n235\n00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.656\nJust tons of stuff, and we're not gonna\nspend a lot of time in most of these,\n\n236\n00:11:59.656 --> 00:12:03.270\nwell, most of these we're-\n&gt;&gt; Well definitely get familiar with them.\n\n237\n00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.520\nYou can go through and click on them and\nplay in the environment.\n\n238\n00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.510\nThat's how you're gonna get,\nfamiliarize yourself.\n\n239\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.080\nAnd like Steve showed us, administrative\ntools, that's a big one, right?\n\n240\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.040\nSo Microsoft says, look, here's a list\nof tools that can help you manage\n\n241\n00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.570\nyour system that I think are helpful.\n\n242\n00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.020\nSo definitely spend some time in there,\nalso.\n\n243\n00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.250\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n244\n00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:27.100\nSo that's probably a pretty good place\nto stop to end this particular part.\n\n245\n00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.883\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we can do that.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's gonna be a multipart.\n\n246\n00:12:28.883 --> 00:12:32.778\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so don't go anywhere, because\nwe do have some more demonstration.\n\n247\n00:12:32.778 --> 00:12:35.580\nAnd we want to show you some\nother security tools that you do\n\n248\n00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.600\nhave integrated right into\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n249\n00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.214\nSo for this particular episode,\nwe'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n250\n00:12:41.214 --> 00:12:43.610\nAs your host, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n251\n00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:45.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n252\n00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.848\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at CyberPatriot.\n\n253\n00:12:48.848 --> 00:12:54.769\n[MUSIC]\n\n254\n00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:58.032\n&gt;&gt;

Welcome Cyber Patriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.720\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.480\nAnd this is a continuation episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.260\nwe're gonna be looking at our\nbasic security policies part two.\n\n8\n00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.020\nWith us today to help\nus demo these concepts,\n\n9\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.570\nwe have Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n10\n00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.890\nThank you for joining us today Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.415\n&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.\n&gt;&gt; What we're gonna do is we're gonna look\n\n12\n00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:33.594\nat my desktop and we're gonna go through.\n\n13\n00:00:33.594 --> 00:00:38.440\nAnd again,\nbe in the control panel where we left off.\n\n14\n00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.690\nSo why don't we bring up my desktop and\nhere we go.\n\n15\n00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.140\nWhat we're gonna be first looking at\nare some local security policies.\n\n16\n00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.700\nAnd the way we get there is we\nget on the control panel and\n\n17\n00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.520\nwe click on administrative tools.\n\n18\n00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.040\nThat's, again,\nthere are variety of ways to get there.\n\n19\n00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.790\nYou could probably go down and\ntype in the text box\n\n20\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.460\nfrom the Start button Administrative Tools\nand get to the same place.\n\n21\n00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.760\nBut here's where we are,\n\n22\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.260\nand what we're gonna wanna do is\nlook at the local security policies.\n\n23\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.570\nAgain, they have an alphabetical\norder which is pretty typical.\n\n24\n00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.740\nSo down here, you can see that my\npointer is on Local Security Policies.\n\n25\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.760\nSo I'm gonna bring that up and\nover here on the left, in this pane,\n\n26\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.610\nactually left and\nthe right pane are the same.\n\n27\n00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.350\nThat's not always the case.\n\n28\n00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.300\nYou can see that we have account\npolicies and we have local policies, and\n\n29\n00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.440\na whole bunch of other policies,\nbasically.\n\n30\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.976\nAnd if you have lots of time, might be a\ngood idea familiarizing yourself by going\n\n31\n00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:37.172\nthrough each one of these.\n\n32\n00:01:37.172 --> 00:01:38.656\nBut that's gonna take you a while.\n\n33\n00:01:38.656 --> 00:01:41.900\nSo we'll look account policies first.\n\n34\n00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.322\nAnd what we have here is we\nhave two account policies.\n\n35\n00:01:45.322 --> 00:01:51.381\nWe have a password policy and\na local account lockout policy, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:51.961\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n37\n00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:56.704\n&gt;&gt; So, what we wanna do is, we're gonna be\nsetting some of the parameters associated\n\n38\n00:01:56.704 --> 00:01:58.415\nfirst with password policy.\n\n39\n00:01:58.415 --> 00:01:58.998\nI think-\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n40\n00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:01.053\ndo you wanna take a look at some\nof those parameters on my slide?\n\n41\n00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:02.768\n&gt;&gt; Yes, why don't you bring up your slide.\n\n42\n00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:06.433\n&gt;&gt; Okay, this is just basically showing\nwhat you had just showed us Steve.\n\n43\n00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:08.979\nWhere to go ahead and\naccess our administrative tools,\n\n44\n00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.370\nin our local security policy,\nunder administrative tools.\n\n45\n00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.570\nAnd then moving forward, these are the\nparameters that I guess CyberPatriot\n\n46\n00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.480\nhas set forth for some good guidelines for\nyour password policies.\n\n47\n00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.070\nAnd if we see here, they say what?\n\n48\n00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.730\nOur password history, so\nthis is the age of that password.\n\n49\n00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.520\nThey recommend not being able to\nuse the last five passwords here.\n\n50\n00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.460\nThat's what it looks like.\n\n51\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.677\nFive passwords remembered.\n\n52\n00:02:33.677 --> 00:02:37.305\nThe maximum password age,\nwell for 90 days for users,\n\n53\n00:02:37.305 --> 00:02:41.399\nbut when we're talking about\nadmins they recommend 30 days.\n\n54\n00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:45.630\nAnd then we look at the, oops,\nthis one is the password age here hold on.\n\n55\n00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.160\nLet me see here,\n\n56\n00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.110\npassword history the number of old\npasswords the computer remembers.\n\n57\n00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.860\nSo that's five passwords.\n\n58\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.090\nI tried to add two together,\nthey separate it out here.\n\n59\n00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.440\nThe minimum password\nage is ten to 30 days.\n\n60\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.880\nThat's how long a user must keep\na password before changing it.\n\n61\n00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.000\nSo okay, so they even set that\nminimum password age as well.\n\n62\n00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.990\nMinimum password length here for\nthis password policy is eight characters.\n\n63\n00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.020\nThat's, like we talked about before,\nthat's our bare minimum there, right?\n\n64\n00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.530\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.\n\n65\n00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.266\n&gt;&gt; And complexity requirements,\n\n66\n00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:18.487\nwhether the users must use at\nleast three of the following.\n\n67\n00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:22.586\nSo they want them to go ahead and\nuse upper case letters,\n\n68\n00:03:22.586 --> 00:03:28.013\nlower case letters, numbers, and\nsymbols, so three of the following.\n\n69\n00:03:28.013 --> 00:03:32.924\nAnd so, let's have a good mixture of\ncomplexity there, which is enabled.\n\n70\n00:03:32.924 --> 00:03:37.227\nAnd reversible encryption, whether\nthe password file on the computer can be\n\n71\n00:03:37.227 --> 00:03:40.550\ndecrypted, and\nthat setting has actually been disabled.\n\n72\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.650\nSo those are the password recommendations\nthat we have set forth here.\n\n73\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, let's get back to my desktop\nand we'll see what we can set up here.\n\n74\n00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.040\nSo, what I'm gonna do is bring\nup the list of those things.\n\n75\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.180\nSo here we go with\nenforce password history.\n\n76\n00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.769\nAnd let me give you an example of why we\nwant some history associated with this.\n\n77\n00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:08.304\nAt my college for the longest time,\nwe had a password history of one.\n\n78\n00:04:08.304 --> 00:04:13.658\nOkay, so what people would do, which\nas human being, as human being we don't\n\n79\n00:04:13.658 --> 00:04:18.606\nwanna remember a bunch of passwords,\nso we would change our passwords to\n\n80\n00:04:18.606 --> 00:04:23.570\nsome new password and then, we would\nchange it back to the old password.\n\n81\n00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n82\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.987\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n83\n00:04:24.987 --> 00:04:26.427\nWe're human beings and guess what?\n\n84\n00:04:26.427 --> 00:04:29.000\nI've beat the system, in essence.\n\n85\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.520\nSo, what you want in a high secure\nenvironment is you don't want then\n\n86\n00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.300\nrepeating that same password.\n\n87\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.030\nSo you might, and\nI'm just gonna throw out a number here,\n\n88\n00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.920\nI'm probably not gonna use\nthe same numbers as them.\n\n89\n00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.036\nI'll give you some justification for it.\n\n90\n00:04:40.036 --> 00:04:43.948\nI'm gonna put it at, I think that's 25.\n\n91\n00:04:43.948 --> 00:04:44.714\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n92\n00:04:44.714 --> 00:04:45.690\n&gt;&gt; Oops, that's 2D.\n\n93\n00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.929\nIt better be a number or\nI'm gonna be in trouble.\n\n94\n00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:52.400\nAnd I click OK.\n\n95\n00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.423\nAnd so now, oops,\nI put it at 24 but that's fine.\n\n96\n00:04:56.423 --> 00:04:59.359\nOne of the reasons you\nwanna go maybe not 24 and\n\n97\n00:04:59.359 --> 00:05:03.472\ngo to 25 is because they could\nuse January, February, March for\n\n98\n00:05:03.472 --> 00:05:05.355\ntwo years and then go,\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n99\n00:05:05.355 --> 00:05:06.063\n&gt;&gt; Go back.\n\n100\n00:05:06.063 --> 00:05:08.640\nSo that avoids the possibility\n\n101\n00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.505\nof them tying their password\nup with the month of the year.\n\n102\n00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:14.352\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n103\n00:05:14.352 --> 00:05:15.224\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n104\n00:05:15.224 --> 00:05:20.516\nIf we had them change it every so often.\n\n105\n00:05:20.516 --> 00:05:24.394\nNow with regard to minimum or\nmaximum password age.\n\n106\n00:05:24.394 --> 00:05:26.786\nThis is where you're gonna get\na notification you gotta change\n\n107\n00:05:26.786 --> 00:05:27.424\nyour password.\n\n108\n00:05:27.424 --> 00:05:28.109\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n109\n00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:28.886\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n110\n00:05:28.886 --> 00:05:32.504\nAnd the default setting here,\nI believe and I don't have my glasses on,\n\n111\n00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:34.300\nit's like 42 days or something.\n\n112\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.660\nIs that what it is?\n\n113\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.661\n&gt;&gt; Let me see here.\n\n114\n00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:39.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I can't,\nI wish I had my glasses but.\n\n115\n00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.286\n&gt;&gt; Yep, 42.\n\n116\n00:05:40.286 --> 00:05:41.816\n&gt;&gt; 42 days.\n\n117\n00:05:41.816 --> 00:05:44.279\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't remember so\nI wanted to verify that.\n\n118\n00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:49.406\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at my college, for example,\nthis is set to 90 days and I know we\n\n119\n00:05:49.406 --> 00:05:54.710\nhad an earlier discussion relative\nto what's the proper length of time.\n\n120\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.070\nThat's 90 everybody complains about,\nquite frankly and\n\n121\n00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.590\nparticularly for a lot of our faculty\nwho work on a semester basis.\n\n122\n00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.050\nIt might be nice if they could keep\nthat same password over the entire\n\n123\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.331\nfour months that a semester goes.\n\n124\n00:06:10.331 --> 00:06:10.887\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n125\n00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:15.861\n&gt;&gt; And so there are reasons for\nmodifying this, potentially reasons for\n\n126\n00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:19.150\nmodifying this to a more reasonable level.\n\n127\n00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.930\nAnd there's a whole discussion\nout there as to whether or\n\n128\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.740\nnot we should have them expire,\ntruthfully, at all.\n\n129\n00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.645\nBecause this would allow us to\nuse a much longer password,\n\n130\n00:06:26.645 --> 00:06:31.580\ncuz we would, as human beings,\ndevote more time to memorizing it.\n\n131\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.050\nDon't put it really,\nreally short, because guess what?\n\n132\n00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.560\nIf I can only use it for 20 days,\n\n133\n00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.980\nI'm gonna have to change\nmy password constantly.\n\n134\n00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.330\nParticularly if I had that password\nhistory that we talked about earlier.\n\n135\n00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.004\nSo I'm just gonna leave it at that.\n\n136\n00:06:46.004 --> 00:06:49.813\nThat's to me, it's not good,\nbut it's not bad.\n\n137\n00:06:49.813 --> 00:06:55.190\nMinimum password aid,\nthis is where you want some time in there.\n\n138\n00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.960\nMore than anything, to stop that,\nokay, I change it today and\n\n139\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.620\nwe don't have a password history.\n\n140\n00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.130\nWe got a password history of one and\ntomorrow I change it back to what it was.\n\n141\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:11.060\nSo we can increase how long they\nhave to keep that password.\n\n142\n00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.000\nAnd I'm just gonna put in five days.\n\n143\n00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.880\nI don't think it's all that relevant.\n\n144\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.200\nMinimum password length,\nwe talked about this.\n\n145\n00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.299\nAnd they had suggested eight characters,\nbut\n\n146\n00:07:24.299 --> 00:07:28.360\nwe know that eight characters\nare pretty easy to break in to.\n\n147\n00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.110\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n148\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.330\n&gt;&gt; And so I might go up to like ten\ncharacters or something more reasonable.\n\n149\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; In today's world.\n\n150\n00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.310\nAnd whether or not it must meet\nthe complexity requirement.\n\n151\n00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.438\nThis is, you can click here and\nit explains what this is all about,\n\n152\n00:07:44.438 --> 00:07:48.862\nand that was true on the other ones but\nit tells you that there are special\n\n153\n00:07:48.862 --> 00:07:54.130\ncharacters that we can effectively require\nby clicking this particular setting.\n\n154\n00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.040\nSo it has to be a certain length and\nthen there has to be the complexity,\n\n155\n00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.760\nupper case, lower case, numbers,\nspecial characters, that sort of thing.\n\n156\n00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.780\nAnd so we just click enable it.\n\n157\n00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.110\nI'm actually gonna cancel outta here,\n\n158\n00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:11.495\nbecause,\n&gt;&gt; Currently your password is changeme,\n\n159\n00:08:11.495 --> 00:08:12.180\nright?\n\n160\n00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:17.349\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's changeme and I'm gonna be\nstuck having a complex password and I\n\n161\n00:08:17.349 --> 00:08:21.265\njust don't want to go there right now cuz,\n&gt;&gt; That's okay,\n\n162\n00:08:21.265 --> 00:08:23.715\nat least we're seeing where\nto make those changes so\n\n163\n00:08:23.715 --> 00:08:26.375\nwe can be in compliance with\nwhatever we may be presented.\n\n164\n00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:30.285\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so as a matter of fact,\nI'm just gonna go in here and\n\n165\n00:08:30.285 --> 00:08:34.565\ncancel out the whole darn thing\nbecause that way I won't be inhibited.\n\n166\n00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.060\nDid it dart back?\n\n167\n00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.042\nNo, it didn't dart back.\n\n168\n00:08:39.042 --> 00:08:44.390\nI'm gonna go here again and reset this so\nI don't run into issues with changeme.\n\n169\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.298\nSo I'm gonna go with the password\nmust be at least, changeme,\n\n170\n00:08:48.298 --> 00:08:50.748\nI think I'm safe with six characters.\n\n171\n00:08:50.748 --> 00:08:51.306\nMakes sense?\n\n172\n00:08:51.306 --> 00:08:51.887\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n173\n00:08:51.887 --> 00:08:52.969\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n174\n00:08:52.969 --> 00:08:54.875\nBut you would \u007fdo whatever is required,\n\n175\n00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:58.203\nyou wouldn't go with six when you're\nactually doing the competition.\n\n176\n00:08:58.203 --> 00:09:00.815\nI'm just kinda clearing things up so\nI don't get stuck with.\n\n177\n00:09:00.815 --> 00:09:03.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I gotta go and modify my password.\n\n178\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.650\nOkay?\n\n179\n00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.460\nSo, that's this set up.\n\n180\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.690\nAnd then we have account lockout policy.\n\n181\n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.890\nAnd what do they tell us, on that one?\n\n182\n00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.240\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at my screen here and\nsee what the parameters are for that one.\n\n183\n00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.710\nAll right.\n\n184\n00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.820\nSo, for our account lockout policies,\n\n185\n00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.950\nwe have, even if you have\nthe strongest password possible,\n\n186\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.860\nif you give hackers unlimited attempts\nto break it, they eventually will.\n\n187\n00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.180\nSo, let's go ahead and implement\nsome kind of lockout policy here.\n\n188\n00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.660\nAccount policies govern unsuccessful\nattempts to log into an account,\n\n189\n00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.510\ntells you where to access that,\nthat's where we were in your system.\n\n190\n00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.500\nThey say,\n\n191\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.430\n30 minutes is going to be the time\nbefore automatically becoming unlocked.\n\n192\n00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.070\nThe threshold here is gonna be between,\nanywhere,\n\n193\n00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.050\nbetween to three to ten\ninvalid login attempts.\n\n194\n00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.480\nSo if you have any failed login\nattempts between that number, they're\n\n195\n00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.730\nlocked you out for 30 minutes and then\nlastly reset accounts counter afterward.\n\n196\n00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.530\nThe number of minutes that must elapsed\nbefore the failed login attempts threshold\n\n197\n00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.870\ncounter is reset to zero and\nthat's set to 30 minutes.\n\n198\n00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.820\n&gt;&gt; Right and so\nthose are fairly reasonable.\n\n199\n00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.080\nI think that the lockout duration.\n\n200\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.250\nNow let me explain something\nabout the lockout duration\n\n201\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.260\nwhich will help you to better\nunderstand what sort of\n\n202\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.750\nrequirements and\nwhy you would set it like you'd set it.\n\n203\n00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:31.340\nBasically, what we want is\nthe account gets locked out.\n\n204\n00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.110\nSo if I try three times and I blow it,\n\n205\n00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.690\nI don't put in my password correctly,\nI'm probably a hacker.\n\n206\n00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.850\nI think three is probably\na pretty reasonable level.\n\n207\n00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:41.429\nTen seems like too many.\n\n208\n00:10:41.429 --> 00:10:43.793\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you see it in our\nmobile devices, our cell phones,\n\n209\n00:10:43.793 --> 00:10:45.218\ncompanies are even utilizing this.\n\n210\n00:10:45.218 --> 00:10:50.102\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so gimme three tries And\nthen I can't go in and\n\n211\n00:10:50.102 --> 00:10:54.510\ntry again successfully for\na period of time.\n\n212\n00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.980\nAnd what we're trying to stop is\nthe brute force sort of attacks.\n\n213\n00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.190\nAnd so if I'm trying to password guess,\ndon't have any idea what your password is.\n\n214\n00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.500\nAnd I'm stuck at three, I get three\ntries and then I'm locked out for\n\n215\n00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.160\na period of time before I can\ncome back in and try again.\n\n216\n00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.470\nThat's the whole deal here, okay?\n\n217\n00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.209\n&gt;&gt; To prevent those automated tools there.\n\n218\n00:11:13.209 --> 00:11:16.819\n&gt;&gt; So, whoops let me get back into here.\n\n219\n00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:22.040\nSo the account lock out threshold,\nhere is where I'm going to set something.\n\n220\n00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.720\nAnd as you noticed I couldn't really\nset anything in that first item.\n\n221\n00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.070\nI have to set something here and\n\n222\n00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:31.910\nI'm gonna go with three, and\nthree is probably pretty typical.\n\n223\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.350\nBecause if you are an employee at\na business and you can't do it on a third\n\n224\n00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.964\ntry, well you deserved to be suspended,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n225\n00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:38.828\n&gt;&gt; For perhaps,\n\n226\n00:11:38.828 --> 00:11:41.354\nI think 30 minutes maybe a little long.\n\n227\n00:11:41.354 --> 00:11:45.570\nI might go with 15 minutes,\nbecause let me,\n\n228\n00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.782\n&gt;&gt; In the business environment,\n\n229\n00:11:46.782 --> 00:11:48.480\nwe talked about this time, time is money.\n\n230\n00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.370\n&gt;&gt; Time is money.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you make that decision there.\n\n231\n00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; So here, suggested values here and\n\n232\n00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.000\nthis is what Microsoft suggests,\nand I'm gonna buy into them but\n\n233\n00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.160\nI'm going to go through and change them.\n\n234\n00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.093\nSo I can go here.\nWhen I accept that, so we got 30 and\n\n235\n00:12:03.093 --> 00:12:04.852\n30, okay?\n\n236\n00:12:04.852 --> 00:12:06.153\nAnd we did see that.\n\n237\n00:12:06.153 --> 00:12:11.466\nSo by going in there and clicking,\nI automatically set these two parameters.\n\n238\n00:12:11.466 --> 00:12:15.060\nNow account lock-out duration,\nI may go in and\n\n239\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:20.120\npersonally modify that down to 15 minutes\nand the reason for that is because that\n\n240\n00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.780\nis a short enough period of time where\nthe employee won't be calling me, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.110\nBecause I've gotta get in quickly.\n\n242\n00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.880\nThey'll know that, if they blow it\nthey've gotta wait 15 minutes and\n\n243\n00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.880\nthen they can automatically try again.\n\n244\n00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.860\nProbably fail again,\nbut try again at least.\n\n245\n00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.200\nSo, we go here and click OK.\n\n246\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:45.170\nAnd I'm just gonna go OK on this\nbecause I don't need to fix it.\n\n247\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.710\nI did changed it back down.\n\n248\n00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.400\nSo, ideally those two the same.\n\n249\n00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.450\nThe reset the account, lock out counter.\n\n250\n00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.440\nThe problem here is\nthat they might try and\n\n251\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.310\nthen they might come back a little\nlater and try again and then try again.\n\n252\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.230\nAnd that's this 15 minute\nthing this bottom one.\n\n253\n00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.160\nDon't worry about it just\nadopt the philosophy.\n\n254\n00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.670\nThis is a pretty good one in my opinion.\n\n255\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.680\nOkay?\n\n256\n00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.820\nSo that basically demonstrates,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we can see where that is.\n\n257\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.850\nNow the next thing on our list\nhere is going to be Action Center.\n\n258\n00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:18.480\nYou briefly showed that whenever we\nwe're looking at administrative tools.\n\n259\n00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.610\nDo we want to take another look at that?\n\n260\n00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can take a look at it.\n\n261\n00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.330\nI'm going back to control panel,\nand here's the Action Center.\n\n262\n00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.515\nAnd these just tells me I got issues.\n\n263\n00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:29.422\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm not not actually gonna,\n\n264\n00:13:29.422 --> 00:13:30.930\n&gt;&gt; The first step is admitting, Steve.\n\n265\n00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.363\nThank you.\n\n266\n00:13:32.363 --> 00:13:34.626\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n267\n00:13:34.626 --> 00:13:38.595\n[LAUGH] Admission, right.\n\n268\n00:13:38.595 --> 00:13:41.619\nAnd I do have issues here and\nI'm not gonna correct them from here,\n\n269\n00:13:41.619 --> 00:13:44.680\nI'm actually gonna correct them\nthrough the control panel.\n\n270\n00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.170\nBut, you can see that they're\nsuggesting that the spyware and\n\n271\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.440\nunwanted software protection.\n\n272\n00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.760\nSomething's missing here.\n\n273\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.111\nProbably some sort of virus protection.\n\n274\n00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:54.897\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a perfect\nsegue into the next topic.\n\n275\n00:13:54.897 --> 00:14:00.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then we got Windows Update.\n\n276\n00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.445\nWe got an issue with.\n\n277\n00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:03.765\nWe got tons of issues here.\n\n278\n00:14:03.765 --> 00:14:05.845\nNetwork, firewall, we got an issue with..\n\n279\n00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.365\n&gt;&gt; We're going to have to\ntake a look at that too.\n\n280\n00:14:07.365 --> 00:14:09.165\nBut you know what Steve,\nwhy don't we do that?\n\n281\n00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:10.655\nLet's go ahead and fix a few things.\n\n282\n00:14:10.655 --> 00:14:15.975\nAnd then come back to Action Center and\nsee how we've affected the Action Center.\n\n283\n00:14:15.975 --> 00:14:16.754\n&gt;&gt; I think that makes sense.\n\n284\n00:14:16.754 --> 00:14:20.195\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at Windows Defender.\n\n285\n00:14:20.195 --> 00:14:22.155\nWe didn't have any kind of malware and\n\n286\n00:14:22.155 --> 00:14:27.550\nI think Microsoft has a Free integrated\nversion right on the operating system.\n\n287\n00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:30.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so here we are again\nback in the control panel, and\n\n288\n00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.770\nwhat we need to do is find Defender.\n\n289\n00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.760\nAnd the challenge is you can't just call\nit Defender because Microsoft wants you to\n\n290\n00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.430\nrecognize that it's not Defender,\nit's Windows Defender.\n\n291\n00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.800\nAnd that would be under the Ws,\nand this would be it right here.\n\n292\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.834\n&gt;&gt; Marketing.\n&gt;&gt; And so I click on it.\n\n293\n00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:45.738\nAnd ooh.\n\n294\n00:14:45.738 --> 00:14:46.575\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n295\n00:14:46.575 --> 00:14:49.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Service has stopped, okay?.\n\n296\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.843\nService has stopped, and so they're\nreally nice to us because they give\n\n297\n00:14:54.843 --> 00:14:59.810\nus a sense that all we need to do\nis click a button to start it.\n\n298\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.680\nAnd I can go ahead and do that, and\n\n299\n00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.200\nthat would be a real simple\nway of solving this.\n\n300\n00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.770\nBut I'm not gonna go directly there and\ndo that,\n\n301\n00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:11.980\nI'm gonna show you basically\nhow it got stopped.\n\n302\n00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.940\nDoes that make sense?\n\n303\n00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.560\nI think it makes perfect sense.\n&gt;&gt; It does,\n\n304\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.639\nyeah let's go ahead and look at that.\n\n305\n00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:15.637\nWhy not we're here.\n\n306\n00:15:15.637 --> 00:15:18.570\n&gt;&gt; So what I'm doing is I clicked\non administrative tools again.\n\n307\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.460\nAnd then if I go into\nthe computer management and\n\n308\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.510\nthis is a common screen where you probably\nshould go on occasion to figure out\n\n309\n00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.710\nWhat's going on with\nthe computer you're managing.\n\n310\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.670\n&gt;&gt; How to manage my computer?\n\n311\n00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.520\nyeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.300\n&gt;&gt; And one of the choices down here as you\n\n313\n00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.970\ncan see is services and applications.\n\n314\n00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.500\nAnd I'm gonna click on services.\n\n315\n00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.070\nThis is the services tab.\n\n316\n00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:44.190\nThese are all of the services that\nare running on your Windows machine.\n\n317\n00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:48.250\nAnd it's important that you\nunderstand this whole thing.\n\n318\n00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.430\nAnd as I go down through it, and\n\n319\n00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:55.160\nI just want to show by way of\nexample here a couple of things.\n\n320\n00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.800\nFirst of all, it's alphabetical, okay?\n\n321\n00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.850\nWe know that, and so\nwe're looking for Windows Defender.\n\n322\n00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.116\nAnd there it just happens to be,\nso I open it up.\n\n323\n00:16:06.116 --> 00:16:10.905\nAnd notice, and I know it's hard to read\nbut right here it says start up type and\n\n324\n00:16:10.905 --> 00:16:12.870\nit says disabled.\n\n325\n00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.220\nThat's probably not what we want for\ndefender.\n\n326\n00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.744\nWe want it up and running.\n\n327\n00:16:17.744 --> 00:16:21.858\n&gt;&gt; Unless you were using a third party\nsoftware, anti-malware solution.\n\n328\n00:16:21.858 --> 00:16:23.770\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nIn essence what happens is\n\n329\n00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:28.520\nwhen you install that third party\nsoftware, it disables this service.\n\n330\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:34.170\nSo we want to enable it, we get some\nchoices here, we get automatic delayed,\n\n331\n00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.185\nstart, automatic, manual and disabled.\n\n332\n00:16:38.185 --> 00:16:42.520\nI'am gonna put it on, you know just\nautomatic, we want it to start.\n\n333\n00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:48.476\nOkay, one of the first things we want\nto come up is Protected from the onset.\n\n334\n00:16:48.476 --> 00:16:50.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes from the beginning of time.\n\n335\n00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.808\nSo we'll do that, okay and\n\n336\n00:16:54.808 --> 00:16:59.260\nthen I'm gonna click okay here.\n\n337\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that would have started it.\n\n338\n00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:06.580\nNow let's go back because I\ndidn't do one other thing and\n\n339\n00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.530\nthat's actually start it but\nlet's see where it's at.\n\n340\n00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.910\nGoing back into the Control Panel here and\n\n341\n00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:17.053\ngoing back to Windows Defender and\nsee how.\n\n342\n00:17:17.053 --> 00:17:18.800\nSo it's not started.\n\n343\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.260\nI enabled it to start automatically.\n\n344\n00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.660\nIt didn't start it, though, so\nI'm gonna click here and hopefully,\n\n345\n00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.870\nit's going to start.\n\n346\n00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:31.820\nAnd, so now it changed and\nit's saying check for updates.\n\n347\n00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.410\nAnd one of the first things I would do to\n\n348\n00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:39.330\nmake sure I got points relative to Windows\nDefender is I would have it do an update.\n\n349\n00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:44.180\nAnd what it's doing is it's updating\nits virus definition files and\n\n350\n00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.560\nbringing it right up to day.\n\n351\n00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.060\nI'm not gonna do that here because we're\ngonna be looking at other things and\n\n352\n00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.170\nI don't want this machine to be\nbusy updating Defender, okay?\n\n353\n00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\nthe next thing we wanna go ahead,\n\n354\n00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.280\nactually let's go ahead and\nbreak for this segment and\n\n355\n00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.925\nwe'll take some extra time to really take\na look at firewalls and the next segment.\n\n356\n00:18:05.925 --> 00:18:08.315\nAnd then we'll head back\nover to action center and\n\n357\n00:18:08.315 --> 00:18:12.205\nsee if we have resolved\nsome of our issues.\n\n358\n00:18:12.205 --> 00:18:13.353\nSo we'll go ahead and stop here.\n\n359\n00:18:13.353 --> 00:18:14.491\nDon't go anywhere.\n\n360\n00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:19.130\nWe have more good demos coming your way\nbut for this episode, I'll go ahead and\n\n361\n00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.931\nsign off as your Cherokee Boose\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n362\n00:18:22.931 --> 00:18:26.264\n&gt;&gt; See you next time\nhere at Cyber Patriot.\n\n363\n00:18:26.264 --> 00:18:32.255\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n364\n00:18:32.255 --> 00:18:35.122\n&gt;&gt;

Welcome back, cyber patriots.\n\n5\n00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:18.355\nBut you've made it to part three,\nso I am your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:22.155\nAnd let's go ahead and\ntake a look here at some more basic\n\n7\n00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.795\nWindows tools that we have\nsecurity tools integrated.\n\n8\n00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:29.890\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe will be looking at Firewall settings.\n\n9\n00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.590\nTo go ahead and demo that for us today\nwe have Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n10\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.350\nThank you for joining us today Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.700\n&gt;&gt; Let's get right into it, I guess.\n\n12\n00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.890\n&gt;&gt; So what we have is we have my desktop.\n\n14\n00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.700\nWe're still in the Control Panel.\n\n15\n00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.850\nWe'll always be going in and\nout of the Control Panel.\n\n16\n00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.460\nAnd going to my desktop,\nas you can see, again, guess what?\n\n17\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.190\nYou wouldn't look under F for firewall.\n\n18\n00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.140\nYou would look under Windows Firewall.\n\n19\n00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.380\nAnd it's right over here, and\nso I'm going to click on it.\n\n20\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.710\nAnd red, red's not good, right?\n\n21\n00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.290\nWe learned that early on in the ballgame.\n\n22\n00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.670\nAnd so, what this probably means is\nthat I have, well I haven't, but\n\n23\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.440\nthe machine that I'm walking into here,\nhas the firewall turned off.\n\n24\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.270\nAnd so probably, the first thing\nI would want to do is turn it on.\n\n25\n00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.880\nAnd you go over here,\nand I click right here.\n\n26\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.130\nAnd this gives me the option\nto turn it on and\n\n27\n00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.550\nso real simple I'll\nclick this radio button.\n\n28\n00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.195\nThat turned on the Windows Firewall for\nhome and work networks.\n\n29\n00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:40.405\nAnd we would characterize those as\nyour home or your work, basically.\n\n30\n00:01:40.405 --> 00:01:45.905\nThis is not in a public area, and so we\nwould probably want the Firewall on there,\n\n31\n00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:49.005\nbut we would really want it\non when we're at a Starbucks.\n\n32\n00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:49.525\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n33\n00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:53.655\nSo always when we're on public networks,\nthat's going to be the most restrictive\n\n34\n00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:57.445\nthat we want our Firewall settings\nto be in a public network setting.\n\n35\n00:01:57.445 --> 00:01:58.435\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n36\n00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:01.365\nSo I'm going to turn that on\nby clicking this radio button.\n\n37\n00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.730\nAnd now we have the firewall on.\n\n38\n00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.030\nAnd we can\n&gt;&gt; Wow [LAUGH] Look at that.\n\n39\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.990\n&gt;&gt; Everything turns to green.\n\n40\n00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.900\nAnd green is a good color.\n\n41\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.788\nAnd so what we need to do\nrelative to this is, go through,\n\n42\n00:02:16.788 --> 00:02:20.769\nthere is a whole series of\nslides that we gonna go through.\n\n43\n00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.810\nAnd I'll show you what bounce back to me.\n\n44\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.330\nWhen we go through these\nslides where you would\n\n45\n00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.070\nreach what you need to reach to do certain\nactivities relating to the firewall.\n\n46\n00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.900\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look.\n\n47\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.730\nOn this first slide that we have here,\nthis is just going to be\n\n48\n00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.530\nintroducing you to this concept of\na firewall like Steve just showed us,\n\n49\n00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.180\nour host-based firewall for our Windows\noperating system called Windows Firewall.\n\n50\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.230\nWe always want to make sure\nour firewalls are turned on.\n\n51\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.325\nSteve, would there ever be an appropriate\ntime to disable that firewall?\n\n52\n00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:58.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\nYeah,\n\n53\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.520\nif you've got other mechanisms\ntaking care of that.\n\n54\n00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.700\nOr if you need to have parts of it open.\n\n55\n00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.740\nOr you need to, a real good example\nof where you would need to have it\n\n56\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.960\nturned off is if you were doing a quick\ncheck for network connectivity.\n\n57\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.740\nBecause one of the things-\n&gt;&gt; So troubleshooting.\n\n58\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, troubleshooting.\n\n59\n00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.100\nSo for example, we use a tool out\nthere in networking called ping.\n\n60\n00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.900\nPing is a.\n\n61\n00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.310\nFor lack of a-\n&gt;&gt; Communication test.\n\n62\n00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's part of a TCP/IP\nsweep where we're going and\n\n63\n00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.400\nwe're pinging another machine to\nidentify that we can reach it.\n\n64\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.160\nThe challenge is with, and\nthis is a real challenge initially when\n\n65\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.050\nwe brough on these firewalls,\nthat the ping response is turned off.\n\n66\n00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.610\nAnd so\nmy machine here in its current setting.\n\n67\n00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.770\nIf you wanted to reach it in to\nmake sure you could talk to it.\n\n68\n00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.670\nYou would ping it and it wouldn't answer.\n\n69\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.690\nYour ping would arrive here but\n\n70\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.420\nmy machine with a firewall on is\ninstructed not to respond by replying.\n\n71\n00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.570\nAnd so, if you wanna really do a quick\ncheck to make sure you can talk back and\n\n72\n00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.800\nforth, that's what you'd do.\n\n73\n00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.750\n&gt;&gt; But then you would quickly\nturn it back on, right?\n\n74\n00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so overall, generally speaking,\n\n75\n00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.970\nwe're gonna keep our firewalls on unless\nwe're doing some kind of troubleshooting\n\n76\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.200\nAnd also, you might need to go ahead and\ntemporarily disable it if\n\n77\n00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.550\nyou're installing any kind of anti-malware\nsometimes that would conflict.\n\n78\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.570\nBut as soon as you get\nyour piece of software,\n\n79\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.318\nyour trouble shooting complete,\nturn that bad boy back on.\n\n80\n00:04:29.318 --> 00:04:31.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\n\n81\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nif you look at my screen here again.\n\n82\n00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.000\nWe're talking about firewalls and\nit shows you exactly where to go ahead and\n\n83\n00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.310\nget that like Steve had showed\nus under control panel.\n\n84\n00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.060\nAnd you can also get there by\ncategory view under System and\n\n85\n00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.980\nSecurity, Action Center.\n\n86\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.300\nAnd then turn on now.\n\n87\n00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.860\nSo, moving ahead.\n\n88\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.160\nWe have our\nWindows Firewall Custom Settings.\n\n89\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.700\nAnd we have that basic screen that we just\nlooked at with those radio buttons that\n\n90\n00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.050\nSteve had modified.\n\n91\n00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.930\nBut if we want a more granular approach.\n\n92\n00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.820\nWe could go into Advanced Settings\nif we choose to do so, so\n\n93\n00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.350\nthat's what they're showing us here.\n\n94\n00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.560\nAnd where we would find that over\non the left hand side here, so\n\n95\n00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.400\nwe can go ahead and\ncreate customized settings there.\n\n96\n00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.090\nMoving forward,\nwe also see Firewall Exceptions.\n\n97\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.520\nSo again, with Advanced Firewall,\nyou can go ahead and\n\n98\n00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.450\nlook at some of those exceptions.\n\n99\n00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.260\nMaybe I wanna go ahead and\nturn on that pinging function.\n\n100\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.050\nBut I still want other areas\nof my system on lockdown.\n\n101\n00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.400\nSo, I can really go in and\ntweak those individually.\n\n102\n00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.900\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n103\n00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.430\n&gt;&gt; And here,\nwe see a list of some common exceptions.\n\n104\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.540\nHere we have core networking.\n\n105\n00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.280\nRegular Microsoft Windows services\nthat retrieve data from the Internet.\n\n106\n00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.580\nIf you don't enable this exception\nacross all three types of networks,\n\n107\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.810\nlike you Steve had shown us with our home,\nour public and our work.\n\n108\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.572\nDifferent versions of operating\nsystems kind of label them a little\n\n109\n00:05:52.572 --> 00:05:54.079\nbit differently as far as the names.\n\n110\n00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:56.089\nBut still the concept remains, and\n\n111\n00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:01.010\nI think they changed it to domain\ninstead of work in the newer versions.\n\n112\n00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.050\nBut if you don't enable it for\nall three, some Microsoft services and\n\n113\n00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.450\nprograms are not gonna run properly.\n\n114\n00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.660\nThen you look at File and Printer Sharing,\nwhich allows you to share the contents\n\n115\n00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.070\nof selected folders, and locally\nattached printers with other computers.\n\n116\n00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.400\nIf you want to block that feature you can.\n\n117\n00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.020\nRemote Assistance, well, maybe I don't\nwant people being able to go ahead and\n\n118\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.220\nremote into my machine.\n\n119\n00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.970\nSo I can go ahead and\nmake an exception there.\n\n120\n00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.400\nAlso, Remote Desktop, that still\nfalls under that same category of\n\n121\n00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.780\nRemote Assistance and\nRemote Connectivity there.\n\n122\n00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.450\nAnd then here, you see\nthe Universal Plug and Play framework.\n\n123\n00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.300\nIt allows devices to\nconnect automatically and\n\n124\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.580\nestablish working configurations with\nother devices on the same network.\n\n125\n00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.710\nSo, these are some common exceptions\nthat you might wanna go ahead and\n\n126\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.310\ntake a look at.\n\n127\n00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.820\nTo see if it's essential\nto your environment.\n\n128\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.610\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nlet's go back to my machine.\n\n129\n00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.920\nAnd when we were talking\nabout the Advanced Settings,\n\n130\n00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.010\nit's actually here where you would click.\n\n131\n00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.440\nAnd it brings up the Advanced Settings.\n\n132\n00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.610\nOne thing I wanna mention about firewall\nrules is we have two directions.\n\n133\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.760\nWe have information data\ncoming in to this machine.\n\n134\n00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.400\nAnd we have information\ndata leaving this machine.\n\n135\n00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.380\nAnd so we have inbound rules and\noutbound rules.\n\n136\n00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.080\nAnd this is where you would go through and\n\n137\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.840\nidentify the rules that are currently\nset up for this machine.\n\n138\n00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.780\nYou can see-\n&gt;&gt; So over on the left hand side, Steve,\n\n139\n00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.250\nyou just clicked on inbound.\n\n140\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.980\nWe have two separate categories for\nthe inbound and outbound.\n\n141\n00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.630\nSo if I wanted to completely\nblock all sorts of traffic for\n\n142\n00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.380\nboth inbound and outbound,\nI wouldn't just set one rule.\n\n143\n00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.680\nI would essentially be setting two rules.\n\n144\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n145\n00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.250\n&gt;&gt; So and here we have the list\nof current existing rules\n\n146\n00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.520\nthat relate to outbound\ntraffic leaving this machine.\n\n147\n00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.870\nAnd if we want to configure a rule.\n\n148\n00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.816\nA specific rule for some sort of\ntraffic to pass either in or out.\n\n149\n00:07:55.816 --> 00:07:58.620\nWe would go to the inbound or outbound.\n\n150\n00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.720\nWe would click here on actions.\n\n151\n00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.210\nAnd we would click new rule.\n\n152\n00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.980\nAnd this is where we can actually\ngo through and set up rules.\n\n153\n00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.100\nAnd I'm not gonna go through and\nreal down for this.\n\n154\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.870\nNormally you won't, any recompetition\nactually probably have to do that.\n\n155\n00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.820\nBut if we were opening a port for\nexample, we would click here on Port and\n\n156\n00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.940\nwe would define a rule associated\nwith opening that port.\n\n157\n00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.270\n&gt;&gt; And blocking traffic perhaps coming\nover that port especially if it was\n\n158\n00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.070\na port that's normally associated\nwith an unsecure protocol.\n\n159\n00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.490\nWe'll say look, we don't even\nwanna open that back door here.\n\n160\n00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.280\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nyou can view ports as basically doors.\n\n161\n00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.569\nThat's a good way to view them.\n\n162\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.320\nAnd that is traffic that is\nattempting to enter this machine.\n\n163\n00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.910\nIf we're talking about an inbound rule,\nwe wouldn't want to,\n\n164\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.570\nif we want that traffic to come in,\nwe would open that particular port.\n\n165\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:56.644\nSo that kind of gives you a sense\nof firewall configurations.\n\n166\n00:08:56.644 --> 00:09:01.347\nAgain, in your actual competition you\nmight be required to open a port,\n\n167\n00:09:01.347 --> 00:09:02.283\nfor example.\n\n168\n00:09:02.283 --> 00:09:06.820\nOr to block a port, more likely\nbecause we're talking defensive.\n\n169\n00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.660\nGuess what, it's gonna be blocking a port.\n\n170\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:16.250\n&gt;&gt; The last thing we had on this\nlist here was Windows Updates.\n\n171\n00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.630\nNow if you guys recall\non the last episode,\n\n172\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.350\nwe looked at our action center and\nit had red.\n\n173\n00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.980\nIt looked like it was bleeding.\n\n174\n00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.240\nWe've made a few tweaks.\n\n175\n00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.140\nBut let's also show you where we\ncan look for any Windows updates.\n\n176\n00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.540\nYou probably have seen that or\nhad some experience with that already.\n\n177\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.935\nBut it's definitely something we want\nto know where you can go ahead and\n\n178\n00:09:37.935 --> 00:09:39.040\nconfigure that.\n\n179\n00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.995\n&gt;&gt; And guess where we would\nfind how to get there?\n\n180\n00:09:40.995 --> 00:09:43.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think we'll go to the control panel,\n\n181\n00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.520\nso let's go to my window, again.\n\n182\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.420\nAnd it's not just update,\nit's a Windows update.\n\n183\n00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.900\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n184\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.830\nhere I'm going to click on it and red.\n\n185\n00:09:54.830 --> 00:10:00.790\nAnd I wonder why we have red because\nit's said that check for updates.\n\n186\n00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.660\nAlways install latest updates,\nthey're telling us to do this.\n\n187\n00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.190\nAnd but that red means that we're\nprobably not really checking.\n\n188\n00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.320\n&gt;&gt; As up to date as we should be, yeah.\n\n189\n00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so we could go here and\nwe could click to check for updates.\n\n190\n00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.730\nAnd I'm not gonna do that,\nbecause I'm gonna go in here and\n\n191\n00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:18.990\nI'm gonna change the settings.\n\n192\n00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.290\nBecause I don't want to [LAUGH].\n\n193\n00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:28.240\nThis machine is probably so far back there\nthat it would take a day to update it\n\n194\n00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.190\nrelative to its service packs and stuff.\n\n195\n00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.040\n&gt;&gt; And you know what?\n\n196\n00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.190\nLet's say I'm in a business environment.\n\n197\n00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.200\nAnd if that happens to me while I'm\nworking, and I have a deadline, and\n\n198\n00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.260\nI need to get my job finished\nbefore a certain time,\n\n199\n00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.170\nthat's why you set it at this,\nthey give you options.\n\n200\n00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.730\nSo go ahead and\nset it up in different ways.\n\n201\n00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.200\nSo you know what?\nLets go ahead and\n\n202\n00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.780\ncheck and\ninstall updates after business hours so\n\n203\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.200\nthat I don't have this,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n204\n00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:50.740\n&gt;&gt; Problems.\n\n205\n00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.480\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; And of course you can see down here\n\n206\n00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.660\nis they say, how often should we check and\nthis is set for\n\n207\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.470\nevery day and is set by default,\nthis is the default setting for 3 AM.\n\n208\n00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.960\nThe rushing up for 3 AM is,\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully you are sleeping.\n\n209\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hopefully I am sleeping,\nnow there are times I'm not.\n\n210\n00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:12.270\nAnd what we need to do and\nit used to be a real issue\n\n211\n00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.295\nthan this is kind gone away with windows\nten to be quite honest with you.\n\n212\n00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:19.602\nWe've been forced to get used\nto automatically updating and\n\n213\n00:11:19.602 --> 00:11:24.360\nin essence what happens is that\nwindows ten taking care of updating.\n\n214\n00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.470\nIt's kinda more or\n\n215\n00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.150\nless doing its own thing,\nwhich is rather disturbing sometimes.\n\n216\n00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.030\n&gt;&gt; It's very different.\n\n217\n00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.268\nYes, the way that the update\nhappens is different [LAUGH].\n\n218\n00:11:33.268 --> 00:11:37.957\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but this is Windows 7 and\nI have a variety of choices.\n\n219\n00:11:37.957 --> 00:11:43.040\nIt says install updates automatically,\nand that's the recommended approach.\n\n220\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.421\nAgain, it's going to install\nthem hopefully at 3 AM.\n\n221\n00:11:46.421 --> 00:11:50.712\nAnd it's gonna check, and then if there\nare updates there, it will download them,\n\n222\n00:11:50.712 --> 00:11:53.840\nand hopefully install while I'm sleeping.\n\n223\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.650\nAnd part of the reason relative to\nthe challenge associated with updating is\n\n224\n00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.810\nit shouldn't be this way.\n\n225\n00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.320\nIt shouldn't be this way, if Microsoft\nhad a better operating system design.\n\n226\n00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.700\nBut restarts are often required and\nso, you've got a Word file up there\n\n227\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.840\nthat you have not saved or some other\ndocument up there that you haven't saved.\n\n228\n00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.010\nAnd the worse thing that could\nhappen to you is a restart.\n\n229\n00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.120\nSo I guess the lesson there is\nalways save your documents.\n\n230\n00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.380\nPeriodically while you're using them,\nwhile you're creating data.\n\n231\n00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.120\nSo, it's install updates automatically.\n\n232\n00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.500\nCould install at three\no'clock in the morning,\n\n233\n00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.850\ncould be a shutdown and a restart.\n\n234\n00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.550\nI walk in,\nI expect to see a document there and\n\n235\n00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.010\nI'm surprised that it's not there\nbecause the program shut down.\n\n236\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.371\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you are in a corporate\nenvironment, your system or\n\n237\n00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:44.609\nnetwork admin will go ahead and\nlet you know about these.\n\n238\n00:12:44.609 --> 00:12:48.904\nBecause in a business environment they're\nnormally having updates server setups so\n\n239\n00:12:48.904 --> 00:12:52.303\nthat they can really control what\nupdate their system are getting,\n\n240\n00:12:52.303 --> 00:12:53.810\nwhen they're getting them.\n\n241\n00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.310\nYou don't really need to worry\nabout that now, but moving forward,\n\n242\n00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.910\njust know that there are other\noptions out there for you.\n\n243\n00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.750\n&gt;&gt; And so, we have update automatically,\nthe one below that\n\n244\n00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.950\nis download the updates, but\nlet me choose to install them.\n\n245\n00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.420\nAnd that is historically been the setting\nin a Windows 7 environment that\n\n246\n00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.970\nI would use.\n\n247\n00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Gives you a little more control.\n\n248\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because bring them down\n&gt;&gt; And let me pick and choose.\n\n249\n00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.750\n&gt;&gt; And tell me that they're there, and\n\n250\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.970\nthen I will pick the time\nthat I want them installed.\n\n251\n00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.040\nThat way you can more or\nless supervise the install too and\n\n252\n00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:31.250\nmake a decision as to whether or\nnot you want this particular update.\n\n253\n00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it might not even be relevant\nto your machine and it's not something\n\n254\n00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.730\nyou even need, so hey, why are we\ngoing to go ahead and install it.\n\n255\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.470\n&gt;&gt; Right and the next one is,\ncheck for updates.\n\n256\n00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.830\nBut let me choose whether to download and\ninstall them.\n\n257\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.215\nAnd this might be in a situation where you\ndon't have bandwidth at your location.\n\n258\n00:13:46.215 --> 00:13:47.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n259\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.560\n&gt;&gt; And so, I don't have bandwidth at home\nbut I can take my laptop to school and\n\n260\n00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:56.140\nthey've got a big pipe, and so\nI'm gonna do my updates there.\n\n261\n00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.440\nI'm on a modem or something at home.\n\n262\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.510\nAnd I know that there\nare students up there and\n\n263\n00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:05.160\nthis was the one that we are currently set\nat and it says never check for update.\n\n264\n00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:05.993\nNot recommended.\n\n265\n00:14:05.993 --> 00:14:07.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not recommended.\n\n266\n00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.950\n&gt;&gt; So what I'm gonna do because I don't\nwant the actual updates to happen, is I'm\n\n267\n00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.980\ngonna set this intermediate sort of one\nwhere it says check it through out there.\n\n268\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.200\nBut I get to choose to download them.\n\n269\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.630\nBecause I don't want it\nto be busy doing things.\n\n270\n00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.460\n&gt;&gt; That should have helped\nsome of our issues.\n\n271\n00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.360\nMaybe we can hop back on\nover to Action Center and\n\n272\n00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.125\nsee what our report card looks like now.\n\n273\n00:14:27.125 --> 00:14:27.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n274\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.980\nso, now it's-\n&gt;&gt; Are we stock here?\n\n275\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:31.910\n&gt;&gt; No we're not stock.\n\n276\n00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Oops, it's checking for\n\n277\n00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.980\nupdates I don't want it to do that,\nbut it will do it on the side.\n\n278\n00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.730\nSo now we go back into the Action Center,\nand we see how we're doing?\n\n279\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we've been improved slightly,\n\n280\n00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.490\nit looks like we do have some room for\nimprovement.\n\n281\n00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.950\nBut I think once our updates complete\nthat will also help the situation.\n\n282\n00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that,\nremember we did not update Defender.\n\n283\n00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's another reason, yeah.\n\n284\n00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.040\n&gt;&gt; And so, that's probably why were, yeah.\n\n285\n00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.750\n&gt;&gt; So you guys would just go through the\nmotions until you got to that acceptable\n\n286\n00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.350\nlevel and it would show you green.\n\n287\n00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.130\nGreen is good.\n\n288\n00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:03.790\n&gt;&gt; Green is good.\n\n289\n00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We don't have the updates for Windows.\n\n290\n00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.170\nAnd we haven't gone through and\nset up backup.\n\n291\n00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:11.380\nI'm not sure I would.\n\n292\n00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.340\nI think I'd use a third party\nproduct to be quite honest with you.\n\n293\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.270\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; I think I've said that a number\n\n294\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.180\nof times so\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n295\n00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.550\nI think that that's a good start here.\n\n296\n00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.590\nWe can go through each\none of these areas and\n\n297\n00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.610\nsee where we need to pay attention\nto keep our machines healthy.\n\n298\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.880\nAnd this is all part of that\nhardening process that you'll\n\n299\n00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.910\nhear us talk about if you haven't already.\n\n300\n00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.080\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\ncall it a day for this particular episode.\n\n301\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.750\nBut we still have more information headed\nyour way, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n302\n00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.530\nsign off for this particular show.\n\n303\n00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.490\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n304\n00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.070\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.645\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, cyber patriots,\nto another online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:14.645 --> 00:00:17.700\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.350\nThis is a part two for account management.\n\n7\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.066\nAnd with us today,\nwe have Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n8\n00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.246\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and take a look\nat some more demos to go ahead and\n\n9\n00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:27.637\nexplain to you some account\nmanagement techniques.\n\n10\n00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:29.820\nSo, thank you for joining us today Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.880\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you for inviting me.\n\n12\n00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.740\nBefore we go over into account management,\n\n13\n00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.270\nI wanted to explain a couple of things\nthat happened at the last video.\n\n14\n00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.610\nWe're dealing with Windows, and\nWindows is an interesting product.\n\n15\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.102\nIf it were an airplane,\nI don't think I'd wanna be on it.\n\n16\n00:00:45.102 --> 00:00:46.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know about you other people,\n\n17\n00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.330\n[LAUGH] but it's Windows.\n\n18\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.290\nAnd Windows has a tendency, periodically,\n\n19\n00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.650\nto do unexplained things\nthat we can't understand.\n\n20\n00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.870\nAnd often times, frankly, when it acts or\n\n21\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.820\nmisbehaves in a fashion where you can't\nfigure it out, it's best just to re image.\n\n22\n00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.764\nSo, that doesn't affect what I did over\nthe break, is I re-imaged and brought up\n\n23\n00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:10.310\na new Windows 7 in an environment,\nin the VMware player environment.\n\n24\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.360\nSo hopefully,\nthis version will perform much better,\n\n25\n00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.280\nrather than giving you that circle\nthing that just keeps going on and\n\n26\n00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.840\non, and\nyou can't do anything with your mouse.\n\n27\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.350\nAnd it's just a challenge.\n\n28\n00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.730\nSo, let's cut over to my window,\nto my desktop.\n\n29\n00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.170\nAnd you can see where I am.\n\n30\n00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.920\nI'm in local users and groups.\n\n31\n00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.380\nThis is in computer management.\n\n32\n00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.360\nThe way you access,\n\n33\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.860\nif you go into Administrative Tools,\nthere are other ways to do this, but\n\n34\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.080\nyou go Administrative Tools, and\nthen click on Computer Management.\n\n35\n00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.440\nAnd you'll get this screen up, and\nyou'll highlight Users and Groups.\n\n36\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.700\nAnd then over here on the right pane,\n\n37\n00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.620\nyou get folders that represent\nthe folders of all the users.\n\n38\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.529\nAnd as you can see,\nthis is somewhat scaled down,\n\n39\n00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:49.131\nbecause it's a brand new installation.\n\n40\n00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:52.883\nI'm there, the guest account is there, and\n\n41\n00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:57.853\nthe administrator account is there, and-\n&gt;&gt; So, any kind of user that you\n\n42\n00:01:57.853 --> 00:02:02.039\ncreate automatically there's a folder\npropagated and it would be placed there?\n\n43\n00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.559\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n44\n00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:04.179\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n45\n00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.247\n&gt;&gt; And one of the things that happens here\nis if you look at the user, fortunately,\n\n46\n00:02:08.247 --> 00:02:11.370\nit's so small you can't see\nthat I even misspelled my name.\n\n47\n00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.330\nIt's S-E-D-E there.\n\n48\n00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.858\nBut I was doing this in kind of a hurry,\nand if I wanted to add another user,\n\n49\n00:02:17.858 --> 00:02:21.946\nyou can right click over on this side,\nand it click on new user, and\n\n50\n00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:23.503\nwe would do C-H-E-R.\n\n51\n00:02:23.503 --> 00:02:24.269\n&gt;&gt; O-K.\n\n52\n00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.711\n&gt;&gt; O-K-E-E.\n\n53\n00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:26.313\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n54\n00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:31.030\n&gt;&gt; I could put in full name, and probably\nshould if this were a real environment.\n\n55\n00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.450\nI could assign Cherokee a password,\nso we'll do,\n\n56\n00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.119\nhow about a simple one\nlike P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D?\n\n57\n00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.654\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n58\n00:02:38.654 --> 00:02:45.320\n&gt;&gt; And I could confirm it P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D,\nand I would keep this checked typically.\n\n59\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.840\nThis top box here says user must\nchange password on next login, so.\n\n60\n00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, so I couldn't blame you for\nknowing my password.\n\n61\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.860\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, you're gonna get\nan opportunity to type in password as\n\n62\n00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.090\nyour old password, and then you'll type\nin a new password and confirm it, and\n\n63\n00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.130\nthat will become your password.\n\n64\n00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.470\nSo, it's really that simple\nsetting up a user, and\n\n65\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.550\nso I will close that, so\nnow we should have a Cherokee,\n\n66\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.956\nyou could see she is right there,\nfull name is Cherokee.\n\n67\n00:03:15.956 --> 00:03:17.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I didn't put anything in it,\n\n68\n00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.840\njust adopted the user account name.\n\n69\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.410\nAnd so what I'm gonna do is, incidentally,\nyou will noticed that the next to\n\n70\n00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.220\nAdministrator and Guest,\nwe have built in accounts, and we had\n\n71\n00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.490\ntalked about this earlier, but this guest\naccount, if we got to properties on it,\n\n72\n00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.030\nprobably one of the things that I'm gonna\ndo is check to make sure it's disabled.\n\n73\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.390\nYou can see here that it is.\n\n74\n00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.930\nSo, if this were a competition,\nthat is probably where I would go, and\n\n75\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.020\nI would check that box.\n\n76\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n77\n00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.810\nanother thing that you can do in effect\nto safeguard these sorts of accounts\n\n78\n00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.220\nis that you could actually\ngive it a different password,\n\n79\n00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.630\nand you know something really challenging,\nif that's necessary.\n\n80\n00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.870\nNow, Microsoft has probably\nalready done that.\n\n81\n00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.520\nBut you wanna make sure that nobody\nwill be able to login to this account\n\n82\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.510\nin a secure environment\nwhere it's not necessary.\n\n83\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.080\nNow, there are instances,\nmaybe, where it is necessary.\n\n84\n00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.100\nBut I'm gonna leave it\nexactly as it is here.\n\n85\n00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.520\nAnd then we get over to Groups,\nand in Groups, we have,\n\n86\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.420\nas I mentioned in our last video,\nwe have a whole bunch of them.\n\n87\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.240\nCherokee wants to be an administrator,\nso I can click her on administrator, and\n\n88\n00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.910\nI can add her.\n\n89\n00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.960\nAnd I can-\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Steve.\n\n90\n00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, I haven't added you yet.\n\n91\n00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, [LAUGH].\n\n92\n00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.390\n&gt;&gt; It necessitates to,\ntry to type in her name.\n\n93\n00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.542\nOkay, and check names.\n\n94\n00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:45.920\nSo, we'll check names, and there she is.\n\n95\n00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.970\nNow, I could do it there,\nbut I'm not going to.\n\n96\n00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.860\nWhat I'm gonna do is go\nback to the User folder.\n\n97\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.560\nAnd we can go to Cherokee, and we can\nlook at her, and we can say member of.\n\n98\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.490\nWe can also put her in in this fashion.\n\n99\n00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.520\nWe could go here as to member of.\n\n100\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.590\n&gt;&gt; So, this list will display\nany groups that I am a part of?\n\n101\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.550\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n102\n00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.032\n&gt;&gt; So, I go A-D-M-I-N-S-T-R,\n\n103\n00:05:12.032 --> 00:05:17.480\nI hope I am spelling administrator,\nif I spelled it right.\n\n104\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.120\nIt should be there.\n\n105\n00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.720\nDid I spell it right?\n\n106\n00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.175\n&gt;&gt; I did not wear my glasses either.\n\n107\n00:05:22.175 --> 00:05:23.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a problem when you're not\n\n108\n00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.630\nwearing your glasses.\n\n109\n00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.660\n&gt;&gt; It's not letting me.\n\n110\n00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.270\nSo, I probably spelled it wrong.\n\n111\n00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.087\nLet me try it again here.\n\n112\n00:05:29.087 --> 00:05:36.481\nAD, I think I can see\nA-D-M-I-N-I-S-T-R-A-T-O-R.\n\n113\n00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:38.408\n&gt;&gt; AT, I think that's right.\n\n114\n00:05:38.408 --> 00:05:40.820\n&gt;&gt; Or administrators, I think, yes.\n\n115\n00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.390\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n116\n00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.600\n&gt;&gt; Gotta have that s on there, so-\n&gt;&gt; And that's why using,\n\n117\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.050\nlike you did, that first example.\n\n118\n00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.720\nIf you ever see that, guys, and\ngals out there, and it says check names.\n\n119\n00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.630\nWhenever it becomes underscored, then\nyou know it's a preexisting group there.\n\n120\n00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.905\nSo, it's not a typo or anything.\n\n121\n00:05:57.905 --> 00:05:59.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so basically,\n\n122\n00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.470\nwhat I have done is I've gone through and\napplied and put her in various groups.\n\n123\n00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.710\nNow, she's an administrator.\n\n124\n00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.140\nThat's a god-like role, but again,\ngoing back here to groups, we have for\n\n125\n00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.410\nexample back-up operators.\n\n126\n00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.160\nAnd we could put, let's say we had\na third-party in here that we wanted, but\n\n127\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.635\nwe didn't want them to be\na full administrator, we just.\n\n128\n00:06:19.635 --> 00:06:22.790\nTheir job is a backup operator, and\n\n129\n00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.590\nwhen you think of when backups are done,\noftentimes, that's after hours.\n\n130\n00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.490\nSo, that maybe somebody who's on duty\nafter hours, and they're just an ordinary\n\n131\n00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.740\nuser, but you're adding this\nsupplemental responsibility to them.\n\n132\n00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.157\n&gt;&gt; So you wanna delegate some work, but\n\n133\n00:06:36.157 --> 00:06:38.913\nyou don't wanna give them that full\ncontrol the administrators have.\n\n134\n00:06:38.913 --> 00:06:40.946\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and again,\n\n135\n00:06:40.946 --> 00:06:46.189\nit comes down to the sort of\njobs that you want people to do,\n\n136\n00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:51.218\nyou want them to do,\nbecause that's part of their job.\n\n137\n00:06:51.218 --> 00:06:53.959\nYou don't want to give them\nmore responsibility than-\n\n138\n00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:55.389\n&gt;&gt; Going back to that principle of least\n\n139\n00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:56.640\nprivilege that we spoke about.\n\n140\n00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.080\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and with groups,\nyou can set up your own sort of groups.\n\n141\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:08.030\nNew group, and we'll call this the,\nI don't know, newpeople.\n\n142\n00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.600\nOr one thing,\nwhere it makes sense to do this, and\n\n143\n00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.990\nlet me give you an example\nfrom a business standpoint.\n\n144\n00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.047\nLet's say contractors.\n\n145\n00:07:17.085 --> 00:07:21.987\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we normally organize also\nby departments too, if we had a sales or\n\n146\n00:07:21.987 --> 00:07:27.060\nmarketing department, you'd see those\ntypes of groups being created a lot.\n\n147\n00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.433\n&gt;&gt; Right, let me go through here.\n\n148\n00:07:29.778 --> 00:07:31.950\nCreate contractors.\n\n149\n00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.020\nOkay, I created a group\ncalled contractors.\n\n150\n00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.680\nThey're somewhere in here under\nthese groups, if I can find them.\n\n151\n00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.670\nThey're right there, as you can see.\n\n152\n00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.620\nNow, who would I put into\na contractor's group?\n\n153\n00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.070\nBecause oftentimes, and this is gonna go\ninto the next discussion we're gonna have,\n\n154\n00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.440\nwhich is on permissions.\n\n155\n00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.150\nIt may be that in this group,\nwe put people who are contractors,\n\n156\n00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.290\nmeaning that they're not employees of\nthe business, but they're contractors.\n\n157\n00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.960\nAnd what we would do is, we might have\na folder that has the employee manual.\n\n158\n00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.130\nWell, we wouldn't want contractors,\nfor example,\n\n159\n00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.260\nto have access to the employee manual,\nbecause they're not employees.\n\n160\n00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.280\nThat may be evidence that\nthey are employees, and\n\n161\n00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.590\nsometimes you don't want that.\n\n162\n00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.700\nSo, you can go through this\nwhole thing and create groups,\n\n163\n00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:18.410\nput people into the roles or relationships\nthat they have with the entity.\n\n164\n00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.790\nSo, does that kinda make sense?\n\n165\n00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it gives you your access.\n\n166\n00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.980\nYou can go ahead and restrict access\naccordingly if it is a role, or\n\n167\n00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:30.220\nan employee or vendor or any kind of\npartner, or really any kind of employee.\n\n168\n00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.500\nBecause, like we said before, not all\nemployees have the same level of access.\n\n169\n00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.270\nSo that's one way of\nimplementing that technique.\n\n170\n00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, so I think that that pretty\nwell sums up what I wanted to say.\n\n171\n00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.650\nAnd now that my machine is working well,\nand I can show these sorts of things-\n\n172\n00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:45.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so,\n\n173\n00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.070\nit happens sometimes in technology.\n\n174\n00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.320\nIt may happen to you.\n\n175\n00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.470\nIt probably will happen to you as well,\nso don't let that get you down.\n\n176\n00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.150\nJust keep on tracking.\n\n177\n00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.330\nAnd thank you for watching, we're gonna go\nahead and wrap up this particular episode,\n\n178\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.470\nso, see you next time here for\ncyber patriot.\n\n179\n00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.110\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n180\n00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.010\n&gt;&gt;

Hi everybody.\n\n11\n00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.470\nAnd this is gonna be an interesting,\nlike the last module,\n\n12\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.600\nan interesting module for you.\n\n13\n00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.020\n&gt;&gt; And the first thing I want to\ndo is to show you some pictures.\n\n14\n00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.830\nAnd first of all I'll tell\nyou that the pictures are of\n\n15\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.450\nan event that took place October 15th.\n\n16\n00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.860\nAnd it was the practice event before\nthe actual form of competition\n\n17\n00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.840\nround start in October we\nhave a practice round.\n\n18\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.820\nAnd what I did was I invited students\nfrom throughout my region and\n\n19\n00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.705\ntheir coaches to come and\nparticipate in the practice event.\n\n20\n00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:07.030\nIt's really great to do it that way\nbecause kids need to meet kids from\n\n21\n00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.290\nother high schools and middle schools and\nthe coaches who are teachers typically,\n\n22\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.050\nget to meet each other and so it's a time\nto bond, and a time just to have fun.\n\n23\n00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.800\nSo let's go to my screen where\nI've got these pictures up.\n\n24\n00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.280\nYou can see the first one the only\nreason I have it up there,\n\n25\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.050\nwell look at my beautiful campus.\n\n26\n00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.246\nThat's Sierra College.\n\n27\n00:01:25.246 --> 00:01:26.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's very pretty.\n\n28\n00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.735\n&gt;&gt; You can see the trees are starting to-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we don't see that too often in\n\n29\n00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:30.480\nFlorida.\n\n30\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.840\n&gt;&gt; We really do have that change of color.\n\n31\n00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.670\nAnd so if we go through here,\n\n32\n00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.880\nthis is a typical room where\nkids are getting started.\n\n33\n00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.670\nAnd we broke to lunch and you can see,\nit's kind of hard to see in this picture,\n\n34\n00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.330\nbut there's a big stack of pizza's.\n\n35\n00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.700\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, that's a lot of pizza.\n\n36\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a lot of pizza.\n\n37\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.495\nThat was, a matter of fact\nabout $609 worth of pizza.\n\n38\n00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:56.300\n[LAUGH] I managed to be able to supply for\nthis event.\n\n39\n00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.910\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n40\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.510\nthey're all going through, a big long\nline of kids going through eating pizza.\n\n41\n00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.280\nOne thing about it if you supply\nfood then middle school and\n\n42\n00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.750\nhigh school students, it just draws them.\n\n43\n00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.730\n&gt;&gt; Well you know what, my boss actually\nsaid that to me earlier today.\n\n44\n00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.670\nAbout volunteering for an activity.\n\n45\n00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.100\nSo it works for adults too.\n\n46\n00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.648\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n47\n00:02:15.648 --> 00:02:16.228\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n48\n00:02:16.228 --> 00:02:17.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just bring the food.\n\n49\n00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.200\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n50\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.070\n&gt;&gt; And incidentally, that previous one,\nI don't know whether you\n\n51\n00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.100\nhad a chance to see it, but\nthat's the Cyber Patriot typical t-shirt.\n\n52\n00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.080\nAnd there's somebody in\na red shirt taking pictures.\n\n53\n00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.080\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I recognize him.\n\n54\n00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.610\nYeah.\n\n55\n00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.260\n&gt;&gt; At the event.\n\n56\n00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.400\nAnd as I said,\nwe had quite a sizeable crowd.\n\n57\n00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.490\nWe had about, I think it was probably\nabout 150 people at this event.\n\n58\n00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.590\nJust to give you some sense.\n\n59\n00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.651\nAnd that isn't the best\npizza in the world.\n\n60\n00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:43.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you know at that price,\n\n61\n00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.200\n&gt;&gt; It's pizza.\n\n62\n00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.810\n&gt;&gt; Pizza is pizza.\n\n63\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.370\n&gt;&gt; I don't think there is a bad pizza.\n\n64\n00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.920\n&gt;&gt; So that gives you the whole display so\nlet's go on to where we need to go.\n\n65\n00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.450\n&gt;&gt; Sure,\nlet's take a look at my screen and\n\n66\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.670\nlook at some of our learning objectives.\n\n67\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.340\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nAnd so,\n\n68\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.110\nhere are our learning objectives for\nthis particular module.\n\n69\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.710\nAs you can see here, we're gonna look\nat implementing proper file level and\n\n70\n00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.700\nfolder level permissions in Windows.\n\n71\n00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.630\nBasically, what we're doing is we're\ncontrolling access to files and folders.\n\n72\n00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.120\nAnd then what you can do with\nthose files and folders.\n\n73\n00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.720\nWe're going to understand\nhow backups function and\n\n74\n00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.410\nbest practices for backup strategies.\n\n75\n00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.910\nWe're going to talk in\na more general sense,\n\n76\n00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.520\nnot specific to Microsoft backup here\nbecause as I mentioned in the past,\n\n77\n00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.420\nMicrosoft backup is a program that not\na lot of companies or entities use.\n\n78\n00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.920\nAnd we're also going to look at auditing.\n\n79\n00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.680\nThis is the A and the accounting side and\n\n80\n00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.050\nwe talked about the A's right?\n\n81\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.280\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so auditing, accounting.\n\n82\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.185\nWe're not talking about Accounting\nfrom a financial standpoint\n\n83\n00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:55.515\nyou might even wanna kinda just marry the\nterms logging, because that's what we're\n\n84\n00:03:55.515 --> 00:03:58.365\ngonna be looking at, a lot of logs,\ntoo, that historical data there.\n\n85\n00:03:58.365 --> 00:03:59.485\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n86\n00:03:59.485 --> 00:04:02.935\nwe're gonna be able to figure out\nwhat you did while you were there.\n\n87\n00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:03.725\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n88\n00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:06.240\nif you did something wrong, guess what?\n\n89\n00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.680\nWe'll know.\n\n90\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.150\nAnd as a matter of fact logs often times\nprovide evidence in court proceedings.\n\n91\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.930\nBecause if you were to do something wrong,\nlet's say you were to pull a customer list\n\n92\n00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.120\na moment before you resigned and\na customer list belongs to the company.\n\n93\n00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.120\nAnd probably when you signed on\nto join the company they had some\n\n94\n00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.490\nforms that you filled out.\n\n95\n00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.300\nOne of which might have been that you're\nnot gonna steal the customer list.\n\n96\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI worked for\n\n97\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.660\na company where any thought\nthat I had six months\n\n98\n00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.230\nafter the relationship with that company\nwas intellectual property of that company.\n\n99\n00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo you have to read the fine print, guys.\n\n100\n00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n101\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.440\nI hear you loud and clear.\n\n102\n00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.970\nSo let's go forward with the next module.\n\n103\n00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay go.\n&gt;&gt; Minus one up.\n\n104\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.000\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, yeah we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up for this segment.\n\n105\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.950\nBut stay tuned we have some really\ngreat information coming your way.\n\n106\n00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.920\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n107\n00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.860\n&gt;&gt;

Yes.\n\n21\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.323\n&gt;&gt; And I think this is where we're\nreally coming into play here for\n\n22\n00:01:05.323 --> 00:01:06.585\nour I with integrity, right?\n\n23\n00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:07.485\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; When we look\n\n24\n00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:09.040\nat our file permissions here.\n\n25\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.746\nAnd like Steve just mentioned,\n\n26\n00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:14.230\nwe wanna keep it accessible to\nthose that need that information.\n\n27\n00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.530\nWe wanna keep it out of the hands for\nthose who do not.\n\n28\n00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.862\nAnd that comes down to our A for\navailability, so that's what we're gonna\n\n29\n00:01:20.862 --> 00:01:25.469\nbe looking at here is really focusing on\nthis integrity portion as we go ahead and\n\n30\n00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:26.740\nproceed.\n\n31\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.010\nFirst we see file permissions.\n\n32\n00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.560\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n33\n00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.192\n&gt;&gt; So this is fun.\n\n34\n00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:33.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n35\n00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.400\nsomewhat complicated sometimes, because\nwhen you're trying to set up a folder\n\n36\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.420\nwhere people can access it for certain\npurposes, and yet not other purposes.\n\n37\n00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.850\nIt can get real challenging and\nbecome real granular.\n\n38\n00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.590\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you, yeah,\nif it's set up correctly, it works well.\n\n39\n00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.980\nThe hint of sarcasm came from experiences\nwhere people had not set it up correctly.\n\n40\n00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.076\nAnd that's never a good, fun time.\n\n41\n00:01:57.076 --> 00:01:58.196\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n42\n00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:01.530\n&gt;&gt; So, without further ado let's\ngo ahead and talk about it.\n\n43\n00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.530\nAnd we'll even look at the proper way\nto go ahead and use file permissions.\n\n44\n00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nAnd\n\n45\n00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.590\none thing I wanted to say about that\nto remind you and to remind me.\n\n46\n00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.440\nEvery time we set up folders and\nfiles for permissions check it out, and\n\n47\n00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.340\nmake sure that it works\nthe way you want it to work.\n\n48\n00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.910\n&gt;&gt; Good advice.\n[LAUGH]\n\n49\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.980\n&gt;&gt; Don't assume\n\n50\n00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.320\nthat it will work that way.\n\n51\n00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.210\nBecause unless you're doing\nthis on a regular basis,\n\n52\n00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.170\nand most of us are not,\nyou can easily make mistakes.\n\n53\n00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.788\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; It happens, to the best of us.\n\n54\n00:02:29.788 --> 00:02:31.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n55\n00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.064\n[LAUGH] So, let me go through,\ndo we wanna actually go through and\n\n56\n00:02:34.064 --> 00:02:35.440\nshow it on my screen?\n\n57\n00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.310\nOr should we go through the-\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at the different\n\n58\n00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.170\ntypes of permissions on\nthis slide first here.\n\n59\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.360\nSo, these are some options that you'll\nhave and Steve will go ahead and show us.\n\n60\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.840\nBut what we wanna take a look at is\nthe definition here full control, and\n\n61\n00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.410\nthis is like we were looking at\npreviously with account management your\n\n62\n00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.490\nessentially getting that full\nadministrator level access.\n\n63\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.612\nYou can go ahead and assign these rights\nbased upon that concept of principle\n\n64\n00:03:00.612 --> 00:03:05.760\nof lease privilege to let that end user\naccess what they need to access but\n\n65\n00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.341\nnot anything more than what\nthey don't need, right.\n\n66\n00:03:08.341 --> 00:03:11.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, let me make one final\ncomment while this slide is up here.\n\n67\n00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.630\nWe're talking about what's\ncalled NTFS permissions.\n\n68\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.360\nIt is as though you're logged\non locally to this machine,\n\n69\n00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.330\naccessing the folders or\nthe files from this machine.\n\n70\n00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.891\nNot to be confused with share permissions,\nand\n\n71\n00:03:24.891 --> 00:03:27.970\nI'm not sure how much we'll\ngo into share permissions.\n\n72\n00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.100\nBut they're different, they overlay and\nthey can create some real problems.\n\n73\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.400\nIf somebody were trying to reach\nthis machine from over the network-\n\n74\n00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.437\n&gt;&gt; Network mm-hm-\n\n75\n00:03:36.437 --> 00:03:37.237\n&gt;&gt; Let's say,\n\n76\n00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:41.602\nthey might be able to have full control\npermissions here in terms of NTFS\n\n77\n00:03:41.602 --> 00:03:46.560\npermissions or they might have,\nfor example, the ability to write.\n\n78\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.150\nBut if they come through the share, and\nall they're given is the right to read.\n\n79\n00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.780\nGuess what.\n\n80\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.992\nThey won't be able to write.\n\n81\n00:03:52.992 --> 00:03:54.605\nSo it gets a bit complicated.\n\n82\n00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:55.299\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n83\n00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.780\nAnd you know Microsoft actually\nrecommends to choose one or the other.\n\n84\n00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.620\nAnd Steve you mentioned NTFS, for\nthe new technology file system, and\n\n85\n00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.220\nguys just note that we are talking\nabout a Windows environment so\n\n86\n00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.010\nwhen you switch on to your Ubuntu machines\nyou're not gonna see NTFS permissions.\n\n87\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.890\nYou will see permissions, but it's just\ngonna be implemented in a different way.\n\n88\n00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.360\nBecause guess what?\n\n89\n00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.670\nNTFS permissions are tied to that NTFS\n\n90\n00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.350\nfile system that we use\nin a Windows environment.\n\n91\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.944\n&gt;&gt; And by the way, we don't use\nthe term new technology anymore-\n\n92\n00:04:24.944 --> 00:04:25.649\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:29.094\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's been around since Windows 351,\n\n94\n00:04:29.094 --> 00:04:34.906\nwhich was quite a while ago, so if we\nshorten it to NTFS just because, yeah.\n\n95\n00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:37.953\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, and like Steve mentioned for\n\n96\n00:04:37.953 --> 00:04:42.395\nthe shares being your share\npermissions are different.\n\n97\n00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:46.667\nAnd like he said one way to go ahead,\nand let's say Steve didn't like me using\n\n98\n00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:50.938\nthe color printer because well, I was\na hog and we all know how much color ink,\n\n99\n00:04:50.938 --> 00:04:53.766\nI'm sure you've heard it\nfrom someone before, so\n\n100\n00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:56.970\nSteve blocks access for\nme to print on the color printer.\n\n101\n00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.190\nWell guess what?\n\n102\n00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.810\nI'm just gonna go ahead and defy Steve.\n\n103\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.410\nAnd instead of connecting to that printer\nover the network, I go hop on that machine\n\n104\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.600\nwhere that printer is attached locally,\nnow I can print color.\n\n105\n00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.290\nSo we won't go too far\ninto depth with that.\n\n106\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.590\nJust know there are two different types.\n\n107\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.400\nBut we're going to be\nlooking at NTFS permissions.\n\n108\n00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n109\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.960\nAlright\n&gt;&gt; So lets bring back up on the screen\n\n110\n00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.900\n&gt;&gt; Yea, we have full control,\n\n111\n00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.640\nwe looked at that.\n\n112\n00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.330\nNext we have modify.\n\n113\n00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.650\nOkay modify will grant them the option to\ngo ahead and change a document, right.\n\n114\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.320\nAnd read and execute, so if it was an\nexecutable file they would have access to\n\n115\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.590\ngo ahead and do that, or they could simply\ngo ahead and read-view a document there.\n\n116\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.250\nList Folder Contents,\nnow this is gonna be a permission that's\n\n117\n00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.030\nobviously attached with\nfolder permissions.\n\n118\n00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.300\nThey're slightly different\nthan file permissions.\n\n119\n00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.770\nSo, if Steve have a top\nsuper secret folder and\n\n120\n00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.420\ninside it had all these\nimportant contents.\n\n121\n00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.790\nHe might not even want me to see\nwhat's listed inside that folder so.\n\n122\n00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.940\nYou know, that's an option we have there.\n\n123\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a good example of that,\nsince we're talking to middle school and\n\n124\n00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.420\nhigh school students.\n\n125\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.130\nIs your teacher might set up\na folder where they want you to put\n\n126\n00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.310\nthe homework in.\n\n127\n00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.290\nThey want all the students\nto put that homework in.\n\n128\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.392\nBut they don't want to allow the students\nto see what's in that folder,\n\n129\n00:06:13.392 --> 00:06:16.822\nbecause if they were able to\nsee what's inside that folder,\n\n130\n00:06:16.822 --> 00:06:20.474\nthey might grab another students work and\nthen perhaps copy it.\n\n131\n00:06:20.474 --> 00:06:21.697\n&gt;&gt; Never [LAUGH].\n\n132\n00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:23.920\n&gt;&gt; I'm just throwing that\nout as a mere possibility.\n\n133\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then you also see your rights\nand your reads down here as well for\n\n134\n00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.020\nthose folder options.\n\n135\n00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.940\nAnd then we have this cool concept\nof parent and child objects,\n\n136\n00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.790\nand you might here these terms.\n\n137\n00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.430\nLike we spoke about before,\nwe have objects with subordinate or\n\n138\n00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.240\nnested objects, and\nthat would be an example.\n\n139\n00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.754\nWhat do they have here?\n\n140\n00:06:43.754 --> 00:06:45.879\nWe've got folders inside\nof Folders over here.\n\n141\n00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:51.287\nSo if you think about folders, they're\nkind of like, in my mind, let's say,\n\n142\n00:06:51.287 --> 00:06:56.776\nI have kids, and we have baskets where we\nput our toys in, so when we're cleaning\n\n143\n00:06:56.776 --> 00:07:01.745\nup our room, folders are kind of like\na logical way to organize our data.\n\n144\n00:07:01.745 --> 00:07:04.875\nSo sometimes we'll go ahead and\nput them inside of another folder.\n\n145\n00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:07.855\nAnd in that sense, I don't know if you\nguys have ever heard of inheritance,\n\n146\n00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:12.515\nlike if a parent passes away, they may\nleave their belongings to their children.\n\n147\n00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:16.495\nSo that's kind of introducing\nus to this next concept here and\n\n148\n00:07:16.495 --> 00:07:19.445\nthat is going to be\ninheritable permissions.\n\n149\n00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.950\nSo, here we are, the default objects.\n\n150\n00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.320\nAnd that is, not default objects.\n\n151\n00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.150\nBy default objects that\nare inside of a parent object,\n\n152\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.540\ninherit the same permissions that\nare assigned to that parent object.\n\n153\n00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.630\nSo, if for example,\nthe parent object had read.\n\n154\n00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.644\nAnd that was the only\nright that was there.\n\n155\n00:07:42.644 --> 00:07:47.582\nThen the folder inside of there, you could\nonly read that which is inside of that\n\n156\n00:07:47.582 --> 00:07:50.100\nfolder which would be the-\n&gt;&gt; For those child optimist.\n\n157\n00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.484\n&gt;&gt; Right and\nlike the leaf objects basically.\n\n158\n00:07:52.484 --> 00:07:53.340\nUltimately.\n\n159\n00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.623\nSo that gives you a sense of\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's nice.\n\n160\n00:07:56.623 --> 00:08:01.660\nWe also have the option to\nkind of break that rule too.\n\n161\n00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.700\nSo if I wanted a child object\nto do more than just read,\n\n162\n00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.080\nknow that it is possible to do that also.\n\n163\n00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.570\nSo I think you wanted to go ahead and\n\n164\n00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.059\nshow us some of these cool concepts Steve\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n165\n00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:16.163\nlet's go over to my machine and what I've\ndone here is I created at the root of C,\n\n166\n00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:18.230\nbecause it makes life simple.\n\n167\n00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.150\nA folder called Stuff.\n\n168\n00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.200\nAnd inside that folder.\n\n169\n00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.440\n&gt;&gt; Yay for Stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, stuff.\n\n170\n00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.840\nI've created three folders.\n\n171\n00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.360\nOne that I want everybody to\nhave a right to look at and\n\n172\n00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.000\nto do with whatever I deem appropriate for\nthem to do.\n\n173\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.430\nAnd then I have a Steve's Secret Folder,\nand\n\n174\n00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.060\nthen down the road we'll be dealing\nwith the encryption folder.\n\n175\n00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.790\nBut right now we're only\ngonna deal with these two.\n\n176\n00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:47.170\n&gt;&gt; So these three folders are all child\nobjects of your stuff parent objects.\n\n177\n00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:47.920\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n178\n00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.170\n&gt;&gt; So if we go the Stuff folder,\njust to prove this inheritance,\n\n179\n00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.040\nand I haven't done anything\nto change it at all.\n\n180\n00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.270\nIf we right click and we go down to\nProperties here, you bring that up.\n\n181\n00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.900\nAnd we go into the Security Tab.\n\n182\n00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:07.290\nThis generally shows us what\nsort of rights users have.\n\n183\n00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.000\nAnd these are authenticated users,\nthe ones that's highlighted.\n\n184\n00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.570\nI know you can't read that but\nit's authenticated users.\n\n185\n00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.382\n&gt;&gt; They probably have better\nvision than we do, Steve.\n\n186\n00:09:15.382 --> 00:09:17.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're probably right.\n\n187\n00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.250\nBut I can read it and, yeah.\n\n188\n00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.130\nSo that's the problem with having to\nwear glasses when you want to try and\n\n189\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.280\nread something.\n\n190\n00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.880\nSo it's authenticated users below that is,\nand\n\n191\n00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.590\nyou can see down here authenticated\nusers have all the rights,\n\n192\n00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:34.550\nall the rights that we identified\nexcept for full control.\n\n193\n00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.730\nAnd that's because they\ndon't own the object.\n\n194\n00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.570\nI own the object.\n\n195\n00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.700\nAnd therefore I would have full control.\n\n196\n00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.090\nAs you can see, if I click down\nhere to user, wait, let me go here.\n\n197\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.890\nSo we have authenticated users,\nwe have systems, we have administrator.\n\n198\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.796\nAnd I'm of course, Steve,\nthe administrator in this thing.\n\n199\n00:09:52.796 --> 00:09:56.220\nSo, I have all rights to it.\n\n200\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.890\nWhen it was created,\nbecause I am an administrator,\n\n201\n00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.359\nthe administrator is the owner.\n\n202\n00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.964\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n203\n00:10:02.964 --> 00:10:03.710\n&gt;&gt; So.\n\n204\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.340\n&gt;&gt; Let's check out the child.\n\n205\n00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's check out the child.\n\n206\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.585\n&gt;&gt; The children, I should say.\n\n207\n00:10:08.585 --> 00:10:09.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n208\n00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.050\nyou probably are not gonna be\nsurprised at this because we didn't\n\n209\n00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.860\ndo anything different.\n\n210\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.830\nSo this is the stuff everyone folder.\n\n211\n00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.990\nIf I go back to here at Everyone and\nright click and\n\n212\n00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.740\ndo the same thing and\ngo down here to Properties and\n\n213\n00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.750\nwe go to Security,\nit is identically the same as you can see.\n\n214\n00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.500\nSystem has full control mainly everything.\n\n215\n00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.605\n&gt;&gt; So that's inheritance right there?\n\n216\n00:10:30.605 --> 00:10:33.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's direct inheritance.\n\n217\n00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.750\nAnd then we have Steve's\nsecret folder down here.\n\n218\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.110\nAnd let me go, and\nyou'll see that there's a permission.\n\n219\n00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:45.695\nWe'll start at and\nplay around a bit with that one first.\n\n220\n00:10:45.695 --> 00:10:46.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n221\n00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:52.110\n&gt;&gt; So if we go to its Properties,\nand we look at the security\n\n222\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:57.320\nrelative to it, you can see that we\nhave those very same permissions.\n\n223\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:10:59.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now before I got there,\n\n224\n00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.120\nlet me put a file in here.\n\n225\n00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.980\nAnd it's real simple.\n\n226\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.390\nIf you want to see how to do this,\nyou put in new.\n\n227\n00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.040\nAnd I'll just put in a text document,\nand I won't even rename it.\n\n228\n00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.470\nIt's a new text document,\nit is a .TXT document.\n\n229\n00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n230\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.920\n&gt;&gt; So if we looked at its permissions, and\n\n231\n00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:22.310\ngo to Properties, as you might not expect.\n\n232\n00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.680\nWe're kind of exactly the same.\n\n233\n00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, accept, authenticated,\n\n234\n00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.680\nwell here we go through the,\nand it is the same--\n\n235\n00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.630\n&gt;&gt; Now, Steve, this is your secret folder.\n\n236\n00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.400\nAnd this text document is\ninside your secret folder.\n\n237\n00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.020\nSo, if you wanted to really lock\ndown the contents of this folder,\n\n238\n00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.660\nwhat are some things we could do here?\n\n239\n00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first thing we're gonna\nhave to do is break inheritance.\n\n240\n00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:51.136\nSo we're go back up here to Staff, and\nwe're gonna go to Steve's secret folder.\n\n241\n00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:53.942\nAnd we're gonna go to Properties.\n\n242\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.420\nAnd we got to break inheritance.\n\n243\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.890\nSo the way we are gonna do\nthis is we gonna go Advanced.\n\n244\n00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:09.730\nAnd in order to break inheritance,\nyou see this little check box here?\n\n245\n00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.400\n&gt;&gt; Fairly but yes [LAUGH].\n\n246\n00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.560\n&gt;&gt; Include inheritance permission\nfrom the objects parent.\n\n247\n00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.850\nWe're not gonna be able to do that.\n\n248\n00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.760\nWe're gonna actually have to break it and\nnotice here if I click on it,\n\n249\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.760\nthere's a little check there.\n\n250\n00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.600\nI can't change that check and so\n\n251\n00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.710\nI'm sitting here scratching my\nhead saying, how do I do that?\n\n252\n00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:34.440\nAnd so, what I have to do here\nis I click Change Permissions.\n\n253\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.410\nAnd then we go through here and\n\n254\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.960\ninclude inheritance permissions from\nthe object's parents, and replace\n\n255\n00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.860\nall child object permissions with\ninheritance permissions from this object.\n\n256\n00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.220\nSo what do you think I got\nto do here to succeed?\n\n257\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.067\n&gt;&gt; We have to go ahead and\nchange those settings.\n\n258\n00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:59.120\nWe want to break those inherited.\n\n259\n00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.785\n&gt;&gt; Right, so if we do this, now this\nis where it gets a bit challenging.\n\n260\n00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:10.010\nBecause you could say, okay, remove all\nthose permissions and I gotta clean slate.\n\n261\n00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.820\nOften times,\nyou really don't want to do that.\n\n262\n00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n263\n00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:15.760\n&gt;&gt; Does that makes sense?\n\n264\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n265\n00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.990\n&gt;&gt; So what we can do warning if you\n\n266\n00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:26.190\nproceed the inheritable permissions would\nno longer propagate to this object.\n\n267\n00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.220\nClick add to convert and\n\n268\n00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.830\nadd inheritant permissions to\nthe objects permission of the object.\n\n269\n00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:36.440\nOr click remove to remove the inherited\npermissions from the object.\n\n270\n00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.610\nIf you click Cancel,\nyou're not gonna modify.\n\n271\n00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.660\n&gt;&gt; Nothing will happen.\n\n272\n00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.900\n&gt;&gt; Nothing will happen basically.\n\n273\n00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.354\nSo what do you wanna pick?\n\n274\n00:13:44.354 --> 00:13:45.332\n&gt;&gt; Add.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n275\n00:13:45.332 --> 00:13:50.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the reason we click Add,\n\n276\n00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.840\nis because we can go in and start.\n\n277\n00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.790\n&gt;&gt; Tweaking.\n&gt;&gt; Tweaking a bit.\n\n278\n00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.820\nAnd really what we want is we don't want,\ndo we want,\n\n279\n00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.500\nit would be nice to add\nSteve here wouldn't it?\n\n280\n00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.501\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As a safety factor.\n\n281\n00:14:04.501 --> 00:14:06.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\njust in case we mess something up.\n\n282\n00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:06.810\n&gt;&gt; Just in case.\n\n283\n00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.572\nPart of it is I'm an administrator but\nI might not always be an administator.\n\n284\n00:14:10.572 --> 00:14:11.963\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n285\n00:14:11.963 --> 00:14:15.125\n&gt;&gt; So we click Add and\nwe go in here and we type in and\n\n286\n00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:17.440\nremember I misspelled my name.\n\n287\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.342\nSo it's S-E-V-E\n&gt;&gt; Yup\n\n288\n00:14:20.342 --> 00:14:23.374\n&gt;&gt; And we check names here.\n\n289\n00:14:23.374 --> 00:14:24.423\n&gt;&gt; There you are.\n&gt;&gt; And there I am.\n\n290\n00:14:24.423 --> 00:14:26.370\nAnd I click OK.\n\n291\n00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.910\nAnd so I'm gonna go through here.\n\n292\n00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.880\nAnd I'm Steve and\nI want to be God in this folder.\n\n293\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.590\n&gt;&gt; Full control.\n\n294\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.100\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n295\n00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.510\nSo I click that and\nthat highlights everything.\n\n296\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.230\nEvery sort of permission\nyou could ever want, I get.\n\n297\n00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.400\nAnd now I get to make\ndecisions as to others.\n\n298\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.670\nAnd what I'm gonna do is,\n\n299\n00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.850\nI'm gonna just show you this because\nit's important that you understand it.\n\n300\n00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.500\nUsers, okay?\n\n301\n00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.310\nI'm a user, right?\n\n302\n00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:57.130\nAnd so if I double-click on this one,\nI don't wanna go over here and\n\n303\n00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.850\nhit any of these denies.\n\n304\n00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.490\nBecause that's an explicit deny,\n\n305\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:05.580\nand it's kind of like, I never played it,\nbut in bridge, in a card game.\n\n306\n00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.570\nThere's a trump-\n&gt;&gt; That's the same, I've never played\n\n307\n00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.490\nbridge, but I was gonna use the word\ntrumps because the deny trumps all there.\n\n308\n00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.440\nYou wanna be very careful\nabout handing out those deny\n\n309\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.640\npermissions when you're hitting\nthat little check box there.\n\n310\n00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because it trumps,\nI keep using that word and\n\n311\n00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.250\nthinking about the president.\n\n312\n00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.740\nOr the president-elect, excuse me,\nit depends upon when you're watching this.\n\n313\n00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.870\nBut it trumps.\n\n314\n00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.840\nIt overrides.\n\n315\n00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:36.609\nEven though I've given Steve full control,\nif I'm not careful here and\n\n316\n00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:42.863\ngive an explicit deny, I may wipe out\nthe permissions that I just gave myself.\n\n317\n00:15:42.863 --> 00:15:48.985\nThe best way to handle this is\nreally not deal with the permissions\n\n318\n00:15:48.985 --> 00:15:54.234\nother than simply highlight the user and\nclick Remove.\n\n319\n00:15:54.234 --> 00:15:55.157\nAll right.\n\n320\n00:15:55.157 --> 00:15:56.457\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm a member\nof the users group.\n\n321\n00:15:56.457 --> 00:16:02.490\nAnd with that current permission, I have\ncertain rights with regard to this folder.\n\n322\n00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:08.230\nBut if I remove the users group from\nthis folder, other users that are not\n\n323\n00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:13.520\nexplicitly granted permission to get\nhere lose their capability of doing so.\n\n324\n00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.310\nSo I just highlight that and\nI go Remove and they're gone.\n\n325\n00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.850\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So in essence, that's what I've done.\n\n326\n00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.660\nAnd then you go through and\nyou identify other things.\n\n327\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:29.120\nDo we want authenticated users\nto be able to modify this file?\n\n328\n00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.810\nProbably not, this is my secret folder.\n\n329\n00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.130\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We want Steve to,\n\n330\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.210\nwe don't want anybody else to.\n\n331\n00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.930\nAnd so we go and we remove.\n\n332\n00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.270\nSystem, I'm gonna leave there,\nbut what about administrators?\n\n333\n00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.010\nI'm also an administrator.\n\n334\n00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.610\n&gt;&gt; I guess it would just depend on who you\nwere adding to that administrative group.\n\n335\n00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.923\nIf you trusted them-\n&gt;&gt; But do I trust them?\n\n336\n00:16:51.923 --> 00:16:53.127\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n337\n00:16:53.127 --> 00:16:57.270\nthe problem is that I can remove them.\n\n338\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.180\nAnd then they can go through\na process where they end up\n\n339\n00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.870\ngetting back in because they're god.\n\n340\n00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.790\nGod has a way to get there.\n\n341\n00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.460\n&gt;&gt; So what could we do then\nwith that particular file,\n\n342\n00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.700\nthe files within your folder?\n\n343\n00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.123\n&gt;&gt; And that's a good question.\n\n344\n00:17:11.123 --> 00:17:12.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me show you what we can do.\n\n345\n00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.330\nSo I'm gonna leave it at this.\n\n346\n00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n347\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:19.177\nI'm gonna leave it at this and\nI'm gonna go OK and we're gonna go OK.\n\n348\n00:17:19.177 --> 00:17:25.815\nAnd so inside here, with regard to\nthis secret document that I have here.\n\n349\n00:17:25.815 --> 00:17:29.800\nAnd we're gonna talk more about\nthis with specific applications.\n\n350\n00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.020\nBut what I could do is encrypt it.\n\n351\n00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:32.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n352\n00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.070\nthis isn't true with\nevery version of Windows.\n\n353\n00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.440\nTypically, the home style editions\ndon't have this capability.\n\n354\n00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.740\nBut if I click on this folder, and\nthis I go down to its properties.\n\n355\n00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:49.450\nAnd we go through, let me see,\nif I click on advanced here.\n\n356\n00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:56.747\nNotice that I get a choice of compress or\nencrypt, okay?\n\n357\n00:17:56.747 --> 00:17:59.321\nI can't do them both, it's kind of funny.\n\n358\n00:17:59.321 --> 00:18:03.558\nThis is one of those instances where\nyou almost expect a radio button.\n\n359\n00:18:03.558 --> 00:18:08.370\nBut I cant do them both because encrypt\nfiles eliminate a lot of the ability to\n\n360\n00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.843\ncompress them because it's\na bunch of gobbledygook.\n\n361\n00:18:11.843 --> 00:18:15.410\nIt makes no sense, it's designed so\nthat you can read it.\n\n362\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.900\nSo, I'm gonna Encrypt and click Okay.\n\n363\n00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.636\n&gt;&gt; But there is a way to compress and\nencrypt,\n\n364\n00:18:20.636 --> 00:18:24.136\nwhich I have the feeling\nyou're gonna show us as well.\n\n365\n00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:25.293\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n366\n00:18:25.293 --> 00:18:26.312\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n367\n00:18:26.312 --> 00:18:27.405\n&gt;&gt; With a 7-Zip?\n\n368\n00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:29.306\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, with a 7-Zip, I could do that.\n\n369\n00:18:29.306 --> 00:18:32.070\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; But the challenge is that if I do that\n\n370\n00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:37.070\none folder, once it's encrypted, none of\nthe compression things work very well.\n\n371\n00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not here, I don't want you\nto do it, but with the other tool.\n\n372\n00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:40.531\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, also,\n\n373\n00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:42.860\nwhat was I gonna say, compression.\n\n374\n00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:48.580\nYou also dont wanna be compressing any\nof your system files either, okay.\n\n375\n00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.350\nIt's never good idea to go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n376\n00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.117\nEven if you are running low on space,\n\n377\n00:18:53.117 --> 00:18:57.112\nyou might look at other ways to increase\nstorage or eliminate other types of files.\n\n378\n00:18:57.112 --> 00:19:01.790\n&gt;&gt; Now, what I wanted to illustrate\nhere is that the color actually changes.\n\n379\n00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:02.440\n&gt;&gt; To green.\n\n380\n00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to green.\n\n381\n00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.830\nAnd I doubt that,\nI guess you can see green out there.\n\n382\n00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:10.720\nSo when you create a file or\nyou create a folder and\n\n383\n00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.750\nyou designate the encryption, the file,\nit will encrypt the individual file.\n\n384\n00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.910\nYou can go up and\nreach up to the folder and\n\n385\n00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.740\ninsist that anything that's\ndropped into that is encrypted.\n\n386\n00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.273\n&gt;&gt; So\nnow your secret folder is super secret?\n\n387\n00:19:23.273 --> 00:19:28.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes it is, limited permissions,\njust me, pretty much.\n\n388\n00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.660\nAnd then even if administrators could\nstill get in there because I left them\n\n389\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.550\nbehind, they still could\nnot read that file.\n\n390\n00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.440\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n391\n00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.590\n&gt;&gt; But I say that jokingly because\nwhat they could do is they\n\n392\n00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.250\ncould go into my account and\nchange the password.\n\n393\n00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.382\nAnd then log on effectively as me and\nlook at this.\n\n394\n00:19:44.382 --> 00:19:45.633\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There are always loopholes,\naren't they?\n\n395\n00:19:45.633 --> 00:19:49.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there are always ways, so\nwe still have to trust the administrators.\n\n396\n00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.330\nAnd one of the ways that we\ncan continue to trust them and\n\n397\n00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.465\nnot worry about them is that\nwe log all their activities.\n\n398\n00:19:55.465 --> 00:19:57.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So at least we can, down the road,\n\n399\n00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.400\nsee that they're doing bad\nadministrative things through logging.\n\n400\n00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, so do you wanna take\na look at the 7-Zip or save that?\n\n401\n00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.934\n&gt;&gt; We can go ahead and take a look at it.\n\n402\n00:20:07.934 --> 00:20:12.280\n7-Zip, I have on my machine here,\nmy base machine.\n\n403\n00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.290\nAnd what I'm gonna do,\nand I also have Word.\n\n404\n00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.770\nSo we can go through and\nlook at how you would encrypt a Word file.\n\n405\n00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:21.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n406\n00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.270\nwhat I need to do is to go into here,\nfor example.\n\n407\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.605\nAnd I've highlighted two files.\n\n408\n00:20:28.605 --> 00:20:34.250\nAnd if I right-click on them, I can go\nto 7-Zip and I can go Add to archive.\n\n409\n00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:41.810\nAnd we'll call this new zip, I don't know.\n\n410\n00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.230\nIt doesn't really matter what we call it.\n\n411\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.950\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n412\n00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:48.070\n&gt;&gt; And then we can put in a password and\nwe go here and we can type in password.\n\n413\n00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.823\nWhat's a good password?\n\n414\n00:20:48.823 --> 00:20:50.600\nP-A-S-S-W-O-R-D.\n\n415\n00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we re-enter it P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D.\n\n416\n00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.300\nAnd then we click OK.\n\n417\n00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:00.022\n&gt;&gt; And if you see you could also note\nthat you can choose a different forms,\n\n418\n00:21:00.022 --> 00:21:02.146\nyour encryption algorithms there too.\n\n419\n00:21:02.146 --> 00:21:02.681\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could do that.\n\n420\n00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:04.273\n&gt;&gt; AES 256, that's pretty cool.\n\n421\n00:21:04.273 --> 00:21:06.199\n&gt;&gt; That's a pretty good, so\n\n422\n00:21:06.199 --> 00:21:10.235\nlet me see if I can find this\nthing that I just zipped up.\n\n423\n00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:11.380\nLet me see, I'll put it in order.\n\n424\n00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:11.889\n&gt;&gt; Newzip?\n\n425\n00:21:11.889 --> 00:21:13.246\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, do you see new zip?\n\n426\n00:21:13.246 --> 00:21:14.683\n&gt;&gt; Date modified?\n\n427\n00:21:14.683 --> 00:21:16.435\nYou're [LAUGH].\n\n428\n00:21:16.435 --> 00:21:17.380\n&gt;&gt; Here it is, I found it.\n\n429\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.360\n&gt;&gt; Right on top.\n\n430\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.010\n&gt;&gt; I found it.\n\n431\n00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.200\nAnd so I would go like this and\nI double click on it.\n\n432\n00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.724\nCome on, I think I double clicked.\n\n433\n00:21:26.467 --> 00:21:28.722\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I get extra\nclick happy there.\n\n434\n00:21:28.722 --> 00:21:29.894\nIs it behind the window?\n\n435\n00:21:29.894 --> 00:21:30.730\nDid it pop up for us?\n\n436\n00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.920\n&gt;&gt; It might have,\nlet's see if it's back there.\n\n437\n00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.420\nNo?\n\n438\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:39.650\nWell, let me right-click, sometimes that's\nthe best way to do it, and say Open.\n\n439\n00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.970\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n440\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.424\nWhere did it go?\n\n441\n00:21:43.424 --> 00:21:45.369\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where did it go?\n\n442\n00:21:48.178 --> 00:21:50.320\nI don't know.\n\n443\n00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.724\nThe reality here with 7-Zip is I seldom\nuse it because Windows comes with its own\n\n444\n00:21:54.724 --> 00:21:55.513\nZIP program.\n\n445\n00:21:55.513 --> 00:21:57.833\n&gt;&gt; I've never used that program.\n\n446\n00:21:57.833 --> 00:22:03.338\n&gt;&gt; The reason why we're showing you this\nis because Cyber Patriot uses 7-Zip.\n\n447\n00:22:03.338 --> 00:22:08.312\nAnd so when your coach gets that image and\nit's emailed to your coach,\n\n448\n00:22:08.312 --> 00:22:11.615\nhe will have to go in and\nopen it using 7-Zip.\n\n449\n00:22:11.615 --> 00:22:12.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n450\n00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:15.660\n&gt;&gt; And actually, that's the way you do it.\n\n451\n00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.655\nYou bring up 7-Zip and then I-\n&gt;&gt; File &gt; Open.\n\n452\n00:22:17.655 --> 00:22:20.134\n&gt;&gt; Go to that file and\nI try to open it and\n\n453\n00:22:20.134 --> 00:22:23.788\nit springs the result that\nI need to have a password.\n\n454\n00:22:23.788 --> 00:22:25.114\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm not really gonna\n\n455\n00:22:25.114 --> 00:22:28.255\ngo through that because typically,\nyou as students would not go through that.\n\n456\n00:22:28.255 --> 00:22:30.542\nThat's a function of the coach.\n\n457\n00:22:30.542 --> 00:22:32.566\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But let me show you Word real quick.\n\n458\n00:22:32.566 --> 00:22:36.084\nBecause this is,\nwe talk about passwords and\n\n459\n00:22:36.084 --> 00:22:39.332\nwe talk about keeping them safe, right?\n\n460\n00:22:39.332 --> 00:22:43.220\nAnd your mother, and everybody's mother,\n\n461\n00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:48.010\ndoesn't understand encryption and\nis not a geek.\n\n462\n00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:51.360\nAnd so\nwhat do they do with their passwords?\n\n463\n00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.450\nWell, they write them in a book,\non a sheet of paper, and\n\n464\n00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.720\nthey keep that piece of paper safe.\n\n465\n00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.680\nAnd that's probably not\nthe best thing that you can do.\n\n466\n00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:06.035\n&gt;&gt; Especially in a digital file like this,\nif the file is compromised.\n\n467\n00:23:06.035 --> 00:23:10.970\n&gt;&gt; So this is a password list and\npassword, oops, let me scroll down here.\n\n468\n00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:16.284\nSo my favorite password is fluffy,\nF-L-U-F-F-Y, cuz that's my dog.\n\n469\n00:23:16.284 --> 00:23:23.265\nAnd I'm gonna put Gmail, so\nI'm tying it to the account.\n\n470\n00:23:23.265 --> 00:23:23.817\n&gt;&gt; So you can remember.\n\n471\n00:23:23.817 --> 00:23:25.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I can remember-\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n472\n00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:26.851\n&gt;&gt; And I have a whole list here.\n\n473\n00:23:26.851 --> 00:23:33.651\nAnd what I need to do is File, and\nyou see Protect Document here?\n\n474\n00:23:33.651 --> 00:23:34.439\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n475\n00:23:34.439 --> 00:23:36.399\n&gt;&gt; So I hit Protect Document and\n\n476\n00:23:36.399 --> 00:23:40.690\none of my choices down here\nis Encrypt with Password.\n\n477\n00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:47.013\nAnd I click that and I type in the famous\npassword, P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D, and I click OK.\n\n478\n00:23:47.013 --> 00:23:53.540\nAnd I re-enter it, P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D and\nI go like this, OK.\n\n479\n00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.520\nAnd now I go and I save my word.\n\n480\n00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.710\nBut let me just back up,\nmake sure it's still there.\n\n481\n00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.472\nSee, nothing's changed, it's there.\n\n482\n00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:05.718\nSo I do File &gt; Save As,\nand I'm gonna put it in,\n\n483\n00:24:05.718 --> 00:24:13.870\ngonna go here to my computer cuz we\ngotta put it somewhere here, go there.\n\n484\n00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.686\nAnd we think and\nit hopefully gets us somewhere.\n\n485\n00:24:16.686 --> 00:24:19.976\nAnd we go up here and\nwe'll put it in downloads,\n\n486\n00:24:19.976 --> 00:24:23.037\ncuz that's kinda where I dump everything.\n\n487\n00:24:23.037 --> 00:24:26.456\nAnd we're gonna call this,\nleave it at that, right, password list?\n\n488\n00:24:26.456 --> 00:24:27.429\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n489\n00:24:27.429 --> 00:24:31.893\n&gt;&gt; And then we close it, cuz it's,\n\n490\n00:24:31.893 --> 00:24:35.564\ncome on, let me close you.\n\n491\n00:24:35.564 --> 00:24:36.426\nThere we go.\n\n492\n00:24:38.052 --> 00:24:39.341\nLet me close you.\n\n493\n00:24:42.243 --> 00:24:48.444\n&gt;&gt; There it goes, I think it's-\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Windows is not responding.\n\n494\n00:24:48.444 --> 00:24:53.863\nSo I'll, oops, Wants to do it again,\nwe'll do it again, right?\n\n495\n00:24:56.257 --> 00:24:57.421\nAnd then we close it.\n\n496\n00:24:57.421 --> 00:25:00.640\nAnd so now we go back down\nto our Downloads folder.\n\n497\n00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.350\nAnd it should be somewhere\nright up here on top, right?\n\n498\n00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.623\nSo we go here, and there it is.\n\n499\n00:25:06.623 --> 00:25:07.994\n&gt;&gt; Password list, there you go.\n\n500\n00:25:07.994 --> 00:25:09.963\n&gt;&gt; So we go like this and guess what?\n\n501\n00:25:09.963 --> 00:25:12.384\nI gotta type in password, it's encrypted.\n\n502\n00:25:14.976 --> 00:25:15.533\nAnd that's it.\n\n503\n00:25:15.533 --> 00:25:17.045\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool, right?\n\n504\n00:25:17.045 --> 00:25:21.908\nSo this may really help,\nI don't encourage using this, students.\n\n505\n00:25:21.908 --> 00:25:24.428\nYou're sophisticated enough\nto use a program out there,\n\n506\n00:25:24.428 --> 00:25:25.617\nan application out there.\n\n507\n00:25:25.617 --> 00:25:29.270\nProbably LastPass if I\nwere recommending one.\n\n508\n00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:33.240\nIt's a great password vault,\nit's accessible over the Internet.\n\n509\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.101\nAnd so\nif you're jumping from machine to machine,\n\n510\n00:25:36.101 --> 00:25:40.238\nyou can go to the LastPass site and\nyou can get a list of all your passwords.\n\n511\n00:25:40.238 --> 00:25:42.724\n&gt;&gt; It's like a master password list,\nyeah, a password list so\n\n512\n00:25:42.724 --> 00:25:44.870\nyou don't have to create\nthat Word document.\n\n513\n00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.067\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the only thing you have\nto remember is your master password.\n\n514\n00:25:48.067 --> 00:25:49.806\n&gt;&gt; Master password, yep.\n\n515\n00:25:49.806 --> 00:25:51.062\n&gt;&gt; Yep, okay.\n\n516\n00:25:51.062 --> 00:25:52.375\n&gt;&gt; I think does about sum it up.\n\n517\n00:25:52.375 --> 00:25:56.595\nYou showed us some really great tips on\nhow we can really lock down some data\n\n518\n00:25:56.595 --> 00:25:59.400\nwithin our environment,\nso I appreciate that.\n\n519\n00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.012\nI know you guys out there do, and\nI appreciate you for following along.\n\n520\n00:26:03.012 --> 00:26:06.081\nBut we do have more information\nheaded your way, so stay tuned.\n\n521\n00:26:06.081 --> 00:26:08.589\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up for this episode and\n\n522\n00:26:08.589 --> 00:26:11.260\nI'm gonna sign off as your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n523\n00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.890\n&gt;&gt; And im Professor Steve Linthicum\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here for\n\n524\n00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:16.175\ncyber security\n\n525\n00:26:16.175 --> 00:26:22.053\n[MUSIC]\n\n526\n00:26:22.053 --> 00:26:25.283\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

Welcome CyberPatriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:17.640\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.495\nIn this particular episode we're going\nto be looking at auditing measures.\n\n7\n00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:23.267\nWindows auditing techniques.\n\n8\n00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:26.721\nSo when we say auditing, we mean logging,\nand we're going to go ahead and\n\n9\n00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:28.290\nstart with Event Viewer.\n\n10\n00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.520\nWith us today to go ahead and\nshow us how to access Event Viewer and\n\n11\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.560\nkind of decipher what all of those events\nmean we have Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n12\n00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.370\nThank you for joining us today Steve.\n\n13\n00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.400\n&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.\n\n14\n00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.049\nYeah, we're going to be looking\nat logging and what can I say,\n\n15\n00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:48.880\nI wouldn't call this thrilling but\nit's kind of a necessary.\n\n16\n00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.690\nIt's important because what you're trying\nto do is figure out what happened and why.\n\n17\n00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.290\nAnd oftentimes after the fact.\n\n18\n00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.480\nAnd so you're going to get logging\nevents through logging mechanisms,\n\n19\n00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.640\nlogging programs,\nthat exist inside Windows.\n\n20\n00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.060\nAnd then you're going to get\nthis information, digest it, and\n\n21\n00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.100\nfigure out what it means.\n\n22\n00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.360\nThe good news is that there's\nsoftware out there that helps you.\n\n23\n00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.520\nAnd this isn't the software, incidentally.\n\n24\n00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.720\nThese are individual log entries.\n\n25\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.900\nAnd as we go through, and\nwe'll look at a couple of them.\n\n26\n00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.050\nJust to show you what kind\nof information you get.\n\n27\n00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.990\nAnd you're probably gonna\nbe scratching your head and\n\n28\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.190\nthis is where Google comes in.\n\n29\n00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Because you're gonna have\n\n30\n00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.670\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like\n\n31\n00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.270\nan investigation, right?\n\n32\n00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but sometimes the log\nentries are a bit cryptic.\n\n33\n00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.000\nAnd so\nyou gotta figure out what they mean.\n\n34\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.745\n&gt;&gt; Thank goodness for the internet.\n\n35\n00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:37.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n\n36\n00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.650\n&gt;&gt; So let's go through and\n\n37\n00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.450\nstart of with the slide.\n\n38\n00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.980\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And then we'll move over to my machine.\n\n39\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.490\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n40\n00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.130\nlet's take a look here at Event Viewer.\n\n41\n00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.390\nSo just noting that Event Viewer is\nsecurity tool that allows you to view\n\n42\n00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.300\nthese records of changes and other events\nthat happen on your computer systems here.\n\n43\n00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.260\nIt's used for\ncyber security professionals,\n\n44\n00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.390\nyou'll hear this term, a Security analyst.\n\n45\n00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.400\nSo that's essentially what we're doing\nhere, is analyzing these events so\n\n46\n00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.650\nthat we have a good idea as to\nwhat's happening in our environment.\n\n47\n00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.900\nAnd then again it just shows you where you\ncan go ahead and access your Event Viewer.\n\n48\n00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.960\nUnder Control Panel, System and Security,\nAdministrative Tools, and there you go.\n\n49\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.360\nThat's where you would find Event Viewer.\n\n50\n00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.340\nOkay, so let's go on to my machine so\nwe could show couple of shots here.\n\n51\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.850\nAnd basically what we're\ndoing is we can get\n\n52\n00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.060\nto Event Viewer by bringing up the\ncomputer management to what we've access\n\n53\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.560\nthrough administrative\ntools a number of times.\n\n54\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.360\nAnd on my screen here, you can look on my\nleft hand side and it has Windows logs.\n\n55\n00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.430\nIt has application logs,\nthe security log, the set up log,\n\n56\n00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.330\nthe system log, and forwarded events.\n\n57\n00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.400\nAnd the reason I'm bringing\nup the system log is\n\n58\n00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.350\nthis is a brand new installation that I\ndid shortly before we started this module.\n\n59\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.900\nSo there isn't a lot of stuff here\n\n60\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.490\nthat's what I would\ncharacterize as not bad stuff.\n\n61\n00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.960\nBecause this particular log and\na couple of the other logs,\n\n62\n00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.980\nthe application logs tend to get\nfilled up with a bunch of junk.\n\n63\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.190\nWhich looks really bad.\n\n64\n00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.040\nThis, for example, the top one that\nI've glued here is titled a warning.\n\n65\n00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.330\nAnd what happens, and\nthis is where it happens,\n\n66\n00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.150\nis somebody,\ntypically with a foreign accent, perhaps.\n\n67\n00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.960\nMaybe from eastern Europe or\nwell they're not really here, but\n\n68\n00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.930\nwhat they want to do is\nthey want to call you.\n\n69\n00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.950\n&gt;&gt; They want you to give them access\ninto your system, first of all.\n\n70\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I've had this to me before,\n\n71\n00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.100\nand well you just don't\neven let it get that far.\n\n72\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.000\nBecause Microsoft is not gonna\nbe calling you, number one.\n\n73\n00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.220\nNo, no, they're not gonna call and\n\n74\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.140\ntell you that there's something\nreally wrong with your machine.\n\n75\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.880\nAnd when they do that, in order to make\nthem sound like they know what you're\n\n76\n00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.810\ntalking about, they will have you actually\ngo into the logs, one or more of the logs.\n\n77\n00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.800\nAnd I'll ask you if you see\nany of those reds things and\n\n78\n00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.870\nyellow things and you know.\n\n79\n00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.950\nSerious.\n&gt;&gt; Trying to make it seem like it's a big\n\n80\n00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.730\ndeal when it's really not.\n\n81\n00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.640\nWe have these events there.\n\n82\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.960\nOf course, yes, it can be a big deal,\n\n83\n00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.360\nbut it's really a scare tactic from\na scammer that you see this happens.\n\n84\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.280\n&gt;&gt; So they say\n\n85\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.610\nI want to take control of your machine\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n86\n00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.880\nthere are ways that you can do this.\n\n87\n00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.860\nI know in a previous slide we\ntalked about remote access.\n\n88\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.440\nAnd there are remote access\ntools where that bad guy\n\n89\n00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.820\nfrom overseas gets on your machine,\nand guess what they do.\n\n90\n00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.590\nThey infect your machine so\nthat they can make things worse for you.\n\n91\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.310\n&gt;&gt; And then they ask you for\nyour credit card number to fix it.\n\n92\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, they ask you for\nyour credit card number to fix it.\n\n93\n00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.730\nYou should have hung up a long time ago.\n\n94\n00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.890\nBut you didn't, because of course they\ncome to this, this is on your machine.\n\n95\n00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.260\nAnd yeah, there are warnings there, and\n\n96\n00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.010\nthere are serious alerts there,\njust because there are.\n\n97\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.880\nAnd it doesn't mean that your\nmachine is really misbehaving.\n\n98\n00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.960\n&gt;&gt; Steve, can you maximize that so\nI can see one other column there?\n\n99\n00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.255\n&gt;&gt; Let me see if I can, here.\n\n100\n00:04:56.255 --> 00:04:58.060\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay there we go.\n\n101\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.030\nI think your event ID that's also\na helpful column there that second to\n\n102\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.640\nlast one.\n\n103\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.830\nAnd then there's a horizontal box in\ngrey that gives you a brief description\n\n104\n00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.060\nunderneath from the one\nthat's highlighted.\n\n105\n00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.790\nBut that's what Steve was talking about,\ngoing online doing a little research.\n\n106\n00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.390\nResearch, that's where you're really\ngonna, because here's the thing if this\n\n107\n00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:23.020\nevent has happened most likely it's\nhappened to someone else as well.\n\n108\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.810\nIn the technology industry people\n\n109\n00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.685\nare really helpful when it comes to these\ntypes of problems generally speaking.\n\n110\n00:05:30.685 --> 00:05:35.125\nIn forums and knowledge bases, you can go\nahead and search for issues that may have\n\n111\n00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:38.665\nhappened to someone else and see if their\nsolution might work for your situation.\n\n112\n00:05:38.665 --> 00:05:41.375\n&gt;&gt; And so getting back to my screen here.\n\n113\n00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:44.055\nYou can see I double\nclicked on the event and\n\n114\n00:05:44.055 --> 00:05:49.300\nwe get this bit of information which\ntells us the nature of the issue.\n\n115\n00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.090\nAnd if we want, we get a little bit more\ninformation down here that event ID and\n\n116\n00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.130\nsome other stuff.\n\n117\n00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.340\nNot a lot of stuff when\nit happened basically.\n\n118\n00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.060\nAnd then we can go on to details and\nwe get some more information.\n\n119\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.370\nWe get an address and\nwe get the address link and some stuff.\n\n120\n00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:15.230\nAnd it's this hard to make has your tails\nof but again this is not really important.\n\n121\n00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and on the left-hand side\nthey do have a slide for that.\n\n122\n00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.970\nAnd I'm glad you mentioned the difference\nthere because our application.\n\n123\n00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.920\nThose are gonna be really\nevents associated for\n\n124\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.600\nparticular programs or apps there.\n\n125\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.320\n&gt;&gt; Let me bring that up.\n\n126\n00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.280\n&gt;&gt; Your security.\n\n127\n00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.200\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; And you can see we\n\n128\n00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.510\nhave a whole bunch there.\n\n129\n00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.860\nSecurity and let me bring that up.\n\n130\n00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.860\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthis one a little bit but\n\n131\n00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.800\nas you look down everything looks good,\nthat's a kind of a key sign.\n\n132\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.470\nAnd then we have a lock and it says,\naudit success, audit success.\n\n133\n00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.770\nThese are all successes.\n\n134\n00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.880\nThese are actually log ins we have and\nlog offs.\n\n135\n00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.790\nLog ins and logs off.\n\n136\n00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:50.470\nLog offs.\n\n137\n00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.990\nAnd you can see here that\nwe have an audit failure.\n\n138\n00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.260\nThat particular one,\ncredential validation.\n\n139\n00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:02.340\nAnd frankly what I did was I had created\nearlier a user account called Cherokee and\n\n140\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.300\nhad a password associated with it.\n\n141\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.950\nAnd I switched over to that user trying to\nlog on and typed in the wrong password.\n\n142\n00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.770\nSo this indicates to us that\nwe have a failure to log on\n\n143\n00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.300\n&gt;&gt; Now Steve you mentioned that looking at\n\n144\n00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.250\nthis historical data here,\nwe could kind of backtrack and\n\n145\n00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.937\nsee what possibly happened.\n\n146\n00:07:22.937 --> 00:07:28.950\nBut keeping a good eye on these logs\ncan even help prevent certain attacks.\n\n147\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.970\nAnd looking at those failed\nlogin attempts, attacks or\n\n148\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.670\nthe failed login attempts\nexcuse me if I can talk.\n\n149\n00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.610\nIt could be a precursor to some\ntype of password attack there.\n\n150\n00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.670\nKind of raise that alarm there for you.\n\n151\n00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.940\nSo it's not always used just for\n\n152\n00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:50.170\nthe pass it can be used for\npreventative monitoring as well.\n\n153\n00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd one of the things that\n\n154\n00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.540\nwe don't get here because\nwe haven't paid for\n\n155\n00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.090\nit is that there are third\nparty monitoring tools.\n\n156\n00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.770\nAnd Microsoft has monitoring\ntools that you can pay for.\n\n157\n00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.790\nRather than having to go through here and\ndigest all this information,\n\n158\n00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.870\nthis is almost where artificial\nintelligence comes in.\n\n159\n00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.350\nBecause there is-\n&gt;&gt; Analysis engines.\n\n160\n00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.050\n&gt;&gt; Tons, yes, tons of information here.\n\n161\n00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:18.070\nAnd so if there were a whole series of\nexamples where we had audit failures for\n\n162\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.030\na login process, you would be alerted to,\n\n163\n00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.710\nyou know there's a brute force--\n&gt;&gt; Intrusion detection\n\n164\n00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:24.520\nsystems--\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n165\n00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.530\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\nthere's one that's free out there.\n\n166\n00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.024\nSo I don't know if you guys,\nyeah, they would probably-\n\n167\n00:08:30.024 --> 00:08:30.609\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they're entirely free\n\n168\n00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:31.411\n&gt;&gt; Would be able to snort.\n\n169\n00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:32.870\nSnort is a free tool out there.\n\n170\n00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd incidentally,\n\n171\n00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.290\nwe're going to talk about the, well\nit's a good time to talk about it now.\n\n172\n00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.690\nYou're allowed to use and\n\n173\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.370\nI think I mentioned this earlier,\nthird party tools as long as they're free.\n\n174\n00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.690\nI come back and remind you of that.\n\n175\n00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.370\nSo, again, you're gonna probably\nwant to look at the material so\n\n176\n00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.230\nthat I provide on that other website\nit's in the end of the slides.\n\n177\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:59.260\nWhere you can go through and\nI'll have the whole set of\n\n178\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:05.140\ntools that I see other student teams\nusing that are free out there.\n\n179\n00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.040\nAnd provide you with the link that will\nenable you to build your tool chest.\n\n180\n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.450\nAnd your tool chest I don't\nthink I have one with me.\n\n181\n00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.040\nBut you know a jump drive,\nthat's your tool chest so\n\n182\n00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.380\nthat you can put it in the machine and\n\n183\n00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.438\nyou're not gonna have to download it\nthe day of the competition, okay.\n\n184\n00:09:21.438 --> 00:09:26.180\n&gt;&gt; Now Steve you just mentioned that\nyou had these failed log in attempts.\n\n185\n00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.960\nNow the first time when we went\nto go ahead and run this and\n\n186\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.270\nthere was a failed login attempt.\n\n187\n00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.685\nThere was something that\nwe didn't configure.\n\n188\n00:09:32.685 --> 00:09:33.957\nAnd what was that?\n\n189\n00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:35.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n190\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.750\nLet me see if I can bring that up.\n\n191\n00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.880\nGoing back and we've been here before.\n\n192\n00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.580\nWe were here before relating\nto account policies.\n\n193\n00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.210\nWe have local policies and\nthere's a whole list of them and\n\n194\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.180\none of them is audit policies, and\nyou can see I brought up this screen.\n\n195\n00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.910\nWe were in this area up here before in\na previous one where we did password\n\n196\n00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.570\npolicies and account lockout policies.\n\n197\n00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.290\nIn local policies,\nthe first one up is audit policies.\n\n198\n00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:06.110\nAnd this is where you would initiate\na policy relating To auditing.\n\n199\n00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.590\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou could see those failed login attempts.\n\n200\n00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.285\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nwhat I did was I checked the boxes here.\n\n201\n00:10:11.285 --> 00:10:13.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not particularly challenging.\n\n202\n00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.250\nOne thing that we had forgotten to do.\n\n203\n00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.430\nAnd you might ask yourself, well why?\n\n204\n00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:23.030\nThis is pretty important, why would the\ndefault setting not have this turned on?\n\n205\n00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.660\nParticularly for failures.\n\n206\n00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.340\nBecause they're gonna show attempts\nthat somebody's trying to hack\n\n207\n00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.280\ninto your machine.\n\n208\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.060\nAnd the reason it's not turned\non is cuz it's not turned on.\n\n209\n00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.300\nThat's the default setting for Microsoft.\n\n210\n00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and you gotta think about it,\n\n211\n00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.620\nmaybe they're going with the concept\nof it utilizing disc space.\n\n212\n00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.450\nJust know that these logs can grow.\n\n213\n00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.180\nSo if you're working in a production\nenvironment Sometimes companies will have\n\n214\n00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.500\nsome sort of log management where someone\nwill clear out the logs or maybe export\n\n215\n00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.630\nthem to some kind of archival media, so\nthat they're not bogging down your system.\n\n216\n00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, one of the typical things for\n\n217\n00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:03.290\nlogs in a high security environment is to\nget them off of this local machine and\n\n218\n00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.190\nget them to an area where people whose\n&gt;&gt; Activities are going to\n\n219\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.280\nbe logged can't have the opportunity\nto change those logs.\n\n220\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.360\nSo, they may have read permissions.\n\n221\n00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.850\nThe logs are transported over to a logging\nserver, basically, that keeps the logs.\n\n222\n00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.370\nAnd then administrators,\nfor example, can view them.\n\n223\n00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.420\n&gt;&gt; And that's a good point Steve.\n\n224\n00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:31.040\nBecause from an IT department perspective,\nyou don't ever wanna ever\n\n225\n00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.620\nseem like you're involved in\nsome sketchy or shady business.\n\n226\n00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.710\nAnd when we talked about backups,\nwe didn't go too in-depth and\n\n227\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.880\ngo through the entire process.\n\n228\n00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.950\nBut it's That same idea\nlike you wanna have\n\n229\n00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.680\na different person performing the back\nup from whomever is pulling in that\n\n230\n00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.520\nrestoration because you dont wanna make\nit seems someone is covering our tracks.\n\n231\n00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.780\nSame thing with this logs.\n\n232\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.760\nYou dont want those logs to be modified\nto kind of hide the tracks of anything.\n\n233\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.770\nSo it's definitely\nsomething to think about.\n\n234\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:02.310\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and when\n&gt;&gt; Professional hackers for\n\n235\n00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:07.310\nlack of a better word when they come in,\none of their goals is to enter into your\n\n236\n00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.830\nmachines and enter into your network and\nenter into the computers and\n\n237\n00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.170\nthen leave without any evidence\nthat they were ever there.\n\n238\n00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.400\n&gt;&gt; To cover their trucks?\n\n239\n00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.270\n&gt;&gt; Right cover their trucks and\n\n240\n00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.200\nif the log is local, one of the things\nthat they'll do is they delete the logs.\n\n241\n00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.880\nYeah so\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n242\n00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.880\nthat's another reason why we export\nthe logs to another location.\n\n243\n00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.090\nSo you can see the importance of them.\n\n244\n00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.840\nPretty obvious.\n\n245\n00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah actually let's go look at\nmy screen here on this slide cyber\n\n246\n00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.520\npatry\n&gt;&gt; Does outline some suggestions when\n\n247\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.450\nwe're looking at client and\nserver operating systems.\n\n248\n00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.910\nIt looks like the pinkish purple\ncolor here is going to be for\n\n249\n00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:50.140\nboth client, specifically they say\nWindows 7 and Server 2008 users.\n\n250\n00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.630\nAnd, then, the blue color would be\n\n251\n00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.890\nreally pertaining to those\nserver operating systems here.\n\n252\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.540\nSo these are gonna be some policy settings\nthat you might want to go ahead and\n\n253\n00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.130\ncheck on and configure it there.\n\n254\n00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.552\n&gt;&gt; And this may be a way\nto gain points obviously.\n\n255\n00:13:04.552 --> 00:13:07.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's remember that about these slides\n\n256\n00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:09.950\nis that they're making their suggestion.\n\n257\n00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:15.330\nAnd so when you go in and\nyou're looking for that last 10 points.\n\n258\n00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.920\nYou might just go down here and\nset up your logs in this fashion.\n\n259\n00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Good advice.\n\n260\n00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.150\n&gt;&gt; Enable logging for login events.\n\n261\n00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.570\nEnable that.\nAccount management, enable.\n\n262\n00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.240\nYou know, go through depending upon\nwhether, again, it's a work station or\n\n263\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.780\nit's a server.\n\n264\n00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.860\n&gt;&gt; But I would highly recommend\ngoing through that sort of strategy.\n\n265\n00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.810\nSo you may well want to build\na checklist and this is your whether or\n\n266\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.520\nnot we're logging it or not checkbook.\n\n267\n00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.080\nOr checklist, not book.\n\n268\n00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.200\nYes, okay.\n\n269\n00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.625\nI think that about wraps it up for\nthis particular episode.\n\n270\n00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:52.860\nAs you guys just saw a sneak peak there?\n\n271\n00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.430\nWe have performance\nmonitoring coming up next.\n\n272\n00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:56.390\nSo stay tuned.\n\n273\n00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.910\nDon't go anywhere and get comfortable.\n\n274\n00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:58.840\nGrab your popcorn.\n\n275\n00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.460\nWe'll gonna be taking a look\nat performance monitoring.\n\n276\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.970\nBut for this episode,\nI think that about does it.\n\n277\n00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.600\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n278\n00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.440\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n279\n00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.562\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here for\nCyberPatriot.\n\n280\n00:14:12.562 --> 00:14:18.681\n[MUSIC]\n\n281\n00:14:18.681 --> 00:14:21.781\n&gt;&gt;

Hi.\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna go to\n\n12\n00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:32.295\nmy machine and\n\n13\n00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:36.840\nfirst, we're gonna take a look at\nsomething called performance monitor.\n\n14\n00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.230\nIt's perf mon,\nI guess I'm showing my experience.\n\n15\n00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.950\nSo let's go to my screen real quick before\nwe move over to the PowerPoint slides.\n\n16\n00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.618\nAnd you can see here I'm\nin Computer Management and\n\n17\n00:00:48.618 --> 00:00:51.607\ndown here is where I would\nbring in Performance Monitor.\n\n18\n00:00:51.607 --> 00:00:53.990\nI actually have it up on the screen.\n\n19\n00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.700\nAnd this is it.\n\n20\n00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.380\nAnd what this does is it provides us\nwith a historical analysis of how our\n\n21\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.790\nmachine has behaved over a period of time.\n\n22\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.900\nSo while it's showing us here\ncurrently on the screen.\n\n23\n00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.105\nAnd it's only got a single\ncounter up there.\n\n24\n00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:11.618\nAnd I have to show you this because\nI think in their spare time,\n\n25\n00:01:11.618 --> 00:01:14.065\nif I wanted to add a counter,\nI click here.\n\n26\n00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:16.110\nAnd you can see that\nevery one one of these.\n\n27\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.300\nWe've got Processor.\n\n28\n00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.190\nWe've got all kinds of\nthings going around here.\n\n29\n00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.000\nAnd these are all of the.\n\n30\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.490\n&gt;&gt; A lot of different counters available.\n\n31\n00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.480\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthey're counters inside of counters.\n\n32\n00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you expand those out there.\n\n33\n00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.150\n&gt;&gt; So if we expand them out.\n\n34\n00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.060\nThos one's got whatever.\n\n35\n00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.520\nThis is net, log on, and\nit's got half a dozen things, and\n\n36\n00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.940\nwe go down here, and so we could, if we\nwanted to we could add this as a counter.\n\n37\n00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.020\nWhatever this is, and\nthis thing I can't even,\n\n38\n00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.540\nit's symphone something or other,\nit doesn't really matter what it is.\n\n39\n00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.680\nSo I can add that as a counter and\nI can click OK and\n\n40\n00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.130\nwe're gonna have a second counter up here\nsomewhere, it ought to start showing.\n\n41\n00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.840\nBut what happens is you could add\ncounters for really weird things,\n\n42\n00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.860\nI guess if I could say that.\n\n43\n00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.700\n&gt;&gt; So you can go ahead and\nset also like your upper or\n\n44\n00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.819\nlower control limits like thresholds so\nthat you would get alerted if\n\n45\n00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.455\nanything were to fall below a certain,\nyour sampling here.\n\n46\n00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:14.716\nAnd this is not an EKG screen or\n\n47\n00:02:14.716 --> 00:02:18.125\n[LAUGH] those hospital monitoring tools\n&gt;&gt; I know but\n\n48\n00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:24.250\nthe bottom line here is oftentimes,\nlike a virus will cause some activity.\n\n49\n00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.320\nAnd you can determine whether or not that\nvirus really is a virus by having this\n\n50\n00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.590\nhistorical data and\nseeing how it's affecting the machine.\n\n51\n00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.480\n&gt;&gt; Well sure, and it's also real time.\n\n52\n00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.830\nThat's what we're looking at right here.\n\n53\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.920\nIt's monitoring in real time.\n\n54\n00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.730\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n55\n00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.670\n&gt;&gt; But it's cool, but you're not\ngonna be in there for this, probably.\n\n56\n00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.520\n&gt;&gt; We do have another real\ntime monitoring tool that we\n\n57\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.750\ndefinitely need to take a look at,\nright, Steve?\n\n58\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.450\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n\n59\n00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.230\nAnd this is Task Manager.\n\n60\n00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.974\nAnd it's real simple, and\nlet me show you this because if you're in.\n\n61\n00:02:55.974 --> 00:02:59.253\nWhoops, I hit the wrong button, you\ndon't want to hit that upper left hand,\n\n62\n00:02:59.253 --> 00:03:00.920\nupper right hand button.\n\n63\n00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.800\nFor Task Manager, probably the easiest\nway, you're sitting around and\n\n64\n00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.000\nyour machine is behaving weird and\n\n65\n00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.238\nyou're trying to figure out\nhow you can solve that.\n\n66\n00:03:07.238 --> 00:03:12.650\nIf you right-click on the task bar, you\ncan go here and click Start Task Manager.\n\n67\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.686\nAnd I'm gonna expand it out so you'll\nbe able to see it a little bit better.\n\n68\n00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:19.356\nBut we have different tabs here.\n\n69\n00:03:19.356 --> 00:03:24.359\nWe have Application,\nwe have Processes, we have Services,\n\n70\n00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:31.700\nwe have Performance, Networking and then\nUsers, what user activity is going on.\n\n71\n00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.240\nYou don't see an awful lot going on in\nthis machine frankly because I built it\n\n72\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.210\nrecently, and I'm not doing much with\nit except demoing what's going on.\n\n73\n00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.020\nBut you can gain a sense,\nwe actually have some Windows here.\n\n74\n00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.720\nAnd this a dual processor, no this is\na single processor virtual machine.\n\n75\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.523\nIf it were dual,\nI'd have two of those Windows, and\n\n76\n00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:54.450\nthis is how much memory I'm using.\n\n77\n00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.320\nNothing really exciting is going on here.\n\n78\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.450\nBut if there were,\nif there were things exciting going on,\n\n79\n00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.250\nthis is where I could kill it\nif I had a wayward application.\n\n80\n00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.\n\n81\n00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.573\nIf we saw, and not just like we're using\nthese tools to look for malware, but\n\n82\n00:04:11.573 --> 00:04:15.959\nsometimes legitimate applications and\nprograms can wreak havoc on our systems.\n\n83\n00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.943\nAnd if we see CPU utilization just spiking\nevery time we launch that particular\n\n84\n00:04:20.943 --> 00:04:23.293\napplication, then what we will do?\n\n85\n00:04:23.293 --> 00:04:24.514\n&gt;&gt; We could kill it.\n\n86\n00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:25.613\n&gt;&gt; Ahhh.\n[LAUGH]\n\n87\n00:04:25.613 --> 00:04:26.166\n&gt;&gt; And here,\n\n88\n00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.442\nif I want to kill the whole application,\nand\n\n89\n00:04:28.442 --> 00:04:31.470\nI'm gonna do that here because\nwe're no longer using it.\n\n90\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.690\nThe Computer Management.\n\n91\n00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.370\nI'm already into Task Manager.\n\n92\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.180\nAnd so I would just highlight it.\n\n93\n00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.330\nAnd I would go over here to End a Task,\nokay.\n\n94\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.440\nAnd it would kill that window and\nguess what?\n\n95\n00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.865\nSometimes that doesn't work.\n\n96\n00:04:45.865 --> 00:04:48.476\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it's a really stubborn\n\n97\n00:04:48.476 --> 00:04:52.251\napplication, it refuses to go away,\nor maybe it's a virus.\n\n98\n00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:57.346\nAnd so when it doesn't work, and ideally\nyou wanna close a whole application,\n\n99\n00:04:57.346 --> 00:05:01.570\nbecause there's dependencies\nassociated with applications.\n\n100\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.500\nThere are number of processes\ninvolved in a specific application.\n\n101\n00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.206\nSo you can actually go to this tab here.\n\n102\n00:05:08.206 --> 00:05:15.631\nAnd you can go through and\nyou can kill a particular application or\n\n103\n00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:20.357\napplications, excuse me, processes.\n\n104\n00:05:20.357 --> 00:05:21.141\n&gt;&gt; That are associated with\nthat particular application.\n\n105\n00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:24.280\n&gt;&gt; That are associated with\na particular application.\n\n106\n00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.800\nYou can hunt and peck, and one of\nthe ways you're gonna wanna hunt and\n\n107\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.840\npeck here is, you look over here\nat activity associated with it.\n\n108\n00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.338\nAnd we have a column here which is CPU,\n\n109\n00:05:34.338 --> 00:05:37.630\nit's identifying CPU\nusage associated with it.\n\n110\n00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.690\nAnd then memory associated with it.\n\n111\n00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.596\nSo it may be a memory hog,\nor maybe a CPU hog,\n\n112\n00:05:44.596 --> 00:05:45.600\nand-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n113\n00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.670\nAnd if you're not really sure if it\nis hogging, a term that you will hear\n\n114\n00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.330\nquite a lot in IT is creating baselines.\n\n115\n00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.720\nAnd really that's a good way to measure,\nbecause if you monitor when your system is\n\n116\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.610\nhealthy, and you know the statistics or\nmaybe network bandwidth.\n\n117\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.190\nYou can use baselines to\nmonitor a number of things.\n\n118\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.320\nBut if there's an anomaly,\nor something different,\n\n119\n00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.740\nif it's higher than usual, then we\nknow to go ahead and inspect further.\n\n120\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.790\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, and you can see on here,\n\n121\n00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.460\nnot much is going on\nobviously in this machine.\n\n122\n00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.680\nBut if I were to start for\n\n123\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.570\nexample, let me see if I can find\nsome sort of an application.\n\n124\n00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.810\nPaint, let's start Paint.\n\n125\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.710\nNow you can see there is some activity\ngoing on, Paint is coming up.\n\n126\n00:06:32.035 --> 00:06:35.170\nBoy, it came up quick cuz\nthat's just a base application.\n\n127\n00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.660\nNot much is happening with it.\n\n128\n00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.879\nBut for example, if I wanted to\nget Defender to start defending,\n\n129\n00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:50.225\nto go and do a clean sweep to\ndetermine if it's doing its full scan.\n\n130\n00:06:50.225 --> 00:06:52.900\nThat would take some\nprocessing power here.\n\n131\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.948\nAnd all of a sudden my machine slows down\nto nothing and I could actually kill,\n\n132\n00:06:56.948 --> 00:06:58.641\npotentially, Defender here.\n\n133\n00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:02.831\nOr if I had some third party product,\nI can go through and\n\n134\n00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:08.180\nkill it to save my ability to continue\nto do things with the machines.\n\n135\n00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.220\nBut these applications and these\nprocesses are all sharing same resources.\n\n136\n00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nSteve we are still in a Windows 7 machine.\n\n137\n00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.530\nWe kinda have that, on that other screen,\nit was black and green looking,\n\n138\n00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.550\nkind of that hacker green color.\n\n139\n00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.010\nBut, moving forward in\nnewer versions of Windows,\n\n140\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.120\nwe see Task Manager really\nget kind of like a facelift.\n\n141\n00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.740\nAnd it's a little more graphically\nappealing, better aesthetic if you will,\n\n142\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.900\nfor the different components there for\nour different monitoring tools, but.\n\n143\n00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n\n144\n00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.347\nAnd what I wanna do here on my machine,\nand this is,\n\n145\n00:07:44.347 --> 00:07:49.250\nwe had talked earlier about the fact that\nI'm running Windows 10 on my base machine.\n\n146\n00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.715\nIf you go and\nlook here on my desktop again,\n\n147\n00:07:52.715 --> 00:07:57.161\nyou're looking at the task manager for\nWindows 10.\n\n148\n00:07:57.161 --> 00:07:58.547\nIt is different.\n\n149\n00:07:58.547 --> 00:07:59.573\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nthat's what I was trying to get to, there.\n\n150\n00:07:59.573 --> 00:08:00.923\n&gt;&gt; It is substantially different.\n\n151\n00:08:00.923 --> 00:08:02.318\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; I like the colors that\n\n152\n00:08:02.318 --> 00:08:02.957\nthey put [LAUGH].\n\n153\n00:08:02.957 --> 00:08:05.045\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and up here we have-\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n154\n00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:06.386\nthat's girly thing but yeah, no.\n\n155\n00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:08.765\nIt does, it makes it organized, I think.\n\n156\n00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:14.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, the good thing is that\nwe have all these columns here,\n\n157\n00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.920\nand we can organize and flip through them.\n\n158\n00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.670\nRight now, it's lowest to highest, so\nwe're not seeing the highest usage.\n\n159\n00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.330\nIf I click it this way,\nclick it again it shows highest to lowest.\n\n160\n00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.490\nIf I want them alphabetical, I can click\nover here and get kind of an alphabetical-\n\n161\n00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.500\n&gt;&gt; More functional that way.\n\n162\n00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, but if I wanna see who's\nusing the most memory I click here, and\n\n163\n00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.170\nright now,\n\n164\n00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:41.863\nsomething called Service Host local system\nwhich is a bit challenging sometimes.\n\n165\n00:08:41.863 --> 00:08:44.200\n&gt;&gt; And you still have the tabs at\nthe top that you can flick through.\n\n166\n00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.054\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Like even to your users,\n\n167\n00:08:46.054 --> 00:08:49.160\nif there were users who had\nnot logged off of that system.\n\n168\n00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.910\nIf you were an administrator,\nyou can go ahead and\n\n169\n00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.010\nlog them off from this interface,\nthings like that.\n\n170\n00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.320\n&gt;&gt; One interesting difference that I\nwant to show you, and this is important\n\n171\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.260\nrelative to your system's performance,\nis what's happening at start-up?\n\n172\n00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.620\nWhat applications are starting up and\nrunning in the background?\n\n173\n00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.780\nAnd it's different in Windows\n10 than it is in Windows 7.\n\n174\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.120\nWindows 7 you would go to the command\nline, and let me show you that real quick.\n\n175\n00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.010\nI would go here to the command.\n\n176\n00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.000\n&gt;&gt; For msconfig.\n\n177\n00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.625\n&gt;&gt; And I would type in msconfig.\n\n178\n00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.040\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And up would pop this window and\n\n179\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.099\nright here is start up.\n\n180\n00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.592\nNew machine.\n\n181\n00:09:28.592 --> 00:09:29.790\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Very little is starting.\n\n182\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.597\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The only thing that's starting is,\n\n183\n00:09:31.597 --> 00:09:33.088\nand I don't have any virus-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n184\n00:09:33.088 --> 00:09:34.622\npeople love to put themselves in here.\n\n185\n00:09:34.622 --> 00:09:40.720\nYou got lurkers, like your malware, and\nyou even have some legitimate companies.\n\n186\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.050\nWho's a big offender?\n\n187\n00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.480\nDigital cameras, well, a lot of us\nhave cameras on our phones now, but\n\n188\n00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.880\nI remember they were horrible.\n\n189\n00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.390\nSkype is horrible for this.\n\n190\n00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.421\nThey wanna start as soon as\nyou power up your machine.\n\n191\n00:09:50.421 --> 00:09:53.951\nBut guess what,\nyou don't always want to start up Skype or\n\n192\n00:09:53.951 --> 00:09:56.840\nany kind of digital editing software, no.\n\n193\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.220\nSo that's where you would go ahead and\nremove those components.\n\n194\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.000\nBut sometimes, yeah,\nperfect place for malware.\n\n195\n00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.030\n&gt;&gt; Right, the things that you really\nwant to be here, first of all,\n\n196\n00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.120\nyour virus protection.\n\n197\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.690\nYou want that to fire up at startup.\n\n198\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.740\nThings like Office.\n\n199\n00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.310\nWell, if you install Office,\nguess what, it's here, like Word and\n\n200\n00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.270\nExcel and all the things.\n\n201\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.510\nDo you really need them here?\n\n202\n00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.920\n&gt;&gt; And it just slows down\nyour boot time too, right?\n\n203\n00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If I really wanted,\n\n204\n00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.200\nI'll go ahead and launch it.\n\n205\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:21.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n206\n00:10:21.885 --> 00:10:24.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the good news relative to this,\n\n207\n00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.540\nto msconfig,\nis that you can uncheck things and\n\n208\n00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.770\nif that doesn't work, if you screw it up,\nyou can always come back and check them.\n\n209\n00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.288\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So what I would do is,\n\n210\n00:10:35.288 --> 00:10:38.986\nif you have a Windows 7 machine at\nhome and it's kind of clunky and\n\n211\n00:10:38.986 --> 00:10:42.163\nnot operating very fast,\nis I would go and do msconfig.\n\n212\n00:10:42.163 --> 00:10:43.058\n&gt;&gt; Check your startup menu.\n\n213\n00:10:43.058 --> 00:10:45.398\n&gt;&gt; And I would use Google as my friend.\n\n214\n00:10:45.398 --> 00:10:45.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good advice.\n\n215\n00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.510\n&gt;&gt; And go through and identify what\nyou can safely remove from here.\n\n216\n00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:55.370\nYou'll be amazed, you will be amazed if\nit's full, you'll be amazed when you start\n\n217\n00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.820\neliminating things,\nhow much quicker it boots up.\n\n218\n00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.950\nIt's not this really\ndelayed sort of thing.\n\n219\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.270\nNow, going back to Windows 7, and\n\n220\n00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.958\nlet me see if I can get here\nto the Task Manager in it.\n\n221\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.313\nIt's different.\n\n222\n00:11:08.313 --> 00:11:15.630\nIt's different in that you actually\ndon't have a msconfig in Windows 10.\n\n223\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.530\nIt doesn't exist.\n\n224\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:22.570\nYou access that function through\nthe startup tab here in Task Manager.\n\n225\n00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.300\nAnd what you'll do is, we look through\nhere, as I mentioned the other day,\n\n226\n00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.060\nI use AVG.\n\n227\n00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.860\nThat's just me, I don't know why,\n\n228\n00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.840\nbut I don't have an awful\nlot here that is enabled.\n\n229\n00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.940\nOf course, you can go status, and you\ncan identify what's gonna start up, and\n\n230\n00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.720\nit's the enabled stuff, and\n\n231\n00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:47.090\nthen all the stuff down below is\nstuff that isn't going to start up.\n\n232\n00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.870\nAnd believe me, this machine at\nstart up is fairly slow anyway, so\n\n233\n00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.110\nI've killed off quite a bit.\n\n234\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.823\nAnd yet it's still slow, but if I enabled\nall of these things, if I enabled for\n\n235\n00:12:00.823 --> 00:12:05.551\nexample, CCleaner, which is just a utility\nto clean and I use it when I use it.\n\n236\n00:12:05.551 --> 00:12:06.664\n&gt;&gt; I've used CCleaner.\n\n237\n00:12:06.664 --> 00:12:10.493\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, then it would slow down\nbecause it would want to do that or\n\n238\n00:12:10.493 --> 00:12:12.718\nhook into Microsoft OneDrive.\n\n239\n00:12:12.718 --> 00:12:13.350\nMy God.\n\n240\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It connects into OneDrive, and\n\n241\n00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.050\nif I used OneDrive a lot,\nthat would be okay, but I really don't.\n\n242\n00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.990\n&gt;&gt; I use OneDrive a lot, and\nI don't even sync it there.\n\n243\n00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthese would all initiate at start up.\n\n244\n00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.350\nAnd if I wanna go to OneDrive,\nI click on it and I get there.\n\n245\n00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.170\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n246\n00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.430\n&gt;&gt; It may take a little while,\nbut at least I'm not having-\n\n247\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.570\n&gt;&gt; You have more control!\n\n248\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:39.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is really a benefit.\n\n249\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.020\nJust going through here to show you,\nit's much the same as\n\n250\n00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.000\nwhat we dealt with in the past with\nthe old version of Task Manager.\n\n251\n00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.010\nThe colors, kinda nice.\n\n252\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.860\nIt gets you a feeling as performance.\n\n253\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.871\n&gt;&gt; Those are the colors I like,\non the left hand side,\n\n254\n00:12:54.871 --> 00:12:56.188\njust to kind of separate it out, yeah.\n\n255\n00:12:56.188 --> 00:12:59.799\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've got CPU,\nMemory, Disk, Ethernet.\n\n256\n00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:04.888\nWe've got, in this particular case,\nbecause we're\n\n257\n00:13:04.888 --> 00:13:09.890\non a machine where I have\na number of adapters, okay?\n\n258\n00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:14.250\nSo you can see that we have\nall that application history.\n\n259\n00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.105\nIt gives us the CPU time,\nhow active is this?\n\n260\n00:13:18.105 --> 00:13:20.278\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nwith all these different components,\n\n261\n00:13:20.278 --> 00:13:23.188\nyou can see how it's a really\nuseful real-time monitoring tool.\n\n262\n00:13:23.188 --> 00:13:24.805\n&gt;&gt; We talked about start up.\n\n263\n00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:25.395\nLook at this one.\n\n264\n00:13:25.395 --> 00:13:27.003\nIt's even got my picture on it.\n\n265\n00:13:27.003 --> 00:13:29.503\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's little, but that's my picture.\n\n266\n00:13:29.503 --> 00:13:30.365\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's Steve, yeah.\n\n267\n00:13:30.365 --> 00:13:31.247\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n268\n00:13:31.247 --> 00:13:36.199\nDetails, this is just tons of information,\nwhat's running, what isn't, and\n\n269\n00:13:36.199 --> 00:13:39.917\nthis is where there's some\nrather telling things here.\n\n270\n00:13:39.917 --> 00:13:43.036\nLook at how many instances\nof Chrome I have running.\n\n271\n00:13:43.036 --> 00:13:43.873\n&gt;&gt; Jeez.\n\n272\n00:13:43.873 --> 00:13:48.987\n&gt;&gt; And that's always been a challenge with\nChrome, is that each tab is an instance.\n\n273\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:56.900\nSo it's using resources, but\nthat's just kind of the way it is.\n\n274\n00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.060\nAnd then we have services over here.\n\n275\n00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:05.350\nSo we have, this is the services tab,\nand this is kind of unique.\n\n276\n00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:09.520\nWe didn't have that in Windows 7, so\nI can actually get to select services.\n\n277\n00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.970\n&gt;&gt; We still have the services, but\nit was in a different location.\n\n278\n00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:13.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n279\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:18.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that pretty much\ngoes through Task Manager.\n\n280\n00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if we want to go ahead and\nlook at my screen, we'll go ahead and\n\n281\n00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.410\ndo a recap here, with this slide,\njust some bullet points to make sure we\n\n282\n00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.290\nunderstand when we would go ahead and\nuse these tools.\n\n283\n00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.280\nBut just know, performance monitoring\nallows you to track the use and\n\n284\n00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.903\nperformance of hardware and\n\n285\n00:14:32.903 --> 00:14:36.024\nsoftware resources like you\nguys just saw on a system.\n\n286\n00:14:36.024 --> 00:14:39.810\nIt allows you to view real-time and\nhistorical data.\n\n287\n00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.300\nRemember Steve showed you the other tool\ncalled perfmon that also lets you do that\n\n288\n00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.050\nas well so you can stop problems\nas they're happening in real-time.\n\n289\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.530\nYou could also predict future problems.\n\n290\n00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:54.400\nSo if I notice that this particular\napplication is causing my\n\n291\n00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.070\nCPU to spike every single time,\nthen that could be a precursor.\n\n292\n00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.530\nSay, look,\nmaybe my CPU is starting to fail, or\n\n293\n00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.660\nmaybe it's a problem with\nthat particular application.\n\n294\n00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.400\nWe can kind of gauge events\nbefore they happen there.\n\n295\n00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.250\nYou can conduct forensics to\nclose the vulnerabilities and\n\n296\n00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.090\nstop intrusions of the same\ntype from happening again.\n\n297\n00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.560\nPerformance monitoring also allows\nyou to decide if hardware or\n\n298\n00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.580\nsoftware needs updating, and it allows you\nto determine if unknown programs and/or\n\n299\n00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:27.320\nmalware are running, as well as allowing\nyou to monitor and restrict user access.\n\n300\n00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.970\nSo just to kind of recap there, do you\nhave any other final thoughts, Steve?\n\n301\n00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:35.380\n&gt;&gt; You know one thing that I think we have\nto take a look at, and we didn't do it,\n\n302\n00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.950\nand I don't see it really\nanywhere in the slides per se,\n\n303\n00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:44.610\nis hardening the machine by looking\nat what you don't need to be running.\n\n304\n00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.563\nAnd probably the best way to take\na real quick look at that is if we go\n\n305\n00:15:47.563 --> 00:15:48.712\ninto the Control Panel.\n\n306\n00:15:48.712 --> 00:15:52.786\nIf we can go to my machine and\nget into the Control Panel, and\n\n307\n00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:55.162\nif we go to Programs and Features.\n\n308\n00:15:55.162 --> 00:16:00.230\nFirst of all you should only have\nthe programs installed that you need.\n\n309\n00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.860\nCan we get to my screen real quick?\n\n310\n00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.000\nYeah, there we go.\n\n311\n00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.770\nAnd I don't have a lot of programs here\nbecause this is a brand new machine.\n\n312\n00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:11.220\nBut if I had some stuff that I didn't\nneed, this is where you can get rid of it,\n\n313\n00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.288\nthis is where you can uninstall it.\n\n314\n00:16:13.288 --> 00:16:14.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n315\n00:16:14.075 --> 00:16:17.225\n&gt;&gt; And you would highlight and\nyou would click like here, and\n\n316\n00:16:17.225 --> 00:16:20.695\nyou would click uninstall, I'm not gonna\ndo that because this is VMware tools, and\n\n317\n00:16:20.695 --> 00:16:21.618\nit's necessary to.\n\n318\n00:16:21.618 --> 00:16:22.325\n&gt;&gt; Useful, yep.\n\n319\n00:16:22.325 --> 00:16:24.185\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; As we're looking at the screen.\n\n320\n00:16:24.185 --> 00:16:29.885\nThe other thing that you can do here,\nand this is a place where for\n\n321\n00:16:29.885 --> 00:16:36.330\npurposes of competition you're\ngonna find that you have\n\n322\n00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.650\nstuff running, Windows components\nrunning that you really don't need.\n\n323\n00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.832\nI think we mentioned a while\nago that one of the items\n\n324\n00:16:43.832 --> 00:16:47.236\nthat was running on the machine\nthe previous machine,\n\n325\n00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:51.313\nand I had it up running here also\nis internet information server.\n\n326\n00:16:51.313 --> 00:16:56.276\nIn that fact pattern than we had,\nthey said it should be running it, but\n\n327\n00:16:56.276 --> 00:17:02.680\nthis is a Windows 7 client machine, and\nI probably, I really question running it.\n\n328\n00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.560\nAnd particularly because we've got\nsomething down here called FTP service.\n\n329\n00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.933\nAnd FTP is a problem.\n\n330\n00:17:08.933 --> 00:17:10.423\n&gt;&gt; Unsecure protocol [LAUGH].\n\n331\n00:17:10.423 --> 00:17:14.887\n&gt;&gt; What happens is that stuff that\nyou send out FTP, to an FTP server,\n\n332\n00:17:14.887 --> 00:17:19.590\nthings like you're username and\npassword are not encrypted.\n\n333\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.370\nAnd so,\nyou would probably go through here, and\n\n334\n00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:24.250\nI'm gonna just simply kind of\nget rid of some of this stuff.\n\n335\n00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.830\n&gt;&gt; So, you're hardening your system.\n\n336\n00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:26.638\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n337\n00:17:26.638 --> 00:17:33.070\nAnd, sometimes they\nmention things like media,\n\n338\n00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.580\nthis shouldn't be a media machine,\nthis is supposed to be a server.\n\n339\n00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.376\nYou're not supposed to be, so\n\n340\n00:17:37.376 --> 00:17:41.865\nwe have media features I don't know what\nwe have here but we got DVD Maker, and\n\n341\n00:17:41.865 --> 00:17:46.307\nMedia Center, and all these other stuff,\nand so maybe we don't need that.\n\n342\n00:17:46.307 --> 00:17:50.589\n&gt;&gt; And Microsoft kinda take the initiative\nto do this on their server-side\n\n343\n00:17:50.589 --> 00:17:51.870\noperating systems.\n\n344\n00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.770\nAnd that's a feature\ncalled features on demand.\n\n345\n00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.950\nSo they don't give you everything that's\navailable, you actually have to select\n\n346\n00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.130\nwhat you do want instead of going through\nand removing what you don't want.\n\n347\n00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.020\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So just a little bit different concept.\n\n348\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSome other things that as we scroll down\n\n349\n00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.130\nhere and take a look at.\n\n350\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.690\nWell Telnet server.\n\n351\n00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.660\n&gt;&gt; We talked about that\nin a previous episode.\n\n352\n00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.310\nWe said, we don't like Telnet.\n\n353\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.592\n&gt;&gt; But maybe we want a client,\nbecause although we.\n\n354\n00:18:18.592 --> 00:18:21.100\nI mean,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n355\n00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.860\n&gt;&gt; I question that, obviously.\n\n356\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.660\nDoes this need to be a PC tablet?\n\n357\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.600\nProbably a tablet PC, probably not.\n\n358\n00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.240\nI'm not sure you're going to any points\nfor that, but we might get rid of that.\n\n359\n00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.960\nMight get rid of that.\n\n360\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.060\nA gadget platform.\n\n361\n00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.074\nProbably don't need a gadget.\n\n362\n00:18:41.074 --> 00:18:45.524\n&gt;&gt; I think Microsoft even\nrecommends not using those either,\n\n363\n00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:48.566\nbecause they were a vector for malware.\n\n364\n00:18:48.566 --> 00:18:51.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd as we go down through here,\n\n365\n00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:55.160\nthere are just a bunch of services that\nyou've really gotta take a hard look.\n\n366\n00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.610\nRIP listener,\nI know that we won't want that.\n\n367\n00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:02.180\nAnd so, we go through and\nwe deselect those,\n\n368\n00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.920\nwe get rid of programs here we click okay.\n\n369\n00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.460\nThis takes several minutes, so\nit's not even worth looking at.\n\n370\n00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.570\nBut it takes several minutes, and\n\n371\n00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:14.590\nwe're hardening the machine,\nwe're turning off unnecessary services.\n\n372\n00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.501\nWe're not only turning then off here,\nwe're removing them.\n\n373\n00:19:17.501 --> 00:19:20.710\nAnd that's an important thing to do.\n\n374\n00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.050\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; And we can go through, and\n\n375\n00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:25.690\none of the things that I recommend you\ndo on your own time, not on my time,\n\n376\n00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:32.020\nis to go into the computer management,\ngetting through administrative tools.\n\n377\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.963\nAnd go out in the internet and look and\n\n378\n00:19:33.963 --> 00:19:38.307\nsee what services are not critical that\nyou don't need to be running on a machine.\n\n379\n00:19:38.307 --> 00:19:43.640\nAnd then go through and perhaps do like we\nsaw earlier, we disable those services.\n\n380\n00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.890\nAnd, because, if you don't need them,\nyou don't need them.\n\n381\n00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:47.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n382\n00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:51.060\nSo that's another avenue that you can\ngo through to harden your machine.\n\n383\n00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.730\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for showing us that\nlast tool, I do appreciate that.\n\n384\n00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.520\nI know you guys appreciate that as well.\n\n385\n00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.560\nI think that about wraps it up for\nour performance monitoring tools.\n\n386\n00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.298\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this particular episode.\n\n387\n00:20:02.298 --> 00:20:06.522\nAnd until next time, I'm gonna sign\noff as your host, Cherokee Boose, and\n\n388\n00:20:06.522 --> 00:20:08.504\nI'm Professor Steve Linthecome.\n\n389\n00:20:08.504 --> 00:20:12.353\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here for\nCyber Patriot.\n\n390\n00:20:12.353 --> 00:20:17.938\n[MUSIC]\n\n391\n00:20:17.938 --> 00:20:19.960\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Right, hi everybody.\n\n13\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.140\nSo, let's get started,\nLinux is an open source operating system.\n\n14\n00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.220\nIt was modeled after Unix.\n\n15\n00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.440\nUnix has been around forever,\nand Unix, as a matter of fact,\n\n16\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.810\nwas the first multi-user operating\nsystem that came out there.\n\n17\n00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.450\nAnd you're gonna see that when we\nlook at the architecture of it\n\n18\n00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.610\nthrough its file structure, and\nsome limitations that are associated\n\n19\n00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.690\nwith it that doesn't really\nexist in a Windows environment.\n\n20\n00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.285\nSo it can perform many of the same\nfunctions as Windows and OSX.\n\n21\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.380\nIncidentally OSX, the Apple operating\nsystem, is really, it really is Linux with\n\n22\n00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.460\nkind of a cover over it, a shield over it,\nso you're not really seeing what's going\n\n23\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.060\non behind the scenes, so its files-\n&gt;&gt; And they even use that term wall\n\n24\n00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.900\ngarden sometimes because it's\nassociated with that hardware,\n\n25\n00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.330\nlike you spoke on in a previous episode.\n\n26\n00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.550\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's built in, it's\na collaboration, it's an open source tool.\n\n27\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.630\nAnyone can use Linux, they can modify it\nand they can distribute the Linux kernel.\n\n28\n00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.690\nAnyone can develop software\nthat will run on it,\n\n29\n00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.930\nmany programmers collaborate to\ndevelop and improve Linux, and\n\n30\n00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.140\nmany Linux operating systems have\nadd-on programs that are free.\n\n31\n00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.186\nSo free is a good thing obviously.\n\n32\n00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:47.266\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah and\n\n33\n00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.287\nactually if you look at my screen here,\n\n34\n00:01:49.287 --> 00:01:51.810\nisn't this the cute little\nicon that they have?\n\n35\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.640\nThat little penguin here?\n\n36\n00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.360\nThere we go just so\nyou're familiar with that, but\n\n37\n00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.410\ndifferent distributions may\nhave their own variation there.\n\n38\n00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's right.\n\n39\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.300\nSo it refers to, as I mentioned,\na family of operating systems.\n\n40\n00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.382\nAnd there are a whole bunch of varieties\nout there, we call them distributions.\n\n41\n00:02:08.382 --> 00:02:11.043\nThere's daemon-\n&gt;&gt; Destro sometimes\n\n42\n00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:11.653\npeople-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Destro-\n\n43\n00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:14.608\n&gt;&gt; Slang [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:02:14.608 --> 00:02:17.470\n&gt;&gt; A little slag there, okay.\n\n45\n00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.175\nSo the Linux kernel is the core\ncomponent of the operating system.\n\n46\n00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:27.550\nWindows Operating System also has\na kernel, but it's not open source,\n\n47\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.288\nmeaning we can't look at the source,\nthe actual program,\n\n48\n00:02:31.288 --> 00:02:36.760\nthe content, just source, I guess.\n\n49\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.610\n&gt;&gt; The lower portion of that operating\nsystem, the bones, if you wanna say.\n\n50\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.191\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, so.\n\n51\n00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.887\nAnd we can have all kind\nof good arguments back and\n\n52\n00:02:47.887 --> 00:02:51.844\nforth about whether it's better to be open\nsource or close source like Windows is.\n\n53\n00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:56.557\nAnd the argument that it's better to be\nopen source is that you've got a whole\n\n54\n00:02:56.557 --> 00:03:00.400\nteam, a whole world of programmers\nlooking into the kernel and\n\n55\n00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.990\nthen adding programs associated with\nit at no cost ultimately to the user.\n\n56\n00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.640\nAnd with Windows we don't know\nwhere the problems are potentially.\n\n57\n00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.440\nThe security problems to be exact.\n\n58\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.860\nSo you'll notice with Windows,\n\n59\n00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.420\nperiodically Microsoft is updating\nby patching security holes.\n\n60\n00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.350\nSame thing is happening\nin a Linux environment,\n\n61\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.110\nbut you've got a lot of cooks\nin the kitchen with Linux.\n\n62\n00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.010\nI guess that would be kind\nof a way to describe it.\n\n63\n00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.710\nAnd so the whole idea here is that\n\n64\n00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.290\nthere's a committee in effect, a world\nwide committee that is improving Linux.\n\n65\n00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.860\nAnd on Microsoft's side there's just\nMicrosoft's employees that are doing it.\n\n66\n00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and you can have all sorts\nof people contribute to the forums.\n\n67\n00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.665\nA lot of support out there for\nthe open source community as well.\n\n68\n00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:53.922\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nnow an operating system like Linux, and\n\n69\n00:03:53.922 --> 00:03:56.810\nthis is true with Windows,\nor true with OSX.\n\n70\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.395\nIt manages memory, processes,\ninput, output devices.\n\n71\n00:04:01.395 --> 00:04:04.465\nWe talked about that in\nearlier sessions where we were\n\n72\n00:04:04.465 --> 00:04:05.845\nlooking at an operating system.\n\n73\n00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:08.239\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and there's a nice little graphic\nhere we can look at on my screen too\n\n74\n00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.065\nif you look at the slides here,\nwe'll see, there we go.\n\n75\n00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:15.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and when a user does\nsomething in the shell that's, and\n\n76\n00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.060\nwe refer to the shell as\nbasically a terminal.\n\n77\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.309\nWe're gonna talk more and more about that.\n\n78\n00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:25.806\nThen the user is interfacing\nwith the kernel, and\n\n79\n00:04:25.806 --> 00:04:31.540\nthe kernel translates what the user is\nasking it, the kernel to do and does it.\n\n80\n00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.750\nSo, and utilizes the CPU to\nexecute the instructions that\n\n81\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.870\nyou'll put in the terminal.\n\n82\n00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.070\nAnd that's a new term.\n\n83\n00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.720\nLook at it as the command shell in\nWindows, that DOS sort of looking shell.\n\n84\n00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.729\nAnd we're gonna take a look\nat that in the next session.\n\n85\n00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.620\nSo we've got differences here, as I\nmentioned earlier, we've got different\n\n86\n00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.411\nflavors of Linux, Ubuntu, we've got\nFedora, we've got Red Hat, WN Linux Mint.\n\n87\n00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:01.640\nThere are a whole bunch of them out there.\n\n88\n00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.250\nAnd frankly some users like some\ndistributions and some like others.\n\n89\n00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.770\nIt depends upon what you like.\n\n90\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.733\n&gt;&gt; User preference, exactly.\n\n91\n00:05:09.733 --> 00:05:12.215\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nSo it's kinda like going to the store and\n\n92\n00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:14.080\nonly having one type of bread.\n\n93\n00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.630\nWell, guess what?\n\n94\n00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.820\nYou're gonna get tired of that one type\nof bread and there isn't a choice.\n\n95\n00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.500\nHere you've got a bunch of choices.\n\n96\n00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.971\n&gt;&gt; A lot of options You can\neven change the shells for\n\n97\n00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:25.775\nthe different distributions as well.\n\n98\n00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:27.875\nSo it's really flexible in that aspect.\n\n99\n00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:29.185\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n100\n00:05:29.185 --> 00:05:33.325\nAnd we call these, the term is we don't\ncall them distributions all the time.\n\n101\n00:05:33.325 --> 00:05:34.538\nSometimes we call them flavors.\n\n102\n00:05:34.538 --> 00:05:35.924\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n103\n00:05:35.924 --> 00:05:42.320\n&gt;&gt; Which is kind of an interesting term,\nbut they're different.\n\n104\n00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.330\nThe problem is, and\n\n105\n00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.790\nmaybe that's a handicap for\nLinux with all of these different flavors,\n\n106\n00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.450\nis the commands often time that we\nuse will have subtle differences.\n\n107\n00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.910\nSo you'll be on one machine typing in\na command expecting it to do something and\n\n108\n00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.030\nyou get an error in the command.\n\n109\n00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.740\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly like you were\ntalking about even with Mac OSX.\n\n110\n00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.970\nSome of the Linux commands\nwill go ahead and\n\n111\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.610\nnatively work in Max OSX,\nsome of them won't.\n\n112\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.810\nSo you'll just need to\nkind of be aware of that.\n\n113\n00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n114\n00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.585\nSo basically the differences\nbetween the Linux flavors.\n\n115\n00:06:13.585 --> 00:06:16.490\nYou've got different\ndesktop environments and\n\n116\n00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.860\nyou can,\nthis is the neat thing about Linux.\n\n117\n00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.910\nWhen I open a Windows window it's\nthat same window no matter what.\n\n118\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.250\nIt's the GUI interface that\nMicrosoft has developed.\n\n119\n00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.675\nYeah, they differ when you have\ndifferent versions of Microsoft Windows.\n\n120\n00:06:32.675 --> 00:06:33.910\nIn some subtle ways, but\n\n121\n00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.840\nthere are a lot more similarities\nthen there are differences.\n\n122\n00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.050\n&gt;&gt; You have the main concepts.\n\n123\n00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.120\nYou've got that control panel, you've\ngot the Start menu, and if we look at\n\n124\n00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.680\nmy screen here, I don't know if we're\ngonna be able to see it very well,\n\n125\n00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.400\nbut a little bit here,\nright here kind of behind my head over,\n\n126\n00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.580\nyou can see that there's still\na menu driven interface here so\n\n127\n00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.520\nit's different, but a lot of the common\ninterface ideas are there as well.\n\n128\n00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you'll even see that as you\nwould in a Windows environment when, for\n\n129\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.162\nexample, Ubuntu.\n\n130\n00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:09.830\nIn CyberPatriot you're gonna be using\nversion 14., I think it's 14.4,\n\n131\n00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.280\nI may be wrong on that number,\nfor your competitions today.\n\n132\n00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.810\nBut down the road, Ubuntu does a really\n\n133\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.030\ncool thing is they call their versions\nby the year that they're distributed.\n\n134\n00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.662\nSo 14 is 2014.\n\n135\n00:07:24.662 --> 00:07:27.670\nI'm gonna be showing you today\nwhen we go to my desktop,\n\n136\n00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.022\nI'm gonna be showing you the most recent\nversion, and the reason I'm doing that\n\n137\n00:07:32.022 --> 00:07:36.054\nis frankly it's much easier to show you\nsome things that I want to show you.\n\n138\n00:07:36.054 --> 00:07:41.331\nAnd it's a better distribution,\nit's two years newer things get better,\n\n139\n00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:45.292\nrecognize that everybody's\nworking on all this stuff so\n\n140\n00:07:45.292 --> 00:07:48.340\nthere are improvements as we go along.\n\n141\n00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.650\nSo as I mentioned earlier we can\nhave the two different types of,\n\n142\n00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.382\nor multiple types, of GUI interfaces.\n\n143\n00:07:55.382 --> 00:07:59.940\nUbuntu uses something called Unity,\nDebian for\n\n144\n00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.560\nexample uses Gnome, and\nGnome is much more common out there.\n\n145\n00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.610\nUnity is basically what you're\ngonna get in Ubuntu, but\n\n146\n00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.930\nyou could bring up another GUI.\n\n147\n00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.700\nYou have that opportunity\nto have multiple GUI's.\n\n148\n00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.930\nUbuntu and Debian are for\ngeneral audiences.\n\n149\n00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.240\nThey mention on the slide for\n\n150\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.380\nthis particular unit that\nCali is another distribution.\n\n151\n00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.400\nAnd Cali is used for security,\nfor auditing, for forensics.\n\n152\n00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.123\nIt's a great distribution for\n\n153\n00:08:31.123 --> 00:08:36.260\nactivities that are outside the,\nsort of, general use.\n\n154\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.860\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like penetration testing.\n\n155\n00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, exactly.\n\n156\n00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.812\nThey're a security\nprofessional's best tool.\n\n157\n00:08:43.812 --> 00:08:44.780\n&gt;&gt; One stop shop.\n\n158\n00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.393\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n159\n00:08:45.393 --> 00:08:48.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda like they have different\n\n160\n00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.371\ntypes of file systems and\narchitecture support, and\n\n161\n00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:55.335\nwhat we're talking about\nhere is in Ubuntu and\n\n162\n00:08:55.335 --> 00:09:01.440\nin these other versions they have a 32-bit\nversion and they have a 64-bit version.\n\n163\n00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.020\nAs you may recall when we were talking\nabout Windows, you're seeing fewer and\n\n164\n00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.500\nfewer 32-bit machines out there.\n\n165\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.262\nAnd part of it stems from the fact that it\ncan only address somewhere between 3 and\n\n166\n00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:15.870\n4 GB of memory.\n\n167\n00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.850\nAnd as software gets more complex,\nand larger files and\n\n168\n00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.430\ndoes more things, you're gonna\nrun out of RAM at 3.5 GB of RAM.\n\n169\n00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.110\nYou're gonna wanna boost it\nto more than that, and so\n\n170\n00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.220\nyou need to go to a 64-bit\noperating system.\n\n171\n00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.980\nCurrently in your competitions,\n\n172\n00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:42.070\nyou'll find that for CyberPatriot\nthey're using 32-bit operating systems.\n\n173\n00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.845\nBut eventually they're gonna\nhave to boost up to 64-bit.\n\n174\n00:09:44.845 --> 00:09:48.000\nThey're doing that because a lot\nof schools do not have 64-bit\n\n175\n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.300\nmachines in their labs.\n\n176\n00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.720\nSo eventually you'll see it go up.\n\n177\n00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.140\nAnd then you have a different\nsort of package management and\n\n178\n00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.250\ninstallation for applications.\n\n179\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:06.090\nAnd we're gonna see that through Ubuntu\nand how we manage installing applications.\n\n180\n00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:11.060\nYou can actually do it through the GUI,\nthrough a store front we'll see that,\n\n181\n00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.140\nbut you may wanna result to the command\nline quite frankly because sometimes,\n\n182\n00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:19.900\nparticularly in the version you gonna\nbe using for the competition, the 14,\n\n183\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.540\nI think it's 14.04.\n\n184\n00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:27.550\nThat GUI interface relative to finding the\nsoftware out there is a bit challenging.\n\n185\n00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.670\nAnd that's one of the reasons why\nI'm not really showing you that\n\n186\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.260\nversion here today.\n\n187\n00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.770\nBecause the search bar, searching for\nsoftware, sometimes is there and\n\n188\n00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.350\nsometimes it isn't there.\n\n189\n00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.770\nAnd if you go out to Google for example\nand try to figure out where it went,\n\n190\n00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.550\nyou're just gonna find people saying\nthat it's there and then it isn't there.\n\n191\n00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:49.980\nAnd that's again because we're\ntalking about open source software.\n\n192\n00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.528\nIt may not be as perfect initially.\n\n193\n00:10:52.528 --> 00:10:56.350\nAs it gets better later.\n\n194\n00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:00.660\nThat's why I'm using a later version for\ntoday's demonstrations, okay.\n\n195\n00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.190\n&gt;&gt; All right, now on our last slide here,\n\n196\n00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.830\nlet's take a look here at some of\nthe differences between Windows.\n\n197\n00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.470\nWe see that, well, less expensive.\n\n198\n00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.920\nAnd essentially,\nkind of like you mentioned,\n\n199\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.770\nthe concept of you get what you pay for\nthat's pretty true for the most part.\n\n200\n00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.160\nBut really,\nLinux is kind of an exception to that.\n\n201\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.320\nYou don't get the customer support that\nyou would if you were able to call up\n\n202\n00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.680\nMicrosoft, but you do have a lot\nof other sources out there.\n\n203\n00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.541\nYou'd have to just do\na little extra research.\n\n204\n00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:36.471\nThe GUIs, and again it's natively,\nand a command line based environment,\n\n205\n00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:42.991\nbut we do have GUIs out there, so\nthat's just gonna be user preference.\n\n206\n00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:47.370\nYou've got what else, some commands\ncan only be run in the command line.\n\n207\n00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.910\nIt's less malware on Linux, so.\n\n208\n00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.670\nIt's not that Linux can't have malware,\nit's just going to be that attackers see\n\n209\n00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:00.130\nmore of a benefit because more people\nhave Microsoft operating systems.\n\n210\n00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.470\nSo they're gonna go after\nthose Microsoft systems and\n\n211\n00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.880\ncertain hardware is not\nbuilt to work with Linux,\n\n212\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.040\nlike you were just mentioning Steve,\nwe might see some conflicting parts there.\n\n213\n00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.520\n&gt;&gt; Right what you might find\nis if you have a product, for\n\n214\n00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.640\nexample, that is not commonplace and\nthe product manufacturer\n\n215\n00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.250\nhas not developed a driver that\nwill work in a Linux environment.\n\n216\n00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.430\nThen you may not be able\nto use that hardware.\n\n217\n00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.470\nJust repeating more or\nless what you said about malware,\n\n218\n00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.330\nCherokee mentioned that you don't\nsee it as often and that's accurate.\n\n219\n00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.900\nBut that doesn't mean that it doesn't\nhave issues relative to malware.\n\n220\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.940\nTruth is that all operating systems,\n\n221\n00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.540\nbecause you're talking about\nmillions of lines of code.\n\n222\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.430\n&gt;&gt; Coding, yeah.\n\n223\n00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, millions and millions.\n\n224\n00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:52.010\nAnd there can be mistakes or just-\n&gt;&gt; Not even the state.\n\n225\n00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.670\nIt's just that someone else is able\nto see a vulnerability that that\n\n226\n00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:56.430\ncoder didn't see.\n\n227\n00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:01.218\nIt wasn't that they did it wrong,\nit's just, it's a cat and mouse game.\n\n228\n00:13:01.218 --> 00:13:06.545\n&gt;&gt; Right, but the main thing here is, and\nrelative to people that are out there\n\n229\n00:13:06.545 --> 00:13:12.055\nthat are trying to break into computers,\nBill Gates is a pretty novel target.\n\n230\n00:13:13.185 --> 00:13:17.041\nHe's not as beloved as\nperhaps Linus was or is.\n\n231\n00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:23.040\nAnd the hacker community generally focuses\non where they can make the most impact.\n\n232\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.930\nAnd the truth is you\ncan do that at Windows.\n\n233\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:31.710\nI mean there are just so\nmany people out there using Windows and\n\n234\n00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.940\nit's got more of a target\nassociated with it.\n\n235\n00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.940\n&gt;&gt; One thing I don't see on the list\nthat we might wanna mention is\n\n236\n00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:41.490\nthe footprint for\nour hardware requirements, so.\n\n237\n00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.160\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n238\n00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:50.190\nWindows, they keep expanding its uses,\nits functions, what it does.\n\n239\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.690\nAnd so\nits hardware requirements are increasing.\n\n240\n00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.450\nAnd on a current version of Linux,\nfor example, of Ubuntu,\n\n241\n00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:02.190\nyou could probably successfully run it and\ndo a lot of things with 1 GB of memory.\n\n242\n00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.470\nTry to run Windows 10 with 1 GB of memory.\n\n243\n00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.650\nIt's not a very-\n&gt;&gt; Let us know how that works out for you.\n\n244\n00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Microsoft might suggest to you\nin their hardware requirements, and\n\n245\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:17.310\nI don't know what they are for\nWindows 10, but they may be\n\n246\n00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.392\nadvertising it as you can get by with 2\nGB of memory, but I wouldn't do that.\n\n247\n00:14:21.392 --> 00:14:24.110\nYou're gonna see that round\nspinning thing an awful lot.\n\n248\n00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.535\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n249\n00:14:25.535 --> 00:14:29.477\n&gt;&gt; Now the next slide that we have is\nactually defining some of the similarities\n\n250\n00:14:29.477 --> 00:14:32.770\nwhen we compare Linux systems\nto Windows systems here.\n\n251\n00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:37.340\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you noticed that when we\nwent through Windows and looked at Windows\n\n252\n00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.740\n7 for example, and if you go through\nthe services it has server service.\n\n253\n00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:47.450\nSo as I mentioned earlier you can convert,\nin effect, your Windows workstation,\n\n254\n00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:53.260\nyour Windows 7 machine to also be a server\nso it's both a workstation and a server.\n\n255\n00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.230\nSimply by sharing out a folder, or\n\n256\n00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:00.330\nhaving a printer that's connected to it,\nhave it shared out.\n\n257\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.545\nIt becomes a server serving\nother users across your network.\n\n258\n00:15:03.545 --> 00:15:06.909\n&gt;&gt; And Steve you mentioned one term\nwhen you said services like in our\n\n259\n00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:10.080\nWindows Operating System\nthat you've showed us.\n\n260\n00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.910\nIt's kind of weird how Linux\ncalls them daemons here.\n\n261\n00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And you guys will notice that the Linux\n\n262\n00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.230\nterminology is a little bit out there,\nbut that's because whomever created that\n\n263\n00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:24.150\noperating system has the right to name\ntheir components whatever they want,\n\n264\n00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.650\nso as you're going along you'll see\nsome pretty funny ones out there.\n\n265\n00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.970\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nnow from a workstation perspective,\n\n266\n00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.520\nthey can perform similar functions.\n\n267\n00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.840\nFor example, in the Ubuntu distribution\nthat we have, it has LibreOffice in it.\n\n268\n00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.750\nSo you can do things like\nthe equivalent of Word,\n\n269\n00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:47.290\nthe equivalent of PowerPoint,\nand the equivalent of Excel.\n\n270\n00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.880\nAnd they're free, they're absolutely free.\n\n271\n00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.930\nAnd you can, with existing Word files,\nor Excel files or PowerPoint files,\n\n272\n00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.434\nyou can actually go in and\nopen them and modify.\n\n273\n00:15:56.434 --> 00:16:00.797\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if we look at the slide here,\nit looks like this LibreOffice,\n\n274\n00:16:00.797 --> 00:16:03.444\npersonally I've never used it before, but\n\n275\n00:16:03.444 --> 00:16:08.185\nit looks a little more user friendly than\nthe integrated that VI editor there.\n\n276\n00:16:08.185 --> 00:16:11.035\nSo that's a little bit complicated,\n\n277\n00:16:11.035 --> 00:16:14.075\nso hopefully these are a little\nmore user friendly.\n\n278\n00:16:14.075 --> 00:16:15.267\n&gt;&gt; And they're free.\n\n279\n00:16:15.267 --> 00:16:16.635\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah that's cool.\n\n280\n00:16:16.635 --> 00:16:18.985\n&gt;&gt; And it's a stable operating system,\n\n281\n00:16:18.985 --> 00:16:25.150\nboth Ubuntu and\nWindows are viewed as stable.\n\n282\n00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:29.350\nNow you may periodically\nfind a new distribution of\n\n283\n00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.590\na Linux environment that\nhas some stability issues.\n\n284\n00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:36.658\nAnd often times when the new distribution\ncomes out it's not viewed as stable.\n\n285\n00:16:36.658 --> 00:16:39.731\nIt's viewed as-\n&gt;&gt; Good point because sometimes even on\n\n286\n00:16:39.731 --> 00:16:43.949\nthat developer's page they might even have\na beta version of that operating system,\n\n287\n00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:45.080\nso be careful of that.\n\n288\n00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.020\nIf you see that term beta, it means\nthat it's still in that testing phase so\n\n289\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.070\nit's kind of like a user beware.\n\n290\n00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.750\nIt's like a little disclaimer, okay.\n\n291\n00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:57.310\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthey're really pretty much similar,\n\n292\n00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.290\nI guess if I had to characterize it.\n\n293\n00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:04.116\nIt won't be that challenging when\nyou're in a GUI environment,\n\n294\n00:17:04.116 --> 00:17:07.904\njumping from Windows or\nMAC OS, over into Ubuntu.\n\n295\n00:17:07.904 --> 00:17:12.919\nBecause what the Ubuntu people have\ndone effectively with this GUI,\n\n296\n00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:18.460\nis they aligned it with a GUI that is\nvery similar in its function to Windows.\n\n297\n00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.969\nSo I don't think you'll\nhave much of a problem,\n\n298\n00:17:21.969 --> 00:17:27.300\nboth of them have Windows and\nLinux have to be patched periodically.\n\n299\n00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:33.680\nThey've got firewalls that you can\ninstall and get up and running.\n\n300\n00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.800\nThey've got similar password policies.\n\n301\n00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.300\nI know that we looked\nthe other day at passwords.\n\n302\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.080\nWhat we wanna make sure with password\npolicies is how many times you can try and\n\n303\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.140\nlog on, and\n\n304\n00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.610\na failure results in your account\nbeing locked, those sorts of things.\n\n305\n00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.369\n&gt;&gt; And permissions also, they have those,\njust a little different.\n\n306\n00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:52.742\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So similarities, differences.\n\n307\n00:17:52.742 --> 00:17:56.310\n&gt;&gt; I think that about wraps it up for\nthis particular episode.\n\n308\n00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.928\nIt looks like we're out of time here.\n\n309\n00:17:57.928 --> 00:18:00.620\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n310\n00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.640\nsign off as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n311\n00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.880\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:15.960\n&gt;&gt; Welcome cyber patriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n7\n00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.210\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.340\nIn this episode, we're gonna be looking\nat Ubuntu terminology and concepts.\n\n9\n00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.651\nWith us today to go ahead and\ndemonstrate and\n\n10\n00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.784\nexplain what this all means\nis Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n11\n00:00:29.784 --> 00:00:30.797\nThank you for joining us, Steve.\n\n12\n00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.050\n&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.\n\n13\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.446\nWhat we're gonna be doing is we're gonna\nbe looking at a series of slides where\n\n14\n00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:37.824\nwe're gonna talk about\ndifferent aspects of Ubuntu.\n\n15\n00:00:37.824 --> 00:00:42.477\nAnd we're actually gonna do a little\nbit of a comparison to Windows\n\n16\n00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:46.393\nbecause you're all probably\ncomfortable in Windows.\n\n17\n00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:50.140\nAnd it's a good way to kind of go and\nlook and approach these things.\n\n18\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.800\nSo let's get to the first slide and this\nfirst slide talks about account types.\n\n19\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.392\nAnd in Windows, we probably make\nit a little bit more challenging.\n\n20\n00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:04.420\nIn Ubuntu in the Linux environment,\nthey make it simple.\n\n21\n00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.420\nWe've got two types of people accounts,\nwe'll call them that, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.700\nWe have users and we have root.\n\n23\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.670\nThe equivalent of root in a Windows\nenvironment is that administrator\n\n24\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.400\naccount, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.750\nSo when you install Windows 7 for example,\nif you look through the list of users,\n\n26\n00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.500\nyou would see that there is\nan administrator account there.\n\n27\n00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.030\nNow you don't use that\nadministrators account.\n\n28\n00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.721\nIt is basically an account\nthat is part of the install.\n\n29\n00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:34.330\nYou don't even know what the password is.\n\n30\n00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.808\nWhen you log in,\nyou're logging in as your original user.\n\n31\n00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:42.310\nThat is a user in your name,\nor however you typed in there\n\n32\n00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.090\nwhen you did the install, and\nthey have administrative rights.\n\n33\n00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.210\nAll other users beyond, how can I\ndescribe it and have it make sense?\n\n34\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.768\nThe same in a Windows environment\nas in a Ubuntu environment,\n\n35\n00:01:57.768 --> 00:02:01.960\nall of you are users except for\nthe administrator.\n\n36\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.690\nMake sense?\n\n37\n00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.298\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what you're saying is the root\nis in a Linux system is going to be\n\n38\n00:02:06.298 --> 00:02:09.687\nthe equivalent of administrator\nin our Windows operating system.\n\n39\n00:02:09.687 --> 00:02:12.640\nSo we see those higher privileges\nwith the root account.\n\n40\n00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.210\n&gt;&gt; Right, and unfortunately,\n\n41\n00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.060\nwe chose to call it root because when\nwe're talking about directories,\n\n42\n00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.370\nthere is a term that's called root\nalso but we didn't have a choice.\n\n43\n00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.843\nAs Cherokee mentioned in the previous\ndemonstration, the previous video,\n\n44\n00:02:26.843 --> 00:02:29.111\nthe people that got to pick the names for\n\n45\n00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:31.957\nthese things are the people\nthat invented them.\n\n46\n00:02:31.957 --> 00:02:36.896\nSo we're stuck with root and incidentally,\nif you're ever on a Ubuntu or\n\n47\n00:02:36.896 --> 00:02:42.152\nany Linux system and you want to check and\nsee whether or not you could break in,\n\n48\n00:02:42.152 --> 00:02:46.155\nperhaps the easiest way to do\nthat is to try to log in as root.\n\n49\n00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:51.478\nAnd then use as your password toor,\nt-o-o-r, all lower case.\n\n50\n00:02:51.478 --> 00:02:55.261\n&gt;&gt; And incidentally root is lower case and\nLinux is case sensitive.\n\n51\n00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:57.620\nSo you gotta be concerned about that.\n\n52\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.850\nBecause that's your standard play mode\nrelative to you wanting to go in as root,\n\n53\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.880\nutilizing root as your username and\ntoor as your password.\n\n54\n00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.679\nI gave that piece of information because\nwhile machines that are in production\n\n55\n00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.785\nshouldn't be set up in that manner\nwith that simple a password,\n\n56\n00:03:13.785 --> 00:03:15.356\nit's just easier often times.\n\n57\n00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:20.307\nSo when you're in an environment where\nyou're playing or you're learning,\n\n58\n00:03:20.307 --> 00:03:25.850\na lot of times that's the username and\npassword that are used for the account.\n\n59\n00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.060\nSo again, root is like an administrator\nin a Windows environment.\n\n60\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.480\nYou can have multiple root accounts,\n\n61\n00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.770\neffectively by raising that\nparticular user's right to\n\n62\n00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.760\nan effectively a root level, in terms of\npermissions and we'll talk about that.\n\n63\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.250\nRoot actions require when\nyou're going through and\n\n64\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.450\nyou decide that you want to do a root\naction, and that might be downloading and\n\n65\n00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.340\ninstalling a program, for example.\n\n66\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.808\nYou're going to be cued for your password.\n\n67\n00:03:56.808 --> 00:04:00.220\nYou're gonna cued for your password so\nthat's one of the reasons why toor\n\n68\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.630\nis really nice cuz it's easy to\ntype in your play environment.\n\n69\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.240\nAnd we get in to the same sort\nof thing that we talked about\n\n70\n00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.470\nearlier about authentication and\nauthorization.\n\n71\n00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.720\nYou may be authenticated by\nthe operating system, effectively.\n\n72\n00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.220\nBut you may not be able to do certain\nthings until your authorized and\n\n73\n00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.160\nso it's much the same.\n\n74\n00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.790\nAnd again, in a Linux environment,\nyou'll see this quite commonly.\n\n75\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.860\nWhen we're in the GUI environment, and\nI try to do something that requires that\n\n76\n00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.760\nroot level capability of doing it in terms\nof permission, up will pop a box and\n\n77\n00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.472\nit will ask me for my password.\n\n78\n00:04:37.472 --> 00:04:42.000\nIf I'm in the command line,\nwe do a command, it's called SUDO and\n\n79\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.910\nbasically it queues-\n&gt;&gt; Super user do?\n\n80\n00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.755\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n81\n00:04:46.755 --> 00:04:48.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Super user do.\n\n82\n00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.422\nAnd, basically what it does is it\ncues the operating system that,\n\n83\n00:04:53.422 --> 00:04:57.874\nI wanna do this at a higher level,\na higher permission level and\n\n84\n00:04:57.874 --> 00:05:00.311\nso I'll be asked for my password.\n\n85\n00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:03.817\nAnd incidentally, when were in\nthat command line as you'll see,\n\n86\n00:05:03.817 --> 00:05:07.259\nwhen I type my password,\nthere isn't return of information, so\n\n87\n00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.451\nit looks like im doing nothing\nas I'm punching the keys in but\n\n88\n00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:13.620\nI'm really typing in my password\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n89\n00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the slides here.\n\n90\n00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.330\nWe have our Ubuntu file system, so if you\nwanna go ahead and explain that, Steve?\n\n91\n00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay, going through here,\nthe difference, and\n\n92\n00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.760\nI'm gonna show this to you in actuality.\n\n93\n00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.372\nBut first of all, Unix was designed\nto be a multiuser operating system,\n\n94\n00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:35.161\nmeaning we have different users\nusing the operating system.\n\n95\n00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:39.817\nAnd they would typically connect up\nthroughout I'll characterize it as kind of\n\n96\n00:05:39.817 --> 00:05:43.289\na dumb terminal, it just had a screen and\nit had a keyboard,\n\n97\n00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.155\nno real smarts there but\nthey were all effectively logging in.\n\n98\n00:05:47.155 --> 00:05:54.780\nMultiple people at multiple dumb\nterminals were logging into the server\n\n99\n00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.280\nand as a consequence of that, there's\na little bit different file structure.\n\n100\n00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.240\nIn Windows,\n\n101\n00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.350\nWindows was originally designed as\na single user operating system.\n\n102\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.650\nEven before that, DOS was designed\nas a single user operating system.\n\n103\n00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.300\nAnd so when we enter the file structure,\nthe file folder structure in Windows,\n\n104\n00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.070\nwe typically enter a drive letter and\nthat drive letter is typically C.\n\n105\n00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.580\nAnd in Linux that's not the case.\n\n106\n00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.170\nBasically, since it's\na multiuser operating system,\n\n107\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.200\nthey want to make sure the file and\n\n108\n00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.510\nfolder structure is such that you enter\nyour user area as opposed to the root.\n\n109\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.740\nThe root of this magical tree\nthat defines our drive and\n\n110\n00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.960\nfile structure and so\nthat's an important difference, okay.\n\n111\n00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.200\nSo what we're gonna do is I'm actually\ngonna switch out of the slides and\n\n112\n00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.140\nI'm gonna go into my machine and try to\ndo a little bit of a comparison for you.\n\n113\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.146\nFirst, I've gotta type in,\nas you can see, this is Ubuntu.\n\n114\n00:06:56.146 --> 00:07:02.020\nAnd I mentioned in an earlier video\nthat I'm gonna be using Ubuntu 16.04.\n\n115\n00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.492\nThe year is 2016.\n\n116\n00:07:04.492 --> 00:07:08.130\nThe version number is .04.\n\n117\n00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:13.051\nThis is a 64-bit version, kind of want to\ntake advantage relative to the speed of\n\n118\n00:07:13.051 --> 00:07:15.388\nhaving a 64-bit operating system.\n\n119\n00:07:15.388 --> 00:07:18.830\nThey typically operate a little\nfaster in this virtual environment.\n\n120\n00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.089\nSo when you're doing your competition,\nyou're gonna be using,\n\n121\n00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:29.080\nI think it's 1404, 14.04, and\na 32-bit version, so it's more clunky.\n\n122\n00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.215\nThis is less clunky, so\nlet me type in my password.\n\n123\n00:07:32.215 --> 00:07:37.740\n[BLANK AUDIO] Now at this point,\n\n124\n00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.210\nthis account is a administrator style\naccount, it's effectively a root account.\n\n125\n00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.200\nAnd what I have up here is I have\n\n126\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.110\na GUI interface that you\ncan see here on the left.\n\n127\n00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.840\nAnd this is the current folder structure,\nand then this is for the user,\n\n128\n00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:02.500\nthe folder the outside encasement is for\nthe user professor.\n\n129\n00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.073\nOkay?\n\n130\n00:08:03.073 --> 00:08:03.879\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Make sense?\n\n131\n00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:06.769\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then we have over here a terminal\n\n132\n00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:10.232\nwindow, this is much the same\nas we see in Windows.\n\n133\n00:08:10.232 --> 00:08:14.190\nAnd you can see that it's giving me,\nhere to the left,\n\n134\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:19.810\nit's identifying the user and\nit's professor@professor-virtualbox.\n\n135\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.870\nWe're inside a virtual box, as I told you.\n\n136\n00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.410\nI really like this environment much\nbetter than the VMware player.\n\n137\n00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.313\nIt provides some\ncapabilities like snapshots.\n\n138\n00:08:29.313 --> 00:08:29.928\n&gt;&gt; I love snapshots.\n\n139\n00:08:29.928 --> 00:08:32.033\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can go through, and\n\n140\n00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:34.535\nI can do some things to\nthis operating system,\n\n141\n00:08:34.535 --> 00:08:36.730\ninstall stuff and take a snapshot of it.\n\n142\n00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.907\nAnd if it's problematic,\nI can always revert back to where it was.\n\n143\n00:08:39.907 --> 00:08:43.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's kinda like taking\na screenshot but of the entire system.\n\n144\n00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.080\nSo for that point in time, it saves\nall your settings so that If you move\n\n145\n00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.750\nforward and you mess something up, you\nkind of have like some insurance there.\n\n146\n00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nthe reason that I'm told that CyberPatriot\n\n147\n00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.970\ndoesn't want to go to VirtualBox,\nis they're concerned about security,\n\n148\n00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.330\nthat you could take snapshots at various\nlevels when you're doing things.\n\n149\n00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:06.380\nAnd if you were in the competition,\nand let's say you took a snapshot and\n\n150\n00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.080\nthen you deleted an application or\na user or\n\n151\n00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.180\nsomething and then you get that bad sound\nmeaning you've done something wrong.\n\n152\n00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay, to revert back to the previous.\n\n153\n00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.180\n&gt;&gt; Then you could revert\nback to the previous.\n\n154\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.810\nSo that's their rationale for using it.\n\n155\n00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.289\nNow what I'm also gonna\ndo at the same time,\n\n156\n00:09:23.289 --> 00:09:28.103\nis I'm gonna bring up my Windows machine,\nmy Windows 10.\n\n157\n00:09:28.103 --> 00:09:30.650\nMy host machine and we have guest hosts.\n\n158\n00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.210\nRemember that relationship with operating\nsystems in a virtual environment.\n\n159\n00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.927\nAnd I'm also gonna bring\nup a command line and\n\n160\n00:09:36.927 --> 00:09:39.867\nlet me see if I can slide\nthem around a little bit.\n\n161\n00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:42.670\n&gt;&gt; So you're comparing the two\ndifferent command interfaces.\n\n162\n00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:47.690\n&gt;&gt; So what I'm gonna do is kind of lay\nthe windows folder and file structure over\n\n163\n00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:54.640\nthe folder view that we have in Ubuntu and\ndo the same thing here on this side.\n\n164\n00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.860\nThis is the command line side.\n\n165\n00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.095\nSo as you can see here on the left,\nwe have the folder and\n\n166\n00:10:01.095 --> 00:10:03.625\nfile structure in a Windows environment.\n\n167\n00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:07.436\nOn the right, we have the DOS box,\nthat's really kind of what it is because\n\n168\n00:10:07.436 --> 00:10:10.837\nthat's what we call it if you used\nto use DOS this is where you were.\n\n169\n00:10:10.837 --> 00:10:16.070\nIf you look over here on the left, you'll\nsee that there is a user's folder here.\n\n170\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.050\nAnd if I click on that,\none of the users here is Steve.\n\n171\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.020\nThat's me, okay.\n\n172\n00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:27.880\nSo if I click on that,\nnow there's a little more stuff here,\n\n173\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.010\nbut much the same as we saw in that\nUbuntu view of the professor folder\n\n174\n00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.340\nwith specific folders in there.\n\n175\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.350\nThis would be, I'm sure if\nMicrosoft could go back through and\n\n176\n00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.950\nredesign the structure, they probably\nwould do it in the same manner\n\n177\n00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.720\nthat Linux has done, because that-\n&gt;&gt; Linux treats everything like\n\n178\n00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.460\na file, right?\n\n179\n00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:53.270\n&gt;&gt; First of all, Linux treats everything\nlike a file, that's absolutely true.\n\n180\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.270\nBut Microsoft, in most instances,\ntreats everything as a file.\n\n181\n00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.470\nWe wouldn't have the ability\nof an ordinary user for\n\n182\n00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.440\nexample to go directly to the root of C.\n\n183\n00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.550\nThat's not a good thing\nwhen you think about it.\n\n184\n00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.236\nBecause an ordinary user could go in there\nand, perhaps monkey around a bit and\n\n185\n00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:12.518\nscrew up the whole operating system.\n\n186\n00:11:12.518 --> 00:11:18.350\nBut we are where we are and\nMicrosoft has kept that same structure.\n\n187\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:25.160\nSo, for example here,\nright now I'm in the user Steve directory.\n\n188\n00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.380\nAnd this is the command line view\nthat we would see in Windows.\n\n189\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.840\nAnd if I want to change,\nlet's say I want to go to the root of C,\n\n190\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.720\nI would do a cd dot dot.\n\n191\n00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.838\nChange directory and you can see that\nwe drop down to the user folder and\n\n192\n00:11:40.838 --> 00:11:44.844\nif we wanna go down to the root\nof C we would do cd dot dot.\n\n193\n00:11:44.844 --> 00:11:49.396\nAnd that gets us right down the C and\nif we do a dir,\n\n194\n00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:55.560\nI'm gonna do these exact same\ncommands in Ubuntu in a minute.\n\n195\n00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.815\nBut you can see,\nwe can see the folders and the files.\n\n196\n00:11:57.815 --> 00:11:58.585\n&gt;&gt; The directory structure.\n\n197\n00:11:58.585 --> 00:12:01.795\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\na little bit of confusion perhaps,\n\n198\n00:12:01.795 --> 00:12:05.985\na directory is the same as folder,\nfile is the same as file.\n\n199\n00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:07.800\nThat's the good news.\n\n200\n00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.355\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because the term earlier on,\n\n201\n00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:14.175\nway back in the DOS days, we didn't\nhave folders, we had directories.\n\n202\n00:12:14.175 --> 00:12:17.015\nAnd the reason we didn't have folders is\nbecause we didn't have a GUI that showed\n\n203\n00:12:17.015 --> 00:12:18.235\na nice little folder.\n\n204\n00:12:18.235 --> 00:12:21.137\nIt's hard to show a directory and\nwhat comes to mind?\n\n205\n00:12:21.137 --> 00:12:23.830\nNothing, really, but\nwe understand file cabinets.\n\n206\n00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.520\nAnd we understand that file\ncabinets have folders in them.\n\n207\n00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.191\nSo a file cabinet in\nthis sort of structure\n\n208\n00:12:31.191 --> 00:12:35.370\nwould be basically, your C drive.\n\n209\n00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.630\nI mean, in this sort of structure,\nit'd be your C drive.\n\n210\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.089\nAnd then the files inside of that folder,\n\n211\n00:12:40.089 --> 00:12:44.173\nI mean the folders inside of that\nfile cabinet would be your folders.\n\n212\n00:12:44.173 --> 00:12:46.343\nAnd then for example the documents,\n\n213\n00:12:46.343 --> 00:12:50.870\nthe individual documents they would\nbe files inside of the folder.\n\n214\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.769\nSame sort of structure that\nwere gonna see in Ubuntu.\n\n215\n00:12:54.769 --> 00:13:02.770\nAnd you know from here I can run all\nkinds of commands, I could do what else?\n\n216\n00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.310\nI'm trying to think of a good command,\nE-D-L-I-N.\n\n217\n00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.790\nI don't know whether EDLINs still there.\n\n218\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:07.890\nNo, it's not there.\n\n219\n00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.900\nThat used to be the old editor in DOS.\n\n220\n00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:17.310\nBut I can go through and run programs\nfrom here, do a variety of things.\n\n221\n00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.820\n&gt;&gt; The one thing you've always got is\nHelp to bring command prompt Windows.\n\n222\n00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.870\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n223\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.920\nSo you can do a variety of things here.\n\n224\n00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.920\nSame thing you can do\nin a Linux environment.\n\n225\n00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.940\nSo let me go to the Linux environment.\n\n226\n00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.090\nAnd here we are,\n\n227\n00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.540\nlooks very similar to what we\nare looking at in the DOS environment.\n\n228\n00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.670\nSo we can do the same sort of thing.\n\n229\n00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.530\nNow way back when, there was this,\n\n230\n00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.810\nhow can I describe it,\nanti-Windows sentiment and\n\n231\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:52.240\nit's gradually disappearing\nin a Linux environment.\n\n232\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.280\nSo, I can type for example here, dir and\n\n233\n00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.536\nI get a directory,\nI get a list of things in here.\n\n234\n00:14:00.536 --> 00:14:01.878\nNow, dame command,\n\n235\n00:14:01.878 --> 00:14:05.920\nnut there are other commands that\nI can use to do the same thing.\n\n236\n00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:11.940\nI can use ls and that gives me some\ncolor coding that dir doesn't.\n\n237\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.370\nSo you probably, when you're gonna\noperate on a Linux environment,\n\n238\n00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:18.510\nyou wanna know what the heck\nis inside of a folder.\n\n239\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.020\nYou're gonna wanna use ls,\n\n240\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:26.450\nbecause it differentiates between\nwhat are other folders, for example.\n\n241\n00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.190\nAnd what are programs or other things.\n\n242\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.302\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n243\n00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:32.820\nLooks like your introducing us here.\n\n244\n00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.160\nWe do have another segment where we\ngo a little bit more in depth, but\n\n245\n00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.640\none thing I did wanna note was for\npackage installations.\n\n246\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.567\nSo for adding and removing software,\nhow would that be different, Steve?\n\n247\n00:14:43.567 --> 00:14:47.188\n&gt;&gt; Well first of all, the cool\nthing here is you've got a GUI for\n\n248\n00:14:47.188 --> 00:14:50.620\nthose of you who like to be\ninvolved in a GUI environment.\n\n249\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.870\nSo, you can click down here.\n\n250\n00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:56.870\nThis is the Ubuntu Software Store and\nthey call\n\n251\n00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.890\nit the Software Center, but it's kind of a\nstore where you can actually buy software.\n\n252\n00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:02.410\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n253\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:07.020\n&gt;&gt; And a couple of the things that we're\ngonna be looking at down the road.\n\n254\n00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.202\nLet me give you an example.\n\n255\n00:15:13.693 --> 00:15:14.229\nLet me see,\n\n256\n00:15:14.229 --> 00:15:17.570\nwhat would be a good example of something\nthat we would probably install?\n\n257\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.610\n&gt;&gt; Some kind of,\nwhat about one of those text editors?\n\n258\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.789\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well we'll just pick one here.\n\n259\n00:15:24.789 --> 00:15:26.570\nHow about a DOS box emulator?\n\n260\n00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.360\nSo we could go here and we could click on.\n\n261\n00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.010\nBecause I like DOS, and\nmaybe it's the same sort of thing.\n\n262\n00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.230\nSo right now what's happening is\nit's going out to the store, and\n\n263\n00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.360\nit's seeing that there is this\nthing that I could install.\n\n264\n00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.515\nNotice there's not a price on it and\nnotice that there are very few reviews.\n\n265\n00:15:44.515 --> 00:15:48.318\nBut what you would go through here\nis you would click install and\n\n266\n00:15:48.318 --> 00:15:51.904\nthis is very similar,\nwe do the same thing with our iphone,\n\n267\n00:15:51.904 --> 00:15:53.805\nwe do the same thing with-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n268\n00:15:53.805 --> 00:15:54.351\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n269\n00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:58.284\nI don't, in a Windows environment I\ncan tell you that I hardly ever go to\n\n270\n00:15:58.284 --> 00:15:59.410\nthe Windows store.\n\n271\n00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:00.784\nI don't know anybody who\ngoes to the window store.\n\n272\n00:16:00.784 --> 00:16:01.550\n&gt;&gt; Likewise.\n\n273\n00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but this is the Ubuntu store.\n\n274\n00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.040\nAnd you notice that it prompts me for\na password.\n\n275\n00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.160\nSo I've got to type in my password in\norder to bring this program in and\n\n276\n00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.710\ninstall it.\n\n277\n00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:17.200\nAnd so it's\n&gt;&gt; Now installed.\n\n278\n00:16:21.346 --> 00:16:23.449\n&gt;&gt; Now I don't know why it popped up and\nsaid it's now installed,\n\n279\n00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:26.290\ncuz that was a little early, but-\n&gt;&gt; That was real fast.\n\n280\n00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:27.900\nSo it is now installed.\n\n281\n00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.835\nAnd down here you can see,\nhere it added it right there.\n\n282\n00:16:32.835 --> 00:16:38.040\n&gt;&gt; The icon to launch that.\n&gt;&gt; So if I click on the icon, There it is.\n\n283\n00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.660\n&gt;&gt; Very neat.\n\n284\n00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.165\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's pretty cool, right?\n\n285\n00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n286\n00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.935\nAnd for removing,\nwould it be a similar process, or\n\n287\n00:16:44.935 --> 00:16:47.715\nobviously we wouldn't be\nable to go do that store.\n\n288\n00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:52.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, but\nwe'll hit on removal down the road.\n\n289\n00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.000\nBasically, you can do it\nthrough the GUI interface also.\n\n290\n00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.830\n&gt;&gt; Nice, so it's not, we've got this,\nmaybe you might have some pre-conceptual\n\n291\n00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.982\nidea that it's just gonna\nbe command line strictly.\n\n292\n00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:07.011\nBut in this environment,\nyou do see some options, and thank you for\n\n293\n00:17:07.011 --> 00:17:07.980\nshowing us, Steve.\n\n294\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.774\nAnd thank you guys for hanging in there\nwith us, I think we're gonna go ahead and\n\n295\n00:17:11.774 --> 00:17:13.430\nwrap up this particular episode.\n\n296\n00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.290\nBut don't go anywhere,\nwe still have some Ubuntu coming your way.\n\n297\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.700\nSo for this particular episode, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and sign off, as your host,\n\n298\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.510\nCherokee Boose,\n&gt;&gt; and I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n299\n00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.036\n&gt;&gt; Signing off for CyberPatriot.\n\n300\n00:17:24.036 --> 00:17:31.127\n[MUSIC]\n\n301\n00:17:31.127 --> 00:17:35.904\n&gt;&gt;

Welcome cyber patriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.720\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.370\nIn this episode, we're gonna be looking at\nan introduction to Ubuntu command lines\n\n7\n00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.600\nand thank you for joining us.\n\n8\n00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.220\nAnd we also have a special guest,\nProfessor Steve Linthicum to go ahead and\n\n9\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.350\nhelp us with this topic.\n\n10\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.350\nThank you Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.050\n&gt;&gt; Hi everybody.\n\n12\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.210\nYes.\nWe're gonna be looking at command line and\n\n13\n00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.800\nthis may be a little scary for\nsome of you who are not used to it.\n\n14\n00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.420\nThat's okay, that's okay, because\neventually you'll find that often times\n\n15\n00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.400\nit's the best way to do things or\nmaybe the only way do things.\n\n16\n00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.750\n&gt;&gt; And you gotta start somewhere, right?\n\n17\n00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.080\n&gt;&gt; You gotta start somewhere.\n\n18\n00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.110\nAnd so those of you who haven't been\nin a command line, just hold on.\n\n19\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.300\nWe've got a great tutorial for\nyou to go through on your own time and\n\n20\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.560\nI encourage all students to go\nthrough it it's really good.\n\n21\n00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.700\nSo first of all let's talk about the pros\nand you know what always comes with pros?\n\n22\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Unfortunately I feel like\nit's going to be something negative.\n\n23\n00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.930\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cons.\n\n24\n00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.710\nSo if we can bring up the slide here.\n\n25\n00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.440\nThis is a rendition of\nthe pros versus the cons.\n\n26\n00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.920\nNow the first one, a pro,\nis that it provides the user more control.\n\n27\n00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.740\nAnd I mentioned earlier that there are\nthings that you can't do in the GUI and\n\n28\n00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.460\nyou need to resort to the command line.\n\n29\n00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.820\nThis is the more control piece.\n\n30\n00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.600\nIt's the only option for\nsome tasks in Ubuntu, in Linux in general.\n\n31\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.080\n&gt;&gt; Saves clicking time because\nit just requires a keyboard.\n\n32\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.720\nWell-\n&gt;&gt; Initially that could be conserve a con,\n\n33\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.330\nyeah but once you learned it,\n\n34\n00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.460\nit's definitely a pro once you\nare familiar with the environment.\n\n35\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.070\n&gt;&gt; It is but its a bit of handicap for\n\n36\n00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.660\nthose who have operated in a Windows\nenvironment who are used to\n\n37\n00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.600\nWindows not being case sensitive,\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n38\n00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.435\nUbuntu Linux is case sensitive so\nthat's gonna confuse you sometimes and\n\n39\n00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:05.650\nyour gonna do things and\nit's not gonna be typed exactly,\n\n40\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.550\nmaybe you put a lowercase c when it should\nbeen an uppercase c this sort of stuff so.\n\n41\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.047\n&gt;&gt; Yeah just the slight\nminutiaes with the syntax and\n\n42\n00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:16.912\nthings like putting your forward slashes\nand back slashes things like that,\n\n43\n00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:20.310\nthat you'll get used to\n&gt;&gt; So, I really never mind clicking but\n\n44\n00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.160\nthat's okay, you're not gonna have to\nclick anymore during the command lines,\n\n45\n00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.810\nas a matter of fact you can't click\nbecause it doesn't accept those sorts of\n\n46\n00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.660\n&gt;&gt; Functions there.\n\n47\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.480\n&gt;&gt; Functions, right?\n\n48\n00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.090\nOkay, you're in a non-graphical\nuser interface.\n\n49\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.070\nAnd incidentally,\n\n50\n00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.880\nthe fact that you're in a non-graphic\nuser interface means that there are less,\n\n51\n00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.120\nthere's a less of a load on the process\nthere, on the computer in general.\n\n52\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.780\nAnd so it doesn't take as many system\nresources to operate in the command line.\n\n53\n00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.070\nSo that's viewed as a benefit.\n\n54\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.440\nAnd then they tell us here,\nthat it can be made easier with scripting.\n\n55\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.180\nAnd the reason why it can be made,\nif you're doing multiple tasks and\n\n56\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.815\nit's repetitive, if you're writing\nI don't like to go to school.\n\n57\n00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:03.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully you're not writing that.\n\n58\n00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.630\nIt would be much easier if you could have,\nif you could do that multiple times,\n\n59\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.610\nlike have a device\n&gt;&gt; An automated system.\n\n60\n00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.720\n&gt;&gt; On a chalkboard, you guys probably\ndon't know what chalkboards are,\n\n61\n00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.490\nbut, eight pieces of chalk, and I'm\nwriting I don't want to go to school, or\n\n62\n00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.140\nwhatever I want to write, okay.\n\n63\n00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.720\nSo it's scripting, it's just a batch file.\n\n64\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.860\nIt does multiple things,\nyou type it once and it goes through and\n\n65\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.540\ndoes a whole series of things,\nthat would be an example of a script.\n\n66\n00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.188\nCons, it's no so user friendly, okay,\nbut eventually you'll get used to it.\n\n67\n00:03:35.188 --> 00:03:39.730\nAnd eventually, eventually you'll\nprobably be doing a lot more\n\n68\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.210\nin the command line and\nyou are in the gooey interface.\n\n69\n00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.050\nSimply because its easier\nonce you got the commands and\n\n70\n00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.260\nto really go this direction, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.560\nSo let's, go on to the, let me see.\n\n72\n00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.440\nWhat are we doing next?\n\n73\n00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.530\n&gt;&gt; Accessing terminal.\n\n74\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.620\n&gt;&gt; Accessing the terminal.\n\n75\n00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.470\nOkay, so let me show you-\n&gt;&gt; It's not too hard here, yeah.\n\n76\n00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.210\n&gt;&gt; On my machine, how you get there.\n\n77\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.290\nAnd again, I have to log in because\nfortunately, this is a secure environment.\n\n78\n00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.007\nAnd if I walk away from it,\nfrom my keyboard,\n\n79\n00:04:14.007 --> 00:04:18.080\nfrom my laptop, it times out and\nrequires me to log in.\n\n80\n00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.880\nWe can also set that time.\n\n81\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.380\nThe amount of time,\njust as we can in Windows.\n\n82\n00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.100\nBut this is the default setting in\na Ubuntu setting environment which means\n\n83\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.150\nits more secure.\n\n84\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.860\nIf you install Windows,\nit doesn't have that as a default setting.\n\n85\n00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.510\nShould it?\n\n86\n00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.980\nProbably.\n\n87\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.985\n&gt;&gt; Most companies even\nrequire you having that.\n\n88\n00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:36.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n89\n00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.450\nwhat we need to remember is way back\nwhen we ran a Windows 95 environment\n\n90\n00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.240\nthe security was,\neverybody gets access to everything, and\n\n91\n00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.995\nthat has changed over time for\nobvious reasons, so\n\n92\n00:04:48.995 --> 00:04:55.030\nI'm going to type my password\n[BLANK AUDIO] And as you recall,\n\n93\n00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.280\nwe had this window open,\nnow up here in the upper left hand corner,\n\n94\n00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.650\nand this is a little\ndifferent than Windows.\n\n95\n00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.010\nWindows when you want to close something,\nwell the people\n\n96\n00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.810\nthat developed this GUI they said do\nwe want to follow Windows exactly?\n\n97\n00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.950\nProbably not, right?\n\n98\n00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.510\nSo notice when I'm clicking here this\nred thing and that got rid of it.\n\n99\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.210\nAnd now that as I'm gonna click here,\nI have another red thing.\n\n100\n00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.638\nSo I have the command\n&gt;&gt; Same orientation like Mac [CROSSTALK]\n\n101\n00:05:23.638 --> 00:05:26.195\nlike you had mentioned you,\nif you're familiar with Mac,\n\n102\n00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:28.716\nyou might be a little less of\na learning curve for you here.\n\n103\n00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:29.942\nIs that [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; If you're a Windows person,\n\n104\n00:05:29.942 --> 00:05:31.150\nyou're looking on the wrong corner.\n\n105\n00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n106\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm gonna close\nthe command line down, just so\n\n107\n00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.670\nI can show you the easiest\nway to get to it.\n\n108\n00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.400\n&gt;&gt; Now we have a menu\nover here on the side.\n\n109\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.032\nThis is very similar to what you\nwould have in a Mac environment,\n\n110\n00:05:44.032 --> 00:05:46.765\nthat typically although you can move it.\n\n111\n00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:48.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n112\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.590\nit's what do they call\nthat in Mac environment?\n\n113\n00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.880\n&gt;&gt; Your dock.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah your dock.\n\n114\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.740\nThis is kind of a dock here and\nin a Windows environment it's the.\n\n115\n00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.290\n&gt;&gt; Task bar.\n&gt;&gt; Task bar, right?\n\n116\n00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.320\nSo we're all different machines.\n\n117\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.930\nSo, let me just go briefly through it so\n\n118\n00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.080\nthat you're familiar with this environment\nand then I'll show you how to bring it up.\n\n119\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.240\nBasically what we have here is, this is,\nand we're gonna come back to this.\n\n120\n00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.430\nThis is where if I don't see it,\nI can type in what I need.\n\n121\n00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.420\nAnd in this case you can see terminals\nup there and it brings it up.\n\n122\n00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.040\nSo this is kind of a search for\napplication menu,\n\n123\n00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.210\nthis was our folders and files,\nwe already saw that up there.\n\n124\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.120\nThis is Firefox, a web browser,\nit's installed by default.\n\n125\n00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.610\nAnd that's a good thing, because it's\na well known browser but notice what isn't\n\n126\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.690\nhere in terms of a browser and that's\nGoogle Chrome and I'm a junkie on Chrome.\n\n127\n00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.890\nI like Google stuff, and\nit makes my life simple.\n\n128\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.930\nTry to install Chrome on this.\n\n129\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.380\nYou could do it, but\nit's gonna be a heck of a challenge.\n\n130\n00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.350\nThat's your homework.\n\n131\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.338\nGood luck.\n\n132\n00:06:52.338 --> 00:06:54.122\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n133\n00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:57.070\nremember, this is a different\noperating system.\n\n134\n00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.340\nWe can't put Microsoft Office on it.\n\n135\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.030\nWe can't do that,\nmuch as we would like to.\n\n136\n00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.900\nWe can't, so guess what you get?\n\n137\n00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.370\nYou get LibreOffice.\n\n138\n00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.000\n&gt;&gt; Alternatives.\n\n139\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.900\n&gt;&gt; And their alternatives are here\non the dock or taskbar, or\n\n140\n00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.510\nwhatever we want to call it.\n\n141\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.200\nAnd this would be the equivalent\nof Microsoft Word.\n\n142\n00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.640\nThis would be the equivalent\nof Microsoft Office.\n\n143\n00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.400\nThis would be the equivalent\nof Microsoft PowerPoint.\n\n144\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.570\nWe've already been here,\nthis was the Ubuntu store.\n\n145\n00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.990\nWe went in briefly in the last video.\n\n146\n00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.180\nThis is Amazon.\n\n147\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:35.100\nI guess Amazon paid so that they got\nthe people that put Ubuntu together,\n\n148\n00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.210\nallowed this to be on default.\n\n149\n00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.290\nAnd we see that sometimes.\n\n150\n00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.910\n&gt;&gt; Those buisness relationships.\n\n151\n00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those relationships.\n\n152\n00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.630\nThis is your system settings.\n\n153\n00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.760\nI put this DOSBox on there.\n\n154\n00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.470\n&gt;&gt; That we have installed.\n\n155\n00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.150\n&gt;&gt; This is the trash,\nthis is like the Recycle Bin,\n\n156\n00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.590\nsame function\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n157\n00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.190\n&gt;&gt; For Windows.\n\n158\n00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.750\nSo, we're gonna go in here and I would\ntype in terminal, clicking up here,\n\n159\n00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.700\ntype in terminal and\nI bring up the terminal.\n\n160\n00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.260\nAnd here it is, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.950\nSo we can do a variety of\nthings here relative to it.\n\n162\n00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.460\nI showed you a couple of them.\n\n163\n00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.180\nThe LS for directory, or\nwe could use a DIR, or we can use LL.\n\n164\n00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.505\nThis gives us a sense as to\nwhat's in that particular folder,\n\n165\n00:08:16.505 --> 00:08:20.190\nthus the professor folder, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.970\nAnd you can see there's\na bunch of stuff up here.\n\n167\n00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.350\nWe're gonna be talking about\nwhat this particular view means.\n\n168\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:34.810\nThis is are all permissions over here,\nthis is the, and you can see, professor,\n\n169\n00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:40.070\nso this would be the owner of the file,\nwho has a right to use it.\n\n170\n00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.560\nThat kind of stuff, all kinds of-\n&gt;&gt; Details there.\n\n171\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.950\n&gt;&gt; Details when it was created\nwhether it's a folder or file.\n\n172\n00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.690\nMake sense?\n\n173\n00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.390\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n174\n00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.560\nAll right.\n\n175\n00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.450\nSo, just looking at this,\nthis is really good to see it in action.\n\n176\n00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.650\nBut you guys do have some\nalternative training materials.\n\n177\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.880\nAnd if we take a look at my screen.\n\n178\n00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.320\nI'll go ahead and show you.\n\n179\n00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.270\nIn your PowerPoint presentation,\nyou should have some links there for\n\n180\n00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.880\nsome terminal help.\n\n181\n00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.220\nAnd then, Steve, you also included\nanother slide here for this link.\n\n182\n00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:14.680\nThis was NDG Free Linux Course available\nfor the students to go ahead and use.\n\n183\n00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.510\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n184\n00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.170\n&gt;&gt; And\nI'm gonna bring that up on my browser.\n\n185\n00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.990\nSo if we can go over to my machine.\n\n186\n00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:27.060\nThis is the site and\nthis is really cool, this is amazing.\n\n187\n00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:32.840\nNDG incidentally, what they produce at my\nlevel, at the community college level,\n\n188\n00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.750\nwe use something called net lab plus and\nit's a virtual environment for\n\n189\n00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.830\nmy students to learn in any\ninternet accessible location.\n\n190\n00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.290\nThat is what NDG,\nnet development group does.\n\n191\n00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.240\nGreat company, great people,\ngreat support.\n\n192\n00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.320\nAll the good things that you would want.\n\n193\n00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.310\nThey work with\nthe Linux Professional Institute, the LPI,\n\n194\n00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:00.780\nto develop a introduction to Linux\nprogram for you to go through.\n\n195\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:08.205\nAnd I'm gonna type in my name And\nthen my e-mail address.\n\n196\n00:10:14.765 --> 00:10:17.080\nSo hopefully I typed everything right.\n\n197\n00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.440\nI agree.\n\n198\n00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.056\nAnd then I click Next Step.\n\n199\n00:10:21.837 --> 00:10:22.610\nOops.\n\n200\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:24.660\n&gt;&gt; Token missing.\n\n201\n00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.470\n&gt;&gt; Let me try it again.\n\n202\n00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.520\nI'll use a different\n&gt;&gt; Account.\n\n203\n00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.050\n&gt;&gt; account.\n\n204\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.550\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n205\n00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.270\nSo the students can go ahead and\nsign up for this.\n\n206\n00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.300\nIt's a free resource that they\nhave available to them, and\n\n207\n00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.540\nwe'll go ahead and get access to a log.\n\n208\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.330\nExcuse me, a lab,\nthat's what we're doing right here?\n\n209\n00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.170\nYep.\n\n210\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.970\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay so let me scroll back up.\n\n211\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.590\nSo you can see the launch\ncourse which is kind of.\n\n212\n00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:58.810\nSo, we just launched the course and\n\n213\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:04.310\nthis is the course,\non the left we have text and\n\n214\n00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.590\non the right,\nwe have a distribution of the Linux.\n\n215\n00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:13.850\nNow, this is not Ubuntu,\nokay this is a different distribution.\n\n216\n00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.460\nAnd they tell us to enter a key\nto start and I enter a key.\n\n217\n00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.470\nNow, it's kinda hard on\nthe screen there but basically,\n\n218\n00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.830\nlet me go over to this side and\nexplain a couple of things.\n\n219\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:28.780\nThey have a whole series of 20 modules or\nwhatever they wanna call them.\n\n220\n00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.170\n&gt;&gt; Lab exercises maybe?\n\n221\n00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's combination because what\nyou're gonna be doing is reading on\n\n222\n00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.200\nthe left and then actually doing\nthe exercises on the right.\n\n223\n00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.650\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\n\n224\n00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:43.600\nthis is a stripped down version of some\ndistribution of Linux I think it's Debian\n\n225\n00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.610\nbut I may not be totally correct on that.\n\n226\n00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:51.700\nFirst command you should sorta kinda learn\n\n227\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.140\nis perhaps clear because you've got\na lot of stuff on this screen, right?\n\n228\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.560\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I hit CLS all the time in our\nWindows command line environment.\n\n229\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in Windows line, but\n\n230\n00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.600\nCLS does not work in here because\nthat would be too Windowish.\n\n231\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.520\nEventually it probably will.\n\n232\n00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.269\n&gt;&gt; We have to be different, yeah.\n\n233\n00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.400\nSo I type clear and guess what,\nit puts everything up at the top and\n\n234\n00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.350\ngets rid of all that\nstuff that was up there.\n\n235\n00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.350\nAnd down the road we're going to be\n\n236\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:24.230\nplaying around with a program called\nG Edit, and so if I go G Edit.\n\n237\n00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.680\nI'm just showing you\nthe difference between, and\n\n238\n00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:34.210\na real key feature up here that I can\ndo here its weird but as I zoomed\n\n239\n00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:40.490\nout I'm making its smaller kinda and\nwhat browser are you using.\n\n240\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.410\nI'm using Chrome here.\n\n241\n00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.610\nYou can see that the GUI side is large\n\n242\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.510\nI mean the command line is getting\nlarger and the other side is smaller.\n\n243\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.241\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nBut\n\n244\n00:12:50.241 --> 00:12:53.510\nat least we can go up about\nthat level I think that's a.\n\n245\n00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.410\nThirty three in a third and\nthat's about as big as it will get.\n\n246\n00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.170\nBut at least you can see\nit better on the screen.\n\n247\n00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:08.810\nSo what I'm going to do is use geddit and\ncreate a text1.txt.\n\n248\n00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:14.500\nThis is my attempt to use an editor\nthat we're going to be using in Ubuntu.\n\n249\n00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.250\nAnd if click Enter, it says, god,\n\n250\n00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:23.260\nthis distribution basically\ndoes not have gedit, okay.\n\n251\n00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.520\nSo this is to show you that one command,\nthat we'll be using down the road\n\n252\n00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.610\nwhen we get to Ubuntu,\nwon't work in this distribution.\n\n253\n00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.410\nIf I do P-I-C-O,\nwhich is another editor and\n\n254\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:39.330\nthen do the same command, 1.txt.\n\n255\n00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:40.150\nI'll do txt.\n\n256\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.760\nYou can see that I now have an editor up,\nI can now is the.\n\n257\n00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.560\n&gt;&gt; Now these simple text files,\nare they viewable from the different\n\n258\n00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.110\ndistributions if they're generated\nin different text editors?\n\n259\n00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes they are, but\n\n260\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.750\nit is creating it that is\n&gt;&gt; The problem.\n\n261\n00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.730\n&gt;&gt; Since I don't have gedit,\nin this distribution I can't use it.\n\n262\n00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.310\nSo if I want to save it,\nwe look down here and\n\n263\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.780\nthey give us the little\ncommands down here.\n\n264\n00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:13.990\nAnd this is CTRL + O,\nand so it just saved it.\n\n265\n00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.050\nAnd, what I can do is, I can exit.\n\n266\n00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.670\nAnd it's CTRL + X for exit.\n\n267\n00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.430\nAnd if we do a DIR, hopefully it's there.\n\n268\n00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.700\nAnd it is,\nyou can see it over there to the right.\n\n269\n00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.130\nSo that file is there.\n\n270\n00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.480\nSo the reason I gave you this example is,\nthis is showing\n\n271\n00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.354\nthat not every distribution is the same\n&gt;&gt; Has the same components.\n\n272\n00:14:35.354 --> 00:14:38.290\n&gt;&gt; Some comes with some stuff,\nsome comes without it.\n\n273\n00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:38.900\nMake sense?\n\n274\n00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, going back here so\n\n275\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:47.430\nI can show you just basically on the left\nside a little bit more of what's going on.\n\n276\n00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.410\nLet me expand.\n\n277\n00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:50.810\nOops, am I doing it the right?\n\n278\n00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:52.690\nYeah, 75 I'm getting up there.\n\n279\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.630\nOkay, so.\n[LAUGH]\n\n280\n00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.650\nNow we're getting up to a size where\nyou can see, the right gets smaller.\n\n281\n00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.580\nSo this is where you go for\nmodule to module.\n\n282\n00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.170\nThis is very helpful.\n\n283\n00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:08.350\nIt might scare you that it says 20 but\nI think you can get through it in an hour\n\n284\n00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:14.900\nand a half and it a builds a real solid\nfoundation relative to the command line.\n\n285\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:20.280\nIt's free, you have to enter your name and\nan email address, you might\n\n286\n00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.600\nwant to put the different name if you just\ndon't want them to have your real name,\n\n287\n00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.670\nalthough they like to have that because\nthey like to reach out and contact you.\n\n288\n00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And tell you about-\n\n289\n00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.830\n&gt;&gt; So we'll be learning things like how to\n\n290\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:33.950\ncreate users with the command line instead\nof just relying what I'm going to do so\n\n291\n00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.500\nand things like adding program via the\ncommand line interface, or via terminal.\n\n292\n00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.380\nI should use the proper\nLinux terminology here.\n\n293\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.630\nSo, we might get familiar\nwith how to go ahead and\n\n294\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.310\ndo those particular components, right?\n\n295\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.640\nOr this functions.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n296\n00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.160\nSo if we go back in and\nlet me type my password, see,\n\n297\n00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.670\nit's a rather short fused on here.\n\n298\n00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:53.810\nBut that's okay, really.\n\n299\n00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.860\nWe left the machine,\nwe we're doing other things.\n\n300\n00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n301\n00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:03.560\n&gt;&gt; And so\nhere we are at this command line.\n\n302\n00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.760\nAnd let me just show you,\nI do a clear again.\n\n303\n00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.740\nOops, gotta click in to it.\n\n304\n00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:14.749\nSo that we didn't get\nto the top of here and\n\n305\n00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:22.327\nif I we're for\nexample to type in gedit, tst.txt.\n\n306\n00:16:24.641 --> 00:16:25.337\nVoila.\n\n307\n00:16:25.337 --> 00:16:26.120\n&gt;&gt; There you go, now you can use it.\n\n308\n00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:31.640\n&gt;&gt; And not only am I in this application,\n\n309\n00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.870\nremember when we were trying\nto do was inside the terminal.\n\n310\n00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:41.220\nIt popped inside the terminal this\ndidn't this is actually launches upper\n\n311\n00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:46.690\napplications so this is where I can go and\nI could type and do all kinds of thing.\n\n312\n00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:47.660\nPretty cool right.\n\n313\n00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.880\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty cool.\n\n314\n00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.000\nIt's always cool learning new things.\n\n315\n00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.780\nWe'll bow out of here.\n\n316\n00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:00.000\nSo, I guess probably the best thing is,\ncan we go back to the slides?\n\n317\n00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.580\nAre we done?\n\n318\n00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we can go back to the slides.\n\n319\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.980\nLet's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n320\n00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.220\nI kind of skipped ahead,\nto look at some of the syntax here.\n\n321\n00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.560\nJust to see what we had going on.\n\n322\n00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's where we were.\n\n323\n00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.920\nWe have some sample\ncommands available to us.\n\n324\n00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay so\nlet's look at this one up on the top here.\n\n325\n00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.085\nAnd you can see that its CAT dashed n and\n\n326\n00:17:18.085 --> 00:17:21.760\nincidentally the purpose of the dashed\nn put a number on the line, So\n\n327\n00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:27.080\nI'm basically gonna create a text, a\ndocument something same the sort of thing\n\n328\n00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.910\nyou create a notepad if you're running\nin a windows environment but I'm using.\n\n329\n00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:33.900\nThe command line to do it.\n\n330\n00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.260\nSo it's cat.\n\n331\n00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.290\n&gt;&gt; You're going to show\nus some examples here?\n\n332\n00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.480\nWhy don't we just wrap up for\nthis particular episode so\n\n333\n00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.820\nyou have plenty of time.\n\n334\n00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.910\nThis is good stuff right here and\nI appreciate that.\n\n335\n00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.980\nSo let's just sign off for\nthis particular episode.\n\n336\n00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.590\nBut don't go anywhere because\nSteve is going to go ahead and\n\n337\n00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.730\nactually execute this and\nshow us how we would do these commands.\n\n338\n00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.340\nSo we're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n339\n00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.390\nI'm your host I am Cherokee Boose.\n\n340\n00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.960\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n341\n00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.426\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here for cyberpatriot\n\n342\n00:18:03.426 --> 00:18:09.441\n[MUSIC]\n\n343\n00:18:09.441 --> 00:18:12.210\nThank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.641\n&gt;&gt; Welcome Cyber Patriots.\n\n5\n00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:15.749\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.540\nAnd this is actually a part two for\nour Ubuntu commands.\n\n7\n00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.200\nAnd with us today we have\nProfessor Steve Lynthicum.\n\n8\n00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.100\nThank you for joining us today, Steve.\n\n9\n00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.060\n&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.\n\n10\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.860\nWhat we're gonna be looking\nat is the command line.\n\n11\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.394\nThis is the terminal in Unix parlance.\n\n12\n00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:35.300\nI guess I should call it a terminal as\nopposes to the command box or the DOS box.\n\n13\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.210\nThey probably wouldn't appreciate that,\nthe Linux people out there.\n\n14\n00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.913\nSo what we wanna do is we wanna enter\na command, and it's on the slide.\n\n15\n00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:46.330\nSo, why don't you bring up the slide.\n\n16\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.240\n&gt;&gt; Sure\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you can see it up there.\n\n17\n00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.298\nIt is cat.\n\n18\n00:00:52.298 --> 00:00:55.110\nC, A, T.\nAnd then it has a dash n, and\n\n19\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.150\nthen it has a space,\nwhich is kinda hard to see there.\n\n20\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.160\nAnd then we have a greater than sign.\n\n21\n00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.190\nAnd then we have a directory where\nwe're gonna be putting this.\n\n22\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.560\nNow, I'm not actually gonna be\nputting in that directory information.\n\n23\n00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.640\nAnd I find it much easier to not do that.\n\n24\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.030\nI find it better off right\naway to go to that directory.\n\n25\n00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.330\nThat way, I don't have this big long-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n26\n00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.850\nyou're already working in the right spot.\n\n27\n00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the right spot.\n\n28\n00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.890\nIt's my own personal way of doing things.\n\n29\n00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.100\nIf you wanna do it this way,\nand you wanna type things.\n\n30\n00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.060\nMy problem is I'm a pretty good typist,\n\n31\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.415\nbut even the smallest error in\na command can be problematic.\n\n32\n00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:28.080\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n33\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.510\n&gt;&gt; So let's go to my machine here.\n\n34\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.670\nAnd what I've done is hopefully you can\nsee this a little better than that smaller\n\n35\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.180\nversion that we had before.\n\n36\n00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.030\nYou can see where I am, and\nI'm actually in my documents.\n\n37\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.270\nMeaning my user, professor,\nin the Documents folder\n\n38\n00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.240\nthat we saw earlier when we were\nlooking at the folder structure.\n\n39\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.090\nSo what I'm gonna do is type that command,\ncat, and I do a space dash n.\n\n40\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.930\nAnd what that's gonna do is\nit's gonna create a number,\n\n41\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.410\na line number, as I go through and\ndo more and more lines.\n\n42\n00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.810\nAnd then I'm gonna do a space and\na greater than sign.\n\n43\n00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.740\nAnd then I'm gonna do a space, and\nI'm gonna type in the file name.\n\n44\n00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.146\nNow, in this case,\nI'll just do a F, I, L, E name.txt.\n\n45\n00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:14.290\nNotice, I'm using that text extension.\n\n46\n00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.240\nAnd the rationale for\nthat is, I'm telling UBUNTU,\n\n47\n00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.394\nthe installation, what sort of program\nit should use to open this file.\n\n48\n00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.563\nAnd it's G EDIT.\n\n49\n00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:28.820\nGEdit.\nGEdit is tied to text files\n\n50\n00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.670\nbasically, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.860\nSo, I do an Enter here.\n\n52\n00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.580\nAnd now I just have a blinking\ncursor there, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.050\nSo, what we go through and\nwe do is we type in some information.\n\n54\n00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.445\nSo now is the time for all good, and\n\n55\n00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:49.360\nthis would be good men and\n\n56\n00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.830\nall that other stuff, but\nwe'll just go like that, okay?\n\n57\n00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.790\nAnd so, basically what I've done\nis I've completed the document.\n\n58\n00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.990\nNow let's go back to the slide real quick,\n\n59\n00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.970\nbecause it helps us explain\nwhat we need to do next.\n\n60\n00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.860\nAnd basically, what we do here,\n\n61\n00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.670\nis you can see that it tells us to do\nan Enter down there at the bottom.\n\n62\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.010\nThis step four and step five.\n\n63\n00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.298\nSo we're gonna Enter and\nthen we're gonna do a control-D.\n\n64\n00:03:13.298 --> 00:03:15.790\nAnd the control-D\nbasically releases us from,\n\n65\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.640\nsaves this document and\ngets us out of here.\n\n66\n00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.050\nSo going back to my screen,\nwe're gonna do the Enter.\n\n67\n00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.760\nAnd then we're gonna do a Ctrl+D, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.040\nAnd that puts us back where we were.\n\n69\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.320\nWe're outside of this document that\nwe created, created and saved.\n\n70\n00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.990\nAnd so, if we do a dir,\nyou can see that the file.txt is there.\n\n71\n00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.890\nNow, if I go into my\nfile cabinet area here,\n\n72\n00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.870\nnow this is kind of a simple way to do it-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n73\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.450\nwe're just accessing it\nthrough the GUI now?\n\n74\n00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.470\n&gt;&gt; Through the GUI.\n&gt;&gt; As opposed to the actual terminal.\n\n75\n00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.870\n&gt;&gt; And the reason I'm doing this is I\nwanted to show you that the importance\n\n76\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.990\nof that .txt is that through the GUI,\n\n77\n00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.030\nif we go into documents here,\nyou can see that it's here.\n\n78\n00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.595\nAnd if I can click on it, it opens it up.\n\n79\n00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:11.679\n[CROSSTALK] I could have also typed\nin the command line gedit and\n\n80\n00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:14.838\nit would have opened it, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:19.384\nBut I didn't do that, I just wanted\nto show you you can do some things in\n\n82\n00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:23.874\nthe command line, some in the GUI,\nand some things in either areas.\n\n83\n00:04:23.874 --> 00:04:27.166\nSo this was going from\ncommand line to GUI,\n\n84\n00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:30.970\ntrying to show you how\nthings effectively work.\n\n85\n00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.030\n&gt;&gt; Giving you some options.\n\n86\n00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes, basically some options.\n\n87\n00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well let's go ahead and\n\n88\n00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.840\ntake a look at my slide real quick\nbecause there's an interesting term here.\n\n89\n00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.800\nYou guys might have heard us say this,\nbut when we use the term syntax and\n\n90\n00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.600\nSteve noted that it's very important to\npay attention to your capitalization,\n\n91\n00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.340\nthose spaces, because that is your syntax.\n\n92\n00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.030\nThat's how we need to go ahead and\ntype it in properly.\n\n93\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.840\nSo that's what they're referencing here.\n\n94\n00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.340\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nthey're referencing English grammar,\n\n95\n00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.910\nand I'm sure some of you are going, no.\n\n96\n00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.560\nI tried to get away from that stuff,\nbut basically what we have here,\n\n97\n00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.470\nas you can see in the bottom of this\nslide, is they give us an example.\n\n98\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.630\nThe boy pet the dog.\n\n99\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.460\nNow, we know that the subject here,\ngetting back to English, is the boy.\n\n100\n00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.130\nAnd what action did that boy take?\n\n101\n00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.910\nIn this case, the boy pet.\n\n102\n00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.430\nNow, pet could be a noun,\nit could be a verb,\n\n103\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.220\nit can probably be a bunch of things.\n\n104\n00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.140\nBut in this case, it's a verb meaning\nit's an action sort of step that we take.\n\n105\n00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.260\nAnd what is the boy petting?\n\n106\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.960\nThe dog.\n\n107\n00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.600\nSo the dog is the object.\n\n108\n00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.150\nAnd the same sort of rules, or the same\nsort of syntax applies when we’re talking\n\n109\n00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.100\nabout doing commands in Linux, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.620\nSo let's go on to the next slide.\n\n111\n00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.830\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n112\n00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.770\n&gt;&gt; So here we go.\n\n113\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.660\nAnd you can see this is\nthe command that I did.\n\n114\n00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.170\nSo we've got basically the command, and\n\n115\n00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.020\nthen we've got an option, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.209\nSo in this case, the option dash n.\n\n117\n00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:05.800\nIf you noticed when we opened that file\nthere was a 1 in front of what I typed.\n\n118\n00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.680\nAnd if there had been a second line,\nthere would have been a 2 there.\n\n119\n00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.990\nSo that is an option.\n\n120\n00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.690\nThere are a whole host of options for\ndifferent sorts of commands,\n\n121\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.220\ndepending upon what you wanna do.\n\n122\n00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.090\nSo it effectively\n\n123\n00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.440\nmodifies the command to add some\nother component associated with it.\n\n124\n00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:32.580\nAnd then, if you look down, the option is\nbasically where we're gonna output it.\n\n125\n00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.200\nAnd we're putting it in a folder or file.\n\n126\n00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.740\nDoes that make kinda sense?\n\n127\n00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for our operator there?\n\n128\n00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, for the, basically,\nyeah, for the operator.\n\n129\n00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.980\nExcuse me.\nFor the operator.\n\n130\n00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.888\nSo the option customizes, and\nthen we have an operator.\n\n131\n00:06:49.888 --> 00:06:53.090\nIt says, well,\nwhere do we wanna put this thing, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.229\n&gt;&gt; And then,\nthat last portion there is the location.\n\n133\n00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:57.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the location, right?\n\n134\n00:06:57.335 --> 00:07:00.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that in a sense,\n\n135\n00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.730\nwe were talking about English here.\n\n136\n00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.280\nSo let's go on to the next slide.\n\n137\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.590\nWe can work through these guys.\n\n138\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.600\nThe next one is a sudo command for\nadding a user, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.120\nSo, and I say sudo because, guess what?\n\n140\n00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.330\nAs you're gonna see here,\nlet me clear this.\n\n141\n00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.913\nIf I try to do add user here.\n\n142\n00:07:20.913 --> 00:07:23.778\nA, D, D, U, S, E, R.\n\n143\n00:07:23.778 --> 00:07:27.077\nAnd we do C, H, E, R, O, K, E, E.\n\n144\n00:07:27.077 --> 00:07:30.430\nAdd user Cherokee.\n\n145\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.200\nWell, guess what?\n\n146\n00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.970\n&gt;&gt; We don't have those permissions, do we?\n\n147\n00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.640\n&gt;&gt; We do not have those permissions.\n\n148\n00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.396\nAnd so, in order to elevate us to that,\n\n149\n00:07:39.396 --> 00:07:43.200\non a single time basis, I would type this-\n&gt;&gt; So I would have\n\n150\n00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.430\nto log out of this particular account,\nand log in as like the root account.\n\n151\n00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.406\nI could just simply\ntemporarily elevate myself?\n\n152\n00:07:50.406 --> 00:07:53.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes, oftentimes in a Windows\nenvironment, if you're going to\n\n153\n00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.170\nbe doing something, and you're an ordinary\nuser, because that's what you want to be.\n\n154\n00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.380\nRemember I suggested that you\ncreate another user account.\n\n155\n00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.420\nAnd you want to do something that\nyou need those elevated privileges,\n\n156\n00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.280\nthose administrative privileges for.\n\n157\n00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.340\nYou will go to the icon that you\nwant to do your right-click on, and\n\n158\n00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.490\nit will say run as administrator.\n\n159\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.000\n&gt;&gt; When you go to launch commune prompt.\n\n160\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.340\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n161\n00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.800\nSo we're doing basically\nthe same thing here.\n\n162\n00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.730\nI'm doing sudo, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:28.220\nAnd then I'm gonna type in add user C,\nH, E, R, O, K, E, E.\n\n164\n00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:28.890\nSo basically,\n\n165\n00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:35.090\nwhat I'm asking it to do is I wanna add\nCherokee as having an account here.\n\n166\n00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.450\nBut what I need to do,\nis I need to do it as an administrator.\n\n167\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.440\nAnd it asks me for\nthe password for professor.\n\n168\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.880\nAnd I think I mentioned this in an earlier\nvideo, I'm gonna type in my password.\n\n169\n00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.610\nBut watch, nothing happens on the screen.\n\n170\n00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.600\n&gt;&gt; And they do that for\nsecurity purposes, right?\n\n171\n00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.560\nSo we can't count--\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n172\n00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.680\n&gt;&gt; If I was shoulder surfing you, I\nwouldn't be able to count the bubbles that\n\n173\n00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.000\nyou're typing in and\nthen try to guess your password.\n\n174\n00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n175\n00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.480\nSo we go here.\n\n176\n00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:04.967\nAnd now it's going to ask\nme to enter some things.\n\n177\n00:09:04.967 --> 00:09:06.502\nP, A, S, S, W, O, R, D.\n\n178\n00:09:06.502 --> 00:09:08.037\nP, A, S, S, W, O, R, D.\n\n179\n00:09:08.037 --> 00:09:11.365\nAnd it's gonna ask me,\nI'm just gonna go by but\n\n180\n00:09:11.365 --> 00:09:13.850\nI put in-\n&gt;&gt; The parameters for my account there?\n\n181\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the room number,\nthe work number, the home phone number,\n\n182\n00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.460\nall those things, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.760\nAnd then I type in Y for yes.\n\n184\n00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.760\nAnd now, we have a Cherokee account.\n\n185\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.835\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n186\n00:09:23.835 --> 00:09:24.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n187\n00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.695\nNow, I could do that same sort of\nactivity through the GUI also.\n\n188\n00:09:28.695 --> 00:09:29.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n189\n00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n190\n00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.955\n&gt;&gt; Just a couple different ways\nto give us that flexibility.\n\n191\n00:09:32.955 --> 00:09:35.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a, and\nI would go through and\n\n192\n00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.310\nsearch in the search terminal up here\nthe fact that what do we wanna do here?\n\n193\n00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.447\nWe wanna add user, right?\n\n194\n00:09:46.716 --> 00:09:49.857\nAnd, well, let me see.\n\n195\n00:09:49.857 --> 00:09:52.050\nI gotta find that.\n\n196\n00:09:55.412 --> 00:09:56.700\nYeah, user accounts.\n\n197\n00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.270\nI did the wrong command.\n\n198\n00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:04.350\nSo this is basically the same sort\nof thing, somewhere back here,\n\n199\n00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:10.350\nprobably below this is Here it is,\nit's up here.\n\n200\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.160\nNow, same sort of thing,\nas you can see we added Cherokee here.\n\n201\n00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.510\nIn order to do anything,\nI gotta hit this unlock button up here.\n\n202\n00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.870\n&gt;&gt; Like putting that password in?\n\n203\n00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.890\n&gt;&gt; And\nI get the request to put in that password.\n\n204\n00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.277\nSo, I could go through,\nand I could do Sam.\n\n205\n00:10:27.683 --> 00:10:29.480\nAnd now I'm able to add a user.\n\n206\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.520\nI can click a plus here, and\nwe can go through the same thing.\n\n207\n00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.797\nSam, just click Add.\n\n208\n00:10:39.797 --> 00:10:41.700\nAnd we now have user Sam.\n\n209\n00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.150\nSo we can go through and do that.\n\n210\n00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.870\nIf I want to delete Sam,\nI would highlight him, and I would go-\n\n211\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:48.720\n&gt;&gt; Goodbye, Sam.\n\n212\n00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.990\n&gt;&gt; Here, I get a choice of,\ndo we wanna keep Sam files?\n\n213\n00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.380\nDo we get rid of Sam's files?\n\n214\n00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.520\nWe can do all this on the command\nline incidentally, also.\n\n215\n00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.240\n&gt;&gt; And companies usually recommend to\ngo ahead and keep for a period of time.\n\n216\n00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.468\nJust like in Windows and Active Directory,\nwe're not deleting those accounts.\n\n217\n00:11:03.468 --> 00:11:06.370\nWe're just disabling them until we're sure\n\n218\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.570\nthat we have access to all\nthe resources we need.\n\n219\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.053\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so, we're not getting rid of those.\n\n220\n00:11:11.053 --> 00:11:14.684\n&gt;&gt; When the boss says get rid of\ntheir account, delete their account,\n\n221\n00:11:14.684 --> 00:11:17.280\nyou would go in and you would disable it.\n\n222\n00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.680\nBecause bosses have a tendency\nto change their minds.\n\n223\n00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.220\nThere may be folders and\nfiles, and incidentally,\n\n224\n00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.030\nhere I get an opportunity\nto delete their files.\n\n225\n00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.990\nI probably wouldn't do that,\neven if I were deleting the account.\n\n226\n00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.680\nBecause I ultimately want\nto have access to that.\n\n227\n00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.407\n&gt;&gt; Maybe Sam made a really good\ndocument of some prospective sales\n\n228\n00:11:35.407 --> 00:11:40.170\nopportunities, and you don't want to lose\nall that work that Sam had created, so.\n\n229\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.839\n&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna delete Sam's files.\n\n230\n00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:44.095\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz he doesn't have any files, okay?\n\n231\n00:11:44.095 --> 00:11:49.670\n[LAUGH] So that gives us the, basically\nthe concepts relative to adding a user.\n\n232\n00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.600\nWe need that elevated\npermission to do that.\n\n233\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.230\nMake sense?\n\n234\n00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n235\n00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.000\n&gt;&gt; So where are we?\n\n236\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.930\n&gt;&gt; For this particular slide we had the\nsudo command, which you introduced us to.\n\n237\n00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:04.150\nThere was a continuation there, so\nthey wanted us to add Archimedes.\n\n238\n00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.470\nBut you added Sam for us.\n\n239\n00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.610\nSo we finished that.\n\n240\n00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.570\nThere are some extra components for\nthe sudo command here.\n\n241\n00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.070\nDifferent variations.\n\n242\n00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, best way to explain\nthat one is if you do sudo,\n\n243\n00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:23.480\nsudo space su, that means that you\ncan do a whole series of commands.\n\n244\n00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.220\nYou will be asked for your password,\nbut then you can go through and\n\n245\n00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.860\nyou don't have to do your password for\nevery single thing you do after that.\n\n246\n00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.940\nAnd then, you don't want to\nbe at that elevated point.\n\n247\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:40.110\n&gt;&gt; So, sudo would be for like a one time\naction, whereas sudo su would be if I'm\n\n248\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:45.120\ndoing multiple commands that would require\nthat elevated privilege, if I can speak.\n\n249\n00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.272\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let me,\nif we can come back to my desktop so\n\n250\n00:12:47.272 --> 00:12:50.110\nI can show them the command line\nhere to give you an example.\n\n251\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.595\nFirst of all, notice that dollar\nsign at the end of document.\n\n252\n00:12:53.595 --> 00:12:54.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n253\n00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.270\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat tells us that we're in user mode.\n\n254\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.510\nWe're not in an administrative mode.\n\n255\n00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:05.950\nSo if I do a sudo su,\n\n256\n00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.465\nit's going to ask me,\nwell, it basically shifted.\n\n257\n00:13:09.465 --> 00:13:10.260\n[LAUGH].\n\n258\n00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.520\nBut normally it would ask me for\nmy password.\n\n259\n00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.630\nI'm already in this elevated position.\n\n260\n00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.950\nNotice it's a pound sign, as opposed to a-\n&gt;&gt; Dollar sign.\n\n261\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.940\n&gt;&gt; Dollar sign.\n\n262\n00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.940\nAnd that tells us, and\nnotice that it's a different color.\n\n263\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:22.850\nIt's white.\n\n264\n00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.160\nSo I have two clues as to the fact\nthat I'm in this elevated mode, and\n\n265\n00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.910\nI can go through and\ndo a bunch of commands.\n\n266\n00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.201\nIf I wanted to, on a command line,\nrun a whole series of users,\n\n267\n00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:35.130\nI won't have to every time\nbe putting in my password.\n\n268\n00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.390\nAnd the way, obviously,\n\n269\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:41.160\nyou don't wanna stay in this mode unless\nyou're doing administrative sort of tasks.\n\n270\n00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.840\nAnd so it's EXIT, and\nthat brings me back to where I was.\n\n271\n00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.190\nSo an ordinary user.\n\n272\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:54.280\nSo you don't work in administrative mode,\nin root mode, unless you're truly there.\n\n273\n00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.970\nNow, incidentally, one of the other\nthings, real quick to show relative to\n\n274\n00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:04.750\nthe structure of the files and folder\nstructure, is going back to SUDO SU.\n\n275\n00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:12.190\nIf I do a DIR here, you see I'm pretty\nclose to in the documents folder.\n\n276\n00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.640\nSo I'm gonna go backwards, CD, got that.\n\n277\n00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.000\nAnd now I'm in the professor.\n\n278\n00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.880\nAnd this is basically where I would be.\n\n279\n00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.699\nThis is as far back as I can\ngo if I'm an ordinary user.\n\n280\n00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:27.823\nBut I'm not, I'm an administrator.\n\n281\n00:14:27.823 --> 00:14:31.783\nSo, I go CD dot dot.\n\n282\n00:14:31.783 --> 00:14:35.220\nAnd I go back a level, and I go cd ..\n\n283\n00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:40.648\nAnd I'm really getting down\ninto the root of Linux that\n\n284\n00:14:40.648 --> 00:14:45.850\nC: are where all the files\nare that relate to Linux.\n\n285\n00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.020\nAnd so, if I'm going to\nmodify the Linux environment,\n\n286\n00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.400\nthe Unix environment,\nI'm gonna do it at this sort of level.\n\n287\n00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.430\nThis is a protected area\nthat only administrators,\n\n288\n00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.060\nonly root qualifying accounts, can get to.\n\n289\n00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.060\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense, and\nthat's what we really want.\n\n290\n00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.064\nWe want our systems to be\nprotected in that way.\n\n291\n00:15:04.064 --> 00:15:04.623\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n292\n00:15:04.623 --> 00:15:05.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for showing us.\n\n293\n00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.610\nI appreciate that, and\nI'm sure you guys do, too, out there.\n\n294\n00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.640\nAnd thank you guys for\njoining us throughout this series.\n\n295\n00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.080\nWe do have some more information\ncoming your way, so don't go anywhere,\n\n296\n00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.200\nget comfortable.\n\n297\n00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.560\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this particular episode.\n\n298\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.020\nAnd I'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n299\n00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.396\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n300\n00:15:22.396 --> 00:15:25.783\n&gt;&gt; See you next time\nhere at Cyber Patriot.\n\n301\n00:15:25.783 --> 00:15:31.735\n[MUSIC]\n\n302\n00:15:31.735 --> 00:15:34.906\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:15.003\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, cyber patriots,\nto another online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.430\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.724\nIn this episode, we're still\ngonna be talking about Ubuntu and\n\n7\n00:00:20.724 --> 00:00:24.720\nLinux environments, but\nwe're gonna be looking at GUI security.\n\n8\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.320\nWith us today, we have\nProfessor Steve Linthicum to go ahead and\n\n9\n00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.330\ngo through these topics.\n\n10\n00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.910\nSo thank you for joining us, Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.690\n&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.\n\n12\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.220\nWhat we're gonna do is,\nis we're gonna go through the slides and\n\n13\n00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.140\nthen I'm going to demonstrate\non my own machine here.\n\n14\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.430\nAnd so we'll briefly go through and\nsummarize what's on the slides,\n\n15\n00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.480\nthen come back and actually do\nthe demos that we're gonna do today.\n\n16\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.560\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look here.\n\n17\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so here we have,\non this first slide,\n\n18\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.430\nit basically shows you the GUI interface,\nwhich I currently have on my machine,\n\n19\n00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.890\nand then we're gonna go and with Windows,\nwe have the same called the control panel.\n\n20\n00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.730\nWell, we don't really have\na control panel in Ubuntu, but\n\n21\n00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.440\nwe do have something that is very similar.\n\n22\n00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.273\nOf course, Microsoft undoubtedly has\nthe term control panel copyrighted, so\n\n23\n00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:12.372\nthey couldn't use that, so\nthat may be a reason for\n\n24\n00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:16.286\ndiscussing this as being the system\nsetting page, basically.\n\n25\n00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:18.461\nSo let's go onto the next slide, so\n\n26\n00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:22.385\nthat we can show you some different\nthings that we're gonna do.\n\n27\n00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:25.754\nOne of the things we're gonna do, and\nwe really have already done this, so\n\n28\n00:01:25.754 --> 00:01:28.560\nit's gonna be ever so brief,\nis setting up user accounts.\n\n29\n00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.440\nYou remember we did that in the GUI.\n\n30\n00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.970\nWe also did it with the command line, so\n\n31\n00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.666\nmany of these things we can\ndo in both environments.\n\n32\n00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:41.110\nAnd then we're gonna look at\ninstalling automatic updates,\n\n33\n00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.710\nas we all know now,\nwhat's becoming more and\n\n34\n00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.740\nmore universal is this updating\nprocess is becoming automated.\n\n35\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.970\nAnd then Windows setting\nwith the Windows 10,\n\n36\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.000\nthat's pretty much what it is,\nand you're kind of stuck with it,\n\n37\n00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.270\nwhen Microsoft decides that their\noperating system needs to be patched.\n\n38\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.410\nIt gets patched.\n\n39\n00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.640\nAnd part of that stems from\nwhat we call the zero time, or\n\n40\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.400\nzero date, what's that,\nI'm trying to think of that term.\n\n41\n00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.090\n&gt;&gt; Zero day attacks.\n\n42\n00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, zero day attacks where\nthe virus hits the market,\n\n43\n00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.736\nand nobody knows about it.\n\n44\n00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:19.278\nAnd all of a sudden, we got a patch\nreal quick to solve the problem.\n\n45\n00:02:19.278 --> 00:02:21.041\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because normally we have what,\npatch Tuesday?\n\n46\n00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:25.107\nOnce a month, Microsoft will\nrelease their scheduled patches.\n\n47\n00:02:25.107 --> 00:02:29.142\nWell, what do we do on Wednesday\nif there's a zero day exploit,\n\n48\n00:02:29.142 --> 00:02:31.280\nwe were just now made aware of?\n\n49\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.620\nAre we gonna wait till next month?\n\n50\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.375\nI don't think we can really wait,\nso then they go ahead and\n\n51\n00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:36.676\nissue out those hot fixes.\n\n52\n00:02:36.676 --> 00:02:41.841\nSo, yeah, it's very, yeah, they're\ngonna go ahead and push it out to us,\n\n53\n00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:47.164\nit's not something that we have to really\ntake extra manual steps to go ahead and\n\n54\n00:02:47.164 --> 00:02:48.919\npull those updates down.\n\n55\n00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:49.719\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n56\n00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:54.130\nan interesting discussion I heard the\nother day on one of my security podcast.\n\n57\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.590\nI subscribed to a number of podcast.\n\n58\n00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.250\nIt's a discussion what Google is doing.\n\n59\n00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.150\nAnd what Google is doing is giving, for\nexample, Microsoft seven days notice\n\n60\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.410\nthat they've either got to\nsolve a Google discovered\n\n61\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.400\nissue relating to vulnerability,\nor Google is going to advertise it\n\n62\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.029\nto the world\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n63\n00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.734\n&gt;&gt; And their sticking to that pledge,\nbecause-\n\n64\n00:03:18.734 --> 00:03:19.615\n&gt;&gt; Keep them on their toes, right?\n\n65\n00:03:19.615 --> 00:03:24.482\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, originally, it was 90 days,\nand then Microsoft ignored it,\n\n66\n00:03:24.482 --> 00:03:28.410\nand other software manufacturers\nignored this sort of thing.\n\n67\n00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.000\nAnd they got mad when Google told\nthe world about it, which makes sense,\n\n68\n00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.450\nthey would be upset, but Google had given\nthem 90 days and they didn't comply.\n\n69\n00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.090\nGoogle shortened that time period\nrelative to the major software houses.\n\n70\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.432\nAnd I think that's a good idea.\n\n71\n00:03:42.432 --> 00:03:46.684\nOne of the first things that should be\nfixed, rather than what you're continuing\n\n72\n00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:50.642\nto do, is fix that vulnerability if\nit's a serious enough vulnerability.\n\n73\n00:03:50.642 --> 00:03:52.089\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you're saying,\n\n74\n00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:56.180\nfix those security flaws instead of\nadding additional features, maybe?\n\n75\n00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and focus.\n\n76\n00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.140\nFocus your efforts on making your\noperating system as secure as possible.\n\n77\n00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.328\nAnd one way you do that is to patch\nthose zero day issues right away, so.\n\n78\n00:04:07.328 --> 00:04:08.954\n&gt;&gt; The next thing.\n\n79\n00:04:08.954 --> 00:04:11.167\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna be looking at that,\nand then.\n\n80\n00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.096\nWhat else are we?\n\n81\n00:04:12.096 --> 00:04:13.779\n&gt;&gt; It's enabling the firewall.\n\n82\n00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:17.759\n&gt;&gt; Well, enabling the firewall, and I'm\nactually gonna go through and do that, or\n\n83\n00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.750\nprobably go through it and do it on the\ncommand line, although it's just as easy.\n\n84\n00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.269\nI'll show you how easy it is in the GUI.\n\n85\n00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:25.824\nOkay, and anything else?\n\n86\n00:04:25.824 --> 00:04:28.790\n&gt;&gt; The last one is using the firewall.\n\n87\n00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:29.700\n&gt;&gt; Using the firewall.\n\n88\n00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.290\nSo we have to have it up and\nrunning before we do that.\n\n89\n00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.140\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n90\n00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.090\n&gt;&gt; So, let's switch over to\nmy machine here, my desktop.\n\n91\n00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.310\nAnd it's wide awake.\n\n92\n00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.780\nIt was about to go quiet.\n\n93\n00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.630\nSo, I don't have to login.\n\n94\n00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.870\nI clicked that little gear\nthing down in the corner, and\n\n95\n00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.410\nyou can see this is the equivalent.\n\n96\n00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.380\n&gt;&gt; Equivalent to Control Panel.\n\n97\n00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.390\n&gt;&gt; To the Control Panel.\n\n98\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n99\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.170\n&gt;&gt; I guess, you could probably call it.\n\n100\n00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.780\n&gt;&gt; System Settings.\n\n101\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, System Setting.\n\n102\n00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.440\nSo, what we wanna do is the first thing\nwe're gonna be looking at is user setup,\n\n103\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.040\nsetting up users.\n\n104\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.190\nAnd probably the easiest way to figure\nthat out is to go up here where they've\n\n105\n00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.570\ngot that little magnifying glass.\n\n106\n00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.080\n&gt;&gt; The search bar.\n\n107\n00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.830\n&gt;&gt; The search bar,\nup there as you can see.\n\n108\n00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.550\nAnd if we type in U-S-E-R, wow.\n\n109\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.590\nSo we have User Accounts.\n\n110\n00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.580\nAdd and remove users.\n\n111\n00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.426\nSo, we double-click on that,\nand there it is.\n\n112\n00:05:17.426 --> 00:05:21.317\nAnd you remember, I'm sure,\nthat we actually went through and\n\n113\n00:05:21.317 --> 00:05:25.009\ndid this fairly simple process\nto add users through the GUI.\n\n114\n00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:26.903\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if not,\ngo back and rewatch that video,\n\n115\n00:05:26.903 --> 00:05:28.460\nbecause that's what these are here for.\n\n116\n00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but a quick reminder,\nand this is for\n\n117\n00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.470\nyou in your cyber patriot competition.\n\n118\n00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.370\nOne of the problems with VMware player and\nUbuntu,\n\n119\n00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.520\nthe version you're using, this is,\nas I said, a newer version.\n\n120\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.910\nAnd sometimes the screen width isn't\nas wide as you'd want it to be.\n\n121\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.840\nAnd unfortunately, this particular screen\ncan pop up, and it'll be like that, and\n\n122\n00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.010\nyou'll be scratching your\nhead trying to figure out.\n\n123\n00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.820\nWell, how do I do anything?\n\n124\n00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.800\n&gt;&gt; And modify, yeah.\n\n125\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.666\n&gt;&gt; And the problem is you can't modify-\n&gt;&gt; Pull that window over.\n\n126\n00:05:56.666 --> 00:06:00.057\n&gt;&gt; Until you go back over here and\nyou click the unlock button.\n\n127\n00:06:00.057 --> 00:06:03.120\nBecause what's that's gonna do\nis ask you for your password.\n\n128\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.500\nSo, please remember that.\n\n129\n00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.161\nOtherwise, you'll be going nuts,\nyou'll just go absolutely nuts.\n\n130\n00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:14.061\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like in Windows whenever they pop\na window up behind another window when\n\n131\n00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:15.803\nyou're configuring something.\n\n132\n00:06:15.803 --> 00:06:19.014\nAnd you're waiting and waiting, and then\nit's, yeah, it's behind the other one.\n\n133\n00:06:19.014 --> 00:06:22.356\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, we could go through and\nsimply do this, but I don't wanna,\n\n134\n00:06:22.356 --> 00:06:23.604\nyou've already seen it.\n\n135\n00:06:23.604 --> 00:06:27.866\nSo, I think we're better off in the time\nprovided that we just get through\n\n136\n00:06:27.866 --> 00:06:29.606\nthe aspects of this process.\n\n137\n00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:32.265\n&gt;&gt; And look at our automatic\nupdates instead perhaps?\n\n138\n00:06:32.265 --> 00:06:36.112\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what I'm gonna do is I\ncould close this with a red x, but\n\n139\n00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:40.602\nyou have the same techniques in Windows,\nsometimes you can go back a step,\n\n140\n00:06:40.602 --> 00:06:44.190\nand if I click here and\ngo to all settings, guess where I am?\n\n141\n00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.146\nI am back to that previous screen.\n\n142\n00:06:46.146 --> 00:06:47.270\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n143\n00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.462\non this one, we're doing,\nwhich one are we at?\n\n144\n00:06:50.462 --> 00:06:51.331\nWe're doing the updates.\n\n145\n00:06:51.331 --> 00:06:52.092\n&gt;&gt; Updates.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so,\n\n146\n00:06:52.092 --> 00:06:54.169\nwhat do you think you type in here?\n\n147\n00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:55.909\n&gt;&gt; Update, yeah.\n\n148\n00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:57.523\n&gt;&gt; Update.\n\n149\n00:06:57.523 --> 00:06:59.567\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nothing tricky there.\n\n150\n00:06:59.567 --> 00:07:00.172\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n151\n00:07:00.172 --> 00:07:04.010\nYeah, so, I'm gonna click here,\nand here we go.\n\n152\n00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.340\nThis is our area where\nwe would do updates.\n\n153\n00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.510\nAnd you've got Ubuntu software, that's\nsoftware that the Ubuntu is kicking out,\n\n154\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.460\nhow often do you want to, well, these are\nbasically your sources on the Internet.\n\n155\n00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.990\nYou've got multiple sources, and so here,\nyou're selecting which ones you want.\n\n156\n00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.260\nThis is Ubuntu software,\n\n157\n00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.380\nthese are Ubuntu locations,\nI guess it'd be the various to say.\n\n158\n00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.960\nSo, you would probably leave\nthese pretty much the same,\n\n159\n00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.430\nunless you're concerned about\nsoftware restrictions or copyrights.\n\n160\n00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:41.430\nYou don't wanna download stuff where there\nare restrictions associated with it.\n\n161\n00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.890\nSo, you could deselect that.\n\n162\n00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.250\nIf I did that, as you'll see, I get\nthis thing where I gotta authenticate.\n\n163\n00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.920\nSo, I'm obviously not gonna do that.\n\n164\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.510\nBut I did go through and do that.\n\n165\n00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.030\nOther software,\nthese are other placers where you can get\n\n166\n00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.620\nsoftware that has been\ndeveloped by Ubuntu partners.\n\n167\n00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.460\nYou could add other places\nwhere you could get software,\n\n168\n00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.050\nother locations on the Internet.\n\n169\n00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.840\nUpdates, we pretty much have seen\nthis before in a Windows environment.\n\n170\n00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.250\nThis is how often the operating system\nis out there, checking to see if\n\n171\n00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.250\nthere are any updates, and\nwhat they should do with regard to them.\n\n172\n00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.560\nSo, this is setup for daily,\nmaybe that's okay, maybe if you don't have\n\n173\n00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.640\na lot of bandwidth, or you just don't\nwant the machine out there checking.\n\n174\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.298\nI don't think it's much\nof a drain on bandwidth.\n\n175\n00:08:24.298 --> 00:08:29.316\nThis one right here, this is a,\nwhen there are security updates, so\n\n176\n00:08:29.316 --> 00:08:34.304\nyour machine has discovered that they are-\n&gt;&gt; So, this are looking pretty similar\n\n177\n00:08:34.304 --> 00:08:38.210\nto the type of options that we had to\nchose before a windows environment.\n\n178\n00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.460\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so,\nyou can download it automatically, but\n\n179\n00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.180\nnot install it or download and install\nautomatically so those are your choices.\n\n180\n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:52.858\nWhen there are other updates, display them\nweekly, or display them every two weeks.\n\n181\n00:08:52.858 --> 00:08:56.396\nI don't know what the differences is\nbetween a week and every two weeks,\n\n182\n00:08:56.396 --> 00:09:00.290\nexcept you probably only see them half as\noften if we chose them every two weeks.\n\n183\n00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.843\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n184\n00:09:00.843 --> 00:09:02.860\n&gt;&gt; That's great bit of logic there,\n\n185\n00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.120\nI think, and then notify me\nwhen there is a new version.\n\n186\n00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.910\nAnd so if you have this set, and\nthen 17 dot something came out and\n\n187\n00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.230\nwas available,\nyou would be notified of that.\n\n188\n00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, would you go ahead and\ngrab it at first?\n\n189\n00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.660\nEh, I don't know, maybe you'd let\nsomeone else grab it first and\n\n190\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.350\nwork the bugs out, then once they wrinkle\nout all the, or iron out all the wrinkles,\n\n191\n00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.260\nthen go ahead and grab that.\n\n192\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.400\nThat's usually what a lot of people do.\n\n193\n00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.350\n&gt;&gt; That's probably a pretty good idea.\n\n194\n00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.920\nUser trusted software provider.\n\n195\n00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.680\nSo, if you have others and\nyou wanna put their key in here,\n\n196\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.960\nthey're trusted, and so\nthey're added to your trusted list,\n\n197\n00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.940\nas opposed to your untrusted,\nwhich is everybody else.\n\n198\n00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.900\nAdditional drivers, you could search and\nright now searching and we're not looking.\n\n199\n00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.260\nAnd then this is if you,\nthese are proposed updates,\n\n200\n00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.380\nyou're only gonna do this if\nyou really got some guts.\n\n201\n00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.835\nThese are proposed updates.\n\n202\n00:09:55.835 --> 00:09:57.220\n&gt;&gt; So, like in a beta version?\n\n203\n00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.440\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthey haven't been totally tested yet.\n\n204\n00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So you're gonna be a tester here.\n\n205\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.010\nSo that goes through, and\nprovides you with that.\n\n206\n00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.845\nOops, let me close, and\nI'm getting out-of-date information, but\n\n207\n00:10:07.845 --> 00:10:08.782\nthat doesn't matter.\n\n208\n00:10:08.782 --> 00:10:14.982\nSo, the next thing that we're\ngonna look at is software, okay?\n\n209\n00:10:14.982 --> 00:10:19.418\nAnd the reason we're gonna be looking\nat software is we're actually going to\n\n210\n00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:21.740\ndownload that firewall.\n\n211\n00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.510\nOkay, and where do we go for that?\n\n212\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.420\nWell, we start out right here, right?\n\n213\n00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.780\nAnd this is the store,\n\n214\n00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:33.320\nwe're back in that store that we\nmentioned earlier, the Ubuntu store.\n\n215\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.130\nAnd if I'm looking for, and the software\nthat we're gonna first install\n\n216\n00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:43.220\nin this particular session\nis a firewall software, and\n\n217\n00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.530\nfirst of all- Do you need\na firewall with Ubuntu?\n\n218\n00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.970\nMaybe not, not so\nmuch as you would with Windows,\n\n219\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.770\nbecause it's not the greatest\nof attack targets.\n\n220\n00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.090\nBut it's probably a really\ngood idea to have it.\n\n221\n00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.548\nAnd so the way you would do it is\nyou would type in its name up here.\n\n222\n00:11:01.548 --> 00:11:08.290\nG-U-F-W, which is a firewall configuration\n\n223\n00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:13.470\nutility where we can open ports and\nclose ports, real simple to install.\n\n224\n00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.290\nI would just click the install button.\n\n225\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.050\nBut I figured that we might as well\nhave a, if that's all I have to do,\n\n226\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.960\nthat isn't much, right?\n\n227\n00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:29.630\nSo, why don't we just for the sake of\nhaving a little bit of fun go here and\n\n228\n00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:35.930\nwe'll go to terminal, okay?\n\n229\n00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:43.420\nSo, I bring up the terminal, and\nthis is our terminal, right?\n\n230\n00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:43.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n231\n00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.200\n&gt;&gt; And so what I want to do is I want\nto go through and do the install.\n\n232\n00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.818\nNow, we know that I can't do it,\nunless I start\n\n233\n00:11:49.818 --> 00:11:53.072\nout by saying I want to do this in a root\n&gt;&gt; Root privilege, yeah.\n\n234\n00:11:53.072 --> 00:11:55.767\n&gt;&gt; In a root S-U-D-O, right?\n\n235\n00:11:55.767 --> 00:11:56.406\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n236\n00:11:56.406 --> 00:11:57.488\n&gt;&gt; And we do a space.\n\n237\n00:11:57.488 --> 00:12:01.901\nNow, this is,\nnot all versions of Linux use\n\n238\n00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:07.200\nthe same commands relative to installing.\n\n239\n00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.050\nBut what we wanna do for Ubuntu,\n\n240\n00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.910\nit is install, first of all it's sudo,\nso we raised the level.\n\n241\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.611\nAnd then we go through and\nit is apt-get, and\n\n242\n00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:21.710\nthen we gotta say what we're gonna do.\n\n243\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.695\nSo, this says, and we're gonna install,\n\n244\n00:12:24.695 --> 00:12:29.910\nokay, and\nthen we have to tell it what to install.\n\n245\n00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.350\nNow, as you saw we went through\nthat other one back here,\n\n246\n00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.340\nlet me see if I can\nspring it up real quick.\n\n247\n00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.640\nThis is the G-U-F-A, right?\n\n248\n00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.740\n&gt;&gt; This one G-U-F-W.\n\n249\n00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.740\n&gt;&gt; I mean W, excuse me, W.\n\n250\n00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.400\nThat was a test.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n251\n00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.400\n&gt;&gt; I was just testing, I was just testing-\n\n252\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n253\n00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.550\n&gt;&gt; That the jerky was awake, okay.\n\n254\n00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.240\nAnd that's my excuse,\nand I'm sticking to it.\n\n255\n00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.170\nSo, what I'm gonna do is go through,\nand I'm gonna type in that.\n\n256\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.600\nOne of the challenges, and\nthis is a perfect example,\n\n257\n00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.200\nif I'm gonna type it in wrong, okay,\nbecause I don't pay attention.\n\n258\n00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.200\nI'm a Windows user.\n\n259\n00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.760\nI do G-U-F-W, now,\nthat looks right, right?\n\n260\n00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n261\n00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:14.049\n&gt;&gt; And so if I enter it, oops,\nsudo, oops I got to do my password.\n\n262\n00:13:14.049 --> 00:13:18.105\nIt's actually wrong, so-\n&gt;&gt; Will it give you an error message here?\n\n263\n00:13:18.105 --> 00:13:19.998\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you'll see it in a second.\n\n264\n00:13:19.998 --> 00:13:21.519\n&gt;&gt; Okay, go ahead and use a capital G.\n\n265\n00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:23.364\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you gotta use a capital G.\n\n266\n00:13:25.849 --> 00:13:30.070\nSo oops, it took it, did it take it?\n\n267\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.500\nYeah, it took it,\nit should not have taken it.\n\n268\n00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.010\nThat's interesting, because it\nreally should not have taken it.\n\n269\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.010\nSo right now, it's loading that package.\n\n270\n00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because it should've had to have\n\n271\n00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.430\nthe capital G.\n\n272\n00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.700\nOkay, cuz it is case sensitive.\n\n273\n00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.600\nThey probably in the store-\n&gt;&gt; So it's probably still a good idea to\n\n274\n00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.700\nget used to following the cases,\nupper, lowercase.\n\n275\n00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.750\nBut maybe some of the newer pieces of\nsoftware are being a little more flexible\n\n276\n00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.435\nwith your typing skills.\n\n277\n00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:57.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right now,\n\n278\n00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:03.600\nyou're seeing it's going through, doing\nthe unpacking of this firewall product.\n\n279\n00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.210\nWe hope it's the firewall product and\nnot something else.\n\n280\n00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.938\n&gt;&gt; Grand arbitrary, yeah.\n\n281\n00:14:07.938 --> 00:14:12.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it'll be interesting to see.\n\n282\n00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.310\nBut I assume that yeah, unpacking.\n\n283\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.480\nSo now it's unpacking it, okay?\n\n284\n00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.530\nSo, you can see that it's\ngoing through this process,\n\n285\n00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:25.740\nit would actually be going through the\nsame process behind the scenes in the GUI,\n\n286\n00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.720\nwe would just be not seeing\nall of this going on.\n\n287\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.771\nSo it's setting it up.\n\n288\n00:14:34.565 --> 00:14:36.401\nAnd yeah, and in IT,\n\n289\n00:14:36.401 --> 00:14:41.945\nyou guys will find that you gotta\nhurry up and wait a lot of times.\n\n290\n00:14:41.945 --> 00:14:44.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I can't even tell you,\n\n291\n00:14:44.215 --> 00:14:47.600\nyeah, how many times you gotta\nwait on the technology there.\n\n292\n00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.450\n&gt;&gt; So, here we are.\n\n293\n00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.710\nAnd I think we're done.\n\n294\n00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.790\nDoes it look done?\n\n295\n00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.176\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n296\n00:14:54.176 --> 00:14:55.556\n&gt;&gt; Looks like it's unpacked.\n\n297\n00:14:55.556 --> 00:14:57.230\nSo, let's go down here.\n\n298\n00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.350\nLet's see if it ended\nup up here somewhere.\n\n299\n00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.310\nHm, interesting.\n\n300\n00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.830\n&gt;&gt; Under settings.\n\n301\n00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.970\n&gt;&gt; Let me go here and go,\nsince it's software, GE, right here.\n\n302\n00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.640\nYou see it there?\n\n303\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.140\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n304\n00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.847\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it did install it.\n\n305\n00:15:19.847 --> 00:15:22.692\nAnd we're able to get\nto it through the GUI.\n\n306\n00:15:22.692 --> 00:15:27.036\nWe could also get to it through\nthe non GUI, but, that we're here.\n\n307\n00:15:27.036 --> 00:15:28.257\nSo, I'll type in my password.\n\n308\n00:15:35.997 --> 00:15:37.430\nAnd there it is here.\n\n309\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.420\nSo, this is the firewall product.\n\n310\n00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.140\nAnd you can see that we've got\na bunch of things that we can do.\n\n311\n00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.060\nWe have rules.\n\n312\n00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.860\nWe have no rules that we have created, but\nwe certainly could go through and do them.\n\n313\n00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.750\nThis is a report of the existing rules.\n\n314\n00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.590\nLet me see if I can drag\nthis over a little bit.\n\n315\n00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:58.170\nAnd it gives us the applications\nthat are associated with them.\n\n316\n00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.630\nThese are applications that\nare already installed.\n\n317\n00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.890\nAnd so as you can see,\n\n318\n00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.904\nthis is where would do our\nconfiguration relative to the firewall.\n\n319\n00:16:07.904 --> 00:16:12.343\nWe would create incoming and outgoing\nrules, and we would go through and\n\n320\n00:16:12.343 --> 00:16:15.417\ndo a whole bunch of processes\nhere if we wanted to.\n\n321\n00:16:15.417 --> 00:16:16.496\n&gt;&gt; Not so intimidating.\n\n322\n00:16:16.496 --> 00:16:18.120\n&gt;&gt; No, it really isn't.\n\n323\n00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.830\nIt really isn't.\n\n324\n00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.450\nNotice up here they want money?\n\n325\n00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n326\n00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.200\n&gt;&gt; If you have it, and\nyou appreciate the product,\n\n327\n00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.080\nthen definitely donate to these\ncompanies if you're using them.\n\n328\n00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:29.782\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n329\n00:16:29.782 --> 00:16:33.616\nSo, that's it, I think, pretty much it,\ndo we have much more on this?\n\n330\n00:16:33.616 --> 00:16:34.567\n&gt;&gt; No, that was actually it.\n\n331\n00:16:34.567 --> 00:16:38.497\nWe do have another portion here for\nbasic command line security, so don't go\n\n332\n00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:42.311\nanywhere, we have some more configuration\nfor you coming up for you guys.\n\n333\n00:16:42.311 --> 00:16:45.063\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this particular episode.\n\n334\n00:16:45.063 --> 00:16:47.546\nAnd I'll sign off as your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n335\n00:16:47.546 --> 00:16:49.604\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n336\n00:16:49.604 --> 00:16:51.810\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here for\ncyberpatriot.\n\n337\n00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:59.255\n[MUSIC]\n\n338\n00:16:59.255 --> 00:17:01.295\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.353 --> 00:00:15.695\n&gt;&gt; Welcome cyber patriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n6\n00:00:15.695 --> 00:00:17.985\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.045\nIn this particular episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:23.245\nwe're going to be looking at our\nbasic commando lines security.\n\n9\n00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:25.885\nWith us today,\nwe have Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n10\n00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:27.255\nThank you for joining us Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:27.825\nHi, everybody!\n\n12\n00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:31.675\nYeah, we'll gonna go through and\nlook at basic commands and\n\n13\n00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:34.555\nwe're actually not gonna do many of these,\nif any of these,\n\n14\n00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.160\nas simply just because\nwe've done it in the past.\n\n15\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.970\n&gt;&gt; So rather than repeat what we've done,\nI think it's easier just to move forward.\n\n16\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.440\nSo let's just look at this first slide.\n\n17\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.500\nThis is one we introduced\na couple of videos ago.\n\n18\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.786\nAnd this is the gedit command.\n\n19\n00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:50.908\nOne thing I want to remind\nyou of with regard to gedit.\n\n20\n00:00:50.908 --> 00:00:55.822\nAnd that was the fact that it doesn't\nnecessarily exist as a program on all\n\n21\n00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.575\ndistributions of Linux.\n\n22\n00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:05.462\nYou may recall that when we brought up the\nversion where we had the course in Linux,\n\n23\n00:01:05.462 --> 00:01:12.339\nwho was that that I provided you with\nthat course, and there's a link.\n\n24\n00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:13.767\nWhere you can actually go,\n\n25\n00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:18.200\nit's basic Linux commands-\n&gt;&gt; It was the NDG-\n\n26\n00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.807\n&gt;&gt; Well, the version they're using does\n\n27\n00:01:20.807 --> 00:01:22.909\nnot have gedit in it-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n28\n00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:23.820\n&gt;&gt; So I use piko.\n\n29\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.240\nI brought up as another example, which is\na common editor in Linux distributions.\n\n30\n00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.480\nSo, just because it's here it doesn't mean\nit's in every version but it is in Ubuntu.\n\n31\n00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.260\nIt's very very easy to use.\n\n32\n00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.779\nYou saw that.\n\n33\n00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:38.880\nYou just basically type it.\n\n34\n00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.230\nAnd you type the file path and\nthe file name.\n\n35\n00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.340\nAnd you may want to well do what\nI do with regard to file paths.\n\n36\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.490\nI actually drop into that file path.\n\n37\n00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.900\nSo that I don't end up\nwith a big long command.\n\n38\n00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.000\n&gt;&gt; To type for the syntax thing.\n\n39\n00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n40\n00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.340\nIt's an easier thing for me.\n\n41\n00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.750\nIt is what I do.\n\n42\n00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.910\nAnd then you can go through, and you can\nedit it, and there are other things that\n\n43\n00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.582\nyou can do with regard to gedit,\nincluding creating backup copies of files.\n\n44\n00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:05.260\nBut they're talked about here.\n\n45\n00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if we look at my screen,\n\n46\n00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.010\nthere's actually an example for\nthis next slide here.\n\n47\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.610\nWhere we can use gedit to\nturn off the guest account.\n\n48\n00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.250\nSo, I don't know if you wanted to go-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can talk about that,\n\n49\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.620\nbecause we're gonna be using it.\n\n50\n00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.386\nWe're gonna be showing\nyou where you can use it.\n\n51\n00:02:21.386 --> 00:02:25.980\nObviously you probably are gonna\nare get points in a cyber patriot\n\n52\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.990\ncompetition if the guest account\nis enabled and it shouldn't be.\n\n53\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.760\nAnd so you can go in and\nyou can edit the file relating to that.\n\n54\n00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.800\nYou can see down here, that first thing\nyou have to do is you have to get\n\n55\n00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.340\nroot authentication, meaning you're gonna\nuse, in the command line, you're gonna use\n\n56\n00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.450\nthe pseudo command to get you there if\nyou're not in the command line setup.\n\n57\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.640\nFirst of all, you really need to be at\nthat root level to use this product but\n\n58\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.990\nyou can eventually drill down and\nget to this particular folder.\n\n59\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.880\nRemember until you SUDO you cant\nget down to the etc folder.\n\n60\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.783\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n61\n00:03:09.783 --> 00:03:13.729\nIt'll just block you as a first security\nmechanism, wont allow you to get that far.\n\n62\n00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:17.280\n&gt;&gt; Right so you have to get in and\nedit it and it's a text file.\n\n63\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.330\nAll this configuration files\nare text files so you can go and\n\n64\n00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.900\nyou can actually edit it.\n\n65\n00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.546\nThey give you instructions\nhere on how to do it,\n\n66\n00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:28.597\nwe're not gonna do it because I want\nyou to have the experience doing it.\n\n67\n00:03:28.597 --> 00:03:32.512\nI'm not sure you'd benefit much by\nme sitting here trying to type and\n\n68\n00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:33.734\nyou're looking at.\n\n69\n00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:37.758\nThe next one is the PAM file okay.\n\n70\n00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:43.300\nSo this particular file it relates\nto logging on and applications.\n\n71\n00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.420\nThere are four kinds of files\nas they mentioned here.\n\n72\n00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.060\nWe have an account file.\n\n73\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.260\nWe have an authentication.\n\n74\n00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.200\nWe have a password where we can control\npassword policy and we have sessions.\n\n75\n00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.720\nAnd so you can actually go through and\nedit those files.\n\n76\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.460\nThis particular busy slide,\n\n77\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.410\nthe next one up, explains how you\nwould go through and do them.\n\n78\n00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.820\nIt's really busy.\n\n79\n00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.410\nWhat I would do is I would\nactually print this,\n\n80\n00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.010\nhave it next to your laptop or-\n&gt;&gt; Use it as an instruction list?\n\n81\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, basically use it as an\ninstruction list and we can go through and\n\n82\n00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.870\nwe can set the password history for\nexample.\n\n83\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.780\nThey have it on this screen\nyou set it to five and\n\n84\n00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.660\nto enforce a password length of\na mandatory eight characters or more.\n\n85\n00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.140\nThat's the minimum.\n\n86\n00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.600\nYou can do that sort of stuff.\n\n87\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.250\nYou can enforce password\ncomplexities with different types of\n\n88\n00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.180\nupper case, lower case, special character,\nnumbers, that sort of thing.\n\n89\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.490\nYou can identify What's necessary.\n\n90\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.120\nSo that's this particular slide.\n\n91\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.110\nSo you go through on your own time and\ninside of Ubuntu,\n\n92\n00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.020\ndo these sorts of things, these exercises.\n\n93\n00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.690\n&gt;&gt; Practice.\n\n94\n00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, practice makes perfect, right?\n\n95\n00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n97\n00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.510\nI can't strive to be perfect but\n\n98\n00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.116\nI just strive to be better\nthan who I was yesterday.\n\n99\n00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:01.390\n[LAUGH] That's my motto.\n\n100\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n101\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.400\nOkay, and\nthen we'll go to the next slide and\n\n102\n00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.100\nthis is one where you can\nmodify the password history.\n\n103\n00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.572\nThey give you an example of,\nare we on a different slide?\n\n104\n00:05:13.572 --> 00:05:15.472\n&gt;&gt; Oops, nope, this one is account policy.\n\n105\n00:05:15.472 --> 00:05:17.280\n&gt;&gt; Whoops!\n\n106\n00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.200\nOkay, yeah,\ngo to the next one though, I think.\n\n107\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.760\nBut wait, I'm running it.\n\n108\n00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.230\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I'm running the slides.\n\n109\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.590\nHere I am telling you what.\n\n110\n00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.430\nSo, here we are, this is-\n&gt;&gt; No we both have the same slides pulled\n\n111\n00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.450\nup, so I couldn't tell.\n\n112\n00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.102\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nusing gedit to edit password history.\n\n113\n00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:36.770\nAs you can see they give you instructions\non which file you should go to to do this,\n\n114\n00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.480\nand how you should do it.\n\n115\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.140\nIt's step by step instructions.\n\n116\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.520\nAnd I would encourage you to go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n117\n00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.570\nAnd then the next one is\nsetting account policies.\n\n118\n00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.430\nThis is where we're doing that setting\nwhere if you try too many times it\n\n119\n00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.500\nlocks it-\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n120\n00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.130\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's what this is all about.\n\n121\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.673\nSimple instructions here on how to do it.\n\n122\n00:05:58.673 --> 00:06:03.235\nAgain you're editing a text file so you\ngotta make sure your on the right file.\n\n123\n00:06:03.235 --> 00:06:04.434\n&gt;&gt; With the right permissions.\n\n124\n00:06:04.434 --> 00:06:05.771\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nWith the right permission.\n\n125\n00:06:05.771 --> 00:06:08.874\nMake sure you sudo, well you wouldn't\nget into this directory unless you,\n\n126\n00:06:08.874 --> 00:06:09.948\nif you weren't an admin.\n\n127\n00:06:09.948 --> 00:06:14.896\nYeah, if you you weren't an admin or\na root I guess I should say.\n\n128\n00:06:14.896 --> 00:06:16.865\nAnd that's pretty much it.\n\n129\n00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:20.135\nSo, I think we're through\nwith this particular section.\n\n130\n00:06:20.135 --> 00:06:22.725\n&gt;&gt; So, we can see here how\nthe command line is very, or\n\n131\n00:06:22.725 --> 00:06:25.255\nthe terminal I should say, is very useful.\n\n132\n00:06:25.255 --> 00:06:29.030\nWe have tools, like gedit,\nthat can really allow us to go ahead and\n\n133\n00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.330\nmodify a lot of security settings.\n\n134\n00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.450\nWe also talked about pam files and\nyou guys do have some homework ahead of\n\n135\n00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.250\nyou to go ahead and get familiarized\nwith going through those steps.\n\n136\n00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.040\nJust so that you can be confident in\nconfiguring and working in that terminal.\n\n137\n00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.590\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap it up for this episode.\n\n138\n00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.870\nSo we'll see you next time, but for\nthis episode we're signing off.\n\n139\n00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.610\nAnd I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n140\n00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.610\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Professor Steve Linthicum.\n\n141\n00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.987\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here for\nCyber Patriot.\n\n142\n00:06:54.987 --> 00:07:01.859\n[MUSIC]\n\n143\n00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:06.334\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:15.825\n&gt;&gt; Welcome cyber patriots to\nanother online training video.\n\n5\n00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:18.403\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:19.157\nIn this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:23.540\nwe're gonna go ahead and get introduced\nsome advanced Ubuntu security mechanism.\n\n8\n00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.300\nWith us today, we have\nProfessor Steve Linthicum to go ahead and\n\n9\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.460\ncover these topics.\n\n10\n00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.780\nThank you for being here, Steve.\n\n11\n00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Hi and thank you for having me here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.370\nThis has been a great opportunity for\n\n13\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.100\nme because this is probably\nthe last in the series.\n\n14\n00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.785\nAnd hopefully these videos for\nyou students make a lot of sense and\n\n15\n00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:44.408\nreally help you as you try to learn your\ncyber security techniques and knowledge.\n\n16\n00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:47.528\nSo that you can go out and\njoin the workforce and\n\n17\n00:00:47.528 --> 00:00:51.537\nget a really high paying job,\nI guess I should phrase it as.\n\n18\n00:00:51.537 --> 00:00:55.120\nSo what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to look at the advance features.\n\n19\n00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.500\nAnd, why dont we bring up the first slide.\n\n20\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.110\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n21\n00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n22\n00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.751\nSo what we're looking at\nfirst is the ls command and\n\n23\n00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:07.430\nbasically what it is,\nis it provides much the same as in DOS.\n\n24\n00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.500\nIf you type dir, a whole bunch of\ninformation relative to the sort of\n\n25\n00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.900\nthings you would wanna know about files,\nand permissions, and a variety of things.\n\n26\n00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.280\nAnd so what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna go through and\n\n27\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.090\nshow you on my screen what the ls\ncommand looks like when you initiate it.\n\n28\n00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.770\nSo here is my screen,\nthis is the terminal.\n\n29\n00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.950\nAnd if I type in ls, oops that's la I must\nbe wanting to head back to the West Coast.\n\n30\n00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.890\nOkay so there is ls, and as you can see,\nwe don't get much there,\n\n31\n00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.600\nbut if we do ll, we get a tone of stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.150\nOkay?\n\n33\n00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n34\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.410\n&gt;&gt; So what we have here is we have\nthe different permissions associated\n\n35\n00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.560\nover on the left hand side\n&gt;&gt; These are the permissions associated\n\n36\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.580\nwith each file or folder,\ndrive, or directory.\n\n37\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.840\nProbably directory is a better\nterm in this environment.\n\n38\n00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.700\nBut you get back to that same old thing\nwhere I don't know what to call things\n\n39\n00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.800\nbecause I'm bouncing back and\n\n40\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.900\nforth from Windows to-\n&gt;&gt; It happens.\n\n41\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.555\n&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah.\n\n42\n00:02:13.555 --> 00:02:14.295\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n43\n00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:15.830\n&gt;&gt; Usually people kind of pick their\n\n44\n00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.740\npoison here, but for you guys you might\nwanna go ahead and just cross trains.\n\n45\n00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.010\nSo that you're really flexible if someone\nis missing for a competition or wherever.\n\n46\n00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.512\nBut you know you might just find\nyour niche and then you really say,\n\n47\n00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:28.600\nhey I love Linux.\n\n48\n00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.347\nAs a matter of fact one of our hosts here,\nI won't mention any names.\n\n49\n00:02:31.347 --> 00:02:34.797\nBut for the longest time he was\nknown as the Microsoft guy and\n\n50\n00:02:34.797 --> 00:02:37.610\nrecently he's been dabbling in Linux.\n\n51\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.440\nAnd even just today I heard him say he's\nlike you know I'm really starting just\n\n52\n00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.520\nto love bash.\n\n53\n00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.347\nAnd I was like wow.\n\n54\n00:02:42.347 --> 00:02:43.775\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:45.936\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A true conversion in in\n\n56\n00:02:45.936 --> 00:02:47.200\nprogress.\n\n57\n00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.057\nSo basically what we're gonna do is I just\nwanted to show you this slide to give you\n\n58\n00:02:51.057 --> 00:02:52.942\nsome sense of the kind of information.\n\n59\n00:02:52.942 --> 00:02:55.156\nYou've got data out there,\n\n60\n00:02:55.156 --> 00:02:59.960\nas you can see some of these\nwere August 26, and then a time.\n\n61\n00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.770\nSo you're given a creation or\nthe change date relative to it.\n\n62\n00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.840\nWho the owner is, what, just a whole\nfile size, all kinds of information.\n\n63\n00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.880\nThen over to the left are the file and\nfolder permissions.\n\n64\n00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.510\nSo why don't we go back to the slide.\n\n65\n00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's take a look at that\nbecause this slide kind of, okay, good.\n\n66\n00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.220\nIt's not completely getting\ncut off there behind my head.\n\n67\n00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.560\nBut if we look at these Rs and Ws, if you\ncan recall in the Windows environment.\n\n68\n00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.390\nWe had different levels of permissions,\nsuch as read and write and modify.\n\n69\n00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.190\nSo here it's kind of the same thing,\nit's just in a different format.\n\n70\n00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.770\nSo if we look here,\nwe actually have three different sections,\n\n71\n00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.670\nif you look vertically,\nthree different sets of rules.\n\n72\n00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.100\nSo this part would be for file one,\nthe actual name of the file.\n\n73\n00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.580\nSo I will say four,\nfirst we're looking at the owner, so\n\n74\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.320\nthis first RW states that\nthe owner can read and write.\n\n75\n00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.258\nHence, modify, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:01.258 --> 00:04:06.321\nNow, the second Column here is for groups.\n\n77\n00:04:06.321 --> 00:04:10.242\nNow group members can read and write,\nso that permission is the same.\n\n78\n00:04:10.242 --> 00:04:13.585\nBut other permissions for\nany other remaining groups,\n\n79\n00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:18.335\nthey only have the read permission,\nnot granting them the modify there.\n\n80\n00:04:18.335 --> 00:04:21.100\nNow, In Linux, it is interesting.\n\n81\n00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.780\nThey go ahead and assign numerical\nvalue for each one of these positions.\n\n82\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.490\nYou can just sum up the total\nof that numerical value so\n\n83\n00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.920\nthat the system can look at it that way.\n\n84\n00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.320\nBut, you guys can go ahead and use your\nstudy resources to go further in that.\n\n85\n00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.520\nThis is just the basic information.\n\n86\n00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.080\nLike Steve was showing you on\nhis slide there or screen.\n\n87\n00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.760\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so let's go on to the next\nslide we'll work through these.\n\n88\n00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.420\nSo again, if you go to this next slide,\nthis is the chmod file.\n\n89\n00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.380\nThis is where you're gonna\nmodify the permissions,\n\n90\n00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.360\nthe file permissions with\nregards to files and folders.\n\n91\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.890\nAnd you're gonna actually go through and\ngive additional or\n\n92\n00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.090\ntake away additional privileges\nassociated with them.\n\n93\n00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.270\nAnd it's identified up here and explained.\n\n94\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.720\nThis is again, one of those situations\nwhere we could do it on the screen.\n\n95\n00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.270\nBut it's really better with a lot of these\ncommands that you do them on your own.\n\n96\n00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.230\nThat way, you're experiencing the results.\n\n97\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.021\nYou're experiencing the failure\nto type quite correctly.\n\n98\n00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:27.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That kind of scratching your head\n\n99\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.690\ntrying to figure out\nwhy things don't work.\n\n100\n00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.340\nSo again, I think we're just gonna,\nthey tell you here it's step one, two and\n\n101\n00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.720\nthree and\nthis is what you're gonna be doing.\n\n102\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.840\nSo I would proceed.\n\n103\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.650\nJust follow the slide as a direction.\n\n104\n00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.070\nThere are also if you go out in the\ninternet for these sorts of activities.\n\n105\n00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.339\nThere are lot of instructions\non how to do it.\n\n106\n00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:49.810\nAnd, again,\nI go back to that Linux learning series of\n\n107\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.782\nlessons that you have the 20\nthat were available from NDG.\n\n108\n00:05:54.782 --> 00:05:56.486\nAnd I would encourage you to go there and\n\n109\n00:05:56.486 --> 00:05:59.540\ngo through all this because they'll\nactually have you doing it.\n\n110\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.968\nThey'll have the instructions on the left.\n\n111\n00:06:00.968 --> 00:06:07.130\nAnd the Linux distribution live machine.\n\n112\n00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.260\nThat's a live machine where you're going\nthrough and typing these commands.\n\n113\n00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.860\nSo that's a great resource\nthrough all of this.\n\n114\n00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.180\nWe have the systems log.\n\n115\n00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.630\nThat's here next.\n\n116\n00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.985\nAnd basically this is where you\nwould turn on or off logs so\n\n117\n00:06:20.985 --> 00:06:23.359\nthat you can be doing logging.\n\n118\n00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:27.720\nWhich is one thing you obviously want\nto do in a sort of server environment.\n\n119\n00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.440\nThat Unix or Linux is involved in,\nyou want to log activities.\n\n120\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.140\nBecause they're your direct\nresource to ascertain whether or\n\n121\n00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.940\nnot you have security issues going on.\n\n122\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.280\nSo you can go through here and\n\n123\n00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.390\ndeal with the four types of logs they\nidentify them here on the slide.\n\n124\n00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.030\nI won't go through them but,\ntheir definitions are there.\n\n125\n00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.550\nAnd you can set up the audit policies\nwith regard to these by downloading and\n\n126\n00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.740\ninstalling.\n\n127\n00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.080\nThey've got a program\nassociated with this and\n\n128\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.540\nyou'd use the command\nline to do that probably.\n\n129\n00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.908\nI don't know whether it's available\nfrom the Ubuntu software store,\n\n130\n00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:06.080\nI kind of doubt it.\n\n131\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.190\nSo you can go through and do that.\n\n132\n00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.570\nYou can add groups for example.\n\n133\n00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.400\nThis is the same sort of thing that you\nwould do in a Microsoft environment.\n\n134\n00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.170\nYou would create groups for\njob roles and you can do that.\n\n135\n00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.620\nYou can add users we\nalready experienced that.\n\n136\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.510\n&gt;&gt; And\nits kind of funny that we see end users\n\n137\n00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.861\nactually requesting these types\nof commands to Microsoft.\n\n138\n00:07:28.861 --> 00:07:34.430\nAnd guess what they did well In 2008,\nthey started pushing out PowerShell.\n\n139\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.340\nServer 2012 got a little more heavier.\n\n140\n00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.200\nA little more laden with PowerShell.\n\n141\n00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.800\n2016 comes out, and they've really\ndeveloped that baby, PowerShell.\n\n142\n00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.790\nAnd it all really spawned\nfrom users requesting for\n\n143\n00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.560\nMicrosoft to be a little more like Linux.\n\n144\n00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.149\nSo it's kind of interesting there.\n\n145\n00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:50.944\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n146\n00:07:50.944 --> 00:07:53.510\nAnd you'll find that a dedicated server.\n\n147\n00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.940\nIn a Microsoft environment,\nthe GUI isn't there.\n\n148\n00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.990\nAs a matter of fact,\nthe GUI has become an application.\n\n149\n00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.530\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n150\n00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.350\n&gt;&gt; I guess we could say the same thing for\nLinux.\n\n151\n00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.500\nSo there's even more\nevidence that Microsoft,\n\n152\n00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.595\nwell they probably invented\nit in their own minds first.\n\n153\n00:08:09.595 --> 00:08:11.493\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because that's the way-\n\n154\n00:08:11.493 --> 00:08:12.425\n&gt;&gt; We won't go there-\n\n155\n00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:15.701\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we won't go there but,0 yeah, so\n\n156\n00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:17.780\nit's amazing.\n\n157\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.570\n&gt;&gt; So we still, we can use that\ncommand line interface to go ahead and\n\n158\n00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.540\nadd our groups like we could do\nalso in a Microsoft environment.\n\n159\n00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.790\nWe won't say who got there first.\n\n160\n00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.734\nI think it's pretty obvious, but yeah.\n\n161\n00:08:27.734 --> 00:08:29.780\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n162\n00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.446\n&gt;&gt; And then on our last slide here we're\n\n163\n00:08:31.446 --> 00:08:35.190\nlooking at services and this is where\nwe'd go ahead and install that bum.\n\n164\n00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\nwhy don't you come to my machine here.\n\n165\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.870\nAnd I know I've done it a couple of times\nwhere I can do it on the command line, and\n\n166\n00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.290\nit would be that same command.\n\n167\n00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.860\nIt would be pseudo, so\nI can get up to the administrative level.\n\n168\n00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:53.130\nIt would be apt, A-P-T, dash get and\nthen followed by install.\n\n169\n00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.700\nAnd then what we're talking about\nhere is the boot up manager.\n\n170\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And I guess what they call it,\n\n171\n00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.830\ncuz I don't, and that's too much to type.\n\n172\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:08.354\nSo in a Ubuntu environment,\nit's bum, B-U-M for boot up manager.\n\n173\n00:09:08.354 --> 00:09:09.306\n&gt;&gt; So boot up manager,\n\n174\n00:09:09.306 --> 00:09:12.275\nwhat would be the equivalent of\nthat in a Windows environment?\n\n175\n00:09:12.275 --> 00:09:17.114\n&gt;&gt; That would be, MSconfig might be.\n\n176\n00:09:17.114 --> 00:09:18.573\n&gt;&gt; They're kind of relatable there.\n\n177\n00:09:18.573 --> 00:09:20.067\n&gt;&gt; We're going to the startup.\n\n178\n00:09:20.067 --> 00:09:22.397\nRemember how we have those\nstartup applications,\n\n179\n00:09:22.397 --> 00:09:23.920\nwhere we would actually decide.\n\n180\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.350\nAnd look, I just got killed\nbecause I got bounced out.\n\n181\n00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.844\nIf my desktop wasn't doing anything-\n&gt;&gt; Timed out.\n\n182\n00:09:34.525 --> 00:09:36.267\nBut that just requires\nputting in the password and\n\n183\n00:09:36.267 --> 00:09:37.900\nwe're right back to where we were.\n\n184\n00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.950\nSo what I'm looking for\nhere is boot up manager.\n\n185\n00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.394\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So i guess we can type in b-o-o-t and\n\n186\n00:09:44.394 --> 00:09:46.364\nwe'll see whether it comes up.\n\n187\n00:09:48.492 --> 00:09:51.300\nThere it is right there, okay.\n\n188\n00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; So we go over here and\n\n189\n00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.690\nclick the magic install and guess what?\n\n190\n00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.447\nLet's see how it goes.\n\n191\n00:09:58.447 --> 00:10:01.984\nOf course, it doesn't go anywhere\nbecause I've got to provide,\n\n192\n00:10:01.984 --> 00:10:02.782\n&gt;&gt; Your password?\n\n193\n00:10:02.782 --> 00:10:03.363\n&gt;&gt; My password.\n\n194\n00:10:03.363 --> 00:10:10.839\nSo, Authenticate, and now as you can see,\nit's going through the process.\n\n195\n00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:16.660\nAnd what we're not seeing is what's\nhappening in a terminal window.\n\n196\n00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.080\n&gt;&gt; Background like we had seen before,\nyeah.\n\n197\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.371\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so we're looking at the, and we're\nsitting here, we're twiddling our thumbs.\n\n198\n00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:22.584\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nyou've got the little pinwheel there.\n\n199\n00:10:22.584 --> 00:10:23.475\n&gt;&gt; You've got the little thing going-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n200\n00:10:23.475 --> 00:10:24.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Around and round.\n\n201\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.310\n&gt;&gt; Be patient.\n\n202\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.695\n&gt;&gt; And yeah,\nexercise a degree of patience here.\n\n203\n00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:31.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can see that it clicked up,\n\n204\n00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.370\nit came up over here on the\n&gt;&gt; The icon-\n\n205\n00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.180\n&gt;&gt; The icon is right there.\n\n206\n00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.000\nWell, let it configure,\nit is still spinning.\n\n207\n00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.115\nI think it's up, but I am not so sure.\n\n208\n00:10:47.115 --> 00:10:48.683\nI don't know.\n\n209\n00:10:48.683 --> 00:10:50.474\nMaybe we'll click and see if it is up.\n\n210\n00:10:50.474 --> 00:10:50.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; How does that sound?\n\n211\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.010\nWait, that's firewall.\n\n212\n00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.660\nWhere is boot up manager.\n\n213\n00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes, It's underneath of our DOSbox.\n\n214\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.650\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\nOkay so I'm going to bring it up.\n\n215\n00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.430\nAnd of course guess what I'm asked to do?\n\n216\n00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.290\nBut it makes sense.\n\n217\n00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.540\nThis is a utility.\n\n218\n00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.850\n&gt;&gt; To modify that-\n&gt;&gt; To modify the operating system.\n\n219\n00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's starting up, so we got-\n\n220\n00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.230\n&gt;&gt; The boot process there.\n\n221\n00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:24.210\n&gt;&gt; So we bring it up and up it comes.\n\n222\n00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.070\nThat's progressing, but,\nagain, this is an application.\n\n223\n00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.220\nSo it's got to bring itself up,\nit's gotta get information.\n\n224\n00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:36.151\nBecause really what it's out there doing\nis it's quizzing the operating system,\n\n225\n00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:39.540\ntrying to find out what sort\nof applications are active.\n\n226\n00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:46.310\nAnd we would go through here much\nthe same as we would on MS config.\n\n227\n00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:51.630\n&gt;&gt; We could even kill a service or here\na demon that they would go ahead and call\n\n228\n00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.660\nit if it was causing a particular problem\non our system or something like that.\n\n229\n00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, and let me give you a sense here.\n\n230\n00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:58.860\nThis machine does have Bluetooth.\n\n231\n00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:08.110\nThis desktop but, I'm not sure it does\nin a virtual environment like this.\n\n232\n00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.580\nI would kinda doubt that it would.\n\n233\n00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.240\nBecause I don't think that I\nhave a virtual Bluetooth device.\n\n234\n00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.338\n&gt;&gt; Adapter?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, an adapter.\n\n235\n00:12:14.338 --> 00:12:19.490\nSo what I've done there\nbasically is I have eliminated\n\n236\n00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:23.864\nthat service from becoming\nactive on boot up.\n\n237\n00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:25.167\nAnd that would be-\n&gt;&gt; You might even\n\n238\n00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:27.702\nwanna do that on your physical machine if\nyou're gonna be in a public environment.\n\n239\n00:12:27.702 --> 00:12:29.900\nBecause there are a lot of exploits\nassociated with bluetooth.\n\n240\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so this gives me the\nopportunity to disable those services and\n\n241\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.550\njust click apply.\n\n242\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.810\nAnd you guys know at next boot up if\nI do it now, it will do it right now.\n\n243\n00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.480\nWe'll try right now just to see if it did.\n\n244\n00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.870\nAnd if we scroll down,\nis there any bluetooth there?\n\n245\n00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.530\n&gt;&gt; I don't see it.\n\n246\n00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.880\nWait!\n&gt;&gt; No, way down at the bottom but\n\n247\n00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.030\nit--\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n248\n00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.810\nBut it's--\n&gt;&gt; But it's not\n\n249\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.190\ngoing to be operational on\nthe next startup for sure.\n\n250\n00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.690\nIt won't come up.\n\n251\n00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:01.205\nAll right.\n\n252\n00:13:01.205 --> 00:13:04.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so is that it for that module?\n\n253\n00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.670\n&gt;&gt; Not only is that it for\nthis module, but it is kind of sad,\n\n254\n00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.230\nbecause that is it for\nour set of videos here.\n\n255\n00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.860\n&gt;&gt; Well it's been a pleasure, believe me.\n\n256\n00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.530\nI really enjoyed this, and\n\n257\n00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.430\nI hope you as students appreciate the fact\nthat we have done these lessons for you.\n\n258\n00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.440\nI want to thank everybody here at ITproTV.\n\n259\n00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.450\nA great place.\n\n260\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.230\nIf you get a chance go to their site,\nsee what sort of learning they have.\n\n261\n00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.927\nRecognize that this is a great\nopportunity for you to learn and\n\n262\n00:13:29.927 --> 00:13:32.496\nthey have other opportunities out there.\n\n263\n00:13:32.496 --> 00:13:33.724\nAnd I know I mentioned it on the past.\n\n264\n00:13:33.724 --> 00:13:36.239\nThey have the IT fundamentals\ncourse which is no cost and\n\n265\n00:13:36.239 --> 00:13:38.660\nthere is a certification\nassociated with it.\n\n266\n00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.700\nHopefully we can work out some sort\nof an arrangement with CompTIA\n\n267\n00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.520\nwhere with the CyberPatriot\ngroup I'm gonna try and\n\n268\n00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.300\nget all three of them in\nthe room at the same time.\n\n269\n00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.170\n&gt;&gt; That would be cool, yeah.\n\n270\n00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.870\n&gt;&gt; And see if we can get you going down\nthe path of industry certifications.\n\n271\n00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:57.396\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they were actually just over\nat a CompTIA conference in Australia.\n\n272\n00:13:57.396 --> 00:13:59.060\nSo [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Really-\n\n273\n00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.140\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you can go on a vacation.\n\n274\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.152\nWho knows, yeah.\n\n275\n00:14:02.152 --> 00:14:03.290\n&gt;&gt; Really cool stuff.\n\n276\n00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:09.430\nAnd again, please take advantage of the\nadditional content that has been provided.\n\n277\n00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.130\nYou've got the Cisco academy stuff.\n\n278\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.862\nThat's great stuff in there.\n\n279\n00:14:13.862 --> 00:14:15.326\n&gt;&gt; Yeah all of that.\n\n280\n00:14:15.326 --> 00:14:20.121\n&gt;&gt; Go through and your coach will be\nassigning you sections of the modules\n\n281\n00:14:20.121 --> 00:14:23.140\nthat have been set up for\nyou in the academy.\n\n282\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.160\nSo you can go through and\nlearn about packet tracer and\n\n283\n00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.850\nlearn about networking much more than we\nwere able to cover here in networking.\n\n284\n00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:31.930\nMuch more content.\n\n285\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.150\n&gt;&gt;
