Thank you very much.\n\n12\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.460\nAnd for you students out there,\none of the reasons why\n\n13\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.380\nI decided that this would be a great\nidea to work on putting this together,\n\n14\n00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.240\nis I looked at the materials that you\nhad available to you from Cyber Patriot.\n\n15\n00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.900\nThere were a whole series of slides,\nand we're going to use those slides so\n\n16\n00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.380\nthat we can present the materials in\na fashion that I think will be much\n\n17\n00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.310\neasier for you to absorb.\n\n18\n00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.450\nAnd I really want to thank ITProTV for\nallowing me to come here and to provide\n\n19\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.750\nyou with these materials because I think\nit'll really benefit you as students.\n\n20\n00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.880\nSo why don't we go over to\nthe slides that I prepared?\n\n21\n00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.280\nNow, that's just basically\nthe introductory slide.\n\n22\n00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.300\nBut as we go through it, I want to comment\nrelative to what I call resource partners.\n\n23\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.513\nAnd they're a bunch of entities that\nhelped put this project together.\n\n24\n00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:20.986\nObviously one of them is ITPROTV, but\nwe also have the CYBERPATRIOT program,\n\n25\n00:01:20.986 --> 00:01:22.817\nwe're using their materials,\n\n26\n00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:26.636\nyou're benefiting from what this\ngroup of individuals has done.\n\n27\n00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:29.697\nThey're sponsored by\nthe airforce association,\n\n28\n00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:34.108\nNorth of is a key sponsor associated\nwith them, we have NDG here,\n\n29\n00:01:34.108 --> 00:01:38.875\nNDG has a course that you're going to be\nable to have free access to The will teach\n\n30\n00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:42.030\nyou Linux principles and\nI think it's really good.\n\n31\n00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.950\nThere is incidentally with ITProTV,\nyou're also going to have access to\n\n32\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.870\na free IT fundamentals course, which we go\nthrough a little bit of networking here,\n\n33\n00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.220\nbut we can't cover it all.\n\n34\n00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.920\nSo you're gonna have access to that.\n\n35\n00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.080\nWe got the Cisco Network Academy\nthat's providing you\n\n36\n00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.930\naccess to their net academy program And\nthere are a whole\n\n37\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.565\nbunch of modules that your coach\nis going to have you go through.\n\n38\n00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:05.890\nThere.s Cyber Watch West,\n\n39\n00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.040\nthat's a academic centre of\nexcellence based out of Washington.\n\n40\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.025\nThey are a key participant.\n\n41\n00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:17.440\nWe;ve got My College Sierra College\nit's obviously a key participant and\n\n42\n00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.210\nthe North by North Regional Consortium\nmy college is a member of that.\n\n43\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.670\nThey've supported this effort.\n\n44\n00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.150\nAnd I really want to thank the California\nCommunity College Chancellor's Office that\n\n45\n00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.620\nhas provided funding for\n\n46\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.190\nthis particular effort under\ntheir doing what matters program.\n\n47\n00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.685\nSo these are all key resource-\n&gt;&gt; Looks like a lot of people really\n\n48\n00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:38.725\ncare and are putting forth efforts to go\nahead and make this initiative happen.\n\n49\n00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.295\nAnd Steven I do appreciate\nyou thanking ITProTV.\n\n50\n00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:45.486\nBut we'd like to thank you as well, and\nthank all of the adults and participants,\n\n51\n00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:47.870\nthe new students, as well, for doing this.\n\n52\n00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.540\nBecause it's such a great opportunity to\nreally set you up for a better lifestyle.\n\n53\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.230\n&gt;&gt; And the reason it's going to set\nyou up for a better lifestyle is,\n\n54\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.120\nif you prefer to go down this career path.\n\n55\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.280\nAs you go through here and\nyou learn cybersecurity.\n\n56\n00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.810\nIf you think, boy,\nthis would be fun to do as a job.\n\n57\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.780\nI want to show you this next slide,\nbecause I think it's really important.\n\n58\n00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.860\nThis is a recent slide shot,\na screen shot.\n\n59\n00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.380\nOf the CyberSeek site.\n\n60\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.470\nYou can go to it, it's at cyberseek.org.\n\n61\n00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.460\nIt was funded by NIST,\n\n62\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.000\nwhich is the National Institute of,\nwhat is it, Standards and Technology.\n\n63\n00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.500\n&gt;&gt; Technology.\n\n64\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sometimes I want to say-\n&gt;&gt; We have so many acronyms.\n\n65\n00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.645\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do.\n&gt;&gt; And you guys will find that out.\n\n66\n00:03:27.645 --> 00:03:28.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They do, and\n\n67\n00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.000\nif you look at this slide\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n68\n00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.420\nI pulled this last night\noff of the Internet.\n\n69\n00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.030\nIt indicates here in the lower\nleft hand corner that there\n\n70\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.150\nare currently in\nthe United States 348,975 jobs.\n\n71\n00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.840\n&gt;&gt; Overwhelming.\n\n72\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.450\n&gt;&gt; The workforce,\nthe totally employed workforce right now\n\n73\n00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.500\nis about three quarters of a million\n&gt;&gt; People, now slightly over that.\n\n74\n00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.270\nBut look at that.\n\n75\n00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.867\nall them are\n&gt;&gt; You see that huge deficit there.\n\n76\n00:03:55.867 --> 00:03:58.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThey're working all those 3 quarters of\n\n77\n00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.300\na million are working and yet\nwe have vacancies in 300,\n\n78\n00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.000\nin almost 350,000 positions,\nso there is a heck of\n\n79\n00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.110\nan opportunity here across the nation\nrelative to jobs out there.\n\n80\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.340\nAnd what we need,\nis we need people in those jobs.\n\n81\n00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.680\nAnd you're well equipped to get there.\n\n82\n00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.880\nYou go through the Cyber Patriot program,\n\n83\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.120\nperhaps go to a community\ncollege like Sierra,\n\n84\n00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.220\ngo through our training programs that are\ntied to industry driven certifications.\n\n85\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.780\nAnd that's funny with cybersecurity and\nwith a lot of IT,\n\n86\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.250\nthose industry driven certifications\nare of utmost importance.\n\n87\n00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.740\nThey prove to employers\nthat you know something.\n\n88\n00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.630\nThey prove to employers\nbecause to keep them,\n\n89\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.740\nyou've got to continue\ncontinuing education we call it.\n\n90\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.360\n&gt;&gt; Lifelong learners.\n\n91\n00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah lifelong learners.\n\n92\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.690\nAnd so it's really important that you go\nthrough and you achieve those objectives.\n\n93\n00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.110\nAnd what a great job this is.\n\n94\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.280\nThe key elements of it with regard\nto cybersecurity here, it's a bit of\n\n95\n00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.160\na challenge for companies and for\ngovernments to outsource cybersecurity.\n\n96\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.990\nBeyond the jurisdictional limits of\nthe courts of the United States.\n\n97\n00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.120\nThe FBI can't chase you in Eastern Europe\nvery well if you do something wrong,\n\n98\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.270\nso the employers are going to want to\nmake sure you're from this country and\n\n99\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.820\nyou're in this country\nas you do your work.\n\n100\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.670\nAnother great news about this job is\nbecause so much of what you do is remote,\n\n101\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.790\nmeaning you're going to remote into\nsystems, you don't necessarily\n\n102\n00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.170\nneed to be in an office building, your\ncompany's office building to do your work.\n\n103\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.565\nYou might be working from home,\nyou might be working from the beach.\n\n104\n00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:38.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There really are so many\nbenefits in working in IT, and personally\n\n105\n00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.270\n&gt;&gt; Personally,\n\n106\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.530\nI got into IT to really just\nbetter my family's life, and\n\n107\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.150\nthat's why I say it's possible for\nyou to do the same.\n\n108\n00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.130\nBecause I didn't have a cyber\npatriot program like this.\n\n109\n00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.070\nI really wish I did, because I am just so\n\n110\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.770\nimpressed with the amount of resources\nthat you guys have available to you.\n\n111\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.840\nAnd here's the thing.\n\n112\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.800\nEven if you already don't have\na really solid knowledge base,\n\n113\n00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.610\nthat's okay, because you have\na lot of tools at your disposal.\n\n114\n00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.120\nRight and a couple things I wanted\nto cover briefly back on the slides.\n\n115\n00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.450\nThe way that we've broken this out\ngenerally is at the beginning of\n\n116\n00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.280\neach unit and I believe there are ten\nunits, you'll have the opening slide.\n\n117\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.500\nFor example here it will identify\nUnit One with its heading.\n\n118\n00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.980\nWe will go through it and\nwe'll go through it and\n\n119\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.690\ndo the standard sort of\nlearning objectives.\n\n120\n00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.390\nThis is the way we teach today,\nwe identify the students\n\n121\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.470\nlearning objectives and then we'll go\nthrough and, so first here im telling you\n\n122\n00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.650\nwhat im going to teach you, then we'll go\nthrough the modules and I'll teach it.\n\n123\n00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.570\nAnd then ultimately I'll remind you as to\nwhat I've taught you, so that's kind of\n\n124\n00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.600\nthe pattern were going to use\n\n125\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.340\n&gt;&gt; 3 t's yea\n&gt;&gt; Yea\n\n126\n00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.120\n&gt;&gt; And so here is, for example,\n\n127\n00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.500\nsection one.\n\n128\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.160\nAnd at the end of each section, I mean,\nat the end of each unit we're going to\n\n129\n00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.330\ngo through and this is the final slide and\nthe purpose of this final slide is\n\n130\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.275\nI want this content to remain\n&gt;&gt;
