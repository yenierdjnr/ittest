          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.837\n[SOUND] Hey everyone,\nMike Roderick here with ITPRO.TV.\n\n2\n00:00:05.837 --> 00:00:10.381\nAnd I'm here to tell you about a new\nvideo series we've got coming your way,\n\n3\n00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:13.300\nthe CompTIA Cyber Security Analyst Plus.\n\n4\n00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.800\nThe Cyber Security Analyst Plus from\nCompTIA is a vendor neutral certification\n\n5\n00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.610\nthat's really designed to teach us\nthe skills that we'll need to prevent,\n\n6\n00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.950\ndetect, and combat cybersecurity threats.\n\n7\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.140\nSo if you're looking to get into\nthe world of a cybersecurity analyst.\n\n8\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.430\nOr if you've taken your CompTIA Security\nPlus and you're trying to figure out what\n\n9\n00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.530\nthe next step in your certification pass\nshould be, you're in the right place.\n\n10\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.660\nCuz this exam is really designed\nto fill the skills gap between\n\n11\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.610\nthe CompTIA Security Plus and the CompTIA\nAdvanced Security Practitioner exams.\n\n12\n00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.060\nSo let us go out to CompTIA's website and\nsee what we can expect from this exam.\n\n13\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.550\nThis exam again is vendor neutral and\n\n14\n00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.960\nis designed as I said to go\nbetween the Security Plus and\n\n15\n00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.220\nthe Advanced Security Practitioner,\nboth certifications from CompTIA.\n\n16\n00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.450\nWe scroll down a little bit and we will\ntake a look at the details of the exam.\n\n17\n00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.320\nIt is the CS0-001, and it's gonna have\n\n18\n00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.900\nabout 85 questions on the exam,\nmultiple choice and performance-based.\n\n19\n00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.510\nSo we'll get the standard a, b,c,\n\n20\n00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.030\nd questions, as well as a few that\nmight ask us to Do something.\n\n21\n00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.280\nPut some certain steps on a proper order,\n\n22\n00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.160\nthose performance based questions\nthat we can expect from CompTIA.\n\n23\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.800\nThey give you about 165\nminutes to complete the exam.\n\n24\n00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.876\nAnd as the rating is under\nthis passing is a 750.\n\n25\n00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:44.875\nIt's a scale of 100 to 900, we need a 750\nto complete or to pass the certification.\n\n26\n00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:49.734\nThe recommended experience is network\nplus and security plus, they'll tell\n\n27\n00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:54.223\nyou like a lot of these CompTIA exams\nthat there's no real requirement,\n\n28\n00:01:54.223 --> 00:01:59.630\nyou don't have to have your security plus\nfor example to go in and take this exam.\n\n29\n00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.740\nBut this is designed to or\n\n30\n00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.020\nthey're going to assume that you\nalready have that knowledge.\n\n31\n00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.320\nSo you've either taken\nthat certification or\n\n32\n00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.143\nyou've got the real world experience to\nkind of make up for that knowledge base.\n\n33\n00:02:12.143 --> 00:02:16.720\nAll right, $230 here in the US currently,\nthat can always change, so\n\n34\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.517\nmake sure you go check out CompTIA's\nwebsites before you sign up for the exam,\n\n35\n00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:24.714\nfind out what the actual\nprice is in your country, or\n\n36\n00:02:24.714 --> 00:02:28.525\nif they've changed it\nsince we've recorded this.\n\n37\n00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:30.500\nNext, let's look at\nsome of the objectives,\n\n38\n00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.140\nthings we will be covering in\nthis particular video series.\n\n39\n00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.460\nAll right, there you break\nthis down into four domains.\n\n40\n00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.447\nWe've got domain 1 which is\nthreat management, all right.\n\n41\n00:02:42.447 --> 00:02:45.175\n27% of that exam,\n\n42\n00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:49.925\nDomain 2 is gonna be vulnerability\nmanagement, another 26% of our exam.\n\n43\n00:02:49.925 --> 00:02:54.985\nWe got the Cyber Incident Response,\nDomain 3, which is 23% of the exam.\n\n44\n00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:57.995\nAnd then, the Security Architecture and\nTool Sets, Domain 4.\n\n45\n00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:02.335\nIt's gonna worth 21% of the exam.\n\n46\n00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:06.083\nNow, if we scroll down and take a look\nat what those domains break that into,\n\n47\n00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:08.325\nDomain 1 is gonna cover threat management.\n\n48\n00:03:08.325 --> 00:03:12.527\nSo things like, topology discovery,\npack a captured,\n\n49\n00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:17.702\nDNS harvest thing, different variables,\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n50\n00:03:17.702 --> 00:03:20.863\nWired versus wireless networks,\nvirtual versus physical.\n\n51\n00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:25.913\nWe'll take a look at some of the tools\nthat we can use to do network discovery,\n\n52\n00:03:25.913 --> 00:03:29.875\nmapping out our network,\nlocating devices on our network,\n\n53\n00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:33.320\nthen we'll go into analyzing the results,\nright?\n\n54\n00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.250\nOnce we've gathered that information,\nwhat do we do with it?\n\n55\n00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.280\nThat's a very important part.\n\n56\n00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.740\nHow do we filter it down?\n\n57\n00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.420\nFind the important information.\n\n58\n00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.930\nCorrelate logs or cross multiple devices.\n\n59\n00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.180\nWe'll continue on, taking a look\nat the appropriate responses and\n\n60\n00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.960\ncounter measures depending on the threats\nthat we have discovered on our network.\n\n61\n00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.480\nAnd we'll take a look at the purpose and\n\n62\n00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.870\npractices used to secure\na corporate environment.\n\n63\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.760\nDomain 2, we'll get into\nVulnerability Management, right?\n\n64\n00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.660\nWe'll learn what tools are best to use,\nvulnerability scans.\n\n65\n00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.540\nHow often should we do these, and\nthen what do we do with the results that\n\n66\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.510\nwe've obtained from those\nvulnerability scans?\n\n67\n00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.990\nSo analyzing the output,\ncomparing and contrasting different\n\n68\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:22.190\nvulnerabilities found on different types\nof targets within our organisation.\n\n69\n00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.500\nDomain 3 is where we're gonna dive into\nthe world of cyber incident response.\n\n70\n00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.780\nWhat do we do when we've discovered a\nvulnerability has been taken advantage of?\n\n71\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.133\nSomebody's launched an attack\nagainst our systems.\n\n72\n00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:38.928\nHow do we deal with that,\nhow do we go about gathering the evidence,\n\n73\n00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:43.591\nisolating the system from the rest of the\nnetwork, trying to mitigate the impact of\n\n74\n00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:48.340\nthat particular exposure, try to keep it\nfrom spreading to the rest of the network?\n\n75\n00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.900\nAs well as how to collect\nevidence in a way that's\n\n76\n00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.430\ngonna be able to be used in possibly court\nof law, right, if you wanna prosecute.\n\n77\n00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.610\nAnd as we look down here\nforensic investigation,\n\n78\n00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.542\nthis is all about going to the scene\nof the crime, if you will,\n\n79\n00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:09.689\ngathering that evidence, bagging and\ntagging it, and making sure that it can be\n\n80\n00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.860\nused later on if we do tend to prosecute\nwhoever launched the attack, all right.\n\n81\n00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.950\nThe importance of the communication\nprocess during incident response,\n\n82\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.330\nmaking sure that we're not panicking, that\nwe have plans in place for what to do,\n\n83\n00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.940\nthat we're trained up on that and ready\nto proceed with our incident response.\n\n84\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.470\nSummarize the incident recovery in\nthe post-incident response process.\n\n85\n00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.640\nNow that we've dealt with incident,\nwe've got things back to normal,\n\n86\n00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.425\ndo we just go about our\nbusiness like we do everyday?\n\n87\n00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:42.305\nOr do we try to learn\nfrom what we discover,\n\n88\n00:05:42.305 --> 00:05:45.885\nthe way we handle the incident,\nthe way we process the evidence,\n\n89\n00:05:45.885 --> 00:05:50.135\nthe way it went in the court systems,\nwhat we can do better next time, right?\n\n90\n00:05:50.135 --> 00:05:51.950\nWe're always trying to improve.\n\n91\n00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.250\nAnd then we get down into Domain 4 where\nwe start taking a look at a security\n\n92\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.330\narchitecture and the tool sets that\nwe'll need to use or have at our\n\n93\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.510\nready when we're performing this cyber\nsecurity analyst roles within an incident.\n\n94\n00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.720\nSo we'll talk about the different\nframeworks that are available,\n\n95\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.660\ndifferent policies, how to write these\npolicies, how to use policies to make\n\n96\n00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.272\nsure we are implementing our\ncompanies security policies and\n\n97\n00:06:19.272 --> 00:06:23.270\nwhat our best practices and\nprocedures, all right.\n\n98\n00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.970\nSecurity issues related incident,\nand access management.\n\n99\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.870\nTaking their recommendations to implement,\ncompensate, and controls.\n\n100\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.070\nAnd where do we put these controls,\nwhat controls do we put in place?\n\n101\n00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.190\nHow do we side,\nwhich one's we wanna put in place first?\n\n102\n00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.560\nHow do we prioritize amongst those\ndifferent controls that are available?\n\n103\n00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.840\nWe're also going to talk a little bit\nabout the software development life-cycle\n\n104\n00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.170\nand how important it is to make sure\nthat we've got security included\n\n105\n00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.630\nfrom step one in that SDLC.\n\n106\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:59.380\nAnd then lastly we'll take a look at\nthe myriad of tools that are available for\n\n107\n00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.450\nus to use when we're doing our\nrole as a cyber security analyst,\n\n108\n00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.840\nthere are as you can see from the list\nhere there is no shortage of tools.\n\n109\n00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.860\nAnd for this example, pick a few or for\n\n110\n00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.570\nthis video series anyway, we'll pick\na few and we'll demonstrate them.\n\n111\n00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:20.000\nSo, that when you go into the exam,\nwe don't have to know every single tool,\n\n112\n00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.310\nbut we should know what an IPS is\ncapable of and is not capable of.\n\n113\n00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.480\nWhat tools do I have available\nif I need to do packet capture.\n\n114\n00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.430\nIs there just one or\nare there others that I can choose from?\n\n115\n00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.060\nSo we'll go through the list here and\ntalk about the pros and\n\n116\n00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.730\ncons of choosing some of these tools.\n\n117\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.418\nBut don't panic when you\nsee these lists of tools.\n\n118\n00:07:38.418 --> 00:07:43.290\nCompTIA will tell you, this is not to\ntest specific vendor feature sets.\n\n119\n00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.140\nWhat they wanna do is give us an idea\nof the possibilities that we have.\n\n120\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.960\nThere's typically many different\ntools that can do the same job and\n\n121\n00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.520\nwe just need to know that\nthey're available and\n\n122\n00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.770\nwhat their benefits, or pros and cons are\nso we can pick the right ones for the job.\n\n123\n00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.310\nSo we'll look at different\npreventative type tools.\n\n124\n00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:05.010\nWe'll take a look at collecting type\ntools, analytical tools, exploit tools,\n\n125\n00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:09.520\nas well as some forensic tools that we can\nuse if we need to take this, and again,\n\n126\n00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.470\ngo prosecute or\ntake it into the court of law.\n\n127\n00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.540\nSo, if these are some of the skills\nthat you wanna develop, or\n\n128\n00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.870\nif you're looking at taking your\ncertification to the next step, and\n\n129\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.060\npassing the CompTIA, Cyber Security\nAnalyst Plus, this is the series for\n\n130\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.935\nyou, and\nI look forward to seeing you there.\n\n131\n00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:29.444\n[SOUND]\n\n",

series comp CSA plus.\n\n8\n00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.030\nJoining us back in the studios for\n\n9\n00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.380\nthis very endeavors is none other than Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.450\nMike, how are you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.310\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.520\nThanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.444\nI'm glad to be here, and excited,\nbecause we're hitting our environmental\n\n14\n00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:35.730\nreconnaissance in our cyber\nsecurity analyst plus by CompTIA.\n\n15\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.017\nAnd today, we're gonna be looking at what\nthey call environmental reconnaissance.\n\n16\n00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:45.902\nThis is the first time I've seen\nthat term being used, but basically,\n\n17\n00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:50.430\nenvironmental reconnaissance kinda says\neverything we need to know, right?\n\n18\n00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.041\nAnd it means we're gonna look at our\nenvironment, I cannot talk today,\n\n19\n00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:57.190\nwe'll try that again.\n\n20\n00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.913\nNetwork wise, you come in,\nlet's say you're doing a penetration for\n\n21\n00:01:00.913 --> 00:01:02.092\nan organization, and\n\n22\n00:01:02.092 --> 00:01:05.890\nyou're doing a black box test where\nyou know nothing about the network.\n\n23\n00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.467\nRight, you need to do some reconnaissance,\nwhat is in the environment, discover all\n\n24\n00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.880\nthe devices that are out there,\nwhat's hooked up to the network, right?\n\n25\n00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.480\nAs a analyst, or cyber security analyst,\n\n26\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.540\nor as a secured professional for\nyour organization.\n\n27\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.780\nIt's good for\nyou to do these kinds of things,\n\n28\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.130\nto do an environmental reconnaissance\nto see what's out there.\n\n29\n00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.800\nYou probably have a good\nidea what's out there, but\n\n30\n00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.866\nyou'd be surprised how many times you\nget surprised when you start doing this,\n\n31\n00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.943\ndevices that you had no idea were there.\n\n32\n00:01:33.943 --> 00:01:36.452\nThey might have been left from\nthe last guy that was in charge of\n\n33\n00:01:36.452 --> 00:01:37.700\nthe network, or gal.\n\n34\n00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.672\nIt could be that an end user has brought\nsomething in and plugged it in without\n\n35\n00:01:41.672 --> 00:01:45.910\nasking first, could be that a bad guy is\ntrying to get something on your network.\n\n36\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.440\nSo, there’s many different\nreasons that we need to\n\n37\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.210\nperiodically do this kind of recognizance,\neven in our own network.\n\n38\n00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.960\n&gt;&gt; It’s funny you said that,\nin fact, two days ago,\n\n39\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.120\nI had to do that same\nthing to my own network.\n\n40\n00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.140\nI told you I was working all\nweekend on my network, and\n\n41\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.700\nI look into the DHCP client list, and I'm,\nI don't understand what this device is.\n\n42\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.780\nAnd you look at it,\nit's trying to identify the device and\n\n43\n00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.110\nit had an asterisk.\n\n44\n00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.890\nGotta love that.\n\n45\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.220\nSo, I had to hunt down some information\nto figure out what that device was.\n\n46\n00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.842\nFound out it was an old LG phone\nthat my son had turned on and\n\n47\n00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:15.970\nhad joined the network,\nbut you never know.\n\n48\n00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.150\nThat quick, you can have\nsomething on your network, and\n\n49\n00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.020\nwell, it's not supposed to be there.\n\n50\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.610\n&gt;&gt; Users love to plug in a wireless.\n\n51\n00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.090\nYou told them they can't have wireless,\nso they bring one from home,\n\n52\n00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.470\nand slip it under the desk,\nthings like that.\n\n53\n00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.860\nWe do have to be careful,\n\n54\n00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.220\nso, how do we go about discovering\nwhat's on our network, right?\n\n55\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.680\nWe can walk around and\ntry and look, and see, but\n\n56\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.660\nobviously that's not\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n57\n00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.230\nSo, we're gonna use tools that will go\nout, reach out, and explore the network,\n\n58\n00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.500\nbasically using different protocols,\nseeing what response,\n\n59\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.780\nprobing out there looking for\ndevices and then reporting back.\n\n60\n00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.950\nAnd there's several\ndifferent tools you can use.\n\n61\n00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.040\nSolar Winds make some great products.\n\n62\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.230\nMost of those have a free\ntrial associated with them.\n\n63\n00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.490\nWhat's some other ones?\n\n64\n00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.790\nI'm trying to think of some others.\n\n65\n00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.710\nMini Topology Generator, I think was\none that I was taking a look at.\n\n66\n00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.520\nThere's lots of them.\n\n67\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.980\nIf you just go Google\nnetwork topology generator,\n\n68\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.980\nyou'll find lots of different tools.\n\n69\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.810\nWe're gonna be using nMap in here,\nprimarily because it's free.\n\n70\n00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.200\nIt's been around forever, for\na long time, so it's well vetted,\n\n71\n00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.990\nwe know it works, we know it doesn't\nhave any nasty surprises anywhere.\n\n72\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.637\nAnd it's free, right,\nthat's always a good thing, and\n\n73\n00:03:26.637 --> 00:03:28.580\nit'll run on either side of the fence.\n\n74\n00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.190\nIt'll run on Linux, it'll run on Windows.\n\n75\n00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.010\nSo, that's another big advantage there,\ndepending on what you're using for\n\n76\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.250\nyour penetration tabs, for\nyour network analysis, right?\n\n77\n00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.220\nIt was originally written to run on Linux.\n\n78\n00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.360\nIt was ported over to Windows.\n\n79\n00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.830\nWhen you go to download\nMMAP from mmap.org, you\n\n80\n00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.230\ncan download obviously the Linux version,\nyou can download the Windows version.\n\n81\n00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.822\nThe Windows version typically includes\nan additional program called Zenmap,\n\n82\n00:03:57.822 --> 00:04:00.840\nand Zenmap is the GUI interface for Nmap.\n\n83\n00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.490\nN map is actually a command line utility.\n\n84\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.930\nThey've added the GUI for Windows users\nthat aren't too familiar, or don't like\n\n85\n00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.760\nworking from the command prompt, but\nit's a great way to get your feet wet.\n\n86\n00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.740\nIf you're somebody that isn't familiar\nwith working with Linux, isn't familiar\n\n87\n00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.590\nworking from the command line,\nZenmap is actually a great way to go,\n\n88\n00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.570\nbecause I'll show you with that\ngraphical interface, it's check boxes.\n\n89\n00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.160\nI'm filling in fields, I'm checking\ncheck boxes and radio buttons.\n\n90\n00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.380\nAnd then I run it, and not only does it\ngive me the results, just like it would\n\n91\n00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.140\nfrom the command line, but it actually\nshows me the command that it's executing.\n\n92\n00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.920\nSo in the future, if I just want\nto pop open a command prompt and\n\n93\n00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.500\nrun this command,\nI know what it is, right?\n\n94\n00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.090\nSo, I can start writing my own\nlittle scripts, saving these things,\n\n95\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.180\nand maybe even starting to\nautomate some of the process.\n\n96\n00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.760\nSo, play with both of them.\n\n97\n00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.670\nLook at Nmap, Nmap will be called\nout on the exam, most likely.\n\n98\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.970\nBecause it is one of the more common ones,\nand it's freely available.\n\n99\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.710\nThey don't expect you to go out and\nget a license for\n\n100\n00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.825\nSolarWinds in order to pass this exam,\nI hope.\n\n101\n00:05:00.825 --> 00:05:03.770\n[LAUGH] But like I said,\nSolarWinds has some trial programs.\n\n102\n00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.000\nAnd if you're in\nan Enterprise environment,\n\n103\n00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.920\nmaybe you're the one that's responsible\nfor buying the software, or\n\n104\n00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.960\nrecommending what software to use.\n\n105\n00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.550\nYeah, go out and get some of these\ntrial versions, install them.\n\n106\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.190\nSolarWinds is great about giving\nyou full blown versions to try.\n\n107\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.860\nIt's not a limited or a hamstring version.\n\n108\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.870\nYou try it out, see what you think.\n\n109\n00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.190\nAnd then if you wanna keep using it,\nyou can obviously buy a license for it.\n\n110\n00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.210\nAll right, and again, I'm not\nplugging in one particular company.\n\n111\n00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.110\nThere's many, many out there.\n\n112\n00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.800\nLike I do, is use your favorite\nsearch engine, and you can find them.\n\n113\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.600\nSo let's take a look, I,\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n114\n00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.110\nI'm basically only one of my clients,\nCL01 or Client 01.\n\n115\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.780\nAnd I'm gonna pretend that I don't know\nwhat else is out there on my network, so\n\n116\n00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.370\nwe need to discover, we need to do\nour environmental recognizance.\n\n117\n00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.540\nWhat is on my network?\n\n118\n00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.230\nSo, let's start with a graphical version.\n\n119\n00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.170\nI'm gonna go down here and\nclick on my Nmap icon.\n\n120\n00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.730\nAnd this is Zenmap, or\nI should say Zenmap icon.\n\n121\n00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.920\nThis is Zenmap, this is the Windows\nport with the graphical user interface.\n\n122\n00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.810\nAnd on this first screen here, we've got\nour target, we've got a profile, and\n\n123\n00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.810\nwe've got our command itself and\nthen some output areas.\n\n124\n00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.450\nDown below the target,\nthat's what you're trying to scan.\n\n125\n00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.320\nNow, in our case, I don't have\na particular host that I wanna scan.\n\n126\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.110\nI wanna scan the entire network.\n\n127\n00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.000\nSo, I'm gonna put in a network address.\n\n128\n00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.690\nYou can list individual IP addresses,\nyou have a list of IP addresses,\n\n129\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.020\nyou can do entire networks.\n\n130\n00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:38.921\nFor me, I'm going to do 10.0.100.0/24,\n\n131\n00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:43.600\njust to limit my results to my\nlittle virtual environment here.\n\n132\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.990\nSo, I don't need to scan\nthe entire ITPRO.TV network.\n\n133\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.830\nAnd then for the profile,\nthey've got a few built in.\n\n134\n00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.550\nI'll show you how to create\nthese in just a second.\n\n135\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.260\nI'm just going to leave it on intense\nscan, and then right below that,\n\n136\n00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.530\nyou can now see my command, nmap-T,\n\n137\n00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.830\nanother thing about Nmap,\nthe commands are case sensitive.\n\n138\n00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.740\nSo, if I do move to the command prompt,\n\n139\n00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.740\ngot to make sure that I\nremember that's a capital T.\n\n140\n00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.030\nT for timing.\n\n141\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.600\nThere's one through five, one being\nthe slowest, five being the fastest.\n\n142\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.530\nWhile I choose one of the other, depends\non how stealthy you're trying to be.\n\n143\n00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.860\nAnd if I do a four or five,\nI'm gonna get the scan done quickly.\n\n144\n00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.090\nIf I got a large number\nof devices to scan,\n\n145\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.990\nthen I probably want to\nput it on a four or five.\n\n146\n00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.840\nBut it's gonna be noisy, in other words,\nany intrusion, detection devices,\n\n147\n00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.390\nintrusion prevention devices,\ncould very well and\n\n148\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.710\nmost likely will pick up that scan.\n\n149\n00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.440\nAnd if configured to do so,\nwe'll generate an alert,\n\n150\n00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.440\nletting somebody know that\nthis scan is going on.\n\n151\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.382\nSo, if I'm doing a pen test, and\nI need to be stealthy about it,\n\n152\n00:07:47.382 --> 00:07:49.720\nI might drop that down to a two or a one.\n\n153\n00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.704\nThat just means it's gonna put more time\nin between the probes it sends out, so\n\n154\n00:07:54.704 --> 00:07:59.538\nthat maybe these intrusion protection\nsystems will see them as one string of\n\n155\n00:07:59.538 --> 00:08:00.837\n1,000 pings.\n\n156\n00:08:00.837 --> 00:08:02.275\nRight, they're kind of spaced out.\n\n157\n00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:03.761\nOther traffic's gonna be occurring.\n\n158\n00:08:03.761 --> 00:08:05.270\nMaybe they don't notice,\n\n159\n00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.680\nthat's the idea anyway is trying to\nbe a little stealthier, all right?\n\n160\n00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.170\nBut if you have host-based\nintrusion detection,\n\n161\n00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.870\nit definitely could pick this up.\n\n162\n00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.500\nSo you have to play around\nwith those options again,\n\n163\n00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.055\ndepending on what you're trying to do.\n\n164\n00:08:18.055 --> 00:08:23.590\nThe capital\n\n165\n00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.450\nA gives me an OS version\ninformation as well as,\n\n166\n00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.160\nor what we call OS Fingerprinting\nwhich we'll talk about in a second.\n\n167\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.510\nIt also gives me a version information\nabout what's found on each port and\n\n168\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.580\nit's gonna give me,\nwhat else does it thrown in there?\n\n169\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.090\nTrace route information\npath to the device.\n\n170\n00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.320\nBut honestly, for me, at this point\nI don't know what's out there and\n\n171\n00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.220\nI don't necessarily wanna do intense scans\non every single device out there just yet.\n\n172\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.510\nRight now, I really just wanna see what's\navailable, what's out there on my network.\n\n173\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.562\nSo I'm gonna change this up.\n\n174\n00:09:00.562 --> 00:09:03.365\nEven though I chose that\nprofile intense scan,\n\n175\n00:09:03.365 --> 00:09:08.330\nthere's nothing saying that I cannot\ncome over here and modify this command.\n\n176\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.597\nI could even save it as another profile so\nI can turn around and\n\n177\n00:09:11.597 --> 00:09:13.890\nfire it off again any time I want.\n\n178\n00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.570\nSo let's just do a dash s.\n\n179\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:21.630\nIt's a little s for scan type and then\ncapital P, no space, little s, capital P.\n\n180\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.193\nSo -sP.\n\n181\n00:09:23.193 --> 00:09:25.926\nThat's basically gonna be\ndoing a ping sweep, right?\n\n182\n00:09:25.926 --> 00:09:30.406\nScan type P for ping,\nyou could do a scan type T, capital T, for\n\n183\n00:09:30.406 --> 00:09:34.790\nTCP, you can do UDP,\nyou can do different types of scans.\n\n184\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.586\nIn my case, I'm just gonna do a ping\nsweep, which should just tell me, hey,\n\n185\n00:09:37.586 --> 00:09:39.452\nare they responding,\nis there actually a device?\n\n186\n00:09:39.452 --> 00:09:44.498\nCuz in my case, I'm doing a /24,\nso on that 10.100,\n\n187\n00:09:44.498 --> 00:09:48.131\nthere's 254 addresses that I could use.\n\n188\n00:09:48.131 --> 00:09:53.070\nReally 255, but Nmap doesn't\ncare about the first and last.\n\n189\n00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.647\nSo at this point,\nI don't need it to take a lot of time.\n\n190\n00:09:56.647 --> 00:09:59.549\nI'm not doing a port scan on every post.\n\n191\n00:09:59.549 --> 00:10:01.871\nI know that there's only three or\nfour hosts on here.\n\n192\n00:10:01.871 --> 00:10:03.717\nBut let's say you didn't know and\n\n193\n00:10:03.717 --> 00:10:07.289\nyour first scan was to do\na complete port scan of all 65,000.\n\n194\n00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:09.387\nWell, what about all those hosts\nthat aren't responding, right?\n\n195\n00:10:09.387 --> 00:10:12.726\nThere's no point in even trying to talk\nto them, waiting for them to fail,\n\n196\n00:10:12.726 --> 00:10:15.760\nrealizing it's not up, and\nthen moving on to the next one.\n\n197\n00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.610\nFirst gets you a list of live hosts.\n\n198\n00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.160\nSo that's what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit scan.\n\n199\n00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.709\nAnd it's gonna fire it up,\nit's gonna start it off.\n\n200\n00:10:24.709 --> 00:10:28.737\nAnd in just a minute, we should\nget some results, and there we go.\n\n201\n00:10:28.737 --> 00:10:30.903\nAll right, let me zoom in real quick so\n\n202\n00:10:30.903 --> 00:10:34.967\nyou can see where it says starting mmap\nand it gives me the scan report for\n\n203\n00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:39.470\neach one of those IP addresses that\nit found, and just basic information.\n\n204\n00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.640\nI see a MAC address, and it says, that's\nan Intel based on the first six, right?\n\n205\n00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.429\nOn the, what was that called, Wes?\n\n206\n00:10:45.429 --> 00:10:49.855\n&gt;&gt; The OUI, that's the Organizationally\nUnique Identifier, if I can get it right.\n\n207\n00:10:49.855 --> 00:10:51.150\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n208\n00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:56.050\nSo that tells me that Intel has been\nassigned those first six digits there.\n\n209\n00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.280\nThat must be an Intel network adaptor.\n\n210\n00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.039\nBelow that,\nI can see 100.102.200.201.100, and\n\n211\n00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:08.020\nthose guys are all running\nvirtual network adapters there.\n\n212\n00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.130\nSo it just sees them as Microsoft.\n\n213\n00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.591\nBut anyway, the point is I found\nout that out of the 256 addresses,\n\n214\n00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.869\nthere's only five hosts, right?\n\n215\n00:11:16.869 --> 00:11:20.207\nSo now I can start\nlimiting my scans maybe,\n\n216\n00:11:20.207 --> 00:11:25.601\nto a particular range of addresses,\nI could do 99 through 201.\n\n217\n00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:29.240\nOr I could even start listing\nout individual addresses, or\n\n218\n00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.950\nwe can feed it a list.\n\n219\n00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.700\nThat's another thing about\nNmap is you can do a -iL, and\n\n220\n00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.940\nyou can use a list of IP addresses for\nexample that you wanna scan.\n\n221\n00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.530\nWhich I'm gonna show you on the Linux side\nhow to create a list of just IP addresses\n\n222\n00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.080\nthat you can then turn around and use.\n\n223\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.480\nWhen I'm doing a penetration test and\n\n224\n00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.380\nI don't know the network, I scan all 256\naddresses, see which ones are up or not.\n\n225\n00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.620\nBut then the next thing I do is I\ntake that and I use grep in the Linux\n\n226\n00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.636\nworld to filter that down to\njust showing me the live hosts.\n\n227\n00:11:58.636 --> 00:12:02.660\nAnd then filter down even more to just\nshow the IP address of those live hosts.\n\n228\n00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.526\nNow all of a sudden, I've got a text\nfile that has just IP addresses,\n\n229\n00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:10.206\none on each line, and I can use that\nas the input for my next sweep.\n\n230\n00:12:10.206 --> 00:12:13.933\nMaybe I'm gonna do a tcp scan, but I can\ntell it just these IP address, all right?\n\n231\n00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:15.613\nSo very, very cool.\n\n232\n00:12:15.613 --> 00:12:17.880\nAll right, so let's get back out here.\n\n233\n00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.240\nOther information I can see, you can see\nthe different hosts listed over here.\n\n234\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.238\nAnd as I go to the ports,\nwe should be able to see some of that\n\n235\n00:12:26.238 --> 00:12:31.310\ninformation or services,\nit's not liking that.\n\n236\n00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.192\nSo it's showing me again\nthe host server here.\n\n237\n00:12:33.192 --> 00:12:40.306\nI can also see a topology map, and\na topology map, if I can remember.\n\n238\n00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:42.000\nLet me try to zoom in a little bit.\n\n239\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.314\nLet's just change this guy, oops.\n\n240\n00:12:47.076 --> 00:12:48.940\nThat's not what I wanted either.\n\n241\n00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.720\nWhere is, controls, there we go.\n\n242\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.270\nThey keep moving that around.\n\n243\n00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.210\nUsing those controls,\nI can change the zoom on this\n\n244\n00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.520\ncuz I've got such a small network I\nreally don't need all of that space.\n\n245\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.680\nIt's still zooming, there we go.\n\n246\n00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.145\nThere you can see the local host is\nobviously where I'm sitting at, and\n\n247\n00:13:09.145 --> 00:13:11.648\nthen these are the other\ndevices that it's found.\n\n248\n00:13:11.648 --> 00:13:14.872\nI can click on one of those and\nget that to the center,\n\n249\n00:13:14.872 --> 00:13:17.080\nI can take a look at the Nmap output.\n\n250\n00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.310\nLet me go back over to that map.\n\n251\n00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.410\nI can right-click and\nchoose ports and host.\n\n252\n00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:27.448\nBut again, because I only did a ping\nsweep, there's no other information.\n\n253\n00:13:27.448 --> 00:13:30.115\nWhen I click on one of these host,\nI don't see any information.\n\n254\n00:13:30.115 --> 00:13:33.110\nYou might be thinking, well,\nwhat happened, something broke?\n\n255\n00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.100\nRemember, all I did was a ping sweep.\n\n256\n00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.808\nSo it didn't check every single port, and\n\n257\n00:13:36.808 --> 00:13:38.616\nit's not showing me what was open or\nclosed.\n\n258\n00:13:38.616 --> 00:13:41.258\nIt's just saying, hey,\nthis guy responded to a ping packet.\n\n259\n00:13:41.258 --> 00:13:44.638\nSo at this point the information I\nhave is rather limited, but again,\n\n260\n00:13:44.638 --> 00:13:46.599\nthat’s the way we typically do things.\n\n261\n00:13:46.599 --> 00:13:50.461\nWe wanna start out by just\nfiguring out what's out there.\n\n262\n00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:54.950\nOnce we've figured out what’s out there,\nthen we can pick our targets a little\n\n263\n00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.840\nmore carefully and start doing more\nintense scans on those, right?\n\n264\n00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.070\nAll right,\nwhat else here can we take a look at?\n\n265\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.493\nI guess that's good for this for now.\n\n266\n00:14:06.493 --> 00:14:07.340\nSo that's Nmap.\n\n267\n00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.807\nLet's take a look at the command\nline version of that.\n\n268\n00:14:10.807 --> 00:14:14.936\nWe can take this command right here and\n\n269\n00:14:14.936 --> 00:14:19.582\ncopy it and\nI can fire up a command prompt and\n\n270\n00:14:19.582 --> 00:14:23.597\nI can paste that command in, maybe.\n\n271\n00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:24.908\nThere we go.\n\n272\n00:14:24.908 --> 00:14:27.470\nHit Enter, and\nyou'll see it runs just fine.\n\n273\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.450\nNow it's gonna put the output\nhere in the command prompt window\n\n274\n00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.550\nrather than in my little GUI interface.\n\n275\n00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.140\nBut I wanna save this as a file.\n\n276\n00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.950\nThere's a couple of ways you can do it.\n\n277\n00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.134\nEasiest way is just to use your greater\nthan symbol and give it a path, right?\n\n278\n00:14:40.134 --> 00:14:43.984\nC:/users\n\n279\n00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:53.984\n/mike.lab/documents/firstscan.txt.\n\n280\n00:14:59.387 --> 00:15:01.070\nIt's gonna run the exact same scan, but\n\n281\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.500\nthere's not gonna be any\noutput on my screen.\n\n282\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.670\nSo now if I open that file up,\n\n283\n00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:14.950\ntake a look at my documents, and\nwe just get a little notepad for now.\n\n284\n00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.040\nAnd you can see that information.\n\n285\n00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.440\nSo, if I need a hard copy,\nif I wanna save the information,\n\n286\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.740\nwhich typically I do,\nespecially if you're doing a pen test.\n\n287\n00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.370\nYou might need this for\nyour final documentation.\n\n288\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.792\nIf you're doing it for, as a security\nanalyst for your own company,\n\n289\n00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:30.804\nyou need to document what you've found so\nthat you can kinda create a baseline and\n\n290\n00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:34.293\nthen next week, next month when\nyou do this again, what's changed?\n\n291\n00:15:34.293 --> 00:15:35.325\nWhat's different?\n\n292\n00:15:35.325 --> 00:15:39.380\nAll right, so I like using Nmap.\n\n293\n00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.340\nIt's a great utility.\n\n294\n00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.445\nLike I said, been around for a long time.\n\n295\n00:15:43.445 --> 00:15:46.020\nProfilewise, all right,\n\n296\n00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:52.140\nyou can go up here to the Profile menu and\nchoose New Profile or Command.\n\n297\n00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.378\nAnd here is where you can spend\na little time creating a new profile.\n\n298\n00:15:56.378 --> 00:16:00.910\nSo I'll call this one Lab A or\nsomething, we'll just give it a name.\n\n299\n00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.097\nAnd I can go through these different tabs.\n\n300\n00:16:03.097 --> 00:16:03.697\nAnd I can choose.\n\n301\n00:16:03.697 --> 00:16:06.759\nI'll zoom in, but\nI can't really click while I'm zoomed in.\n\n302\n00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:08.330\nSo, you can see some of the options.\n\n303\n00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:14.290\nTarget, you want to do a TCP scan, timing,\nI've got some version information.\n\n304\n00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:18.410\nAll these are just little check marks that\nI can select to include in my commands.\n\n305\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.250\nSo let me zoom back out, and\nlet's say we want to do,\n\n306\n00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.120\nwe want to do the operating\nsystem detection.\n\n307\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.290\nAnd I want to do a version information.\n\n308\n00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.430\nIt's going to be a TCP syn scan,\nor we'll do a connect scan.\n\n309\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.529\nAnd I'll just kind of keep\ngoing through these tabs.\n\n310\n00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:39.439\nDo I want to include ping information?\n\n311\n00:16:39.439 --> 00:16:42.400\nLet's do an ICMP ping.\n\n312\n00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.450\nScripting, Nmap has its own\nscripting language, and\n\n313\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.150\nit has its own scripting engine,\nthe NSE, or the Nmap Scripting Engine.\n\n314\n00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.120\nAnd there are, as you can see,\nlook how big my scroll bar is there.\n\n315\n00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:01.540\nThere are a ton of built in scripts that\nyou can use, and these are fantastic.\n\n316\n00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.660\nLet me just tell you, you gotta play\naround with some of these scripts,\n\n317\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:09.130\nbecause you can get a lot more\ninformation, I'm using that for years\n\n318\n00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:14.240\nbefore I realized the scripts were there,\nand I was like, wow, look at all of these.\n\n319\n00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.060\nCuz they'll hit things like SNB and\n\n320\n00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.560\npull back information that you\ndidn't even know it was available.\n\n321\n00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.780\n&gt;&gt; You've said you used that utility there\nfor years before you realized the script.\n\n322\n00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.510\nLet me save our viewers\na little bit of hassle.\n\n323\n00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.580\nLet's say Mike, I'm not really\nthat good in the command prompt.\n\n324\n00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.900\nMaybe I'm not familiar with it, and some\nof the command stuff you're talking about,\n\n325\n00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.070\nI know the first time I opened\na command prompt learning,\n\n326\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.160\nit gave me chills down my spine.\n\n327\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.140\nCan they use a lot of the options that\nwe're seeing digging through here, and\n\n328\n00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.040\nthen just kinda learn it that way,\nif I don't know the switches,\n\n329\n00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.370\nI don't what they do?\n\n330\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.350\nI just might mark them down there,\nand then keep an eye on what they are.\n\n331\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:51.660\nAnd if I want, just convert and\njust maybe even do a copy-cut-paste.\n\n332\n00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.190\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yes and no.\n\n333\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.130\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Let's say yes and no.\n\n334\n00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:57.179\nSo, all the stuff I'm\nchoosing on these tabs.\n\n335\n00:17:57.179 --> 00:17:58.587\nYes, it's gonna show up in the command.\n\n336\n00:17:58.587 --> 00:18:02.216\nIn fact, as you can see it,\nbuilding the command as we go.\n\n337\n00:18:02.216 --> 00:18:03.093\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yep.\n\n338\n00:18:03.093 --> 00:18:08.581\n&gt;&gt; -Sn -sT for my tcp -sV for\nmy versioning, -O for my operating system\n\n339\n00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:15.180\ndetection or fingerprinting, -PE to do\nthat ICMP I think is what it shows.\n\n340\n00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.810\nYeah, ICMV ping, and then my address,\nand as I click on other things,\n\n341\n00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:24.720\nlet's go to, let's say target,\nwhat could I actually click on?\n\n342\n00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.910\nLet's do timing, let's set the timing\nto max time to scan the target or,\n\n343\n00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:34.470\nwe don't want to do any one of those.\n\n344\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:39.050\nLet's do an aggressive, I'm trying to\nthink what else I actually want to add.\n\n345\n00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.550\nLet's add some IPv6 support.\n\n346\n00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.200\nAnd you see that -6 that\njust popped up there.\n\n347\n00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.390\nSo, as I choose these options,\nthey're gonna build that command.\n\n348\n00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.830\nThe script, however,\nis a little bit different.\n\n349\n00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:53.340\nScripts are pre-written blocks of\ncode that NMAP can read and execute.\n\n350\n00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.350\nWe just have to choose to include them.\n\n351\n00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:00.080\nYou do a --script, and watch what\nhappens when I choose one of these guys.\n\n352\n00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.760\nLet me find my, let's do some SMB,\n\n353\n00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.820\nusers or maybe,\nlike these SMPT vulnerability scan.\n\n354\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.020\nI can actually use Nmap\nto scan my network,\n\n355\n00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.939\nto see if there's anybody\nvulnerable to CVE-2010-43, right?\n\n356\n00:19:18.939 --> 00:19:21.020\nRight, there's a pre-built script for\nthat.\n\n357\n00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.780\nI don't have to figure out what to do and\nhow to do it.\n\n358\n00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:28.430\nSo, a lot of great stuff in here,\nSMB vulnerabilities.\n\n359\n00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.780\nAgain, those aren't really designed to\nscan your network just to get information.\n\n360\n00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.080\nThat's when, okay, I know what I've got.\n\n361\n00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.830\nI wanna scan, and\nI wanna see am I vulnerable.\n\n362\n00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.230\nOr if I'm a bad guy,\n\n363\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.490\nthis is what I use to find your one server\nthat you didn't patch against this.\n\n364\n00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:46.210\nNow, I know it's vulnerable,\nI can launch an attack against it, right?\n\n365\n00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:51.490\nWe'll just to SMB, I don't know,\nsystem info, right, just to show you.\n\n366\n00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.200\nSo now if I look at my command that\nis building, see that --script,\n\n367\n00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.010\nand then the name of the script,\nsnb-system-info.\n\n368\n00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.420\nSo it's telling you hey,\nrun this script as you're doing the scan.\n\n369\n00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.620\nSo now what's it's gonna\ndo it's each IP address,\n\n370\n00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.321\nit's gonna do whatever scan I've chosen,\nin this case, TCP.\n\n371\n00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:10.302\nBut this is also gonna run this\nscript against that target and\n\n372\n00:20:10.302 --> 00:20:12.650\npull back information,\nbased on what script.\n\n373\n00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.770\nSo, you can choose multiple\nscripts if you want.\n\n374\n00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.220\nSome scripts require arguments.\n\n375\n00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.259\nSo, when a script requires an argument,\n\n376\n00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:22.367\nyou'll see they'll be able to\ntype in information over here.\n\n377\n00:20:22.367 --> 00:20:24.349\nNow I'll go ahead and save these changes.\n\n378\n00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.830\nAll right, and now,\nin my profile list, I should have,\n\n379\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.630\nthere is lab a, and I can run the scan.\n\n380\n00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:38.532\nNow, I don't actually want to run,\nwhat the heck, why we got four host here?\n\n381\n00:20:38.532 --> 00:20:39.248\n&gt;&gt; In fact, you know what?\n\n382\n00:20:39.248 --> 00:20:40.440\nYeah, let's go ahead and run it.\n\n383\n00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.809\nWe'll just let it run while we're\nfinishing up our conversation here.\n\n384\n00:20:44.852 --> 00:20:47.752\nThat says keep ports scanner above\nwith any of this scan types.\n\n385\n00:20:47.752 --> 00:20:51.801\nIt didn't like my SN, so, cuz I did\nthat before, so let's take that out.\n\n386\n00:20:54.873 --> 00:20:58.133\nThink that was telling you to do\na no scan, skip port scan, and\n\n387\n00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:01.772\nright after that,\nI've got to tell it do a TCP connect scan.\n\n388\n00:21:01.772 --> 00:21:04.360\nSo, that's obviously not going to work, so\n\n389\n00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.350\nwe'll run that scan again,\nsee what happens.\n\n390\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.440\nBut now at this point,\nI need to modify my profile,\n\n391\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.600\nbecause my profile\nincludes that bad switch.\n\n392\n00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.650\nBut the point is,\n\n393\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:16.980\nyou can start to learn the Nmap\ncommands by using this GUI interface.\n\n394\n00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.540\nAnd then you can, as Wes said,\nslowly either write these down,\n\n395\n00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.620\ncopy them out to a text file,\nwhatever you want to do.\n\n396\n00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:28.830\nAnd then, you can, again,\nstart to learn those commands.\n\n397\n00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.600\nNow, I know we're getting\na little short on time, so\n\n398\n00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.280\nlet me do a couple more things.\n\n399\n00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.890\nI wanna do the operating system version.\n\n400\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.640\nLet's switch over to the command line for\nthis.\n\n401\n00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.650\nI will use Nmap from\nthe command line here.\n\n402\n00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:47.910\nAnd let's do an Nmap -O, and\nI'll take one of those addresses\n\n403\n00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:53.350\nthat were in my results 100.200,\nthen I'll hit Enter, all right.\n\n404\n00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.904\nRight, you can also add a -v for\nverbose to get additional information,\n\n405\n00:21:58.904 --> 00:22:02.700\nto give it a little more, or\nmake it a little more verbose.\n\n406\n00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:08.224\nAnd here we can see the results, I can see\nall the ports that are open on this guy.\n\n407\n00:22:08.224 --> 00:22:13.338\nAnd then right below that, we'll see\naggressive OS guesses, and it's coming\n\n408\n00:22:13.338 --> 00:22:18.677\nup with multiple guesses, actually,\nnone of them are, it doesn't say just one,\n\n409\n00:22:18.677 --> 00:22:24.056\nbut all of them look to be Windows based,\nit does say test conditions are not ideal.\n\n410\n00:22:24.056 --> 00:22:27.650\nWhen it's doing this OS guessing,\nit's basing it on a lot of information,\n\n411\n00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.470\nhow the server's responding,\nor whatever the target is.\n\n412\n00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:34.700\nHow it's responding to open ports, versus\nresponding to closed ports' requests.\n\n413\n00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.670\nSMB information can be used, depending\non what type of scan we're using.\n\n414\n00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.440\nSo, this one, in this case, it's guessing.\n\n415\n00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.530\nIt says, I think it's Windows, and\nit looks like it's one of the servers.\n\n416\n00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.000\nBut it also lists most of\nthe clients it looks like, as well.\n\n417\n00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.150\nSo, it's not real close, right?\n\n418\n00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.170\nAt least it knows it Windows.\n\n419\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.480\nWe're in the ballpark.\n\n420\n00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.530\nThere are some other switches that you can\nuse to make it a little more aggressive\n\n421\n00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.390\nwith the OS detection.\n\n422\n00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.670\nWhy do I wanna detect the OS?\n\n423\n00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.760\nWell, because now I know what\nit might be vulnerable to.\n\n424\n00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.527\nAnd if I know that it's a Server 2012\nR2 operating system, I can go search my\n\n425\n00:23:08.527 --> 00:23:13.030\nexploit database, and I can find\nan exploit that it might be vulnerable to.\n\n426\n00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.990\nOr as the pen tester,\nI need to discover this information,\n\n427\n00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.700\nagain, so I know what to\ntest against those machines.\n\n428\n00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.830\nAll right, couple of other ones,\nI'll show, it's another one.\n\n429\n00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:29.820\nIf we change this O, remember O is\noperating system, OS fingerprinting.\n\n430\n00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.160\nRemember that term,\nthey'll call it out on the exam.\n\n431\n00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.720\nOS fingerprinting means\nI'm trying to determine\n\n432\n00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.210\nwhat the operating system\nis on a remote machine.\n\n433\n00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.700\nIf I do a capital A,\nthat is OS fingerprinting,\n\n434\n00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:46.250\nas well as version information, and\nsome traceroute information, right?\n\n435\n00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.610\nYou can see in the results\nof this first one,\n\n436\n00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.290\nI can see the services that\nare running on the different ports.\n\n437\n00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:55.942\nWatch the results here when I run this\ncommand, see what the difference is.\n\n438\n00:23:55.942 --> 00:23:58.651\nI switched the capital O to a capital A.\n\n439\n00:24:01.008 --> 00:24:03.740\nAnd we'll let that complete.\n\n440\n00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.110\nShouldn't take too long,\nit's just one machine.\n\n441\n00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.280\nAnd again, we can start doing, well,\n\n442\n00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.648\nI'll show you a couple more\nhere in just a second.\n\n443\n00:24:13.648 --> 00:24:15.640\nAll right, now, when you do the version,\nas you can see,\n\n444\n00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.106\nit's taking a little more time, right?\n\n445\n00:24:17.106 --> 00:24:21.100\nBecause it's gotta go through, and not\nonly is it seeing what ports are open, but\n\n446\n00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:25.850\nnow it's doing banner grabbing on those\nports and it's trying to figure out, okay,\n\n447\n00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.990\nI see you're running, I don't know, IIS.\n\n448\n00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.380\nBut what version of IIS?\n\n449\n00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.076\nIs that IIS 7?\n\n450\n00:24:32.076 --> 00:24:33.717\nIs that IIS 9?\n\n451\n00:24:33.717 --> 00:24:37.600\nWhich version of Apache or\nPHP is running on that machine?\n\n452\n00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.890\nWhy is that important?\n\n453\n00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:44.224\nBecause now version 9 of IIS was\npatched against this vulnerability.\n\n454\n00:24:44.224 --> 00:24:46.294\nSo if it's version 9,\nI can't use this exploit.\n\n455\n00:24:46.294 --> 00:24:50.240\nBut if it's version 7,\nthis exploit's definitely in the ballpark,\n\n456\n00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.050\nand now maybe I can try to run that.\n\n457\n00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:57.410\nSo that's why I wanna know what version\nthat is running on those different ports.\n\n458\n00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.104\nAnd you find that, unfortunately,\npeople don't update.\n\n459\n00:25:00.104 --> 00:25:04.924\nOr if I am, I need to see, I need to\ngo talk to my dev guy, I realized that,\n\n460\n00:25:04.924 --> 00:25:09.485\nhey, they're still running IIS 7 on\none of our platforms, all right.\n\n461\n00:25:09.485 --> 00:25:11.394\nMight not have known that\nunless I had run this scan.\n\n462\n00:25:11.394 --> 00:25:14.060\nAll right, it is taking its sweet time.\n\n463\n00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.269\nSo while it's doing that,\nwe'll come back and check on it.\n\n464\n00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:18.054\nI know as soon I switch away,\nit's gonna pop up.\n\n465\n00:25:18.054 --> 00:25:22.900\nBut I do wanna show you a little bit\non the Linux side of things as well.\n\n466\n00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.350\nSo let's take a look at this guy,\nthis is Kali Linux.\n\n467\n00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.713\nAnd I'm gonna open up a prompt.\n\n468\n00:25:30.713 --> 00:25:34.980\nAll versions of Linux, there's many,\nmany distributions, flavors.\n\n469\n00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:39.090\nI chose Kali only because it has\na lot of the tools preinstalled,\n\n470\n00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.400\nwhich makes life a whole lot easier.\n\n471\n00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.790\nIf you need help with Nmap, Windows or\n\n472\n00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.030\nKali or Linux,\nyou can just type the word Nmap and\n\n473\n00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:51.730\nhit Enter, and here's a list of all\nthe different switches and some scripts.\n\n474\n00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.490\nIf you go out to nmap.org and\n\n475\n00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.700\nyou look at the documentation,\ngreat set of documentation.\n\n476\n00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.240\nLots of information there to tell you\nabout the different options, how to run\n\n477\n00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.160\nscripts, how to use the arguments with\nthose scripts, and things like that.\n\n478\n00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.681\nSo let me clear this.\n\n479\n00:26:06.681 --> 00:26:08.384\nOops, this is not Windows, Michael.\n\n480\n00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:12.580\nAnd let's try another one.\n\n481\n00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.710\nLet's do an Nmap.\n\n482\n00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:19.722\nLet's do just a dash,\nlet's do a pink sweep.\n\n483\n00:26:19.722 --> 00:26:21.001\nWe'll do a little sp.\n\n484\n00:26:21.001 --> 00:26:27.726\nAnd that same network, 10.0.100.0/24.\n\n485\n00:26:27.726 --> 00:26:31.199\nThis time, I'll go ahead and run it,\njust so you see what it looks like.\n\n486\n00:26:33.575 --> 00:26:36.830\nAll right, and we'll let that go.\n\n487\n00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.230\nAnd same information that I saw\non the Windows side of things.\n\n488\n00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.210\nNo different, right,\nwhich is not surprising.\n\n489\n00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.970\nI can see what hosts are up.\n\n490\n00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:47.820\nNow, what I wanna try to\ndo is save this to a file.\n\n491\n00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.540\nAnd so I'm going to run that same command.\n\n492\n00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.708\nActually, let me get us\na little space in here so\n\n493\n00:26:53.708 --> 00:26:56.523\nwe can see what we're doing, there we go.\n\n494\n00:26:56.523 --> 00:26:57.834\nI'm gonna run that command again.\n\n495\n00:26:57.834 --> 00:27:01.481\nBut this time I'm gonna add a -oG.\n\n496\n00:27:01.481 --> 00:27:06.898\nNow, there's several\ndifferent outputs you can do.\n\n497\n00:27:06.898 --> 00:27:10.540\nLittle o for output,\ng for grepable output.\n\n498\n00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.452\nBut you can also do XML which is an x,\n\n499\n00:27:14.452 --> 00:27:18.920\n-oN for normal output,\nlike if you're doing to a text file.\n\n500\n00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.830\nSo there's several different\noutputs you can do.\n\n501\n00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:25.310\nIn fact, you can see those listed\nhere in the output area, all right.\n\n502\n00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:31.882\nAnd I'm going to say output grepable,\nand let's do this to, where am I?\n\n503\n00:27:31.882 --> 00:27:34.068\nI didn't change directories first.\n\n504\n00:27:34.068 --> 00:27:35.119\nLet's do.\n\n505\n00:27:42.821 --> 00:27:44.507\nDocuments, I'll just dump\nit in my documents folder.\n\n506\n00:27:44.507 --> 00:27:51.079\nAnd let's call it list or scan.txt.\n\n507\n00:27:54.614 --> 00:27:58.385\nAll right, and\nthen let's go check that out.\n\n508\n00:27:58.385 --> 00:28:02.906\nWe'll do a cd /documents, oops, and\n\n509\n00:28:02.906 --> 00:28:08.662\nwe'll look for,\nwhat did I call it, scan.txt.\n\n510\n00:28:08.662 --> 00:28:10.760\nDid I not dump it there?\n\n511\n00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.250\nAnd evidently, that's not where I put it.\n\n512\n00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.458\nYou can tell I'm a big, big.\n\n513\n00:28:16.458 --> 00:28:18.644\nThere it is, okay, so let's scan.\n\n514\n00:28:18.644 --> 00:28:24.177\nSo let's do a cat scan.txt.\n\n515\n00:28:24.177 --> 00:28:27.370\nAnd there's the output of that file.\n\n516\n00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.270\nSo we could go double-click on that file,\nobviously, and open it up.\n\n517\n00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.530\nBut here's the file itself.\n\n518\n00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:35.320\nNow, one of the cool things I said\nabout Nmap is that you can use a list\n\n519\n00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.190\nas a source of IP addresses.\n\n520\n00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:43.180\nRather than trying to type them in\nup there, we can create a list and\n\n521\n00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.600\nuse that as the input.\n\n522\n00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.630\nBut the problem is this list\nhas these lines like Nmap,\n\n523\n00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:52.450\nthere's the scan I ran,\nthere's the result information, a summary.\n\n524\n00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.660\nReally what I want is just\nthese IP addresses, all right?\n\n525\n00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:00.860\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try\nto figure out a way to trim this down.\n\n526\n00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:04.490\nThis is not a Linux class, I wouldn't\nbe the one to teach it if it was.\n\n527\n00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:08.311\nBut I am gonna show you\nthat I can take this and\n\n528\n00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:12.142\ndo a little grep for\nhost colon, all right?\n\n529\n00:29:12.142 --> 00:29:13.612\nAnd I'll put my quotes.\n\n530\n00:29:13.612 --> 00:29:16.280\nBasically, grep is saying,\nlook through this file for\n\n531\n00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.250\na line that has the word host in it,\nhost colon.\n\n532\n00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:23.310\nAnd I'm going to pipe that out, or\nactually I'm gonna send that to a file.\n\n533\n00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:27.488\nWe'll call this livehost.txt.\n\n534\n00:29:27.488 --> 00:29:33.564\nAnd then we're gonna pipe that out to,\nyou know what?\n\n535\n00:29:33.564 --> 00:29:34.460\nI did that wrong.\n\n536\n00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.230\nI gotta do my, this is my source file.\n\n537\n00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.850\nSo that file is called scan.txt.\n\n538\n00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.045\nThat we're going to pipe\ninto a cut command.\n\n539\n00:29:43.045 --> 00:29:46.818\ncut -d, gotta spell it right.\n\n540\n00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:50.800\ncut -d, and that's what the delimiter is.\n\n541\n00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.032\nAnd I'm gonna do a space inside quotes,\ncuz if I look,\n\n542\n00:29:54.032 --> 00:29:56.156\nwhat's dividing my information?\n\n543\n00:29:56.156 --> 00:30:00.080\nThere's spaces, right,\nbetween these columns of information.\n\n544\n00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.497\nSo I'm gonna delimit it by those spaces.\n\n545\n00:30:03.497 --> 00:30:08.298\nAnd I'll tell it I wanna -f2, because\nhere's the first column, host colon,\n\n546\n00:30:08.298 --> 00:30:10.050\nthen there's a space.\n\n547\n00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.475\nHere's a second field or column,\nwhich is the IP address, and\n\n548\n00:30:13.475 --> 00:30:15.033\nthat's the only one I want.\n\n549\n00:30:15.033 --> 00:30:21.347\nNow we're gonna take that, and\noutput that into livehost.txt.\n\n550\n00:30:21.347 --> 00:30:28.065\nAnd actually let's change that over to,\nLet's do.\n\n551\n00:30:30.985 --> 00:30:35.850\n/documents/livehosts.txt, all right.\n\n552\n00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.320\nSo hopefully you guys\ncan see that command.\n\n553\n00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:42.550\nI'll hit Enter.\nAnd then we'll cat that livehosts.\n\n554\n00:30:47.847 --> 00:30:48.550\nAnd look at that.\n\n555\n00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.134\nIt's just the IP addresses, all right.\n\n556\n00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:58.950\nSo now if I wanna do a port scan, right,\nbut I don't wanna scan every IP address.\n\n557\n00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:00.860\nI know which hosts are live.\n\n558\n00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.280\nI now have a list of them.\n\n559\n00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:07.497\nSo I can do Nmap, dash, I don't know,\nlet's do a TCP connect scan.\n\n560\n00:31:07.497 --> 00:31:13.622\nOr I'll show you a really cool one,\n--top-ports.\n\n561\n00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:15.249\nI can't remember if that's a plural or\nnot.\n\n562\n00:31:15.249 --> 00:31:16.443\nI think it is, ports.\n\n563\n00:31:16.443 --> 00:31:20.770\nWe'll do 100 and then a dash.\n\n564\n00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.350\nimport List, little i, capital L.\n\n565\n00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.961\nAnd tell it where that file is.\n\n566\n00:31:32.715 --> 00:31:34.100\nLet it run.\n\n567\n00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.179\nAnd there we go.\n\n568\n00:31:35.179 --> 00:31:38.477\nWe'll see there's a separate\nport scan run for\n\n569\n00:31:38.477 --> 00:31:41.870\neach one of those IP addresses, all right.\n\n570\n00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:46.807\nSo cool stuff there,\nthat --top-ports and then 100 says, hey,\n\n571\n00:31:46.807 --> 00:31:52.810\nscan the top 100 ports, not 0 through 100,\nthe most commonly used ports.\n\n572\n00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:56.120\nNmap has done some really cool stuff\nwhere they've done a lot of research and\n\n573\n00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:01.160\nthey can, if you do like, top ten, it'll\nscan the top ten most common open ports.\n\n574\n00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.423\nAnd we always spend a lot of\ntime doing port scans, and\n\n575\n00:32:03.423 --> 00:32:04.844\ntypically we do full port scans.\n\n576\n00:32:04.844 --> 00:32:11.570\nYou could do a -p 1-65535, and\nwe scan every single one of them.\n\n577\n00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:15.790\nBut when it comes down to it, if you\ndo the top 100, I forget the statistic,\n\n578\n00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.590\nyou can look it up on Nmap's site,\n\n579\n00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:22.810\nthe top 100 gets like the 99% of open\nports or something crazy like that.\n\n580\n00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.750\nIt's rare that you're using\nthese other random ports.\n\n581\n00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:29.485\nSo again, a lot of neat stuff\nyou can do with Nmap, and\n\n582\n00:32:29.485 --> 00:32:32.563\ndoing our environmental reconnaissance.\n\n583\n00:32:32.563 --> 00:32:36.491\nWe've got more that I wanna show you, but\nI know Wes is giving me that evil eye.\n\n584\n00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:39.470\nI think I have talked too much for\nthis episode.\n\n585\n00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:40.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've gone over a little bit.\n\n586\n00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:41.420\nBut you know what?\n\n587\n00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.160\nYou're in the middle of a scan,\nyou can't just pause the scan and\n\n588\n00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.610\nthen we hope when we come back.\n\n589\n00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:46.578\nHowever, though, Mike,\n\n590\n00:32:46.578 --> 00:32:48.773\nit does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n591\n00:32:48.773 --> 00:32:52.474\nBut before we go, got any additional maybe\nwords you might like to throw in this one,\n\n592\n00:32:52.474 --> 00:32:54.340\nand then we'll come back for part two?\n\n593\n00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I actually forgot to go back to my\nWindows machine to show you the results of\n\n594\n00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:59.860\nthat scan that was taking a long time.\n\n595\n00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.950\nRemember when I did the version,\nthe -v, all right?\n\n596\n00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:05.330\nSo let's take a look at\nmy screen one more time.\n\n597\n00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.731\nAnd remember, the first time we did it,\nwe saw some port and\n\n598\n00:33:08.731 --> 00:33:12.339\nservice information here, but\nnow take a look at the results,\n\n599\n00:33:12.339 --> 00:33:17.080\nhere was my -a that includes the\nversioning, and look at the difference.\n\n600\n00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.810\nNot only does it say what the service is,\nbut\n\n601\n00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:22.680\nwhat version of that service, all right?\n\n602\n00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.440\nI can see it's RPC over HTTP version 1.\n\n603\n00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:33.141\nAlso, you notice that this particular\nOS guest was the same as the -o.\n\n604\n00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:36.100\nAnd it's still confused,\nit doesn't know exactly what it is.\n\n605\n00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:36.760\nBut look down here.\n\n606\n00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:42.520\nIt ran, that -a includes smb-os-discovery.\n\n607\n00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.780\nIt's one of those scripts that's built in.\n\n608\n00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.988\nAnd look what it came up with.\n\n609\n00:33:46.988 --> 00:33:50.281\nOS, Windows Server 2016 data\ncenter evaluation 14393.\n\n610\n00:33:50.281 --> 00:33:54.378\nNot only is it telling me what OS, it\ncan see the version, right, it sees that\n\n611\n00:33:54.378 --> 00:33:58.559\ninformation, so I know exactly what's\nrunning on that particular machine.\n\n612\n00:33:58.559 --> 00:34:01.479\nSo, again, Nmap, fantastic tool.\n\n613\n00:34:01.479 --> 00:34:05.420\nGotta get in there and play with it,\nlearn those different switches.\n\n614\n00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.750\nLearn your most common ones,\nplay with it on both sides,\n\n615\n00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.660\ndo the command prompt as well\nas the graphical user interface.\n\n616\n00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:13.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike,\nthat's a lot of great information, and\n\n617\n00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.070\nI know you got plenty more to come.\n\n618\n00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:17.210\nSo we're definitely gonna\ngo into a part two.\n\n619\n00:34:17.210

00:00:08.478\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.478 --> 00:00:12.280\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.480\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.910\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.790\nAnd in today's episode we're coming\nback at you with more CompTIA CSA+ and\n\n8\n00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.810\nit's actually a part two on\nenvironmental reconnaissance.\n\n9\n00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.480\nJoining us back in the studios for\nthis topic, is Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.250\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.250\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.110\nGlad to be back, and excited.\n\n13\n00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.770\nAs you said, we're continuing on with\nour environmental reconnaissance.\n\n14\n00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.910\nGonna take a look at doing some packet\ncapture in this particular episode.\n\n15\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.180\nIn the previous episode we\nlooked at doing scans with Nmap,\n\n16\n00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.790\ntrying to discover what was out there\non a network, as far as devices go.\n\n17\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.590\nIt let me find live hosts.\n\n18\n00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.440\nWe didn't see it cuz it was\nmy virtual environment, but\n\n19\n00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.230\nyou can also find anything that\nwould respond on the network.\n\n20\n00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.470\nWe can start discovering devices,\naccess points, things like that.\n\n21\n00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.900\nNow I'm gonna take a look at again,\ndoing some packet capture.\n\n22\n00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.770\nAnd when it comes to doing\nenvironmental reconnaissance and\n\n23\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.840\nusing a packet capture utility.\n\n24\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.540\nReally what we're trying to do is\nget an idea of what protocols,\n\n25\n00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.970\nwhat kinda traffic is\ngoing across this network?\n\n26\n00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.147\nAgain, think about this,\n\n27\n00:01:14.147 --> 00:01:17.127\nif we're doing a penetration test\nwe don't know anything about it.\n\n28\n00:01:17.127 --> 00:01:20.310\nWe've done our scans,\nour sweeps, using Nmap.\n\n29\n00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.890\nAnd we've done our service discovery.\n\n30\n00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.440\nTrying to figure out what ports were open,\nand then looking at those ports and\n\n31\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.960\ndoing version with Nmap to discover\nthe services that are being offered.\n\n32\n00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.830\nAgain because we can use that information\nto find out what we're vulnerable to.\n\n33\n00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.095\nIf we're running a particular service,\na particular version of a service,\n\n34\n00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:40.660\nwhat vulnerabilities does it have?\n\n35\n00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.320\nAm I patched up against those?\n\n36\n00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.020\nHow can I mitigate those types of risks?\n\n37\n00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.830\nNow with our packet capture utilities,\n\n38\n00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.490\nor traffic analysis, or\nhowever you want to call it.\n\n39\n00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.210\nWe're gonna be looking at the traffic\nthat's going across the network.\n\n40\n00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.590\nAnd from this, what can I determine?\n\n41\n00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.620\nWell, I can see what\nprotocols are being used.\n\n42\n00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.320\nAnd I can see that there's a lot of DNS\ntraffic or there's a lot of I don't know.\n\n43\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.030\nLike here, Wes and\nI playing around a little while ago,\n\n44\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.680\ndiscovered that some of our devices are\nusing the new Precision Time Protocol V2.\n\n45\n00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.950\nAnd I didn't know we had any devices using\nthat until I did a packet capture and\n\n46\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.470\nI see all these packets going by.\n\n47\n00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.230\nSo this is a way to discover\nmaybe what services are running,\n\n48\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.060\nwho's communicating with whom,\nthings like that.\n\n49\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.370\nBasically just looking at the traffic\nthat's going across the network.\n\n50\n00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.210\nOne thing you do have to keep in mind when\nyou're going to do packet capture like\n\n51\n00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.910\nthis, is where you're at,\nwhat traffic you're gonna be able to see.\n\n52\n00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.190\nRemember that most organizations nowadays\n\n53\n00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.700\nare doing their networks with\nwhat we call switched ethernet.\n\n54\n00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.760\nMeaning that every device is\npatched down to the wall and\n\n55\n00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.660\nit goes back to a switch, and\nthat's giving that device a one to one or\n\n56\n00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.890\na point to point connection\nwith the switch.\n\n57\n00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.720\nAnd the switch,\nusing its content addressable memory,\n\n58\n00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.550\nis keeping track of who is out what port.\n\n59\n00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.000\nAnd so,\nif my computer's plugged into Port 10,\n\n60\n00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.130\nand there's traffic that this switch\nis supposed to be handling, if\n\n61\n00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.550\nit's not destined for me, for my computer,\nit's not gonna send it out Port 10.\n\n62\n00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.830\nSo I'll never see that traffic,\ncuz it wasn't destined for me.\n\n63\n00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.240\nThe only thing I'd be capturing would be\ntraffic that I'm already gonna see anyway,\n\n64\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.020\nbecause it's coming to my device.\n\n65\n00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.590\nSo we have to try to figure out\nhow we can see the traffic,\n\n66\n00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.030\nthe majority of the traffic.\n\n67\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.480\nEither getting on a mirrored\nport on a switch or\n\n68\n00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.530\na router where all traffic is\nsent to the appropriate port.\n\n69\n00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.420\nPlus the monitoring port or the mirrored\nport, there's different terms for it.\n\n70\n00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.130\nOr you slip a HUB in front of the switch\nand you plug a device into that.\n\n71\n00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.490\nAnd you do packet capture from there.\n\n72\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.470\nI've seen that done.\n\n73\n00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.630\nWe've done that in a couple\nof places I've worked.\n\n74\n00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.010\nTrying to monitor some employees and\nsee what they were doing.\n\n75\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.940\nWell, I had to be in front of the switch,\nbefore the switch was able to\n\n76\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.370\nsort out the traffic and\nsend it out to the appropriate port.\n\n77\n00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.370\nSo a couple things to think about.\n\n78\n00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.290\nYou also need to be able to turn your\nnetwork adapter into promiscuous mode.\n\n79\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.780\nBecause your network adapter is looking at\nthe data that's traveling across the wire,\n\n80\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.290\nand it's only going to accept data\n\n81\n00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.941\nif the destination address\nis your devices address.\n\n82\n00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.290\nAll right, the rest of it silently drops.\n\n83\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.810\nIf you go into promiscuous mode,\nyou can now start capturing traffic or\n\n84\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.910\nseeing traffic that wasn't destined for\nyou.\n\n85\n00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.710\nIt doesn't just ignore it if it doesn't\nhave you as a destination address.\n\n86\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.110\nMost modern network adapters do this.\n\n87\n00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.690\nBut it is something to consider.\n\n88\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.120\nAlso, you have to think\nabout wireless traffic and\n\n89\n00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.354\nthe fact that your packet capture\nutility has to support that.\n\n90\n00:04:35.354 --> 00:04:36.741\nThe one I'm using,\n\n91\n00:04:36.741 --> 00:04:41.130\nWireshark, I'll talk about in a second,\ndoes support wireless traffic.\n\n92\n00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.660\nBut it's something that\nwe've gotta consider.\n\n93\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.030\nI know that Wireshark\nactually has a beta for\n\n94\n00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.330\nUSB traffic, because we're seeing\na lot more USB being used.\n\n95\n00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.150\nEspecially with USB.\n\n96\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.390\nWes, you're the more with the protocols.\n\n97\n00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.320\nWhat, USB3 or USBC, I guess it is?\n\n98\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.250\n&gt;&gt; It's USB3, and\n\n99\n00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.810\nwe're going to start seeing more and more\nadoption of the USBC adapters and stuff.\n\n100\n00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.320\nAbsolutely.\n\n101\n00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.570\n&gt;&gt; And USBC is a high, high bandwidth and\n\n102\n00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.330\nis going to be doing a lot more than\njust what we're used to doing with USB.\n\n103\n00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.890\nSo you'll see networking go across it,\nfile transfers going across it,\n\n104\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.970\nvideo signals being sent across it.\n\n105\n00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.490\nSo it's important that I can\ncapture traffic on there as well.\n\n106\n00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.820\nSomething to consider, in the future it\nmight be something that I have to do.\n\n107\n00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.815\nAll right so,\nlet's talk about packet capture.\n\n108\n00:05:26.815 --> 00:05:29.370\nNow I'm going to use\na program called Wireshark.\n\n109\n00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.390\nIt's probably If you've been doing this\nat all, you've heard of Wireshark.\n\n110\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.380\nIt's been around for a long time as well.\n\n111\n00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.110\nIt actually comes from an older\nprogram called Ethereal.\n\n112\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.480\nGentlemen that developed it, or\n\n113\n00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.040\na couple of guys that developed\nEthereal ended up splitting.\n\n114\n00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.800\nLong story short,\none of the gentlemen kept the program but\n\n115\n00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.920\ncouldn't keep the name,\nso he named it Wireshark.\n\n116\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.170\nIf I got my story straight.\n\n117\n00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.430\nAnyway, the point is Wireshark\nhas been around for awhile.\n\n118\n00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.440\nAnd so that means that it's trusted.\n\n119\n00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.290\nThere's lots of documentation on it and\nit's free.\n\n120\n00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.830\nIt's another one of those free tools.\n\n121\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.850\nThere are many tools you could\nuse to do packet capture.\n\n122\n00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.317\nMicrosoft makes Network Monitor,\nthat it used to include but\n\n123\n00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:09.960\nnow you have to go get it.\n\n124\n00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.190\n&gt;&gt; There's dozens of other programs\non the Linux side that you can use.\n\n125\n00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.600\nWireshark runs fine in the Linux world.\n\n126\n00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.160\nTCP Dump is another one that's\na command line packet capture utility.\n\n127\n00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.830\nAll of these programs do the same thing.\n\n128\n00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.660\nThey're looking and\n\n129\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.750\ncapturing those raw packets before\nthey get passed to an application.\n\n130\n00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.720\nBefore they're translated into anything,\n\n131\n00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.400\nthe actual data that's\ngoing across the wire.\n\n132\n00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just going to say,\nMike, a couple of them that I've used.\n\n133\n00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.160\nOne that's been kind of updated,\nif you will, outdated,\n\n134\n00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.420\nI don't know,\nis Network Monitor inside of Windows.\n\n135\n00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.710\nToday I think it's called, it's not\nthe same program but they've now got what,\n\n136\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.080\nthe Message Analyzer.\n\n137\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.980\nSo it seems like you have\na lot of options out there.\n\n138\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.580\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n139\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.550\nAnd pick the one that you like best,\nright?\n\n140\n00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.110\nFor this exam, most likely\nthey'll call out Wireshark again.\n\n141\n00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.510\nBecause it's the free one, and they don't\nwant you to have to go buy a license or\n\n142\n00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.130\nanything just to study for the exam.\n\n143\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.730\nAnd in the end,\nthey all do about the same thing.\n\n144\n00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.730\nThey go about it pretty much the same way.\n\n145\n00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.730\nAnd we talked about packet captures,\n\n146\n00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.600\nwe are talking about grabbing\nthose raw packets, and\n\n147\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.240\nthen being able to filter the results,\nlook at the results in a meaningful way.\n\n148\n00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.810\nSo we can analyze what\nthe heck is going on.\n\n149\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.180\nSo why don't we just fire one up.\n\n150\n00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.854\nIf we take a look at my screen here,\nI'm on my client.\n\n151\n00:07:21.854 --> 00:07:27.909\nI have Wireshark installed, and\nI'm going to close that filter there.\n\n152\n00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:30.470\nWhen we lose this packet\ncapture utilities,\n\n153\n00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.245\nthere's 2 different\nfilters we will discuss.\n\n154\n00:07:32.245 --> 00:07:35.400\nThere's a capture filter and\na display filter.\n\n155\n00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.510\nCapture filter is going to work\nbefore the data is captured.\n\n156\n00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.570\nSo it's gonna allow me to limit\nhow much data I'm capturing.\n\n157\n00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.540\nBecause when we look at the network and\nif there is any number of hosts in there,\n\n158\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.440\nthere is gonna be a lot\nof traffic going on.\n\n159\n00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.190\nThey're all busy.\n\n160\n00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.670\nThey're all doing something.\n\n161\n00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.601\nThey're connecting somewhere.\n\n162\n00:07:51.601 --> 00:07:54.817\nSo you're gonna see ARP requests,\nDNS resolution requests,\n\n163\n00:07:54.817 --> 00:07:58.883\nauthentication requests, and if you've\ngot dozens and dozens or hundreds and\n\n164\n00:07:58.883 --> 00:08:02.765\nhundreds of nodes on a network The capture\ncan get really large really fast,\n\n165\n00:08:02.765 --> 00:08:04.055\nwhich is not a bad thing.\n\n166\n00:08:04.055 --> 00:08:06.920\nIt just means now I've gotta\nbe able to filter it down.\n\n167\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.640\nSo sometimes we can use a capture\nfilter to limit what we're capturing.\n\n168\n00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.170\nI know that at this particular point in\ntime, all I wanna see is ICMP traffic.\n\n169\n00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.070\nWell I can create an ICMP capture filter,\nand\n\n170\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.240\nthe program itself will\nignore all other traffic.\n\n171\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.130\nIt'll only capture ICMP traffic.\n\n172\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.770\nAll right, so when I go to look at it,\nit's all I really wanted to see.\n\n173\n00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.640\nBut I can't ever go back and\n\n174\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.990\nlook at any of the other things that were\ngoing on if I used that capture filter.\n\n175\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.230\nCuz it ignored everything else.\n\n176\n00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.200\nBut another way to do is to say, you know\nwhat, I'm not gonna use a capture filter.\n\n177\n00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.500\nI'll capture everything and then use\na display filter to limit the display.\n\n178\n00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.800\nNow, I've captured everything.\n\n179\n00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.310\nI can filter down to look at\njust what I wanna look at.\n\n180\n00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.550\nBut if I ever change my mind and\n\n181\n00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.340\nI wanna look at DHCP traffic,\nwell it's included in the capture.\n\n182\n00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.130\nSo I can create a Do display filter.\n\n183\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.380\nWhen you use a display filter, it doesn't\nremove any other packets from the capture,\n\n184\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.750\nit just filters them out temporarily for\nviewing purposes.\n\n185\n00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.730\n&gt;&gt; So think of it maybe as\na pre-capture versus post-capture, and\n\n186\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.410\nyou kinda gotta figure out ahead of time,\nwhat is it that I wanna see?\n\n187\n00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.120\nAm I gonna save this information for\nmaybe documentation later?\n\n188\n00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.510\nYou mentioned that\ncompany that you were in,\n\n189\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.810\nwhere you had to kinda figure\nout what people were doing.\n\n190\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.870\nMaybe you need to figure documentation,\nas well.\n\n191\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.890\nSo Mike, what do you say?\n\n192\n00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.350\nMaybe we launch this thing up and\nsee what we got going on on our network.\n\n193\n00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.770\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it, let's do it.\nI know this is a little bit small.\n\n194\n00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.839\nI'll zoom in here.\n\n195\n00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.650\nWhen you first fire up Wireshark,\n\n196\n00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.380\nit shows you your network\nadapters that you can pick from.\n\n197\n00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.620\nI can see ethernet is the one\nthat has the most traffic on it.\n\n198\n00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.590\nThat's the one that I'm going to monitor.\n\n199\n00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.400\nAlso, where I can apply a capture filter,\n\n200\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.700\nthere are a bunch of pre-built\ncapture filters that you can use.\n\n201\n00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.259\nIf my drop down list will work.\n\n202\n00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.900\nIt's not liking that.\n\n203\n00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.540\nBut there are some prebuild capture\nfilters that you can use, and\n\n204\n00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.270\nyou can write your own.\n\n205\n00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:57.090\nI know for example that a lot of PTP\nprotocols are going to show up and\n\n206\n00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.970\nmaybe I just don't want to\ncapture that in the first place.\n\n207\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.790\nBecause I know I'm going\nto filter it out anyway.\n\n208\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.650\nI might as well not capture it.\n\n209\n00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.500\nI never look at it.\n\n210\n00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.580\nI don't need it.\n\n211\n00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.920\nSo, I can put a capture filter there.\n\n212\n00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.860\nI'm just gonna let it get everything.\n\n213\n00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.040\nChoose ethernet.\n\n214\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.360\nThen I'm going to click on the blue\nfin up here to start my capture.\n\n215\n00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.719\nOkay, so I'll let this chug along for\njust a second.\n\n216\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.350\nYou let it get a few packets in.\n\n217\n00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.540\nAnd you see, I mean what am I going to go?\n\n218\n00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.960\nI've been going for\nabout 10 seconds, 15 seconds?\n\n219\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.820\nAnd I don't have a very\nlarge network here.\n\n220\n00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.660\nI'm already on packet 817,\nthat it's captured.\n\n221\n00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.350\nSo I'll go ahead and\nstop the actual capture.\n\n222\n00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.280\nAnd we can go ahead and look at some\nof the packets that are going by.\n\n223\n00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.370\nAll right.\n\n224\n00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.800\nSo now that I got this information here,\nlet's bump that.\n\n225\n00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.210\nI think I can bump this up a wee bit for\nus, Wes.\n\n226\n00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.860\nLet's see if we can make\nthis a little bit larger.\n\n227\n00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.120\nYeah, nine, that's for young eyes.\n\n228\n00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.209\nLet's go over to 12.\n\n229\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.620\nMake that a little bit bigger,\n\n230\n00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.200\nhopefully that will show up\na little better on screen.\n\n231\n00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.540\nSo basically in this\nparticular program and again,\n\n232\n00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.620\nmost of them are the same,\nmight be laid out a little differently.\n\n233\n00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.010\nUp at the top are the raw\npackets that are coming through.\n\n234\n00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.730\nI can click on each one and you notice the\nother two panes are changing as I click on\n\n235\n00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:24.570\nthem because in the middle pane I can\nactually break it down to the frame.\n\n236\n00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.460\nI can see the ethernet header\ninformation like source and destination.\n\n237\n00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.190\nI can look at the IP header information\nwhereas the ethernet is the Mac,\n\n238\n00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:37.090\nthe IP has the actual IP addresses,\nsource and destination.\n\n239\n00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.050\nThis particular one looks like it was UDP.\n\n240\n00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.490\nSo there's some UDP information.\n\n241\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.020\nAnd there's my PTP info for\nthis particular packet.\n\n242\n00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.130\n&gt;&gt; Hi, Mike.\nNow,\n\n243\n00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.880\nwhich set of defense are we on on this\none, is this a pre-filter or is this we've\n\n244\n00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.250\nalready captured it and we're filtering\nessentially the logs that we have.\n\n245\n00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.300\n&gt;&gt; This would be the latter.\n\n246\n00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.420\nSo this one is the display filter\nwhich is done after the capture.\n\n247\n00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:07.380\nSo I'm gonna go up here to the top and\nI've got my apply a display filter option,\n\n248\n00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.350\nthere is a drop down list where you can\npick some, these are like recent ones that\n\n249\n00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:16.060\nI've done, you can go and click expression\nover here at the top right, and\n\n250\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.770\nI can build filters using all of this.\n\n251\n00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.170\nLook at how long this list is.\n\n252\n00:12:21.292 --> 00:12:26.220\nAll right, and then you've got is press\nand equals, not equals, greater than,\n\n253\n00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:32.740\ncontains and we can also throw in,\nands and ors to combine filters.\n\n254\n00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.930\nAll right, so I'm gonna close that and\nI'm gonna make my own.\n\n255\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.340\nSo all I'm gonna do,\nlet's say not PTP, all right?\n\n256\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.160\nNotice how that bar is red?\n\n257\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.900\nThat's telling me that my\nfilter is not gonna work,\n\n258\n00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.660\nthat my filter's not doing anything\nthat it doesn't understand.\n\n259\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.730\nAs soon as I put that last P in there,\nnow it says!\n\n260\n00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.660\nThe protocol, PTP,\nI know what you're talking about.\n\n261\n00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.740\nAnd you see the bar turns green.\n\n262\n00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.440\nThat lets me know, hey,\nI've got my filter in correctly.\n\n263\n00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.290\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nhit Enter to apply that filter.\n\n264\n00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:05.717\nAnd if we look at this list now, as I\nscroll through here, no PTP, all right?\n\n265\n00:13:05.717 --> 00:13:11.582\nYou know,\nthere's also a lot of link local and,\n\n266\n00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:15.610\nso let's do a, let's combine.\n\n267\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:24.130\nI can do an and, not LLMNR, all right, and\nyou'll see all those start disappearing.\n\n268\n00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.150\nSo see how that can\nstart filtering it down.\n\n269\n00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.730\nNow, if I want to get rid of a couple,\nhere's how we would do it.\n\n270\n00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.000\nWhat if I only want to see TCP,\nI'm not going to type in every protocol.\n\n271\n00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.270\nNot this, not that, not this,\nnot that, not this, not that, right?\n\n272\n00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:41.810\nSo it would be easier to just say TCP.\n\n273\n00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.500\nAnd hit enter.\n\n274\n00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.950\nAnd now there's only three little\nTCP packets in that entire capture.\n\n275\n00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.150\nAll right, so\nthose are your display filters,\n\n276\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:54.020\nbeing able to filter down\nwhat it is your looking at.\n\n277\n00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.925\nGuys, gals, if you're gonna get into\nsecurity, you've got to play around with\n\n278\n00:13:57.925 --> 00:14:01.436\nthese packet capture utilities,\nyou've gotta get familiar with them,\n\n279\n00:14:01.436 --> 00:14:04.459\nyou've gotta see the information\nthat you can get out of them.\n\n280\n00:14:04.459 --> 00:14:06.947\nReally not quite this class,\nbut as you move on,\n\n281\n00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:10.080\nyou need to be able to read the raw\ndata out of these packages.\n\n282\n00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.820\nYou need to be able to come down here and\n\n283\n00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.440\nstart figuring out what this stuff is,\nright.\n\n284\n00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.620\nWhen we look at,\nlets take this TCP packet, here.\n\n285\n00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.880\nI'll expand this out.\n\n286\n00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.440\nAnd let's see,\nit actually let me look at the IP header.\n\n287\n00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.900\nAll right, and\nhere's my source and destination.\n\n288\n00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.653\nNotice how, as I click on these lines,\n\n289\n00:14:29.653 --> 00:14:31.950\nwhat's being highlighted\ndown here is changing.\n\n290\n00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.343\nSo, when I click on source and\ndestination, well, there they are, but\n\n291\n00:14:36.343 --> 00:14:37.765\nyou can't read them, right?\n\n292\n00:14:37.765 --> 00:14:41.906\n45 00 00 28 31, that's hex!\n\n293\n00:14:41.906 --> 00:14:46.237\nBut you should be able to convert\nhex into binary, into decimal, and\n\n294\n00:14:46.237 --> 00:14:49.386\nend up with 10.0.100.100, right?\n\n295\n00:14:49.386 --> 00:14:55.170\nSo that's something you need to practice\nat, to do a little better at it.\n\n296\n00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:59.470\nJust being able to read those raw packets,\nall right.\n\n297\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.160\nLet's see what else I\nwanna show you with this.\n\n298\n00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.400\nYou can save this output to a file.\n\n299\n00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.100\nYou can open them up later.\n\n300\n00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.850\nThere's many different\nformats you can save it as.\n\n301\n00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:14.640\nWhen I click save, you can see there's\na list of options here to save it as.\n\n302\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.500\nSo if you're using another\nprogram that you wanna try and\n\n303\n00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:22.310\ninterpret these results with or\ncompile multiple captures together,\n\n304\n00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.020\nyou can use this, maybe schedule captures\nto occur at different periods of time.\n\n305\n00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.290\nYou want to save them and\nthen go back and open up later and\n\n306\n00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.560\nactually take a look at them.\n\n307\n00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.000\nSo, good to know that I can\nactually save those captures.\n\n308\n00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.505\nYou know, I'll tell you, I've used\nthings like TCP dump, command line.\n\n309\n00:15:36.505 --> 00:15:40.886\nCuz it's real quick, easy to fire up\na scan, save it as a capture file,\n\n310\n00:15:40.886 --> 00:15:46.016\nI'll put it to a file and then turn around\nand use Wireshark to open that capture up.\n\n311\n00:15:46.016 --> 00:15:49.423\nBecause I love the filters in here and\nthe ability to narrow it down and\n\n312\n00:15:49.423 --> 00:15:51.658\nfollow conversations and things like that,\n\n313\n00:15:51.658 --> 00:15:54.910\nthat I have more difficult\ntime doing through TCP dump.\n\n314\n00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.616\nSo TCP dump is great at doing the capture.\n\n315\n00:15:57.616 --> 00:16:00.904\nMaybe I don't wanna install\nWireshark in all these machines so\n\n316\n00:16:00.904 --> 00:16:02.888\nI can just use TCP dump to capture it And\n\n317\n00:16:02.888 --> 00:16:06.440\nthen take it back to my machine with\nWireshark and analyze it later.\n\n318\n00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:11.160\nAll right, let's take a look at,\nwhat else do we wanna do?\n\n319\n00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.100\nI wanna capture some data.\n\n320\n00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:18.240\nI wanna show you an example of,\nwhat am I thinking?\n\n321\n00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.670\nI wanna capture a transfer\njust to show you guys,\n\n322\n00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.230\nwe're seeing the raw packet data here.\n\n323\n00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:29.820\nSo what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna open up file explorer and\n\n324\n00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.160\nI'm gonna connect to a share.\n\n325\n00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:38.410\nGo back over to client two docs and\nthere's a file called secret.txt.\n\n326\n00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:42.810\nI'm going to start a new capture and\nI'll continue without saving.\n\n327\n00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.675\nAnd then I'm gonna copy this\nfile over to my downloads and\n\n328\n00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:50.020\nthen I'm gonna stop my capture real quick.\n\n329\n00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.040\nTry to limit the number of packets\nthat I was actually capturing.\n\n330\n00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:00.296\nAnd I can see S&amp;B right here, it was a\npretty short capture, but if I needed to,\n\n331\n00:17:00.296 --> 00:17:03.970\nall right, I could come up here,\nfilter this down to S&amp;B.\n\n332\n00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.920\nMaybe it was SMB 2 in my\ncase that was doing those.\n\n333\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.420\nAll right.\n\n334\n00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.540\nSo here I can see the conversation.\n\n335\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.310\n100 is the machine I'm on,\n102 was the one that had the file.\n\n336\n00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.782\nAnd let's take a look at this bottom\npane down here as I go through this.\n\n337\n00:17:24.181 --> 00:17:25.340\nAll right.\n\n338\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.820\nNow I could go right to it but just to\nshow you what you would normally do,\n\n339\n00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.850\nyou might just use your down arrow\nto kind of thumb through here.\n\n340\n00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:35.390\nThis is all the machines talking to\neach other, setting up the SMB session,\n\n341\n00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.890\nrequesting the file, you can see\ncreate request file secret.text.text.\n\n342\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.460\nAs I go down here my response.\n\n343\n00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.720\nAnd then eventually there's\nmy read response right there.\n\n344\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.557\nFrom 102 back to me.\n\n345\n00:17:48.557 --> 00:17:52.910\nThat was the actual file being transferred\nacross the network and look down here.\n\n346\n00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.253\nCan you guys see that?\nIf I can get my cursor out of the way and\n\n347\n00:17:57.253 --> 00:17:59.370\nstill highlight it.\n\n348\n00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:05.018\nThere we go.\nAccount number 101-54978-74563.\n\n349\n00:18:05.018 --> 00:18:08.879\nAll right, so that's the information\nthat was in the file,\n\n350\n00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:12.070\nthat's the actual data\nthat resided in the file.\n\n351\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:16.730\nAll right, if we go take a look\nat that file, there it is,\n\n352\n00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.370\naccount information,\naccount number, and that number.\n\n353\n00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:23.880\nSo my point here was,\nIf you're not using secure protocols,\n\n354\n00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.790\nthen anybody that's running one\nof these packet capture utilities\n\n355\n00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.760\ncan capture data that's traveling\nacross the network and read it.\n\n356\n00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.860\nIf Wes was to send an email to\nthe boss right now, saying gosh,\n\n357\n00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.550\nhe hates working with Mike,\nI could capture that information.\n\n358\n00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.750\nAnd if I was really good,\nI could try to stop it and modify it and\n\n359\n00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.160\nthen send it on its way, right?\n\n360\n00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.170\nMike is the best guy\nI've ever worked with.\n\n361\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.820\nWe all know that's not true.\n\n362\n00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.550\nNo.\n[LAUGH] But I just wanted to show\n\n363\n00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:51.010\nyou what you can see using\nthese packet capture utilities.\n\n364\n00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:57.820\nAlso, this brings me to another good\nlittle reminder or warning, if you will.\n\n365\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.400\nYou need to practice with this stuff,\nyou need to run Nmap,\n\n366\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.030\nyou need to run Wireshark,\nyou need to play around with these tools.\n\n367\n00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.500\nBe careful about where you're doing it.\n\n368\n00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:10.250\nDon't go into work tomorrow and\ninstall Wireshark on your work machine and\n\n369\n00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:14.840\nstart capturing traffic, because you\ncould get into a lot of trouble.\n\n370\n00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.770\nMost likely it's against your\nacceptable use for your equipment,\n\n371\n00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.540\nyou're probably not supposed to do it.\n\n372\n00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.800\nAnd the reason is, what if the boss\nwas sending an email to somebody and\n\n373\n00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.400\nit had pay information or\nprivate personal information?\n\n374\n00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.130\nI could see that.\n\n375\n00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.870\nI could see information that\nI'm not allowed to access.\n\n376\n00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.560\nI'm not allowed to see that file.\n\n377\n00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.710\nBut when the payroll person sends\nit over to the boss for approval,\n\n378\n00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.930\nI was able to capture it and read\neverybody's salary out of there, right?\n\n379\n00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.860\nI can end up seeing stuff that\nI'm not authorized to see.\n\n380\n00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.260\nSo do be careful with this.\n\n381\n00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.110\nIt will get you into a little bit\nof trouble with your organization\n\n382\n00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.260\nif they catch you running them.\n\n383\n00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.900\nAnd it is detectable, believe it or not.\n\n384\n00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.340\nThey can detect the fact that\npackets are being captured.\n\n385\n00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.470\nAnd they will come give you a little\nknock on the door, most likely.\n\n386\n00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.590\nSo be careful with that.\n\n387\n00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.050\nWe talked about display filters,\ncapture filters.\n\n388\n00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.490\nWe talked about packet capture in general.\n\n389\n00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:07.665\nWhat am I missing there?\n\n390\n00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:10.720\nWes, anything, so again,\n\n391\n00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.520\nanother term that they might use\non the exam, packet analyzer.\n\n392\n00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:20.500\nThat's really the classification of what\nthese programs are, things like Wireshark.\n\n393\n00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.990\nThere are other tools we could look at,\nprotocol analyzer, and\n\n394\n00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.370\nI think we'll look at\nthose in a later episode.\n\n395\n00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:30.755\nThat kind of does the same thing like\nEtherApe is the one I always go to.\n\n396\n00:20:30.755 --> 00:20:32.460\nIt's an older one.\n\n397\n00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.430\nIt's a protocol analyzer.\n\n398\n00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:37.480\nAnd what's is doing is looking at\npackets just like Wireshark does but\n\n399\n00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.040\nit's not saving all this information about\nheader information, footer, payloads.\n\n400\n00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.202\nIt's just looking at the protocols and\n\n401\n00:20:43.202 --> 00:20:46.680\nbasically building a chart\nlike a pie chart showing you.\n\n402\n00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.980\nHey, look, there's this amount of\ntraffic on your network is DNS.\n\n403\n00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.886\nThis percentage of traffic is DHCP.\n\n404\n00:20:51.886 --> 00:20:54.020\nThis percentage is PTP.\n\n405\n00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.340\nSometimes those are really good to use.\n\n406\n00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:59.710\nLike I might find that PTP2 is\n80% of the traffic on my network.\n\n407\n00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.360\nSo maybe if I can get rid of some of that,\n\n408\n00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.020\nI can free up some\nbandwidth on my network.\n\n409\n00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.010\nSo that'd be a protocol analyzer, versus\nWireshark which is a packet analyzer\n\n410\n00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.880\nallowing me to analyze these raw packets.\n\n411\n00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.770\nAlso when you run these,\nif you're on a Windows based machine,\n\n412\n00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:20.100\nit will ask you if you wanna\ninstall something called WinPcap.\n\n413\n00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.690\nNmap will do, what is it, Ncap I think.\n\n414\n00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:27.190\nWhat those are, those are little libraries\n\n415\n00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.430\nthat allow these programs to work\nwith the raw packet information.\n\n416\n00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.370\nWindows doesn't include them because they\ndon't feel like most end users need or\n\n417\n00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.520\nwant to work with raw data.\n\n418\n00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.370\nSo, you do have to make sure you install\nthat, when you install one of these.\n\n419\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.560\nLike Wireshark for example prompts you.\n\n420\n00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.480\nSays hey, I don't detect WinPcap,\ndo you want me to install it?\n\n421\n00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.540\nYou say yes and you're good to go.\n\n422\n00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.670\nOthers might not warn you or\n\n423\n00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.050\nprompt you and they might just fail,\nnot capture anything.\n\n424\n00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:57.910\nSo keep in mind you might need to add\na couple libraries to be able to work with\n\n425\n00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.080\nthe raw packet data.\n\n426\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.170\n&gt;&gt; Mike, when it comes to things like\nenvironmental reconnaissance and stuff,\n\n427\n00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.070\nif I am trying to gather data, one of the\nthings that I see that comes up a lot is,\n\n428\n00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:12.480\nthat we have to, and\nnot only a performance issue,\n\n429\n00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.960\nis more of a security issue as well.\n\n430\n00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.610\nAre the logs, the logs that you have\non various devices across your network\n\n431\n00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.370\nwhether from a Windows standpoint,\n\n432\n00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.980\nI think it's something just very\nbasic like or a lot of logs in there.\n\n433\n00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.560\nAnd there is security logs but\nthere's a lot of information.\n\n434\n00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.690\nWhat do we have to worry about\nfrom a security standpoint and\n\n435\n00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.950\nfrom a reconnaissance\nstandpoint about those logs.\n\n436\n00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.660\n&gt;&gt; Well the main thing is collecting\nthem and that's the biggest thing.\n\n437\n00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.490\nWe know that all machines typically,\nI guess I should say all Windows machines.\n\n438\n00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.520\nLinux included though.\n\n439\n00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.010\nLinux has them.\n\n440\n00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.920\nOS X has them.\n\n441\n00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.065\nThey've got their logging\nthat they can do and\n\n442\n00:22:46.065 --> 00:22:49.320\nthis is a place where your\nsystem is recording information.\n\n443\n00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.957\nAnd it's important that we can capture\nthat information and go back and\n\n444\n00:22:52.957 --> 00:22:54.790\nanalyze that information.\n\n445\n00:22:54.790 --> 00:23:00.080\nBecause let's say, I think somebody logged\ninto my machine at 11 o'clock at night and\n\n446\n00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.670\ncopied some files off, right.\n\n447\n00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.249\nWell I can go into the log files and\nlook and\n\n448\n00:23:04.249 --> 00:23:07.947\nsee that somebody indeed\nauthenticated at 11:42 PM.\n\n449\n00:23:07.947 --> 00:23:12.201\nI can see what the user account that was\nused, I can see depending on the logging\n\n450\n00:23:12.201 --> 00:23:16.801\nlevels that I've set up, what they were\naccessing, right, and things like that.\n\n451\n00:23:16.801 --> 00:23:21.301\nSo logging is very important, and\nusually we log, we don't go back and\n\n452\n00:23:21.301 --> 00:23:25.876\nread them all the time, although we\nshould, we wait until something's\n\n453\n00:23:25.876 --> 00:23:29.960\nhappened and then we try to dive in and\ngo look at the logs.\n\n454\n00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.280\nBut another important thing about logging.\n\n455\n00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.460\nOne, configuring it, making sure you're\ncapturing appropriate information, that\n\n456\n00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.210\nyou're clearing those logs occasionally,\nafter you've saved them, to free up space.\n\n457\n00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.740\nBut then being able to correlate\nthem is another big thing.\n\n458\n00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.880\nBeing able to bring it all together.\n\n459\n00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.880\nWe're gonna spend a little more\ntime on that in a later episode.\n\n460\n00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.682\nBut for now, I wanna show you a utility\nthat you can use that'll allow me to\n\n461\n00:23:54.682 --> 00:23:57.874\npull logs from different machines,\nall right?\n\n462\n00:23:57.874 --> 00:24:01.395\nWith logging, each Windows machine,\nfor example, is doing its own logging.\n\n463\n00:24:01.395 --> 00:24:05.815\nAnd it's saving it into the one of\nthe dozens of logs that it has.\n\n464\n00:24:05.815 --> 00:24:08.811\nBut if I wanna see those logs,\nI now have to go to that machine,\n\n465\n00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:12.410\nwhether I remote into it, or\nphysically go visit that machine.\n\n466\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:16.530\nAnd if I have to do that times 100 and\nwhat we got, 125 severs?\n\n467\n00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:21.150\nAm I really gonna go to 125 different\nmachines one at a time, log in and\n\n468\n00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.080\nlook at that information.\n\n469\n00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.160\nI should, but I'm not going to\n[LAUGH] cuz I'm a lazy admin.\n\n470\n00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.637\nThere are tools that we can use to\nbring that information together,\n\n471\n00:24:29.637 --> 00:24:30.985\nbring it all to one place.\n\n472\n00:24:30.985 --> 00:24:36.500\nWindows has some built in\ncapabilities to do log subscriptions.\n\n473\n00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.010\nVery cool if you haven't seen that, the\nevent viewer system has been revamped, and\n\n474\n00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:42.680\nyou can do subscriptions in there.\n\n475\n00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.822\nSo, I can have logs from multiple\nplaces sent to one location.\n\n476\n00:24:47.822 --> 00:24:49.362\nBut there's also programs,\n\n477\n00:24:49.362 --> 00:24:52.324\nutilities out there that you\ncan use to do the same thing.\n\n478\n00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:57.993\nSyslog type systems, SEEM,\nKiwi is one that I think,\n\n479\n00:24:57.993 --> 00:25:02.444\nit's SolarWinds puts out, Kiwi Syslog.\n\n480\n00:25:02.444 --> 00:25:06.353\nThat's one I've got installed here,\ncuz they had a free 14 day trial, and\n\n481\n00:25:06.353 --> 00:25:08.710\nI wanted to try to stay\nplatform independent.\n\n482\n00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:12.550\nSo, I'm not gonna use the Windows\nsubscription system, but\n\n483\n00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:14.110\nit really makes life a lot easier.\n\n484\n00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:18.590\nIf you're the person that's responsible\nfor going through those logs and\n\n485\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.880\nnoticing when something out\nof the ordinary is going on.\n\n486\n00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.531\nThe idea is by analyzing my\nlogs I can see what's going on.\n\n487\n00:25:24.531 --> 00:25:27.254\nAgain, we're talking on environmental\nreconnaissance at this point.\n\n488\n00:25:27.254 --> 00:25:30.338\nI need to see that people are logging into\nmy servers in the middle of the night,\n\n489\n00:25:30.338 --> 00:25:32.680\nwhen I didn't think anybody\nwas on the network.\n\n490\n00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.062\nI need to see that somebody is\nestablishing a VPN connection,\n\n491\n00:25:37.062 --> 00:25:39.094\nfrom Timbuktu or whatever.\n\n492\n00:25:39.094 --> 00:25:42.450\nHey, do we have a sales user on\nthe road and in Timbuktu right now?\n\n493\n00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.972\nWho's making this connection?\n\n494\n00:25:43.972 --> 00:25:47.860\nI'm not gonna notice that kind of stuff,\nif I don't go and analyze the logs.\n\n495\n00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.780\nSo, it's important that somebody has this\n\n496\n00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.510\nwonderfully exciting job\nof looking at the logs.\n\n497\n00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:58.270\nBut luckily for us, with these programs\nwe can bring it all together and\n\n498\n00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.820\nthen we can do some nice searching and\nfiltering through there and\n\n499\n00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.090\nwe can start correlating.\n\n500\n00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:06.216\nAnother thing that we need to do is we\nneed to be able to correlate logs from\n\n501\n00:26:06.216 --> 00:26:07.001\ndifferent time.\n\n502\n00:26:07.001 --> 00:26:09.787\nWe're, like I said,\ngonna take a brief look at it here.\n\n503\n00:26:09.787 --> 00:26:13.051\nWe'll go into it in depth and\na little more later,\n\n504\n00:26:13.051 --> 00:26:15.470\na little later on I should say.\n\n505\n00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.990\nBut, let's say there's\nan attack going on and\n\n506\n00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.770\nwe're pretty sure that somebody\ncompromised one of my file servers and\n\n507\n00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:24.890\ngot into the credit card information for\nmy customers, right?\n\n508\n00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:29.341\nWell, I can look at the logs on that\nserver and I can see that indeed this\n\n509\n00:26:29.341 --> 00:26:34.717\ninformation was accessed at 1 o'clock in\nthe morning when nobody should be there.\n\n510\n00:26:34.717 --> 00:26:36.150\nHow did they get there?\n\n511\n00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.608\nWell now I need to look at\nlogs from my router and\n\n512\n00:26:39.608 --> 00:26:42.898\nsee when this connection was established.\n\n513\n00:26:42.898 --> 00:26:46.047\nIf I can pull all these logs together and\nstart looking,\n\n514\n00:26:46.047 --> 00:26:48.595\nas long as they're correlated time-wise,\n\n515\n00:26:48.595 --> 00:26:52.763\nI can follow this attack through my\nnetwork and find out what's going on.\n\n516\n00:26:52.763 --> 00:26:54.588\nBut again, we're not really there yet.\n\n517\n00:26:54.588 --> 00:26:58.350\nAt this point, we're just doing\nenvironmental reconnaissance.\n\n518\n00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:03.080\nSo at this stage, I just wanna show you\nhow you can bring these logs together and\n\n519\n00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.520\nput them in one place to view them.\n\n520\n00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.900\nSo, let's jump over to my client.\n\n521\n00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:12.482\nI'm gonna close down Wireshark,\nI'm not gonna save that, get rid of that.\n\n522\n00:27:12.482 --> 00:27:16.880\nAnd on the client,\nI've installed part of the puzzle.\n\n523\n00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.450\nI've got this Solar Winds Event\nLog Forwarder, for Windows.\n\n524\n00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.730\nI'm gonna go ahead and open that up.\n\n525\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:28.760\nAgain, this is actually a free part of it,\nyou have to pay for the other part of it.\n\n526\n00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.090\nBut it allows me to choose what logs,\n\n527\n00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.340\nlike I could say subscriptions and\nI think I chose, let's edit this one.\n\n528\n00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:41.210\nI said send over the application,\nsecurity, and system.\n\n529\n00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.190\nBut it sees all the logs\non this Windows machine.\n\n530\n00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.150\nSo, whatever it is I\nneed to have sent over.\n\n531\n00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.819\nI might not want information,\nthat's just success messages, so\n\n532\n00:27:50.819 --> 00:27:52.924\nmaybe I don't want that, maybe I do.\n\n533\n00:27:52.924 --> 00:27:58.301\nSo, I can control the classification\nof the events that I'm sending over,\n\n534\n00:27:58.301 --> 00:28:00.827\nyou can define a priority for that.\n\n535\n00:28:00.827 --> 00:28:03.380\nI'll go ahead and cancel this,\nI don't want to change anything there.\n\n536\n00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.150\nAnd then you identify your servers.\n\n537\n00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.111\nWho am I sending this to?\n\n538\n00:28:07.111 --> 00:28:11.470\nIn my case, I've installed\nthe kiwisyslog server on SVR01.\n\n539\n00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:15.550\nSo, I've told it the server's name,\nIP address,\n\n540\n00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.700\nthe port number that I'm using,\nthe protocol that I'm using.\n\n541\n00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.520\nThis is what that's gonna be\nused to ship those logs over.\n\n542\n00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.370\nI'll go ahead and cancel that out.\n\n543\n00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.130\nI don't wanna change anything.\n\n544\n00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.151\nThere's an option to send test\nmessages when you first set this up.\n\n545\n00:28:27.151 --> 00:28:31.087\nYou can send test messages to see\nif you've got everything set up.\n\n546\n00:28:31.087 --> 00:28:36.405\nNow, we're gonna flip over to server one,\nAnd\n\n547\n00:28:36.405 --> 00:28:43.320\nI'm gonna open up the Syslog server\nconsole, I've still got my trial going.\n\n548\n00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.700\nAnd here you can see all the messages.\n\n549\n00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.540\nIn fact if you look at the host name or\n\n550\n00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:53.010\nthe source address 10.0.100.100,\nthat's client one.\n\n551\n00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.030\nServer one is actually 201,\n\n552\n00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.060\nso it's showing you that these\nare from a remote machine.\n\n553\n00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.710\nThese are not local\nevents that are going on.\n\n554\n00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.730\nSo, it's allowing me to\ncapture that information.\n\n555\n00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.770\nThere's a lot of options you\ncan set up in here as well, but\n\n556\n00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.201\nagain this really isnt\na class on Kiwi Syslog.\n\n557\n00:29:10.201 --> 00:29:15.439\nIt's just the concept of doing log\nreview and making sure that we know\n\n558\n00:29:15.439 --> 00:29:20.606\nhow to go about it, what program I\nmight use and what the concept is.\n\n559\n00:29:20.606 --> 00:29:23.950\nAnd really, it's just about making\nit easier for me to get this\n\n560\n00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:28.650\ninformation because we know that we're\nnot going to go to every single machine.\n\n561\n00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.880\nBut if I take the time to set this up,\nI can go to one place and\n\n562\n00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.840\nI can filter this down to say\njust errors and warnings.\n\n563\n00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.050\nAnd I can see all the errors and\n\n564\n00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.300\nwarnings that have occurred on\nall my servers in one place.\n\n565\n00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.110\nOr all of my client machines in one place.\n\n566\n00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:48.207\nSo, programs like this really make\nit easier to crunch the logs,\n\n567\n00:29:48.207 --> 00:29:51.915\nbeing able to see what's going on,\nagain, and\n\n568\n00:29:51.915 --> 00:29:56.013\nbasically do your\nenvironmental reconnaissance.\n\n569\n00:29:56.013 --> 00:29:58.110\nAll right, and that is Syslog.\n\n570\n00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.823\nLike I said, there is not a lot else,\nlet me see if I can,\n\n571\n00:30:01.823 --> 00:30:04.919\nthere are some highlighting\noptions in here.\n\n572\n00:30:04.919 --> 00:30:07.920\nYou wanna create some default\nrules based on Syslog priorities.\n\n573\n00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.550\nNow again like I said this is definitely\nnot a class on this particular program.\n\n574\n00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.480\nBut most of these types of programs\nwill have something similar,\n\n575\n00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.600\nwhere I can go in and create filters.\n\n576\n00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.210\nSo I can see I just wanna see\nfrom a particular source, or\n\n577\n00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:24.230\na particular destination, or a particular\nprotocol, or a particular warning.\n\n578\n00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:28.130\nYou can even do keywords and\nlook for words within an error.\n\n579\n00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:32.520\nYou know that in the error message you're\nlooking for it says time protocol.\n\n580\n00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.440\nSo, I could create a filter on here,\nstrings to match.\n\n581\n00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.863\nI can put in time protocol and whether I\nwanna do an expression or ignore case and\n\n582\n00:30:39.863 --> 00:30:40.943\nthings like that.\n\n583\n00:30:40.943 --> 00:30:44.426\nLet's do one, let's add one,\nlet's see if I can find something,\n\n584\n00:30:44.426 --> 00:30:46.333\nthere's time-based right there.\n\n585\n00:30:46.333 --> 00:30:50.694\nSo, let's do, time-based.\n\n586\n00:30:50.694 --> 00:30:53.530\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike, I have four eyes so\nit's a little hard for me to see.\n\n587\n00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:54.850\nYou must have it on satellite view.\n\n588\n00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.447\nIs there any way you might be\nable to change that font for\n\n589\n00:30:56.447 --> 00:30:58.535\nour viewers out there,\nmake it a little easier for them to see?\n\n590\n00:30:58.535 --> 00:30:59.850\n&gt;&gt; I can probably swing that.\n\n591\n00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.738\nI don't know if you noticed me getting\na little closer to the computer trying to\n\n592\n00:31:02.738 --> 00:31:03.716\nread some of this anyway.\n\n593\n00:31:03.716 --> 00:31:05.370\nSo let's cancel out of that for a second.\n\n594\n00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:08.159\nWe'll go up to our View menu and\nchange font.\n\n595\n00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.922\nAnd we'll bump that up to say a 12,\nand let's get rid of the bold, too.\n\n596\n00:31:11.922 --> 00:31:13.432\nThat's kind of annoying.\n\n597\n00:31:13.432 --> 00:31:17.098\nAnd we'll click OK, and\nthat looks a little bit better.\n\n598\n00:31:17.098 --> 00:31:19.870\nLittle easier to read,\nis that big enough for you?\n\n599\n00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:20.511\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that looks good.\n\n600\n00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:27.164\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now what I wanna\ndo is if I wanna do a highlight.\n\n601\n00:31:27.164 --> 00:31:33.780\nBasically, I'm looking for an error that\nhas the word, let's say, time-based in it.\n\n602\n00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.570\nOr a message, just a log entry that\nhas the word time-based in it.\n\n603\n00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:41.120\nHighlighting options allows\nme to create expressions.\n\n604\n00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.490\nSo, in this case I'm gonna choose,\n\n605\n00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:49.730\nI'll say string to match,\nI'm gonna say time-based.\n\n606\n00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:53.943\nAnd I'm gonna change that\nbackground color to like a green.\n\n607\n00:31:57.329 --> 00:32:02.000\nAnd I'll even make it bold.\n\n608\n00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.800\nAnd when it's for the field,\nI wanna choose the actual message field.\n\n609\n00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.780\nBut notice I can look at date,\ntime, like host name.\n\n610\n00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:14.780\nIf I had log entries from dozens\nof hosts across my network, and\n\n611\n00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.750\nI need to see just the entries for\nfile sever two, I can put its name or\n\n612\n00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.280\nits IP address in here and\ncreate a filter.\n\n613\n00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.650\nAll of my events from a single host so\nI can't really use that.\n\n614\n00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:29.510\nSo, I'm just gonna use something\nwithin the message, time-based.\n\n615\n00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:33.608\nIt is case sensitive, by the way,\nwhen you're doing this kind of thing.\n\n616\n00:32:33.608 --> 00:32:36.900\nI'll click OK and nothing happened.\n\n617\n00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:42.255\nWhy did you not actually apply?\n\n618\n00:32:42.255 --> 00:32:45.718\nAll right, let's try that again,\nbecause Michael forgot to check it.\n\n619\n00:32:45.718 --> 00:32:47.926\nThere's a little check mark over here and\n\n620\n00:32:47.926 --> 00:32:51.000\nthat's how you can turn those rules on and\noff.\n\n621\n00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.502\nSo, I'm going to turn it on and\nclick Apply, and then OK, and there we go.\n\n622\n00:32:56.502 --> 00:32:59.989\nI can see that now that message\njumps right out at me, right?\n\n623\n00:32:59.989 --> 00:33:02.270\nMakes it a lot easier to find errors, or\n\n624\n00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:06.440\nin this case just events that had\nthe word time-based in there.\n\n625\n00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:11.360\nSo again, being able to do\nlog review means I want to\n\n626\n00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.040\nget all my log files, and\nthen I need to be able to analyze them.\n\n627\n00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.582\nLook for particular things within them,\n\n628\n00:33:17.582 --> 00:33:22.239\nsee what's going on on the network\ndoing our environment reconnaissance.\n\n629\n00:33:22.239 --> 00:33:26.849\nAnd this is just one of the many tools\nyou can use to support doing that,\n\n630\n00:33:26.849 --> 00:33:29.050\nin this case, Kiwi Syslog.\n\n631\n00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:33.950\nThere's dozens of others,\nWindows and Linux as well.\n\n632\n00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.229\nAnd that I think covers\neverything about our for now.\n\n633\n00:33:37.229 --> 00:33:40.171\nLike I say, we'll go maybe\na little more in-depth later when\n\n634\n00:33:40.171 --> 00:33:44.580\nwe're really looking at what's in here and\nwhat I can do with that information.\n\n635\n00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.680\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike,\nwell that's a lot of great information.\n\n636\n00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.330\nNow do we have more in this one,\nwe're go into a part three?\n\n637\n00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:50.964\nOr we're gonna ahead and\nwe'll hold that for\n\n638\n00:33:50.964 --> 00:33:52.696\nsome topics coming up in\nsome future episodes?\n\n639\n00:33:52.696 --> 00:33:54.015\n&gt;&gt; Nope, we do have a little more to go.\n\n640\n00:33:54.015 --> 00:33:57.902\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good, well, you know\nwhat, that makes a great place to go\n\n641\n00:33:57.902 --> 00:34:01.701\nahead and stop this one, Mike,\nas always we appreciate you being here.\n\n642\n00:34:01.701 --> 00:34:04.514\nYou guys that are tuning in,\nmake sure that you come back and\n\n643\n00:34:04.514 --> 00:34:08.365\nsee us in a part three, signing out for\nITProTV, I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n644\n00:34:08.365 --> 00:34:09.051\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n645\n00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:11.115\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:13.680\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.130\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.470\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.240\nin today's episode we are back\nwith more of our CSA+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.720\nAnd, of course, joining us in the studio,\nthe man who's lending his expertise on\n\n9\n00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.580\nthat very topic, our good friend,\nour mentor, Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.900\nMike, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.900\n&gt;&gt; Going fantastic Daniel,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.660\nExcited to be here a always\ndoing our CSA for Comp TIA.\n\n13\n00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.890\nSo in this episode we're gonna\nlook at a few different things.\n\n14\n00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.010\nWe have some terminology and some concepts\nwe need to be familiar with for the exam.\n\n15\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.300\nAnd I wanna start out just\nkinda diving right into it.\n\n16\n00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.310\nI wanna look at what we call talking about\ndoing analysis and looking at the results\n\n17\n00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.970\nof some of the tools we'll be using,\nfor example with network recognizance.\n\n18\n00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.840\nAnd one of the things they call it\nis point in time data analysis.\n\n19\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.410\nAnd when we're doing point in\ntime data analysis, I mean, that.\n\n20\n00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.430\nAnd the name kind of tells\nus what we're doing, right.\n\n21\n00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.380\nPoint in time means we're gonna grab\na slice of information from a particular\n\n22\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.600\ntime period and\nlook at that and analyze that.\n\n23\n00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.110\nSo we're not getting the big picture,\nright,\n\n24\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.590\nwe're getting a very\nspecific slice of time.\n\n25\n00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.810\nFor example, if you run a packet\ncapture utility right, you're\n\n26\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.510\ngetting packets from a specific point in\ntime wherever you started at 8 o' clock,\n\n27\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.680\nlet it run for an hour.\n\n28\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.180\nOr you capture packets an hour in\nthe morning and an hour in the afternoon.\n\n29\n00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.360\nOr an hour a day all week long or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n30\n00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.050\nYou're grabbing those\nspecific points in time.\n\n31\n00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.610\nAnd when we're doing our analysis,\npacket analysis,\n\n32\n00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.670\nwhat kind of things might we be looking\nfor when we're looking at packet analysis?\n\n33\n00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.290\nWell, think about what information you\nget back when you run one of those\n\n34\n00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.590\npacket capture utilities like Wireshark or\ntcpdump or something like that.\n\n35\n00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.550\nWe're getting those packets.\n\n36\n00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.110\nIn those packets we have\na lot of information.\n\n37\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.350\nWe have source and\ndestination information,\n\n38\n00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.110\nwhere that traffic is coming from,\nwhere it's destined for.\n\n39\n00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.090\nWe have protocol information\nwe gain out of there.\n\n40\n00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.920\nWhat protocols are being\nused on our network?\n\n41\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.550\nWhat percentage of different\nprotocols are being used?\n\n42\n00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.510\nWe can determine that.\n\n43\n00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.510\nWe can also start looking at the payloads,\n\n44\n00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.070\nif it's plain text we can\nread those payloads, right.\n\n45\n00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.260\nSo we can get a lot of\ninformation out of there.\n\n46\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.640\nProtocol analysis, they mention a few\nhere, protocol analysis, traffic analysis,\n\n47\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.260\nnet flow analysis and wireless analysis\nand there's some overlap between them.\n\n48\n00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.205\nWhen we talk about protocol analysis,\nwhat are we looking at?\n\n49\n00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:40.580\nWhat's protocol?\n\n50\n00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.110\nProtocol is a series of rules\nthat define how we speak,\n\n51\n00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.330\nlike GCP is a protocol for communication.\n\n52\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.180\nSMTP would be a protocol.\n\n53\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.750\nSo, a protocol's just a set of rules.\n\n54\n00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.760\nIt's kinda like a language.\n\n55\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.840\nThat's the way I always\nlike to think of it.\n\n56\n00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.480\nIt's a language.\n\n57\n00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.950\nAs long as both ends are speaking the same\nprotocol, we should be able to communicate\n\n58\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.340\nwith each other cuz we're\nfollowing that set of rules.\n\n59\n00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.780\nWhen we do protocol analysis,\nwhat are we looking at?\n\n60\n00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.530\nWell, we're looking to see what\nprotocols are being used on our network.\n\n61\n00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.780\nWhy?\nWhat is that gonna gain me?\n\n62\n00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.880\nWhat is that gonna do for\nme as far as security goes and\n\n63\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.330\nwhat is that gonna gain me?\n\n64\n00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.704\nI don't think that's proper English.\n\n65\n00:03:17.704 --> 00:03:21.129\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why am I doing this?\n\n66\n00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.970\nWhat is the purpose of\ndoing protocol analysis?\n\n67\n00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.960\nWell to see what protocols exist\nare being used on your network.\n\n68\n00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.050\nYou should have an idea of what\nprotocols are being used, right?\n\n69\n00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.360\nThere's obviously a few we\nknow are gonna be there,\n\n70\n00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.200\nTCP and DNS and things like this,\nthose are gonna be there.\n\n71\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.330\nBut when you start seeing protocols\nthat you're not familiar with or\n\n72\n00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.930\nmaybe shouldn't be there.\n\n73\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.940\nThat's gonna be my indicator that I\nneed to do a little more research and\n\n74\n00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.820\nfigure out what is going on.\n\n75\n00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.720\nMaybe it's legitimate, maybe somebody's\nusing an application that we're unaware of\n\n76\n00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.520\nand it's perfectly acceptable or\nmaybe it's not right.\n\n77\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.620\nMaybe it's something that\nshouldn't be on my network.\n\n78\n00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.720\nWe wouldn't know it if we weren't\ndoing any protocol analysis on there.\n\n79\n00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.811\n&gt;&gt; So your saying things like\nif I'm checking on my network,\n\n80\n00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:11.482\nI'm using one of these protocol\nanalyzers to do protocol analysis.\n\n81\n00:04:11.482 --> 00:04:16.820\nI see DHTP on a network with a different\nDHTP scope than what that's coming from.\n\n82\n00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.650\nThen I look into that packet,\n\n83\n00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.140\nsee it coming from a server\nthat's not our DHTP server.\n\n84\n00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.230\nWhile I know this is probably not good,\n\n85\n00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.850\nI need to trace this down,\nfigure out where it's coming from.\n\n86\n00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.100\nAnd see why DHCP is\nhappening when it shouldn't.\n\n87\n00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.120\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, right.\n\n88\n00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.270\nOr what if you see FTP traffic\nfloating around on your network, and\n\n89\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.950\nyou know that you don't use FTP for\nanything in your network?\n\n90\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.710\nVery well could be somebody,\ndo you want some data exfiltration or\n\n91\n00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.870\nmoving some data off your network using,\na lot of the bad guys,\n\n92\n00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.680\nthat's how they get the information\nout of your network.\n\n93\n00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.830\nSo looking at the protocols, understanding\nwhat's going on your network,\n\n94\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.930\nthat gives you a good idea of\nwhat's happening, and it's that\n\n95\n00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.720\nfirst indicator that maybe something\nis there that shouldn't be there.\n\n96\n00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.310\nTraffic analysis,\nhow to differentiate between protocol and\n\n97\n00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.650\ntraffic analysis to be honest when you're\nlooking a traffic analysis really I would\n\n98\n00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.840\nsay probably what they're trying to say\nthere is that would looking at the overall\n\n99\n00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.460\ntraffic and we're looking at the amounts\nof the different protocols that are there.\n\n100\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.510\nAnd so we're starting to see,\nwell, there's just a lot of\n\n101\n00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.530\nstreaming video protocols, streaming video\ntraffic that maybe shouldn't be there.\n\n102\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.820\nAre we doing conference calls or\n\n103\n00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.252\nis somebody watching Hulu or something\nlike that on their desktop at work?\n\n104\n00:05:34.252 --> 00:05:36.980\nWhen we look at traffic analysis we're\ntrying to look at the different types of\n\n105\n00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.640\ntraffic that are occurring.\n\n106\n00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.370\nWe might do this simply to set up to QoS\nor we do at you know quality of service so\n\n107\n00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.950\nwe can prioritize certain types of traffic\nor we might be doing it again looking for\n\n108\n00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.830\nsomething that shouldn't be there.\n\n109\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.310\nBut the important thing is to make sure\nwe know what should be there otherwise we\n\n110\n00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.340\nwon't be able to determine what\nshouldn't be there, right?\n\n111\n00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.230\nNetFlow analysis is one they\nkinda sticks out from the others.\n\n112\n00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.730\nWhen we talk about packet protocol,\ntraffic,\n\n113\n00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.825\nI mean you take, I don't know,\nWireshark, right?\n\n114\n00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:11.810\nWireshark, this packet capture\nutility that does all three.\n\n115\n00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.140\nWhen we're talking about packet\nprotocol or traffic analysis,\n\n116\n00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.840\nI can do any one of those with\nthat packet capture utility.\n\n117\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.560\nSo it's not like there's different\ntools to do each one of those things.\n\n118\n00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.360\nAlthough there can be some that\nare better at it than others.\n\n119\n00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.480\nI remember, trying to think of\nthe name of this program I used,\n\n120\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.440\nit was a protocol analyzer.\n\n121\n00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.490\nAnd it didn't give you any details.\n\n122\n00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.020\nBut it showed you this\npretty pie chart with\n\n123\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.680\nthe protocols that were on your network.\n\n124\n00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.260\nAnd so it was just a quick overview,\nit wasn't meant you give you details.\n\n125\n00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.190\nThat's all it did was look at the\nprotocols, it was basically packet capture\n\n126\n00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.480\nutility but you run a filter on there that\njust show you certain information and\n\n127\n00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.900\nthe application,\nit was graphing it out for you.\n\n128\n00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.405\nSo the point is, yeah,\nmost of these tools can do any of those.\n\n129\n00:06:54.405 --> 00:06:56.660\nBut NetFlow is a little different.\n\n130\n00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.590\nNetFlow is something we need to\nbe familiar for this exam and\n\n131\n00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.766\nit is a system proprietary protocol.\n\n132\n00:07:03.766 --> 00:07:08.420\nAlthough I was reading somewhere that\naccording to this one thing that I read,\n\n133\n00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.455\nthat it doesn't show up under Cisco's,\n\n134\n00:07:10.455 --> 00:07:16.330\nwhat's the term I'm looking for\nbrain cramp here.\n\n135\n00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.270\nCopyrights.\n\n136\n00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.120\nIt's not under Cisco's copyrights anymore.\n\n137\n00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.350\nBut that article could have been wrong or\nCisco might have changed to it's under, so\n\n138\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.000\nI would assume it's still\na Cisco proprietary.\n\n139\n00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.384\nBut basically NetFlow is [COUGH]\na way to monitor information\n\n140\n00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:34.450\ncoming off of routers and switches.\n\n141\n00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.340\nAgain, it started out as\na propriety thing with Cisco.\n\n142\n00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.560\nOther vendors have developed\nvery similar things.\n\n143\n00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.857\nJuniper has their JFlow for example.\n\n144\n00:07:43.857 --> 00:07:49.072\nHP I think has sFlow and you can get\nsome different NetFlow analyzers that\n\n145\n00:07:49.072 --> 00:07:54.819\ncan accept actually multiple protocols,\nbut NetFlow is really a Cisco thing.\n\n146\n00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:58.804\nBut it's basically pulling\nin data from my routers and\n\n147\n00:07:58.804 --> 00:08:02.529\nmy switches and\naccumulating that information and\n\n148\n00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:06.708\nallowing me to aggregate and\nanalyze that information.\n\n149\n00:08:06.708 --> 00:08:09.080\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n150\n00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.445\nA lot of information can be gleaned\nfrom looking at those logs,\n\n151\n00:08:12.445 --> 00:08:14.065\nlooking at the information.\n\n152\n00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:18.130\nIn routers for example, your firewalls,\nthey see everything, right?\n\n153\n00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.150\nI mean everything that is coming in,\n\n154\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.080\nhopefully everything is coming into\nyour network is going through that\n\n155\n00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:22.590\nfirewall unless somebody\nhas found a covert channel.\n\n156\n00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:27.490\nBut it gives me a chance\nto see what's in that,\n\n157\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.510\nI can actually go in and\nanalyze that information.\n\n158\n00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.030\nWireless analysis,\n\n159\n00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.260\nsame concept except now we're talking\nabout unbound media versus bound media.\n\n160\n00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.450\nMight be a different\nanalyzer that you use.\n\n161\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.750\nWireShark, for example, has plugins to\nwork with your wireless adapters, so\n\n162\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.410\nwe can capture wireless traffic\njust like it can wired traffic.\n\n163\n00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.620\nBut again, it is important data to\nmake sure that we are looking at.\n\n164\n00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:58.560\nData correlation and analytics, again some\nmore terms that we wanna be familiar with.\n\n165\n00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.150\nAnd some of these also have a little\nbit of a grey area to them.\n\n166\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.706\nBut we talk about anomaly analysis, trend,\n\n167\n00:09:05.706 --> 00:09:10.395\navailability, heuristic and\nbehavioral, behavioral?\n\n168\n00:09:10.395 --> 00:09:10.906\n&gt;&gt; Behavioral.\n\n169\n00:09:10.906 --> 00:09:12.070\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n170\n00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.680\n&gt;&gt; I'm just making-\n\n171\n00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.370\n&gt;&gt; You're butchering on\n\n172\n00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.540\nthe English language today.\n\n173\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.190\n&gt;&gt; So did I tell you that\nEnglish is my second language?\n\n174\n00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.745\nAnd if you believe that now.\n\n175\n00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:24.230\n[LAUGH] And we look at, for\nexample, anomaly analysis.\n\n176\n00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.220\nWhat we're looking for,\n\n177\n00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.700\nwe're analyzing things that\nare anomalies on a network, right?\n\n178\n00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.100\nLooking for things that stick out,\nthat don't normally happen and\n\n179\n00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.690\naren't normally there.\n\n180\n00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.590\nIt pops up on our radar, we wanna take\na look at that and see what caused it,\n\n181\n00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.420\nwhere it came from, what it might be.\n\n182\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.514\nWe look at trend analysis.\n\n183\n00:09:40.514 --> 00:09:44.414\nNow we're typically looking at\nhistorical data over time and\n\n184\n00:09:44.414 --> 00:09:47.030\nwe're looking for trends, right.\n\n185\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:53.200\nWe see that the amount of FTP traffic has\ngone up gradually over the last month.\n\n186\n00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.190\nIs that because we've implemented some\nnew program that uses FTP and more and\n\n187\n00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.350\nmore users are starting to use it?\n\n188\n00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.923\nOr is it because the bad guys are in our\nnetwork and they're using FTP to move data\n\n189\n00:10:03.923 --> 00:10:08.241\nout, and they're getting better or\nthey're getting more and more data.\n\n190\n00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:12.960\nSo looking at trends, looking at\nfailed logon attempts for example.\n\n191\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.750\nI see this spike in port scans\non the outside of our network.\n\n192\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.110\nNow that's the kind of thing we look for.\n\n193\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.540\nIt's like wow, there's an unusual\namount of scans going on,\n\n194\n00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.160\nwhat's changed, what can I do about it,\nso looking at trends.\n\n195\n00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.805\n&gt;&gt; Mike, with these analytics that we're\nlooking at, typically we'll have to have\n\n196\n00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:33.370\na baseline already in which to compare and\ncontrast with.\n\n197\n00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.330\nIs that not correct?\n\n198\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.910\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nit's very important to have a baseline.\n\n199\n00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.040\nAnd I know we've talked about that.\n\n200\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.960\nBecause without a baseline\neverything is relative.\n\n201\n00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.510\nAn anomaly is not an anomaly.\n\n202\n00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.430\nIf you don't know what your baseline is.\n\n203\n00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.110\nHow can you say that it shouldn't be\nthere if you don't know what's there or\n\n204\n00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.320\nwhat's normally there, right?\n\n205\n00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.310\nSo you have to have a baseline.\n\n206\n00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.890\nAvailability analysis.\n\n207\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.920\nHonestly, CompTIA, I'm not exactly\nsure where you're going with this one,\n\n208\n00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.680\nbut availability is obviously\na very important part of security.\n\n209\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.230\nWe talked about in everything.\n\n210\n00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.380\nWe talk about it in the CIA triad, right?\n\n211\n00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.940\nConfidentiality, integrity and\navailability.\n\n212\n00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.330\nWithout availability,\nour little three legged stool falls over.\n\n213\n00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.390\nResources are no good.\n\n214\n00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.860\nThey could be very confidential.\n\n215\n00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.910\nWe could have them encrypted to the nines.\n\n216\n00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:24.310\nThey could be verified\nthat they have integrity.\n\n217\n00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.610\nWe've got hashes running on all of them,\nbut\n\n218\n00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.590\nif my users can't get to them,\nthey don't do me any good.\n\n219\n00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.320\nGreat, they're protected, but\nnobody can get to them, so\n\n220\n00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.390\nthey're not gonna do me any good at all.\n\n221\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.350\nSo availability is a very important part.\n\n222\n00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.249\nAnd so\nwhen we talk about availability analysis,\n\n223\n00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.580\nit could be from that data standpoint,\nare the resources available?\n\n224\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.030\nIt could be from an end\npoint standpoint or\n\n225\n00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.430\na website standpoint,\nis the website available?\n\n226\n00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.380\nHow much uptime do we actually have?\n\n227\n00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.110\nThis is very important, especially if\nyou're say, an e-commerce site, right.\n\n228\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.540\nAny downtime is going to cost you money\nwhen it comes to selling your product\n\n229\n00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.730\n&gt;&gt; So when they say availability,\n\n230\n00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.930\nthey could be from any one of\nthose vectors or all of them.\n\n231\n00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.890\nPer say, could be,\nam I able to get to my website internally?\n\n232\n00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.490\nAm I able to get to my website externally?\n\n233\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.990\nHow long has that website been up?\n\n234\n00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.270\nIs there any downtime?\n\n235\n00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.510\nLet's figure those things out, put them\ninto real numbers that we can quantify,\n\n236\n00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.280\nand then take a look and\n\n237\n00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.850\nsee, we've had more downtime this\nyear by 2% more than last year.\n\n238\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.230\nAnd now well, let's figure out why\nthat's happening and move from there.\n\n239\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.900\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n240\n00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.210\nAnd it is an important part of,\n\n241\n00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.960\nAIT is really about saying what\ndo you mean by this CompTIA.\n\n242\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.430\nBut it is an important part.\n\n243\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.460\nWe've gotta make sure that we are paying\nattention to that because as I said,\n\n244\n00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.880\nif those resources aren't available,\nwhether that's a publicly available\n\n245\n00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.280\nresource or\nan internally available resource.\n\n246\n00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.610\nIf my users or\nmy customers have to wait or\n\n247\n00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.260\nif they get periods of time when they're\nnot available, especially customers,\n\n248\n00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.390\nthey're not gonna come back, they're gonna\nfind somebody else that is available when\n\n249\n00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:58.130\nthey decide to click on that link and\ngo buy products.\n\n250\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.770\nSo important that we're\nmonitoring that availability.\n\n251\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:06.060\nIt also might be from a, we might be\nthe customer side of things, right?\n\n252\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.840\nIf I'm outsourcing,\nwhich is very common nowadays, we've got\n\n253\n00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.350\nall the different Azure services,\neverything is moving out to the Cloud.\n\n254\n00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:14.652\nWell now all of a sudden,\n\n255\n00:13:14.652 --> 00:13:18.560\nI'm relying on somebody else to make\nsure these resources are available.\n\n256\n00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.410\nSo I've gotta mind my SLAs, right?\n\n257\n00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.500\nI've gotta make sure I\nunderstand what's in there.\n\n258\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.070\nAnd I've got to monitor them.\n\n259\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.560\nMost vendors are honest and if they\nhave a downtime, they'll notify you.\n\n260\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.780\nBut what if they're not.\n\n261\n00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.115\nWe gotta make sure that we're keeping\ntrack of that, making sure they're\n\n262\n00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:38.626\nfulfilling their end of contract and\nproviding that level of uptime.\n\n263\n00:13:38.626 --> 00:13:42.339\nHeuristics and behavioral analysis.\n\n264\n00:13:42.339 --> 00:13:43.306\nI don't know why I can't\nsay that word today.\n\n265\n00:13:43.306 --> 00:13:44.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wanna fill some\n\n266\n00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:46.145\nextra syllables in there.\n\n267\n00:13:46.145 --> 00:13:49.735\nBut heuristics and behavioral.\n\n268\n00:13:49.735 --> 00:13:53.956\nThese, I've always had a little bit of\ndifficulty kinda defining the difference,\n\n269\n00:13:53.956 --> 00:13:55.038\nbut let's attempt.\n\n270\n00:13:55.038 --> 00:13:57.296\nWhen we talk about heuristics.\n\n271\n00:13:57.296 --> 00:14:01.676\nHeuristics is really a way\nof looking at something and\n\n272\n00:14:01.676 --> 00:14:06.172\nseeing how it's working\nwhich sounds like behavior.\n\n273\n00:14:06.172 --> 00:14:09.700\n[LAUGH] It's like wait,\nhow is it behaving,\n\n274\n00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.280\nI'm trying not to use that\nword when I define it.\n\n275\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:19.370\nLet's back up for a second,\nthe big difference between heuristics and\n\n276\n00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:26.560\nbehavioral is that heuristics still works\non definitions, just like say a signature.\n\n277\n00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.925\nLet's take antivirus for example.\n\n278\n00:14:27.925 --> 00:14:31.424\nWhen we look at anti-virus and\nwe look at heuristics,\n\n279\n00:14:31.424 --> 00:14:35.645\nit's still looking at definitions and\nsignatures files.\n\n280\n00:14:35.645 --> 00:14:38.795\nThe difference between that and\njust a standard signature AV,\n\n281\n00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:42.685\nantivirus program, is that heuristics\nmight actually take some code and\n\n282\n00:14:42.685 --> 00:14:45.955\nexecute it in a little sandbox\nenvironment, and see what the results are.\n\n283\n00:14:45.955 --> 00:14:48.625\nSee what that output is and\nlook at that for known signatures.\n\n284\n00:14:48.625 --> 00:14:52.215\nLike, that behavior right\nthere is a known signature.\n\n285\n00:14:52.215 --> 00:14:55.245\nBut, your normal AV might not have\nseen it because it's not gonna execute\n\n286\n00:14:55.245 --> 00:14:55.805\nthe code, right.\n\n287\n00:14:55.805 --> 00:15:00.050\nIt's just looking at the code itself and\nseeing if it matches the signature.\n\n288\n00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.810\nAnd then yes or no to that.\n\n289\n00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:07.090\nHeuristics is where it has a little\ninternal sandbox environment,\n\n290\n00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:11.345\nor it sends it out to the cloud\nto be analyzed or executed.\n\n291\n00:15:11.345 --> 00:15:16.380\n[COUGH] And then, we look at the behaviors\nand the output from that execution.\n\n292\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.595\nAnd we look at that and\nsee if that matches any definitions or\n\n293\n00:15:19.595 --> 00:15:22.248\nanything that's a known\nmalware-type thing.\n\n294\n00:15:22.248 --> 00:15:26.415\nWhereas behavioral is really\nlooking at behaviors where, and\n\n295\n00:15:26.415 --> 00:15:31.620\nthat's pretty as like well,\nMike thank you for that wonderful insight.\n\n296\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.840\nBut its not based on signatures, right?\n\n297\n00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:40.320\nWhen we look at behavioral analysis, we're\ntalking about the way things behave and\n\n298\n00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:45.710\nit takes time for behavioral systems\nto build up its own base line.\n\n299\n00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.231\nIt has to know what's there,\nwhat's normal.\n\n300\n00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:53.312\nWe see this amount of traffic every\nmorning and big spikes during log on\n\n301\n00:15:53.312 --> 00:15:58.670\nperiod [INAUDIBLE] Coming in to work or,\nwhat's another example of that?\n\n302\n00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.180\nI am trying to think, video conference.\n\n303\n00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.486\nJust it starts to pick up on these\ndifferent behaviors of things that\n\n304\n00:16:03.486 --> 00:16:05.440\nnormally occur on your network.\n\n305\n00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.620\nAnd then when it sees things\nthat are not normally there,\n\n306\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.080\nwhen it sees a different\nbehavior it's gonna set an alarm.\n\n307\n00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.897\nBut the key here is to understand\nthat they don't know what's good and\n\n308\n00:16:14.897 --> 00:16:15.710\nwhat's bad.\n\n309\n00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.500\n&gt;&gt; So it has to learn\nthe behavior of the system first.\n\n310\n00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.708\nIt has to sit back, watch,\ngather information, and say, okay.\n\n311\n00:16:22.708 --> 00:16:26.413\nNow after x amount of time we've decided\nthat that is how long it takes for\n\n312\n00:16:26.413 --> 00:16:28.866\nyou to learn the behavior\nof the normal system.\n\n313\n00:16:28.866 --> 00:16:30.208\nNothing has occurred.\n\n314\n00:16:30.208 --> 00:16:32.440\nAnd now you could take\nthat into account and\n\n315\n00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.043\nanything that works outside of that\ni s gonna get flagged as an alert.\n\n316\n00:16:36.043 --> 00:16:39.404\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nit can be a tedious process.\n\n317\n00:16:39.404 --> 00:16:43.372\nBecause you're gonna get false positives\nall day long in the beginning,\n\n318\n00:16:43.372 --> 00:16:46.069\nas it's learning what\nthe normal behaviors are.\n\n319\n00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:47.191\nAnd it goes beyond antivirus.\n\n320\n00:16:47.191 --> 00:16:51.390\nOur intrusion detection systems,\nintrusion prevention systems,\n\n321\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.020\nthey can be behavioral versus\nheuristics as well, right?\n\n322\n00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.456\nSo it's not just the antivirus software.\n\n323\n00:16:57.456 --> 00:17:01.558\nAll right, and then we've got all\nkinds of output that we need to make\n\n324\n00:17:01.558 --> 00:17:04.196\nsure we're aware of that we are analyzing.\n\n325\n00:17:04.196 --> 00:17:07.127\nFirewall logs,\nmentioned this already a couple of times.\n\n326\n00:17:07.127 --> 00:17:11.986\nFirewalls are typically very,\nvery capable at logging.\n\n327\n00:17:11.986 --> 00:17:14.194\nIt's one of their primary\nresponsibilities.\n\n328\n00:17:14.194 --> 00:17:16.192\nProbably just second to allowing or\n\n329\n00:17:16.192 --> 00:17:20.630\nblocking traffic is logging\neverything that's coming in and out.\n\n330\n00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.296\nNow, you have to make sure you have\nconfigured the logging properly\n\n331\n00:17:24.296 --> 00:17:25.338\non those devices.\n\n332\n00:17:25.338 --> 00:17:28.599\nYou don't want them to\nrun out of disk space.\n\n333\n00:17:28.599 --> 00:17:31.150\nYou don't want them to\nstart overriding entries,\n\n334\n00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.030\nif you try to make that log file too\nshort and you're doing circular logging.\n\n335\n00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:40.130\nYou end up overwriting older entries\nwith first in first out type thing and\n\n336\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.200\nwe lose information.\n\n337\n00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.910\nSo we wanna make sure\nthat it's set up properly\n\n338\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.649\nto move those log files off as necessary.\n\n339\n00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.980\nBut just a huge amount of information that\nwe're gonna get out of our firewall logs.\n\n340\n00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:56.190\nBecause you're gonna see there are\nconnections that are being established.\n\n341\n00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.530\nFiles that are moving in and out.\n\n342\n00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.565\nData that's moving in and out.\n\n343\n00:17:59.565 --> 00:18:02.100\nConnections from the outside,\nconnections from the inside.\n\n344\n00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.190\nConnections that were blocked, even.\n\n345\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.820\nNow these are gonna be things that\nyou might not see internally,\n\n346\n00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.630\nbecause it was never allowed\nto get past that firewall.\n\n347\n00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.736\nAll these scan attempts on\nthe outside of your firewall.\n\n348\n00:18:12.736 --> 00:18:18.120\nAgain, attempted connections made from the\noutside with invalid private IP addresses,\n\n349\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.950\ntrying to come in from the outside.\n\n350\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.420\nWe've got rules in place on our\nfirewall that are blocking those.\n\n351\n00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.720\nAnd we need to look for\nthe log information.\n\n352\n00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.600\nPacket captures,\nanother wealth of information there.\n\n353\n00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.750\nWe've shown you Wireshark,\nI think we look at tcpdump.\n\n354\n00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.630\nAs I said,\nyou're seeing the raw packet information.\n\n355\n00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.770\nSo everything's in there,\nfrom your header information,\n\n356\n00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.820\nfrom TCP, your source and destination.\n\n357\n00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.510\nYou MAC addresses,\nyour protocol that's being used.\n\n358\n00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.180\nThe flags that are set on those packets,\nthe payload, the trailer.\n\n359\n00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.340\nAll of that is valuable information.\n\n360\n00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:56.382\nSo we need to be able to go in and\nanalyze that information, what else?\n\n361\n00:18:56.382 --> 00:19:00.974\nEnd map scan results, again,\na great source of information, and\n\n362\n00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:04.009\nnot just for the attacker or\nthe pen tester.\n\n363\n00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:06.210\nI mean we should scan our\nnetworks periodically.\n\n364\n00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:10.450\nThis should be part of our\nroutine security, why?\n\n365\n00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:13.250\nDaniel, why would I scan\nmy network periodically?\n\n366\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.880\n&gt;&gt; To me it's the same reason you\nwalk through your house every so\n\n367\n00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.710\noften to make sure all\nthe windows are locked.\n\n368\n00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.660\nYou're just verifying that yeah, they\nare locked just like the last time and\n\n369\n00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.000\nthey are locked just like\nthe last time before that.\n\n370\n00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.560\nOne day you don't wanna walk to your\nhouse and go, this window is unlocked.\n\n371\n00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.470\nI didn't unlock it, why is it unlocked?\n\n372\n00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.680\nYou asked your significant other,\ndid you unlock it?\n\n373\n00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.060\nNo, I didn't unlock that.\n\n374\n00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.670\nThe kids, did you guys unlock it?\n\n375\n00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:37.662\nAnd they go, not us.\n\n376\n00:19:37.662 --> 00:19:41.220\nOkay, and that's an indication\nthat something is happening.\n\n377\n00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.713\nSo maybe somebody has started a service\nthat normally should not be started.\n\n378\n00:19:44.713 --> 00:19:48.632\nThings of that nature, so\nyou periodically run things like Nmap.\n\n379\n00:19:48.632 --> 00:19:52.129\nSo that you can just verify that the lay\nof the land is looking like it's\n\n380\n00:19:52.129 --> 00:19:52.980\nsupposed to.\n\n381\n00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.882\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, people install applications,\n\n382\n00:19:55.882 --> 00:20:00.420\nespecially if your end users\nhave administrative rights.\n\n383\n00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.123\nAnd even the people that\nshould be installing software,\n\n384\n00:20:03.123 --> 00:20:06.293\nthat do have the permissions to\ninstall software, your IT staff.\n\n385\n00:20:06.293 --> 00:20:10.136\nThey're installing software and\nyou miss things or it has some kind of,\n\n386\n00:20:10.136 --> 00:20:12.218\nI'm trying to think of a good example.\n\n387\n00:20:12.218 --> 00:20:16.245\nThat has some other thing in the\nbackground that they didn't know about t\n\n388\n00:20:16.245 --> 00:20:17.374\nhat got installed.\n\n389\n00:20:17.374 --> 00:20:20.355\nThe point is, as Daniel said,\nwe can't take for\n\n390\n00:20:20.355 --> 00:20:23.857\ngranted that what we had\nyesterday is still there today.\n\n391\n00:20:23.857 --> 00:20:27.210\nAnd that everything that wasn't there\nyesterday is still not there today.\n\n392\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.860\nWe need to be doing this periodically.\n\n393\n00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.485\nWe're looking for where the service\ngot turned on accidentally.\n\n394\n00:20:32.485 --> 00:20:35.801\nAnd now that server's sitting there\nlistening on ports 20 and 21 or\n\n395\n00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:37.024\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n396\n00:20:37.024 --> 00:20:41.826\nOr somebody installed some\nVMWare on their workstation,\n\n397\n00:20:41.826 --> 00:20:44.475\nand it's now offering up DHCP.\n\n398\n00:20:44.475 --> 00:20:46.951\nOr somebody installed\na rogue access point.\n\n399\n00:20:46.951 --> 00:20:50.094\nNot only looking for\nservices that shouldn't be there,\n\n400\n00:20:50.094 --> 00:20:51.870\nports that shouldn't be open.\n\n401\n00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.326\nOr ports that should be open that aren't,\nbut also looking for new devices, right?\n\n402\n00:20:55.326 --> 00:20:56.867\nLike rogue access points,\n\n403\n00:20:56.867 --> 00:21:01.425\nterminals that have plugged into the\nnetwork that shouldn't be there, right?\n\n404\n00:21:01.425 --> 00:21:06.228\nThese are the things I can find using\na program like Nmap to do just ping sweeps\n\n405\n00:21:06.228 --> 00:21:07.290\nperiodically.\n\n406\n00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.330\nLet me look for\nall the active hosts on the network and\n\n407\n00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.450\nsee what's going on out there.\n\n408\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike, then there's the awesome\nbuilt in tools that you have already in\n\n409\n00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.400\nyour operating system.\n\n410\n00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.942\nThings like the event logs.\n\n411\n00:21:17.942 --> 00:21:22.353\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, event log,\nWindows event logs are fantastic.\n\n412\n00:21:22.353 --> 00:21:25.141\nAnd all operating systems have logs.\n\n413\n00:21:25.141 --> 00:21:28.159\nYou look at your Linux boxes,\nyour Mac OSX,\n\n414\n00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:31.680\nall of these are gonna\nhave logging capabilities.\n\n415\n00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.377\nAnd depending on what OSs you're running\n\n416\n00:21:36.377 --> 00:21:38.560\non your network you need\nto be familiar with those.\n\n417\n00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.975\nAre you running a syslog system to\ncollect all the logs from your different\n\n418\n00:21:41.975 --> 00:21:43.440\nLinux servers?\n\n419\n00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.700\nAre you doing event log\nsubscriptions in Windows\n\n420\n00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.290\nto pull all those to a central location?\n\n421\n00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.130\nHow did we go about filtering those?\n\n422\n00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:54.650\nCuz they have great filtering\ncapabilities built in with Windows.\n\n423\n00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:59.105\nYou've got applications\nyou can use in Linux.\n\n424\n00:21:59.105 --> 00:22:03.711\nDaniel's been guiding me through\na lot of my Linux stuff.\n\n425\n00:22:03.711 --> 00:22:06.073\nAnd getting good with grep and\n\n426\n00:22:06.073 --> 00:22:10.555\nbeing able to find the pertinent\ninformation in there.\n\n427\n00:22:10.555 --> 00:22:14.636\nSyslogs as I mentioned is\nthe Cisco side of things.\n\n428\n00:22:14.636 --> 00:22:15.444\nDid I say Cisco?\n\n429\n00:22:15.444 --> 00:22:18.436\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Linux side of things, where we have,\n\n430\n00:22:18.436 --> 00:22:21.988\nit's just log server is where\nall the logs get sent to.\n\n431\n00:22:21.988 --> 00:22:23.890\n&gt;&gt; Well Cisco will connect\nto a syslog server.\n\n432\n00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.090\nSo it's not out of\nthe realm of possibilities.\n\n433\n00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.152\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I was talking about.\n\n434\n00:22:27.152 --> 00:22:28.982\nAnd then there's even a Windows client.\n\n435\n00:22:28.982 --> 00:22:33.180\nIf you wanted to talk to a syslog server,\nyou can get a client for Windows.\n\n436\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:38.260\nI haven't tried that, see how well that\none works, but they say it can be done.\n\n437\n00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.140\nAnd then IDS reports, right,\nyour intrusion detection systems.\n\n438\n00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:47.980\nEspecially intrusion detection, IPSs,\nintrusion prevention is just as important.\n\n439\n00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.600\nBut remember intrusion detection\ndoesn't do anything about it,\n\n440\n00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.205\nit just logs the fact that it happened.\n\n441\n00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:56.680\nSo you've got to make sure\nyou're reviewing those logs.\n\n442\n00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.890\nThose might be network based\nintrusions detection systems or NIDSs.\n\n443\n00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:05.320\nThey might be host based intrusion\ndetection systems, HIDSs.\n\n444\n00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.688\nNeed to make sure you're analyzing that.\n\n445\n00:23:07.688 --> 00:23:10.755\nAnd then lastly we'll talk about some\nof the tools that they call out here.\n\n446\n00:23:10.755 --> 00:23:18.370\nSIEM in general, S-I-E-M, is a way\nto centralize your log management.\n\n447\n00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:22.452\nIt pulls in information from\neverywhere on your network.\n\n448\n00:23:22.452 --> 00:23:25.660\nThere are several out there\nthat you can gain access to.\n\n449\n00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.512\nA lot of them have free trials.\n\n450\n00:23:29.512 --> 00:23:30.662\nAlien Vault, for example, is a big one.\n\n451\n00:23:30.662 --> 00:23:34.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's super nice cuz they\nget all those cool graphics.\n\n452\n00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.810\nYou get pie charts and graphs and bars and\n\n453\n00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.680\nthe whole nine yards and\nit looks really pretty.\n\n454\n00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.797\nIt's a really easy interface to work with.\n\n455\n00:23:41.797 --> 00:23:44.301\nI played around with\nAlien Vault a little bit and\n\n456\n00:23:44.301 --> 00:23:46.866\nit just makes that daily\ngrind of checking logs,\n\n457\n00:23:46.866 --> 00:23:50.638\nlooking at IDS stuff A whole lot easier,\nand a little more manageable.\n\n458\n00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:54.280\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nwe've talked several times about big data.\n\n459\n00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.300\nAnd this would be an example of big data.\n\n460\n00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.440\nWhen you start pulling all the data\nback from all of your network devices,\n\n461\n00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.200\nyour switches and your routers.\n\n462\n00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.890\nYour firewalls,\nyour intrusion detection systems.\n\n463\n00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:07.030\nAll of that stuff starts coming back.\n\n464\n00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.040\nLog files from your servers.\n\n465\n00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.060\nThat's a huge amount of data.\n\n466\n00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.390\nAnd having some way to work with that.\n\n467\n00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.750\nTo be able to work with\nthat in a meaningful way.\n\n468\n00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.770\nBeing able to do big data analytics.\n\n469\n00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.770\nThat's what SIEM allows you to do.\n\n470\n00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.000\nThere's free ones, OSSIM.\n\n471\n00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.840\nI'm trying to think of another one.\n\n472\n00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.880\nThere's many out there that\nyou can get access to.\n\n473\n00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.780\nPacket analyzers,\nWireshark is my favorite one.\n\n474\n00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.610\nDefinitely not the only one.\n\n475\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:43.361\nIntrusion detection systems,\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n476\n00:24:43.361 --> 00:24:44.180\nWhat else?\n\n477\n00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.250\nResource monitoring tools.\n\n478\n00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.060\nYeah, some of the good resource\nmonitors I've worked with.\n\n479\n00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:52.380\nObviously, things like Solar Lens, Orion.\n\n480\n00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.350\nThat thing is amazing.\n\n481\n00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.340\nIt costs a little bit of money but\nit is totally worth it.\n\n482\n00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.790\nAnd then there's the built in stuff.\n\n483\n00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.370\nYou think Windows has.\n\n484\n00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.180\nI think it's called the resource\nmonitor if I'm not mistaken.\n\n485\n00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.457\n[LAUGH].\nSo aptly named Microsoft, good job.\n\n486\n00:25:03.457 --> 00:25:05.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm assuming that's what\n\n487\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.050\nthey're talking about.\n\n488\n00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:06.604\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n489\n00:25:06.604 --> 00:25:08.449\nAnd I think you mentioned TOP, as well.\n\n490\n00:25:08.449 --> 00:25:09.828\nRight.\nIn a Linux environment,\n\n491\n00:25:09.828 --> 00:25:11.810\ntrying to see what's going on.\n\n492\n00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.490\nSo we're talking about\nresources on a single machine.\n\n493\n00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.020\nObviously very important.\n\n494\n00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.930\nMonitoring your virtualization servers,\nfor example.\n\n495\n00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.750\nBecause if I run low on resources, I could\nend up bringing down multiple servers.\n\n496\n00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.150\nNot just one.\n\n497\n00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.220\nResource monitors,\nas far as your entire network.\n\n498\n00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.200\nMaking sure that\nthe resources are available.\n\n499\n00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.195\nMaking sure that your, I don't know.\n\n500\n00:25:36.195 --> 00:25:38.645\nSeeing what's out there, just discovering.\n\n501\n00:25:38.645 --> 00:25:42.265\nYeah, SolarWinds is great when it makes\nthat nice graphical map of your network.\n\n502\n00:25:42.265 --> 00:25:44.345\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing.\n&gt;&gt; Again, costs you money, but hey.\n\n503\n00:25:44.345 --> 00:25:46.235\nYou get what you pay for.\n\n504\n00:25:46.235 --> 00:25:47.855\nNetFlow Analyzer is another one.\n\n505\n00:25:47.855 --> 00:25:49.701\nCisco makes NetFlow Analyzer.\n\n506\n00:25:49.701 --> 00:25:53.375\nWe talked about that.\n\n507\n00:25:53.375 --> 00:25:58.460\nSolarWinds, I'm sorry, actually makes\na NetFlow Analyzer that is free of charge.\n\n508\n00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.910\nThey've got a free one and a paid one.\n\n509\n00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:00.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nFluke works I think.\n\n510\n00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.425\nYou can buy the Fluke devices.\n\n511\n00:26:02.425 --> 00:26:03.581\nThose things are really cool.\n\n512\n00:26:03.581 --> 00:26:05.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those are some cash too, right?\n\n513\n00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.946\nYeah, a little bit.\n\n514\n00:26:06.946 --> 00:26:10.679\nWho doesn't want to walk around with\nsome flukes hanging off their sides?\n\n515\n00:26:10.679 --> 00:26:14.380\n[LAUGH] But, I completely forget\nwhere I was even going with that.\n\n516\n00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.240\nYeah, resource monitors.\n\n517\n00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.770\nThings like SolarWinds,\nplus our built-in ones.\n\n518\n00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.890\nNetFlow Analyzer,\nI think I was getting there.\n\n519\n00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:24.460\nThis is where we're pulling again that\ndata from our switches and our routers.\n\n520\n00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:28.770\nAnd it reminds me a lot like SNMP,\nyour simple network management protocol.\n\n521\n00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:29.780\nBut that's what you're doing.\n\n522\n00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.810\nYou're pulling back information that's\nbeing provided by these switches\n\n523\n00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:33.830\nand routers.\n\n524\n00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.780\nBringing it in for analysis.\n\n525\n00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.620\nSome way to summarize it, correlate it.\n\n526\n00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.010\nAnd then view it in a report.\n\n527\n00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.110\nSo, like I said,\n\n528\n00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:44.650\nyou can get some trial versions of\nsome of those NetFlow organizers.\n\n529\n00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:47.794\nThere are some free ones out there.\n\n530\n00:26:47.794 --> 00:26:50.450\nBut either way you go.\n\n531\n00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:51.170\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff.\n\n532\n00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:51.730\nAll right, Mike.\n\n533\n00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.750\nI think that about does it for\nnetwork reconnaissance.\n\n534\n00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.890\nAnd by the way, if you just want to have\na good time, try to spell reconnaissance.\n\n535\n00:26:58.890 --> 00:26:59.840\n[LAUGH] Without messing up.\n\n536\n00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.475\nBet your friends ten bucks they\ncan't do it on the first try.\n\n537\n00:27:02.475 --> 00:27:05.220\nBecause there's a lot of n's and\nc's and stuff going on there.\n\n538\n00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.890\nYeah.\n[LAUGH] It's an interesting word.\n\n539\n00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.090\nThat being said, it looks like we've\nrun out of time for this episode.\n\n540\n00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.860\nWe do thank you guys for joining us.\n\n541\n00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.050\nWe will be back with more CSA.\n\n542\n00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:14.890\nHopefully, you will join us there,\nas well.\n\n543\n00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.330\nAs for this one though, we're signing off.\n\n544\n00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.900\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n545\n00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:19.660\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n546\n00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.174\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n547\n00:27:22.174 --> 00:27:28.246\n[MUSIC]\n\n548\n00:27:28.246 --> 00:27:32.499\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV\n\n",

Coming to you live from San Francisco.\n\n4\n00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:12.570\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.150\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.430\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.280\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.310\nAnd in today's episode we are coming\nback with more of our CSA+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.810\nAnd, of course,\njoining us in the studio Is the man that's\n\n10\n00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.400\ntrying to guide us down this,\nwhat is it, a pedagogue, as it were.\n\n11\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.860\nOur good friend, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.650\nMike, welcome back sir.\n\n13\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.170\nHow goes it?\n\n14\n00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.110\n&gt;&gt; Well it's going great.\n\n15\n00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.092\nWord of the day, I'm gonna have to write\nthat one down and look it up later.\n\n16\n00:00:36.092 --> 00:00:37.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Awesome.\n\n17\n00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.440\n&gt;&gt; Great to be back.\n\n18\n00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.090\nI know, thanks for having me here.\n\n19\n00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.010\nContinuing on with our good old CSA,\nin this one,\n\n20\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.210\nwe wanna take a look at some of the\ndifferent counter-measures that we have\n\n21\n00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.370\navailable to mitigate some of the risks\nthat we have been talking about.\n\n22\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.160\nAnd the first one they call out on our set\nof objectives is network segmentation.\n\n23\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.850\nA couple of different ways\nwe can go about this,\n\n24\n00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.210\nyou know when we talk about\nsegmenting out of network, right?\n\n25\n00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.680\nWe're throwing in routers.\n\n26\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.500\nWe're taking our network and breaking it\ndown into smaller chunks doing subnetting.\n\n27\n00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:16.345\nBorrowing bits, that kind of thing.\n\n28\n00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:17.565\nWe don't want to get back into network.\n\n29\n00:01:17.565 --> 00:01:20.985\nPlus, but I know you guys are familiar\nwith that concept of subnetting.\n\n30\n00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:25.505\nAnd the idea is that it does\nmake it a little more difficult.\n\n31\n00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:27.955\nIf there's a router between two networks,\n\n32\n00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:32.195\nthat gives me the chance to do several\nthings, monitor at the minimum.\n\n33\n00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:35.085\nI can set rules that allow or deny so\n\n34\n00:01:35.085 --> 00:01:39.240\nI can control the traffic that's flowing,\nIn between those two networks.\n\n35\n00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.770\nSo beyond what we learned in Network+\nabout segmenting a network for\n\n36\n00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010\nbroadcast traffic and things like that.\n\n37\n00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.540\nNetwork segmentation has a real\nsecurity value, because again.\n\n38\n00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.080\nWe segment it by using routers,\n\n39\n00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.030\nand routers give me that control over\nthat traffic that's flowing through them.\n\n40\n00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.740\nAnd so system isolation, basically,\nis what we're talking about.\n\n41\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.260\nWe can have a subnet of just our\nbackbone servers, where we can\n\n42\n00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.100\nreally control what traffic is allowed to\ncome in and out of that particular subnet.\n\n43\n00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.010\nOur DMZ is another example of\nsegmenting out our network.\n\n44\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.050\nBecause I've got different requirements,\nright.\n\n45\n00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.410\nThat DMZ has of resources that need\nto be made available to the public.\n\n46\n00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.510\nI need anonymous access coming in to my\nwebsite so people can buy my product.\n\n47\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.080\nI don't need anonymous access\nin my corporate network.\n\n48\n00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.100\nAnd those web servers that\nhost my corporate calendars or\n\n49\n00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.930\nwhatever the case may be there.\n\n50\n00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.470\nSo by segregating that out, by putting\nthose out in that DMZ, I can now have\n\n51\n00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.180\ndifferent rules and different levels\nof access and divide that up.\n\n52\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.340\nAnd try to put things that have\nthe same security requirements in\n\n53\n00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.260\nthe same segments.\n\n54\n00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Mike even if let's say\nthe worst did happen as well,\n\n55\n00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.220\nit can also be a reactive\nthing that we do.\n\n56\n00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.030\nAll of a sudden,\nsomebody's computer gets a virus in HR,\n\n57\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.560\nwell now I can segment HR's traffic\ndown to maybe even just that one node,\n\n58\n00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.130\nif not, just their subnet so it doesn't\nspread to the rest of my networks.\n\n59\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.680\nI can just block that\noff using segmentation.\n\n60\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.460\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right that is a great point.\n\n61\n00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.122\nWe look at remediation\nservers where if we're using\n\n62\n00:03:15.122 --> 00:03:17.851\nsome technology that does\na health check on a system.\n\n63\n00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:21.075\nIf it fails at health check it kicks\nit out to that remediation portion of\n\n64\n00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:24.732\nthe network which is segregated off and\nnot allowed to access anything other than\n\n65\n00:03:24.732 --> 00:03:28.650\nthe remediation servers, so several\nplaces you'll see that technique used.\n\n66\n00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.970\nAnother one, a term we need jump box.\n\n67\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.530\nCompTIA says jump box,\nusually you'll hear jump server,\n\n68\n00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.490\nbut either way, it's just a six of one,\nhalf a dozen of another.\n\n69\n00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.888\nIs typically a machine that is in\na trusted network that is gonna be\n\n70\n00:03:43.888 --> 00:03:47.595\nused to manage devices\nIn an untrusted network.\n\n71\n00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:52.397\nLike when I need to remotely manage\nthose web services out there in my DMZ,\n\n72\n00:03:52.397 --> 00:03:55.572\nthe server that I set up\nto do that is the jump box,\n\n73\n00:03:55.572 --> 00:04:00.298\nit might be the only one that is actually\nallowed to go from the inside into\n\n74\n00:04:00.298 --> 00:04:03.192\nthat network to do those management tasks.\n\n75\n00:04:03.192 --> 00:04:05.010\nIt could be a physical machine.\n\n76\n00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.140\nIt could be a virtual machine\ndepending on what we're trying to do.\n\n77\n00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.460\nIf it's a physical box, very few people\nhave access to the physical machine.\n\n78\n00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.875\nOnly certain people are able to log on to\nthat, because that machine is hardened and\n\n79\n00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:19.895\nprotected, and\n\n80\n00:04:19.895 --> 00:04:23.035\nis able to go into that untrusted\nportion of the network and manage it.\n\n81\n00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:27.163\nThe worry is, that by reaching out into\nthat untrusted portion of the network and\n\n82\n00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:29.775\ndoing management tasks,\nI'm an administrator,\n\n83\n00:04:29.775 --> 00:04:33.679\nI mean I could catch something,\ninfect the system that I'm managing from.\n\n84\n00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:36.129\nAnd that machine is on the trusted\nportion of my network and\n\n85\n00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.825\nthereby releasing something\ninto my internal network.\n\n86\n00:04:38.825 --> 00:04:43.320\nCould be that segue or that way into\nthe network, which we don't want.\n\n87\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.700\nSo, it's typically a very hard machine,\n\n88\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.060\nvery few people are able\nto access the machine.\n\n89\n00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.210\nIf it's a virtual machine,\na lot of times we'll do personal\n\n90\n00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.800\nvirtual desktops or virtual desktop\ninfrastructure, VDI, something like that.\n\n91\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.480\nMaybe we spin up a new virtual\nmachine when you need to\n\n92\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.050\nremotely manage that system\nout there in the DMZ.\n\n93\n00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.470\nWhen you're done it gets blown away.\n\n94\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.300\nIf you need to manage again a new machine\nis spun up that has what you need\n\n95\n00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.900\nto go out there.\n\n96\n00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.930\nAnd that way nothing is left on that\nmachine, and it's a very secure way to go.\n\n97\n00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually I had got to\nimplement this at a previous employe.\n\n98\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.190\nA group of people were getting viruses\nleft and right, and we were doing\n\n99\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.480\neverything forbidding this things,\ntrying better antivirus, which did help.\n\n100\n00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.110\nPut it was still happening so\nwe thought, well,\n\n101\n00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.820\nyou know what,\nwe'll give you a virtual desktop.\n\n102\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.300\nAnd now,\neverything's done in the cloud anyway.\n\n103\n00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.700\nSo if your machine gets infected,\njust restart.\n\n104\n00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.790\nYou'll get a brand new instance\nof the virtual machine.\n\n105\n00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.970\nAnd you don't have to worry about it.\n\n106\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.130\nThat one's dead, it's gone,\nit's forever buried.\n\n107\n00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.950\nAnd you're back to business.\n\n108\n00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.960\n&gt;&gt; I like that system.\n\n109\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.290\nIt's very advantageous.\n\n110\n00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.170\nAnother term,\nwhen we talk about this, is honeypot.\n\n111\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.566\nAnd I like the term, and I like honey.\n\n112\n00:05:51.566 --> 00:05:52.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:05:52.898 --> 00:05:54.600\n&gt;&gt; It's a tasty sweet treat.\n\n114\n00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.490\n&gt;&gt; It is.\nIt's the world's perfect food, right?\n\n115\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.960\nA honeypot is a device that's\nset up to be intentionally\n\n116\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.260\nI don't wanna say vulnerable, but too-\n&gt;&gt; Enticing.\n\n117\n00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.290\n&gt;&gt; I hate to use that word,\ntoo, sometimes.\n\n118\n00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.840\nCuz when you start getting into\nthe legal aspect of it, you don't wanna-\n\n119\n00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.606\n&gt;&gt; Entrapment.\n\n120\n00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:16.574\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Entrapment, yeah, exactly.\n\n121\n00:06:16.574 --> 00:06:19.144\nWe wanna get away from\nthat thought process.\n\n122\n00:06:19.144 --> 00:06:23.280\nBut a honeypot is a system\nthat's set up and\n\n123\n00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.890\nit's made to look like any\nother machine on your network.\n\n124\n00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.060\nIt's made to look like it's\nholding important resources.\n\n125\n00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.820\nAnd the idea is that it\nattracts the attackers.\n\n126\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.750\nHoney attracts the flies.\n\n127\n00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.170\nYou set up a honeypot and hopefully you\nattract the attackers, the bad guys that\n\n128\n00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.010\nare getting into your network and\nthey're attacking your honeypot.\n\n129\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.000\nOkay, why?\n\n130\n00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.120\nWell, what's the point in that?\n\n131\n00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.512\nWhat does that get me?\n\n132\n00:06:45.512 --> 00:06:48.350\nWell, honeypots are typically set up for\na couple of reasons.\n\n133\n00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.830\nOne is just to do what I was just saying,\nis to detract or\n\n134\n00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.600\nto attract the attackers,\nto keep them busy.\n\n135\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.080\nAnd maybe,\nmy intrusion detection system will\n\n136\n00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.220\npick up those attacks that they're\nplacing or firing against my honeypot.\n\n137\n00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.340\nAnd I can stop them before they\never got to real data, all right.\n\n138\n00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.880\nThere's no real data on the honeypot.\n\n139\n00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.750\nThere has to be some data on there.\n\n140\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.440\nIt has to look like an asset\nthat a bad guy wants to attack.\n\n141\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.750\nSo if it's just a base install of\nserver 2000 with nothing on it,\n\n142\n00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.560\nany bad guy worth his weight in salt\nis not gonna mess with that machine.\n\n143\n00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.470\nCuz he knows it's a trap of some kind.\n\n144\n00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.900\nBut if it's running a relatively\nmodern operating system but\n\n145\n00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.760\nhappens to have a couple ports open.\n\n146\n00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.950\nMaybe a misconfiguration\nby an administrator, right.\n\n147\n00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.210\nAnd you look on there and sure enough,\nthere's some shares on there.\n\n148\n00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.110\nAnd they got really nice names, they look\nlike they might be something I wanna get,\n\n149\n00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.870\nthat's going to attract the attackers.\n\n150\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.340\nAnd hopefully I can detect that attack and\n\n151\n00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.000\nthen stop the attack before they\nmake it to my actual servers.\n\n152\n00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.116\nOther reasons people run honeypots\nare simply research, right?\n\n153\n00:07:49.116 --> 00:07:53.758\nYou see a lot of universities, law\nenforcement agencies, especially here in\n\n154\n00:07:53.758 --> 00:07:57.998\nthe States or some of our government\nagencies run these big honeypots.\n\n155\n00:07:57.998 --> 00:08:01.918\nAnd all they're doing is logging\neverything that's going on in those\n\n156\n00:08:01.918 --> 00:08:02.880\nmachines.\n\n157\n00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.410\nAnd what they're doing is\nthey're learning what the attack\n\n158\n00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.330\nvectors the bad guys are using,\nwhat methods they're using.\n\n159\n00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.260\nHow they're going about trying\nto perform these attacks and\n\n160\n00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.950\nthey're learning new vectors or\nnew methods that the bad guys are using.\n\n161\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.390\nBecause here, I mean what better way to\nlearn how the bad guy is getting into\n\n162\n00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.540\na system than to watch a bad\nguy get into a system, right?\n\n163\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like a poker player\nsitting at a table losing for an hour.\n\n164\n00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.354\nBut he's studying everybody at that table,\nhe or\n\n165\n00:08:28.354 --> 00:08:31.630\nshe is just going there's your tell,\nthere's your tell.\n\n166\n00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.810\nThen all of a sudden, now they can attack.\n\n167\n00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.730\n&gt;&gt; I like that analogy and\nI'm not playing poker with you.\n\n168\n00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, absolutely right.\n\n169\n00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:38.730\nThat's the idea.\n\n170\n00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.690\nSo there's research firms\nout there that do this.\n\n171\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.130\nThere's governmental\nagencies that run honeypots.\n\n172\n00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.380\nMany, some organizations\nchoose to run honeypots.\n\n173\n00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.176\nAnd a honeypot can be hardware, it can be\nphysical or virtual most of the time is\n\n174\n00:08:51.176 --> 00:08:54.467\nvirtual nowadays because\nit is just easier to setup.\n\n175\n00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:59.129\nIn fact you can do a whole net or you can\nvirtualize entire sub net of servers and\n\n176\n00:08:59.129 --> 00:09:04.090\nclients and really make it look good,\nhave fake activity going on in there.\n\n177\n00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.840\nAnd when it's all set and done if it's\nvirtual I can just blow it away and start\n\n178\n00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.970\nall over after I've gathered all that\nprogram information I wanted to gather.\n\n179\n00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.175\nMany places you can go out\nthere to find honeypots.\n\n180\n00:09:15.175 --> 00:09:16.805\nYou can make your own, right?\n\n181\n00:09:16.805 --> 00:09:20.275\nOr you can go out to some place like\nhoneynet.org, I think it's honeynet.org.\n\n182\n00:09:20.275 --> 00:09:25.021\nBut there's several out there\nthat have pre-built honeypots\n\n183\n00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:28.395\nthat you can just download and fire up.\n\n184\n00:09:28.395 --> 00:09:30.755\nWhen it comes to endpoint security,\n\n185\n00:09:30.755 --> 00:09:34.115\nanother area that we\nhave to pay attention to.\n\n186\n00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:39.390\nWe'd love to focus on our servers, we love\nto focus on our network devices, right,\n\n187\n00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.830\nour routers and our switches and our\nfirewalls and our intrusion detections and\n\n188\n00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:48.380\nour file servers and our web servers,\nour SQL Servers, all that stuff.\n\n189\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.040\nBut we can't forget about the endpoints,\nright.\n\n190\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.610\nWe always gotta think about\nthe weakest link, and\n\n191\n00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.760\nthat's where that human sits,\nand that is that endpoint system.\n\n192\n00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.100\nSo we've gotta make sure we're\nsecuring those because if we don't\n\n193\n00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.930\nsecure everything around them but\nleave those endpoints less protected,\n\n194\n00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.440\nthose become the weakest link, they\nbecome the attack vector of choice, and\n\n195\n00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.520\nthey end up bypassing\nall the other security.\n\n196\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.250\nIf I can get through the one endpoint and\nI can get on to your network\n\n197\n00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.890\nyour firewall's not doing you any good\nanymore because I'm already inside and\n\n198\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.720\nI'm just gonna bouncing\nfrom server to server.\n\n199\n00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that,\na lot of antivirus systems are now\n\n200\n00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.630\ncalling their clients endpoint protection,\nyou'll see that a lot anymore.\n\n201\n00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.955\nThey quit calling it just antivirus and\nyou'll see them as Semantic endpoint\n\n202\n00:10:31.955 --> 00:10:34.230\nprotection or\nKaspersky endpoint protection,\n\n203\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:39.070\nthings of that nature are becoming quite\npopular because that is a great vector for\n\n204\n00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.640\nme to have a jumping off platform.\n\n205\n00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.900\nI've already got some sort of in\nroad network into your machine,\n\n206\n00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.440\nand it's typically a lot less\nsecurity wrapped around it, so\n\n207\n00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.090\nwe need to take that in to account.\n\n208\n00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.350\nAnd don't forget the little guy out there\non the field that is most likely going\n\n209\n00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.700\nto be a vector of attack.\n\n210\n00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.940\n&gt;&gt; In a Windows environment\nwe have group policies,\n\n211\n00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.510\nanother way that I can\nmitigate many a risks.\n\n212\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:05.350\nGroup policy being a centralized\nconfiguration management\n\n213\n00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.150\nsystem in a Windows domain.\n\n214\n00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.180\nRather than run around to every single\nendpoint on my network, I can create these\n\n215\n00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.960\npolicies at the domain level, have them\napplied automatically and consistently.\n\n216\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.210\nEven if something gets changed,\ngroup policy can when it refreshes,\n\n217\n00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:25.480\nit can change those settings back,\nso in a Windows environment again,\n\n218\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.730\ngroup policy is a great way to\nhandle configuration management.\n\n219\n00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.910\nAnytime we can centralize something and\nnot have to run around from machine to\n\n220\n00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.350\nmachine to machine is gonna be a good\nthing, right, for several reasons.\n\n221\n00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.551\nOne, it's a lot of work running around\nfrom machine to machine to machine.\n\n222\n00:11:39.551 --> 00:11:42.751\nAnd nowadays, they're not all gonna\nbe in the same building as we are.\n\n223\n00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:46.400\nThey're gonna be across town,\nacross country in another country.\n\n224\n00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.590\nSo then somehow I'm gonna manage this.\n\n225\n00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.790\nTwo doing it manually you\nend up missing one or two.\n\n226\n00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.960\nThat laptop was out when I\nmade my pass through here or\n\n227\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.665\nthat door was closed as I walked by,\ndidn't know there was a computer there.\n\n228\n00:12:00.665 --> 00:12:03.817\nDifferent things then all of a sudden\nyou have got certain computers\n\n229\n00:12:03.817 --> 00:12:07.190\non your network that are in\nviolation of your security policy.\n\n230\n00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.375\nAnd so, anytime we can automate and\ncentralize that is a good thing.\n\n231\n00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I had to use group policy a\ncouple of times to do things like setting\n\n232\n00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:20.200\nSSL or TLS version inside of\na Windows Internet Explore browser, right.\n\n233\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.560\nThat's one version becomes exploitable\nvery quickly, a security bulletin goes\n\n234\n00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:30.230\nout, and now it's like we can't use\nTLS version 1.0 it's horribly exposed.\n\n235\n00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.570\nSo I've gotta go through now,\n\n236\n00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:36.750\nget a thousand end users to change from\nTLS one to two or whatever, right?\n\n237\n00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.180\nThat is a little difficult.\n\n238\n00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.370\nWith group policy that\nmakes that very easy.\n\n239\n00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.450\nI set the policy,\nit applies out to the entire company, and\n\n240\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.410\nthat change just gets made.\n\n241\n00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.430\nI only had to put it in one spot and\nthen hit apply.\n\n242\n00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.580\nVery much easier.\n\n243\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.520\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure you had the joy of\ntrying to walk your users through\n\n244\n00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.665\nconfiguring a proxy.\n\n245\n00:12:52.665 --> 00:12:53.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've\n\n246\n00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.145\nhad the joy of trying to walk my users\nthrough finding the start button.\n\n247\n00:12:57.145 --> 00:13:01.530\n[LAUGH] It can be a very daunting task\nto get someone who's not tech savvy\n\n248\n00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.570\nto do something that requires some\ntech savviness, even a modicum of it.\n\n249\n00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:11.070\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and I'm definitely not\nbashing end users or anything like that.\n\n250\n00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.550\nI mean there could be brilliant\npeople in whatever it is they do but\n\n251\n00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.840\nyou say proxy and they get this glazed\nlook, they have no idea what you mean.\n\n252\n00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.570\nAnd they don't care.\n\n253\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.030\nThat's what we get paid to do,\nis to fix that for them.\n\n254\n00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.220\nAnd so group policy lets\nus kind of centralize that.\n\n255\n00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.510\nAccess control lists.\n\n256\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.960\nEspecially something known as a sinkhole.\n\n257\n00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.710\nThis is a pretty cool concept.\n\n258\n00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:34.060\nA sinkhole,\nI've heard it called different things.\n\n259\n00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.370\nCompTIA calls it a sinkhole, so that's\nwhat we're going to stick with here.\n\n260\n00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:42.620\nIs a way that we can prevent\naccess to malicious sites.\n\n261\n00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.750\nAnd what we're doing is we're\ngonna use out DNS server, and\n\n262\n00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:50.040\nwe're gonna use a list of known,\nbad, malicious sites.\n\n263\n00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.650\nAnd we're gonna say, anytime one of my\ndevices tries to resolve a name that's\n\n264\n00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:58.868\non this list, give them this answer,\n127.0.0.1, right?\n\n265\n00:13:58.868 --> 00:14:00.358\nJust point them right back to themself.\n\n266\n00:14:00.358 --> 00:14:05.580\nIn other words, have them fail at\nresolving the name, all right?\n\n267\n00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.490\nAnd that's what we call a black hole or\na sinkhole because they're\n\n268\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.000\ntrying to connect and you can see them\njust going down the drain, they're not\n\n269\n00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.670\ngoing to be able to connect to it because\nthey can't get the IP address from DNS.\n\n270\n00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.080\nThis helps with all kinds of things.\n\n271\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.450\nAdware, spyware, things like that.\n\n272\n00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.700\nAnything that tries to connect back out,\nzombies even,\n\n273\n00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:32.000\nbecause think about this,\nlet's say we want to create a botnet.\n\n274\n00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.530\nWe're gonna take over machines all around.\n\n275\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.940\nFind some organization that has\nmachines that are left on at\n\n276\n00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.320\nnight that aren't doing anything.\n\n277\n00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.470\nNobody is going to notice.\n\n278\n00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.770\nThe CPU cycle is kicking up in the middle\nof the night, I'm going to infect them.\n\n279\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.680\nWell what does that bot have to do?\n\n280\n00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.880\nWell, it needs to get a command, right,\nit needs to reach back to command and\n\n281\n00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.400\ncontrol so that it can tell it to hey,\nit's time, all you bots go ahead and\n\n282\n00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.570\nlaunch your attack.\n\n283\n00:14:55.570 --> 00:15:00.580\nIf that bot cannot connect to that\ncommand and control It's not gonna work.\n\n284\n00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.250\nIt's not gonna do anything right?\n\n285\n00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:09.020\nSo we can effectively prevent these bots\nfrom being able to launch any attacks by\n\n286\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:14.190\nusing a sinkhole like this because we've\ngot these known sites, these IRC channels,\n\n287\n00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:18.820\nthings like that where we can prevent\nthose from being able to resolve.\n\n288\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.080\nNow, it's not foolproof.\n\n289\n00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.030\nA thing like sinkholes has great\nadvantages, does a lot of good.\n\n290\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.940\nThey're not foolproof.\n\n291\n00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.560\nIf my bot was hard coded,\nand this is a thing.\n\n292\n00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.540\nThe bad guys,\nthey work just as fast as we do.\n\n293\n00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.220\nSo what do they do to get around this?\n\n294\n00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.798\nThey hard code a DNS IP\naddress into their bot itself,\n\n295\n00:15:36.798 --> 00:15:39.506\nor into the malware itself\nthat's infecting that bot.\n\n296\n00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:44.342\nSo now does it need to use your internal\nDNS server to resolve the name of where it\n\n297\n00:15:44.342 --> 00:15:49.347\nneeds to connect to outside, to grab its\ncontrol, so you're not gonna stop it.\n\n298\n00:15:49.347 --> 00:15:54.165\nAnother one you can't Prevent\nexecution and propagation of malware.\n\n299\n00:15:54.165 --> 00:15:58.110\nAgain, it's really just stopping\nsuccessful DNS resolution.\n\n300\n00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:01.440\nBut that can go a long way in\nstopping certain types of malware.\n\n301\n00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nit's just that layer of defense, right?\n\n302\n00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.340\nWe're always building up the layers\nof defense, so that, yeah,\n\n303\n00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.250\nit doesn't stop everything,\nbut it stops some stuff.\n\n304\n00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:13.120\nAnd that leaves us with a much\nless of a job to try to\n\n305\n00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.120\nclean up when things do go awry, so a lot\nof things get pushed to the wayside and\n\n306\n00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.010\nnow I can focus in on the more difficult\ntasks, find some software or hardware or\n\n307\n00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.110\nwhatever to try to mitigate\nthose types of threats.\n\n308\n00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.080\nAll right Mike, what else is next?\n\n309\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.940\n&gt;&gt; Another term that\nwe've been hearing for\n\n310\n00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.750\na long time, A+, Net+,\nI think we've talked about all of that.\n\n311\n00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.630\nSecurity+ and now here as well,\nis hardening.\n\n312\n00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.500\nAnd that's just something we\nalways have to talk about.\n\n313\n00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.750\nWhen we talk about hardening a machine.\n\n314\n00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.510\nAnd it can be a server,\nit can be a client,\n\n315\n00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.990\nit can be a router, any type of device.\n\n316\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.860\nHardening just means we're going\nto get rid of the default values.\n\n317\n00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.320\nAll right, we're going to\nchange the default values and\n\n318\n00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.630\nwe're going to apply all known patches.\n\n319\n00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.780\nSecurity updates, firmware updates, and\n\n320\n00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:00.590\nwe're going to remove any unnecessary\nservices that don't need to be running.\n\n321\n00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.160\nThat's the idea behind hardening a system.\n\n322\n00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.535\nSo, goes to,\n\n323\n00:17:05.535 --> 00:17:08.015\nthere's no great surprise that we're\ngonna talk about that here as well.\n\n324\n00:17:08.015 --> 00:17:10.605\nBut again,\nwe've already got that basic concept, hey,\n\n325\n00:17:10.605 --> 00:17:14.595\nif I'm gonna harden a server,\nI'm going to apply all the latest updates.\n\n326\n00:17:14.595 --> 00:17:17.482\nI'm gonna make sure that it's up to\ndate with all of its security patches,\n\n327\n00:17:17.482 --> 00:17:21.922\nI'm gonna make sure that the only\nservices that are on it are necessary.\n\n328\n00:17:21.922 --> 00:17:25.192\nAll other ports and\nservices are closed and turned off.\n\n329\n00:17:25.192 --> 00:17:29.482\nI'm gonna make sure that,\nwhat was I gonna say.\n\n330\n00:17:30.562 --> 00:17:32.762\nYeah, so basic just general hardening.\n\n331\n00:17:32.762 --> 00:17:37.352\nMaking sure we're good, using good strong\nauthentication methods, all right.\n\n332\n00:17:37.352 --> 00:17:41.410\nNow going beyond that a little bit, let's\ntalk about, then again these are things\n\n333\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:45.200\nthat I think we walked about security+\nas well, but mandatory access control.\n\n334\n00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.870\nImportant concept we have to understand\nwhen we talk about mandatory access\n\n335\n00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:54.250\ncontrol, we're talking about using\na data classification system and\n\n336\n00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.770\nassigning labels, all right.\n\n337\n00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.260\nSo we have data that has labels and\n\n338\n00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:03.720\nwe have users that have labels and\n\n339\n00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:09.240\nin order to access the data your label\nhas to match the data label or be higher.\n\n340\n00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.340\nAgain you see this in the military\na lot is where you always see it.\n\n341\n00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:18.460\nTop secret, secret, confidential, whatever\nthe classification system you want to use\n\n342\n00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:24.170\nis, but it usually involves some\ntype of classification of the data.\n\n343\n00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.340\nOr I should say,\nit does have to be classified.\n\n344\n00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.470\nBecause once the data is classified,\nwe apply those labels, now I can say Mike,\n\n345\n00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.010\nyou have a general clearance, but\n\n346\n00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:36.030\nthis document you're trying\nto access is top secret.\n\n347\n00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.170\nYou don't have enough clearance, you're\nnot gonna be able to access that document.\n\n348\n00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.090\nAll right, so mandatory access control.\n\n349\n00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:46.700\nYou have to have the appropriate\nlabel to get access to that data.\n\n350\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.130\nWe've talked about\ncompensating controls before.\n\n351\n00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:54.930\nI said that there were, what's a good\nway to put this, a way to implement\n\n352\n00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:02.210\na control when trying to think,\na certain control is not available.\n\n353\n00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:08.500\nTemporary or in permanent type controls\nthat you might put into place.\n\n354\n00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:13.020\nOne of the examples,\nwhen I talk about compensating controls.\n\n355\n00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:20.760\nLet say that, what would be a good\nexample, separation of duties, right?\n\n356\n00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.770\nWe know that we should have\ndifferent people responsible for\n\n357\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.360\ndifferent portions of\nthe responsibilities,\n\n358\n00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.080\nmake sure one person can do it all\nas a good control to put it place.\n\n359\n00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.190\nBut we can't because\nthere's only two of us.\n\n360\n00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:37.680\nWe all have to do everything so\nI can't do a segregation of duty.\n\n361\n00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.368\nNow what would I do, I gonna put control\nin a place to make sure that one person\n\n362\n00:19:41.368 --> 00:19:46.180\nisn't, using those permissions to\ndo more than it should be doing.\n\n363\n00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.450\nWell, we could audit.\n\n364\n00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.470\nRight now we're gonna have to\naudit a little bit stronger.\n\n365\n00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.120\nWe're gonna make sure we pay attention\nto those log files a little more closely\n\n366\n00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.330\nbecause we know that we can't separate\nthe duties, so we're compensating,\n\n367\n00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.330\ndoes that make sense?\n\n368\n00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.550\nWe're putting in place\na compensation control.\n\n369\n00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.440\nWhat else?\n\n370\n00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.010\nBlocking unused ports and\nservices, we've talk about that.\n\n371\n00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.100\nI don't know what else to say.\n\n372\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.170\nHopefully yeah,\nif you're not using a service,\n\n373\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.090\nyou should turn it off,\nbecause it's just an attack vector.\n\n374\n00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.690\nIt's sitting there waiting for\nsomebody to come in.\n\n375\n00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.110\nWay back in the day, this is before back,\n\n376\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:27.900\nI guess this was Windows 2000,\nServer 2000, was it Server 2003?\n\n377\n00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.760\nNo, Server 2000.\n\n378\n00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:36.155\nWhen you installed IIS,\nyou also got FTP, SMTP.\n\n379\n00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.020\nYou got FTP and you got network new,\nor you got the network time protocol.\n\n380\n00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.660\nYou got several different services.\n\n381\n00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.590\nAll I did was go in and install IIS and if\nI didn't know better, I'd be running IIS,\n\n382\n00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.400\nand I'd have my web page up and running.\n\n383\n00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.330\nBut unbeknownst to me, my server was also\nlistening on several other ports, right,\n\n384\n00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.310\nthat I don't plan on using,\nI'm not securing,\n\n385\n00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.060\nI'm not changing the defaults for.\n\n386\n00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:03.290\nSo important part of hardening a machine\nis blocking unused ports and services.\n\n387\n00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:07.010\nWe've seen how we can use\nEnd Map to scan a machine and\n\n388\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.640\ndetermine what ports are open.\n\n389\n00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.690\nNot only that, we can use that information\nto fingerprint the operating system,\n\n390\n00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.140\nfingerprint the services that are running\non those ports, gain more and\n\n391\n00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.030\nmore information, which is just\nanother way into your machine, or\n\n392\n00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.480\nit's gonna aid the bad guys\nin getting into your systems.\n\n393\n00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:28.978\nPatching, I think we've\ncovered that pretty good.\n\n394\n00:21:28.978 --> 00:21:33.936\nNetwork access control is another method\nwe can use, controlling how, when,\n\n395\n00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:37.400\nwhy users are allowed to\nconnect to the network.\n\n396\n00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.970\nSeveral different ways we can go about\nthis, it can be time based right?\n\n397\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.910\nLet's say I'm a three shift shop,\nwell if I work the first shift\n\n398\n00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:51.000\nshould I be able to authenticate during\nthe third shift hours, probably not,\n\n399\n00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.060\nI don't need to be on the system I have no\nbusiness being there during third shift.\n\n400\n00:21:55.060 --> 00:22:01.510\nSo maybe we set it up to where my login is\nonly available during first shift hours.\n\n401\n00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.918\nRule based, role based,\nboth of these setting up rules.\n\n402\n00:22:05.918 --> 00:22:11.150\nRules typically we look\nat this on routers.\n\n403\n00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:15.470\nWhen we look at network access control,\nrouters are rule based.\n\n404\n00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.690\nWe set up rules one after the other.\n\n405\n00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.120\nAnd as a packet comes in,\n\n406\n00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.450\nit gets inspected and it goes through\nthose list of rules looking for a match.\n\n407\n00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:28.020\nAnd then he finds a match,\nit's gonna either drop or allow, or\n\n408\n00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.880\nallow secure,\nwhatever methods we have available.\n\n409\n00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.930\nBut it's gotta just run through\nthose rules until it finds a match.\n\n410\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:39.740\nThe key to remember with rule based is\ntypically the way these systems work\n\n411\n00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.540\nis the first rule that matches is\nthe rule that's going to apply.\n\n412\n00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.330\nAnd so we have to be very careful in\nhow we set up the rules, the order hat\n\n413\n00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:53.700\nthose rules appear in, can make all\nthe difference in the world, right?\n\n414\n00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.280\nIf you start off with allow everything,\nand then you say I only wanna allow this\n\n415\n00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.610\ntraffic if it's coming from\nthis IP address range.\n\n416\n00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:04.460\nAnd I don't wanna allow this traffic, and\nI only wanna allow this traffic if it's\n\n417\n00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.350\ncertain times of day, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n418\n00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:08.950\nThink about the rules, right?\n\n419\n00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.030\nIf the first rule says allow everything,\nyou're never even going\n\n420\n00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:15.100\nto make it to the other rules to be\nanalyzed to determine whether it should or\n\n421\n00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.270\nshould not allow that.\n\n422\n00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:21.410\nSo you can spend all day long\nwriting rules and setting it up, but\n\n423\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.840\nif your rules aren't in the right order,\nyou're not going to do any good.\n\n424\n00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.924\nSo careful with your rule based systems,\n\n425\n00:23:26.924 --> 00:23:29.554\nmake sure you understand\nthe way that system works.\n\n426\n00:23:29.554 --> 00:23:34.485\nI'm not saying all of them do that but\na good majority of rule-based systems do\n\n427\n00:23:34.485 --> 00:23:38.985\nprocess rules one at a time,\nfind a match, stop, no more processing.\n\n428\n00:23:38.985 --> 00:23:43.094\nNow you look at anything from firewalls,\nthat's typically the way they work,\n\n429\n00:23:43.094 --> 00:23:47.202\nyou look at I Was thinking of another\nexample, it's not really even security,\n\n430\n00:23:47.202 --> 00:23:50.360\nit really are remote access policies for\nexample.\n\n431\n00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.305\nIt's very important the way\nwe put those rules in.\n\n432\n00:23:52.305 --> 00:23:58.010\nRole-based is another way we\ncan do network access control,\n\n433\n00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:02.980\nwhere we create roles and\nwe assign access to the roles.\n\n434\n00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.010\nAnd then we put people, users,\nend users Into the roles.\n\n435\n00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.210\nIt makes management a lot easier.\n\n436\n00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:15.380\nIf somebody changes positions,\nI can move them from one role to another.\n\n437\n00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.692\nIf they no longer need\nthose access rights,\n\n438\n00:24:17.692 --> 00:24:19.819\nI pull them out of that particular role.\n\n439\n00:24:19.819 --> 00:24:26.420\nCuz nothing was directly assigned to the\nidentity, it was assigned to the roles.\n\n440\n00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.210\nAnd then the identities\nare added to roles.\n\n441\n00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:32.210\nWindows right, we use group-based\npermissions all the time.\n\n442\n00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:35.830\nThis is an example of role-based security.\n\n443\n00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:40.730\nAnd then location-based is another\nway we can do network access control.\n\n444\n00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:46.340\nWe want to control access based on\nwhere you're coming from, right?\n\n445\n00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.020\nIf you're inside the corporate network,\nwe'll give you access to these resources.\n\n446\n00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.050\nBut if you're VPNing from home,\n\n447\n00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.370\nyou're not gonna have access\nto those particular resources.\n\n448\n00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:55.340\nThey're too sensitive.\n\n449\n00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.160\nI can't have you downloading\nthem to your home computer,\n\n450\n00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.760\ntaking a chance that there's\na cached copy on your home network.\n\n451\n00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.991\nCuz I don't know what security is\ngoing on in your home network.\n\n452\n00:25:03.991 --> 00:25:08.637\nBecause that remote user, that sales user,\nI don't want you caching this information\n\n453\n00:25:08.637 --> 00:25:11.588\non your laptop and\nthen leaving my secure environment,\n\n454\n00:25:11.588 --> 00:25:15.605\nwhere you could lose the laptop,\nyou could connect to an insecure network,\n\n455\n00:25:15.605 --> 00:25:18.540\nbe compromised that way,\nI have no control over that.\n\n456\n00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.830\nI have control when\nit's inside my network.\n\n457\n00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:24.238\nSo I'm only gonna allow you access\nwhen you're inside my network.\n\n458\n00:25:24.238 --> 00:25:25.735\nRight.\n\n459\n00:25:25.735 --> 00:25:29.303\nOther location-based might be as simple\nas, looking at IP address ranges and\n\n460\n00:25:29.303 --> 00:25:33.260\nyou see private IP addresses coming\nfrom the outside of your router.\n\n461\n00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:33.891\nShouldn't happen.\n\n462\n00:25:33.891 --> 00:25:38.080\nWe know there's RFCs that should\nprevent that, or don't allow that.\n\n463\n00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.027\nAnd so\nsomebody's trying to spoof addresses,\n\n464\n00:25:41.027 --> 00:25:44.830\nlooking at where those particular\nranges are coming from.\n\n465\n00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.340\nSo a lot of different countermeasures\nthat we can implement\n\n466\n00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.300\nto help keep our networks, and\nour end users, and our endpoints secure.\n\n467\n00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.820\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nWell thank you so much, Mike,\n\n468\n00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.064\nfor walking us through the list,\n\n469\n00:25:55.064 --> 00:25:58.830\nthe laundry list as it were, of different\ncountermeasures that we can implement\n\n470\n00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:03.170\nto try to offset any negativity\ncoming from the Internet.\n\n471\n00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:08.010\nOr even some responses that also,\nhey we we see a threat is coming at us,\n\n472\n00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.508\nwe need to respond to that\nthreat in a certain way.\n\n473\n00:26:10.508 --> 00:26:13.080\nYou did throw a couple of those in there\nfor good measure and we appreciate that.\n\n474\n00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.150\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; That being said,\n\n475\n00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.900\nit looks like we've run out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n476\n00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:17.647\nJust in time too.\n\n477\n00:26:17.647 --> 00:26:19.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect timing on that.\n\n478\n00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.920\nSo we do appreciate your viewership.\n\n479\n00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.670\nMike we thank you for dropping by.\n\n480\n00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.400\nBut we're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n481\n00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.930\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n482\n00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:27.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n483\n00:26:27.760 -->

of\nITPRO.TV, I'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n6\n00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:22.880\nin today's episode we are back with\nmore on our CSA+ series for CompTIA.\n\n7\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.300\nAnd of course joining us in the studio,\nthe man, the myth,\n\n8\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.740\nthe legend,\nit would be like a day without sunshine if\n\n9\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.050\nhe didn't join us-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.040\n&gt;&gt; For this conversation, our good friend,\n\n11\n00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.870\nmister Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.275\nMike, welcome back, sir, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:33.843\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Uh-huh, doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:33.843 --> 00:00:34.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you for\n\n15\n00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.890\nthat incredible introduction,\nhopefully I can live up to that one.\n\n16\n00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.498\n&gt;&gt; Good luck.\n\n17\n00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:39.006\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:39.806\n&gt;&gt; Thanks very much,\n\n19\n00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.110\nno pressure here, right?\n\n20\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.670\nAll right, so yeah, continuing with our\ngood old CSA, for CompTIA, I'm gonna\n\n21\n00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.640\ntalk about some best practices when it\ncomes to securing a corporate environment.\n\n22\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.720\nThe first thing I wanna talk about\nis penetration testing, right?\n\n23\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.230\nAnd we've talked about that.\n\n24\n00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.420\nI know we've talked about it\nin other courses as well.\n\n25\n00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.380\nAnd when we're talking\nabout penetration testing,\n\n26\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.380\nit's something that organizations\nare seeing the value of more, and\n\n27\n00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.250\nmore nowadays,\nespecially in today's environment.\n\n28\n00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.060\nIt is important that we run through\nthese exercises to find vulnerabilities\n\n29\n00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.260\nbefore the bad guys do, and that's really\nwhat penetration testing is all about.\n\n30\n00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.430\nAnd I will say too, I wanna make sure\nwe understand the difference between\n\n31\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.800\nvulnerability testing, or vulnerability\nassessment, versus penetration testing.\n\n32\n00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.520\nRemember, a vulnerability assessment,\nor a vulnerability scan,\n\n33\n00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.329\nif I can say that a couple of times,\n\n34\n00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.600\nis really just running through a set of\ndefinitions of known vulnerabilities.\n\n35\n00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.060\nExamining in a system,\nwhatever that is, and looking to see\n\n36\n00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.780\nif any of those vulnerabilities exist\non that machine, and that's it.\n\n37\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.750\nThat's what a vulnerability test does, and\nthat's very important, we must do those.\n\n38\n00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.370\nBut it's really just a subset\nof a penetration test,\n\n39\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.170\nI know some people think vulnerability\nassessment, penetration test, same thing.\n\n40\n00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.990\nA penetration test goes much further than\na standard vulnerability assessment.\n\n41\n00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.470\nBecause with a penetration test you're\nbringing in the human elements.\n\n42\n00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.260\nYou're bringing in the creativity of\nthe human which can go way beyond\n\n43\n00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.680\njust exploiting a known vulnerability.\n\n44\n00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.360\nStart combining things, start\nthrowing social engineering in there.\n\n45\n00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.180\nStart throwing unknown techniques,\nor never before seen techniques,\n\n46\n00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.290\nand saying what would happen\nif we did it this way?\n\n47\n00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.200\nA vulnerability scan is not gonna do that.\n\n48\n00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.720\nYou either batch, or it doesn't,\nwhereas a penetration test\n\n49\n00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.070\ncan take all these other things into\nconsideration, and put them to work.\n\n50\n00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.260\nSo, big difference between vulnerability\ntest, versus penetration testing.\n\n51\n00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.780\nNow when it comes to a pen test,\nthings we gotta be familiar with there.\n\n52\n00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.460\nFirst off is rules of engagement, right?\n\n53\n00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.210\nWe have to make sure that any\npenetration test that's done,\n\n54\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.680\nwhether that's done by in-house or\nby a third party, has some type of\n\n55\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.140\nrules of what is going to be allowed and\nwhat is not gonna be allowed.\n\n56\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.490\nWhether it's a white box test,\na gray box test or\n\n57\n00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.080\na black box test, there still has to be\nsome type of rule set up ahead of time.\n\n58\n00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.630\nHey, if you find this,\ndon't go any further.\n\n59\n00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.170\nOr you're not allowed to\nhit this particular subnet.\n\n60\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.780\nThere just has to be some way\nbecause we're talking about our\n\n61\n00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.640\nproduction environment, typically and\nyes, I wanna find vulnerabilities.\n\n62\n00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.080\nYes, I wanna make sure that the bad\nguys can't take advantage of it.\n\n63\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.980\nBut whether it's bad guys that do\na denial of service on my web farm, or\n\n64\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.940\nit's my penetration testers that do\na denial of service on my web farm,\n\n65\n00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.200\neither way I've got downtime, right?\n\n66\n00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.640\nSo there has to be some sort of rules of\nwhat's allowed and what's not allowed,\n\n67\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.120\nand these are set ahead of time and\nthey're agreed upon.\n\n68\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.290\nI'm gonna jump through the list here real\nquick and jump down to authorization\n\n69\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.475\nbecause that really should probably\ncome first and go right along with this.\n\n70\n00:03:49.475 --> 00:03:54.830\nAnd we never do a penetration test\non anything that we don't own or\n\n71\n00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.250\nhave permissions to do.\n\n72\n00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.720\nAnd I don't mean permission from the guy\nin IT or the gal at the help desk.\n\n73\n00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.280\nWe're talking about\nthe owners of the network.\n\n74\n00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.400\nThe ones that actually have permission,\nor the authority to give you permission.\n\n75\n00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.180\nRight, your buddy can't call you and say\nlook, run a test on this web server and\n\n76\n00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.260\nsee if this is set up properly.\n\n77\n00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.180\nThat's not what we call permission,\nthis has to be typically in writing.\n\n78\n00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.100\nAnd it's to protect yourself as much as\nit is to protect the organization that's\n\n79\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.520\nhaving the ping test to perform\nbecause if you do bring them down and\n\n80\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.720\nyou cause a denial of servers and you\ncause an outage they could turn around and\n\n81\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.460\ntry to get some kinda\nrepercussion against you.\n\n82\n00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.450\nRight, if you're not covered\nwith your agreement there.\n\n83\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.840\nSo, making sure that you\nhave authorization, and\n\n84\n00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.360\nsometimes that can be tricky, especially\nnowadays in these dispersed networks or\n\n85\n00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.120\nhybrid networks where we're\nreaching out into the cloud.\n\n86\n00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.320\nRight, I might be able to perform certain\ntests on their internal network, but\n\n87\n00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.870\nI can't do those same tests\nagainst the cloud resources.\n\n88\n00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.880\nBecause again,\nthey don't own the servers that are,\n\n89\n00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.500\nthe physical servers that their\nvirtual servers are residing on.\n\n90\n00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.970\nSo they might give me permission, but\n\n91\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.310\nthey're not the ones that actually have\nthe authority to give me permission\n\n92\n00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.130\nwhen it comes to testing\nthose cloud services out.\n\n93\n00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Amazon's probably gonna give\nyou a very kind letter that says, stop.\n\n94\n00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.470\nJust stop right now.\n\n95\n00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.120\nDon't do that.\n\n96\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.940\nBecause, like Mike said,\nyou might have access to cloud stuff.\n\n97\n00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.440\nThey're giving you access to their\nsystems as a cloud provider, but\n\n98\n00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.150\nthey didn't say you have permission to do\npenetration testing against our hardware.\n\n99\n00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.170\nYou don't own that.\n\n100\n00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.120\nYou just rent time on that thing,\nso it does get a little\n\n101\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.690\nweird when it comes to trying to\nsecure your cloud environment.\n\n102\n00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.030\nAnd that's one of the reasons people\nwill tend to stay away from cloud.\n\n103\n00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\n\n104\n00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.130\nbecause it does become a little\nmore difficult to work with.\n\n105\n00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.140\nIt's definitely new for a lot of people.\n\n106\n00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.700\nIt's a change in the way we go about\ndoing things and the way we think.\n\n107\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.270\nSo people are delaying that move.\n\n108\n00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.140\nAnd you think, what harm could you do?\n\n109\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.150\nYou're only working with\ncompany XYZ's servers?\n\n110\n00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.020\nWho cares if they're residing on the AWS,\nor Microsoft's Cloud Service,\n\n111\n00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.350\nAzure, or something like that?\n\n112\n00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.810\nWell, the problem is, yes, if I'm doing\nan attack against their web server, and if\n\n113\n00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.125\nthey've got a vulnerable app, and I'm able\nto break into that web server and gain\n\n114\n00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:15.469\naccess to all that data that I shouldn't\nsee I'm already effecting that server.\n\n115\n00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.323\nBut what if I do something that causes\nthat server to start consuming all kinds\n\n116\n00:06:19.323 --> 00:06:20.680\nof resources right?\n\n117\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.820\nThat could end up bleeding\nover to other machines that\n\n118\n00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.110\nare being hosted on those same\nphysical machines and cause slow or\n\n119\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.340\ndown time even for other company servers\nso yeah definitely a bad thing to do.\n\n120\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.400\nSo something to keep in mind when it comes\nto authorization make sure you know who\n\n121\n00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.140\nyou have to get the authorization from in\norder to perform those penetration test.\n\n122\n00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.790\nTiming is another thing we have to worry\nabout, what, when can we do this test,\n\n123\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.940\nyou got peak business hours,\nmaybe they wanna us to do in off hours.\n\n124\n00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.110\nKeep in mind that some of these companies\nyou'll be working with are global so\n\n125\n00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.259\nwhat's off hours here is not off hours\nsomewhere else, so dealing with that.\n\n126\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.460\nScope, as I kind of mentioned when we\ntalked about the rules of engagement.\n\n127\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.600\nYou might have a scope laid out for\nyou that says you can go this far.\n\n128\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.525\nif you make it to our back end SQL server,\nstop there, right?\n\n129\n00:07:13.525 --> 00:07:15.625\nWe don't want that part tested, or\n\n130\n00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:18.945\nwe don't want this RND portion\nof our network tested.\n\n131\n00:07:18.945 --> 00:07:21.605\nWe know it's full of vulnerabilities,\nit's segregated out,\n\n132\n00:07:21.605 --> 00:07:23.095\nit doesn't have any internet access.\n\n133\n00:07:23.095 --> 00:07:24.965\nIt's protective on its own, so\n\n134\n00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:28.612\nwith the scope says, stay off of this\nparticular subnet, don't mess over there.\n\n135\n00:07:29.792 --> 00:07:33.455\nAnd then communication and\nreporting kinda go hand in hand as well,\n\n136\n00:07:33.455 --> 00:07:37.056\nobviously very important to\ncommunicate with the stakeholders,\n\n137\n00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:41.557\nthe ones that are hiring you, to whether\nthat's internal and they're telling you\n\n138\n00:07:41.557 --> 00:07:45.441\nhey this is what we need you to do,\nor you're bringing in a third party.\n\n139\n00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:49.297\nCommunication between the interested\nparties and that pen testing organization,\n\n140\n00:07:49.297 --> 00:07:52.294\nobviously very important keep\nthem abreast of what's going on.\n\n141\n00:07:52.294 --> 00:07:54.931\nA lot of that though will depend\non the rules of engagement,\n\n142\n00:07:54.931 --> 00:07:57.644\nit might be a Here's the information\nwe're gonna give you.\n\n143\n00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:58.928\nWe'll see you in two weeks.\n\n144\n00:07:58.928 --> 00:08:02.979\nAnd we don't expect any communications\nuntil the end of that period.\n\n145\n00:08:02.979 --> 00:08:06.080\nOr it could be that I need to communicate,\nhey, if we find something,\n\n146\n00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.146\nwe want you to let us know immediately so\nwe can begin working on that.\n\n147\n00:08:09.146 --> 00:08:11.880\nWe don't want you to wait until\nthe end of the penetration test.\n\n148\n00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.990\nSo, communication and then reporting.\n\n149\n00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.158\nMaking deliverables.\n\n150\n00:08:17.158 --> 00:08:19.400\nRemember who it is that\nyou're reporting to.\n\n151\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.696\nAnd this is one of the more\ndifficult spots, I think,\n\n152\n00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:23.390\nwhen it comes to penetration testing.\n\n153\n00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.921\nDaniel's over here nodding\nhis head in agreement,\n\n154\n00:08:25.921 --> 00:08:27.653\ncuz we've both been through this.\n\n155\n00:08:27.653 --> 00:08:30.725\nAnd you get excited\ndoing penetration tests.\n\n156\n00:08:30.725 --> 00:08:33.106\nAnd you wanna get in there and\njust start working.\n\n157\n00:08:33.106 --> 00:08:37.151\nAnd you just start going and\nyou lose track of just about everything,\n\n158\n00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:39.326\nat least if you get excited like I do.\n\n159\n00:08:39.326 --> 00:08:40.821\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I mean, you get so\n\n160\n00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:45.450\nfocused in there that you forget to\nstart writing things down and reporting.\n\n161\n00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.543\nAnd at the end, when you have to turn all\nof this in, that's when you go back and\n\n162\n00:08:49.543 --> 00:08:51.793\ngo, gosh, what did I do to get in there?\n\n163\n00:08:51.793 --> 00:08:52.526\nWhat did I?\n\n164\n00:08:52.526 --> 00:08:53.982\nThose kinda things, so.\n\n165\n00:08:53.982 --> 00:08:58.547\nAnd it's the part of the penetration\ntests that a lot of us find not\n\n166\n00:08:58.547 --> 00:09:00.550\nquite as exciting, maybe.\n\n167\n00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.677\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's definitely not as exciting\nbecause you're basically writing a book\n\n168\n00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:05.882\nreport on what you did.\n\n169\n00:09:05.882 --> 00:09:09.608\nYou're like back in high school going,\nI gotta turn in three pages of such and\n\n170\n00:09:09.608 --> 00:09:11.370\nsuch on Huck Finn, or whatever.\n\n171\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.185\nIt can kinda feel like that a little bit.\n\n172\n00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:18.560\nBut there's also a temptation to\nkinda flex your mental muscle.\n\n173\n00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.572\nLook at all I can do.\n\n174\n00:09:19.572 --> 00:09:20.123\nI did this.\n\n175\n00:09:20.123 --> 00:09:20.893\nI threw this attack.\n\n176\n00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:21.920\nI threw that attack.\n\n177\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.006\nAnd those people, those higher-ups,\n\n178\n00:09:24.006 --> 00:09:27.946\nthose C-level individuals that you're\nreporting to, they don't care.\n\n179\n00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:28.888\nThey don't care how you did it.\n\n180\n00:09:28.888 --> 00:09:32.018\nThey just wanna know very simply,\nwere you able to compromise us?\n\n181\n00:09:32.018 --> 00:09:34.479\nAnd very simply, where was that, right?\n\n182\n00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:37.490\nBecause they don't understand\nthe technical jargon that you could\n\n183\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.780\neasily throw at them.\n\n184\n00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.465\nTheir eyes are gonna glaze over.\n\n185\n00:09:40.465 --> 00:09:42.810\nOkay, remember,\nthis goes back to our communication.\n\n186\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.659\nHow well can you communicate to\nthe people that are important?\n\n187\n00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:48.310\nYou're providing a service to them.\n\n188\n00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.560\nIf they don't see any value in what you\nreported because they don't understand it,\n\n189\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.040\nthey're not gonna rehire you again.\n\n190\n00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.180\nThey're not gonna use you again.\n\n191\n00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.475\nSo you wanna make sure to add that\nlevel of know your audience, right?\n\n192\n00:09:57.475 --> 00:09:59.380\nAnd communicate effectively\nto them as well.\n\n193\n00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.196\nSo it could be a real temptation to try to\nrun down that road of look how awesome I\n\n194\n00:10:03.196 --> 00:10:05.156\nam, and my hacker skills are amazing.\n\n195\n00:10:05.156 --> 00:10:07.724\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you're doing a more technical\n\n196\n00:10:07.724 --> 00:10:12.210\naudience, that they're more technically\ninclined, maybe you can do that.\n\n197\n00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.085\nBut typically it's going to be C-level\npeople that don't wanna hear that stuff.\n\n198\n00:10:15.085 --> 00:10:17.858\n&gt;&gt; And\nin your reports you might have a breakout.\n\n199\n00:10:17.858 --> 00:10:21.107\nYou might have technical\nstep-by-step stuff, but\n\n200\n00:10:21.107 --> 00:10:23.570\nthen part of your report is the summary.\n\n201\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.190\nThat's for the C-level people\nthat you need to report to.\n\n202\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.951\nBut when it comes time for\ntheir internal people to fix the problems,\n\n203\n00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:30.865\nmaybe they'll like that\nmore technical side.\n\n204\n00:10:30.865 --> 00:10:34.972\nA lot of the tools that we use and\neven choose, right?\n\n205\n00:10:34.972 --> 00:10:39.580\nIt might make a difference to me what tool\nI use based on its reporting capabilities.\n\n206\n00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.340\nThis is something I'm gonna to\nresearch when I'm choosing a product,\n\n207\n00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.390\nis how well does it do the reporting?\n\n208\n00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.353\nDo I have to manually record\neverything I'm doing?\n\n209\n00:10:48.353 --> 00:10:52.246\nOr can I run this scan and\nat the end have a deliverable?\n\n210\n00:10:52.246 --> 00:10:56.617\nHave, not just a textile put on\nthe screen, but a nice bar graph, or\n\n211\n00:10:56.617 --> 00:10:59.560\na pie chart and summary,\nand all this stuff.\n\n212\n00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.284\nMany of the tools that we see\nnowadays include those capabilities,\n\n213\n00:11:03.284 --> 00:11:05.516\nespecially the pay or commercial ones.\n\n214\n00:11:05.516 --> 00:11:07.000\nAnd I'm not saying that\nthe free ones don't.\n\n215\n00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.290\nThere's definitely some out there that do.\n\n216\n00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.390\nBut usually that's one of the things\nyou're paying for, is more fancy,\n\n217\n00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.397\npretty deliverables.\n\n218\n00:11:13.397 --> 00:11:14.820\nSo that might make a difference to you.\n\n219\n00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.514\nBut reporting is extremely important for\nseveral reasons.\n\n220\n00:11:17.514 --> 00:11:20.300\nAll the reasons Daniel went through.\n\n221\n00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.563\nWhat about if this is in-house,\nwe need to go back and fix those things.\n\n222\n00:11:24.563 --> 00:11:26.780\nI need to see what they found.\n\n223\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:31.048\nI wanna compare this pen test\nwith the one we did last quarter.\n\n224\n00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:34.474\nI need those reports so I can see,\nhey, have things changed, right?\n\n225\n00:11:34.474 --> 00:11:37.212\nSo, reporting, a very important part.\n\n226\n00:11:37.212 --> 00:11:38.190\nReverse engineering.\n\n227\n00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.170\nAnother concept we need\nto be familiar with.\n\n228\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.438\nPretty, I shouldn't say that.\n\n229\n00:11:43.438 --> 00:11:47.794\nWhen we talk about reverse engineering\nwe're talking about trying to take things\n\n230\n00:11:47.794 --> 00:11:52.148\napart basically, and start with a product\nand maybe work backwards and figure out\n\n231\n00:11:52.148 --> 00:11:56.710\nhow it works, what it's doing, how it's\ndoing it, how it's manipulating stuff.\n\n232\n00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.083\nImportant to do reverse\nengineering In isolation, right?\n\n233\n00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:03.060\nGet it off your production network.\n\n234\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:08.615\nHave what we call a sandbox environment,\nwhere we know we're not gonna do any harm.\n\n235\n00:12:08.615 --> 00:12:11.720\nAnd we have an area where we can\nactually get in there and play and\n\n236\n00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.298\nnot worry about bringing\nproduction servers down or\n\n237\n00:12:14.298 --> 00:12:17.070\naffecting the bandwidth on\nthe production network.\n\n238\n00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:21.271\nSo having that sandbox area.\n\n239\n00:12:21.271 --> 00:12:25.600\nApplications that you use might create,\ngenerate their own sandbox environment.\n\n240\n00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.928\nSome of these applications that I can use\nto work with software and try to debug\n\n241\n00:12:29.928 --> 00:12:34.470\nthem and see what's going on inside them\ncould very well make their own sandbox.\n\n242\n00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.450\nBut if not,\nwe need to make sure that we do hardware.\n\n243\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:43.251\nAnother term that we need to be familiar\nwith that you might not hear every day is\n\n244\n00:12:43.251 --> 00:12:44.499\na trusted foundry.\n\n245\n00:12:44.499 --> 00:12:50.953\nAnd a trusted foundry is a place that I\ncan get hardware from that is trusted.\n\n246\n00:12:50.953 --> 00:12:52.983\n[LAUGH] It's as easy as that, right?\n\n247\n00:12:52.983 --> 00:12:56.175\nNo, I was trying to think of the name and\nnow I can't remember the acronym for it.\n\n248\n00:12:56.175 --> 00:13:00.544\nBut,the US Government has a trusted\nfoundry where they can go and\n\n249\n00:13:00.544 --> 00:13:05.636\nthey can buy integrated chips and\nthey know that the source is good, right?\n\n250\n00:13:05.636 --> 00:13:12.191\nThey don't have to worry about people\nmanipulating the firmware on these chips.\n\n251\n00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:16.223\nAnd that they know that they've been\nsourced from a trusted vendor or\n\n252\n00:13:16.223 --> 00:13:20.951\nprovider because I can't build a trusted\ncomputing base if I don't have trusted\n\n253\n00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:22.780\ncomponents going into there.\n\n254\n00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.980\nSo just a term to be familiar with,\ntrusted foundry.\n\n255\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.736\nOEM documentation is another place I\ncan go when we talk about doing reverse\n\n256\n00:13:31.736 --> 00:13:32.467\nengineering.\n\n257\n00:13:32.467 --> 00:13:36.150\nTrying to get the documentation from\nthe original equipment manufacturer.\n\n258\n00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:41.250\nI can use that to either help me reverse\nengineer or understand what's going on.\n\n259\n00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.454\nSoftware, malware,\nfingerprint, and hashing.\n\n260\n00:13:45.454 --> 00:13:50.302\nI think we've taken a look at VirusTotal\nat some point in this series.\n\n261\n00:13:50.302 --> 00:13:51.860\nThere's different ways\nwe can go about that.\n\n262\n00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.741\nBut I like VirusTotal.\n\n263\n00:13:56.741 --> 00:14:00.608\nIt's one of my faves, cuz I can take any\nfile that I have, I can run it through\n\n264\n00:14:00.608 --> 00:14:04.237\na hashing algorithm, dump that hash\nvalue up there in VirusTotal, and\n\n265\n00:14:04.237 --> 00:14:07.624\nthey can tell me if it's popped,\nor if it's something benign, or\n\n266\n00:14:07.624 --> 00:14:10.920\nif it's something known as malicious,\nor if they don't know.\n\n267\n00:14:13.122 --> 00:14:18.115\nYou're basically hashing it and then\ncomparing it against a database of hashes\n\n268\n00:14:18.115 --> 00:14:20.655\nto see if it's a known piece of malware.\n\n269\n00:14:22.975 --> 00:14:24.361\nTraining exercises.\n\n270\n00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:26.415\nNow there's some interesting terms here.\n\n271\n00:14:26.415 --> 00:14:30.845\nThese are some terms you've probably heard\nrecently if you're in the security field.\n\n272\n00:14:30.845 --> 00:14:35.055\nRed Team Exercises,\nred team-blue team, things like that.\n\n273\n00:14:35.055 --> 00:14:38.240\nAnd just wanna make sure that we\nunderstand what those terms mean.\n\n274\n00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.765\nKinda goes along the lines of white hat,\nblack hat, and\n\n275\n00:14:41.765 --> 00:14:45.147\nwhite box, gray box,\nblack box, things like that.\n\n276\n00:14:45.147 --> 00:14:50.687\nBut red team-blue team is something that.\n\n277\n00:14:50.687 --> 00:14:53.177\nWhat's a good way to say this?\n\n278\n00:14:53.177 --> 00:14:55.550\nA red team is typically\nthe offensive side of things, right?\n\n279\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:15:00.022\nWhen you're doing penetration testing,\nthe red team is the one that comes in and\n\n280\n00:15:00.022 --> 00:15:04.323\ndoes the actual aggression, does\nthe attacks, does the penetration test.\n\n281\n00:15:04.323 --> 00:15:07.326\nThe blue team is the other side of things,\nthe defenders,\n\n282\n00:15:07.326 --> 00:15:10.130\nthe one that are trying to\nkeep their network safe.\n\n283\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.720\nSo you've got red team team exercises,\nor red team-blue team exercises.\n\n284\n00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.052\nWe're doing penetration tests,\nwhere our red team is coming in and\n\n285\n00:15:17.052 --> 00:15:20.695\nthey are going to attack our systems or\nperform these penetration tests.\n\n286\n00:15:20.695 --> 00:15:26.333\nYou've got the blue team on the inside\ntrying to keep the network safe.\n\n287\n00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:29.398\nThe red team might or might not have\nprior knowledge of the network.\n\n288\n00:15:29.398 --> 00:15:31.980\nThat goes back to the rules of engagement.\n\n289\n00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.748\nWhat we've decided to give them,\nwhat information.\n\n290\n00:15:34.748 --> 00:15:38.614\nIt could be a white box test\nwhere they know everything.\n\n291\n00:15:38.614 --> 00:15:41.090\nIt could be a black box test\nwhere they know nothing.\n\n292\n00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:42.242\nAnd a lot of times we'll do both.\n\n293\n00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:43.638\nYou might think well, why?\n\n294\n00:15:43.638 --> 00:15:48.982\nWhite box testings are great because\nthey give me Full knowledge.\n\n295\n00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:52.957\nIf I give the red team everything\nthey need to know about my network,\n\n296\n00:15:52.957 --> 00:15:57.850\nthey can test every single component\nof my network and have very thoroughly.\n\n297\n00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.030\nSo that's a great test of everything we've\ngot to see what vulnerabilities we have.\n\n298\n00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.680\nBut it doesn't show me\nwhat the bad guys see,\n\n299\n00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.020\nbecause the bad guys\ndon't know everything.\n\n300\n00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.450\nI didn't make a document and\n\n301\n00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.590\npass it out to all the bad guys out\nthere saying, hey this is what we got.\n\n302\n00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:17.290\nSo that's where a black box test,\nmore realistically gives you\n\n303\n00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.440\nan idea of what the bad guys\nare actually going to be seeing.\n\n304\n00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.050\nWhen they perform a test.\n\n305\n00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.150\nOr grey box testing just means\nwe're somewhere in the middle.\n\n306\n00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.690\nWe've given them some information.\n\n307\n00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:29.980\nTypically, we do grey box.\n\n308\n00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.050\nWe don't want to do a full on black box.\n\n309\n00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.820\nBecause we're worried that, we've got part\nof our network that's very sensitive.\n\n310\n00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.550\nThey might find that, and\nit might cause problems in our network.\n\n311\n00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:42.080\nSo, we might do grey box for this is one\nsubnet we're going to have, we have.\n\n312\n00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.580\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nlet you know about it.\n\n313\n00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.270\nCuz we want you to stay away from it,\nor something like that.\n\n314\n00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.110\nAnd then, Comp TIA mentioned\nsomething called white team.\n\n315\n00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.620\nThey got red team,\nblue team, and white team.\n\n316\n00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.180\nAnd I will tell you that I've never\nheard of white team, and I've gone and\n\n317\n00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.890\ndone some research on this, and I'm still\nnot sure what they mean by white team.\n\n318\n00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:04.500\nSo, we'll do an addendum to this\nepisode once I discover that, but\n\n319\n00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:09.650\nI think What they are referring\nto is purple team.\n\n320\n00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.230\n[LAUGH] So, we are just throwing\nrandom colors out there.\n\n321\n00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.191\nLet's just give them a name [CROSSTALK].\n\n322\n00:17:16.191 --> 00:17:20.366\nBut we will say white teams slash purple\nteam because I am almost positive that is\n\n323\n00:17:20.366 --> 00:17:22.250\nwhat they are going for here.\n\n324\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.790\nBut purple is the one that we typically\nsee in the security industry.\n\n325\n00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.520\nIf you think about what color do you\nget when you mix red and blue, Daniel?\n\n326\n00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.450\n&gt;&gt; You get purple.\n\n327\n00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.790\n&gt;&gt; You get purple.\n\n328\n00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.720\nSo that kind of tells you what purple\nteam might be all about, right?\n\n329\n00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.670\nPurple team, one of the problems\nwith red team, blue team testing\n\n330\n00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.390\nis the red team is trying desperately\nto break into your network.\n\n331\n00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.290\nThey're doing this\naggressive penetration test.\n\n332\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.970\nThey're not sharing any information\nwith the blue team, however.\n\n333\n00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.650\nThe blue team is trying to\nprotect the network, but\n\n334\n00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.140\nthey're not sharing any\ninformation with the red team.\n\n335\n00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.470\nSo, in the end, we find out a lot\nof valuable information, but\n\n336\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.240\nour teams might not learn as much as\nthey could, especially the blue team,\n\n337\n00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.950\nthe ones that are doing the protection.\n\n338\n00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.620\nThey should learn from the attacks\nthat the red team was using.\n\n339\n00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.160\nAnd that's where the purple team comes in.\n\n340\n00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.560\nThe purple team kinda crosses\nthe boundaries between the red team and\n\n341\n00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.200\nthe blue team.\n\n342\n00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.850\nThis might be done, purple team\nmight be added as a separate test.\n\n343\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.720\nAfter a red team, blue team type exercise.\n\n344\n00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.330\nBut the idea is the purple\nteam can be saying, look,\n\n345\n00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.600\nhere's the avenue of attack\nthat the red team is using.\n\n346\n00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.130\nAnd they're having a lot of success.\n\n347\n00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.190\nLet's see what we can do as a blue\nteam to slow down that success.\n\n348\n00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.920\nWhat can we do to prevent that\nfrom being so successful?\n\n349\n00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.730\nHere's the techniques they're using,\nlet's see if we can prevent that.\n\n350\n00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.840\nSo, it's that crossover between\nthe red team and the blue team.\n\n351\n00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:42.420\nAll right, and the last thing we wanna\ntalk about here is just risk evaluation.\n\n352\n00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:49.430\nAnother subject that we've received in\nseveral classes but risk evaluation.\n\n353\n00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.790\nRisk assessment.\n\n354\n00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.140\nHowever, they want to term it.\n\n355\n00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.800\nWhere we're looking at the risks that our\nnetwork is facing and we're trying to\n\n356\n00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:04.640\nassess what the impact of that risk might\nbe and how I can go about mitigating\n\n357\n00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.500\nthat risk or lessening the likelihood\nof that risk impacting our environment.\n\n358\n00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.930\nSo, we usually have a matrix,\na threat matrix that will create,\n\n359\n00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.420\nwhere we talk about, those are the two\nthings we put in our matrix.\n\n360\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.970\nWe talk about the risk, or\n\n361\n00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:23.060\nI should say the likelihood of occurence,\nand then the impact upon occurrence.\n\n362\n00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.290\nAnd we'll make a matrix out of those.\n\n363\n00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.600\nWe might have some things that fall in\nthere that are very likely to occur, but\n\n364\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.830\nthe impact is minimal.\n\n365\n00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.280\nPort scanning, for example,\nwould be one that might fall under that.\n\n366\n00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.210\nYou're gonna get scanned.\n\n367\n00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.010\nAnything that faces the Internet\nis going to get scanned.\n\n368\n00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.330\nIt is a risk.\n\n369\n00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:43.170\nBecause it is typically the first steps,\nit's the footprinting phase, or\n\n370\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:46.420\nthe scanning phase I should\nsay of an attack, right.\n\n371\n00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.564\nSo, it is a risk we need to consider, but\n\n372\n00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:54.930\ntrying to make it, so\nthat people can't do port scans typically\n\n373\n00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.790\nmeans you're not able to provide the\nservices that you wanna provide, right.\n\n374\n00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.860\nSo, it's a risk that we have to accept and\nthe impact is low.\n\n375\n00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.450\nDoesn't really do me any harm, other\nthan maybe eat up some bandwidth on my\n\n376\n00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.930\npublic side and expose some information.\n\n377\n00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.620\nSo, I shouldn't say that it\ndoesn't do me any harm, but\n\n378\n00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.540\nit's something that I'm gonna live with.\n\n379\n00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.160\nWhereas, other types of risks where,\n\n380\n00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:21.120\nlet's say weak passwords on\nmy remote access solution.\n\n381\n00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.660\nWell, there if I have weak passwords\non my remote access solution,\n\n382\n00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.980\nthe risk is probably relatively high,\nbecause it's a matter of time before\n\n383\n00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.430\nsomebody finds that remote access server\nand runs a dictionary attack on it.\n\n384\n00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:36.220\nAnd if it's a weak password,\nthey're gonna crack it.\n\n385\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.270\nThe impact could be extremely high,\nbecause if they successfully get access to\n\n386\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.980\nmy network that's not going\nto be a good day, right?\n\n387\n00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:49.230\nSo that type of risk would be maybe\na higher, medium to high likelihood.\n\n388\n00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.420\nAnd a very high impact.\n\n389\n00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:57.450\nAnd the reason we do these is so that we\ncan work on them, work on our mitigation.\n\n390\n00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.588\nBut prioritize what we're doing.\n\n391\n00:20:59.588 --> 00:21:03.790\nI'm not gonna spend a lot of money and\ntime on a low impact, low likelihood risk.\n\n392\n00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.810\nBut I am going to spend some time and\nmoney on that high impact,\n\n393\n00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.200\nhigh likelihood.\n\n394\n00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.170\nThat's where we need to start.\n\n395\n00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:12.690\nThat's what we need to focus all my\nresources on, and work my way down.\n\n396\n00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.900\nIf there's anything left over, maybe\nI do go back and hit that low risk or\n\n397\n00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.800\nlow impact,\nlow rate of recurrence type risk.\n\n398\n00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.910\nBut definitely want to start\nwith those higher ones.\n\n399\n00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.480\nWe look at technical and\noperational controls any type of control.\n\n400\n00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.250\nTechnical, meaning something\nthat we've implemented\n\n401\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.600\noperational policy type controls.\n\n402\n00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.130\nTechnical may be authentication software,\ncameras,\n\n403\n00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:43.730\noperational, policies,\nprocedures that we've put into place.\n\n404\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.290\nThese controls have to be reviewed.\n\n405\n00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:47.100\nWe can't just put them in place and\nforget about them.\n\n406\n00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.460\nRight, they have to be tests,\n\n407\n00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.990\nwe have to make sure that they are doing\nwhat they intended for them to do.\n\n408\n00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:57.430\nAnd not just once, but regularly,\nsomething else that changes in the network\n\n409\n00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:01.160\nmight impact the performance of that\ncontrol, change its effectiveness.\n\n410\n00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.880\nI wouldn't know it if I'm not testing it,\n\n411\n00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.970\nI'm just assuming it's good,\nagain I'll go back to the silly example.\n\n412\n00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.630\nWe got those cameras, we put them in,\nI can see everything, that's great.\n\n413\n00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:15.340\nAnd then, unbeknownst to me, somebody\nrolled a rack right in front of that\n\n414\n00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.590\ncamera and now it's seeing nothing but\nthe back of the rack.\n\n415\n00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.060\nNow, for the last two months I've had no\n\n416\n00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.530\neye on the door to the server closet\nbecause somebody goofed something up.\n\n417\n00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.040\nAnd if I'm not testing it and going over\nthose, I'm not going to notice that,\n\n418\n00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.420\nI know that's a silly example, but\n\n419\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.480\nit kind of gives you the idea of\nwhy we need to test our controls.\n\n420\n00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.740\nAnd I think you already did hit a\ntechnical impact in likelihood again, when\n\n421\n00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:43.320\nwe do risk mitigation, or risk assessment\nI should say, we're trying to categorize,\n\n422\n00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:49.740\nand not just the impact, but\nthe likelihood of occurring.\n\n423\n00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.690\nAll right because both,\nwe could have something the risk,\n\n424\n00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.277\nwhat if it was a meteor.\n\n425\n00:22:55.277 --> 00:22:57.070\nDestroying our studios, right?\n\n426\n00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.290\n&gt;&gt; It could happen.\n\n427\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.670\nThat's a high impact, right?\n\n428\n00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:05.500\nBecause everything in the near\nvicinity would probably be destroyed.\n\n429\n00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.328\n&gt;&gt; We'd be out of business.\n\n430\n00:23:06.328 --> 00:23:08.390\n&gt;&gt; Depending on yeah,\nthe size of the asteroid,\n\n431\n00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.580\nit could be Gainesville is off the map,\nFlorida might have.\n\n432\n00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just the IT Pro TV.\n\n433\n00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.760\nA very specialized meteor\njust to take us out.\n\n434\n00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:21.600\n&gt;&gt; So, the impact, I don't know if you got\nmy pun there with impact, is high, right?\n\n435\n00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.870\nBut the likelihood of that\noccurring is very low and\n\n436\n00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.820\nagain I know silly example\ntake it to the extreme, but\n\n437\n00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:34.740\nI think it helps you visually, not\nvisually but it helps you mentally grasp\n\n438\n00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.400\nthe concept that there are some risks\nthat could have a very, very high impact.\n\n439\n00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.020\nBut the likelihood is so small that it's\nnot worth building a meteorite shield.\n\n440\n00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.070\nOr trying to go out and\nget meteorite insurance,\n\n441\n00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:51.160\nit's gonna cost me who know what?\n\n442\n00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.620\nI'd love to see what\na meteorite shield looks like.\n\n443\n00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.545\n[LAUGH] And\nhow much money that would cost.\n\n444\n00:23:55.545 --> 00:23:58.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's gonna be a little bit of R&amp;D in\n\n445\n00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.150\nthe process.\n\n446\n00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.700\nWe might not have it tomorrow.\n\n447\n00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.990\nBut I'm sure we can\ncome up with something.\n\n448\n00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.170\nLasers that will.\n\n449\n00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:04.812\n&gt;&gt; It's called the moon.\n\n450\n00:24:04.812 --> 00:24:05.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n451\n00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.220\n&gt;&gt; And Jupiter,\nif I have an understanding.\n\n452\n00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.575\n&gt;&gt; They've done a pretty good job so\nfar, haven't they?\n\n453\n00:24:10.575 --> 00:24:12.160\n[CROSSTALK] It's in the recent future,\nrecent history, yeah.\n\n454\n00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.927\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.\n\n455\n00:24:13.927 --> 00:24:17.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, but anyway, the\nconcept of, when we're doing our reviews\n\n456\n00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.200\nand we're doing our risk assessment,\nhigh-medium-low.\n\n457\n00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.540\nThat's just one standard,\nyou can use whatever you want.\n\n458\n00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.470\nYou can also do quantitative and\nqualitative type analysis.\n\n459\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.940\nBut we're not here dig\nit into risk analysis.\n\n460\n00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.410\nThat's a whole other class.\n\n461\n00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.000\n&gt;&gt; And it's not nearly as exciting.\n\n462\n00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.820\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But it has to be done,\n\n463\n00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.970\nso I take it back.\n\n464\n00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.260\nIt is fun, make sure you do it.\n\n465\n00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:36.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n466\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.370\n&gt;&gt; We are having fun today,\n\n467\n00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:39.250\nladies and gentleman.\n\n468\n00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:40.100\n&gt;&gt; Sure we are.\n\n469\n00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.380\n&gt;&gt; Mike, we've gone through a very of\ndifferent things that we need to know when\n\n470\n00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.590\nit comes to corporate and\nenvironment security.\n\n471\n00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.170\nDoing penetration testing, it's a lot of\nfun, if you guys have never tried it.\n\n472\n00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.920\nBuild a little home network and\njust start attacking the mess out of it.\n\n473\n00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.630\nAnd then, see what you can find out and\nthen try to create a report\n\n474\n00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:00.310\nbased off of that, that will help lend\nyou to understand the process and\n\n475\n00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.020\nwhy it's important and what it is\ngoing to look like in real life.\n\n476\n00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.220\nSo, that can be fun.\n\n477\n00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.030\nAlso reverse engineering was great stuff.\n\n478\n00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.140\nTraining and exercise.\n\n479\n00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.420\nThat is just part of the game ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n480\n00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.950\nMike thank you so much for reminding us\nand informing us these are the things we\n\n481\n00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:18.780\nneed to know specifically for\nthe CSA plus exam.\n\n482\n00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.090\nThat's hard there's a lot of vowels there.\n\n483\n00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:26.110\nBut in practicality these are practical\nthings that you probably will end up doing\n\n484\n00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:29.880\nas you get certified, become employed in\nthe business, start working in the field.\n\n485\n00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.430\nSo, we do thank you for that Mike but\nlooks like we've come to that time yet\n\n486\n00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:34.240\nagain, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n487\n00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.610\nThank you for joining us.\n\n488\n00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:36.860\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV.\n\n489\n00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.610\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n490\n00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:39.319\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n491\n00:25:39.319 --> 00:25:41.926\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n492\n00:25:41.926 --> 00:25:47.758\n[MUSIC]\n\n493\n00:25:47.758 --> 00:25:52.140\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:16.550\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.510\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.090\nwe are continuing through our series on\nCompTIA's Cybersecurity Analyst Plus.\n\n8\n00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.250\nAnd joining us back in\nthe studios is Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.216\nMike, how you doing today, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:25.216 --> 00:00:27.020\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, Wes,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.230\nExcited to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.873\nWe are continuing our journey, and\n\n13\n00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:32.848\nwe're gonna be looking at\nvulnerability management, right?\n\n14\n00:00:32.848 --> 00:00:37.835\nA very important part of IT security\nis dealing with vulnerabilities.\n\n15\n00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:41.303\nFinding those vulnerabilities,\nsearching your network,\n\n16\n00:00:41.303 --> 00:00:44.510\nlooking to see if you have\nany vulnerable systems.\n\n17\n00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.106\nAnd this is not a one-time thing.\n\n18\n00:00:46.106 --> 00:00:50.060\nThis is something that's an ongoing\ncyclical practice, right?\n\n19\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.970\nIt just over and over repeats.\n\n20\n00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.830\nAnd it is, like you said,\na very important part.\n\n21\n00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.425\nIt's something that more and more IT,\nI don't know what's a good term for it.\n\n22\n00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:03.343\nYou know, that IT workers,\nsecurity workers, are going to be doing.\n\n23\n00:01:03.343 --> 00:01:08.018\nWhich is a change something that\nwe years ago this was reserved for\n\n24\n00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:10.313\nmaybe penetration testing, or\n\n25\n00:01:10.313 --> 00:01:16.260\nonce in a while now it is becoming\na very regular practice of our security.\n\n26\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.560\n&gt;&gt; Mike, is that because you're\nstarting to see things like for\n\n27\n00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.860\ninstance inside of the IT security world,\nis that one administrator seems to\n\n28\n00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.850\ncommonly be wearing many\ndifferent hats today.\n\n29\n00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.266\nWe want an administrator but we also want\nan administrator to be the help desk,\n\n30\n00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.340\nwe want them to be tier one, two, three.\n\n31\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.100\nAnd the security's team as well.\n\n32\n00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.394\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I think it's\na combination of that,\n\n33\n00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:39.196\nwearing many hats especially into\nyour smaller shops, but also just\n\n34\n00:01:39.196 --> 00:01:43.809\nbeing more aware generally of how I can\nbe proactive rather than reactive, right.\n\n35\n00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:47.069\nI'm not gonna wait until somebody\nbreaks into my system to go,\n\n36\n00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.000\nI wonder what I could've\ndone to prevent that.\n\n37\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.150\nWe're gonna be proactive, because nowadays\neverything is on our systems, right?\n\n38\n00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.280\nYears ago, decades ago, the computer\nsystems held information for us and\n\n39\n00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.990\nwe used them to work.\n\n40\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.030\nBut now, everything is on there.\n\n41\n00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.370\nSo if we lose access, or\nif somebody breaks into our network,\n\n42\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.920\nthey can get everything\nthat we hold near and dear.\n\n43\n00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.010\nAll of the crown jewels for\nthe organization, all the information,\n\n44\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.850\nthe research, our customer information.\n\n45\n00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.570\nOr whatever the case,\nwhatever the business might be.\n\n46\n00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.630\nSo we have to protect that.\n\n47\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.130\nAnd because everything is so\nconnected, it's a lot easier for\n\n48\n00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.050\nthe bad guys to get their fingers at\nleast at the door of your network.\n\n49\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.500\nAnd so we've got to be proactive\nin looking for vulnerabilities.\n\n50\n00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.800\nFinding them, fixing them before\nthe bad actors or the threats out there\n\n51\n00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.020\nare able to realize those vulnerabilities\nand exploit them themselves.\n\n52\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.350\n&gt;&gt; You know, Mike, I've seen that there\nare a lot of different standards,\n\n53\n00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.980\na lot of different requirements out there,\nand I tell you what,\n\n54\n00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.360\nit could become a sea of\ncomplexity really, really quick.\n\n55\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.045\nSo when we took, when we need to take\na look on things like requirements.\n\n56\n00:02:49.045 --> 00:02:50.890\nIf you will, and those standards.\n\n57\n00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.576\nWhat kind of standards are we look at?\n\n58\n00:02:52.576 --> 00:02:56.691\n&gt;&gt; As you said there is dozens and dozens,\nI'm definitely not gonna list them all.\n\n59\n00:02:56.691 --> 00:03:00.130\nAnd we don't need to memorize\nevery one of them for this exam.\n\n60\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.360\nBut we do need to be familiar with,\nat least a few of the basic ones.\n\n61\n00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.808\nThe ones that we're gonna\nsee more often than not.\n\n62\n00:03:05.808 --> 00:03:07.221\nEspecially here in the U.S.\n\n63\n00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:10.894\nbut there's others out there that you'll\nhave to look up in your countries,\n\n64\n00:03:10.894 --> 00:03:15.060\nwherever you're maintaining your networks,\nor even if you're a multi-national.\n\n65\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.010\nYou might be based here, but\n\n66\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.790\nyou've got a data center that resides in\nanother country, understand that the laws\n\n67\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.340\ncould very well be different for dealing\nin storing your data and things like that.\n\n68\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.483\nSo we need to be familiar with\nthe fact that there are regulatory\n\n69\n00:03:27.483 --> 00:03:32.342\nenvironments out there and it is our job,\nwe have to do our due diligence.\n\n70\n00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:37.417\nNobody's gonna come up to us and say, hey\nMike, you're in the healthcare industry,\n\n71\n00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:41.520\nso you need to follow this regulation and\nthis regulation.\n\n72\n00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.010\nWe're not doing that.\n\n73\n00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.890\nWe as the IT have to be aware of that,\nand have to make sure.\n\n74\n00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.980\nAnd nowadays most organizations\nare fully aware of this.\n\n75\n00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.780\nSo it's not like we're surprising anybody.\n\n76\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.624\nI just wanted to make sure that we\nunderstand, you know it is our job.\n\n77\n00:03:54.624 --> 00:03:59.115\nWe have to do due diligence to make sure\nthat our organization is following all\n\n78\n00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:01.405\nthe regulations that need be.\n\n79\n00:04:01.405 --> 00:04:04.976\n&gt;&gt; So there is standards if you will\nout there, there is frameworks, and\n\n80\n00:04:04.976 --> 00:04:06.985\nthat's defines what the standard is.\n\n81\n00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:11.089\nBut it's up to us to make sure that we\ntake that infrastructure, that framework,\n\n82\n00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.310\nthose standards, and\nmake sure that we apply it to our systems.\n\n83\n00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.429\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\nAnd so, there's different ones for\n\n84\n00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:18.820\ndifferent industries,\ndepending on what you are.\n\n85\n00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.087\nAre you healthcare?\nAre you a financial institution?\n\n86\n00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:22.766\nAnd what kind of data do you do?\n\n87\n00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:25.110\nDo you take credit card payments,\nfor example?\n\n88\n00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.380\nThere's a set of regulations for that.\n\n89\n00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.490\nSo let's talk about a couple of them,\nbreaking down just a little bit.\n\n90\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.220\nLike I said you don't need to go out and\nget the white papers on these\n\n91\n00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.860\nregulations and memorize every act and\nparagraph in them.\n\n92\n00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.935\nBut you do need to be familiar with,\nI know is for this.\n\n93\n00:04:42.935 --> 00:04:45.069\nOr HIPAA is for that industry, right?\n\n94\n00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.930\nThose are the kind of things that\nwe probably need to be aware of.\n\n95\n00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.010\nSo let's start with HIPPA, right?\n\n96\n00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.810\nHIPPA is my healthcare,\ninsurance, portability and\n\n97\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.930\naccountability act, crazy right?\n\n98\n00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.788\nHealthcare, portability,\nhealthcare insurance portability and\n\n99\n00:05:00.788 --> 00:05:02.056\naccountability act.\n\n100\n00:05:02.056 --> 00:05:04.995\nAnd if you wanna pull up my computer here,\nwe can take a look.\n\n101\n00:05:04.995 --> 00:05:08.655\nThis is their website here, you can do\na quick search around the Internet,\n\n102\n00:05:08.655 --> 00:05:09.165\nand you can find.\n\n103\n00:05:09.165 --> 00:05:11.935\nJust make sure you go back to a place,\nlike if you're here in the US,\n\n104\n00:05:11.935 --> 00:05:13.695\ngo back to a site that's .gov.\n\n105\n00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:15.570\nGet some good information.\n\n106\n00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.672\nDon't get your information from, not that\nthere's anything wrong with some of those\n\n107\n00:05:19.672 --> 00:05:22.311\ndatabases of information I\ncan't say the actual name,\n\n108\n00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:24.234\nI don't know, but any of those pedias.\n\n109\n00:05:24.234 --> 00:05:26.870\nBut make sure you're getting\nit from a good source.\n\n110\n00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.940\nAnyway, HIPAA again, here in the states,\nthis is for healthcare information.\n\n111\n00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.244\nNow there's really two parts to HIPAA.\n\n112\n00:05:34.244 --> 00:05:37.750\nIt has two main acts, if you will.\n\n113\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.070\nThe first part of it is\nthe health insurance portability,\n\n114\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.440\nwhich really doesn't have anything\nto do with us, as far as IT goes.\n\n115\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.250\nThis is to make sure that when\nan employee leaves one organization and\n\n116\n00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.530\ngoes to another,\nthere's no gap in coverage.\n\n117\n00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.390\nAnd it deals with pre-existing\nconditions and things like that.\n\n118\n00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.400\nWe're really not worried about that.\n\n119\n00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.060\nIt's the second part that\nwe have to deal with and\n\n120\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.920\nthat's stating that any organization\nthat deals with healthcare information,\n\n121\n00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.120\npersonally identifiable\nhealthcare information.\n\n122\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.500\nThat has a certain level of\nprotection that has to be applied.\n\n123\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.464\nThat's what HIPPA, that's what the part of\nHIPPA that we're gonna be concerned with.\n\n124\n00:06:11.464 --> 00:06:14.270\nAnd this, for some, it's obvious.\n\n125\n00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.530\nIf you're a hospital,\n\n126\n00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.140\nyou're most likely dealing with personally\nidentifiable healthcare information.\n\n127\n00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.020\nYou need to follow HIPAA.\n\n128\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.988\nYou need to make sure that we\nare following those standards.\n\n129\n00:06:23.988 --> 00:06:27.530\nBut it's not just hospitals and\ndoctor's offices.\n\n130\n00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.650\nIt's anybody that deals with\nthat kind of information.\n\n131\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.660\nSo, billing services, right?\n\n132\n00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.710\nI have a friend that that's what they do.\n\n133\n00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.450\nThey're a company that goes to these\ndifferent hospitals and doctor's offices,\n\n134\n00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.700\nespecially the small ones.\n\n135\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.030\nThat don't have their own\nbilling department, and\n\n136\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.170\nthey do the billing for them.\n\n137\n00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.004\nThe collections and all of that stuff.\n\n138\n00:06:47.004 --> 00:06:52.020\nAnd I had to inform them, hey, you need to\nmake sure that you are HIPPA compliant.\n\n139\n00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.760\nWhy?\nI'm not a hospital.\n\n140\n00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.050\nBut you have personally identifiable\nhealth care information on your computer.\n\n141\n00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.460\nYour computer, even if it wasn't on their\ncomputer, because their computer can\n\n142\n00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.435\nconnect to these health care organizations\nthat do have that information.\n\n143\n00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:08.343\nYou're gonna need to make sure\nthat you're compliant with HIPPA.\n\n144\n00:07:08.343 --> 00:07:13.116\nSo again it's one of those\nthings understanding do I or\n\n145\n00:07:13.116 --> 00:07:15.725\ndo I not need to follow these?\n\n146\n00:07:15.725 --> 00:07:18.535\nAnd so being able to go out,\nlook this information up, again,\n\n147\n00:07:18.535 --> 00:07:19.960\nfrom a reliable source.\n\n148\n00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.520\nAnd trying to figure out if this\ndoes pertain to your particular\n\n149\n00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.790\norganization and\nthe data that you're storing.\n\n150\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.650\nSo that's HIPPA.\n\n151\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.467\nAnother one would be.\n\n152\n00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:35.030\nNow this is one that came around in,\nback in 2002.\n\n153\n00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.921\nOr it was when the act was created.\n\n154\n00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:40.547\nBasically I'm on one of our\ngovernment pages here in the US, and\n\n155\n00:07:40.547 --> 00:07:44.731\nit's got a few different, as you can see,\na few different regulations.\n\n156\n00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:49.225\nThe one I'm kinda curious about, or\nwanna point out is the Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\n157\n00:07:49.225 --> 00:07:54.086\nAnd this is, it applies to\nfinancial records and it says, hey,\n\n158\n00:07:54.086 --> 00:07:58.947\nyou've gotta keep your financial\nrecords for seven years, for\n\n159\n00:07:58.947 --> 00:08:01.753\nany of our financial institutions.\n\n160\n00:08:01.753 --> 00:08:03.779\nWhat was the case that brought this about?\n\n161\n00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:06.145\nDo you remember it was ENRON.\n\n162\n00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:06.955\nWhere's the what?\n\n163\n00:08:06.955 --> 00:08:09.354\nAll right, back in the Enron scandal,\n\n164\n00:08:09.354 --> 00:08:13.366\nwhen they're like,\nwe don't have those records anymore.\n\n165\n00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:16.247\nThat's when the government stepped in and\nsaid, look,\n\n166\n00:08:16.247 --> 00:08:20.389\nwe need to protect the stakeholders of\nthese organizations, and we're gonna say\n\n167\n00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:24.308\nyou are required to keep these financial\nrecords, for at least seven years.\n\n168\n00:08:24.308 --> 00:08:27.540\nWhether the person in charge\nleaves the company or not,\n\n169\n00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.440\nthose records need to be obtainable.\n\n170\n00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.910\nSo that's another an industry regulation,\nthat if you're in that industry,\n\n171\n00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:39.510\nif you're a trader or\nan investor, then you need\n\n172\n00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.970\nto make sure you're gonna have account\ninformation for all of your customers.\n\n173\n00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.208\nYou're gonna have personally\nidentifiable information for them.\n\n174\n00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:51.006\nThat information needs to be protected,\nand it needs to be retain for seven years.\n\n175\n00:08:51.006 --> 00:08:55.972\nThen there's a FISMA, the Federal\nInformation Security Management Act\n\n176\n00:08:55.972 --> 00:08:59.265\nof 2002 is actually been updated recently.\n\n177\n00:08:59.265 --> 00:09:02.662\nAnd is now the Federal Information\nSecurity Modernization Act,\n\n178\n00:09:02.662 --> 00:09:06.616\nluckily they changed, well they changed\nManagement to Modernization, so\n\n179\n00:09:06.616 --> 00:09:08.360\nit doesn't change the acronym.\n\n180\n00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.654\nYay, right?\n\n181\n00:09:09.654 --> 00:09:13.468\nIt's still FISMA,\njust change the name a little bit.\n\n182\n00:09:13.468 --> 00:09:18.965\nAll of our federal agencies do\nhave to apply or to follow this,\n\n183\n00:09:18.965 --> 00:09:25.660\nand this just deals with how do we\nstore sensitive information, right?\n\n184\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.750\nSo, any kind of federal\nagency here in the U.S.\n\n185\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.990\nhas to follow FISMA when they store data,\nthere are certain rules and\n\n186\n00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:38.950\nregulations and say hey, it has to be\nencrypted for example or has to be\n\n187\n00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.870\nprotected in someway so it only authorize\npeople who are allowed to access.\n\n188\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.940\nAnd then again, we're not going into\ndetails of what it actually specifies I\n\n189\n00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.780\ndon't think we need to that for this exam.\n\n190\n00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.530\nIf you want more information,\nthen definitely jump out to the web and\n\n191\n00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:54.290\nread up or if you are in a business\nthat you think this might pertain to,\n\n192\n00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.490\nthen go out there and\ndo some research, right?\n\n193\n00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:02.470\nFind out and see, ask some questions of\nyour co-workers but go out and do this.\n\n194\n00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.880\nWell, there’s another one,\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n\n195\n00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.630\nThis one was for financial institutions,\nand it just says, hey,\n\n196\n00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.640\nif you're a bank, if you're any\nkind of financial institution,\n\n197\n00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.830\nyou need to make sure that\nyou're not sharing information.\n\n198\n00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.870\nOnce again, we're gonna say, it's not that\nthey can't share customer information.\n\n199\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.221\nBut there's only certain parts of\ncustomer information they can share.\n\n200\n00:10:28.221 --> 00:10:33.717\nWe wanna safeguard sensitive information,\nprotect the customer's privacy.\n\n201\n00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:38.526\nSo this is any kinda financial\ninstitution, loan office,\n\n202\n00:10:38.526 --> 00:10:45.835\ninvestment advice, insurance all of them\nneed to follow the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,\n\n203\n00:10:45.835 --> 00:10:51.060\nthe FCC is the one that set this up here,\nin the U.S. all right?\n\n204\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.855\nAnd then PCI, this is another one\nthat I think a surprising number of\n\n205\n00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:58.252\nbusinesses most likely are already\naware of this but more and\n\n206\n00:10:58.252 --> 00:11:02.399\nmore businesses need this because we\nall take credit card payment right?\n\n207\n00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:06.227\nFrom, again a big glossary store, or\ndepartment stores all the way down\n\n208\n00:11:06.227 --> 00:11:09.260\nlittle mama and paps stores,\nor the food truck, right?\n\n209\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.890\nThat's taking their iPhone and\ntheir Square and swiping at a credit card.\n\n210\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:19.540\nAt that point, you are dealing\nwith credit card information and\n\n211\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.450\nyou need to make sure\nyou're following PCIDSS.\n\n212\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.910\nPCI security standards.\n\n213\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.810\nThese are actually\nan interesting one because these\n\n214\n00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.460\nare standards not regulations right.\n\n215\n00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.210\nSo when I say you should be following\nthese I want you to make sure we're\n\n216\n00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:33.770\nclear on this one.\n\n217\n00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:39.112\nThere is no regulatory body as of yet\nand there are no requirements for\n\n218\n00:11:39.112 --> 00:11:43.270\nsome of these PCI DSS,\nthey are security standards.\n\n219\n00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.475\nNow there might be a requirement\nby a credit card vendor that says,\n\n220\n00:11:46.475 --> 00:11:50.024\nhey if you're gonna use us, you need\nto make sure your PCI DSS compliant,\n\n221\n00:11:50.024 --> 00:11:52.944\nbut there's no the government's\nnot gonna step in and say,\n\n222\n00:11:52.944 --> 00:11:55.600\nyou have to do this to\ntake credit card payments.\n\n223\n00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.884\nUnlike those other one's like,\nHIPPA, Sarbanes Oxley, those are law,\n\n224\n00:11:59.884 --> 00:12:04.305\nyou have to follow those or you can pay\nserious fines, or even face jail time.\n\n225\n00:12:04.305 --> 00:12:09.252\nPCI DSS is again, still a standard,\nyou'll find that just everybody that\n\n226\n00:12:09.252 --> 00:12:14.043\ndeals with credit cards follow it,\nbecause it's a good thing to do it's\n\n227\n00:12:14.043 --> 00:12:18.911\nsmart it keeps you and your customers'\ninformation safe, but at the same\n\n228\n00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:24.043\ntime just make sure you understand it's\nactually not a regulation just yet.\n\n229\n00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:27.030\nBut yeah, anybody that deals\nwith credit card information.\n\n230\n00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.020\n&gt;&gt; Now what if Mike,\nif I'm constantly, and\n\n231\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.950\nthis is probably the bane of a lot\npeople out there that have any kind\n\n232\n00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.630\nof land line or even that, for\nthe most part today, cell phones.\n\n233\n00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.137\nI'm constantly constantly\ngetting this influx of calls,\n\n234\n00:12:38.137 --> 00:12:41.695\nmaybe at eight o'clock at night, because\nthey're in another time zone and it turns\n\n235\n00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:45.220\nout be telemarketers, and it turns out to\nbe somebody trying to sell me something.\n\n236\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.889\nIs there some kind of way, or\n\n237\n00:12:46.889 --> 00:12:51.404\neven technology that we can implement\nto maybe help stifle some of that?\n\n238\n00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:55.549\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely that's another,\nI don't know if it's really a regulatory,\n\n239\n00:12:55.549 --> 00:12:58.706\nI guess it is a regulatory\nenvironment because there is,\n\n240\n00:12:58.706 --> 00:13:02.486\nwhat we call here in the United States\nanyway, the Do Not Call List.\n\n241\n00:13:02.486 --> 00:13:05.830\nAnd you can get yourself out of, this is\na I don't know let's see if I can find\n\n242\n00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.830\nit before you pull my screen up\nthough let me do the search.\n\n243\n00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.151\nYou know, you never know what's gonna\nup when you search these things.\n\n244\n00:13:11.151 --> 00:13:16.061\nLet's see the Do Not Call List.\n\n245\n00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:20.368\nLet's see if I can find anything real\nquick, on a nationaldonotcallregistry.gov,\n\n246\n00:13:20.368 --> 00:13:21.017\nthere we go.\n\n247\n00:13:21.017 --> 00:13:24.094\nOkay, you can pull up my screen\nnow [LAUGH] We are safe, but here,\n\n248\n00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:27.165\nagain this is the FCC,\nthe Federal Trade Commission.\n\n249\n00:13:27.165 --> 00:13:31.801\nAnd they maintain this\nDo Not Call Registry, exactly what\n\n250\n00:13:31.801 --> 00:13:35.880\nWess was saying this is a place that\nyou can go and roll your number.\n\n251\n00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.132\nAnd then these organizations\nthat you use cold call lists,\n\n252\n00:13:39.132 --> 00:13:43.296\nyour number should not appear on their\nlist and they should not call you, and\n\n253\n00:13:43.296 --> 00:13:46.831\nyou say well how is that a regulation or\nan industry regulation?\n\n254\n00:13:46.831 --> 00:13:51.442\nNot for us, we don't do or do not have to\nput our number on that list it's up to\n\n255\n00:13:51.442 --> 00:13:55.767\nyou, but the companies that use cold\nCall Lists, their call numbers,\n\n256\n00:13:55.767 --> 00:14:00.266\nto sell product or advertise or\nwhatever, they have to follow that list.\n\n257\n00:14:00.266 --> 00:14:06.510\nIf they call people that are one that\nlist, they can face fines and jail time.\n\n258\n00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.360\nSo it's a regulation for the people\nthat are actually making the calls.\n\n259\n00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.835\nWe're saying hey,\n\n260\n00:14:11.835 --> 00:14:17.575\nhere is a database of numbers that do not\nwanna be called by you do not call them.\n\n261\n00:14:17.575 --> 00:14:22.539\nAnd again if they goof up they\nget reported they can get fined.\n\n262\n00:14:22.539 --> 00:14:26.396\nSo that helps us there, and again this is\nsomething that you might have to think\n\n263\n00:14:26.396 --> 00:14:28.448\nabout does your sales team do cold calls?\n\n264\n00:14:28.448 --> 00:14:32.554\nHave you ever thought about the fact that\nthey could be calling people that are on\n\n265\n00:14:32.554 --> 00:14:34.230\nthe Do Not Call List right?\n\n266\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.030\n&gt;&gt; The other things I think about Mike too\nis in one of the companies that I used to\n\n267\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.170\nwork for we used to have this\nconcentrator that would come in and\n\n268\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.630\nit would scrape a lot of the,\n\n269\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.360\nI can only imagine all of the information\nthat was coming into the network.\n\n270\n00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.920\nBut one of the things it did very good, is\ncontrolling things like the amount of spam\n\n271\n00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.090\nwe were seeing inside\nof our email servers.\n\n272\n00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:57.480\nAnd we know that spam out there it's\nthe bin of a lot of people's existence.\n\n273\n00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.108\nWe know that we have things\nlike DNS black list that people\n\n274\n00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.041\ncan get put on if they\nare a source of spam.\n\n275\n00:15:02.041 --> 00:15:05.030\nSo, we know that there are technologies\nand some techniques out there,\n\n276\n00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.166\nis there any kinda regulatory information\nthat we might need to be aware of,\n\n277\n00:15:08.166 --> 00:15:09.637\nwhen it comes to dealing with spam?\n\n278\n00:15:09.637 --> 00:15:12.965\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely,\nthere's the CAN-SPAM Act of 2002,\n\n279\n00:15:12.965 --> 00:15:16.750\n2003 of don't quote me on that one\nlet's look it up and make sure.\n\n280\n00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.009\nIn fact, here come to my website or\nmy computer here I've got the,\n\n281\n00:15:20.009 --> 00:15:22.352\nagain the Federal Trade Commission,\nthe FTC.\n\n282\n00:15:22.352 --> 00:15:26.472\nAnd the CAN-SPAM Act I don't see a date on\n\n283\n00:15:26.472 --> 00:15:29.554\nit-\n&gt;&gt; I believe it was 2003 signed into by\n\n284\n00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:30.440\nGeorge Bush.\n\n285\n00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.800\n&gt;&gt; Bush, there we go.\n\n286\n00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.670\nSo yeah 2003, and\nthis is dealing with spam, right.\n\n287\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:42.135\nWe here at ITProTV like to use emails as\nways to communicate with our members,\n\n288\n00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:47.182\nthis is something that we've got to\nthink about when we're sending out\n\n289\n00:15:47.182 --> 00:15:52.422\nemail in mass to many, many members\nare we gonna get flagged by somebody?\n\n290\n00:15:52.422 --> 00:15:57.331\nThe ISPs, the email providers, they might\nsay wow these people are sending out\n\n291\n00:15:57.331 --> 00:16:02.399\nbulk amounts of email every day, you can\nend up getting flagged or even reported.\n\n292\n00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:08.208\nCAN-SPAM penalties of up\nto 16,000 Dollars for\n\n293\n00:16:08.208 --> 00:16:11.750\neach separate email violation.\n\n294\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:14.580\nLet that sink in for a second.\n\n295\n00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.110\nI mean if you're sending out a group\nof 10,000 emails at a time every hour,\n\n296\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:24.360\nthat could add up really,\nreally fast if you violate CAN-SPAM.\n\n297\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.090\nSo, this is something that\nif your organization does\n\n298\n00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:31.520\nyou need to look into it and make sure,\nhow do I stay within the regulations so\n\n299\n00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.180\nthat I'm not considered a spammer?\n\n300\n00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.810\nCuz they take it very seriously,\nyou've seen it in the news recently\n\n301\n00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.800\nwhere they're bringing in known\nspammers and actually prosecuting them.\n\n302\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.280\nSo, it's something that you\ndo not wanna play with.\n\n303\n00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.749\nAnd CAN-SPAM as you can see, I'm gonna\nzoom in a little bit on my website here,\n\n304\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.520\ndon't use false or misleading header\ninformation, deceptive subject lines.\n\n305\n00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.580\nI mean, I know several that\nseem to violate this, right?\n\n306\n00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.860\nIdentify the message as an ad somehow,\ntell recipients where you're located.\n\n307\n00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.585\nThese are just different things\nthat you should follow, and\n\n308\n00:17:02.585 --> 00:17:04.725\nthat's not an all inclusive list.\n\n309\n00:17:04.725 --> 00:17:07.115\nThis is just a rundown of\ntheir main requirements.\n\n310\n00:17:07.115 --> 00:17:09.355\nAgain, this is from the FTC.\n\n311\n00:17:09.355 --> 00:17:14.745\nSo, if your organization does or\nplans to do email campaigns,\n\n312\n00:17:14.745 --> 00:17:18.225\nthis is something that you need to do your\nresearch on so when you go sit down at\n\n313\n00:17:18.225 --> 00:17:21.520\nthose meetings you can tell them, look,\nhere's something we've gotta keep in mind.\n\n314\n00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.520\nWe do not wanna pay 16 grand\nper email as a penalty.\n\n315\n00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.178\n&gt;&gt; And that's probably something they\nmight even have worked in there.\n\n316\n00:17:28.178 --> 00:17:32.113\nAnd I don't know, I'm just taking a guess\nhere, they would have some kinda SFP\n\n317\n00:17:32.113 --> 00:17:35.579\nrecord, sender framework policy,\nwhere it says this is the domain,\n\n318\n00:17:35.579 --> 00:17:38.713\nor this is the server that can\nsend email on behalf of my domain.\n\n319\n00:17:38.713 --> 00:17:39.910\nThings like that.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n320\n00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:43.140\nAnd I've noticed a lot of times,\nI use an iPhone currently.\n\n321\n00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.930\nAnd at the top of a lot of these emails\nit will say this is from an email list.\n\n322\n00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.810\nSo there are things in the header that\nare getting flagged and that that way\n\n323\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.895\nour systems know, and this is how our\nspam filters and other things work.\n\n324\n00:17:54.895 --> 00:17:59.179\nThey can read that information and\nthen flag it as spam or what have you.\n\n325\n00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:03.191\nAlso gives me a nice, on the iPhone,\nI know it gives me a a one-click,\n\n326\n00:18:03.191 --> 00:18:05.643\neasy way to opt out of\nthose mailing lists.\n\n327\n00:18:05.643 --> 00:18:10.660\nSo cool that it actually picks that up,\nso just another regulation.\n\n328\n00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.180\nLots of regulations that we need to\nfollow and these are regulations, again,\n\n329\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.170\nmost of these are here\nin the United States.\n\n330\n00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.850\nIf you're in a different country,\nyou need to make sure that you, again,\n\n331\n00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.090\nI know I keep saying this,\ndo your due diligence, do your research,\n\n332\n00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.880\nfind out what regulations might or might\nnot pertain to your particular industry.\n\n333\n00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.960\nAnd, what you need to\ndo to stay compliant,\n\n334\n00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.380\nbecause that's what we're supposed to do,\nright?\n\n335\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.200\nAs the IT people, we need to make sure\nthat our company is not getting in trouble\n\n336\n00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.500\nfor something that we're doing.\n\n337\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.040\nIt's gonna come back on us, all right.\n\n338\n00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.580\nNow, industry regulations,\ngovernmental regulations\n\n339\n00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.420\nI should say governmental regulations, not\nthe only ones that we have to deal with.\n\n340\n00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.410\nThere are industry regulations\nthat might in place\n\n341\n00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:57.100\nspecific to your industry like power or\nwater.\n\n342\n00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:01.462\nThere might be things In place\nthat deal directly with that.\n\n343\n00:19:01.462 --> 00:19:04.928\nAlso corporate level regulations, right.\n\n344\n00:19:04.928 --> 00:19:08.951\nYour company might put regulations in\nplace that it expects all of its branches,\n\n345\n00:19:08.951 --> 00:19:11.197\nall of its locations,\nall of its employees,\n\n346\n00:19:11.197 --> 00:19:14.350\nall of its computer networks to follow and\nmaintain.\n\n347\n00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.030\nSo again, understanding what those are and\n\n348\n00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.750\nthen figuring out how we can\nmaintain compliance with that.\n\n349\n00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.440\n&gt;&gt; MIke you've talked about these\nregulatory standards and all the different\n\n350\n00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.925\nspecifications that we have, but one of\nthe things that I know is that inside of\n\n351\n00:19:26.925 --> 00:19:30.755\na company they might have different types\nof information that they're storing.\n\n352\n00:19:30.755 --> 00:19:31.645\nI'll give you an example.\n\n353\n00:19:31.645 --> 00:19:32.895\nMaybe I go on a business trip.\n\n354\n00:19:32.895 --> 00:19:36.945\nI've got my business receipts for\nmy lunches that I paid for or something.\n\n355\n00:19:36.945 --> 00:19:40.075\nThat might not fall under things\nlike HIPAA compliance, but\n\n356\n00:19:40.075 --> 00:19:40.945\nhow would I know that?\n\n357\n00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:45.525\nHow would I know that maybe this\ndata falls under HIPAA or PCI versus\n\n358\n00:19:45.525 --> 00:19:48.600\nlike my receipts, which is just really\nfalling under give me my money back.\n\n359\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.660\n&gt;&gt; Hey, it comes down to data\nclassification is what you have to do.\n\n360\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.480\nYou have to make sure that your\norganization has a procedure in place,\n\n361\n00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.490\na workflow, that classifies data.\n\n362\n00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.020\nAnd so receipts,\nlike you were talking about,\n\n363\n00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.115\nI know I've worked with organizations\nthat provide financial assistance.\n\n364\n00:20:06.575 --> 00:20:09.325\nThat kind of information had\nto be maintained, I mean,\n\n365\n00:20:09.325 --> 00:20:11.815\nat this point we were dealing\nwith the big old bankers boxers,\n\n366\n00:20:11.815 --> 00:20:14.361\nyou know that was a little\nbefore the day of the computers.\n\n367\n00:20:14.361 --> 00:20:15.540\nBut same idea, right.\n\n368\n00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.460\nThat information went in bankers box and\nit was marked with a year and month.\n\n369\n00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.610\nAnd we knew exactly how long we\nhad to maintain that information.\n\n370\n00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:25.790\nShow notes for our shows, not the same.\n\n371\n00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.780\nI don't need to keep those for\nseven years,\n\n372\n00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.420\nI'm not worried about the IRS, the tax\nbranch here in the US, coming in and\n\n373\n00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.830\nauditing me and having to show show notes.\n\n374\n00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.060\nThey don't care about that.\n\n375\n00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.870\nSo classifying your data\nallows you to provide\n\n376\n00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:43.500\nthe proper level of protection\nto the data that requires it.\n\n377\n00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.230\nNot just doing it in mass or a blanket and\n\n378\n00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:50.380\nprotecting everything from\npersonal identifiable information\n\n379\n00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.320\ndown to the latest version of chrome that\nyou downloaded, or something like that.\n\n380\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.433\nThere are different types of data, and\n\n381\n00:20:57.433 --> 00:21:00.390\nwe can treat the different\ntypes of data accordingly.\n\n382\n00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.920\nAnd really the same thing we it\ncomes to your systems, right.\n\n383\n00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.394\nAsset inventory is a big part\nof vulnerability management.\n\n384\n00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:11.068\nWe have to know what we have.\n\n385\n00:21:11.068 --> 00:21:15.152\nIf I don't know what I've got, I don't\nmean, hey I know we've like 10 laptops and\n\n386\n00:21:15.152 --> 00:21:16.188\na couple of servers.\n\n387\n00:21:16.188 --> 00:21:20.851\nOr we’ve got a data center with 50\nlaptops and we have 2,000 desktops and\n\n388\n00:21:20.851 --> 00:21:24.135\n1,500 laptops,\nthat's not really good enough.\n\n389\n00:21:24.135 --> 00:21:28.261\nYou need to know what those systems\nare running, what they're providing,\n\n390\n00:21:28.261 --> 00:21:30.470\nif they’re providing services.\n\n391\n00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:31.920\nIs that a client level machine?\n\n392\n00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.980\nIs that a server that’s\nproviding services?\n\n393\n00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.740\nWhat types of access does it have?\n\n394\n00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.910\nWhat types of data is it storing?\n\n395\n00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:43.990\nBecause again, that's gonna help\nme apply the proper protection and\n\n396\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:49.040\nwhen we get into vulnerability scanning,\nknowing maybe how often I should go in and\n\n397\n00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.035\ntake a look at this machine and\nhow much I should care.\n\n398\n00:21:51.035 --> 00:21:56.830\nCuz my laptop here, we're not gonna run\na vulnerability scan on it very often,\n\n399\n00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.110\nbecause it's my everyday laptop.\n\n400\n00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.890\nIt might have some vulnerabilities,\nand I don't want it to,\n\n401\n00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.240\nbut it's also not storing a lot of data.\n\n402\n00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.410\nMost all of my data's up in\nour cloud driven storage.\n\n403\n00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:13.330\nSo really the risk of this laptop is it's\nvulnerable, somebody could attack it and\n\n404\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.720\nthen pivot from there to\nsomething else on my network.\n\n405\n00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.225\nSo it's not that it's unimportant but\nI wouldn't say look at it as often as my\n\n406\n00:22:20.225 --> 00:22:25.170\nservers that have my SQL Database with\nall my customer information in there.\n\n407\n00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.510\nAnd so that's why asset inventory,\nknowing what those systems are,\n\n408\n00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:33.330\ncan help us with our vulnerability\nmanagement if I can say that.\n\n409\n00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.610\n&gt;&gt; Mike, you know I wonder,\nI'm not exactly sure on this one,\n\n410\n00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:37.420\nmaybe you can help me out.\n\n411\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.950\nWould things like warranties and\n\n412\n00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.240\nSLAs to the devices that you have also\nbe considered a part of asset inventory?\n\n413\n00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.810\nAnd I'll give you an example where\nit directly affected security.\n\n414\n00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.810\nIn one company that I worked for,\nwe had an Equilogics box.\n\n415\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:54.020\nAnd we didn't really find this out\nuntil we were doing a service call,\n\n416\n00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.760\nI guess we should have known and\nhad we had asset inventory,\n\n417\n00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.800\nwe probably would've figured\nthis out a long time before.\n\n418\n00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.080\nBut since our service contract had run\nout, we couldn't do a firmware update.\n\n419\n00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.790\nAnd because we couldn't do a firmware\nupdate, now we've got systems that are now\n\n420\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.700\nfalling within the realm of\nvulnerable unpatched systems.\n\n421\n00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.370\nSo, could things like warranties and\nSLAs also be a part of asset inventory?\n\n422\n00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n423\n00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.650\nIt's very important that you track that\nkind of thing for that very reason.\n\n424\n00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.480\nThat was a perfect example.\n\n425\n00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.760\nIf you don't know when your systems\nare going out of warranty, or\n\n426\n00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.900\nif they're gonna be unsupported.\n\n427\n00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.820\nThe one we always think about is,\nsay operating systems.\n\n428\n00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.560\nWe know there's a lot of people out\nthere still running that XP machine,\n\n429\n00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.350\nbecause it's hosting some application\nthat won't run on anything else.\n\n430\n00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:39.390\nThat one XP machine is like a huge,\ngaping doorway into your network.\n\n431\n00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:43.100\nEverything else can be bulletproof,\nthat machine is vulnerable.\n\n432\n00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:47.270\nAnd it becomes the pivot point where I can\nthen attack other systems on the network.\n\n433\n00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.460\nSo understanding what you have,\nunderstanding what your SLA is with that.\n\n434\n00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:55.782\nWe're gonna talk a little bit more about\nSLA's, and then we'll use in a little bit\n\n435\n00:23:55.782 --> 00:23:58.823\nas well, we'll define exactly\nwhat those are coming up.\n\n436\n00:23:58.823 --> 00:24:03.022\nBut yeah, a very good point,\nunderstanding what you have and\n\n437\n00:24:03.022 --> 00:24:06.512\nwhether there is any service\nagreements on those.\n\n438\n00:24:06.512 --> 00:24:11.449\nAnd we talked about asset inventory and\nvulnerability management The other\n\n439\n00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:15.699\nthing we wanna consider,\nis it's not just my computer systems.\n\n440\n00:24:15.699 --> 00:24:17.494\nWhen talking about assets,\n\n441\n00:24:17.494 --> 00:24:21.613\nassets are not just computers\ninformation that we have, right?\n\n442\n00:24:21.613 --> 00:24:27.283\nProprietary knowledge, AC systems,\nphysical security devices,\n\n443\n00:24:27.283 --> 00:24:32.365\nall of that becomes part of our\nassets that we gotta maintain,\n\n444\n00:24:32.365 --> 00:24:34.238\nand you think, what?\n\n445\n00:24:34.238 --> 00:24:35.677\nAre you kidding me?\n\n446\n00:24:35.677 --> 00:24:40.011\nCameras, those IP-based cameras,\nare a great doorway in for\n\n447\n00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:44.345\nan attacker because,\nwhen's the last time you went around and\n\n448\n00:24:44.345 --> 00:24:50.830\nchecked the firmware on the 50 cameras you\nhave around the outside of your building?\n\n449\n00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:51.450\nRight?\n\n450\n00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.030\nHave you checked it?\n\n451\n00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.788\nProbably not.\nI know I haven't.\n\n452\n00:24:54.788 --> 00:24:59.027\nBut, yeah, I was just getting back from\nRSA and that was one of the examples they\n\n453\n00:24:59.027 --> 00:25:03.210\nwere using was how somebody took a,\nfound a vulnerability in a camera.\n\n454\n00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:07.100\nWas able to leverage that information\nbecause the camera was then compromised.\n\n455\n00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.842\nIt could figure out where it was sending\nthrough the config of the camera.\n\n456\n00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:12.105\nIt can figure out where it\nwas sending the data, right?\n\n457\n00:25:12.105 --> 00:25:14.165\nIt's not recording the data and\nholding it locally,\n\n458\n00:25:14.165 --> 00:25:15.715\nit's going back to their data center.\n\n459\n00:25:15.715 --> 00:25:19.630\nHow they know where it's going, and they\nfound a vulnerability in the NAS back in\n\n460\n00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.290\nthe data center,\nwhich let them compromise that system.\n\n461\n00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.640\nWhich let them get to, I think,\nthey got into cameras there as well.\n\n462\n00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.826\nI mean,\nit was this long string of things, but\n\n463\n00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:31.472\nthe point is it was the camera that was\ninitially the entry point to this attack\n\n464\n00:25:31.472 --> 00:25:34.915\nthat took someplace on a completely\ndifferent network somewhere else.\n\n465\n00:25:34.915 --> 00:25:38.723\nSo, understanding what you have,\nmaking sure you're keeping that update,\n\n466\n00:25:38.723 --> 00:25:39.830\nvery very important.\n\n467\n00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.684\nAll right, Wes, well, that is probably,\nlet's see what else we got.\n\n468\n00:25:44.684 --> 00:25:47.020\nI know we're getting short on time here.\n\n469\n00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.450\nI guess the last thing I wanna mention\nwill be critical versus non-critical, and\n\n470\n00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.730\nthis really ties back\ninto asset inventory and\n\n471\n00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.740\nunderstanding what we're\ntalking about there.\n\n472\n00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.740\nKnowing what systems are critical and what\nare not, cuz this is gonna tie in as we go\n\n473\n00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.375\nthrough a little bit of more\nvulnerability management.\n\n474\n00:26:02.375 --> 00:26:07.820\nWe talking about frequency, how often we\nshould be doing vulnerability assessments\n\n475\n00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:13.820\nand scans, prioritizing, we'll talk\na little bit more about that as well,\n\n476\n00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.950\nbut I can't do any of that if I don't\nknow what are my critical systems,\n\n477\n00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:22.200\nwhen it comes the time to do disaster\nrecovery if that ever happens.\n\n478\n00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.510\nUnderstanding which ones are critical,\n\n479\n00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:29.150\nknowing which ones I need to bring up\nfirst, it could prove very pertinent.\n\n480\n00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.912\nAnd it's not what you think, right?\n\n481\n00:26:30.912 --> 00:26:31.520\nThe oldm, well,\n\n482\n00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.470\nyou gotta bring up the mission critical\nservers first, actually not, right?\n\n483\n00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.740\nSo, we'll talk a little bit more about\nthat in an upcoming episode though.\n\n484\n00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.607\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say asset inventory\nmight show me that maybe my sand is\n\n485\n00:26:42.607 --> 00:26:46.163\na little bit more important than the Roku\nthat's out in the lobby streaming some\n\n486\n00:26:46.163 --> 00:26:47.669\nadvertisement banner, right?\n\n487\n00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:48.541\n&gt;&gt; Yep [LAUGH].\n\n488\n00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:50.673\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike,\nit does lot of great information, and\n\n489\n00:26:50.673 --> 00:26:52.324\nI know we got a lot\nmore great stuff to go.\n\n490\n00:26:52.324 --> 00:26:55.595\nBut judging by the clock it does look\nlike we're running a little bit short\n\n491\n00:26:55.595 --> 00:26:56.190\non minutes.\n\n492\n00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.466\nBut before we do, Mike, do you have any\nadditional information, maybe you'd like\n\n493\n00:26:59.466 --> 00:27:02.205\nto throw here in part one or\nmaybe we'll leave him with a cliffhanger?\n\n494\n00:27:02.205 --> 00:27:03.726\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I'll save it for\nthe rest.\n\n495\n00:27:03.726 --> 00:27:06.828\nLike I said, the only thing is\ndon't kill yourself going out and\n\n496\n00:27:06.828 --> 00:27:09.081\ntrying to memorize all\nof these regulations.\n\n497\n00:27:09.081 --> 00:27:12.672\nJust have a familiarity with the title and\nreally what they're designed,\n\n498\n00:27:12.672 --> 00:27:15.445\nwhat industry they're designed to protect.\n\n499\n00:27:15.445 --> 00:27:17.735\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, as always,\nit's a pleasure having you here.\n\n500\n00:27:17.735 --> 00:27:19.625\nAnd it's a pleasure having\nyou the viewer here.\n\n501\n00:27:19.625 --> 00:27:22.113\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n502\n00:27:22.113 --> 00:27:23.030\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n503\n00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.066\n&gt;&gt; And we'll

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:14.680\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.550\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n5\n00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.360\nAnd today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.530\nwe're continuing through our series\nin CompTia's Cybersecurity Analyst+,\n\n7\n00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.020\nif I can get that acronym right.\n\n8\n00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.950\nCSA+ and joining us back in the studios\nin none other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.070\nMike how you doing sir?\n\n10\n00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.077\n&gt;&gt; And that is why I say CSA+.\n\n11\n00:00:30.077 --> 00:00:32.620\n[LAUGH] I'm doing great,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.430\nWell it's excited to be here as always.\n\n13\n00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.580\nWe're continuing out conversation on\nvulnerability management, this is a part\n\n14\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.370\ntwo so make sure you go back and check\nout part one, if you haven't done so yet.\n\n15\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.160\nSo we're just gonna continue on,\nwe'll just jump right back into it.\n\n16\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.350\nThe next thing I really\nwant to talk about,\n\n17\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.960\nwhen we talk about vulnerability\nmanagement and vulnerability scanning\n\n18\n00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.470\nwhich is a big part of vulnerability\nmanagement is frequency, right?\n\n19\n00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.510\nThis is something that I get asked a lot.\n\n20\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.390\nHow often should we do this?\n\n21\n00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.330\nDo we need to do this once a month,\nonce a week, once a quarter, once an hour?\n\n22\n00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.840\nHow often do we do this?\n\n23\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.500\nAnd really, there is no right or wrong\nanswer to that question unfortunately.\n\n24\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.500\nI can't say that you should do it\nseven times a day at 7 o'clock,\n\n25\n00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.900\n8:15, 9:45, you know, something like that.\n\n26\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.530\nIt really depends on\nyour organization and,\n\n27\n00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.730\nhow you do your vulnerability scan,\nIt can depend on the tools you use,\n\n28\n00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.860\nthat can change the amount\nof time that it takes.\n\n29\n00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.330\nBut you definitely wanna do it more\nfrequently than less frequently.\n\n30\n00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.900\nIf that's a mushy,\nwishy washy kind of answer for you.\n\n31\n00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.910\nSo I guess really, there's a few\nthings that could help determine\n\n32\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.940\nyour frequency in your organization\nbecause that's what it comes down to is,\n\n33\n00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.790\nin my organization, how often do\nI really need to be performing\n\n34\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.370\nthese vulnerability assessments,\nvulnerability scans?\n\n35\n00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.080\nAnd the biggest thing\nthat'll drive this is your,\n\n36\n00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.720\nwhat we call a risk appetite, right?\n\n37\n00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.080\nAnd that just means,\nhow hungry are for risk?\n\n38\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.290\nCuz it's really good with a little\nbit of butter, pan fried in salt and\n\n39\n00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.880\npepper, I'm kidding.\n\n40\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.160\nYeah, that was a pretty lame joke,\nwasn't it?\n\n41\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was.\n\n42\n00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.000\nOkay, we'll move on.\n\n43\n00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.090\nI'm not a comedian, obviously.\n\n44\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.030\nSo risk appetite,\nhow does your organization handle risk?\n\n45\n00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.960\nHow does it deal with risk?\n\n46\n00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.730\nSome organizations, and even within\nan organization with some things you might\n\n47\n00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.200\nhave more of a risk appetite\nthan you do with others, right?\n\n48\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.050\nMy customer information, where I store\nall their credit card information,\n\n49\n00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.945\ntheir personal information,\nthings like that.\n\n50\n00:02:35.945 --> 00:02:38.165\nI have very little risk\nappetite when it comes to that.\n\n51\n00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:42.595\nIn other words, I will do what I can to\nprotect that information because I know\n\n52\n00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.535\nthat if there is an exploit or\n\n53\n00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:47.735\nif there's a vulnerability and\nsomebody does exploit that vulnerability\n\n54\n00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:51.635\nthat the repercussions from that could\nbe devastating to my organization.\n\n55\n00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:53.415\nI'm gonna lose customers.\n\n56\n00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:55.545\nI'm gonna lose customer's trust.\n\n57\n00:02:55.545 --> 00:02:58.175\nI'm gonna lose other organization's trust.\n\n58\n00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:01.640\nI'm gonna look bad in the public eye.\n\n59\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.030\nI'm gonna lose business.\n\n60\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.660\nI might not recover from that.\n\n61\n00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.610\nThat might put my business out, which\nmeans I have very little risk tolerance,\n\n62\n00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.715\nor risk appetite,\nwhen it comes to that information.\n\n63\n00:03:11.715 --> 00:03:13.795\nOther systems, though,\n\n64\n00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:19.065\nlike my access to the building,\nI've got a little more risk appetite.\n\n65\n00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:23.545\nI know that ideally I'd have\nbiometrics and a guard walking\n\n66\n00:03:23.545 --> 00:03:28.275\naround with a couple of dobermans or\nwhat have you protecting the place.\n\n67\n00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:33.195\nBut the risk of somebody breaking in and\nstealing stuff doesn't outweigh the cost\n\n68\n00:03:33.195 --> 00:03:36.900\nof implementing those systems, maintaining\nthose systems paying that guard,\n\n69\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.230\npaying those dogs, the liability for\nthe dog, all of that other stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.230\nIt doesn't add up.\n\n71\n00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.010\nSo in that case,\nI've got a little more risk appetite.\n\n72\n00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.040\nSo that's the kind of thing that\nyou're gonna be looking at.\n\n73\n00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.660\n&gt;&gt; Well, another scenario I was thinking.\n\n74\n00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.060\nI don't even know if this falls in line.\n\n75\n00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.635\nHelp me out Mike.\n\n76\n00:03:50.635 --> 00:03:54.050\nCuz maybe I've got mobile devices\ncuz we know with BYOD today,\n\n77\n00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.790\nmobile devices are very prevalent inside\nof our enterprise level networks.\n\n78\n00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.920\nAnd I asked a gentleman, one time,\nhe said he had a series of laptops.\n\n79\n00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.550\nAnd I'm like do you implement physical\nlocks, so people can't snag these?\n\n80\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.910\nHe's like well,\nwe got remote wipe capabilities,\n\n81\n00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.090\nwe've got full disk encryption,\nso we looked into that.\n\n82\n00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.730\nIt's like $500 per lock.\n\n83\n00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.350\nI mean, the laptop's $800,\nso we kinda looked at it and\n\n84\n00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.040\nwe said we're not really\ngetting much benefit out there.\n\n85\n00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.790\nWould that be something you'd\nbe classifying as well?\n\n86\n00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\nyou took a look at what the cost was.\n\n87\n00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.000\nYou're basically doing risk\nassessment at that point.\n\n88\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.270\nAnd you're looking at the impact\nversus the cost to mitigate that.\n\n89\n00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.650\nAnd you're balancing that, and\nyou're seeing if it's worth your while.\n\n90\n00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.910\nAnd when it comes to vulnerability\nscanning and frequency, yeah,\n\n91\n00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.590\nthat's the kinda thing we're looking at.\n\n92\n00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.580\nMy servers that have\na public-facing front end, right?\n\n93\n00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.440\nMy web servers,\nmy email server that sits out on the edge.\n\n94\n00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.325\nThose guys, I scan frequently because\nthey're facing a lot of risk.\n\n95\n00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:53.945\nAnd if they do get compromised,\nmy viewers,\n\n96\n00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:55.635\nyou guys out there won't\nbe able to watch it.\n\n97\n00:04:55.635 --> 00:05:00.755\nOr you'll get some derogatory stuff that\nsomebody's defaced my web page with.\n\n98\n00:05:00.755 --> 00:05:03.502\nThat would be really bad for\nour organization.\n\n99\n00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:06.772\nAnd so the frequency of scanning\nthat I do on those machines,\n\n100\n00:05:06.772 --> 00:05:10.582\nit's much greater than your\nlaptop that you use, right.\n\n101\n00:05:10.582 --> 00:05:14.152\nI don't do the scans on those very often,\nand then the same thing yeah,\n\n102\n00:05:14.152 --> 00:05:15.012\nwith mobile devices.\n\n103\n00:05:15.012 --> 00:05:21.210\nThese are the things, another one I\nthought about was USB thumb drives, right?\n\n104\n00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.430\nI know some organizations here in\nthe United States, the military for\n\n105\n00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.190\nexample, very few bases if any\nallow thumb drives anymore.\n\n106\n00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.600\nBecause of the ease of\nintroducing malware or\n\n107\n00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.350\nexfiltrating data with those thumb drives.\n\n108\n00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.390\nSo they just say you know what we're\ngonna allow them at all right.\n\n109\n00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.710\nBe another example of doing risk\ndetermining what your risk appetite is.\n\n110\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.720\nOther organizations they\ncould do the same thing.\n\n111\n00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.290\nThey could block all thumb drives.\n\n112\n00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.530\nThey could check you at\nthe gate when you come in.\n\n113\n00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.070\nBut they've decided that it's\nthe benefit doesn't outweigh the risk\n\n114\n00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.670\nbecause my users use thumb drives to\nmove data from one machine to the other,\n\n115\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.040\nor take data home to work with, and\nmaybe that's okay in your organization.\n\n116\n00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.910\nSo exactly, those are the kind of things\nthat we're going to be thinking about.\n\n117\n00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:13.230\nAnd what type of risk is your\norganization willing to face?\n\n118\n00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.430\nRegulatory requirements might\nalso be a guiding factor\n\n119\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.530\nin the frequency of\nvulnerability management, or\n\n120\n00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.150\nvulnerability scans and\ndoing vulnerability assessments, right?\n\n121\n00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.120\nYou might be in an industry that says,\nyou have to have an outside audit done so\n\n122\n00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.280\nmany times a year, like once a quarter or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n123\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.450\nSo it's not up to me now.\n\n124\n00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.720\nIf I wanna stay in compliance with these\nindustry or governmental regulations,\n\n125\n00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.310\nI need to perform these scans\nat a certain frequency.\n\n126\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.120\nSo it might not be my decision at all.\n\n127\n00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.460\nIt might be something that's\nthrust upon us, or forced upon us.\n\n128\n00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.130\nAs a regulatory requirement,\n\n129\n00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.750\ntechnical restraints can also\ninfluence your frequency, right?\n\n130\n00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.740\nIf you've got a large network and\na large system and\n\n131\n00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.770\nit's gonna take you a week to go\nthrough vulnerability scans on\n\n132\n00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.840\nall of your devices then you're\nnot gonna be doing it once a day.\n\n133\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.550\nIt would just be a little bit hard.\n\n134\n00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.950\nThere's only so many hours in a day and\nyou can't change that as of now.\n\n135\n00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.000\nThat might be a constraint,\nwhere I can't do it in a single day.\n\n136\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.400\nSo the frequency has to\nbe at least a week, or\n\n137\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.120\nI might have certain machines again,\n\n138\n00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.360\nyou don't have to follow the same schedule\nfor every single system on your network.\n\n139\n00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.680\nYou might have your critical systems\nare done once a day, but your less\n\n140\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.650\ncritical systems are done once a week or\nonce a month, so a lot of different things\n\n141\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.980\nthat can end up affecting or helping you\ndecide what that scanning frequency is.\n\n142\n00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.990\nWorkflow as well,\nwe wanna develop a workflow.\n\n143\n00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.578\nWhen we're talking about this, that\ninformation that we get from the scans\n\n144\n00:07:44.578 --> 00:07:48.234\ndoesn't do any good If nobody's\nactually looking at it, so\n\n145\n00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.975\nthere needs to be\na workflow involved there.\n\n146\n00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:56.194\nWho's responsible for going through that\ninformation, aggregating it, correlating\n\n147\n00:07:56.194 --> 00:08:00.588\nit with maybe other log systems if we\ngotta seam or For doing that manually.\n\n148\n00:08:00.588 --> 00:08:01.238\nWho's doing that?\n\n149\n00:08:01.238 --> 00:08:02.476\nHow long does that take?\n\n150\n00:08:02.476 --> 00:08:05.832\nBecause even if I could scan once\na day but if it takes two days to go\n\n151\n00:08:05.832 --> 00:08:09.938\nthrough the work flow with the information\nthat's generated from the scans,\n\n152\n00:08:09.938 --> 00:08:12.510\nthen the scan on Tuesday\ndoesn't do me any good.\n\n153\n00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:17.069\nBecause they're still trying to correlate\nand go through Monday's scan results so\n\n154\n00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:20.808\nall those factors tie together to\ndetermine what your frequency is.\n\n155\n00:08:20.808 --> 00:08:23.910\nAnd there's really no one answer for\neverybody.\n\n156\n00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:30.020\n&gt;&gt; Here's the scenario, Mike, that I think\nmight effect the frequency of scanning.\n\n157\n00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.589\nHow about if I've got\na large storage pole?\n\n158\n00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:35.160\nAnd I don't mean storage pole as\nany kind of specific technology.\n\n159\n00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.580\nBut I've got a collection\n\n160\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.630\nof my data that's getting up\nto the 64 terabyte range.\n\n161\n00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.470\nI mean, I know that I've scanned\na one terabyte home drive before.\n\n162\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.380\nAnd it's taken a day or\ntwo on an older system.\n\n163\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.840\nI mean, it's taken a long time.\n\n164\n00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.830\nSo if you've got terabytes and terabytes\nof information that you've got to scan,\n\n165\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.290\nand it could take three or\nfour days just to finish a scan,\n\n166\n00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.980\nwould that affect things like how often\nyou might scan that amount of data?\n\n167\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.650\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, those are all things that\nwe've got to consider when we're trying to\n\n168\n00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.410\nfigure out what is our frequency\nof doing our vulnerability scans?\n\n169\n00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:12.600\nOther things we need to think about,\nwhat's a good way to put this,\n\n170\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.485\nthe Tools that we're using, right?\n\n171\n00:09:15.485 --> 00:09:18.080\nAgain, I'll demonstrate\na couple of different\n\n172\n00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.730\nvulnerability scanners\nin upcoming episodes.\n\n173\n00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.289\nThere's dozens out there.\n\n174\n00:09:23.289 --> 00:09:26.689\nYou're gonna find the one that works best\nfor your company and the one that you can\n\n175\n00:09:26.689 --> 00:09:29.770\nafford to pay the licensing for and\nthat does what you need, right?\n\n176\n00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:34.390\nThere might be criteria that you need to\nconsider when you're choosing the software\n\n177\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.210\nthat you want to do your\nvulnerability scans with.\n\n178\n00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.193\nDoes it have reporting capabilities?\n\n179\n00:09:40.193 --> 00:09:42.920\nThat might or\nmight not be important to you.\n\n180\n00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.510\nDoes it have the ability\nto schedule scans, so\n\n181\n00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.960\nthat I don't have to remember\nto go run these scans manually?\n\n182\n00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.022\nThat or might or might not be\nimportant to your organization.\n\n183\n00:09:53.022 --> 00:09:54.800\nCan it scan remote machines?\n\n184\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.670\nDoes it scan only one operating system?\n\n185\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.720\nWhat operating system does it run on?\n\n186\n00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.440\nHow much resources does it take?\n\n187\n00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.760\nHow much bandwidth does it generate as\nit's scanning remote machines if it\n\n188\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.100\ndoes that?\n\n189\n00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.870\nDoes it support credentialed scans\nversus non-credentialed scans?\n\n190\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.860\nThese are the technical specifications\nthat you need to think about\n\n191\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.615\nwhen you're choosing\na vulnerability scanner.\n\n192\n00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.390\nCuz you can go out there and\nget a free one, that's great.\n\n193\n00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.860\nBottom line is, loving that,\nthe C officers are all gonna love that.\n\n194\n00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.330\nIt was pretty fantastic but\nit doesn't do reporting.\n\n195\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.030\nSo I have nothing turn in or I'm gonna be\nwriting on scratch pad and take in that in\n\n196\n00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.500\nthe board meeting and saying, here you\ngo this look professional, doesn't it?\n\n197\n00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.190\nAnd so if you're the only guy in the shop,\n\n198\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.450\nthen you don't need\nthe reporting capability, maybe.\n\n199\n00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.624\nBut in large organizations where I\nhave to go in and do board meetings or\n\n200\n00:10:42.624 --> 00:10:47.224\nhave staff meetings, or whatever, and\nI have to present that information,\n\n201\n00:10:47.224 --> 00:10:51.004\nreporting capabilities might be very,\nvery important to us.\n\n202\n00:10:51.004 --> 00:10:53.109\nWhat else?\nSensitivity levels, and\n\n203\n00:10:53.109 --> 00:10:57.846\nwe look at sensitivity levels, this\nreally ties back to what we were talking\n\n204\n00:10:57.846 --> 00:11:02.449\nabout earlier with critical and\nnon-critical information or systems.\n\n205\n00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:04.980\nIs that information sensitive?\n\n206\n00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:10.080\nWhen we do vulnerability scans, typically\nwe're not exposing the data itself.\n\n207\n00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.620\nWhat we're doing is we're exposing\npotential vulnerabilities in a system\n\n208\n00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.800\nthat could then lead to\nexposure of data potentially.\n\n209\n00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.640\nSo it's not these are gonna be\n\n210\n00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.330\naccessing sensitive information I\nguess would be a way to say it, but\n\n211\n00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:32.570\nsome certain systems that are locked down,\nthat do hold sensitive information.\n\n212\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.688\nCan the scanners scan them, right?\n\n213\n00:11:34.688 --> 00:11:38.059\nBecause we're gonna see in our demos\ncoming up that these scanners,\n\n214\n00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:42.590\nthey need administrative access typically\non the machine that they're scanning.\n\n215\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.880\nSo do I make the person that's running\nthe scan an administrator on that machine?\n\n216\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.600\nNow what else can they do besides\nrun a scan on their machine?\n\n217\n00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.080\nDo I have to supply the credentials in the\nsoftware itself before it does the scan?\n\n218\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.850\nIs it storing it?\n\n219\n00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:55.510\nHow is it storing it?\n\n220\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.530\nWhere is it storing it?\n\n221\n00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.940\nWho can access that?\n\n222\n00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.997\nThese are things you gotta think about\nwhen you're picking your vulnerability\n\n223\n00:12:01.997 --> 00:12:03.032\nscanner software.\n\n224\n00:12:03.032 --> 00:12:05.941\n&gt;&gt; Mike, one thing that it seems like\ncan get a little overwhelming is,\n\n225\n00:12:05.941 --> 00:12:07.660\nhow can I find out all this information?\n\n226\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.520\nI know when we're using certain platforms,\n\n227\n00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.600\nthey use things like Cloud-based\nheuristics, or just Cloud-based databases,\n\n228\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.810\nwhere they can find all\nthe vulnerabilities today, right?\n\n229\n00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.840\nAnd those big companies out there,\n\n230\n00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.050\nthey even are the first\non the zero-day exploits.\n\n231\n00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:28.330\nBut how somebody like me who's working on\nthe IT staff, that needs to keep up with\n\n232\n00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.460\nthe current trends and vulnerabilities,\nhow do we find that information out?\n\n233\n00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.410\n&gt;&gt; It can be challenging, that's for sure.\n\n234\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:39.283\nThat is a great point and if you're gonna\nget into security, which I'm assuming\n\n235\n00:12:39.283 --> 00:12:44.158\nmost of you here are, because that's\nwhy you're here, computers in general,\n\n236\n00:12:44.158 --> 00:12:48.336\nbut security especially is a fast-paced,\nchanging environment.\n\n237\n00:12:48.336 --> 00:12:50.878\nSo you have to like to learn and\n\n238\n00:12:50.878 --> 00:12:55.464\nto read if you wanna stay\ncurrent in a field like this.\n\n239\n00:12:55.464 --> 00:12:57.850\nThe question is how do you stay current?\n\n240\n00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.770\nBecause you've got your\nvulnerability scanner.\n\n241\n00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.900\nAnd those companies,\nmuch like anti-virus definitions,\n\n242\n00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.080\nare gonna be updating\nthat on a regular basis.\n\n243\n00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.582\nBut there are what we\ncall zero-day attacks.\n\n244\n00:13:08.582 --> 00:13:11.720\nThese are attacks that take place\nbefore anybody's had a chance.\n\n245\n00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.394\nSomebody has to be the first one,\nthe first victim, right?\n\n246\n00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:20.696\nAnd then typically, what happens is,\nsomebody gets victimized by some exploit.\n\n247\n00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:25.214\nThat system then gets bagged and\ntagged and sent off to one of these\n\n248\n00:13:25.214 --> 00:13:29.815\norganizations for disassembly,\nand they look at how they got in,\n\n249\n00:13:29.815 --> 00:13:35.017\nwhat vulnerability they took advantage of,\nwrite definitions for that.\n\n250\n00:13:35.017 --> 00:13:37.406\nSo their vulnerability\nscanners can now look and\n\n251\n00:13:37.406 --> 00:13:40.270\nsee if another system is\nvulnerable to that same exploit.\n\n252\n00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.490\nSo we do have to worry about\nthings like zero-day attacks and\n\n253\n00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.150\nbefore anybody knows about them.\n\n254\n00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.987\nBut then even ones that are known\nbefore they get updated.\n\n255\n00:13:50.987 --> 00:13:54.837\nBack to picking your vulnerability\nassessment software,\n\n256\n00:13:54.837 --> 00:13:57.845\nthat's one of the things\nyou should look for.\n\n257\n00:13:57.845 --> 00:14:00.300\nHow often do they update\ntheir information?\n\n258\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.587\nBecause if it's once a month,\nit's not worth it.\n\n259\n00:14:02.587 --> 00:14:08.330\nIt's not gonna help me protect my systems\nso you've gotta look for things like that.\n\n260\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.160\nBut to your point, Wes,\n\n261\n00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.730\nhow do we stay on top of that as\na IT professional in security?\n\n262\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.360\nThere's many different\nsites you can go to.\n\n263\n00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:23.315\nJust about every antivirus solution\nmaintains some type of site,\n\n264\n00:14:23.315 --> 00:14:25.559\nbug tracker type thing.\n\n265\n00:14:25.559 --> 00:14:32.174\nHere in the US, there's places like NIST,\nand gosh, now brain cramp,\n\n266\n00:14:32.174 --> 00:14:37.370\nNational Institution Security-\n&gt;&gt; It's National Institution for\n\n267\n00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:38.820\nStandards Technologies.\n\n268\n00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.455\n&gt;&gt; Standards and Technology,\nthank you, brain fart there.\n\n269\n00:14:42.455 --> 00:14:45.990\nYeah, there's places like this\nthat do maintain information.\n\n270\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.775\nAnd then those are just a few.\n\n271\n00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:51.645\nYou can go out there and find these\nplaces, and you join their lists,\n\n272\n00:14:51.645 --> 00:14:52.390\nbasically.\n\n273\n00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.319\nI'll show you here.\n\n274\n00:14:54.319 --> 00:14:56.090\nFeedly is the one I use.\n\n275\n00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.410\nThere are dozens and dozens of these, so\n\n276\n00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.530\nI'm not saying one is\nbetter than the other.\n\n277\n00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.670\nThis just happens to be the one I use.\n\n278\n00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:07.370\nBut Feedly is basically an RSS reader and\nI can go to these different places.\n\n279\n00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.800\nAnd I can connect to them and\nI can subscribe to their feed.\n\n280\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.750\nAnd then I can get this information\npiped right to my desktop.\n\n281\n00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:17.338\nI don't have to go through a list of okay,\nit's 8:45.\n\n282\n00:15:17.338 --> 00:15:18.698\nI got about 15 minutes and\n\n283\n00:15:18.698 --> 00:15:22.770\nI need to go through 15 different\nwebsites to see what's going on.\n\n284\n00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.129\nI've got my Feedly here and\nI can pull this information up.\n\n285\n00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:26.550\nAnd it's all right here.\n\n286\n00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.320\nIf we take a look,\nI think we've got my screen pulled up.\n\n287\n00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.410\nI'll zoom in a little bit so you can see\nthat I have a Vulnerabilities group.\n\n288\n00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:39.462\nPlaces like Bugtraqs [COUGH] excuse me,\nCERT, the National Vulnerability.\n\n289\n00:15:39.462 --> 00:15:41.990\nLet's see if I can get off of that for\na second.\n\n290\n00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.956\nI'll grab this guy here,\nThe National Vulnerability Database.\n\n291\n00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:47.524\nIn places like this, again, today,\n\n292\n00:15:47.524 --> 00:15:51.310\nlook at all of these that have\nbeen released just today.\n\n293\n00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:54.445\nI'm still scrolling.\n\n294\n00:15:54.445 --> 00:15:55.327\nFinally got back to yesterday.\n\n295\n00:15:55.327 --> 00:15:58.429\nSo where was I?\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\n\n296\n00:15:58.429 --> 00:15:59.089\n11-\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n297\n00:15:59.089 --> 00:16:05.168\n&gt;&gt; 12, 13, 14, 15, 15 different\nexploits that they're talking about.\n\n298\n00:16:05.168 --> 00:16:07.076\nIn just today.\n\n299\n00:16:07.076 --> 00:16:08.129\nAnd today's not over.\n\n300\n00:16:08.129 --> 00:16:12.510\n[LAUGH] Right, here in the US and\nFlorida, it's only two o'clock, 2:40.\n\n301\n00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.820\nSo lots of, I can click on one of these.\n\n302\n00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.274\nIt'll give me a little bit of information.\n\n303\n00:16:16.274 --> 00:16:19.720\nLooks like USG50 security appliance and\nNWA33, 35,\n\n304\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:25.450\n60 N access point allows remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service,\n\n305\n00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:31.190\nCPU consumption via a flood of ICPv4\nport unreachable packets, right.\n\n306\n00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.750\nSo if I'm running one of these,\n\n307\n00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.670\nthis might be something I want\nto read a little further on.\n\n308\n00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:40.140\nI might want to visit that website,\nsee if they've got an update before I\n\n309\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.130\nfind this in a vulnerability\nscan if we do once a week.\n\n310\n00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:47.310\nI know about it right now, and I can\ngo and I can get that latest patch, or\n\n311\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.080\nI can watch that website\nbecause I guarantee you,\n\n312\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.800\nthey're working vigilantly\nto create a patch for that.\n\n313\n00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.020\nBecause now that\nvulnerability is public and\n\n314\n00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.710\npeople are gonna start\ngetting compromised.\n\n315\n00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:59.980\nSo they're working on a patch.\n\n316\n00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.200\nThey might have been notified even before\nit went public, so they might already\n\n317\n00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.970\nhave one and in the works or out there\nthat I can go to that website and\n\n318\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.890\nI can download and upgrade that firmware\nfor example or whatever the case may be.\n\n319\n00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:11.910\nBut the point is not so\n\n320\n00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.080\nmuch that particular vulnerability,\nit's how do you stay on top of this?\n\n321\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.970\nAnd this is how you do it,\nyou get yourself a little RSS reader and\n\n322\n00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.320\nyou subscribe to these different places.\n\n323\n00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:27.560\nIf I go back out here, let's go to\ntoday and maybe I'll just search,\n\n324\n00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.950\nlet's do this, we'll go to All,\neither way I guess I'm gonna search.\n\n325\n00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:39.910\nSo I'm gonna search for, Sorry I\ncan't type and talk, vulnerabilities.\n\n326\n00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:43.622\nAnd yeah, no don't want worry about that.\n\n327\n00:17:43.622 --> 00:17:45.813\nI don't want to get search.\n\n328\n00:17:48.582 --> 00:17:53.787\nThey just want me to upgrade my platform.\n\n329\n00:17:57.367 --> 00:17:59.628\nLet's do, we'll go to websites.\n\n330\n00:17:59.628 --> 00:18:01.350\nThere we go.\n\n331\n00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.160\nSorry about that.\n\n332\n00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.090\nA little plug for them trying to\nget me to buy the pro version.\n\n333\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.870\nBut here you can see SecurityFocus,\nCERT, Full Disclosure,\n\n334\n00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:13.230\nBugTrax that's a great one,\nZDI, Packet Storm.\n\n335\n00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.250\nIf you're in this field\nyou'll recognize these names.\n\n336\n00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:22.460\nSecurity Research &amp; Defense, information\nfrom Microsoft about vulnerabilities.\n\n337\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:27.400\nAnd all I simply have to do, and hey,\nthat actually sounds like a decent one.\n\n338\n00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.530\nSo let's follow that one.\n\n339\n00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.930\nAll right?\n\n340\n00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:34.184\nI'll add it to my vulnerabilities list and\nnow it shows over here in my feed so\n\n341\n00:18:34.184 --> 00:18:38.503\nwhen I go to this category I'll see them,\nI can pick on that particular one and\n\n342\n00:18:38.503 --> 00:18:40.649\nI can see what they've added lately.\n\n343\n00:18:40.649 --> 00:18:41.433\nSo, that's the idea.\n\n344\n00:18:41.433 --> 00:18:46.847\nUse your RSS readers as your friend, take\nadvantage of the fact that you can get all\n\n345\n00:18:46.847 --> 00:18:52.130\nthat because there's just too many\nsources, too much information out there.\n\n346\n00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.312\nYou could spend,\nit could be your full time job.\n\n347\n00:18:54.312 --> 00:18:56.746\nAnd if you can get a job that\npays you to sit around and\n\n348\n00:18:56.746 --> 00:19:00.832\nread websites on vulnerabilities, let me\nknow about it, I'd like to work with you.\n\n349\n00:19:00.832 --> 00:19:04.860\n[LAUGH] But unfortunately there is\nnot too many of those out there so\n\n350\n00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.403\nthis way I can get all the information\npipped right to me in a timely fashion\n\n351\n00:19:09.403 --> 00:19:11.960\nwithout having to do a lot of extra work.\n\n352\n00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.710\nSo take advantage of those\nvulnerability feeds.\n\n353\n00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.060\nI think we've already talked about\ncredentialed versus non-credentialed\n\n354\n00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.390\nscans but let's refresh,\nlet's make sure we covered that.\n\n355\n00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:30.450\nWhen you're doing a vulnerability scan,\nif you don't provide it any credentials,\n\n356\n00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:35.100\nit's gonna be looking at it from\nthe outside no rights on the system.\n\n357\n00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.210\nAnd that'll give you one point of view as\nto what vulnerabilities that system has.\n\n358\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.900\nBut it's not gonna be very thorough,\nright.\n\n359\n00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.830\nIt does give you a good accurate\nrepresentation of what say a bad actor or\n\n360\n00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.560\nan internal threat that\nhas credentials but\n\n361\n00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.710\nnot the appropriate credentials,\nwhat they might see.\n\n362\n00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.190\nWhich is always good to know.\n\n363\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:00.380\nI wanna see that point of view, but\nI would also like to have a more in depth\n\n364\n00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.910\npoint of view, of hey, even if you had\nadministrative access, what would you see?\n\n365\n00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.290\nOr if you did have administrative access,\nwhat would you see?\n\n366\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.790\nOr you might have systems that\nrequire credentials to connect to them\n\n367\n00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.730\nbefore the scan will even function.\n\n368\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:17.900\nSo most of these vulnerability scanners\nwill allow you to store credentials.\n\n369\n00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.530\nAgain it might be one of those\ncriteria that you look for\n\n370\n00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:26.040\nwhen you're deciding to get or\npurchase a vulnerability assessment tool.\n\n371\n00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.450\nIs does it allow for credentialed scans?\n\n372\n00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.580\nIf I can do credentialed scan, is there\nany reason to do a non-credentialed scan?\n\n373\n00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.090\nThe credentialed scan\nshould show you everything.\n\n374\n00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:40.520\nThe non-credentialed scan,\nwhat you can do without credentials.\n\n375\n00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.640\nSo in theory, the credentialed\nscan is really all you need to do.\n\n376\n00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.010\nBut in my personal opinion, and\nmany security professionals out there,\n\n377\n00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:53.880\nit's always a good idea,\nyou can't be thorough enough, right?\n\n378\n00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.490\nSo run the non-credential scan as well.\n\n379\n00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.260\nMaybe not as frequently, right?\n\n380\n00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.590\nI don't need to do that\nevery time I do a scan.\n\n381\n00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.820\nI'm doing credentialed scans,\nand that's good enough.\n\n382\n00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.765\nBut every so often,\n\n383\n00:21:03.765 --> 00:21:08.980\nI throw in a non-credentialed scan,\njust to see what the bad actors might see.\n\n384\n00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.420\nBecause if something pops up there,\nI definitely wanna focus in on that.\n\n385\n00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:17.399\nIt might help me prioritize the risks\nthat I'm having to deal with because\n\n386\n00:21:17.399 --> 00:21:20.468\nthose are the ones I\nreally need to fix quick.\n\n387\n00:21:20.468 --> 00:21:23.318\nBecause anybody can see them,\nI don't even have to have an account or\n\n388\n00:21:23.318 --> 00:21:26.465\ncredentials to get access to that\ninformation, find that vulnerability,\n\n389\n00:21:26.465 --> 00:21:27.980\npotentially take advantage of it.\n\n390\n00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.915\nSo yes, you probably should do both,\nmaybe not as frequently though,\n\n391\n00:21:32.915 --> 00:21:35.971\nyou can mix up the schedules\non those there.\n\n392\n00:21:35.971 --> 00:21:40.080\nTypes of data, again this is something\nthat we've kind of hinted at already.\n\n393\n00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.000\nWe talked about data classification and\n\n394\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.200\nwe realized that certain types\nof data is more sensitive, and\n\n395\n00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.130\ncan be more damaging if leaked,\nor ex-filtrated than others.\n\n396\n00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.900\nSo, we definitely wanna\npay attention to that.\n\n397\n00:21:54.900 --> 00:22:01.090\nWe wanna maybe run more frequent scans on\nsystems that host information like that.\n\n398\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:06.054\nSensitive information rather than\nlike my workstation for example,\n\n399\n00:22:06.054 --> 00:22:08.670\nthat really doesn't have any data.\n\n400\n00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.610\nI've got a couple VMs on here.\n\n401\n00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:16.390\nMost of my documents if not all are stored\nlocally on a NAS or out in the cloud.\n\n402\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:21.600\nAnd so not a lot of sensitive\ninformation stored on my laptop.\n\n403\n00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.070\nDoesn't mean I'm not gonna check it.\n\n404\n00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.930\nRight, because again it is my laptop.\n\n405\n00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.050\nIt has a VPN connection back to work,\nfor example.\n\n406\n00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.220\nSo if somebody was to get physical access\nto this, if there was some exploit\n\n407\n00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:35.140\nthat allowed them too gain remote access\nto my system, then maybe they could\n\n408\n00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.320\nturn around and use my VPN to connect\nback to work and compromise systems here.\n\n409\n00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.370\nSo it's not that I wouldn't pay\nattention to my laptop, for example,\n\n410\n00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:47.670\nbut places where sensitive information\nis stored is definitely gonna be\n\n411\n00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.050\na little higher on my priority list,\nall right?\n\n412\n00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.820\nThe other thing I wanna talk about here,\nprobably the last thing for this one,\n\n413\n00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:58.660\nis server-based versus agent-based, right?\n\n414\n00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.960\nAnother decision or another deciding\nfactor, I guess, when you're purchasing or\n\n415\n00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.500\nlooking into purchasing, or acquiring\nvulnerability scanning software is,\n\n416\n00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.940\nis it a server-based system,\nis it agent-less?\n\n417\n00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.460\nWhen we talk about server-based,\nagent-based,\n\n418\n00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.060\nagent-less based, how does it run?\n\n419\n00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.420\nIs this something we have to\ninstall on a machine locally and\n\n420\n00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.760\nthen run it from there?\n\n421\n00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.990\nOr is this a server that I set up that\ncan reach out across the network and\n\n422\n00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.140\nscan remote machines?\n\n423\n00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:32.450\nWhich is really what most of them are, or\nat least the ones that I, myself, use.\n\n424\n00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.761\nBut, that make a difference to you.\n\n425\n00:23:33.761 --> 00:23:34.820\nDo I have a server that I can run that on?\n\n426\n00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.936\nAm I looking for something that I can just\ninstall on all my sales people's laptops\n\n427\n00:23:38.936 --> 00:23:42.875\nthat they take traveling with them, so\nthat when they come back I can run a quick\n\n428\n00:23:42.875 --> 00:23:45.220\nlocal vulnerability scan and\nbe done with it.\n\n429\n00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.090\nHow do I want to set that up?\n\n430\n00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.580\nIf its agent less versus agent-based.\n\n431\n00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.790\nNow if it's agent-based, that means it's\ngot something running locally on each\n\n432\n00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.050\nsystem that reports back to, usually\nsome type of centrally managed server or\n\n433\n00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.310\ncentral management server for\nthat particular product.\n\n434\n00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.750\nIs that something I wanna deal with?\n\n435\n00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.240\nI have to, one,\nget that part of my image or\n\n436\n00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.260\nfigure out some way to get that\npushed out to all my nodes.\n\n437\n00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.770\nWhen we bring in new systems,\n\n438\n00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:13.110\nwe have to make sure we're installing\nthat agent versus agent-less.\n\n439\n00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.040\nIt doesn't have the agent running locally.\n\n440\n00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.990\nIt's something that's gonna reach out and\nscan that machine remotely or\n\n441\n00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.730\nagain, just run locally on that system.\n\n442\n00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.660\nBut those are just things\nyou want to be aware of.\n\n443\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.780\nTechnical specifications, the different\ncapabilities of the vulnerability software\n\n444\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.180\nthat if you're part of that decision\nmaking team, you need to be aware of.\n\n445\n00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.780\n&gt;&gt; Lot of great information Mike there.\n\n446\n00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.820\nI know we've got a jam-packed episode\nin this one, but believe it or\n\n447\n00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.260\nnot, we've still have more to go for\nvulnerability management.\n\n448\n00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.870\nBut what we don't have is a lot\nmore time on that clock, so\n\n449\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.730\nit looks like we are going\nto go into a Part 3.\n\n450\n00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.960\nMike, any final words\nbefore we end this one?\n\n451\n00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.440\n&gt;&gt; No,\nwe don't have that much more to go, so\n\n452\n00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.850\nI'm gonna make you wait\nuntil we come back [LAUGH].\n\n453\n00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.700\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nthat's another one of those cliffhangers.\n\n454\n00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.010\nWell Mike, as always we appreciate\nyou being here with us.\n\n455\n00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.100\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer watching!\n\n456\n00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.460\nSigning out for

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:14.782\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.782 --> 00:00:17.590\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.950\nwe are continuing through our series that\nis CompTia's Cybersecurity Analyst+.\n\n7\n00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.980\nAnd joining us back for\n\n8\n00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.490\npart three in vulnerability management\nis none other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.190\nMike, welcome back.\n\n10\n00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.830\nHow you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.660\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.570\nThanks for having me back, excited to\nbe here as we continue on our talk,\n\n13\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.700\nas you said, in vulnerability management.\n\n14\n00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.490\nAnd you did mention, this is part three,\nso if you missed part one and two,\n\n15\n00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.770\nmake sure you go back and\ncheck those guys out.\n\n16\n00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.200\nSo we're going to just jump right back\ninto vulnerability management as we\n\n17\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.200\nkind of wrap this topic up here again I've\ngot some demonstrations coming your way\n\n18\n00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.010\nwhere I show you a couple of these\nvulnerability scanners in action,\n\n19\n00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.900\nsome of the options that they have.\n\n20\n00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.757\nWell for now, the next thing I\nwant to talk about is something\n\n21\n00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:04.540\nknown as SCAP, or\nthe Security Content Automation Protocol.\n\n22\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.880\nThis is a protocol put out by NIST,\nthe National Institute of Standards and\n\n23\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.790\nTechnology here in the US.\n\n24\n00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.370\nAnd the idea is that it's going to allow,\nand I'm reading right from their page.\n\n25\n00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.180\nIn fact, if you wanna pull this up\nreal quick, I can show everybody.\n\n26\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.160\nThis is their page for SCAP.\n\n27\n00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.945\nSynthesis of inter-operable\nspecifications derived from\n\n28\n00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:30.315\ncommunity ideas,\nif you can read that there.\n\n29\n00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:33.815\nThe idea behind SCAP, well,\nlet me just back up for a second.\n\n30\n00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:35.545\nBecause you might be thinking\nwell wait a second Mike,\n\n31\n00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:37.815\nwe've already gone through\nall those regulations.\n\n32\n00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:40.285\nThis is just another regulation.\n\n33\n00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:41.315\nIt's not a regulation.\n\n34\n00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:43.811\nThat's why this is kind of in\na different section or area.\n\n35\n00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:48.250\nThis is an, I cannot talk,\nit's been a long day.\n\n36\n00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.260\nIt's not a regulation it's guidelines or\nspecifications that we can use.\n\n37\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.960\nAnd why?\n\n38\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.930\nWhat is it for?\n\n39\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.020\nThe name security content\nautomation protocol.\n\n40\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.980\nWhat the heck?\n\n41\n00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.650\nThis is designed to allow organizations\nto share security related information.\n\n42\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.270\nWhen we talk about an organization getting\nbreached and they do their research and\n\n43\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.660\nthey find out what was vulnerable.\n\n44\n00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.120\nWhat exploit was used to capitalize on\nthat vulnerability, how did they get in?\n\n45\n00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.560\nWhat techniques did they use?\n\n46\n00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.460\nHow can I protect my network from going\nthrough what you just went through, right?\n\n47\n00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.400\nWe need to share that information.\n\n48\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.530\nBut it hasn't been that way,\nbecause when we look at the way\n\n49\n00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.540\norganizations deal with security breaches,\nthey don't like to share a lot of that.\n\n50\n00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.880\nAnd it's not so\nmuch because they don't wanna share.\n\n51\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.420\nIt's more about because they don't\nwant the information getting out.\n\n52\n00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.820\nI recently got back from\nRSA conference 2017.\n\n53\n00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.390\nAnd one of the big things\nthat you heard over and\n\n54\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.310\nover again was its big data,\nbig data is always the new thing.\n\n55\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.425\nGetting in as much\ninformation as we can but\n\n56\n00:02:56.425 --> 00:03:01.490\nit's not just big data, not what you know\nbut what can you do with what you know.\n\n57\n00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.980\nAnd what I can do with what I know\nis a lot more if I get every,\n\n58\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.510\nif everybody is working together and\nwe're sharing this information and\n\n59\n00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.550\nwe can talk about it and\nfigure out what's going on.\n\n60\n00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.200\nAnd so having some standard or\n\n61\n00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.810\nsome set of guidelines that we can use to\ncommunicate with each other effectively\n\n62\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.400\nis very important especially\nin the world of security.\n\n63\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.960\nBecause there's not a lot of standards and\nwhen I talk about breaches and\n\n64\n00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.840\nWes talks about breaches we might\nnot be using the same terms.\n\n65\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.470\nWe end up using different terms that\nmeans the same thing, bad actor,\n\n66\n00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.290\nthread actor, hacker,\njust for a simple example.\n\n67\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.450\nWhat do you call the bad guy that\nbroke into your network, right?\n\n68\n00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.110\nEverybody's got a different term for it.\n\n69\n00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.310\nAnd again, that's a very high level,\nsimple example.\n\n70\n00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.135\nBut that's the kind of thing that\nSCAP is designed to help with,\n\n71\n00:03:45.135 --> 00:03:50.015\na way to share information about breaches\nin a standardized way, if you will.\n\n72\n00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:51.395\nAgain, it's not a standard.\n\n73\n00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:57.245\nIt's a series of specifications and\nguidelines that we can use.\n\n74\n00:03:57.245 --> 00:04:04.390\nBut it allows me to talk to those other\nsecurity guys in the same field as me.\n\n75\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.610\nAnd discuss breaches and\n\n76\n00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.050\nwithout, with being able to communicate\nusing the same terminology.\n\n77\n00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.200\nAnd also what information I can\ngive out that is not going to\n\n78\n00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.490\nrelease any information\nfrom my organization.\n\n79\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:23.150\nYeah, one of the vendors at\nthe conference was doing a talk and\n\n80\n00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.670\nhe was with the major\nworldwide hotel chain.\n\n81\n00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.710\nAnd he said once a month him and eight\nother security professionals from other\n\n82\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.950\nhotel chains get together, and they sit\naround, and they talk about things they've\n\n83\n00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.760\nseen, what they faced, what they've\ndone about it, things they plan to do.\n\n84\n00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.150\nAnd they're all competitors,\nbut they've made an agreement.\n\n85\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.060\nThey said we're not gonna compete\nwhen it comes to security\n\n86\n00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.580\nbecause a breach in your\norganization can impact us.\n\n87\n00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.770\nAnd if they breach the organization,\n\n88\n00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.810\nthere's a good chance they\nmight be coming from us next.\n\n89\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.950\nCuz we're seeing that the bad guys\nare getting very good at what they do,\n\n90\n00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.690\nand they're also targeting\nspecific industries.\n\n91\n00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.080\nIf you're good at breaking\ninto financial institutions,\n\n92\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.550\nif that bad guy, that's his thing, he's\nnot gonna go hit a hotel chain tomorrow,\n\n93\n00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.780\nright, he's gonna find another\nfinancial institution.\n\n94\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.910\nSo these people decided, hey,\nwe're gonna get together and\n\n95\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.320\nwe're gonna discuss this like\na little round table once a month.\n\n96\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.730\nProtocols like this are designed\nto help with that so\n\n97\n00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.610\nthat we can communicate effectively.\n\n98\n00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.670\nThat we can share information\nabout a breach but\n\n99\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.360\nyet, not give away any personally\nidentifiable information, right.\n\n100\n00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.720\nI've got customer data that I want to\nbe able to share information about this\n\n101\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.740\nbreach but, I gotta make sure that\nyou don't see customers' names and\n\n102\n00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.648\nSocial Security numbers and\nthings like that.\n\n103\n00:05:34.648 --> 00:05:36.550\nIf I'm gonna report\nthis to the government,\n\n104\n00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.020\nI want their help in trying to figure out\nwhat happened and capturing this person.\n\n105\n00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.140\nHow do I do that?\n\n106\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.540\nHow do I give them information,\n\n107\n00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.310\nyet maintain a sense of\nprivacy in a lot of that data.\n\n108\n00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.700\nProtocols like this are gonna help.\n\n109\n00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.180\nThere's one that they don't mention\nin this particular set of objectives,\n\n110\n00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.910\nbut I wanna throw it out there anyway\njust because I like you guys, and\n\n111\n00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.480\nI feel like you should know about this.\n\n112\n00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.850\nAnother set of specifications that's\nbeing released, it's about US-CERT And\n\n113\n00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.010\nlet me zoom in just a little bit cuz it's\nawfully small, TAXIIs and STIX and CybOX.\n\n114\n00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.600\nTAXII, T-A-X-I-I, Trusted Automated\nExchange of Indicator Information,\n\n115\n00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.380\nand STIX, the Structured\nThreat Information Expression.\n\n116\n00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.200\nAnd then CybOX,\nthe Cyber Observable Expression.\n\n117\n00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.230\nAll three of these are really\ndesigned around the same concepts.\n\n118\n00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.495\nHow can I share security\nbreach information,\n\n119\n00:06:28.495 --> 00:06:34.970\ncybersecurity information, in a way that\neverybody is on the same page, right?\n\n120\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.595\nUsing the same language, the same markup,\nbeing able to discuss that and\n\n121\n00:06:39.595 --> 00:06:44.370\nat the same time making sure that we're\nnot giving away any information that\n\n122\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.900\nshouldn't be,\nthat needs to be maintained secretly.\n\n123\n00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.940\nWell not secretly, but\nprivacy issues and things like that.\n\n124\n00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.660\nSo SCAP is one of those,\nanother one, TAXII and\n\n125\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.659\nSTIX are a couple more that we really\nshould be familiar with and looking into.\n\n126\n00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.920\nExecuting scans, we're do that.\n\n127\n00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.010\nI'm just going to do a demonstration for\nyou.\n\n128\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.680\nWe're going to throw up, I think I'll take\nMicrosoft's baseline security analyzer,\n\n129\n00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.540\nas well as another one, Nessus.\n\n130\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.030\nProbably run through a couple simple\n\n131\n00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.720\nvulnerability scans just\nto show you how they go.\n\n132\n00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.010\nSo executing scanning is just\nunderstanding your product,\n\n133\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.819\nknowing what its capabilities are,\nconfiguring it.\n\n134\n00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.760\nFor example, a lot of those scanners\nhave policies that they use\n\n135\n00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.600\nwhere you can define what it's\nlooking for, how it's going about it,\n\n136\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.050\nwhether it stores credentials,\nreport capabilities,\n\n137\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.810\nhow it's going to generate reports and\nthings like that.\n\n138\n00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.685\nAnd reports, I think we've already\ntalked about this in a previous episode.\n\n139\n00:07:41.685 --> 00:07:47.280\nBut reports are very important for\npresenting the information in the end.\n\n140\n00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.950\nWhen we do vulnerability scans and\nassessments on our system,\n\n141\n00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.990\nwe're gonna take that information and\nwe're gonna analyze it.\n\n142\n00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.210\nWe're gonna figure out what we need to do.\n\n143\n00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.817\nWe'll prioritize it based on critical and\nnon-critical systems and\n\n144\n00:07:58.817 --> 00:08:01.700\nrisk factors associated\nwith those vulnerabilities.\n\n145\n00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.339\nImpact of that risk.\n\n146\n00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:07.737\nBut then we need to present this\nsomebody cuz most likely our solution,\n\n147\n00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:12.820\nmaybe we wanna implement a new system\nthat's gonna help keep our network secure.\n\n148\n00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.280\nOr it's gonna patch up against\na certain vulnerability.\n\n149\n00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.110\nOr we're gonna upgrade hardware to\nprevent a certain type of exploit.\n\n150\n00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.890\nA lot of these has to be made not at our\nlevel as IT guys we can present this\n\n151\n00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.420\ninformation to the C level people,\nthe decision makers.\n\n152\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.752\nThe ones that are providing\nthe money to purchase and\n\n153\n00:08:27.752 --> 00:08:30.301\nimplement these different products and\ntechnologies.\n\n154\n00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:35.150\nWell, when you go into those meetings,\nyou're not going in there saying, yeah IP\n\n155\n00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.863\naddress 10.1.2.3 has a vulnerability\non port 22 if we're not using,\n\n156\n00:08:39.863 --> 00:08:42.100\nthey don't care about that, right?\n\n157\n00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.940\nThese are stakeholders,\nthese are the C level executives.\n\n158\n00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.990\nThey need that information but\nnot quite at that detail.\n\n159\n00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:54.010\nSo having reported capabilities that can\nput it into something as presentable,\n\n160\n00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.200\ncan kinda summarize that information.\n\n161\n00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.540\nThat's what I wanna be able to do.\n\n162\n00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.970\nAnd so making sure the product you pick\nhas the features you need, very important.\n\n163\n00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.480\nA lot of these products\ncan do scheduled reports.\n\n164\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.618\nYou might have scans that run\nevery hour on certain systems but\n\n165\n00:09:09.618 --> 00:09:13.052\nit generates one report\na day kind of summarizing.\n\n166\n00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:15.470\nI don't need eight, 12 reports every day,\n\n167\n00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.830\nI just need one report that\nkinda summarizes all of that.\n\n168\n00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.960\nSo whether or\nnot it has those type of capabilities,\n\n169\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.870\ndelivery methods does it email them to me?\n\n170\n00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.520\nDoes it put them in sheer somewhere\nwhere I can go and access?.\n\n171\n00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.175\nOr gonna make them available, does people\nsend reports directly out via email\n\n172\n00:09:34.175 --> 00:09:38.255\nto all of our C level executives or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n173\n00:09:38.255 --> 00:09:42.015\nUnderstanding certain products, different\nproducts have different capabilities.\n\n174\n00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:44.955\nThese are things that you have\nto research to see if you need.\n\n175\n00:09:44.955 --> 00:09:47.575\nAnd then when you go to\npurchase a product, whether or\n\n176\n00:09:47.575 --> 00:09:52.275\nnot that product supports what you need,\nall right?\n\n177\n00:09:52.275 --> 00:09:54.055\nWhat else do I want to talk about here.\n\n178\n00:09:54.055 --> 00:09:54.985\nI'm about to the end.\n\n179\n00:09:54.985 --> 00:10:00.280\nDifficulty of implementation is also\nsomething that we want to think about.\n\n180\n00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.950\nA lot of these are very simple,\n\n181\n00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.120\nlike Microsoft's baseline security\nanalyzer, free download from Microsoft.\n\n182\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.000\nI can download it in about a minute,\nand I can have it running,\n\n183\n00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.360\nand done with a scan within five minutes,\nall right?\n\n184\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.750\nVery easy.\n\n185\n00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.590\nThis is a server based system that has\nagents that need to be deployed out on\n\n186\n00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.790\nthe different systems.\n\n187\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.830\nI've got to configure them.\n\n188\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.800\nI've got to decide what information those\nagents are going to be reporting back.\n\n189\n00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.800\nI've got to maybe configure firewall\nrules to allow that reporting process.\n\n190\n00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.720\nA lot more complex to implement but\nmaybe it has those advanced\n\n191\n00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.980\nfeatures that I really need that\na simpler program might not do, right.\n\n192\n00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.700\nSo it might be another decision factor,\nhow complex is it?\n\n193\n00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.130\nDo we have the IT staff to support this?\n\n194\n00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.380\nRight, somebody's gotta get it installed.\n\n195\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.250\nSomebody's gotta maintain it, make sure\nit's working, doing its job, update it.\n\n196\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.530\nIf I'm the only person in\nthe shop I might go for\n\n197\n00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.620\na simple one because I can't spend\nall my time running that one thing,\n\n198\n00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.780\nI still have to do The other 999 tasks\nthat are on my to do list every day.\n\n199\n00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.120\nDeciding whether you want\nto go with that complex or\n\n200\n00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.600\na more simple type of\nvulnerability scanner.\n\n201\n00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.610\nAnd also trying it out in a sandbox or\n\n202\n00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.380\na test environment is another good thing,\nright.\n\n203\n00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.700\nHow much resources is it going to take up.\n\n204\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.700\nIf I run a scan on that machine, that\nmachine's a production server I can't suck\n\n205\n00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.700\nup all of its resources, kill of its CPU\nand network bandwidth, because then all\n\n206\n00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:32.430\nof a sudden, it can't do its normal job,\nor it's gonna do a poor job of it.\n\n207\n00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.380\nBasically committing a denial\nservice on my own server\n\n208\n00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.500\nby running a vulnerability scan.\n\n209\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.950\nOr is it a little more friendly, are there\nways that I can tune that to slow the scan\n\n210\n00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.490\ndown a little bit, so that it doesn't take\nup all the resources on those machines.\n\n211\n00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.530\nThese are the things that I want to look\nat when I'm purchasing these products.\n\n212\n00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.560\nCan I fine-tune this?\n\n213\n00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.830\nAnd testing is very\nimportant to figure out.\n\n214\n00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.660\nThe salespeople, I'm not saying\nthe salespeople are bad, but\n\n215\n00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.850\nthey're gonna tell you what\nyou want to hear, right?\n\n216\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.050\nI mean you don't put on\nthe back of the box,\n\n217\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.730\nthis will consume 98% of your CPU cycles.\n\n218\n00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.660\nThey're not gonna put that back there.\n\n219\n00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.440\nIt's not a very good selling point.\n\n220\n00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.300\nSo I might need to test that and\nmake sure of what it's doing,\n\n221\n00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.860\nwhat its capabilities are.\n\n222\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.280\nScanning known vulnerable\nmachines is another thing.\n\n223\n00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.270\nIs it gonna catch this vulnerability,\n\n224\n00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.600\nputting it through its paces,\nthings like that.\n\n225\n00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.250\nSo sandbox testing, definitely important.\n\n226\n00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:29.110\nSome other terms that they seem to throw\nin here that I wanna mention, MOUs and\n\n227\n00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.898\nSLAs.\n\n228\n00:12:29.898 --> 00:12:37.150\nMOU is a gosh, brain cramp here.\n\n229\n00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.940\n&gt;&gt; Memorandum of understanding.\n\n230\n00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.710\n&gt;&gt; That's why I keep this guy around.\n\n231\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:41.850\nHe's brilliant.\n\n232\n00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.910\nAnd he loves his acronyms, too.\n\n233\n00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.810\nMemorandum of understanding, right?\n\n234\n00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.315\nYes, thank you, phew!\n\n235\n00:12:48.315 --> 00:12:53.835\nA memorandum of understanding is\nan agreement between one or more parties,\n\n236\n00:12:53.835 --> 00:12:57.973\nit can be bilateral, multilateral\nagreement between one or more parties.\n\n237\n00:12:57.973 --> 00:13:06.185\nBut a non-legally binding agreement\nis really what an MOU comes down to.\n\n238\n00:13:07.405 --> 00:13:13.080\nA couple of organizations that want to\ncreate an agreement they have the same\n\n239\n00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.170\ncommon line of action, its usually a term\nthey'll use when they define this.\n\n240\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:23.440\nBut they wanna come to have\nan agreement but not legally binding.\n\n241\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.160\nAnd not that they don't want a legal\nbinding agreement, this is a really,\n\n242\n00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.540\nI was finding it funny when you go and\ndo a research on an MOU,\n\n243\n00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:36.330\nthey'll say it's a more formal\ngentleman agreement, all right.\n\n244\n00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.850\nIs how they like to define it.\n\n245\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.550\n&gt;&gt; One of the ones I always, I catch the,\n\n246\n00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.660\non the definition is the fact that\nin different countries, right?\n\n247\n00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.350\nDifferent countries have\ndifferent legalities and laws.\n\n248\n00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.340\nAnd those laws, when you're talking about\ntwo different countries meeting together,\n\n249\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.860\nreally probably aren't\napplicable to each other.\n\n250\n00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.340\nSo, for ambassadors, embassies, they have\nto come up with these memorandums of\n\n251\n00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.130\nunderstanding because like here in the US,\nwe're not gonna turn around and\n\n252\n00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.520\nwrite that in the Constitution, so\nit's like legally binding for us.\n\n253\n00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.390\nBut we might have to have some\nkind of way, even if it is just\n\n254\n00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:11.050\njotting it down over a couple of drinks on\na piece of paper or a napkin, if you will.\n\n255\n00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.020\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and that's a great example.\n\n256\n00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.610\nIt's typically the one I use,\nas multinational agreements where\n\n257\n00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.230\nthere is no way for\nus to have a legally binding contract.\n\n258\n00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.440\nBecause there's no enforcement.\n\n259\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.050\nI can't force my laws on them.\n\n260\n00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.770\nI can't bring them over to our\ncourt system and vice versa.\n\n261\n00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:32.570\nSo, how do we have an agreement that's\na little more than just a handshake?\n\n262\n00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.740\nWe want something in writing a little\nbit more formal than that but\n\n263\n00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.690\nwe can't create a legally\nbinding contract.\n\n264\n00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.290\nThat's where your MOUs\nare going to come into play.\n\n265\n00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.700\nSo that's a great example.\n\n266\n00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.920\nBut it's not the only place.\n\n267\n00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.860\nIt could very well be\nbecause you don't want to go\n\n268\n00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.840\nthrough the legal expense right?\n\n269\n00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.740\nI don't want to hire a team of\nlawyers to draw up this agreement.\n\n270\n00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.640\nIt's me and you Wes.\n\n271\n00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.760\nWe're buddies.\n\n272\n00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.790\nWe've done business for several years.\n\n273\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.700\nAnd we're gonna have this\nmemorandum of understanding.\n\n274\n00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.940\nI'm not gonna go out and\nhire a bunch of lawyers so\n\n275\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.600\nwe can draw up some legal contract,\nwe just need the MOU, right?\n\n276\n00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.810\nI mean that's all I need.\n\n277\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.720\n&gt;&gt; You know in the days of our fathers and\nour grandfathers here at least here\n\n278\n00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.830\nin the states maybe you've\nheard this saying before.\n\n279\n00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.861\nYou are as good as your word,\nyour bond, a handshake.\n\n280\n00:15:13.861 --> 00:15:16.456\nMight be the replacement for\nthe early replacement for\n\n281\n00:15:16.456 --> 00:15:18.997\nwhat we consider MOUs today\nbecause of the fact that,\n\n282\n00:15:18.997 --> 00:15:22.836\nlike my grandfather was in business in the\ntire company and when he made a deal with\n\n283\n00:15:22.836 --> 00:15:25.772\nanother competitor or\nsomebody that was supplying product,\n\n284\n00:15:25.772 --> 00:15:28.950\na lot of times they didn't have to\ncome up with a written contract.\n\n285\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.290\nHe'd say, I'll shake your hand.\n\n286\n00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.360\nAnd that ended up becoming a memorandum\nof understanding our MOU if you will.\n\n287\n00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.650\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n288\n00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.860\nAnd another one we mentioned there was\nthe SLA or Service Level Agreement.\n\n289\n00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.240\nMost likely, I was gonna say everyone but\nwe know we can't say that,\n\n290\n00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.850\nmost of you out there have\ndealt with some type of SLA.\n\n291\n00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:52.110\nWe see these all the times, with say,\ninternet service provides, telcos.\n\n292\n00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.903\nAnytime you've got a service,\nthat's being provided,\n\n293\n00:15:54.903 --> 00:15:57.418\nyou'll typically have\na service level agreement.\n\n294\n00:15:57.418 --> 00:16:01.807\nBecause this SLA or Service Level\nAgreement is a binding contract\n\n295\n00:16:01.807 --> 00:16:06.593\nthat allows us to define What,\nsay the quality and the availability and\n\n296\n00:16:06.593 --> 00:16:10.360\nthe responsibilities of\nthe different parties are.\n\n297\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.908\nUsually it's the service provider saying,\nlook, we will guarantee you\n\n298\n00:16:14.908 --> 00:16:20.090\n99% up time, that the quality is\ngoing to be at such a level for\n\n299\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.870\nthis particular service,\nthat's an SLA that we'll agree upon.\n\n300\n00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.240\nSimilar, not really an EULA, where\nthat's an end user license agreement.\n\n301\n00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:36.165\nBut an SLA is usually when\nyou're consuming a service.\n\n302\n00:16:36.165 --> 00:16:39.415\nI was trying to think of\na quick example here with Cox.\n\n303\n00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:42.035\nCox Communications is my ISP here in town.\n\n304\n00:16:42.035 --> 00:16:45.465\nThere's an SLA that I've signed,\nI might not have read the thing but\n\n305\n00:16:45.465 --> 00:16:48.565\nI've signed it when I signed up for\ntheir service and in there.\n\n306\n00:16:48.565 --> 00:16:52.395\nI know, again, haven't read it,\nI'm guilty, but\n\n307\n00:16:52.395 --> 00:16:57.965\nI know in there there's clauses that say,\nyou're on the advanced tier plan and\n\n308\n00:16:57.965 --> 00:17:01.990\nthis is gonna be the bandwidth that\nwe're gonna guarantee you to have.\n\n309\n00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.570\nAnd if,\n\n310\n00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.740\nin the event that we cannot provide that,\nthis is what we're gonna do for you.\n\n311\n00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.590\nWe'll dock your bill so much or whatever,\nbut there's gonna be provisions in there\n\n312\n00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:15.010\nfor hey, this is what you should expect,\nor what you can expect from us.\n\n313\n00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.800\nThis is how we plan on providing it.\n\n314\n00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.680\nThis is what'll happen if\nwe don't provide that.\n\n315\n00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.480\nAnd it's not just to protect me,\nit's to protect them as well, right?\n\n316\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.010\nI can't go in there and say no you told me\nI'm going to have this all the time and\n\n317\n00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:30.510\nnow I'm really upset and\nI'm going to take you to court.\n\n318\n00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.320\nThey can pull out that SLA and say, look\nwe told you it would be 99, not 99.9 or\n\n319\n00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.850\n999 or anything like that.\n\n320\n00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:41.445\n99, that gives us Is how many hours to\nnot provide that service, in a sense.\n\n321\n00:17:41.445 --> 00:17:44.495\nSo that's what an SLA is all about.\n\n322\n00:17:44.495 --> 00:17:47.885\nWe've already talked about\norganizational governance.\n\n323\n00:17:47.885 --> 00:17:50.755\nWell, we talked about the regulations.\n\n324\n00:17:50.755 --> 00:17:53.870\nWe said that there's\ngovernmental regulations.\n\n325\n00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.470\nThere's industry regulations.\n\n326\n00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.270\nThere's also corporate regulations.\n\n327\n00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.180\nI don't think I mentioned this,\n\n328\n00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.930\nbut we should be aware of those\naren't the only levels, right?\n\n329\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.350\nYou might have local regulations,\nstate regulations, county regulations.\n\n330\n00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.340\nI mean, all of this goes back to\nyour due diligence and making sure.\n\n331\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.700\nIn the IT security world,\nthere's not as much at those levels, but\n\n332\n00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.220\nit is something we should be aware of.\n\n333\n00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.180\nBut back to the organizational governance,\ncorporate governance.\n\n334\n00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.950\nIt's just what are corporations?\n\n335\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:25.320\nThe rules we've set into place to run\nour business right and how we plan on\n\n336\n00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:32.430\nimplementing those procedures,\nthose policies for our organization.\n\n337\n00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:37.410\nWhen we have a breakdown of that we get\nan interruption in our business process.\n\n338\n00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:43.150\nAnd this is typically because\nwe have a disconnect maybe,\n\n339\n00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.280\nbetween the operational processes and\n\n340\n00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.750\nthe capabilities of the technology\nthat we're implementing.\n\n341\n00:18:51.575 --> 00:18:53.795\nAnd I couldn't think of\nan example before the show.\n\n342\n00:18:53.795 --> 00:18:57.885\nI know I've dealt with some of these and\nprobably most of you have.\n\n343\n00:18:59.095 --> 00:19:01.555\nI was trying to think\na meeting that we're having.\n\n344\n00:19:01.555 --> 00:19:04.025\nWe're all gonna be\nconferencing in together.\n\n345\n00:19:04.025 --> 00:19:07.105\nWe've got our office here, we've got\none in San Francisco we've got one\n\n346\n00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.955\nin New York, we've got one over in London.\n\n347\n00:19:09.955 --> 00:19:13.640\nAnd we're all gonna be conferencing in and\nhaving this big important meeting and\n\n348\n00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.520\nthe office in San Francisco can't connect,\nand\n\n349\n00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.620\nsomething like that happens there'd be\nan interruption in our business process.\n\n350\n00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.000\nAnd maybe it was because\nthe technology we were using\n\n351\n00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.440\nonly supported three-calls instead\nof four, tying in four offices.\n\n352\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.490\nYou know, again, lame example I know but\nI'm trying to think on the fly there.\n\n353\n00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:37.390\nBut the idea is that we need to\nbe familiar with business process\n\n354\n00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.290\ninterruption, the concept of that.\n\n355\n00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:43.860\nAnd making sure that we do what we\ncan to prevent that type of thing.\n\n356\n00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.100\nWhich really means taking a look\nat our business processes,\n\n357\n00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.610\nhow the technology is\nintertwined in those.\n\n358\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.590\nIn making sure that our technology\ncan provide the solution.\n\n359\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.760\nSometimes the people\nthat make these processes\n\n360\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.660\naren't the ones that are real familiar\nwith the technology we have in place and\n\n361\n00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.150\ndon't understand its capabilities.\n\n362\n00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.870\nThat's when it's our job to step in and\nsay, we need to, or\n\n363\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:10.780\nthis is what it's capable of It's just not\npossible to do what you're trying to do,\n\n364\n00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.590\nit's never gonna work.\n\n365\n00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:16.630\nOr yes that can work, if we up our number\nof licenses and increase our bandwidth, or\n\n366\n00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:17.270\nsomething like that.\n\n367\n00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.250\nSo that would be that concept.\n\n368\n00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:25.150\nLast thing I really wanna talk about is\nongoing scanning and continuous monitoring\n\n369\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.880\nI've already talked about how this\nneeds to be a part of a schedule.\n\n370\n00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.720\nThis is something that there is no set,\ndo this once a day, type thing.\n\n371\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.010\nBut as an organization, and\nthe IT staff, and the C levels.\n\n372\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:42.090\nYou get everybody together and you decide\non what that frequency is going to be.\n\n373\n00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.310\nBut it does need to be an ongoing process.\n\n374\n00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.320\nEverybody out there,\nI'm sure, is aware of it.\n\n375\n00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.980\nComputers change, at a very fast pace.\n\n376\n00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.160\nTechnology changes, we're always\nimplementing new technologies.\n\n377\n00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.890\nWe're updating our existing technologies.\n\n378\n00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.420\nWe're changing configurations on systems.\n\n379\n00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.440\nAny of those can change our\nvulnerabilities, right?\n\n380\n00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.050\nYou introduce a new system, we need\nto make sure we take a look at that.\n\n381\n00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.560\nWe need to scan.\n\n382\n00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:14.030\nIf we change configurations How does\nthat change my vulnerabilities?\n\n383\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.840\nI need to make sure that\nwe update our information,\n\n384\n00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.350\nthat we run scans after major changes.\n\n385\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:24.830\nAnd again, just on a regular basis\nto make sure that we're current.\n\n386\n00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.790\nKeeping those vulnerability scanners up\nto date and then making sure that we run\n\n387\n00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:34.170\nscans frequently to catch things that\nare changing and that are updating.\n\n388\n00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.160\nAnd then just continuous monitoring.\n\n389\n00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.680\nYou can't forget.\n\n390\n00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.720\nYou can't say, yeah,\nI'll do that next month.\n\n391\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.050\nIt really has to be an ongoing process,\n\n392\n00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.850\npart of your normal routine again\nI'm not gonna say daily routine.\n\n393\n00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.160\nBut it does need to be\nsomething that you do a lot.\n\n394\n00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.910\nSo a lot of information.\n\n395\n00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:57.420\nNow when it comes to vulnerability\nmanagement a lot of things to think about\n\n396\n00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.560\nall the way from picking the software\nthat you wanted to use to do this\n\n397\n00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:06.250\nto implementing a schedule to learning\nhow to interpret the results.\n\n398\n00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:10.470\nTo presenting that information back to\nthe people that need the information to\n\n399\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:11.790\nmake those decisions.\n\n400\n00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.590\nSo, it's a little more than\njust going out there and\n\n401\n00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.840\ngrabbing a scanner and running it.\n\n402\n00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.660\n&gt;&gt; And from security to secure,\nthat's for sure.\n\n403\n00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.780\nIt is a journey to be traveled upon,\nnever a destination that you will reach.\n\n404\n00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.460\nNow, it does look like that we are coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n405\n00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.060\nBut before we do, Mike,\nAny final things that you might like to\n\n406\n00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.430\nthrow in there when it comes to\nthings like vulnerability management?\n\n407\n00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.830\nSome of the concepts\nthat we've talked about?\n\n408\n00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.790\n&gt;&gt; You know I think we've covered it and\nthen some.\n\n409\n00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.360\nSo I'll just leave it at that and\n\n410\n00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.690\nwe'll do a couple of demonstrations here\nto show you a couple of these scanners.\n\n411\n00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:42.350\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Mike thank you for\nbeing here and we appreciate it as always.\n\n412\n00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:45.400\nAnd we appreciate you the viewer\nwatching Signing off for IT Pro TV,\n\n413\n00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.880\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n414\n00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.800\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roger.\n\n415\n00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.131\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n416\n00:22:49.131 --> 00:22:59.131\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:12.340\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.320\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.440\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.190\nin today's episode we are back\nWith more of our CSA Plus series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.810\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio\nto lend his expertise on that very topic,\n\n9\n00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.590\nour good friend, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.270\nMike, welcome.\n\n11\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.090\nHow goes it today?\n\n12\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.030\n&gt;&gt; It goes well, Daniel,\nthanks for asking.\n\n13\n00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.920\nThanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.960\nSo in this one, vulnerability scanning\nis what we're gonna be talking about it.\n\n15\n00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.030\nAnd I know we've talked a little\nbit about it in other episodes.\n\n16\n00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.560\nThe objective here from comp tm,\n\n17\n00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.040\nanalyze the output resulting\nfrom a vulnerability scan.\n\n18\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.940\nWe've talked about vulnerability scan.\n\n19\n00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.470\nWe've talked about the different scanners\nthat are available, some free, some paid.\n\n20\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.310\nWe also talked about the fact\nat the end they basically have\n\n21\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.590\na set of known vulnerabilities.\n\n22\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.040\nSignatures for those vulnerabilities.\n\n23\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.780\nThey're gonna scan a system,\n\n24\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.500\nsee if your system matches\nany of those vulnerabilities,\n\n25\n00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.440\ngive you a report, and then that's\nwhere the work comes in, right?\n\n26\n00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.580\nThe scanning part is the easy part cuz\nyou just point it to the IP address and\n\n27\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.700\nyou say, here, go.\n\n28\n00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.130\nAnd assuming you have network connectivity\nand if there's any credentials required\n\n29\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.090\nyou provide those,\nit does all the hard for for you.\n\n30\n00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.240\nThen we've got to go back and we've got to\ntake a look at those results and try and\n\n31\n00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.150\nfigure out what we can do with them.\n\n32\n00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.520\nSo that's what we're going to\ndo in this particular episode.\n\n33\n00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.170\nSo, what I've done here, you know\nwhen we talk about analysing reports,\n\n34\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.000\nwe're gonna take a look\nat one in just a second,\n\n35\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.160\nbut we look at analysing reports\na couple things that we're gonna want to\n\n36\n00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.200\nbe able to do, identify false\npositives Is gonna be one of them.\n\n37\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.730\nIdentify exceptions,\nthat would be another one.\n\n38\n00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.150\nAnd prioritize response actions.\n\n39\n00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.300\nSo really three things we wanna hit when\nit comes to interpreting our scan results.\n\n40\n00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.290\nLet's talk about that first one,\nidentify false positives.\n\n41\n00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.000\nSo if we're gonna\nidentify false positives,\n\n42\n00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.519\nthen we kinda need to know\nwhat a false positive is.\n\n43\n00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.130\nAnd that's where we'll start.\n\n44\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.710\nWhat is a false positive?\n\n45\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.670\nFalse positive means your scanner has told\nyou there is a vulnerability that your\n\n46\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.250\nsystem does have this vulnerability and\nthat's not true.\n\n47\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.420\nIt's lying to you.\n\n48\n00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.720\nAnd I say it's lying to you it's not\nreally something has triggered it\n\n49\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.980\nto make it think that your\nsystem has it's vulnerability.\n\n50\n00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.830\nSomehow your system matches that,\nthat what it's looking for\n\n51\n00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.335\nthat figure of vulnerability and\nif you don't know that you don't have,\n\n52\n00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:28.995\nI'm trying to think of a good example.\n\n53\n00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:30.595\nAnd there's not a lot.\n\n54\n00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:33.375\nYou don't see that, well actually, I\nshouldn't say you don't see it that often.\n\n55\n00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:35.945\nBut I can't think of one off the top\nof my head, a real world example.\n\n56\n00:02:35.945 --> 00:02:39.905\nBut let's imagine, for example,\nif you will, that my vulnerability scanner\n\n57\n00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:45.035\ncomes back and says, hey, you\nare vulnerable to cross-site scripting.\n\n58\n00:02:45.035 --> 00:02:47.470\nWell, my server's not running a website.\n\n59\n00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.080\nSo I'm pretty sure that I'm not vulnerable\nto that cross ad scripting, right?\n\n60\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.060\nBut it told me I was.\n\n61\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.180\nThat would be false positive.\n\n62\n00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.580\nNow, what do we do?\n\n63\n00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.300\nHow do we run, identify those and\n\n64\n00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.260\nhow do we figure out that the false\npositives couple of ways?\n\n65\n00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.100\nOne, my silly example that I just used.\n\n66\n00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.870\nIf you're not running a web server,\n\n67\n00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.308\nyou can be you can be pretty sure\nthat that's a false positive, right?\n\n68\n00:03:08.308 --> 00:03:12.000\nYou can't be vulnerable to that\nif you don't have a website up.\n\n69\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.120\nAnother way to do it and\n\n70\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.580\na better way to do it is to\nactually use multiple scanners.\n\n71\n00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.510\nThis is something that we should do.\n\n72\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.130\nEven if we might go out as an organization\nand buy a really good scanner.\n\n73\n00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.730\nPay for a license for it cuz of the great\nfeatures, because of the great support,\n\n74\n00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.320\nthe reporting capabilities.\n\n75\n00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.190\nWe don't want to despair any expense.\n\n76\n00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.660\nWe want to ahead and\npop the whole kit and caboodle.\n\n77\n00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.880\nIt doesn't mean it probably we wouldn't\nuse an open source for free scanner.\n\n78\n00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.180\nJust kinda verifies some of\nthose results now and again.\n\n79\n00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.240\nAnd see if we are getting\nany of those false positive.\n\n80\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.440\n&gt;&gt; So, you get yourself\nsecond opinion as it were.\n\n81\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.910\nExactly right, why not have some other\neyes look at it and see, especially if you\n\n82\n00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.190\nsee one that you're almost positive can't\nbe true, you know, that'd be a good idea.\n\n83\n00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.850\nNow that being said,\nmost of these vulnerability\n\n84\n00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.610\nscanners that you're paying for,\nI mean they're pretty accurate and\n\n85\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.130\nyou're not going to get a whole\nlot of false positives.\n\n86\n00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.480\nThis isn't like a learning system or\na behavioral-based intrusion prevention.\n\n87\n00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.800\nWhere there's no baseline,\nhas to learn everything and\n\n88\n00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.600\nyou're gonna get tons of false positives\nand eventually you'll start learning what\n\n89\n00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.090\nthose are, marking them and\nit'll stop flagging those, right?\n\n90\n00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.070\nThen false positives are expected.\n\n91\n00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.120\nHere, I've got a database\nof vulnerabilities and\n\n92\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.350\nI'm scanning the system and\nit either matches or it doesn't.\n\n93\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.150\nSo, you don't see that\nmany false positives.\n\n94\n00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.370\nRight?\nExceptions would be the next one that we\n\n95\n00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.030\nwant to talk about.\n\n96\n00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.770\nExceptions are if, you know I've seen\nthis vulnerability come up in a report.\n\n97\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.570\nWe look at it.\n\n98\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.540\nWe do our risk analysis and\nwe make our little matrix and\n\n99\n00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.450\nwe figure what the likelihood\nof this threat occurring and\n\n100\n00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.530\nwhat the impact of that would be on our\nsystems, on our network, or what have you.\n\n101\n00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.970\nAnd we've decided that it's a one,\nit's at the bottom of the scale, right?\n\n102\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:03.880\nVery low impact, very low likelihood\nof actually being exploitive, right.\n\n103\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.310\nThat would be one that I might say,\nyou know what, we're okay,\n\n104\n00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.570\nwe're just going to accept that risk.\n\n105\n00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.900\nOr maybe we've done something\nto prevent that risk,\n\n106\n00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.840\nor some other risk mitigation technique,\nbut my vulnerability scanner still\n\n107\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.540\npops it as a vulnerability, even though\nwe've already seen it, analyzed it,\n\n108\n00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.500\ndone what we wanted to do as\nan organization and we're okay with that.\n\n109\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.040\nWell, it keeps coming up every time.\n\n110\n00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.660\nIn my reports I see all these machines\nare listed as vulnerable to this and\n\n111\n00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.320\nit's throwing off my information.\n\n112\n00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.770\nMy data is now incorrect.\n\n113\n00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.180\nSo, what I need to do is\ncreate an exception and\n\n114\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.600\nwe do that within\nthe vulnerability scanner itself.\n\n115\n00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.540\nWe can go in and tell it,\nwe know about this one.\n\n116\n00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.810\nWe've done what we wanted to do.\n\n117\n00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.250\nWe don't want it to pop up\nin the reports anymore, so\n\n118\n00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.730\nwe're gonna make an exception for that.\n\n119\n00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.870\nYou might have a scenario where\nyou’ve got an application and\n\n120\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.760\nit’s an old application and only accepts\nbasic authentication of playing text and\n\n121\n00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.950\nthat all you can do but it’s in house\nit’s not exposed to the outside.\n\n122\n00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.500\nSo the risk of somebody grabbing\nthose credentials is relatively low,\n\n123\n00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.310\nsafer to other employees so\nwe've decide that we are okay with that.\n\n124\n00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.940\nWe don't have anybody\nto rewrite the program,\n\n125\n00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.040\nno way to update the authentication so\nwe're just gonna have to deal with that,\n\n126\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.220\nand take other methods to\nmitigate against that risk.\n\n127\n00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.890\nWe're gonna do heavy logging on there,\nwe're gonna audit.\n\n128\n00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.690\nWe're constantly looking at\nthose logs to see if anybody's\n\n129\n00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.970\nlogging in with accounts when those people\naren't here, or whatever the case may be.\n\n130\n00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.010\nWe've done other things to deal with that.\n\n131\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.890\nSo now, I just need to tell my\nvulnerability scanner, it's okay,\n\n132\n00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.240\nwe know about that one,\nplease don't tell us about it anymore.\n\n133\n00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.189\nSo that'd be your exceptions.\n\n134\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.110\nAnd then prioritize response action.\n\n135\n00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.960\nWell that's, again,\n\n136\n00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.100\ndoing our risk assessment and\ndeciding which ones we need to focus on.\n\n137\n00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.150\nWhich ones are those high impact, high\nrate of occurrence type vulnerabilities.\n\n138\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.710\nThose are the ones I want to deal with.\n\n139\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.910\nThe ones that are going to\ncost me the most money or\n\n140\n00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.900\nresources If it does come to a fruition.\n\n141\n00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.580\nOr it's going to bring my network down for\nlong time.\n\n142\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.330\nOr it happens all the time and I've got\nto stop this, high rate of occurrence.\n\n143\n00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.960\nThose are the ones I wanna spend my\neffort, my resources, and my money on.\n\n144\n00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.870\nSo, I'm gonna start there.\n\n145\n00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.090\nDoesn't mean I'm gonna\nignore the rest of them.\n\n146\n00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.393\nIt just means we're gonna prioritize.\n\n147\n00:07:11.393 --> 00:07:12.980\nYou can't fix everything at once.\n\n148\n00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.120\nOne step at a time, going through these\nthings, and that's the way you do it.\n\n149\n00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.270\nYou start with your initial report.\n\n150\n00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.290\nYou got all kinds of red flags on there\nand you just start at the top and\n\n151\n00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.250\nyou just go through them and\nslowly get them patched up and fixed.\n\n152\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.840\nRight?\nAnd that's the great thing about a lot of\n\n153\n00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.810\nthe vulnerability scanners is they do\na lot of the prioritization for you.\n\n154\n00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:36.370\nNow, you don't have to believe or go with\nthat you might have a different scale.\n\n155\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.640\nYou still want to do your own\nprioritization, but it will say look\n\n156\n00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.780\nthese are severe, these are the ones\nthat you probably should focus on.\n\n157\n00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.945\nAnd then and as an organization, we get\nto decide are we of the same mind set?\n\n158\n00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:49.757\nDo we consider those severe or\n\n159\n00:07:49.757 --> 00:07:53.384\nthat ones very very very low\nlikelihood of ever happening.\n\n160\n00:07:53.384 --> 00:07:58.160\nSo, even though it's a high risk or it's\na a high impact We're okay with putting\n\n161\n00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.494\nthat a little further down on the list.\n\n162\n00:08:00.494 --> 00:08:04.255\nSo it's not like you just blindly\nfollow your vulnerability scanner, but\n\n163\n00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:07.550\nit does give you an idea of where\nto start in your prioritization.\n\n164\n00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.710\nAll right Daniel, so let's take a look\nat a vulnerability scanner, shall we?\n\n165\n00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.280\n&gt;&gt; So let's do it.\n\n166\n00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.180\nThis is a visual format, and so\nit does help to actually see things.\n\n167\n00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.780\nMike, what have you got queued up for us?\n\n168\n00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.930\n&gt;&gt; Wait, they can see us out there?\n\n169\n00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:20.900\n&gt;&gt; Then can see us, yeah.\n\n170\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.770\n&gt;&gt; Wait, what?\n\n171\n00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.480\nYeah I know.\n\n172\n00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.155\nI'm so sporesols.\n\n173\n00:08:23.155 --> 00:08:24.701\n&gt;&gt; Gosh.\n\n174\n00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:26.053\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I thought this was radio, I swear.\n\n175\n00:08:26.053 --> 00:08:28.433\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's take a look,\n\n176\n00:08:28.433 --> 00:08:31.140\nlet's take a look at my screen here,\nand we will see what we've got.\n\n177\n00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.560\nI've got Nexpose installed, fired up.\n\n178\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.140\nNow I'm not showing you\nthe install process.\n\n179\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.630\nI've got the community\nedition running here which is\n\n180\n00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:44.270\nfreely available from Nexpose, you just\nhave to register and get yourself a key.\n\n181\n00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.630\nBut the install takes a while,\nbecause it's got to install a program, and\n\n182\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.590\nthen it's the downloading of\nall of its definitions and\n\n183\n00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.160\nall of that that's gonna take a while.\n\n184\n00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.840\nSo, in my VM it took even longer than it\nwould maybe on a nice physical machine.\n\n185\n00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.780\nI think I've given this\nguy eight gigs of RAM and\n\n186\n00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.000\nit still starts to choke a little bit.\n\n187\n00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.300\nSo anyway, it's already installed,\nready to go.\n\n188\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.870\nWhen you go to connect to that, we can see\nI've just gone to HTTP colon slash slash\n\n189\n00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:17.940\nlocal host, colon thirty seven\neighty is the default URL.\n\n190\n00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.760\nYou can change that during\nyour installation if\n\n191\n00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.080\nyou had something else\nrunning on that port.\n\n192\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.190\nYou also have to pay attention,\nanother gotcha for this particular one,\n\n193\n00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.570\nremember this is not a platform dependent\ntest or if it's vendor neutral so\n\n194\n00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.080\nI doubt they'd ask anything about this.\n\n195\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.580\nBut do keep in mind like the database\nit's gonna do a post risk database.\n\n196\n00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.206\nDo pay attention to what port\nnumber that's on because you\n\n197\n00:09:40.206 --> 00:09:41.210\nhave something else running on it.\n\n198\n00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.186\nI installed on Kali Linux which is\nalso running that Metasploit and\n\n199\n00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:49.588\nit just happens to use the same\ndefault port for its database, 5432.\n\n200\n00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:53.573\nSo, if I was to install Nexpose and not\npay attention to that, there's gonna be\n\n201\n00:09:53.573 --> 00:09:57.333\na conflict, and we're gonna have issues,\nand it's not gonna work, so.\n\n202\n00:09:57.333 --> 00:10:00.597\nAdded a 1 to it, 54321.\n\n203\n00:10:00.597 --> 00:10:04.880\nJust make sure it's a unique port that\nnothing else on your system is using.\n\n204\n00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.800\nYou also create an account during the\ninstallation, which I have already done.\n\n205\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.304\nSo I'll go ahead an authenticate and\nwe'll log into our console here and\n\n206\n00:10:12.304 --> 00:10:13.688\nwe'll see what we've got.\n\n207\n00:10:13.688 --> 00:10:15.914\nI do have an issue with my updates and\n\n208\n00:10:15.914 --> 00:10:20.072\nthat's because my network adapter\non this guy is changing back and\n\n209\n00:10:20.072 --> 00:10:24.620\nforth as I go to my lab and add my\nexternal node and my podium, and my desk.\n\n210\n00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.720\nSo I'm gonna ignore that for now.\n\n211\n00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.045\nIf this was real world, I definitely wanna\nmake sure that it's staying up to date.\n\n212\n00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:33.622\nJust like antivirus software, you've gotta\nhave your latest configs and definitions.\n\n213\n00:10:33.622 --> 00:10:38.172\nAnd I've also done a scan already,\njust because we didn't wanna sit here and\n\n214\n00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:39.645\nwait and watch the scan.\n\n215\n00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:45.840\nBut, let me take a peek,\nwe'll kinda navigate around here.\n\n216\n00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.410\nHere, I can see the,\nI don't have a lot of data.\n\n217\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.850\nBecause I've just installed this\nI've done one or two scans so\n\n218\n00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.500\nI don't have a lot of\ninformation in here yet.\n\n219\n00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.212\nBut I've got three assets and\n\n220\n00:10:56.212 --> 00:10:59.773\nyou see everything was this might\nlittle be there it was in a and\n\n221\n00:10:59.773 --> 00:11:03.699\nI got three because that was my first\nscan before that I had nothing.\n\n222\n00:11:03.699 --> 00:11:08.170\nThen it gives me my risk score,\nwhich was awfully high.\n\n223\n00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.843\nMy highest risks sight was LabNet,\nthat's the only network I've got.\n\n224\n00:11:11.843 --> 00:11:14.146\nLet me zoom back out, here.\n\n225\n00:11:14.146 --> 00:11:20.410\nDown below that, and this is just again,\nthe overview current scan.\n\n226\n00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.430\nSo maybe I'll come back and\ndo a whole episode,\n\n227\n00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.800\nif you guys want, on expose and\nrunning it and getting it configured.\n\n228\n00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.860\nFor now, let's take a look at my\nreports and see what we've got.\n\n229\n00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.810\nSo will flip over to the reports, and\n\n230\n00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.280\nI'm going to do my,\nactually I did run a second one, lets see.\n\n231\n00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.510\nThis is one of the reports.\nYeah, I'll show you that in a minute.\n\n232\n00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.780\nReally what I want to\nshow you is not a report,\n\n233\n00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.630\nlets go to the consul\ntake a look at assets.\n\n234\n00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.570\nAnd then we will come back and\ntake a look at the reports I can generate.\n\n235\n00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.400\nSo I go to assets and this shows me\nbasically a breakdown of what it is found.\n\n236\n00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.050\nAssessment status.\n\n237\n00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.530\nThree of them were assessed.\n\n238\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.920\nTwo were Microsoft, one was Ubuntu.\n\n239\n00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.830\nOne exploitable assets by skill level.\n\n240\n00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:07.370\nThat's kinda cool.\n\n241\n00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:11.260\nIt's telling me that, hey you got one\nmachine that even a novice can get into.\n\n242\n00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.440\nYour other two, no to, no known exploits.\n\n243\n00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.983\nLet's scroll down and\nI can see the list of my machines.\n\n244\n00:12:16.983 --> 00:12:20.840\nOne of them's a domain\ncontroller running 2016.\n\n245\n00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.710\nSo we kinda figured it wouldn't have\ntoo many vulnerabilities, if any.\n\n246\n00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.911\nThe other one is a Windows 10 client, kind\nof the same scenario, pretty up to date.\n\n247\n00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:32.486\nBut the third one was Metasploitable,\nwhich if you're not familiar with\n\n248\n00:12:32.486 --> 00:12:37.130\nMetasploitable, it's an intentionally\nvulnerable Linux server.\n\n249\n00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:41.270\nIt's got most vulnerabilities that you\nknow of are probably in this thing,\n\n250\n00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.770\nespecially web vulnerabilities.\n\n251\n00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:46.140\nSo I can see,\nI'll see if we can zoom in here.\n\n252\n00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.252\nVulnerabilities, that top row?\n\n253\n00:12:47.252 --> 00:12:48.629\n412.\n\n254\n00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:53.590\nSo you can see my risk score 185,315.\n\n255\n00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.010\nAgain, that's awfully high.\n\n256\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:00.140\nEvery risk has an associated value with\nit and then that gets added up and\n\n257\n00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.350\ngives you the risk score.\n\n258\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.510\nAll right, if we were to go click\non my Linux machine down here, and\n\n259\n00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.720\nI could actually click it\non any one of those links.\n\n260\n00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.610\nNow I can see it has a little\nbit more information.\n\n261\n00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.000\nNow let's click on that one more time.\n\n262\n00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.290\nAnd here we'll get the actual report,\nI know that's a little small so\n\n263\n00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.300\nI'm gonna kind of zoom in\nas we navigate around.\n\n264\n00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:25.752\nBut you can see information that's pull\nback: IP address, operating system,\n\n265\n00:13:25.752 --> 00:13:30.738\nlast scan time, vulnerabilities it found,\nthere's again is my score.\n\n266\n00:13:30.738 --> 00:13:36.410\nAnd as we go down I can scroll,\nI'm zoomed in so I have to scroll out.\n\n267\n00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.610\nI can see trend analysis is\nreally not going to be all that\n\n268\n00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.880\nbeneficial because the one scan.\n\n269\n00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.180\nOver time though I can start\nseeing trends in this,\n\n270\n00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.380\nand hopefully slowly see the number\nvulnerabilities in this case going down.\n\n271\n00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.080\nWe get down to here, and\nthis is where the good stuff lies.\n\n272\n00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.364\nThis is the actual vulnerability report\nof where the vulnerabilities are.\n\n273\n00:13:55.364 --> 00:14:00.332\nYou can see I've got a Title,\nI've got CVSS ranking,\n\n274\n00:14:00.332 --> 00:14:05.960\nI've got my Risk Score,\nand then Severity, right?\n\n275\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.340\nAnd then I've got Exceptions, right?\n\n276\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.000\nSo we talked about\nexceptions a minute ago.\n\n277\n00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.940\nIf I think that this is something\nthat we've already dealt with and\n\n278\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.330\nI don't want it to show up any more,\nI can simply click Create Exception.\n\n279\n00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.380\nCome into this window here and\nI cannot zoom ont hat one, I apologize.\n\n280\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.840\nAll instances on this asset or\nall instances, all assets.\n\n281\n00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.140\nMaybe we've got a program that\nwe put as part of our image.\n\n282\n00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.920\nFor all of their client machines and\n\n283\n00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.750\nit has some vulnerabilities that we've\ndealt with and we're not worried about.\n\n284\n00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.510\nAnd I wanna make sure this doesn't\nget flagged on any of my systems.\n\n285\n00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.983\nThen I can set that for all instances.\n\n286\n00:14:39.983 --> 00:14:40.715\nAll right,\n\n287\n00:14:40.715 --> 00:14:45.633\nI will do it because it's definitely not\none that I wanna make an exception for.\n\n288\n00:14:45.633 --> 00:14:48.985\nAll right, this one is actually\nis like an expired certificate.\n\n289\n00:14:48.985 --> 00:14:51.895\nOther cool columns that has here,\nlike this guy is malware,\n\n290\n00:14:51.895 --> 00:14:53.393\nif it thinks it found malware.\n\n291\n00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:57.450\nThis one tells you what\nit's exploitable by.\n\n292\n00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.260\nIn fact,\nthere's a little guide right up here.\n\n293\n00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.210\nYou can see the radioactive icon,\nsusceptible to malware attacks.\n\n294\n00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:09.310\nThe M on the shield there, Metasploit\nexploitable, validated by Metasploit or\n\n295\n00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.190\nExploit published or\nvalidated with published exploit.\n\n296\n00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.990\nSo it's actually tell you, hey,\nthis vulnerability has a known exploit\n\n297\n00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.750\nalready written, a freely available\nin Metasploit for example.\n\n298\n00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.364\nSo if anybody really wanted to that had\nMetasploit, they could just launch and\n\n299\n00:15:23.364 --> 00:15:24.416\nattack your machine.\n\n300\n00:15:24.416 --> 00:15:29.188\nAll right, so pretty nice report\nthat generates, there are a lot,\n\n301\n00:15:29.188 --> 00:15:33.288\nif I take a look at anyone of this,\nlet's go back up here and\n\n302\n00:15:33.288 --> 00:15:39.710\ngrab where's my, Let's find one that's\na little more exciting than some of these.\n\n303\n00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.233\nLet me sort this the other way.\n\n304\n00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:45.250\nYeah, here we go, our log in.\n\n305\n00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.203\nWhich most of us know is\na bad vulnerability and\n\n306\n00:15:47.203 --> 00:15:48.514\nwe don't see it much anymore.\n\n307\n00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:51.487\nBut that exploitable again\nis intentionally vulnerable,\n\n308\n00:15:51.487 --> 00:15:53.869\nso we can pretty much just\nlog into this system.\n\n309\n00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:57.034\nThere's not a lot of Hacking required,\nbut the point is not that\n\n310\n00:15:57.034 --> 00:16:00.860\nparticular vulnerability, or\nMetasploitable, it's this tool, right?\n\n311\n00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.040\nIt's using vulnerability scanners,\nmost of them are gonna do the same thing,\n\n312\n00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.600\nI can click on that vulnerability and\nI can come in here and\n\n313\n00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.276\nI can get some more information about it.\n\n314\n00:16:09.276 --> 00:16:13.160\nOur Login, Remote Login Service\nis Enabled, Severity Critical,\n\n315\n00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:18.620\nVulnerability ID, there's my CVSS, I can\ngo out and get more information on that.\n\n316\n00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.020\nAs I go down here I can see,\nit will show me if there were other assets\n\n317\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.040\nthat were vulnerable to this,\nit will show them here as well.\n\n318\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:33.545\nLet me zoom back out, we'll get down to,\nit didn't close on original, there we go.\n\n319\n00:16:33.545 --> 00:16:37.501\nWe'll scroll down and\nhere I can see Exploits, and\n\n320\n00:16:37.501 --> 00:16:43.573\nit's actually showing me that I can go\nto this particular Metasploit Module,\n\n321\n00:16:43.573 --> 00:16:47.356\nfire it up and\ncompromise this machine, right?\n\n322\n00:16:47.356 --> 00:16:52.715\nI wanna see what else, and again this\ntool is a vulnerability scanner,\n\n323\n00:16:52.715 --> 00:16:57.984\nI mean it's not meant to be an attack\nplatform but you can see how easily\n\n324\n00:16:57.984 --> 00:17:03.107\nit could be used to assist in\na penetration test or an actual attack.\n\n325\n00:17:03.107 --> 00:17:03.617\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n326\n00:17:03.617 --> 00:17:06.779\ncuz you'd be able to take the output\nof what we're seeing on the screen and\n\n327\n00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:09.970\nsay, these are the vulnerabilities\nI found on machine x, y, and z.\n\n328\n00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.455\nAnd then use that and say,\nokay well I'm going to now,\n\n329\n00:17:12.455 --> 00:17:16.260\nnow that I now they're there,\nI can go down that road and okay,\n\n330\n00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.030\nthat's rlogin version whatever and\nthat's super exploitable.\n\n331\n00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.050\nLet me look up an exploit for\nthat and make my attack.\n\n332\n00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:25.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you start grabbing SearchSploit,\nor you go out to the Exploit Database\n\n333\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:30.100\nonline, or Metasploit online, and\nyou do a search for rlogin exploits and\n\n334\n00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.392\nyou see what you've got,\nsee what you can find.\n\n335\n00:17:32.392 --> 00:17:36.936\nThis one will actually take you, if I\nclick on one of these guys it takes me out\n\n336\n00:17:36.936 --> 00:17:40.550\nto the Vulnerability &amp; Exploit Database.\n\n337\n00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:44.075\nShows me the module where it's\nlocated within Metasploit.\n\n338\n00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.480\nIt gives me a little help on how I might\nuse that exploit, we'll launch that.\n\n339\n00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.460\nSo maybe as an admin if this\nis in a sandbox environment,\n\n340\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.160\nmaybe I wanna test it out and\nsee if I'm truly vulnerable to this, or\n\n341\n00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.240\nwhat they would see if they took\nadvantage of this particular exploit.\n\n342\n00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.750\nIn this case it'd be a bad thing,\nbecause they would basically\n\n343\n00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.960\nlog in to your system and have a show, but\nit shows you down here at the bottom too.\n\n344\n00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.670\nHow do you fix this?\n\n345\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.585\nIt's not gonna leave you in the dark and\nsay,\n\n346\n00:18:11.585 --> 00:18:14.320\nman you've got all these\nvulnerabilities you're in trouble.\n\n347\n00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.958\n[LAUGH] It's like,\ndisable the rlogin service, disable or\n\n348\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:22.982\nfirewall this service\nwhich usually runs on 513.\n\n349\n00:18:22.982 --> 00:18:28.120\nSo I'm like okay I need to go turn off\nour login, that's what I need to do.\n\n350\n00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.380\nIf I absolutely need that service then\nI need to bring up a firewall and\n\n351\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.860\nmake sure we're doing what we can to\n\n352\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.070\nonly allow traffic on that port from our\ninterior subnet, whatever the case may be.\n\n353\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:43.120\nBut it gives you ways to go about fixing,\nor it gives you suggestions,\n\n354\n00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.560\nI guess, on how to do that.\n\n355\n00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.600\nAnd if I go back out to\nthe vulnerabilities,\n\n356\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.330\nwe talked about prioritization.\n\n357\n00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:57.320\nAs I look at these vulnerabilities there's\nones that are listed as Critical and\n\n358\n00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.730\nthis is a sortable list.\n\n359\n00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:02.429\nI can click on this and sort that so\nthese are the Moderate, and\n\n360\n00:19:02.429 --> 00:19:04.430\nI just flipped the search order.\n\n361\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.080\nSo those are Moderate, but the ones I'm\ngonna want to start with are these ones\n\n362\n00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.533\nthat are Critical and it looks like\nI've got quite a few to go through.\n\n363\n00:19:13.533 --> 00:19:17.550\nSo we've talked about, let me just\nzoom in a wee bit for you there.\n\n364\n00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.340\nYou can see that column\nwhere it says Critical,\n\n365\n00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.330\nthose are the ones I wanna deal with first\nor that's where I'm gonna start my list.\n\n366\n00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.270\nThis is what we've got to work on,\nstart doing my research,\n\n367\n00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.270\nclicking on each one of these one\nat a time, finding out what it is.\n\n368\n00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.090\nAnd if there's any suggestions on\nhow to fix it, or going out and\n\n369\n00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.710\ndoing my due diligence,\n\n370\n00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.760\nmy own research, figuring out what it\nis I can do about it to prevent that.\n\n371\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.720\nAnd then, of course, re-running these\nscans and making sure that what we've\n\n372\n00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.580\ndone has fixed the vulnerability and\nit no longer shows up on this report.\n\n373\n00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.230\nWe'll see those risk scores go down,\n\n374\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.350\nwe'll see the total number of\nvulnerabilities start dropping down.\n\n375\n00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:56.620\nWe'll start seeing trends where we've\ngot a little downward spiral, or\n\n376\n00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.840\ndownward slide,\non our vulnerabilities and our risk, so\n\n377\n00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:06.520\nthat's what we're trying to do with this.\n\n378\n00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.278\nWe've looked at validating the results,\nwe mentioned a little bit getting\n\n379\n00:20:11.278 --> 00:20:16.010\nanother scanner, or actually trying to\ntake advantage of the vulnerability.\n\n380\n00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:20.420\nAnd that's something that you can do,\nnot on your production machines,\n\n381\n00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:25.045\nlet's not exploit our own machines,\nunless that's your method, I don't know.\n\n382\n00:20:25.045 --> 00:20:29.528\n[LAUGH] Maybe some networks,\nbut typically what you gonna\n\n383\n00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:32.960\nwanna do is make a copy of that machine,\nvirtualize it, have a little\n\n384\n00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.230\nsandbox environment that you can set up\nand launch these exploits against it.\n\n385\n00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.311\nI mean they've pretty much\ngiven you the information\n\n386\n00:20:40.311 --> 00:20:43.460\nyou're gonna need to\nfire off that exploit.\n\n387\n00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:47.000\nLet's see what happens, let's test it,\nlet's make sure that it is true.\n\n388\n00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.810\nWe might have some other mitigation\ntechnique in place that even though\n\n389\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:54.340\nthe scanner sees it as as a vulnerability,\nbecause of all the things we're doing\n\n390\n00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.540\nwe're not gonna be vulnerable to it,\nright?\n\n391\n00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:01.440\nSo maybe it's, I guess, a false positive\nand I don't have to worry about that.\n\n392\n00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.710\nSo this is why we wanna validate, make\nsure we're correlating with any other data\n\n393\n00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.660\npoints that we might have\nfrom our Seam system, right?\n\n394\n00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.763\nPulling in all that big data from\nour routers, and our switches and\n\n395\n00:21:12.763 --> 00:21:14.330\nour server logs.\n\n396\n00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.610\n&gt;&gt; Makes a great point of thinking about\n\n397\n00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:22.630\nwhere you actually perform the scan may\nimpact what results you get from the scan.\n\n398\n00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:27.320\nIf I'm outside of a trusted network, maybe\nmy scan results come back differently than\n\n399\n00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.590\nthey do when I'm inside\nof the trusted network.\n\n400\n00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.520\nMaybe I've acted as someone who's\nwalked in and attached to the wireless,\n\n401\n00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.520\nor plugged into a port\nin the wall somewhere.\n\n402\n00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.310\nThat might give me a whole\nlot of different information\n\n403\n00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.010\nthan it would if I was outside on\nthe Internet trying to actively come at\n\n404\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.380\nonly Internet facing devices,\nit definitely makes a difference.\n\n405\n00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.680\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, these are all things,\nvery great points and\n\n406\n00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.450\nthings that we've gotta consider\nwhen we're looking at our results.\n\n407\n00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.910\nSo reconciling the results,\n\n408\n00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:58.110\nagain if you're running more than one\nScanner, seeing how they compare.\n\n409\n00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.760\nAs we've just said reviewing logs at\nthe data sources and then trends.\n\n410\n00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.000\nTrends are the other one we wanna\nhopefully make sure that our trends\n\n411\n00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.730\nare going in the right direction, and\nI can't really show you any kind of\n\n412\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.660\ntrending information here because\nit's a new network and so\n\n413\n00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.430\nthere's not a lot of information.\n\n414\n00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:20.060\nBut the idea is if I'm running these scans\nonce a day or once every other day, and\n\n415\n00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:25.580\nwe're actively prioritizing and working on\ngetting rid of and mitigating those risks,\n\n416\n00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.140\nthen I should definitely see\na downward slope in that information.\n\n417\n00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.010\nI should see fewer and\nfewer vulnerabilities coming up,\n\n418\n00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.380\nI should see my pie charts\nlooking better and better, right?\n\n419\n00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.840\nWe're looking for those trends there,\nbecause I wanna make sure we're\n\n420\n00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:43.630\ngoing in the right direction, or the other\ncase is this is, we've done all of this.\n\n421\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.270\nWe've got our network the way we want it,\nwe protect it, but\n\n422\n00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.460\nwe continually scan cuz there's always\nnew vulnerabilities coming out.\n\n423\n00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:53.230\nNew software's getting installed, things\nare getting reconfigured, we're adding new\n\n424\n00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.140\nnodes, new servers, new end points,\nnew inter-connectivity devices.\n\n425\n00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.820\nSo we're continually scanning and maybe\nwe start seeing that going back up, and\n\n426\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.145\nwe have to do our research and\nfigure out what is it?\n\n427\n00:23:03.145 --> 00:23:07.385\nAnd one user found this tool that\nthey think is really cool and\n\n428\n00:23:07.385 --> 00:23:10.965\nthey were able to put it on their system,\nand they told their friend and\n\n429\n00:23:10.965 --> 00:23:12.765\ntheir friend was like,\nthat's really cool I wanna use that and\n\n430\n00:23:12.765 --> 00:23:18.605\nthey put it on theirs, and you slowly\nstart seeing this climb up in that.\n\n431\n00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:24.180\nSo again looking at trends is a great\nway to try to see, to make sure you're\n\n432\n00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.750\non the right tract, and to make sure that\nyou're moving in the proper direction.\n\n433\n00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, well there's vulnerability\nscanning wrapped up in a pretty pink\n\n434\n00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.540\npackage for you good people out there.\n\n435\n00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.330\nThat's a lot of p's in that sentence,\n\n436\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.090\n[LAUGH] hearing it out loud\ninstead of just in my head.\n\n437\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.220\n&gt;&gt; You have one more thing?\n\n438\n00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.628\n&gt;&gt; I do, I forgot to go back and\nactually show the reports.\n\n439\n00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:41.393\n&gt;&gt; It's probably a good idea.\n\n440\n00:23:41.393 --> 00:23:42.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm gonna show that.\n&gt;&gt; Probably a good idea.\n\n441\n00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.395\n&gt;&gt; Again, this is not gonna\nbe an exam on the expose, but\n\n442\n00:23:45.395 --> 00:23:49.272\nmost vulnerability scanners, especially\nthe ones that are enterprise level,\n\n443\n00:23:49.272 --> 00:23:51.050\nare gonna be able to create reports.\n\n444\n00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.834\nThis one is no exception,\nand it does a great job.\n\n445\n00:23:54.834 --> 00:23:58.516\nThere's several templates that you can use\nin here, but we've talked about reporting,\n\n446\n00:23:58.516 --> 00:24:00.126\nand the importance of documentation.\n\n447\n00:24:00.126 --> 00:24:03.284\nThis is one, it's the Executive report.\n\n448\n00:24:03.284 --> 00:24:06.754\nAnd this is one that I would bring\nin front of the sea levels, right?\n\n449\n00:24:06.754 --> 00:24:10.981\nWe're gonna leave out a lot of\nthe technical details, we're not gonna go-\n\n450\n00:24:10.981 --> 00:24:11.570\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] pretty colors there.\n\n451\n00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.381\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of colors.\n\n452\n00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:13.425\n&gt;&gt; Keep their attention.\n\n453\n00:24:13.425 --> 00:24:14.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They love that!\n\n454\n00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.170\n&gt;&gt; They do, until they see which\nprinter they're using to print that.\n\n455\n00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.560\nWhy are you wasting all my color?\n\n456\n00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But this is a sea level report,\n\n457\n00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.096\nlet me zoom in.\n\n458\n00:24:22.096 --> 00:24:26.120\nWhoa, little too much there, there we go.\n\n459\n00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.800\nMost common vulnerabilities and\nit's giving me the information there,\n\n460\n00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.710\na little pie chart where\nI've got that information.\n\n461\n00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.630\nHighest risk vulnerabilities.\n\n462\n00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:39.590\nNow I can go to them and I can say, this\nis why we need solution XYZ because it's\n\n463\n00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:45.040\ngonna take care of these three highest\nrisks on the top of this chart, right?\n\n464\n00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.280\nSo now I can convince the C levels\nthat we spend this much money, and\n\n465\n00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.460\nwe can eliminate a ton of our risk.\n\n466\n00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.950\nA good chunk of the risk that we face\ncould be eliminated by simply doing this.\n\n467\n00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.940\nSo this is the kind of report\nthat I wanna bring them.\n\n468\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:58.710\nOops, sorry.\n\n469\n00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:01.670\nBecause they're not.\n\n470\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.490\nOk, we've talked about reporting,\n\n471\n00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.860\nyou always have to know your\naudience when you're reporting.\n\n472\n00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.310\nWhat is they need,\nthe sea level people typical,\n\n473\n00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:10.490\nI'm not saying all of them are like this.\n\n474\n00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:15.850\nBut typically they don't know or\ncare to know that port such and\n\n475\n00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.430\nsuch was left open and\nis vulnerable to this and somebody\n\n476\n00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.540\nwas able to do a little firewall here and\ndo a pivot attack off this machine.\n\n477\n00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.300\nThat's not what they're interested in.\n\n478\n00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.760\nThey're worried about the bottom line,\nthey wanna know what we're gonna do to\n\n479\n00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:34.900\nprevent this, how are we gonna\nsolve this problem, all right?\n\n480\n00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:40.120\nSo really cool reports there, as well as,\nlet's see if I can go grab you one more.\n\n481\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.990\nThe other one that I ran was more of\na top ten assets by vulnerability.\n\n482\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.970\nNow this might be one that\nI schedule to run and\n\n483\n00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.380\nevery Monday morning when I walk in,\nI see this.\n\n484\n00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.140\nSo I know where to start my day.\n\n485\n00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.590\nI might go, okay, this guy's on the top of\nthe list, this is the one we need to go\n\n486\n00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.380\nfigure out why it's so vulnerable,\nwhat's going on there.\n\n487\n00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.140\nSo, lot of cool reporting capabilities,\nsomething that\n\n488\n00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.910\nmost of your vulnerability scanners\nare going to be able to do.\n\n489\n00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:11.820\nBut something that you want to\nlook if you're going to be doing\n\n490\n00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.990\npenetration testing or anything like that,\n\n491\n00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:16.530\nyou definitely want something that\nhas good reporting capabilities.\n\n492\n00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:17.790\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\nWe love the reports.\n\n493\n00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.750\nAnd again, so do our uppers.\n\n494\n00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:25.660\nThey like to see it in a nice drawn out\npicture, all that tech talk you speak,\n\n495\n00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.000\nI don't understand that.\n\n496\n00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.600\nThat graph, I understand.\n\n497\n00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.010\nThat pie chart, I understand that.\n\n498\n00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:33.330\nSo we definitely wanna have those\ndeliverables available for them.\n\n499\n00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:34.230\nAnd it's easy for us too.\n\n500\n00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.630\nIt never hurts for\nus to dumb it down for ourselves.\n\n501\n00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.210\nThat being said, thank you Michael.\n\n502\n00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:39.930\nNow that he's thrown over reporting.\n\n503\n00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.625\nNow we have the pretty pink package.\n\n504\n00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:43.840\n[LAUGH] For you good folks out there.\n\n505\n00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.680\nThat is for vulnerability scanning.\n\n506\n00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.880\nInteresting topic.\n\n507\n00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.480\nGet used to it.\n\n508\n00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.530\nPlay around with different\nvulnerability scanners.\n\n509\n00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.910\nThere's not just one out there and\nthere's plenty of them to get.\n\n510\n00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.850\nMaybe you find one you like\nbetter than the other.\n\n511\n00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.282\nThat's always a good thing to do.\n\n512\n00:26:55.282 --> 00:26:58.010\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n513\n00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:59.500\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n514\n00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.400\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n515\n00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.260\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n516\n00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:08.694\n[MUSIC]\n\n517\n00:27:08.694 --> 00:27:10.620\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

--> 00:00:11.890\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.150\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.510\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.420\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.160\nwe are continuing along that journey that\nis the CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst +.\n\n8\n00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.745\nJoining us back in the studios for\nour part two is none other than Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:25.310\nMike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.380\nMike, how we doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.120\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, Wes,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.430\nAnd yeah, we do have a part two for you.\n\n13\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.548\nA little bit more to do with these\ngood old vulnerability scanners.\n\n14\n00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:33.700\nI've actually got a few more to do.\n\n15\n00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.365\nBut as far as demoing and taking a look at\nit, there is one more I wanna show you.\n\n16\n00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:41.220\nAnd we took a look at the Microsoft\nBaseline Security Analyzer in\n\n17\n00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.600\na previous episode.\n\n18\n00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.010\nSo go back and check that one out.\n\n19\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.200\nThat's a very common one you see\nespecially in our Windows environments.\n\n20\n00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.590\nBut it's definitely not\nthe only one out there.\n\n21\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.280\nAnd there's others that are much\nmore powerful and do a lot more,\n\n22\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.790\nthat actually scan more\nthan just Windows systems.\n\n23\n00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.980\nAnd in today's environments,\nyou really need that.\n\n24\n00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.870\nBut as far as scanning your Windows\nmachines, that's a good one to use,\n\n25\n00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.790\na free one to use.\n\n26\n00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.948\nThis exam is not a Microsoft exam,\nit's not any one product.\n\n27\n00:01:08.948 --> 00:01:11.708\nI know we had a couple questions\nin the chat room about that.\n\n28\n00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:17.380\nAre you gonna need to know MBSA,\nor Nessus, or Saint, or OpenVas?\n\n29\n00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.054\nAnd for the most part, no.\n\n30\n00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:23.190\nI mean they're gonna need, you need to\nknow the concepts of what a vulnerability\n\n31\n00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.340\nscanner does, how they kind of all operate\nin general, looking at the results.\n\n32\n00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.960\nAnd sure,\n\n33\n00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.050\ntheir output is gonna be a little\nbit different from one to the other.\n\n34\n00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.990\nBut it still comes down to some basic\nconcepts of using a vulnerability scanner.\n\n35\n00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.780\nMaking sure it's up to date, scanning your\nmachines, interpreting those results,\n\n36\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.720\nprioritizing the results, right, looking\nat the different vulnerabilities it finds.\n\n37\n00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.590\nAnd some of them, you're gonna be\nlike yeah, that's no concern to us.\n\n38\n00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.730\nThat poses no threat in our environment,\nwe're going to ignore that one.\n\n39\n00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.110\nThat one, on the other hand,\nis a red flag.\n\n40\n00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.350\nAnd we need to do something about it.\n\n41\n00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.990\nBecause we're gonna lose our PCI\nCompliance, or whatever the case may be,\n\n42\n00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.860\nso understanding that.\n\n43\n00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.020\nAnd by going through\na couple of different ones,\n\n44\n00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.928\nit's not that I'm trying to\npoint one out over the other.\n\n45\n00:02:03.928 --> 00:02:06.700\nIt's just that we need to be familiar\nwith what they are, how they work.\n\n46\n00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.950\nSo with that being said,\nlet's take a look at my screen.\n\n47\n00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.690\nAnd we'll just jump right into the next\none I wanna demo, which is Nessus.\n\n48\n00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.760\nAnd Nessus is made by\nTenable Network Security.\n\n49\n00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.730\nAnd it's a very common one out there.\n\n50\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.460\nIt's a very popular one,\nif you've got the pocketbooks for it.\n\n51\n00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.400\nThis is not a free one,\nthis is one you're gonna have to pay for.\n\n52\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.040\nThere is a trial version that you can get.\n\n53\n00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.020\nI've downloaded it from Tenable myself,\nso we can play around with it.\n\n54\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.687\nOther licensing,\ndepending on what you gotta do,\n\n55\n00:02:38.687 --> 00:02:40.210\nyou're gonna have to\ntalk to them obviously.\n\n56\n00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.050\nIt's a couple of thousand dollars a year,\nper license, I believe.\n\n57\n00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.510\nSo it can add up quickly.\n\n58\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.570\nBut definitely something that's worth it,\nif this is what your organization needs.\n\n59\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.330\nNow, I don't have\nan SSL Certificate on this machine.\n\n60\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.636\nIt is a Web-based interface.\n\n61\n00:02:55.636 --> 00:03:00.539\nSo you can see I'm getting a warning\nhere connecting to local host port 8834,\n\n62\n00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.030\nwhich is the default for this one.\n\n63\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.730\nAnd it's telling me, hey,\nyou'd better be careful.\n\n64\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.365\nWell, I know that it's my machine and\nI don't have an SSL certificate.\n\n65\n00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:14.105\nWhen you go through the setup for Nessus,\nit's gonna tell you hey, click here.\n\n66\n00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:17.833\nYou're most likely gonna get a warning\nuntil you install an SSL certificate,\n\n67\n00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:19.425\ncuz it is using HTTPS to protect.\n\n68\n00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:22.115\nI might be connecting\nthis over the network.\n\n69\n00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:23.485\nI don't need other people sniffing or\n\n70\n00:03:23.485 --> 00:03:26.313\ngrabbing these results,\nif you think about it.\n\n71\n00:03:26.313 --> 00:03:29.145\nI mean, Wes,\nwhat would you do if you, well,\n\n72\n00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:30.795\nlet's see what's a better way to ask this.\n\n73\n00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:33.300\nIt's like, if you're a bad guy, and\n\n74\n00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.660\nyou can get somebody's\nvulnerability assessment results.\n\n75\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.840\nHey, it saves you a lot of work, right?\n\n76\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.510\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say.\n\n77\n00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.330\nAll you had to say, Wes, what would you?\n\n78\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.360\nAnd I was already kind of thinking,\nwhat can I do?\n\n79\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.960\nMy first thought is logs.\n\n80\n00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.880\nLogs are gonna contain some kind of\nsensitive information that maybe you only\n\n81\n00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.450\nwant the administrators seeing.\n\n82\n00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you might not have, as a bad\nactor or as an inside threat, you might\n\n83\n00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.870\nnot have administrative access to scan for\nvulnerabilities on that web server.\n\n84\n00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.780\nBut if you can intercept that traffic from\nan admin that did have that capabilities,\n\n85\n00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.590\nnow you can see what\nvulnerabilities are there and\n\n86\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.870\nmaybe launch an attack,\nfind an exploit to take advantage of that.\n\n87\n00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.190\nSo again,\nthey try to keep us safe by using HTTPS.\n\n88\n00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.100\nYou also create an account\nwhen you first set up Nessus.\n\n89\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.420\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nlog in with the account I created.\n\n90\n00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.820\nThis account will have administrative\naccess to the Nessus console.\n\n91\n00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.120\nYou can create additional accounts, for\n\n92\n00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.380\npeople that to just need to run scans\npotentially and things like that.\n\n93\n00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.708\nAgain, this is not here,\nwe're not here to teach you Nessus.\n\n94\n00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:28.810\nI couldn't do it in 30 minutes anyway.\n\n95\n00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.185\nIt's more about just kinda\nshowing you the product or\n\n96\n00:04:31.185 --> 00:04:34.550\nwhat vulnerability scanners are all about.\n\n97\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.722\nSo it's logging in, I think.\n\n98\n00:04:38.722 --> 00:04:39.990\nWe'll find out, maybe it's there.\n\n99\n00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.650\nWe'll try clicking on something,\nall right.\n\n100\n00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.260\nA little bit of a white screen issue,\nbut that's okay.\n\n101\n00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.120\nI'm gonna go, the first thing you need\nto do when you're using Nessus is,\n\n102\n00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.480\nit uses policies.\n\n103\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.670\nPolicies are going to define what it's\nscanning for, things it's looking for.\n\n104\n00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.400\nAnd Nessus has over 70,000 plugins.\n\n105\n00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.380\nSo it's a very robust\nenterprise-level solution.\n\n106\n00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.033\nIf you wanted to do log analysis, if you\nwanted to get plugins to work with your\n\n107\n00:05:06.033 --> 00:05:09.550\nWeb applications, things like that,\nyou can get those.\n\n108\n00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.730\nYou can even write some of your own.\n\n109\n00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.880\nSo it's a very, very powerful solution.\n\n110\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.370\nAs you can see under My Policies,\nI have none.\n\n111\n00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.384\nSo I'm going to go over here and\nclick New Policy.\n\n112\n00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:21.150\nCuz you can't run a scan without a policy.\n\n113\n00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.480\nThe policy is basically\nthe instructions for the scan.\n\n114\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.790\nAnd a lot of these vulnerability\nscanners work this way.\n\n115\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.598\nNow I can see there's a bunch of\ntemplates that I could use as-is.\n\n116\n00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:35.360\nWe can create our own, we can customize\none of the existing templates.\n\n117\n00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.520\nSo I'm just gonna choose\nBasic Network Scan.\n\n118\n00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.600\nIt's a full system scan,\nsuitable for any host.\n\n119\n00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.660\nBut you can see some of the others,\nI'll zoom in a little bit.\n\n120\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.570\nBash Shellshock Detection,\nMalware Scan, PCI Network Scan.\n\n121\n00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.810\nNow you can see the Upgrade flag there\nbecause I am not allowed to do that\n\n122\n00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.690\nwith this particular version of Nessus.\n\n123\n00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.190\nPolicy Compliance Auditing,\nPCI Quarterly External Scans,\n\n124\n00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.150\nif you're a business that you take credit\ncard payments, or you have to deal with\n\n125\n00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.510\nsome of these types of regulations, then\nthis could be an invaluable tool for you.\n\n126\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.100\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say,\nCaptain Obvious here.\n\n127\n00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.140\nI'm coming from the A+.\n\n128\n00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.485\nI'm thinking PCI, why would you\nwant to scan your internal cards?\n\n129\n00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:16.651\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now I get it,\n\n130\n00:06:16.651 --> 00:06:19.995\nit's payment card information\ndata security standard.\n\n131\n00:06:19.995 --> 00:06:22.410\nI caught on after\na little bit on that one.\n\n132\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.814\n&gt;&gt; That's a good one,\nI have to remember that.\n\n133\n00:06:23.814 --> 00:06:24.634\nYeah, I like that.\nYeah, no,\n\n134\n00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:25.805\nwe're not scanning for PCI buses.\n\n135\n00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:27.819\nAlthough, do we have any of those still?\n\n136\n00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:32.850\nYeah, all right, so let me zoom\nback out and get back out here.\n\n137\n00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.640\nAnd I'll choose the template.\n\n138\n00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.593\nAnd once you choose a template,\nthen you can go in and\n\n139\n00:06:38.593 --> 00:06:42.880\nyou can either just leave it as it is or\nyou can begin to customize it.\n\n140\n00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.011\nAnd you can see,\nI'll zoom in for a second.\n\n141\n00:06:44.011 --> 00:06:48.080\nYou've got several settings down\nthe side that I'll be able to click on.\n\n142\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.187\nFill in some information on the right-hand\nside about those different options, and\n\n143\n00:06:52.187 --> 00:06:53.392\nthen save it as a policy.\n\n144\n00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:56.630\nAll right, so I'm going to zoom back out.\n\n145\n00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.230\nAnd I'm going to give it a name.\n\n146\n00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:04.707\nI'll call this one CSA+, and\nwe'll just call it a Test Scan.\n\n147\n00:07:04.707 --> 00:07:09.160\nAll right, and\nthen I can go down to Permissions.\n\n148\n00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.230\nAnd I can choose whether or not I\nwant to do credentialed scans or not.\n\n149\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.524\nI'm going to leave it without,\nI think, for now.\n\n150\n00:07:16.524 --> 00:07:20.367\nCredential versus non-credential\nvulnerabilities scans,\n\n151\n00:07:20.367 --> 00:07:25.515\nif you provide credentials, it can do a\nlittle more in-depth scan of that machine,\n\n152\n00:07:25.515 --> 00:07:30.299\nan account that it can use to access\nservices and other things on that machine,\n\n153\n00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:34.325\nor access web applications,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n154\n00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:37.604\nIf you do a non-authenticated,\nnon-credentialed scan,\n\n155\n00:07:37.604 --> 00:07:38.898\nit has no credentials.\n\n156\n00:07:38.898 --> 00:07:41.380\nSo you think, well,\nwhy would I bother doing that?\n\n157\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.020\nWhy wouldn't I always\ndo a credentialed scan?\n\n158\n00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.090\nReally, you should do both.\n\n159\n00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.740\nIf you have a scanner that allows you to\ndo both, and you've got the manpower and\n\n160\n00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.350\nthe hours to do it, do both.\n\n161\n00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.071\nThe credentialed scans gonna get\neverything because it can use\n\n162\n00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:54.617\nthe credentials where it needs to.\n\n163\n00:07:54.617 --> 00:07:57.521\nAnd then if it doesn't need them,\nit just does the normal scan.\n\n164\n00:07:57.521 --> 00:08:01.339\nWhereas a noncredentialed wouldn't have\nthe ability to do the credentialed\n\n165\n00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:01.876\nportion.\n\n166\n00:08:01.876 --> 00:08:02.508\nKinda makes sense, right?\n\n167\n00:08:02.508 --> 00:08:05.720\nSo again, why would I ever\nwanna do the non-credential?\n\n168\n00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.563\nMaybe I wanna do a black box type test\nwhere I wanna see it from the bad\n\n169\n00:08:10.563 --> 00:08:15.580\nactor's point of view, or\nfrom whatever you wanna call the hacker,\n\n170\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.758\nthe cracker, the bad actor.\n\n171\n00:08:17.758 --> 00:08:19.300\nWanna see it from their point of view.\n\n172\n00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.618\nThey shouldn't have credentials,\nor hopefully,\n\n173\n00:08:21.618 --> 00:08:23.996\nat least they don't have\ncredentials out of the box.\n\n174\n00:08:23.996 --> 00:08:28.072\nSo, what would they see if they do a scan\nbecause those might be the ones I wanna\n\n175\n00:08:28.072 --> 00:08:29.330\nfocus in on first.\n\n176\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.430\nThose are my priorities,\n\n177\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.260\nthe ones that the bad guys can see\nwithout even having credentials.\n\n178\n00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.010\nThe other stuff with credentials\nobviously important that I protect, but\n\n179\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.900\nmaybe that's my next step.\n\n180\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.600\n&gt;&gt; Mike, would this also be good, you\nwere just mentioning real briefly there,\n\n181\n00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.698\nwas a disgruntled employee?\n\n182\n00:08:44.698 --> 00:08:47.770\nMaybe I wanna know what internal standard\nusers you aren't supposed to have\n\n183\n00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.980\nadministrative access,\nwhat they can actually see.\n\n184\n00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.740\nMaybe I'm doing part of that\nas a vulnerability scan.\n\n185\n00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:57.070\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, a good chance to test out,\nimpersonate, possibly.\n\n186\n00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.810\nI'm gonna go down,\nI'm gonna skip the permissions.\n\n187\n00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.400\nI'm gonna go down to Discovery.\n\n188\n00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.970\nAnd you can see I have here scan type.\n\n189\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.210\nLet me expand that out,\nand then I'll zoom in.\n\n190\n00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.261\nPort scan (common ports),\nPort scan (all) or Custom.\n\n191\n00:09:09.261 --> 00:09:10.580\nAnd if I chose Custom,\n\n192\n00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.197\nit would let me put in a range of\nports that I wanted to scan for.\n\n193\n00:09:14.197 --> 00:09:17.500\nI'm just going to leave it on\nthe most common settings here.\n\n194\n00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:22.740\nAny of these that I can, some of them I\ncan chose to customize, some of them not.\n\n195\n00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.132\nDiscovery, if I hit Custom, that's where\nI can choose my own, you'll see that\n\n196\n00:09:27.132 --> 00:09:30.764\nthe list gets a little bit longer\nover here and I can now go in and do.\n\n197\n00:09:30.764 --> 00:09:32.750\nHow do I wanna do the host discovery?\n\n198\n00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.580\nDo I wanna use Ping?\n\n199\n00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.141\nDo I wanna use TCP?\n\n200\n00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:36.670\nDo I wanna fragment?\n\n201\n00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.100\nFor the ports,\ndo I want to do the sim scans?\n\n202\n00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.090\nService discovery?\n\n203\n00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.480\nSo, you can choose to\ncustomize any of this,\n\n204\n00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.200\nI'm gonna change that\nback to just the default.\n\n205\n00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.316\nAnd I won't go through, the rest of\nthem are gonna be the same, right?\n\n206\n00:09:51.316 --> 00:09:55.350\nAssessment, do you wanna do\nknown web vulnerabilities,\n\n207\n00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.960\nall that a quick version\nlike a quick scan.\n\n208\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.000\nComplete, you can customize it.\n\n209\n00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.570\nReporting capabilities.\n\n210\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.500\nHow do I want to that data coming out?\n\n211\n00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.380\nDo I want to show missing patches,\nhide results from plugins initiated\n\n212\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.390\nas a dependency, one plugin that\nwas being called by another plugin.\n\n213\n00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.780\nCan I edit the scan results?\n\n214\n00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.880\nDon't want to see their DNS names.\n\n215\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.630\nWell, a lot of different options there.\n\n216\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.390\nYou get down in the Advanced.\n\n217\n00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:25.440\nWe can choose a few more, scan load,\nbandwidth, lengths, we can do Custom.\n\n218\n00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.335\nSo, I'm gonna pretty much\nleave it the way it is.\n\n219\n00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:28.970\nI give it a name and a description.\n\n220\n00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:33.304\nAnd I'm just gonna click Save, all right.\n\n221\n00:10:33.304 --> 00:10:36.978\nAnd, we'll see how this goes, we'll do\na non-credentialed scan at this one, or\n\n222\n00:10:36.978 --> 00:10:38.250\nshould we do credentialed?\n\n223\n00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.910\nMaybe we should do credentialed,\nwe'll use this one we'll see what happens.\n\n224\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.810\nAnd I can create additional policies,\nyou'll see this policy shows up in\n\n225\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.000\nmy list, so I might have one\nthat I use for my web servers,\n\n226\n00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.800\nanother one that I use for, say,\nDMZ or external resources, limitless.\n\n227\n00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.730\nThen, you go to scans and\nI don't have any scans yet.\n\n228\n00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.310\nSo, I'll go to My Scans and\nI'll click New Scan.\n\n229\n00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.010\nAnd I should have, actually,\nthere we go, my user created policies.\n\n230\n00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.770\nNow notice it brings me\nback to this template.\n\n231\n00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.710\nBecause if I wanted to use\na template the way it was,\n\n232\n00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.010\nI could just simply run\nit from right here.\n\n233\n00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:13.830\nThe idea is,\n\n234\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.260\nif you're gonna do some customization, you\ndon't wanna have to do that every time.\n\n235\n00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.920\nSo, it saves it as a template down here,\nUser-Created Policies.\n\n236\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.670\nI'll choose CSA.\n\n237\n00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.990\nSo, now it knows what template or\nwhat settings I wanna use?\n\n238\n00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.859\nI'll give this a name.\n\n239\n00:11:26.859 --> 00:11:32.508\nI'll say dc01 csa+ for my demo,\nI'll write subscription,\n\n240\n00:11:32.508 --> 00:11:37.535\nI'll leave it blank,\nfolder where do I want to put this?\n\n241\n00:11:37.535 --> 00:11:40.499\nI will put this in My Scans and\nthen my target.\n\n242\n00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:47.187\nI'm gonna do 10.0.100.200, but\nnotice you can also add a file,\n\n243\n00:11:47.187 --> 00:11:52.472\nif you had a list of IP addresses\nmaybe from a scanner, right?\n\n244\n00:11:52.472 --> 00:11:58.867\nYou can use that, I'll click Save and\nnow we're going to run that scan.\n\n245\n00:11:58.867 --> 00:12:02.376\nOops, didn't mean to click there,\nlet me back up one, all right so\n\n246\n00:12:02.376 --> 00:12:06.350\nI've got my scan that I save,\nI told it who I wanna scan, IP address.\n\n247\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.140\nWhat template I wanted to use.\n\n248\n00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.408\nNow, I've got a little play button\nright over here to launch that scan.\n\n249\n00:12:12.408 --> 00:12:13.720\nAnd we'll go ahead and let that run.\n\n250\n00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.091\nIt shouldn't take it too terribly long,\nalthough we never know.\n\n251\n00:12:17.091 --> 00:12:19.769\nAnd while we're letting that run,\n\n252\n00:12:19.769 --> 00:12:24.600\nthis program or Nessus is a very,\nvery enterprised level.\n\n253\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.270\nYou can do scheduled scans,\nmaybe want this run every Friday night,\n\n254\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:33.714\nonce a day, once a week,\nyou can start scheduling these as well.\n\n255\n00:12:33.714 --> 00:12:37.422\nAnd again, these aren't the only ones and\nwhat you should do in your preparing for\n\n256\n00:12:37.422 --> 00:12:39.838\nthis exam is just go out and\nplay with a couple of them,\n\n257\n00:12:39.838 --> 00:12:41.472\nthat's really what you need to do.\n\n258\n00:12:41.472 --> 00:12:46.111\nIf you've got a Microsoft System at home,\nMBSA is really easy one to grab and\n\n259\n00:12:46.111 --> 00:12:48.360\nplay with, and run some scans.\n\n260\n00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.520\nTurn on some extra services and see what\nhappens to your scans results, right?\n\n261\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.947\nDownload a trial of Nessus, if you\nwanna go with the Linux side of things,\n\n262\n00:12:55.947 --> 00:12:57.399\nwe got them over there as well.\n\n263\n00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:00.873\n&gt;&gt; Mike, would it be also good to know and\nyou might have already mentioned this\n\n264\n00:13:00.873 --> 00:13:03.660\nwhere also know like a scenario\nin which you might use these.\n\n265\n00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.873\nAnd once you start to become a little\nbit familiar with the interface,\n\n266\n00:13:06.873 --> 00:13:09.976\nknow a scenario where they might\nthrow this at you, saying, if x and\n\n267\n00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:13.620\nz are this way, which one of these\nscanners might I use, something like that?\n\n268\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.890\nThe scenario purpose use?\n\n269\n00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.560\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n270\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.270\nAbsolutely.\n\n271\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:20.800\nWhich one will do this or that but again,\nI don't want you to get too focused in on\n\n272\n00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.640\ngetting a list of scanners, and trying to\nmemorize the features of each one of them.\n\n273\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:30.090\nMore about the concept of when you would\nuse a vulnerability scan as part of your\n\n274\n00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.998\nsecurity assessment, as part of your risk\nassessment, as part of a penetration test.\n\n275\n00:13:34.998 --> 00:13:37.973\nWhether that's in-house or\nit's an external company coming in and\n\n276\n00:13:37.973 --> 00:13:41.920\ndoing that for you, that's where you're\ngonna to see these vulnerability scans.\n\n277\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.770\nI mean as I was saying,\nwhile we're waiting for that to finish up,\n\n278\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.150\nOpenVAS is another one that\nyou might be familiar with,\n\n279\n00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.835\nthis will run on Windows and Linux,\nit's actually a fork of Nessus.\n\n280\n00:13:50.835 --> 00:13:55.020\nNessus use to be open source and\nfree many, many years ago.\n\n281\n00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.970\nThey closed it down, went commercial,\nbut OpenVAS was a fork of Nessus.\n\n282\n00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.620\nSo, and it's still available free.\n\n283\n00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.830\nThey did hold off, the development\nkind of paused in OpenVAS for a while.\n\n284\n00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:11.150\nIt's come back and\nthey're starting to do some updates to it.\n\n285\n00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.310\nWhat's some other ones?\n\n286\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.780\nNexpose is one by Rapid7,\nthat actually ties into metasploit.\n\n287\n00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.920\nSo, if you're working with a Kali box,\n\n288\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.720\nyou can use Nexpose to scan the machine,\nfind vulnerabilities.\n\n289\n00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.550\nTie it right into metasploit,\npull up exploits that will\n\n290\n00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.790\ncapitalize on those vulnerabilities,\nand launch an attack from there.\n\n291\n00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:36.520\nAgain, as an pen tester or\nan ethical hacker, not as bad actor.\n\n292\n00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.330\nGFI Languard, Rednum.\n\n293\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.735\nSAINT is another one.\n\n294\n00:14:41.735 --> 00:14:44.640\nThat's a very popular enterprise level.\n\n295\n00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.570\nAnd that's actually one of the few\nthat doesn't run on Windows.\n\n296\n00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.180\nIt only runs in a Linux environment.\n\n297\n00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:55.540\nSo, as I said, many, many out there,\nplay around with a couple just so you kind\n\n298\n00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:01.300\nof get familiar with what the capabilities\nare of a general vulnerability scanner.\n\n299\n00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.270\nDon't expect you to pay a few $1000 for\na license to learn the ins and\n\n300\n00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.473\nouts of say, Saint or Nessus.\n\n301\n00:15:08.473 --> 00:15:11.070\nAll right, this scan is still running.\n\n302\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.120\nSo, I'll tell you what, what we'll do is\nwe'll take a little break and when we come\n\n303\n00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.209\nback, the scan will be finished, and\nwe'll take a look at the results.\n\n304\n00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:21.760\nAll right, so my scan is finished,\nlet's take a look at the results.\n\n305\n00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.230\nGo back to my screen here and we can see\nthe last time that this was completed.\n\n306\n00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.340\nI can always run it again, if I need to.\n\n307\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.346\nThat's another nice thing this is, you\ncan go back in, fix the faults that you\n\n308\n00:15:32.346 --> 00:15:36.904\nfound and then run the scan again and\nmake sure that you fixed them correctly.\n\n309\n00:15:36.904 --> 00:15:40.463\nI'm gonna click on this link,\nbrings me to my report and\n\n310\n00:15:40.463 --> 00:15:43.434\nI can see it's very nice\nlittle report right?\n\n311\n00:15:43.434 --> 00:15:48.253\nNice little color coded bar here,\nI've got medium, low and\n\n312\n00:15:48.253 --> 00:15:53.559\ninfo, also I have a nice graphical or\nlittle ring chart over here.\n\n313\n00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:56.727\nI can see kind of a percentage\nwhich could be helpful, but\n\n314\n00:15:56.727 --> 00:15:58.842\nthen let's get click on one of these.\n\n315\n00:15:58.842 --> 00:16:00.355\nAnd it takes me over to the actuary port.\n\n316\n00:16:00.355 --> 00:16:04.092\nAnd here I can see each one\nof the individual results,\n\n317\n00:16:04.092 --> 00:16:06.400\nthat it found from my scan.\n\n318\n00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:11.010\nSee I have several mediums,\nthat was the 6% or 14% there,\n\n319\n00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:16.760\ngot one that's low and\nthen a bunch of informational type events.\n\n320\n00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.480\nAnd once you click on one of these,\n\n321\n00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.590\nlike lets see\nSSL Certificate Can Not Be Trusted.\n\n322\n00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.230\nSo I'm gonna click on that.\n\n323\n00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:28.090\nAnd it tells me that the servers\nx.509cert is from an unknown\n\n324\n00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.840\npublic certificate authority.\n\n325\n00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.480\nI set it self-signed,\nwhen I use just for this lab.\n\n326\n00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.020\nAnd it tells me my solution, purchasing or\ngenerate a proper certificate, for\n\n327\n00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.950\nthis service.\n\n328\n00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.190\nGives me a couple links to some articles,\nI could go out and\n\n329\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.660\ndo some further reading.\n\n330\n00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.540\nAnd then down at the bottom here,\n\n331\n00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:49.530\nactually shows me some of the output\nfrom the plugin, that found this issue.\n\n332\n00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.820\nAll right, over here you've got\nrisk factor, medium, but again,\n\n333\n00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.490\nthat's kinda spelled out here.\n\n334\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:59.120\nYou also have some of our\nvulnerability database type numbers,\n\n335\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.640\nthat we could look up,\ngood bit of information.\n\n336\n00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:07.350\nWe'll jump back out to that scan,\nand let's try another one.\n\n337\n00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:12.266\nLet's see, DNS Server Cache,\nSnooping Remote Information Disclosure,\n\n338\n00:17:12.266 --> 00:17:13.647\ntelling me that hey,\n\n339\n00:17:13.647 --> 00:17:18.891\nmy server is responding to third parties\nthat don't have the recursion bit set.\n\n340\n00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:20.670\nAgain, probably not a good thing.\n\n341\n00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.210\nIt's warning, me telling me to contact\nthe vendor of the DNS software for a fix.\n\n342\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.191\nSo maybe I need to,\nI'm running Microsoft's DNS,\n\n343\n00:17:27.191 --> 00:17:29.570\nneed to look at the DNS and find it.\n\n344\n00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.680\nThere's actually a patch for\nthis one, or maybe it's not this one,\n\n345\n00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.720\nthis is just a configuration.\n\n346\n00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.030\nAnd the results, you know,\nhow it came to that conclusion.\n\n347\n00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.800\nTells me that it sent\na non-recursive query.\n\n348\n00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.880\nAnd received an answer,\n\n349\n00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.910\nwhich it's saying it probably shouldn't\nhave received an answer, right?\n\n350\n00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.420\nSo, and again, we're not here to learn\nabout any particular vulnerability.\n\n351\n00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.905\nI'm not trying to point these out,\nbecause they're common ones, or\n\n352\n00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.390\nones you should worry about.\n\n353\n00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:57.450\nI just wanna show you how these\nvulnerability scanners work.\n\n354\n00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:02.200\nAnd what you should see is that,\nyou know, basic, they're the same.\n\n355\n00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:07.064\nWhat we did with MBSA, versus what we did\nwith NESSUS, is we gave it an IP address,\n\n356\n00:18:07.064 --> 00:18:08.905\nwe let it go out, do its thing.\n\n357\n00:18:08.905 --> 00:18:12.553\nWe get a report back in the end,\nthat gives us this information, and\n\n358\n00:18:12.553 --> 00:18:16.030\nnow we have to analyze it and\ntry to make sense of it.\n\n359\n00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.540\nThe differences though you\nsaw between MBSA, NICE,\n\n360\n00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:24.294\nfree Microsoft only, versus something like\nNESSUS, where it's an enterprise solution.\n\n361\n00:18:24.294 --> 00:18:26.400\nAnd people are writing plugins, and\n\n362\n00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.070\nthis thing will tie in with\nreporting capabilities.\n\n363\n00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.108\nIt's a much more powerful solution.\n\n364\n00:18:32.108 --> 00:18:35.676\nYou saw that we could tie\nin PCI compliance, or\n\n365\n00:18:35.676 --> 00:18:39.770\nother regulatory boards\nthat we have to follow.\n\n366\n00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:43.535\nAnd we can get plug-ins, or write our own\nplug-ins, to look for that kind of thing.\n\n367\n00:18:43.535 --> 00:18:46.990\nAnd if we need to stay in compliance, and\nwe need to prove our compliance, right,\n\n368\n00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.695\nthese are the kind of things that we do.\n\n369\n00:18:48.695 --> 00:18:52.330\nWe've run tools like this, we get these\nreports, and then when they come in and\n\n370\n00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.410\nthen do their audit, we have information\nbacking up our statement that yes,\n\n371\n00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.760\nwe are in compliance.\n\n372\n00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.730\nAnd typically they don't take my word for\nit.\n\n373\n00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:00.737\nI don't know why.\n\n374\n00:19:00.737 --> 00:19:03.591\nI have to show them proof,\nthat we are in compliance, and\n\n375\n00:19:03.591 --> 00:19:06.500\nthis is one of the ways we\nwould end up doing that.\n\n376\n00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.610\nSo NESSUS, very powerful one.\n\n377\n00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.780\nAs I said towards the beginning or\nthe middle of this episode,\n\n378\n00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.840\nI kind of lost track, go out there and\nplay with a few different ones.\n\n379\n00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.860\nJust familiarize yourself with the basic\ncapabilities, of vulnerability scanners.\n\n380\n00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:24.240\nTry scanning individual machines,\nscan a Linux box versus a Windows box.\n\n381\n00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.170\nTry to do a network based scan.\n\n382\n00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:30.350\nSee if it does, just kind of test\nthe capabilities of the different ones.\n\n383\n00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.550\nBut don't spend any too much\ntime on one particular one.\n\n384\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:38.410\nIt's gonna be a more general\nunderstanding, of vulnerability scanners.\n\n385\n00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:38.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike.\n\n386\n00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.670\nWell, that's a lot of great\ninformation on vulnerability scanning.\n\n387\n00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.262\nAnd thank you for taking the time,\nto not only show us the product,\n\n388\n00:19:44.262 --> 00:19:47.318\na couple of the products, but actually\ninterpret what we're seeing here, so\n\n389\n00:19:47.318 --> 00:19:48.597\nwe can make some sense out of it.\n\n390\n00:19:48.597 --> 00:19:50.229\nNow, I am looking at the clock, and\n\n391\n00:19:50.229 --> 00:19:53.290\nit does look like we are coming to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n392\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.850\nBut before we do, do you have any parting\nwords that you might like to tell our\n\n393\n00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:57.490\naudience, when it comes to\nvulnerability scanning?\n\n394\n00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.075\n&gt;&gt; You know there's always something\nI forget to talk about, right?\n\n395\n00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:02.411\nNow, not really.\n\n396\n00:20:02.411 --> 00:20:04.115\nI don't know if I mentioned the fact,\n\n397\n00:20:04.115 --> 00:20:06.180\nlet's take a look at my\nscreen one more time.\n\n398\n00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.270\nJust to show, with those scans,\nI told you I could rerun this scan.\n\n399\n00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.216\nIt keeps all of your scans,\nyou can put them in folders.\n\n400\n00:20:13.216 --> 00:20:18.346\nThis kinda particular, this one, but a lot\nof do this, have the same capability.\n\n401\n00:20:18.346 --> 00:20:22.870\nTo where I can organize my scan results,\nand keep them from, again,\n\n402\n00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.700\nreporting services for\ngoing back and doing comparison.\n\n403\n00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.095\nAnd you can kill the screen share,\nI'm not gonna share that anymore.\n\n404\n00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:32.747\nBut yeah, the main thing I wanna point out\nis, this is not something you do once, and\n\n405\n00:20:32.747 --> 00:20:33.738\nthen forget about it.\n\n406\n00:20:33.738 --> 00:20:36.978\nYou know, save these scans,\nrun these scans in the future, and\n\n407\n00:20:36.978 --> 00:20:38.790\nthen do a delta between them.\n\n408\n00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.230\nWhat's changed?\n\n409\n00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.090\nWhy is it changed?\n\n410\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.350\nIs this service new?\n\n411\n00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.220\nIs this a misconfiguration?\n\n412\n00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.650\nThose are the kinda things you can get,\nby doing vulnerability scans, and\n\n413\n00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:52.500\nthen comparing them and\ndoing them frequently.\n\n414\n00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.910\n&gt;&gt; All right, great information, Mike.\n\n415\n00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.120\nWealth of knowledge, as always.\n\n416\n00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.580\nThanks for being in the studio with us.\n\n417\n00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.570\nAnd thank you, to you the viewer watching.\n\n418\n00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.320\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n419\n00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.080\n&gt;&gt; I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n420\n00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.293\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see

00:00:11.769\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.322\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITPro TV, I'm your host,\n\n5\n00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:15.877\nWes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:18.040\nAnd what are we coming\nback at you with today?\n\n7\n00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.655\nAbout more of that CompTia Cybersecurity\nAnalyst+, thank you for joining us.\n\n8\n00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:22.825\nAnd speaking of joining us,\n\n9\n00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:25.718\nback at the studios today with us is\nnone other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:25.718 --> 00:00:26.840\nHow are you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.640\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.220\nThanks for having me back,\nexcited to be here as always.\n\n13\n00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.930\nSo, today we're gonna continue on, we've\nbeen talking a lot about vulnerabilities.\n\n14\n00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.110\nAnd one of the topics for this exam is to\nthink about and be able to, Recognize or\n\n15\n00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.027\nunderstand different vulnerabilities,\nthe different components on your\n\n16\n00:00:47.027 --> 00:00:51.570\nnetwork face like servers, end points,\nnetwork infrastructure, things like that.\n\n17\n00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.050\nSo that's what we want to go over.\n\n18\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.120\nAnd I kinda wanted to throw in with\nthis some real world examples, some of\n\n19\n00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.480\nthe breaches that have happened at least\nhere in the US over the last few years, so\n\n20\n00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.720\nwe can get an idea of why this is so\nimportant.\n\n21\n00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.223\nWhy doing vulnerability assessments?\n\n22\n00:01:07.223 --> 00:01:08.312\nWhy we spend so much time on it?\n\n23\n00:01:08.312 --> 00:01:12.210\nWhy we want to make sure that we have\na good understanding of its importance?\n\n24\n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.380\nWhy we do it periodically?\n\n25\n00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.220\nAnd by showing you some of\nthese real world examples,\n\n26\n00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.200\nI think that will help all of\nthis sink in as well as realize,\n\n27\n00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.420\nwow dangerous, scary and\nit can be expensive if you don't.\n\n28\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.460\nSo we'll go over a few of those.\n\n29\n00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.140\nAnd we'll just start\nwith the one that I know\n\n30\n00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.380\nmost of us have heard about unless\nyou're under a rock somewhere,\n\n31\n00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.130\nat least here in the United States,\nis the Target breach.\n\n32\n00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.990\nTarget had a data breach back in,\nI can check my notes, 2013 December.\n\n33\n00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.730\nAnd at that point, as of December 2013,\nthis was the largest breach ever reported.\n\n34\n00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.733\nMake sure we throw that little\nclause in there, right?\n\n35\n00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.420\nThere might have been others\nthat weren't actually reported.\n\n36\n00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.570\nBut this was the largest\nbreach ever reported.\n\n37\n00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.010\nAnd how they got in?\n\n38\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.850\nThere is some great\nwhite papers out there.\n\n39\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.109\nIf you've ever been to SANS reading room,\n\n40\n00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.699\nI'll show you a peek of\nthat in just a little bit.\n\n41\n00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:05.527\nYou can get some white papers on\na lot of these different attacks,\n\n42\n00:02:05.527 --> 00:02:06.770\nwhere they do case studies.\n\n43\n00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.476\nThey go back and look at what happened,\nwhat could have been done to prevent it.\n\n44\n00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:11.880\nReally great information.\n\n45\n00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.640\nDefinitely worth looking up and\ntaking a peruse of.\n\n46\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.290\nBut they had malware installed\non their systems at the,\n\n47\n00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.460\nwell, say, theirs was at the point\nof sale systems in their network.\n\n48\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.910\nBut they had a, what was it?\n\n49\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.056\nThey had third party vendor\ncredentials were compromised and so\n\n50\n00:02:29.056 --> 00:02:33.599\nthis was, people, I wanna say was HVAC,\nbut don't quote me on that.\n\n51\n00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.020\nBut these were people that had access\nto the network, to provide services.\n\n52\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.300\nThey were compromised, or\nthat was the way into the system.\n\n53\n00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.160\nAnd they ended up getting this malware\ninstalled on these point of sale systems,\n\n54\n00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.520\nwhere they can just do grab\ncredit card information.\n\n55\n00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.070\nAnd the way that you end up\ndoing this a lot of times,\n\n56\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.550\nand I don't know if this\ncase worked this exact way.\n\n57\n00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.710\nBut the user malware that does what they\ncall memory scraping or RAM scraping.\n\n58\n00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.850\nAnd as these POS systems\nprocess this card information,\n\n59\n00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.420\nthey load them up into memory.\n\n60\n00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.361\nAnd that's in plain text and\nthey can scrape the memory,\n\n61\n00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:10.284\nretrieve that information, and\nsend it back to the attacker's servers for\n\n62\n00:03:10.284 --> 00:03:12.504\ncataloging, to start catching these up.\n\n63\n00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:18.620\nAnd they had 40 million payment cards,\ndebit cards, credit cards, stolen.\n\n64\n00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.520\nEnded up being, for them, they did a $10\nmillion settlement to try to repay\n\n65\n00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.710\nsome of the users that were compromised,\nthe information that was compromised.\n\n66\n00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.582\nAnd that's just what they did in the\nsettlement, that's not what they ended up\n\n67\n00:03:32.582 --> 00:03:39.195\npaying in and cost to fix their network,\nand cost as far as reputation goes.\n\n68\n00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:42.299\nI wanna say that quarter\ntheir sales were down 43%,\n\n69\n00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.675\nthe quarter after this\nbreach was reported.\n\n70\n00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:47.524\nSo you can imagine, I mean,\nthat's a big chunk of revenue.\n\n71\n00:03:47.524 --> 00:03:51.946\nIf your company all of a sudden\nhad 50% less profit for\n\n72\n00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:55.175\na quarter, could you even survive?\n\n73\n00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:57.720\nAnd Target did but it's a lot of dough.\n\n74\n00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.940\nAnother big one was Sony.\n\n75\n00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.460\nSony Pictures was compromised, and\n\n76\n00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.020\nthis they believe, was actually\na state sponsored hacking event.\n\n77\n00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.140\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation here\nin the US claims it was North Korea.\n\n78\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.210\nNorth Korea obviously denies this,\n\n79\n00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.440\nis not admitting to it,\nthey say they didn't do it.\n\n80\n00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.410\nDon't know that we'll ever know for sure,\nbut Sony Pictures was attacked, and\n\n81\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.550\nthey lost all kinds of information.\n\n82\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.860\nThey had projects that they\nwere working on, big movies.\n\n83\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.220\nAt the time, they were getting ready to,\nI don't know if you remember this.\n\n84\n00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.042\nThere was a movie coming\nout called The Interview.\n\n85\n00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:37.998\nIf I remember the plot of the story,\n\n86\n00:04:37.998 --> 00:04:42.303\na couple of guys were gonna be going over\nto North Korea, and the CIA talked them\n\n87\n00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:47.190\ninto using that mission as a plot to\nassassinate the president of North Korea.\n\n88\n00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.120\nAnd obviously, I think there was some\nimplications there, maybe or maybe not.\n\n89\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.968\nAgain, who knows who\nactually did the breach?\n\n90\n00:04:53.968 --> 00:04:59.350\n[COUGH] But anyway, they lost all kinds\nof information about all their employees,\n\n91\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.150\nactors, salaries, movies, budgets.\n\n92\n00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.710\nOne of the higher ups in Sony ended\nup resigning because a lot of their\n\n93\n00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.394\nemails were leaked out.\n\n94\n00:05:08.394 --> 00:05:11.453\nAnd some of those emails were\nnot that politically correct, so\n\n95\n00:05:11.453 --> 00:05:14.234\nthere were some issues there and\nshe ended up resigning.\n\n96\n00:05:14.234 --> 00:05:17.530\nSo it just caused a tremendous\namount of damage.\n\n97\n00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.570\nThey estimate that they wiped out over,\n\n98\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.550\nI forget how many terabytes\nthey said of data.\n\n99\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.375\nJust wiped the servers clean.\n\n100\n00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:28.151\nCuz at first, they went in and\nbreached and stole information.\n\n101\n00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:31.052\nAnd then not long after that,\nthey actually went back in and\n\n102\n00:05:31.052 --> 00:05:32.795\nstarted wiping their servers, and\n\n103\n00:05:32.795 --> 00:05:36.990\nthen posting a lot of the stolen data\nout online and making that available.\n\n104\n00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:44.380\nAnd then, not too long after that,\nI think it was, Yahoo was another big one.\n\n105\n00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.038\nYahoo was compromised, actually attacks\nthat were occurring back in 2013,\n\n106\n00:05:50.038 --> 00:05:53.734\n2014, and then again in 2015 and 2016.\n\n107\n00:05:53.734 --> 00:05:55.750\nHave you canceled your Yahoo account yet?\n\n108\n00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.010\n&gt;&gt; No, not yet.\n&gt;&gt; I'm kidding, Yahoo.\n\n109\n00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.687\nHopefully, you have this straightened out.\n\n110\n00:05:58.687 --> 00:06:04.050\nBut 500 million users\ninformation compromised, right?\n\n111\n00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.260\nThey don't know if it was\nstate sponsored or not.\n\n112\n00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.450\nThen that was in the one in 2014.\n\n113\n00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:16.714\nIn 2013, 1 billion users, almost their\nentire user database was compromised.\n\n114\n00:06:16.714 --> 00:06:18.750\nWhat else was I gonna say about that?\n\n115\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.625\nEnded up costing them,Yahoo!,\nis trying to be sold to Verizon,\n\n116\n00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:24.992\nor Verizon was attempting to buy Yahoo!\n\n117\n00:06:24.992 --> 00:06:31.170\nAnd they ended up knocking $350 million\noff of the price due to these attacks.\n\n118\n00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.802\nYahoo!, is also under investigation\nby the SEC because of the delay.\n\n119\n00:06:35.802 --> 00:06:39.254\nThey didn't report some of\nthese attacks until 2016.\n\n120\n00:06:39.254 --> 00:06:42.640\nWe're talking about years\nafter the events occurred.\n\n121\n00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:48.035\nThey have 23 punitive\nclass action lawsuits.\n\n122\n00:06:48.035 --> 00:06:51.755\nThey waited, again,\na long time to notify breach victims.\n\n123\n00:06:51.755 --> 00:06:54.955\nThey didn't give any information\nto the SEC about the breach.\n\n124\n00:06:54.955 --> 00:06:58.171\nSo they were in big trouble for that.\n\n125\n00:06:58.171 --> 00:06:58.724\nScary, scary stuff.\n\n126\n00:06:58.724 --> 00:07:03.985\nAnd then, 2014, Home Depot turns around,\nthey've got a big data breach.\n\n127\n00:07:03.985 --> 00:07:07.630\nThey had, remember Target was one\nof the largest ones, at 40 million?\n\n128\n00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.120\nUntil Home Depot comes along and\nsays, hey,\n\n129\n00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.770\nwe just lost 56 million user's\npayment card information.\n\n130\n00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.780\nThey had some custom-built malware\nthat was introduced into their system.\n\n131\n00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.360\nAgain, they're pretty sure\nit was a third-party vendor\n\n132\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.440\nthat put this custom malware\non their POS systems.\n\n133\n00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.840\nWas able to steal or\nexfiltrate the data that way.\n\n134\n00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.286\nSo it ended up costing Home Depot\nsomewhere around $62 million,\n\n135\n00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:36.590\nonce it was all set and done.\n\n136\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.901\nAnd then the other one I wanna\nmention was the Memorial Healthcare.\n\n137\n00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:43.880\nWe had talked about HIPAA the other day\nin one of our previous episodes, and\n\n138\n00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.105\nthe fines associated with that.\n\n139\n00:07:46.105 --> 00:07:51.939\nMemorial Healthcare Systems ended\nup paying a $5.5 million settlement\n\n140\n00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:56.872\nto HIPAA or whomever collects that money,\nI guess it's HIPAA.\n\n141\n00:07:56.872 --> 00:07:59.463\n$5.5 million for their breaches.\n\n142\n00:07:59.463 --> 00:08:00.543\nThey had internal users.\n\n143\n00:08:00.543 --> 00:08:04.590\nAnd users working out of affiliated\nphysicians offices that had access to\n\n144\n00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:09.800\npersonal information and they were taking\nthat information and selling it out there.\n\n145\n00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.192\nOver 100,000 individuals,\nthere was a former employee,\n\n146\n00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:16.650\nsomebody that didn't even work there,\ntheir credentials were being used for\n\n147\n00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.160\nover a year after the employee\nwas terminated, right?\n\n148\n00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.530\nThink about that, and\nhow easy that would've been to prevent.\n\n149\n00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.840\nHey, we should have a policy in place\nwhen we get rid of an employee,\n\n150\n00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.080\nan employee leaves our organization,\nlet's make sure we disable their account.\n\n151\n00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.600\nI mean,\nthat's pretty much a no-brainer right?\n\n152\n00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.810\nI know, probably everybody out\nthere's thinking, yeah, duh,\n\n153\n00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:37.970\nwe learned that in Security 101.\n\n154\n00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.550\nThat should be the first thing you do,\nthey didn't do it.\n\n155\n00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.750\nAnd so ended up costing them\na huge amount of money.\n\n156\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.568\nAnd partly because [COUGH] excuse me,\nnot just because of the data breach and\n\n157\n00:08:48.568 --> 00:08:52.790\nthe lost records and information cuz\nthere's big fines associated with that.\n\n158\n00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.970\nAlso because of the fact that they knew\nabout the weaknesses in their system,\n\n159\n00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.490\nfrom previous audits before\nthe attack did nothing to correct it.\n\n160\n00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.890\nAnd the corrections would have been\nsimple to implement and imply and\n\n161\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.030\nthey chose not to do it for\none reason or another.\n\n162\n00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.490\nAnd so because of that,\nHIPAA ups the fines.\n\n163\n00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.760\nThey say, look, this was very,\nvery easily preventable.\n\n164\n00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.440\nYou knew about it and you chose not to\ndo about it, now the onus is on you or\n\n165\n00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.000\nthe liability is on you.\n\n166\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.830\n&gt;&gt; One of the things I'm starting to see\nhere listening to all these different\n\n167\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.600\nexamples, Mike, is that we talk\nabout common vulnerabilities,\n\n168\n00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.110\nwe talk about vulnerability assessment,\nvulnerability scanning.\n\n169\n00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.920\nIt's starting to look that it's very\nimportant even if you're talking about\n\n170\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.320\njust a simplistic vulnerability can\nlead to some massive consequences.\n\n171\n00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.100\nI know you and I have talked in\nthe past about this also happening to\n\n172\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.900\nanother company that provided external\ncertificates and they did the same thing.\n\n173\n00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.750\nThey kinda tried to brush it under\nthe carpet that they had been breached and\n\n174\n00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.110\nthat a massive breach that had happened.\n\n175\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.390\nAnd when the public found out about it,\nfound that they tried to\n\n176\n00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.210\nsweep it under the carpet there,\nthey're no longer in business.\n\n177\n00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.110\nSo, Mike, what I'm getting is that,\nwhen it comes to the vulnerability, it\n\n178\n00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.710\ndoesn't matter how small the vulnerability\nis to how massive the vulnerability is.\n\n179\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.790\nAny one of these vulnerabilities can come\nand cost a company millions of dollars.\n\n180\n00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.130\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and\nto me the biggest thing I see here is\n\n181\n00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.290\nwe're not learning from our mistakes,\nright?\n\n182\n00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.690\nI talked about the other day the fact\nthat big data's the thing but\n\n183\n00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.780\nnow it's almost more about what you do\nwith the data, not just what you know but\n\n184\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.380\nwhat can you with what you know.\n\n185\n00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.050\nAnd being able to share, we talked some\nof those frameworks that governmental\n\n186\n00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.750\norganizations or people putting together,\nTaxi and sticks for\n\n187\n00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:36.940\nexample, of being able to share breach\ninformation with other organizations and\n\n188\n00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.425\nwith the government to help make\nsure that we can protect ourselves.\n\n189\n00:10:41.425 --> 00:10:42.795\nLearn from those mistakes.\n\n190\n00:10:42.795 --> 00:10:44.469\nAnd you take Home Depot, for example.\n\n191\n00:10:44.469 --> 00:10:49.863\nAnd Target was breached a year before with\nalmost the same technique, all right?\n\n192\n00:10:49.863 --> 00:10:54.733\nAnd it's easy to look, you know,\nhindsight's 20/20, right,\n\n193\n00:10:54.733 --> 00:10:58.304\nso I'm not saying that I\nwould've done any better,\n\n194\n00:10:58.304 --> 00:11:02.257\nhopefully I would have but\nI'm not saying I would have.\n\n195\n00:11:02.257 --> 00:11:04.907\nBut you would think that we\nwould learn from these mistakes.\n\n196\n00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:12.000\nTheir biggest problem was they weren't\nmonitoring vendor credentials properly,\n\n197\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.450\nwhich means the vendors are able to access\ntheir system and potentially access parts\n\n198\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.190\nof their systems that the vendors\nhad no need to access, right?\n\n199\n00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.040\nWe want to make sure that we've got to\ngive vendors access to our network,\n\n200\n00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.340\nwe restrict what they can get to.\n\n201\n00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.029\nThey just need to be able to get in and\nmonitor HVAC systems, or if they work\n\n202\n00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:31.787\nunder a point of sales systems, that's\nwhat they need to be able to get to.\n\n203\n00:11:31.787 --> 00:11:35.085\nNot the rest of the network, right,\nnot the rest of the corporate data.\n\n204\n00:11:35.085 --> 00:11:39.224\nThe POS network, POS, I don't think\nI defined that, point of sale,\n\n205\n00:11:39.224 --> 00:11:43.170\nwhen you go and you swipe your cards\nin those little devices there.\n\n206\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.795\nYour point of sale devices or POSs,\nthe POS network was not segregated, right,\n\n207\n00:11:47.795 --> 00:11:49.980\nit was part of the corporate network.\n\n208\n00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.780\nSo if I compromise that POS system,\nI can now pivot from that right into\n\n209\n00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.610\nthe corporate network and start gaining\naccess to all kinds of information.\n\n210\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.940\nSimple VLAN segregation for\nthe POS system would have prevented it.\n\n211\n00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.230\nYeah, and again, hindsight's 20/20, it's\neasy for me to come out here and say that.\n\n212\n00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.380\nBut I wanna make sure that we\nlearn from these mistakes.\n\n213\n00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.040\nAnd as an organization,\n\n214\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.170\nas an IT security professional, these\nare the kinds we've gotta think about.\n\n215\n00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:18.490\nWe've gotta go out and do our research and\nlook at these past attacks and\n\n216\n00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.618\nlearn from them so that we can better\nimplement security in our networks.\n\n217\n00:12:22.618 --> 00:12:25.830\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it's easy to play Monday\nmorning, what is it they call it?\n\n218\n00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:26.856\nMonday morning quarterback?\n\n219\n00:12:26.856 --> 00:12:28.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what you should have done.\n\n220\n00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.330\nMike, would you classify that under\na concept that I know we're gonna\n\n221\n00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.240\nlearn in another episode\nlike lessons learned.\n\n222\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.550\nI mean, it's important to take that\ninformation, audit that information, and\n\n223\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.010\nthen hopefully, like you said over and\nover, that we can learn from it and\n\n224\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.140\nthat we can move on from there.\n\n225\n00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.430\nAnd hopefully,\nmaybe stop that vulnerability.\n\n226\n00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.640\nNot only for ourselves, but\n\n227\n00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.620\nmaybe even other people in the future\nthat might have that same situation.\n\n228\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.480\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n229\n00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.270\nThat's why we looked at looking\nat RSS feeds the other day, and\n\n230\n00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.090\nhow do you stay on top of the current\nevents when it comes to these breaches and\n\n231\n00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.980\nvulnerabilities that are being discovered?\n\n232\n00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.000\nCuz they're being discovered\non a daily basis.\n\n233\n00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.837\nThis is why it's important.\n\n234\n00:13:00.837 --> 00:13:04.155\nYou go through your reader every morning,\nand\n\n235\n00:13:04.155 --> 00:13:08.760\nyou see a vulnerability for\nweb cam so and so, model 3-13 A.\n\n236\n00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.940\nYou're like wait,\ndon't we have those here in-house?\n\n237\n00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.130\nLet me do a little more research and\n\n238\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.730\nfind out what's going on and take care\nof that before you get breached, right?\n\n239\n00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.770\nBefore you find out about\nthat vulnerability.\n\n240\n00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI've heard somebody tell me before.\n\n241\n00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:26.020\nI'm not sure exactly who told\nme about that, what is it?\n\n242\n00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.464\nIt is communication,\neducation leads to awareness, and\n\n243\n00:13:29.464 --> 00:13:33.346\nthat's a triad that has to keep on\ngoing on over and over and over.\n\n244\n00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:35.169\nNow Mike, let's say that, theoretically,\n\n245\n00:13:35.169 --> 00:13:37.568\nI've rolled out the diagram\nof my infrastructure, right?\n\n246\n00:13:37.568 --> 00:13:41.165\nAnd I've got components in place, and they\nall have their roles and their purposes.\n\n247\n00:13:41.165 --> 00:13:43.047\nWhat are some of the devices or\n\n248\n00:13:43.047 --> 00:13:46.625\nsome of the locations where\nI need to maybe focus on?\n\n249\n00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:47.471\n&gt;&gt; The entire network.\n\n250\n00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:49.799\nI mean, everything, everything on that\npicture you should really focus on.\n\n251\n00:13:49.799 --> 00:13:51.224\nNow, maybe not the media.\n\n252\n00:13:51.224 --> 00:13:55.705\nNo, actually the media too because I can\ntap into the media and you don't know.\n\n253\n00:13:55.705 --> 00:14:00.335\nHonestly though, for this exam we do\nwanna point out a few or we wanna discuss\n\n254\n00:14:00.335 --> 00:14:03.125\ncommon vulnerabilities that occur\nat certain points in our network,\n\n255\n00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:05.648\nI guess is a good way to say it.\n\n256\n00:14:05.648 --> 00:14:08.010\nYou know, like when we looked\nat those previous attacks,\n\n257\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:14.060\nwe saw POS systems being a primary entry\npoint for a lot of these data breaches.\n\n258\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.530\nThey're always gonna find the weakest link\nin your system and use that to get in.\n\n259\n00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.600\nAnd it might not always be your systems.\n\n260\n00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.870\nIt could be, you've got a business partner\nthat you have an extranet set up with.\n\n261\n00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:29.300\nAnd that partner is not secure as you are,\nas they should be.\n\n262\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:34.160\nTheir network gets compromised, and then\nthat's their doorway into your network,\n\n263\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.050\ncuz their network has a VPN back to you,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n264\n00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.300\nSo we've gotta look at every\nsingle aspect of our network.\n\n265\n00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.620\nWe call that the attack surface,\nand we're always trying to reduce\n\n266\n00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.700\nour attack surface,\nall the points that are coming in.\n\n267\n00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.360\nAnd any place that we can't reduce it or\neliminate it, we need to strengthen it and\n\n268\n00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.370\nmake sure that we're at least\nmonitoring it if nothing else so\n\n269\n00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:56.820\nthat we'll notice what's going on.\n\n270\n00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.110\nCuz some of these attacks that took\nplace over several months, and\n\n271\n00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:05.210\nwe're gonna talk about in\na previous episode in the future.\n\n272\n00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.100\nBecause we've got a time\nmachine here at ITProTV.\n\n273\n00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.010\nIn a future episode or\nin one of these other episodes,\n\n274\n00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.170\nwe're gonna talk about something\ncalled an advanced persistent threat.\n\n275\n00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.380\nAnd this is what we're seeing\na lot of today in these attacks.\n\n276\n00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.000\nPeople are getting into the network and\nit's no longer smash and grab.\n\n277\n00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.710\nWhere I break in, I grab as much data as\nI can, I get out and I try to sell it.\n\n278\n00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:30.690\nI want to get in, not set off any alarms,\nset up a back door and\n\n279\n00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.990\nstay in there and slowly filter out data.\n\n280\n00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.430\nSee what all the kind of good stuff we\ncan find and stay in that network for\n\n281\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.600\nmonths without being detected.\n\n282\n00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.690\nThose are the really scary ones.\n\n283\n00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.020\nA lot of these compromises\nthat I'm talking about,\n\n284\n00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:47.090\nyou find out that this is\nwhen the breach was reported.\n\n285\n00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.080\nBut when we look at the breach itself,\nit occurred eight months ago, right?\n\n286\n00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.455\nThat's when they actually\nbroke into the system.\n\n287\n00:15:52.455 --> 00:15:55.290\nThey're just now figuring out\nthat they've been compromised.\n\n288\n00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.502\nScary, scary stuff, and\nThat data ends up going out there.\n\n289\n00:15:59.502 --> 00:16:02.243\nI guess we can,\nwe'll continue on some of these examples.\n\n290\n00:16:02.243 --> 00:16:05.440\nI like talking about this stuff,\nI don't know about you guys.\n\n291\n00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.070\nIt is really scary when you look at\nwhat the bad actors are doing nowadays.\n\n292\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.880\nThey're scaling up, they're scaling out,\nthey're going to the cloud.\n\n293\n00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:18.660\nYou can now hire people,\nthey have ransomware as a service.\n\n294\n00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.970\nYou can go and you can hire people\nto write custom ransomware for you.\n\n295\n00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.170\nThat says where to send the money,\n\n296\n00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.140\nthey get a percentage of the money you\ncollect from the ransomware, all right.\n\n297\n00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.670\nWhen they steal credit card information\nlike this, they will, what happens is that\n\n298\n00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.700\nwhy are they stealing,\nhow do you monetize this as a bad guy?\n\n299\n00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.050\nAnd what they end up doing is\nthere's brokers out there.\n\n300\n00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.920\nIf I go and steal a million credit\ncard numbers from Home Depot or\n\n301\n00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.480\nsomebody, I'm gonna find\na broker that deals with this and\n\n302\n00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.130\nI'm gonna sell them to\nthat person en mass.\n\n303\n00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.090\nAnd then they're going to take\nthem out to the dark net or\n\n304\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.720\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n305\n00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.820\nThere's sites out there,\n\n306\n00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.840\nI had a screenshot I should've kept\nthat I don't think I have it anymore,\n\n307\n00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.830\nof a website where you can pick a what\ncredit card are you looking for,\n\n308\n00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.510\nwhat bank is it associated with,\nyou want American Express/Visa.\n\n309\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:05.040\nAnd it's basically a shopping cart for\nstolen credit cards.\n\n310\n00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.070\nAnd then what you do,\nthey get the stolen credit card.\n\n311\n00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:10.540\nThey use the stolen credit card\nto buy a prepaid credit card,\n\n312\n00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.310\nthen they'll take the prepaid credit\ncard and go and buy a gift card for\n\n313\n00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:20.100\nBest Buy or Amazon, and then they'll use\nthat gift card to purchase products.\n\n314\n00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.320\nAnd then they'll turn around and\nsell those products online.\n\n315\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.150\nAnd by the time the breach has occurred,\nI mean,\n\n316\n00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:29.080\nyou're never gonna be able to trace\nthat all the back to that person.\n\n317\n00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.420\nSo that's how they're\nmonetizing that information.\n\n318\n00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.089\nIt's not they're taking your credit card\nand then using it at different stores.\n\n319\n00:17:34.089 --> 00:17:35.588\nIt's not like in the old days.\n\n320\n00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:38.971\nI say the old days, a few years ago,\nwhere if your information was stolen,\n\n321\n00:17:38.971 --> 00:17:42.626\nthey were doing identity theft, and just\ngetting a credit card in your name, and\n\n322\n00:17:42.626 --> 00:17:43.945\ngoing shopping.\n\n323\n00:17:43.945 --> 00:17:45.365\nThey've become very smart.\n\n324\n00:17:45.365 --> 00:17:47.690\nAnd they've figured out\nhow to monetize it.\n\n325\n00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.930\nAnd yet minimized the risk\nassociated with that, all right?\n\n326\n00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.780\nBecause they don't want to get caught,\nthey don't want to go to jail.\n\n327\n00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.000\nSo, they do everything they can.\n\n328\n00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.610\nThey do their risk assessment\njust like we do and\n\n329\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.220\nthey figure out ways to\nmonetized this stuff.\n\n330\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.890\nSo, again in the end I'm not gonna get you\ndetails of these breaches on the exam.\n\n331\n00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.110\nBut I thought it was important since\nwe're spending so much time here talking\n\n332\n00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:11.180\nabout vulnerabilities and why we should\nwe be doing these vulnerability scans.\n\n333\n00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.860\nIf Target, if Home Depot,\nif any of these people had been doing\n\n334\n00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.220\ngood vulnerability assessments, and then\nacting on those, like we saw, what was it?\n\n335\n00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.940\nMemorial Healthcare Systems,\n\n336\n00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.650\nthey did vulnerability scans,\nfailed to act on the results, right?\n\n337\n00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:28.190\nDidn't interpret the results correctly,\nor failed to act on them altogether.\n\n338\n00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.460\nEnded up costing them.\n\n339\n00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.360\nSo it should underline how important\ndoing these vulnerability scans and\n\n340\n00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.520\nunderstanding and\ninterpreting that data can be.\n\n341\n00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.040\nNow back to, in fact, to what we\nwere talking about Wes there with\n\n342\n00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.850\nthe network and\nwhere are my attack vectors?\n\n343\n00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.210\nAs I said, they're everywhere,\nto use a line from Halo.\n\n344\n00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.950\nThey're everywhere but\nservers are a prime target.\n\n345\n00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.060\nWhen we talk about servers,\nwell what's a server, right?\n\n346\n00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.770\nA server is running a server\noperating system, Lenox, Windows,\n\n347\n00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.870\nwhatever it may be, but they're designed\nto provide services to the network.\n\n348\n00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:06.262\nSo that means, they already have built\nin entry ways to provide some service.\n\n349\n00:19:06.262 --> 00:19:08.400\nWhether that's a web server,\na file server,\n\n350\n00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.910\na print server, whatever the case may be.\n\n351\n00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.360\nSo it has vulnerable,\nI shouldn't say vulnerabilities,\n\n352\n00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.320\nbut there are definitely ways in.\n\n353\n00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.390\nWe can't just line it with concrete,\nit's gotta provide a service.\n\n354\n00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.510\nA lot of these servers are public facing.\n\n355\n00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.400\nI've got a website, it's not just for\n\n356\n00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.460\nmy internal employees,\nI have a website where we do ecommerce.\n\n357\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.720\nI want people to be able to come\nto my site and buy my product.\n\n358\n00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.950\nThat means it has to be\nexposed to the Internet.\n\n359\n00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.160\nThat a scary place out there\nwith all the bad guys.\n\n360\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.310\nThose are the kind of things\nthat we've gotta look at.\n\n361\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:45.200\nSo when you talk about your servers,\nthey're public facing which exposes them.\n\n362\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.830\nwe've gotta make sure\nwe're protecting them.\n\n363\n00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.410\nWe've gotta monitor them.\n\n364\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.630\nWe can use intrusion detection,\nintrusion prevention systems, firewalls.\n\n365\n00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.885\nNot only network based firewalls,\n\n366\n00:19:54.885 --> 00:19:59.380\npost-based firewalls, reading log files,\nlooking at log files.\n\n367\n00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.630\nA lot of these attacks we talked about,\nthere were entries in the log file.\n\n368\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.610\nThis is how we find out\nabout the attack afterward.\n\n369\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.030\nYou go back and read the log files and\nyou can see what happened.\n\n370\n00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.950\nWow, wonder if I would have read those\nlog files like a month into the attack.\n\n371\n00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.640\nIf maybe we could've saved\nourselves some money, and\n\n372\n00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.509\nonly released 4,000 credit cards\ninstead of 40 million credit cards.\n\n373\n00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:19.400\nThose are the kind of things\nwe gotta think about.\n\n374\n00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.096\nAgain, hindsight, 20/20.\n\n375\n00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:22.928\nDoS, denial of service,\n\n376\n00:20:22.928 --> 00:20:27.690\nis another very common attack\nthat's performed on these servers.\n\n377\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.331\nWhere you basically make the server so\n\n378\n00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:34.871\nbusy that it can't respond\nto legitimate requests.\n\n379\n00:20:34.871 --> 00:20:38.935\nYou know, rather than attack it we\ncan just basically bring it offline.\n\n380\n00:20:38.935 --> 00:20:42.290\nI say bringing offline, it's not that we\nactually bring it offline but imagine\n\n381\n00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.494\na web server and people are hitting and\nsay hey give me your homepage, give me\n\n382\n00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:49.390\nyour homepage, and people opening up their\nbrowser and going into your website.\n\n383\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.600\nWe'll increase the amount of requests,\n100 fold,\n\n384\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.296\n1,000 fold, 10,000 fold, 100,000 fold.\n\n385\n00:20:56.296 --> 00:21:00.670\nAll of the sudden that web server can't\nkeep up, and it basically shuts down.\n\n386\n00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.458\nAnd the problem is, legitimate users,\nthere was a really cool one,\n\n387\n00:21:04.458 --> 00:21:07.394\nI say really cool,\nsometimes we have to look at this,\n\n388\n00:21:07.394 --> 00:21:11.210\nat the engineering behind it and\ngo wow, that is pretty impressive.\n\n389\n00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.361\nIf only you guys run the light\nside instead of the dark side,\n\n390\n00:21:14.361 --> 00:21:15.760\nthat will be really good.\n\n391\n00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:21.980\nBut they have made some malware\nthat attacked a web server with\n\n392\n00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:27.050\nillegitimate request but one of those\nprograms used to request once and stopped.\n\n393\n00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.000\nSo they had a thousand and hundreds of\nthousands of zombies that would make this\n\n394\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.290\nrequest at the same time, to try to\nflood their machine and bring it down.\n\n395\n00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.160\nWell, they got the bright idea,\nthis was very clever.\n\n396\n00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.970\nThey said, hey, why not just have\nit request over and over, and over,\n\n397\n00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:40.920\nand over again.\n\n398\n00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.090\nRetry the requests.\n\n399\n00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.070\nWhich was what normal users do, right?\n\n400\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.520\nYou go to a webpage,\nif your browser fails,\n\n401\n00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.980\nyour browser will usually try again or\nyou might hit refresh to try again.\n\n402\n00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.460\nSo you had malware doing this.\n\n403\n00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.010\nThen you've got legitimate users that\nare trying to get to the page and\n\n404\n00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:56.020\ncan't get to it.\n\n405\n00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.795\nSo they're actually now part of\nthe denial of service attack.\n\n406\n00:21:58.795 --> 00:22:00.275\nWhich is an interesting thought.\n\n407\n00:22:00.275 --> 00:22:04.624\nNow your legitimate users are part of the\nDoS issue because they're continuing to\n\n408\n00:22:04.624 --> 00:22:08.290\nrequest the page even though\nthe server's too busy.\n\n409\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.720\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I was gonna ask a question here.\n\n410\n00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.110\nNow, you've talked about\nthe server providing the services.\n\n411\n00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:16.040\nA lot of times, if I understand it right,\nit's the users requesting services.\n\n412\n00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.880\nSo what are the users sitting at?\n\n413\n00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.160\nThat become a point of\nresponsibilities as well.\n\n414\n00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.360\n&gt;&gt; It absolutely does so\n\n415\n00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:27.240\nyour end point can be a big source of\nattacks of vulnerability in your network.\n\n416\n00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.960\nMaybe for a little bit of a different\nreason where service are providing\n\n417\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.642\nservices and\n\n418\n00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:35.922\nthose are very common targets especially\nbecause a lot of them are public facing.\n\n419\n00:22:35.922 --> 00:22:37.966\nOr running services on open ports.\n\n420\n00:22:37.966 --> 00:22:44.060\nYour ends users, every company has an end\nuser who will click on anything, right?\n\n421\n00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.910\nThat was the big thing going\naround at RSA this year.\n\n422\n00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:52.655\nEvery company has at least one\nuser that will click on anything.\n\n423\n00:22:52.655 --> 00:22:56.860\nAnd that's a problem because that's how\na lot of these attacks get started.\n\n424\n00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.690\nI need to get into your network so\nI can burrow my way back out home and\n\n425\n00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.500\nstart setting up my attacks.\n\n426\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.950\nWell, how do I do that?\n\n427\n00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.800\nI send an email to your users and\nhope that they click on it.\n\n428\n00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.560\nI do phone calls.\n\n429\n00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.290\nI say, hey, look,\nthis is so-and-so with IT.\n\n430\n00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.220\nWe need to make sure,\nwe're setting up a new account database.\n\n431\n00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.065\nI need to make sure you have access.\n\n432\n00:23:14.065 --> 00:23:15.985\nWhat is your current username and\npassword, so\n\n433\n00:23:15.985 --> 00:23:18.270\nI can make sure that gets\ntransferred over, right?\n\n434\n00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.650\nLittle social engineering.\n\n435\n00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.940\nUsers are a part of our security system.\n\n436\n00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.600\nAnd a lot of organizations\ndon't spend enough time\n\n437\n00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.310\nmaking sure our users understand that.\n\n438\n00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:34.090\nThat they are just a big a part of\nsecurity as any firewall we put up there.\n\n439\n00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.010\nBecause it takes one user\nto prop the backdoor open.\n\n440\n00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.390\nTo wipe out all security\nthat you have in place.\n\n441\n00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.320\nSo users is a big problem with endpoints.\n\n442\n00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.440\nThey're running applications.\n\n443\n00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.380\nThe applications could\nhave vulnerabilities.\n\n444\n00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.390\nAnd we might not be as diligent when we're\nprotecting those endpoints of the user\n\n445\n00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:53.340\nsystems.\n\n446\n00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.681\nAs we focus a lot on our servers, and\n\n447\n00:23:55.681 --> 00:23:59.673\nsometimes we are a little more\nlax on those end user systems.\n\n448\n00:23:59.673 --> 00:24:00.950\nWe'll give them permission\nto install applications.\n\n449\n00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:06.117\nI recently dealt with a company\nWhere a user was basically,\n\n450\n00:24:06.117 --> 00:24:11.488\nthis company they allowed VPN access,\nlet me see what it was,\n\n451\n00:24:11.488 --> 00:24:16.260\nhe wanted to,\nthis person wanted to be able to search.\n\n452\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.295\nThey were unhappy with the Windows search,\n\n453\n00:24:18.295 --> 00:24:21.120\nI mean windows has search\ncapabilities built into it.\n\n454\n00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.640\nBut he found this third party\nprogram that he wanted to use.\n\n455\n00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.940\nHe thought it was better\nthan what was built in.\n\n456\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.120\nHe was denied, they said no,\nwe're not gonna install that.\n\n457\n00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.620\nAfter doing just a little bit of reading,\nwe can see that it's really not good.\n\n458\n00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.410\nIn fact, it potentially has\nmalware built right into it.\n\n459\n00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:41.950\nAnd it would search an index,\neverything on the system, system files.\n\n460\n00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.030\nIt would reach out to shares that you were\nconnected to and start indexing those.\n\n461\n00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.790\nReally scary stuff.\n\n462\n00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.317\nBecause he was an administrator\non his machine, he said yeah,\n\n463\n00:24:50.317 --> 00:24:51.950\nI know you told me no, but you know what?\n\n464\n00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.530\nI'm going to install it anyway.\n\n465\n00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.120\nAnd ended up having\nan issue with that machine.\n\n466\n00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.930\nIt got compromised and\nluckily didn't cause any further damage.\n\n467\n00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.143\nBut there's a case of where\nwe gave the end users too\n\n468\n00:25:02.143 --> 00:25:06.080\nmuch rights on their system and\nnow we've been compromised.\n\n469\n00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.090\nBecause they installed software\nthat was not approved or\n\n470\n00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.250\nhad not been thoroughly vetted yet\n\n471\n00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:15.860\nand caused a compromise which could\nhave lead to some serious data breach.\n\n472\n00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.330\n&gt;&gt; Always need to excercise that\nprinciple of least privilege.\n\n473\n00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:22.802\nNow you've talked about things like\nthe applications, the layer eight issue,\n\n474\n00:25:22.802 --> 00:25:24.453\nthe user like Wes if you will.\n\n475\n00:25:24.453 --> 00:25:27.663\nWe've talked about the servers Mike,\nhow about the network itself and\n\n476\n00:25:27.663 --> 00:25:30.820\nthe devices that are really responsible\nfor getting that traffic from\n\n477\n00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.090\nthe application that's causing problems or\nthe server itself?\n\n478\n00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:34.630\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n479\n00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:39.560\nYour network infrastructure is\nalso a big vulnerable or can be.\n\n480\n00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.470\nHave vulnerabilities,\nI guess I should say.\n\n481\n00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.470\nOne more thing I'll say\nabout the endpoints too,\n\n482\n00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.400\nis they're a very common pivot point.\n\n483\n00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:50.010\nThey're usually a first line in the\nattack, because they're easier to get to.\n\n484\n00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.795\nBecause I can that user\nto click on an email.\n\n485\n00:25:52.795 --> 00:25:57.125\nClick on a banner ad,\ndo something silly, and get me in.\n\n486\n00:25:57.125 --> 00:26:00.195\nAnd then from there, that's not\nthe system I ultimately want to get into.\n\n487\n00:26:00.195 --> 00:26:02.015\nThat's not where all\nthe good data resides.\n\n488\n00:26:02.015 --> 00:26:03.205\nBut now I'm in the network.\n\n489\n00:26:03.205 --> 00:26:05.490\nAnd so now I can run scans from inside.\n\n490\n00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.860\nAnd don't have to worry about\ntrying to do firewalking or\n\n491\n00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.850\ngetting past the firewalls and\nthings like that.\n\n492\n00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.310\nSo those end systems do\nbecome pivot-points.\n\n493\n00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.090\nBut network infrastructure.\n\n494\n00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.510\nWell, Wes, what devices do we\nhave out there on the network?\n\n495\n00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.820\nThink about what pieces make up\nyour network infrastructure.\n\n496\n00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.530\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first thing I think of\nare things like your switches, right?\n\n497\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.851\nThings like your routers that are actually\nmoving traffic between a network I might\n\n498\n00:26:25.851 --> 00:26:28.842\nnot even be attached to it, and\ndon't even have any security policies on,\n\n499\n00:26:28.842 --> 00:26:30.050\nsomething like that.\n\n500\n00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:34.406\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely a miss configured\nrouter is a big big vulnerability and\n\n501\n00:26:34.406 --> 00:26:36.050\nwe see this all the time.\n\n502\n00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:40.451\nEspecially in smaller shops where you\ndon't have people that are certified or\n\n503\n00:26:40.451 --> 00:26:44.319\ntrained in your particular routing\ntechnology that you're using,\n\n504\n00:26:44.319 --> 00:26:48.900\nthey're doing the best they can with\nthe limited resources they have.\n\n505\n00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.900\nBut maybe they put the rules\nin the wrong order.\n\n506\n00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.638\nAnd all of a sudden,\n\n507\n00:26:51.638 --> 00:26:54.380\nsome traffic is able to get through\nthat shouldn't be able to get through.\n\n508\n00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:56.990\nDoes your router set up to recognize?\n\n509\n00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:01.709\nYour internal IP range is 192.168.1.0/24.\n\n510\n00:27:01.709 --> 00:27:05.636\nWell, what if you see that address coming\nfrom the external interface on that router\n\n511\n00:27:05.636 --> 00:27:07.490\ncoming into the network?\n\n512\n00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.860\nVery common attack,\ndoing some IP spoofing.\n\n513\n00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.720\nYour router should know, hey.\n\n514\n00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.330\nThat IP address should not\ncome from the outside range.\n\n515\n00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.730\nIt should only be on this inside subnet.\n\n516\n00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.520\nAnd it shouldn't even let it go through.\n\n517\n00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.920\nBut if your router's not configured\nproperly, we can end up doing that.\n\n518\n00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.130\nSwitches, same thing.\n\n519\n00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:29.977\nEspecially with our VLAN switches, we can\nstart doing VLAN hopping or hot finger,\n\n520\n00:27:29.977 --> 00:27:32.760\nbasically, trunk attacks\non those switches.\n\n521\n00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.880\nThey become a vulnerability.\n\n522\n00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.680\nAnd even just a simple\ndenial of service attack.\n\n523\n00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.740\nIf I can't attack it and\n\n524\n00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.640\nuse it to gain access to something else,\nwhat if I just do a DUS attack on it?\n\n525\n00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:47.590\nI can bring your network down by\ndisabling or your router or your switch.\n\n526\n00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:52.933\n&gt;&gt; I think about the fact that there's\njust that exponential increase of BYOD,\n\n527\n00:27:52.933 --> 00:27:54.500\nand we need mobility.\n\n528\n00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.900\nSo the other thing I think of\nis wireless communications.\n\n529\n00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.300\nAnd I'm sure, Mike, we could spend a whole\nweek on just the fact that it's radiated\n\n530\n00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.640\ncommunications to begin with.\n\n531\n00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.820\nBut do our access points become one of\nthe these points of attack as well,\n\n532\n00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.440\nthat might have vulnerabilities\non them as well?\n\n533\n00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.040\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n534\n00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.570\nI know you and I have played around\nseveral times with WEP and cracking those.\n\n535\n00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.350\nAnd it's not all that difficult nowadays.\n\n536\n00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:19.830\nAnd even WPA I think is,\nwell, I shouldn't say that.\n\n537\n00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:23.960\nBecause I'm pretty sure at this\npoint WPA is still considered safe.\n\n538\n00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.934\nBut wireless access points, very common\nto have vulnerabilities associated with\n\n539\n00:28:28.934 --> 00:28:31.930\nthose because as you said,\nit's unbound media.\n\n540\n00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:37.460\nSo it does become more difficult to\nsecure with wired media or bound media.\n\n541\n00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.390\nI can at least say you\ncan have physical access.\n\n542\n00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:46.010\nYou've gotta be able to get inside and hit\na patch cable, or find a jack in the wall\n\n543\n00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:50.070\nthat's not monitored, or\nsomething like that to get in.\n\n544\n00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:53.800\nThrow a switch on the end of a cable and\nplug another computer into it,\n\n545\n00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.050\nyou know something like that.\n\n546\n00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:59.360\nWireless however being unbound, the\ninformation is just floating out there.\n\n547\n00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.480\nNow we've got a real problem\ntrying to contain that and\n\n548\n00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.190\ntrying to limit where that reaches.\n\n549\n00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:08.600\nI know that companies struggle\nwith this all the time.\n\n550\n00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.440\nI want good coverage,\nI want to make sure my users can roam\n\n551\n00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.820\naround the building from one side\nto the other and not drop signal.\n\n552\n00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.930\nBut at the same time, I don't want that\nsignal bleeding to the outside into\n\n553\n00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.860\nthe parking lot where somebody\ncan sit in that creepy van and\n\n554\n00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.660\nwork on my system all day long.\n\n555\n00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:29.080\nOr, to the building next to me, where\nmaybe the business next to me has some\n\n556\n00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.300\nunscrupulous employees, right,\nthat that wanna take advantage of that.\n\n557\n00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.259\nSo wireless can be a huge attack vector.\n\n558\n00:29:36.259 --> 00:29:40.460\n&gt;&gt; You know, thinking about wireless it\nreminds me of something I know you've said\n\n559\n00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.880\nto me many, many times and\njust the general concept of security.\n\n560\n00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.408\nIs as we start to try increase convenience\n\n561\n00:29:46.408 --> 00:29:50.900\nwe can start limit the ability of our\nsecurity platforms to do their jobs.\n\n562\n00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly right.\n\n563\n00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:56.660\nYou know, we always talk\nabout the what do we call it,\n\n564\n00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:01.255\nthe CIA Triad confidentiality\nintegrity availability.\n\n565\n00:30:01.255 --> 00:30:04.615\nAnd another one that\nwe'll talk about is the,\n\n566\n00:30:04.615 --> 00:30:07.716\nif you draw a triangle\non a piece of paper and\n\n567\n00:30:07.716 --> 00:30:13.510\non each point write ease of use at one\npoint, write functionality at one point.\n\n568\n00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:17.070\nAnd security at the third point and\nthen put your finger in the middle.\n\n569\n00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:21.370\nAnd then as you move around in that\ntriangle, as you move towards ease of use,\n\n570\n00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:26.260\nyou're moving away from functionality and\nsecurity because the easier I make it use,\n\n571\n00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.610\nhey you don't even have\nto put a password in.\n\n572\n00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.960\nYou just have to swipe your key FOB.\n\n573\n00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:36.000\nOne of those gas stations where you\ncan take the key FOB and just hit it.\n\n574\n00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.680\nYou don't have to enter PIN or anything.\n\n575\n00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.030\nThat's great ease of use for the customer.\n\n576\n00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:41.480\nFantastic.\n\n577\n00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.260\nUntil you drop your keys or leave your\nkeys somewhere and I pick it up and\n\n578\n00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.400\nI swipe it.\n\n579\n00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.180\nHow does it know it's not me?\n\n580\n00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.620\nThere's no pin, there's no nothing\nassociated with it, right?\n\n581\n00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.820\nSo we moved away from security.\n\n582\n00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.708\nIf you go down towards functionality,\nright,\n\n583\n00:30:52.708 --> 00:30:55.010\nyou're adding more\nfunctionality to a product.\n\n584\n00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.270\nYou're gonna make it\ninherently more complex,\n\n585\n00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.710\nwhich is gonna open up\nother attack avenues.\n\n586\n00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:03.562\nYou move toward security, lock it down,\nI'm moving away from ease of use and\n\n587\n00:31:03.562 --> 00:31:04.937\naway from functionality.\n\n588\n00:31:04.937 --> 00:31:08.791\nSo it's finding that balance in there,\nand wireless access points,\n\n589\n00:31:08.791 --> 00:31:11.550\nbeing one of them we have\nseen a lot of issues with.\n\n590\n00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:15.208\nMost people will push that out to the edge\nof your network rather than have that\n\n591\n00:31:15.208 --> 00:31:18.920\naccess point in your network,\nput it out there in your DMZ.\n\n592\n00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.923\nI'm not so worried about people connecting\nto it now, it's what they can do once they\n\n593\n00:31:22.923 --> 00:31:25.440\nare connected and\nI've got a very tight rules about.\n\n594\n00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.060\nWhat's going on inside of that wireless\naccess point from that point in.\n\n595\n00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.040\nI don't care, Wes,\nif you hit my access point.\n\n596\n00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.470\nI know you're not going to get\nanywhere past that, right?\n\n597\n00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:38.786\nBecause I can't- I'm going to have trouble\nsecuring the wireless access point itself,\n\n598\n00:31:38.786 --> 00:31:40.735\nbut I can secure from that point behind.\n\n599\n00:31:40.735 --> 00:31:44.525\nSo one of the ways we might look\nat reducing the attack vectors on\n\n600\n00:31:44.525 --> 00:31:45.875\nthose wireless access points.\n\n601\n00:31:45.875 --> 00:31:47.355\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\nthat's a lot of great information.\n\n602\n00:31:47.355 --> 00:31:50.275\nWe certainly hope you're starting\nto realize that even the smallest\n\n603\n00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:54.140\nvulnerability can lead up to lots of\ndollars in cost for your company.\n\n604\n00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.630\nNow, I'm looking at the time clock here.\n\n605\n00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.869\nIt does look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode, but\n\n606\n00:31:57.869 --> 00:32:00.530\nI'm also looking at this list of bullet\npoints and it looks like we have more.\n\n607\n00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.440\nSo we might have to go into a part two.\n\n608\n00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.260\nSo what do you say, Mike?\n\n609\n00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.597\nWe go ahead and\nbring this one into a part two, but\n\n610\n00:32:06.597 --> 00:32:08.976\nbefore we do do you\nhave any parting words?\n\n611\n00:32:08.976 --> 00:32:10.432\n&gt;&gt; No.\nI'll save them for part two.\n\n612\n00:32:10.432 --> 00:32:13.094\n&gt;&gt; All right, that sounds like a great\nplace then to end this one, as always\n\n613\n00:32:13.094 --> 00:32:16.210\nMike, we appreciate having you here and\nwe appreciate having you the viewers here.\n\n614\n00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.790\nSigning out for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, West Bryan.\n\n615\n00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:19.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n616\n00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.250\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.785\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV, I'm your host,\n\n4\n00:00:15.785 --> 00:00:16.455\nWes Bryan.\n\n5\n00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:17.335\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:21.545\nwe are continuing through our series in\nCompTIA's cyber security analyst plus.\n\n7\n00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:24.545\nAnd joining us back in the studios\nis none other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:25.491\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:29.679\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, Wes thanks for having me\nback, excited to be here as always, and\n\n10\n00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.303\nwe are continuing our thought\nprocess on common vulnerabilities.\n\n11\n00:00:33.303 --> 00:00:35.832\nAnd looking at\nvulnerabilities of different\n\n12\n00:00:35.832 --> 00:00:37.967\nsystems on our network face, right?\n\n13\n00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:43.440\nWe've talked a little bit about servers\nand endpoints, we've also talked\n\n14\n00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.340\nabout the network infrastructure, routers,\nswitches, wireless access points.\n\n15\n00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.896\nThey're all with their vulnerabilities\nthat they're susceptible to network\n\n16\n00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:55.820\nappliances would be next\non our list from CompTIA.\n\n17\n00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.294\nWhen we talk about our network appliance,\nit is weird,\n\n18\n00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:00.305\nit depends on who you talk to and\neverything.\n\n19\n00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:03.309\nI mean, some people will say that\na router is a network appliance,\n\n20\n00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.250\nI typically think of it as\nnetwork infrastructure.\n\n21\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.400\nBut it is still an appliance\non my network, so it could be,\n\n22\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.220\nit could fall under these.\n\n23\n00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.400\nBut when I think of network appliances,\nI typically think of boxes designed for\n\n24\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.340\na specific purpose which\nagain defines a router,\n\n25\n00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.250\nso I'm not doing much good\nfrom my own definition here.\n\n26\n00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.026\nBut in this case, with CompTIA,\nour network appliances,\n\n27\n00:01:26.026 --> 00:01:30.332\nwe're gonna be talking about\nthings like proxies, spam filters,\n\n28\n00:01:30.332 --> 00:01:36.395\nnetwork intrusion prevention systems,\nnetwork-based intrusion detection systems.\n\n29\n00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:40.225\nThese are just devices, specific built\ndevices that kind of plug into our network\n\n30\n00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:41.675\nand they do some job, right?\n\n31\n00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:44.042\nThat's a network appliance and\n\n32\n00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:48.780\nthese are definitely points of\nentry into our network, right?\n\n33\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.773\nWhen we look at proxies, a proxy server,\nif you're unfamiliar with that.\n\n34\n00:01:53.773 --> 00:01:58.789\nWe filter all of our outbound web\ntraffic through a proxy because that\n\n35\n00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.806\ngives us a chance as a network\nadministrator to filter that traffic,\n\n36\n00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:07.195\nto control what websites\nare allowed to go to.\n\n37\n00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:09.458\nHide the internal IP address range,\n\n38\n00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:13.991\nwe're typical doing network address\ntranslation at that point as well.\n\n39\n00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:18.366\nBut that definitely becomes a attack\nvector that people can use.\n\n40\n00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:21.179\nA lot of times though,\nit's trying to bypass the proxy,\n\n41\n00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.030\nit's what the internal\nusers are trying to do.\n\n42\n00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.920\nAnd that's something that,\nthis is a little,\n\n43\n00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.480\nquick detour,\nsomething I haven't mentioned yet.\n\n44\n00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.030\nI keep talking about bad actors or\nthreat actors and hackers.\n\n45\n00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.320\nI don't want us to forget that\n\n46\n00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.200\ninsiders are also a potential threat\nagainst our network, all right?\n\n47\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.544\nIn fact, insiders are probably\na bigger threat than what you think.\n\n48\n00:02:46.544 --> 00:02:50.691\nThey're probably a bigger threat than\nsome of your external threats that you\n\n49\n00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:53.450\nare spending a lot of money to protect and\nkeep out.\n\n50\n00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.970\nAnd then not spending a lot of\ntime on the insiders, right?\n\n51\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.170\nBecause a person inside your network,\nthat's what the bad guys are trying to do.\n\n52\n00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.940\nThey're trying to get into your network,\nthe disgruntled employee is\n\n53\n00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.700\nalready in your network as physical access\nto the building has a user account and\n\n54\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.210\npassword they can log\non to the system with.\n\n55\n00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.010\nSo there, already halfway there, all they\nhave to do is escalate their credentials.\n\n56\n00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.440\nAnd if it's a mismanaged network and\n\n57\n00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.140\nall you users are admins on our own\nmachines, even worse, so don't forget.\n\n58\n00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.630\nSo when we say proxy's\ngonna be an attack point,\n\n59\n00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.760\nfrom the inside as well as\nfrom the outside, what else?\n\n60\n00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.700\nSo for network appliances, one of\nthe issues you have trying to protect\n\n61\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.800\nnetwork appliances is they're\ntypically not open source.\n\n62\n00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.850\nYou can't get access to the code, how do\n\n63\n00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.750\nyou know that that appliance doesn't\nhave any vulnerabilities of its own?\n\n64\n00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.760\nThis is when we've got to buy, we've\ngot to use our vulnerability scanners.\n\n65\n00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.560\nWe look to see if there's any plug ins\nfrom that particular vendor, looking for\n\n66\n00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.115\ntheir best practices on\nhow to secure the machine.\n\n67\n00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:58.543\nCuz remember vulnerabilities is not\njust just a flaw on the software for\n\n68\n00:03:58.543 --> 00:04:03.803\nexample, it can be misconfiguration\nit's still a vulnerability.\n\n69\n00:04:03.803 --> 00:04:07.413\nSo if you don't know how to configure that\ndevice, if you don't know what it's all of\n\n70\n00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:10.294\nits capabilities are and\nyou just turn all the switches on, right?\n\n71\n00:04:10.294 --> 00:04:15.250\nAll the switches on, and let it go to\ntown what have you opened up, right?\n\n72\n00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.290\nWe've talked about that and when we talk\nabout hardening servers, we talked about\n\n73\n00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.809\nonly running necessary services, disabling\nunnecessary ports, unnecessary services.\n\n74\n00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:27.118\nSame thing with these appliances but\nwe have to understand them.\n\n75\n00:04:27.118 --> 00:04:29.569\nAll right, we have to make\nsure we talk to the vendor,\n\n76\n00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.737\nwe know what it's capable of we know\nwhat features we want to enable.\n\n77\n00:04:32.737 --> 00:04:35.362\nWhat features we might want to disable and\n\n78\n00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:38.850\ndo they update their firmware regularly,\nright?\n\n79\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.610\nAs usual then that goes\nback to the other stuff we\n\n80\n00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.770\ntalked about as well with network\ninfrastructures, routers, switches,\n\n81\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.120\nupdating the firmware on those is\ngonna help keep you less vulnerable.\n\n82\n00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.440\nBecause as they discover vulnerabilities\nin their equipment, they will release\n\n83\n00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.180\npatches or updated firmware that you can\napply to their systems to keep you safe.\n\n84\n00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.553\nBut if you're running an appliance you\nhaven't updated there for three years,\n\n85\n00:05:00.553 --> 00:05:02.895\nthat could definitely be\nconsidered a vulnerability.\n\n86\n00:05:02.895 --> 00:05:06.528\n&gt;&gt; And this ties back into something\nthat you taught up in a previous\n\n87\n00:05:06.528 --> 00:05:09.222\nepisode about things\nlike asset management and\n\n88\n00:05:09.222 --> 00:05:12.334\nasset inventory is really\nknowing what do I even have.\n\n89\n00:05:12.334 --> 00:05:16.400\nCuz I've mentioned too in other episodes\nwhere we had to contract in on this\n\n90\n00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.655\none network appliance,\nit was a storage appliance.\n\n91\n00:05:19.655 --> 00:05:23.097\nAnd sure enough, when we let the service\ncontract go the firmware updates also\n\n92\n00:05:23.097 --> 00:05:24.622\nwent with that service contract.\n\n93\n00:05:24.622 --> 00:05:27.081\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And, Mike, in your defense too, and\n\n94\n00:05:27.081 --> 00:05:29.707\nsome of the definition of some of these,\nI mean, really today.\n\n95\n00:05:29.707 --> 00:05:33.166\nAren't we seeing that when we say network\nappliance, you know we talk about a proxy,\n\n96\n00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.233\nwe talk about a firewall.\n\n97\n00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:37.485\nA lot of these can be multi-functioning\ndevices, where all of that role,\n\n98\n00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:41.012\neven though we're separating them\nphysically here or logically, if you will.\n\n99\n00:05:41.012 --> 00:05:45.176\nThere still could be all-in-one device,\nwhich means you could be applying\n\n100\n00:05:45.176 --> 00:05:49.097\nvulnerability scanning on multiple\nlevels on a single device, right?\n\n101\n00:05:49.097 --> 00:05:53.374\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely, and there's\ncontroversy there in do you go with\n\n102\n00:05:53.374 --> 00:05:57.801\na multifunction device or do you\nhave individual devices to do their,\n\n103\n00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:00.590\nwhat they are specifically designed to do.\n\n104\n00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.813\nThe multifunction of devices is fantastic,\nbecause it got one administrative\n\n105\n00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:07.090\ninterface that I can go to and\nI can manage.\n\n106\n00:06:08.122 --> 00:06:12.480\nThe downside of that is if there is\na compromise or a vulnerability in there.\n\n107\n00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.220\nIt could potentially compromise all of\nthe services that device is running.\n\n108\n00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.480\nIf it gets a deniable of service,\nit doesn't take out just one function,\n\n109\n00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.190\nit takes out all the functions typically.\n\n110\n00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.490\nSo we gotta weigh the pros and cons of\nthose multi-function devices as well.\n\n111\n00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.070\nAnd then we get into the virtual world,\nand\n\n112\n00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.010\nwe start looking at virtual networks and\nvirtual infrastructure.\n\n113\n00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.450\nAnd really, when it comes to\nvirtualization, we've gotta think,\n\n114\n00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.440\nit kinda depends on how I feel that day.\n\n115\n00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.460\nOne side of me says, virtualization,\nwhen I look at a virtual machine, right,\n\n116\n00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.410\nit's no different than\na physical computer,\n\n117\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.120\nin the fact that it's\nrunning an operating system.\n\n118\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.440\nIt's running applications or\nservices or whatever it's doing and\n\n119\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.160\nall those vulnerabilities carry right\nover into whether it's physical or\n\n120\n00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.940\nwhether it's virtual.\n\n121\n00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.450\nSo we really need to protect it,\njust like we do physical machines,\n\n122\n00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.630\nback when everything was physical.\n\n123\n00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.710\nWe still gotta do the same kind of things,\nwe have to scan them,\n\n124\n00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.355\nwe have to update them, patch them,\nconfigure them properly.\n\n125\n00:07:11.355 --> 00:07:13.815\nSo in that respect,\nit's no different than a physical machine.\n\n126\n00:07:13.815 --> 00:07:16.735\n&gt;&gt; Well, what about the device themselves\nthat all of those virtual machines\n\n127\n00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:17.295\nare running on?\n\n128\n00:07:17.295 --> 00:07:19.275\nThat seems like,\nwhat you were just explaining,\n\n129\n00:07:19.275 --> 00:07:21.907\nthat the multi functioning device could\nbe a single point of failure, Mike.\n\n130\n00:07:21.907 --> 00:07:26.022\nWhat if I take the time and I update and\ndo the server hardening on VM 01, 02,\n\n131\n00:07:26.022 --> 00:07:29.602\n03, 04, but\nthen what about what they're running on?\n\n132\n00:07:29.602 --> 00:07:33.592\nSo that could be a single point of failure\nor from a vulnerability standpoint, right?\n\n133\n00:07:33.592 --> 00:07:34.943\n&gt;&gt; Yes, for sure, yeah,\n\n134\n00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:39.200\nif you're running all of your virtual\nservers on a single physical host and\n\n135\n00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.947\nthat physical host becomes a single point\nof failure, it becomes an attack point.\n\n136\n00:07:43.947 --> 00:07:48.691\nIf I can get into the management\nsystem of your virtualization product,\n\n137\n00:07:48.691 --> 00:07:52.908\nwhether that's Hyper-V or\nVM Ware or whatever the case may be.\n\n138\n00:07:52.908 --> 00:07:57.666\nFrom there I can most likely get into\nyour virtual machines At the least,\n\n139\n00:07:57.666 --> 00:08:01.890\nI can restart them, or shut them down,\nor delete them, right?\n\n140\n00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.080\nIf I can get into the management system\nof your virtualization platform.\n\n141\n00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.207\nSo that becomes an added vulnerability.\n\n142\n00:08:07.207 --> 00:08:10.879\nAnd as I was just saying, one side of me\nsays virtual machines are no different\n\n143\n00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.530\nthan the other physical machine.\n\n144\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.080\nAs far as how we have to protect them and\nlook at them.\n\n145\n00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.560\nBut there is added vulnerabilities\nbecause they are virtual.\n\n146\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.240\nWith virtual servers,\na lot of times we're running,\n\n147\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.970\nlet's say you're a service provider.\n\n148\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.950\nYou've got multiple companies\nthat you're hosting VM's for.\n\n149\n00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.346\nHow do you keep that traffic segregated?\n\n150\n00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:36.520\nI got to make sure company a, there's no\nway that they can get access to company\n\n151\n00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.510\nb's network and data that's traveling\nacross that network, right?\n\n152\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.910\nIt's all the same physical cabling,\nbut somehow we've gotta VLAN this,\n\n153\n00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.095\nwe've got it segregated out.\n\n154\n00:08:45.095 --> 00:08:48.750\nSoftware-defined networking is the big,\nbig thing right now so\n\n155\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.780\nthat we can do things like that.\n\n156\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.090\nBecause we see that\nvulnerability there that,\n\n157\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.960\nif I can compromise one VM,\nnow that becomes my pivot point.\n\n158\n00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.951\nI can start to attempt to work my\nway to other virtual machines,\n\n159\n00:08:59.951 --> 00:09:03.957\npotentially crossing organizational\nboundaries with that.\n\n160\n00:09:03.957 --> 00:09:07.910\n&gt;&gt; Mike, earlier, in the first part we had\ntalked about things like access points.\n\n161\n00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.640\nAnd the fact that with bring your own\ndevice mobility is becoming a big thing.\n\n162\n00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.520\nBut we were really only talking about it\nfrom the perspective of the device that\n\n163\n00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.060\ngives those other devices access.\n\n164\n00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.970\nHelp me out with the mobile devices.\n\n165\n00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.390\nThat has to be something that's\njust an ever growing concern.\n\n166\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.610\nJust because, it's the fact\nthat I can reach out here and\n\n167\n00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.050\nI can grab my cellphone out.\n\n168\n00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.890\nIt's mine, but you, as an administrator,\n\n169\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.950\ndo you know if I've got\na firewall running on there?\n\n170\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.060\nDo I got the current antivirus software?\n\n171\n00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.000\nSo I can only imagine that\n\n172\n00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.959\nmobility is going to be something\nwe have to worry about as well.\n\n173\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.220\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it makes me shudder,\nit really does.\n\n174\n00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.060\nBecause it's difficult, right?\n\n175\n00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.920\nBYOD, the whole bring your own device\nthat I think you mentioned in an earlier\n\n176\n00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.400\nepisode, everybody has mobile devices.\n\n177\n00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.840\nIn fact, Wes,\nhow many do you have with you today?\n\n178\n00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.890\n&gt;&gt; Three.\n\n179\n00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's a light day for Wes.\n\n180\n00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.760\nHe's only got one backpack\non his shoulder today.\n\n181\n00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.580\nAnd this is the way most\nof our users are nowadays.\n\n182\n00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.410\nYou've got your your phone,\nyou've got a tablet.\n\n183\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:07.400\nYou've got your laptop, so\nthere's typically three with every person.\n\n184\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.563\nAnd, yes, as you said,\nhow do we manage those?\n\n185\n00:10:09.563 --> 00:10:13.120\nHow do I make sure that\nyour device is secure?\n\n186\n00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.163\nCan I tell you not to install\nthis application on your phone,\n\n187\n00:10:16.163 --> 00:10:19.336\nbecause it's got known\nvulnerabilities associated with it?\n\n188\n00:10:19.336 --> 00:10:21.449\nIs it a company-provided device, or\n\n189\n00:10:21.449 --> 00:10:25.390\nis it your own personal device\nthat you also use for company?\n\n190\n00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.480\nThere's legal battles that are dealing\nwith this, trying to figure out\n\n191\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.750\nwhere the liability lies for some of\nthis when it comes to mobile devices.\n\n192\n00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.060\nI wrote down some facts that I dug\nup right before the show here.\n\n193\n00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.045\n8% percent of companies\nenforce OS updates, 8%.\n\n194\n00:10:42.045 --> 00:10:46.078\nThat means there's,\nif I do my math right [LAUGH] 92% of\n\n195\n00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:51.380\nthe companies do not enforce OS\nupdates on their mobile devices.\n\n196\n00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:56.010\nSo Wes might be running a phone\nthat's five versions old.\n\n197\n00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.920\nThat has many, many,\nmany known vulnerabilities.\n\n198\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.800\nAnd it's connecting to my\nnetwork here at work, right?\n\n199\n00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.880\nThat's an entry point, that's an access\nway or an attack vector for the bad guys.\n\n200\n00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.280\n40% of companies have missing devices,\nthey're just gone, right?\n\n201\n00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.090\nDon't know what happened to them, somebody\nleft them somewhere, they got stolen,\n\n202\n00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.470\nthey got lost.\n\n203\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.150\nWell what do we do about that?\n\n204\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.513\nHow do I deal with securing that?\n\n205\n00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:24.777\nSo it's very important when we look\nat dealing with mobile devices today,\n\n206\n00:11:24.777 --> 00:11:25.800\nthat we sit down.\n\n207\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:32.420\nAnd we think about how we're gonna\nprotect our network from these guys.\n\n208\n00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.784\nA lot of phones are getting\nbetter at being able\n\n209\n00:11:35.784 --> 00:11:39.860\nto segregate work data from private data,\nright?\n\n210\n00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.982\nSo that I can do a remote\nwipe on that phone,\n\n211\n00:11:41.982 --> 00:11:43.580\nlet's say you leave the organization.\n\n212\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.720\nI can do a remote wipe, but\n\n213\n00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.810\nonly wipe the company data,\nnot your personal information.\n\n214\n00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.934\nBut phones are also a great way\nto exfilitrate information.\n\n215\n00:11:52.934 --> 00:11:57.100\nThat becomes another problem, we can tell\nthem, look, no thumb drives are allowed.\n\n216\n00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.141\nI don't need a thumb drive, I've got\na phone that has how much storage on it?\n\n217\n00:12:00.141 --> 00:12:04.677\nIt's got a great camera built\ninto it that I can zoom in with.\n\n218\n00:12:04.677 --> 00:12:10.330\nIt's got Bluetooth, it's got Wi-Fi,\nit's scary to think about.\n\n219\n00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.001\n&gt;&gt; You said something that I\nthought was kinda interesting.\n\n220\n00:12:12.001 --> 00:12:16.610\nYou said private data versus company data,\nright?\n\n221\n00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.660\nWell we have applications that\ncan kinda cross that line.\n\n222\n00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.300\nAnd they can bring that company data\ninto the realm that it would never be\n\n223\n00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:23.860\nmeant to be.\n\n224\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.850\nSo that can be a vulnerability,\nas well, right?\n\n225\n00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.530\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nI read an interesting article.\n\n226\n00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.950\nI can't remember who published this,\nit might have been Sands.\n\n227\n00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.830\nBut, Common Blacklisted\nConsumer Unmanaged Apps.\n\n228\n00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.540\nAnd this is what a lot of\norganizations are doing.\n\n229\n00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.840\nThey're saying, all right,\nyou can bring your phone in,\n\n230\n00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.300\nbut these apps are not allowed.\n\n231\n00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.183\nThings like Facebook, Twitter, Skype,\nLine, social media type applications.\n\n232\n00:12:46.183 --> 00:12:53.183\nStorage applications, OneDrive, Google\nDrive, what's the other one, Dropbox?\n\n233\n00:12:53.183 --> 00:12:57.130\nThese are all, basically,\nunmanaged Applications.\n\n234\n00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:02.055\nAs a system admin, I can't manage your\nDropbox account, and I can't control.\n\n235\n00:13:02.055 --> 00:13:06.750\nSo you can use that again, to exfiltrate\ndata, right out of my organization.\n\n236\n00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.070\nMobile devices do become a big,\nbig, big problem.\n\n237\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:16.997\nAnd I think it's going to continue as more\nand more people bring smartphones and\n\n238\n00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:20.392\ntablets and\nother mobile devices into the workplace.\n\n239\n00:13:20.392 --> 00:13:24.704\nAs we start blurring that line\nbetween corporate resources and\n\n240\n00:13:24.704 --> 00:13:28.920\npersonal resources,\nit becomes difficult to manage.\n\n241\n00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.397\nI know you’ve done several shows on,\nMicrosoft has a product called the Intune.\n\n242\n00:13:33.397 --> 00:13:37.724\nThat allows me to start to attempt\nto bring those devices in and\n\n243\n00:13:37.724 --> 00:13:40.540\nbe able to apply policies to them.\n\n244\n00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.530\nI know a few years ago with,\n\n245\n00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:47.118\nmy parents both were professors\nout here at University of Florida.\n\n246\n00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:50.225\nAnd, with their devices they\ncould bring them in and\n\n247\n00:13:50.225 --> 00:13:53.920\nconnected with the network only if\nthey had the pass code enabled.\n\n248\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.945\nRight, see,\nthat's very simple thing, obviously.\n\n249\n00:13:56.945 --> 00:14:02.000\nAnd, even the pass codes on those of\nphones are not a super strong method of\n\n250\n00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.110\nsecurity.\n\n251\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.882\nBut it's building blocks,\nit's layers of defense, right?\n\n252\n00:14:06.882 --> 00:14:10.265\nIf they brought their device in and\nthey've disabled the passcode feature on\n\n253\n00:14:10.265 --> 00:14:12.930\ntheir phone, it would no longer\nconnect to their networks.\n\n254\n00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.535\nIt would not be allowed to\nconnect to the networks.\n\n255\n00:14:15.535 --> 00:14:17.890\nAnd these are the things that we're\nhaving to implement nowadays.\n\n256\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:18.610\nIs we've gotta stop and\n\n257\n00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:22.240\nthink about what devices are being brought\nin on our network, do we wanna limit them?\n\n258\n00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.794\nHow are we going to go\nabout controlling this?\n\n259\n00:14:24.794 --> 00:14:30.340\nSo big, big attack vector there,\nthen we've got inter-connected networks.\n\n260\n00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.500\nAnd we talked about this in\nour first episode on this.\n\n261\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.230\nOur previous episode, where we\ntalked about some of the common or\n\n262\n00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:40.285\nthe current breaches that have occurred,\nlike Home Depot and Target and Sony.\n\n263\n00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:45.611\nYeah, you look at these and, Home Depot,\n\n264\n00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:47.460\nfor example,\nI was trying to think of one of them.\n\n265\n00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.910\nHome Depot was an issue where if that\nPOS network, the Point Of Sale network,\n\n266\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.570\nhad been segregated from the rest\nof their corporate network,\n\n267\n00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.335\nthe data breach wouldn't have\nbeen nearly as great, right?\n\n268\n00:14:58.335 --> 00:15:00.638\nThey still would have got information\noff those Point Of Sales.\n\n269\n00:15:00.638 --> 00:15:04.174\nBut they wouldn't have been able\nto get into corporate data,\n\n270\n00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:06.486\npotentially intellectual property and\n\n271\n00:15:06.486 --> 00:15:09.891\nwhatever else they were able to\nget out of Home Depot there.\n\n272\n00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:13.971\nOne of the things, when we look at data\nbreaches, the data's more valuable\n\n273\n00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:17.620\nthe more data you have, or\ncan correlate, the more valuable it is.\n\n274\n00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.231\nIf I can get a list of phone numbers,\nwell, that's great.\n\n275\n00:15:22.231 --> 00:15:25.583\nBut if I can get phone numbers and name,\nIf I could start tying this together,\n\n276\n00:15:25.583 --> 00:15:27.501\nthat's even more valuable to the bad guys.\n\n277\n00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:29.151\nSo the more data I can get,\n\n278\n00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:32.870\nthe more valuable it is as\nfar as the bad actors go.\n\n279\n00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:37.517\nSo segregating out networks,\nthey become pivot points.\n\n280\n00:15:37.517 --> 00:15:44.171\nI know Offensive Security has a great\nset of labs that we've gone through.\n\n281\n00:15:44.171 --> 00:15:46.037\nWhere, you attack one network,\n\n282\n00:15:46.037 --> 00:15:50.109\nyou can't get to this other network\nuntil you breach the first network.\n\n283\n00:15:50.109 --> 00:15:52.644\nOnce you're in the fist network,\nthen you're looking for\n\n284\n00:15:52.644 --> 00:15:55.799\nhosts that then have permission to\nconnect to the other network, right?\n\n285\n00:15:55.799 --> 00:16:00.193\nSo pivoting from one point to the other,\nto get from one network to the other.\n\n286\n00:16:00.193 --> 00:16:02.815\nPartners is a big, big, big issue.\n\n287\n00:16:02.815 --> 00:16:08.710\nWhen we look at supporting extranets,\nallowing other organizations.\n\n288\n00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.504\nI'm a raw-material supplier,\n\n289\n00:16:10.504 --> 00:16:14.793\nand I need the manufacturers to be able\nto come into my network and place orders,\n\n290\n00:16:14.793 --> 00:16:19.292\ncheck on quantity, or when their order's\ngonna be fulfilled, things like that.\n\n291\n00:16:19.292 --> 00:16:21.040\nSo I give them access to my network.\n\n292\n00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.640\nMaybe we do that through,\n\n293\n00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.870\nI don't know, some type of federated\nservices or what have you.\n\n294\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.490\nWell now,\nthat is an extension of my network.\n\n295\n00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:33.530\nEven though I might not see that right\naway, their network is now an extension\n\n296\n00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.070\nof my network because their\nnetwork has access to my network.\n\n297\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.320\nSo if somebody's able to\nbreach their network,\n\n298\n00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.820\nthey can then use that as\na way to get into my network.\n\n299\n00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.910\nTheir network wasn't the original target,\nright?\n\n300\n00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.640\nBut they know I'm a business partner\nwith them, and they know that that\n\n301\n00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.100\ncompany is smaller and probably don't\nhave the same resources that I do, so\n\n302\n00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.090\nthey attack them first and\nuse that as a way to get into my network.\n\n303\n00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.920\nWe see this quite often.\n\n304\n00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.345\n&gt;&gt; So it's probably one of the reasons\nwe need to use those things.\n\n305\n00:16:59.345 --> 00:17:02.625\nWe always sometimes talk about\nthe bureaucracy behind security, right?\n\n306\n00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:06.165\nWe have to follow those ISAs,\ninterconnection side agreements,\n\n307\n00:17:06.165 --> 00:17:10.052\nthat define the liability, and how\na company's gonna connect to my network.\n\n308\n00:17:10.052 --> 00:17:13.452\nSo maybe, for example,\na bank has a set of mortgages, and\n\n309\n00:17:13.452 --> 00:17:15.372\na mortgage company wants to come in and\nbuy them up.\n\n310\n00:17:15.372 --> 00:17:19.670\nWell, on both sides of the tracks there\nyou have federal requirements, I'm sure.\n\n311\n00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.036\nAnd you have to define those ways that we\nmake those connections to make sure that\n\n312\n00:17:23.036 --> 00:17:24.857\nboth sides are doing their due diligence.\n\n313\n00:17:24.857 --> 00:17:28.494\nOr like you say, they become pivot points\nwhere maybe I wasn't the intended target,\n\n314\n00:17:28.494 --> 00:17:32.186\nbut I can definitely be the avenue for\nthe target that they do intend to attack.\n\n315\n00:17:32.186 --> 00:17:36.093\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, do not be afraid if\nyour organization does its job and\n\n316\n00:17:36.093 --> 00:17:39.445\nwe're doing vulnerability\nassessments once a month and\n\n317\n00:17:39.445 --> 00:17:43.724\nwe're having an outside audit done\nperiodically to check our systems.\n\n318\n00:17:43.724 --> 00:17:47.038\nAnd now we're going to hire this\nvendor to provide a service, and\n\n319\n00:17:47.038 --> 00:17:49.590\nthey're gonna need access to our network.\n\n320\n00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.710\nDon't be afraid to ask them,\nhey, what do you guys do?\n\n321\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.712\nHow often do you do\nvulnerability assessments?\n\n322\n00:17:54.712 --> 00:17:58.829\nWhere's your third party audit report\nthat I wanna look at to see how\n\n323\n00:17:58.829 --> 00:17:59.921\nyour network is?\n\n324\n00:17:59.921 --> 00:18:01.976\nAnd if they can't provide\nthat information,\n\n325\n00:18:01.976 --> 00:18:04.563\nI'm gonna find another vendor,\nsomebody else that can.\n\n326\n00:18:04.563 --> 00:18:07.374\nBecause, again,\nI'm trying to protect my network.\n\n327\n00:18:07.374 --> 00:18:11.630\nJust because, you know, [LAUGH] That's\ntheir network, let them worry about it.\n\n328\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.390\nNot if they're going to attach to yours.\n\n329\n00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.241\nInterconnected networks is one\nof those things that, I think,\n\n330\n00:18:17.241 --> 00:18:19.597\nadministrators sometimes overlook or\n\n331\n00:18:19.597 --> 00:18:23.608\nmaybe just turn a blind eye to\nbecause it's gonna be troublesome.\n\n332\n00:18:23.608 --> 00:18:25.886\n[LAUGH] It's gonna be a little\nbit of work to try to, great,\n\n333\n00:18:25.886 --> 00:18:28.984\nI've already gotta worry about my network,\nnow I've gotta worry about theirs.\n\n334\n00:18:28.984 --> 00:18:31.364\nIt's not that you have to go\nsecure their network, but\n\n335\n00:18:31.364 --> 00:18:34.365\nyou definitely have to ask the right\nquestions and make sure that they\n\n336\n00:18:34.365 --> 00:18:37.338\nare doing what they are supposed to\ndo in doing their due diligence.\n\n337\n00:18:37.338 --> 00:18:39.818\n&gt;&gt; You know, Mike,\nyou've thrown out a security technology or\n\n338\n00:18:39.818 --> 00:18:40.972\ntechnique that we use a lot.\n\n339\n00:18:40.972 --> 00:18:45.410\nIn fact, it goes back to the early days,\nor early 90s there with Microsoft now.\n\n340\n00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.730\nAnd I can think of this topic\nbeing one that hey, once I set it,\n\n341\n00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.000\nI don't have to worry about it,\nit should be secure.\n\n342\n00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.412\nBut things like VPNs,\nvirtual private networks,\n\n343\n00:18:53.412 --> 00:18:56.509\nnow we have to worry about some\nconfiguration issues on this too.\n\n344\n00:18:56.509 --> 00:19:00.345\nBecause how we set it up might dictate\nwhether that VPN's actually providing\n\n345\n00:19:00.345 --> 00:19:02.303\nthe security we need, right?\n\n346\n00:19:02.303 --> 00:19:06.303\n&gt;&gt; Yes, VPNs can be, what's a good way\nto say it, give you a false sense of\n\n347\n00:19:06.303 --> 00:19:09.533\nsecurity sometimes,\nif you're not careful with them.\n\n348\n00:19:09.533 --> 00:19:11.700\nIt's definitely, you know,\nwe love VPNs, right?\n\n349\n00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.779\nBecause we're making a VPN, virtual\nprivate network, where we're connecting,\n\n350\n00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:21.642\nmaybe I'm at home and I wanna connect into\nmy work network to get some resources or\n\n351\n00:19:21.642 --> 00:19:23.591\ndo some work, or what have you.\n\n352\n00:19:23.591 --> 00:19:27.199\nAnd we're connecting across a public\ninfrastructure, the Internet,\n\n353\n00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:28.925\nthat I have no control over.\n\n354\n00:19:28.925 --> 00:19:30.335\nSo we use a VPN, or\n\n355\n00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:34.295\nvirtual private network technology,\nthat basically creates a tunnel.\n\n356\n00:19:34.295 --> 00:19:39.289\nIt's gonna take your normal protocol\nthat you're using to communicate,\n\n357\n00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:43.091\nTCPIP, gonna wrap it up inside a,\nor encapsulate that,\n\n358\n00:19:43.091 --> 00:19:46.837\ninside a VPN protocol,\nwhich is hopefully encrypted.\n\n359\n00:19:46.837 --> 00:19:49.438\nAnd now as it travels\nacross the public network,\n\n360\n00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:53.887\neven if people intercept that traffic,\nwhich they are or will, it's encrypted.\n\n361\n00:19:53.887 --> 00:19:56.990\nAnd they hopefully can't get access to it.\n\n362\n00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.950\nSo VPNs are great, and\nthey should be used all the time.\n\n363\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.630\nWe make sure we wanna enforce VPN usage.\n\n364\n00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.090\nWhen you're out there at\npublic WiFi hotspots,\n\n365\n00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.880\nthis is really what you need to be doing.\n\n366\n00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.220\nIf you're gonna connect\nto another network,\n\n367\n00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.940\nyou should VPN to it because you're,\nagain, going over an open hotspot\n\n368\n00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.880\nthat anybody could be capturing those\npackets on if it's not protected.\n\n369\n00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:26.476\nYou could be, What's the word I'm looking\nfor there, giving up your information.\n\n370\n00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.629\nPeople could be getting your usernames,\npasswords,\n\n371\n00:20:28.629 --> 00:20:30.606\nall the data that you're sending back and\nforth.\n\n372\n00:20:30.606 --> 00:20:35.087\nIt's a fun thing to go sit at a coffee\nshop and fire up a packet sniffer and\n\n373\n00:20:35.087 --> 00:20:37.417\nsee what kind of traffic you can see.\n\n374\n00:20:37.417 --> 00:20:42.296\nIt is fun, probably I shouldn't say that,\nbut it can be entertaining.\n\n375\n00:20:42.296 --> 00:20:45.455\nLet's see, so yeah,\nwe talk about interconnected networks,\n\n376\n00:20:45.455 --> 00:20:47.310\nVPNs definitely should be used.\n\n377\n00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:52.067\nBut we need to, as Wes said,\nJust using a VPN is not enough.\n\n378\n00:20:52.067 --> 00:20:54.950\nYou gotta make sure that\nthe VPN is configured properly.\n\n379\n00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.585\nThere's protocols that have been\naround for a while like PPTP,\n\n380\n00:20:58.585 --> 00:21:00.954\nPoint-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.\n\n381\n00:21:00.954 --> 00:21:06.890\nThis is a older one that's basically\nencapsulating PPP packets or\n\n382\n00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.055\npoint-to-point packets.\n\n383\n00:21:10.055 --> 00:21:11.835\nBut it's older, and\n\n384\n00:21:11.835 --> 00:21:16.625\nthe problem with it is it has known\nvulnerabilities associated with it.\n\n385\n00:21:16.625 --> 00:21:20.034\nWhen you look at the encryption\nthat's being used with those.\n\n386\n00:21:20.034 --> 00:21:22.917\nMaybe we're using MS-CHAP v2.\n\n387\n00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:28.300\nWell, MS-CHAP v2 uses a weaker algorithm,\nand it has known vulnerabilities.\n\n388\n00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.100\nAnd if I can capture\nenough of those packets,\n\n389\n00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.460\nI can break that information and\nbreak the encryption.\n\n390\n00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.860\nSo just using a VPN is\nnot gonna be enough.\n\n391\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.055\nAnd I know on some older systems,\nit defaults to PPTP because it was\n\n392\n00:21:40.055 --> 00:21:42.694\na very common protocol that\nwas pretty much accepted.\n\n393\n00:21:42.694 --> 00:21:47.300\nMost servers that were VPN endpoints\nwould allow that protocol.\n\n394\n00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.119\nWe have much better protocols nowadays.\n\n395\n00:21:49.119 --> 00:21:50.369\nThey've been around a while too.\n\n396\n00:21:50.369 --> 00:21:55.430\nBut that's the thing, it's like, we have\nbetter stuff, why aren't we using it?\n\n397\n00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.480\nBackwards compatibility,\npeople are slow to update,\n\n398\n00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.629\nold systems that are in place that don't\nunderstand the newer technologies.\n\n399\n00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.138\nSo we should switch, we should switch to,\n\n400\n00:22:06.138 --> 00:22:10.690\nif you're gonna use MS-CHAP v2,\ndo a EAP MS-CHAP.\n\n401\n00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.911\nBecause MS-CHAP has an issue with the very\nfirst part of the authentication process.\n\n402\n00:22:15.911 --> 00:22:20.785\nWhereas EAP, good God,\nEncapsulating Authentication Protocol,\n\n403\n00:22:20.785 --> 00:22:22.370\nremember-\n&gt;&gt; Extensible.\n\n404\n00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.240\n&gt;&gt; Extensible Authentication Protocol,\nthank you, wraps up that very first part\n\n405\n00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.750\nof that authentication process in a much\nstronger algorithm to protect that.\n\n406\n00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.731\nOr EAP-TLS,\nusing transport layer security, or\n\n407\n00:22:34.731 --> 00:22:39.552\nI should say TLS MS-CHAP v2,\nto protect that information.\n\n408\n00:22:39.552 --> 00:22:42.641\nSo if you're gonna use one of these\nolder protocols, if you have to,\n\n409\n00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:44.360\nfigure out how you can strengthen it.\n\n410\n00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.930\nLook at its vulnerabilities,\nits weaknesses, and\n\n411\n00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.790\nimprove upon them if you can.\n\n412\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.921\nThe problem is those are bolt-on fixes,\nand they're never gonna be as good as\n\n413\n00:22:52.921 --> 00:22:56.249\nsomething that was designed with\nsecurity from the ground up.\n\n414\n00:22:56.249 --> 00:22:59.939\nAnd unfortunately, back when a lot\nof this stuff was developed,\n\n415\n00:22:59.939 --> 00:23:01.800\nsecurity was not a concern.\n\n416\n00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.820\nIt wasn't like it is today\nwhere everything is connected.\n\n417\n00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.172\nWhen some of the stuff was developed,\nit was still ARPANET and\n\n418\n00:23:09.172 --> 00:23:13.635\njust a few universities and military\norganizations that are involved with that.\n\n419\n00:23:13.635 --> 00:23:16.600\nSo definitely wanna get away from that.\n\n420\n00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:22.270\nWe should be switching to say L2TP,\nLayer 2 Tunneling Protocol with IPsec.\n\n421\n00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.230\nBe careful with that one.\n\n422\n00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.182\nL2TP doesn't have built-in encryption.\n\n423\n00:23:25.182 --> 00:23:27.426\nYou think, I'll just use L2TP,\nthat's a newer one.\n\n424\n00:23:27.426 --> 00:23:31.595\nDoesn't even have it built in,\nwe had to bring something else along,\n\n425\n00:23:31.595 --> 00:23:34.575\nwhich is why you almost\nalways see L2TP / IPsec.\n\n426\n00:23:34.575 --> 00:23:38.860\nBecause we know we need to encrypt and\nadd a payload in that information.\n\n427\n00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.315\nWhat else?\n\n428\n00:23:41.315 --> 00:23:46.430\nSSTP, Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol,\ngoes over common port 443,\n\n429\n00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.270\ntakes advantage of TLS\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n430\n00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:54.120\nAnd it's a much more secure protocol.\n\n431\n00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.836\n&gt;&gt; You know, one of the ones I think of,\ncuz we've been talking about wireless\n\n432\n00:23:56.836 --> 00:23:58.626\nnetworks and, is IKE out there,\nIKE version 2.\n\n433\n00:23:58.626 --> 00:24:00.477\nYou know,\nthe Internet Key Exchange version 2.\n\n434\n00:24:00.477 --> 00:24:03.470\nSome call it MOBIKE I think\ncuz of the mobility and\n\n435\n00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:08.216\nthe fact that when you're When your\nInternet connection isn't that great,\n\n436\n00:24:08.216 --> 00:24:12.100\nIKE version 2 can handle these\nshoddy wireless connections.\n\n437\n00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.180\nNow the other one Mike,\nanother topic that I think of is\n\n438\n00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.200\none that seems to get a lot of popularity\nwhen they're thinking more on maybe\n\n439\n00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.730\na country wide basis when we're thinking,\nwhat are the bad guys gonna take?\n\n440\n00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.110\nIf they can get access to anything\nwhat are they gonna take down?\n\n441\n00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.950\nAre they gonna shut down the entire\neastern seaboard's power grids or\n\n442\n00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:29.600\nsomething like that?\n\n443\n00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.630\nSo we have to worry about concepts\nlike that, as well, right?\n\n444\n00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:33.360\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n445\n00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:40.544\nThis is something that's a great fear for,\nas you said, typically countries.\n\n446\n00:24:40.544 --> 00:24:45.220\nAnd I think where you're heading with\nthis is our industrial control systems,\n\n447\n00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.490\nlike SCADA systems.\n\n448\n00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.170\nWhich is a I always have to look and\nmake sure I say this one right.\n\n449\n00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:54.460\nSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition,\nS-C-A-D-A, SCADA systems.\n\n450\n00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.893\nAnd when we look at industries\nlike power and water,\n\n451\n00:24:58.893 --> 00:25:03.649\nsewage, they're distributed\ncomputer facilities.\n\n452\n00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:05.036\nYou get these plants,\n\n453\n00:25:05.036 --> 00:25:10.150\nthese remote facilities that I need to be\nable to control from a central location.\n\n454\n00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.450\nAnd so, and not just there.\n\n455\n00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:17.110\nWe're looking at industrialized plants,\nautomotive manufacturers they use\n\n456\n00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:21.420\nindustrial control systems or\nICS as well to help automate those lines.\n\n457\n00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:26.176\nI was reading up on some of the ones\nused in the automobile industry and\n\n458\n00:25:26.176 --> 00:25:32.332\nback in the day, when they went from the\n2000 to 2001 model car it was a long time.\n\n459\n00:25:32.332 --> 00:25:36.898\nIt was a big process to switch that line\nover because all the assembly lines were\n\n460\n00:25:36.898 --> 00:25:40.151\ndone with older style mechanical\nswitches and drums and\n\n461\n00:25:40.151 --> 00:25:44.509\nthings like these that would automate\nthe movement of things to put this car\n\n462\n00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:47.290\ntogether as it travelled down the line.\n\n463\n00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:50.010\nNow it's all electronic driven or\n\n464\n00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:55.820\nit's being updated to be\nan industrial control system,\n\n465\n00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.970\nwhich makes it much faster,\nsay, to switch over the line.\n\n466\n00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:02.476\nBecause I can reconfigure it from\na graphical user interface, maybe, or\n\n467\n00:26:02.476 --> 00:26:03.865\nsomething like that.\n\n468\n00:26:03.865 --> 00:26:08.490\nBut when we look at SCADA systems,\nthese are a big target of attack.\n\n469\n00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:10.710\nThere's already been a few out there.\n\n470\n00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:15.780\nI'm sure we're familiar with the,\nwhat was it, the Iranian nuclear\n\n471\n00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:21.045\nfacilities where they had a malware\nintroduced into their systems.\n\n472\n00:26:21.045 --> 00:26:24.400\nCaused failures on some of their\ndevices in their nuclear facilities.\n\n473\n00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.390\nIt could have been a really\nhuge problem there.\n\n474\n00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:31.710\nIt was, I believe those were air\ngapped systems, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n475\n00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.180\nIf I remember right, they were air gapped.\n\n476\n00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.780\nMeaning, there is no\nconnection to the outside.\n\n477\n00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.940\nSo how did they compromise this system?\n\n478\n00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.530\nThumb drives, right?\n\n479\n00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:40.780\nYou just take thumb drives.\n\n480\n00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.500\nDo this sometime.\n\n481\n00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.060\nIf you're with your IT staff at your\norganization, set up a little test for\n\n482\n00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.450\nyour end users.\n\n483\n00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.700\nThere's great learning in this process.\n\n484\n00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.440\nYou should do this regularly.\n\n485\n00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.630\nYou should have exercises\nwith your end users.\n\n486\n00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.969\nGo out and buy ten cheapo thumb drives.\n\n487\n00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:01.910\nLoad up a little autorun web page\nthat says call your system admin and\n\n488\n00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.370\nthen scatter them around the parking lot,\nin the bathroom, the break area and\n\n489\n00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.164\nstuff like that and see how many of\nthem get plugged in your network.\n\n490\n00:27:08.164 --> 00:27:09.730\nYou'll be surprised.\n\n491\n00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:13.702\nRandom thumb drives that somebody found\nin the parking lot plugged into the work\n\n492\n00:27:13.702 --> 00:27:14.302\ncomputer.\n\n493\n00:27:14.302 --> 00:27:19.470\nIf I'm not mistaken this is how they got\nthat into the nuclear facility there.\n\n494\n00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:24.156\nIt was something very similar to that, and\nwe call it baiting, is the formal term for\n\n495\n00:27:24.156 --> 00:27:25.345\nthat type of attack.\n\n496\n00:27:25.345 --> 00:27:29.204\nUsed to be done, we'd take CD-ROMs and\nput XXX on there.\n\n497\n00:27:29.204 --> 00:27:32.880\nAnd somebody's gonna throw it in their\ncomputer to see what's on there.\n\n498\n00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:38.970\nNow you just do it on thumb drives and\nif people, I found a thumb drive, great.\n\n499\n00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.430\nNot only do I want the thumb drive,\n\n500\n00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:44.370\nbut hey there might be something cool on\nhere that I can make fun of somebody with.\n\n501\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.350\nOr maybe there's free music or\nmovies on there.\n\n502\n00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.940\nThey're gonna plug it in and unfortunately\nit's gonna be your work system.\n\n503\n00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.600\nBut getting back to SCADA,\nI do wanna mention a couple terms.\n\n504\n00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.140\nWe talked about industrial\ncontrol systems or ICSs.\n\n505\n00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.960\nThose are basically, SCADA is a form\nof industrial control system.\n\n506\n00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:06.600\nThose are made up of what they call\ndistributed control systems or DCSs and\n\n507\n00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.470\nprogrammable logic controllers or PLCs.\n\n508\n00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:14.430\nAnd this is where like I was\ntalking about on the assembly line.\n\n509\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:17.186\nThat's what's replacing those\nmechanical devices that were\n\n510\n00:28:17.186 --> 00:28:19.900\nrunning the line are these\nprogrammable logic controllers.\n\n511\n00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:24.410\nThese are the the small, I say smaller\ndevices, not necessarily small physically.\n\n512\n00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.730\nBut these are the ones that serve some\npurpose, the ones we're trying to control.\n\n513\n00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.540\nBut your industrial control systems\nare made up of those distributed control\n\n514\n00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:37.160\nsystems, PLCs, your programmable logic\ncontrollers, and then sensors, all right?\n\n515\n00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.790\nAll of this information is being fed\nback to this central control system, or\n\n516\n00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.320\ndistributed control system.\n\n517\n00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.520\nAnd then, from there,\nsending out commands back to these,\n\n518\n00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.630\nbased on the information\nreceived from the sensors.\n\n519\n00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:53.400\nSending information back to the PLCs\nto open a valve, raise a temperature,\n\n520\n00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.790\nstop a valve, right?\n\n521\n00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:58.120\nSo you imagine an industrial vat of liquid\n\n522\n00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.540\nthat's gonna have a couple\nsensors in there.\n\n523\n00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.680\nIt's gonna have a low level sensor and\na high level sensor.\n\n524\n00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:07.120\nAnd reading that information,\nif it gets too high, that PLC or\n\n525\n00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.620\nthat sensor sends that back to\nthe distributed control system.\n\n526\n00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:17.300\nWhich can then send back a command to\nthe PLC to slow that valve down or\n\n527\n00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.490\nclose it or turn it a little bit\nto shut it down or slow the flow.\n\n528\n00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.840\nIf it gets too low the reverse happens.\n\n529\n00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.424\nIt sends a signal,\nit sees that low sensor alarming, and\n\n530\n00:29:26.424 --> 00:29:28.974\nit sends back a signal to open the valve.\n\n531\n00:29:28.974 --> 00:29:35.658\nGreat, right, I mean fantastic,\ntechnology is amazing what it does for us.\n\n532\n00:29:35.658 --> 00:29:41.345\nBut we move towards functionality,\nwe move away from security.\n\n533\n00:29:41.345 --> 00:29:44.225\nAnd now we're introducing\na lot more avenues of attack.\n\n534\n00:29:44.225 --> 00:29:47.372\nAnd if somebody can get\naccess to that main system,\n\n535\n00:29:47.372 --> 00:29:50.522\nI can now have far-reaching\neffects on the entire operation.\n\n536\n00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:52.942\nI can close valves that should be open,\n\n537\n00:29:54.462 --> 00:29:57.982\nclose the cooling that should be coming\nin that's cooling everything down.\n\n538\n00:29:57.982 --> 00:30:03.192\nI think in Iran there was a speed sensor\nor something they did with the centrifuge\n\n539\n00:30:03.192 --> 00:30:07.729\nthat caused them to spin way past\ntheir normal rate and begin to fail.\n\n540\n00:30:07.729 --> 00:30:11.670\nThese are the kinds of things\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n541\n00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:18.264\nWhat if a bad guy gets access to,\nThe water facilities, and they\n\n542\n00:30:18.264 --> 00:30:24.304\ncan start dumping raw sewage back into\nthe fresh water supply that's coming out.\n\n543\n00:30:24.304 --> 00:30:28.136\nThey can start shutting down power\nin the middle of the winter,\n\n544\n00:30:28.136 --> 00:30:31.770\nIn the north where people will\ndie if they don't have heat.\n\n545\n00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.012\n&gt;&gt; You know, it's interesting,\n\n546\n00:30:33.012 --> 00:30:35.222\nyou're mentioning some of\nthese SCADA devices, Mike.\n\n547\n00:30:35.222 --> 00:30:38.713\nOne of the things that, it's not on\nthe exam, but I'm surprised it's not,\n\n548\n00:30:38.713 --> 00:30:39.316\nis the RTUs.\n\n549\n00:30:39.316 --> 00:30:42.343\nThe remote telemetry units or\nremote terminal units,\n\n550\n00:30:42.343 --> 00:30:44.590\ndepends on what acronym you like there.\n\n551\n00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.070\nBut they're sending back data as well,\n\n552\n00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.120\nlike hey what's the power\ngoing over this line?\n\n553\n00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.380\nAnd I can only imagine if you could do\nsome kinda man in the middle attack and\n\n554\n00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.030\nscrape that information it could use and\nlead you into something,\n\n555\n00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:58.210\nlike hey, now I know what I gotta do.\n\n556\n00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:03.305\nI know where the sensor\nsays the red line limit is.\n\n557\n00:31:03.305 --> 00:31:05.450\nBut if I get into the PLC,\nI can control that and\n\n558\n00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:08.273\nthen bring something down then\ncause all kinds of problems.\n\n559\n00:31:08.273 --> 00:31:09.408\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n560\n00:31:09.408 --> 00:31:12.894\nAnd I just a bought a book\nthat's hopefully coming in soon.\n\n561\n00:31:12.894 --> 00:31:14.890\nYou guys get my order here.\n\n562\n00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:18.594\nIt's all bout hacking automobiles.\n\n563\n00:31:18.594 --> 00:31:19.650\nThis is a new thing.\n\n564\n00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:23.380\nIt's being able to plug in, we've all seen\nthe insurance commercials where they got\n\n565\n00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.570\nthe little device they can plug in and\nsave you money on your insurance.\n\n566\n00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:30.630\nWell that's what it's doing is monitoring\nyour driving habits, looking at how hard\n\n567\n00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.820\nyou're braking, look at your average\nmiles per hours, things like that.\n\n568\n00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.120\nAnd this is directly\ntied in to the system.\n\n569\n00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:42.155\nThere's vulnerabilities in some of\nthe entertainment package, right?\n\n570\n00:31:42.155 --> 00:31:45.842\nI can get in my car,\nit automatically picks up my phone, so\n\n571\n00:31:45.842 --> 00:31:47.710\nI can make phone calls.\n\n572\n00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:52.280\nIt immediately fires up Pandora and starts\nplaying my music again all via Bluetooth.\n\n573\n00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.646\nGreat, love that functionality.\n\n574\n00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:58.511\nBut what if a malicious actor tries to\nconnect to my car via Bluetooth and\n\n575\n00:31:58.511 --> 00:32:03.023\nit's just saying, hello, would you like to\nconnect to me What if we can move beyond\n\n576\n00:32:03.023 --> 00:32:07.030\nthe entertainment system now and\nstart getting into the engine, right?\n\n577\n00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:09.600\nBecause all these engines are now\ncontrolled electronically.\n\n578\n00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.290\nAnd if I can increase, decrease fuel\nmixtures, do all kinds of things,\n\n579\n00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:18.620\nturn off, god forbid, like brakes,\nit's scary to think about.\n\n580\n00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.000\nSo, I don't know how I got off on that\ntopic, it is gonna be a cool book.\n\n581\n00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.292\nI can't wait to read it.\n\n582\n00:32:24.292 --> 00:32:25.787\nLet's take a look at my screen here,\n\n583\n00:32:25.787 --> 00:32:28.693\nI know I haven't really had a lot of\ndemos for this particular lecture.\n\n584\n00:32:28.693 --> 00:32:33.188\nIt's not a lot to show, but\nI did bring up just a generic drawing.\n\n585\n00:32:33.188 --> 00:32:36.804\nIt's from, this is Creative Commons,\nbut it's a SCADA system,\n\n586\n00:32:36.804 --> 00:32:38.990\njust to give you an idea.\n\n587\n00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.630\nAnd if we look here we've\ngot the SCADA system itself.\n\n588\n00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:46.368\nUp here, this is where I'm gonna\nmanage and administer the system.\n\n589\n00:32:46.368 --> 00:32:50.762\nYou've got a PLC, a programmable logic\ncontroller here, you got one here, and\n\n590\n00:32:50.762 --> 00:32:52.370\nthen you got sensors.\n\n591\n00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:56.971\nAnd I can see where this arrow is saying,\nokay, this sensor's gonna feed data back\n\n592\n00:32:56.971 --> 00:32:59.863\ninto this PLC,\nwhich is gonna feed back into SCADA,\n\n593\n00:32:59.863 --> 00:33:04.334\nwhich can read that information, send\na signal back based on that information,\n\n594\n00:33:04.334 --> 00:33:07.720\nwhich can go down and\nchange the position of a valve, right?\n\n595\n00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:13.214\nThat's what we're talking about, we\ntalk about these supervisory control and\n\n596\n00:33:13.214 --> 00:33:17.332\ndata acquisition systems, and\nit has been a couple years but\n\n597\n00:33:17.332 --> 00:33:21.046\nthe government did a survey\nacross here in the States,\n\n598\n00:33:21.046 --> 00:33:25.113\nand I don't know if this has changed or\nnot, it might have.\n\n599\n00:33:25.113 --> 00:33:27.760\nLike you said, this was a couple of years\nago when I was doing this research.\n\n600\n00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.400\nAll of our distributions for\nlike power and\n\n601\n00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.250\nwater fell under the Department of\nForestry, which I found interesting.\n\n602\n00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:41.274\nBut the sad fact was that\nthe majority of our systems were\n\n603\n00:33:41.274 --> 00:33:44.151\nfound to have vulnerabilities.\n\n604\n00:33:44.151 --> 00:33:49.419\nAnd these are networks that we really\ndon't want to have vulnerabilities and\n\n605\n00:33:49.419 --> 00:33:53.713\nwe don't want compromise when we\ntalk about power and water and\n\n606\n00:33:53.713 --> 00:33:57.865\ngas and waste and\nthose kinds of services that they provide.\n\n607\n00:33:57.865 --> 00:34:03.725\nSo, anyway, we talked about SCADA,\nwe understand what that is,\n\n608\n00:34:03.725 --> 00:34:08.810\nand the vulnerabilities there are the fact\nthat they used to be air gapped and\n\n609\n00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.620\nyou could only work with those\nsystems inside that network.\n\n610\n00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:16.630\nThe problem is now we're starting to\nopen that up over the last few years.\n\n611\n00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:21.473\nThe centralized management has become\nkey to remotely manage these different\n\n612\n00:34:21.473 --> 00:34:24.490\nfacilities as the computer\nsystems get better.\n\n613\n00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:27.880\nSo, we all of a sudden we start tying\nthem back in to the rest of the network.\n\n614\n00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:32.324\nAnd that, of course, opens up problems,\nbecause now I've got a,\n\n615\n00:34:32.324 --> 00:34:36.730\nif I can connect to it from my office and\nthe remote site is in another state,\n\n616\n00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:41.210\nwell, that means there's gotta be a way\nthe bad guys can potentially gain that\n\n617\n00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:45.560\nsame level of access, whether it's hacking\nthrough me and getting to it, finding some\n\n618\n00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.830\nalternate way to spoof my credentials and\nget into it, there's definitely a way.\n\n619\n00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:53.800\nSo it's like we took away this air gap\ndefense, which is not bulletproof, but\n\n620\n00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.290\nit made it a lot more difficult.\n\n621\n00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:58.500\nYou had to have physical access\nto get into those systems.\n\n622\n00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:59.630\nWell, now we're networking together and\n\n623\n00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:04.610\nthese weren't designed, when these systems\nwere built and designed they were designed\n\n624\n00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:07.870\naround the fact that tt's not\nconnected to anything else.\n\n625\n00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:12.123\nSo, I'm not that, not as worried\nabout that type of outside attack.\n\n626\n00:35:12.123 --> 00:35:14.903\nAnd then all of a sudden we say,\nwell, for convenience sake,\n\n627\n00:35:14.903 --> 00:35:17.460\nwe're gonna tie them in together, great.\n\n628\n00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.480\nWhat about the security?\n\n629\n00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.660\nYeah, we didn't think about that.\n\n630\n00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.510\nNow, we've got to bolt on\npieces after the fact,\n\n631\n00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:29.140\nwhich I guess I've said before,\nis never going to be as good.\n\n632\n00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.220\nOne last thing I do wanna show you.\n\n633\n00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.899\nI know Wes is giving me that eye,\nwe're about out of time here.\n\n634\n00:35:32.899 --> 00:35:35.660\nI mentioned this earlier,\nI know I didn't close it, didn't I?\n\n635\n00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.443\nThere we go.\n\n636\n00:35:36.443 --> 00:35:40.137\nIf you wanna do some really great reading\non everything related to security, but\n\n637\n00:35:40.137 --> 00:35:44.430\nthose cases I was mentioning earlier, Home\nDepot, Target, Sony, things like that.\n\n638\n00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:48.249\nGo check out the SANS Reading Room,\nfreely available,\n\n639\n00:35:48.249 --> 00:35:52.717\nthousands of papers in here that\nyou can read up on, do a search for\n\n640\n00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:57.697\ncase studies and you can find those\narticles I was referring to earlier.\n\n641\n00:35:57.697 --> 00:35:59.893\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike,\nthat's a lot of great information but\n\n642\n00:35:59.893 --> 00:36:02.510\nit does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n643\n00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.761\nBut when it comes to some of the common\nvulnerabilities that we've looked at,\n\n644\n00:36:05.761 --> 00:36:06.893\nMike, before we sign off,\n\n645\n00:36:06.893 --> 00:36:09.820\nyou got any additional words you\nmight like to impart to our audience?\n\n646\n00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.680\n&gt;&gt; Don't get depressed.\n\n647\n00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.010\nI know when I first started switching\nfrom the Microsoft world into the world\n\n648\n00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:20.250\nof security, I thought I had\na pretty good handle on it.\n\n649\n00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:24.250\nAnd then I realized, wow,\nI got my work cut out for\n\n650\n00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.590\nme here,\nif I'm gonna try to secure this network.\n\n651\n00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:30.091\nWe started listing all the\nvulnerabilities, and it becomes tough as\n\n652\n00:36:30.091 --> 00:36:33.665\na system admin because as a bad actor\nI've got to get good at one thing.\n\n653\n00:36:33.665 --> 00:36:36.885\nI'm gonna pick my favorite method\nof attack, my attack vector, and\n\n654\n00:36:36.885 --> 00:36:38.060\nI'm gonna work on that.\n\n655\n00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.899\nAnd I'm gonna bounce around from\ntarget to target until I find somebody\n\n656\n00:36:40.899 --> 00:36:42.460\nthat's susceptible to that.\n\n657\n00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:47.249\nI've got it a lot easier than the system\nadmin that has to protect one network from\n\n658\n00:36:47.249 --> 00:36:49.091\nevery type of attack, right?\n\n659\n00:36:49.091 --> 00:36:53.144\nSo, don't get depressed,\ndon't get frustrated.\n\n660\n00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:54.750\nYou just have to do it one step at a time.\n\n661\n00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:58.030\nDo your vulnerability scans,\ntake those results,\n\n662\n00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:02.100\nprioritize, identify your critical\nsystems, your non-critical systems.\n\n663\n00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.010\nIdentify the vulnerabilities\nwith the biggest impact.\n\n664\n00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:08.210\nDo you risk analysis on those?\n\n665\n00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:12.460\nAnd work your way down, start with those,\none thing at a time, and\n\n666\n00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.590\njust work your way down, and\nyou will be able to secure your network.\n\n667\n00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike,\nthat's a lot of great information.\n\n668\n00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.590\nAnd I think I'm gonna extend\nmy tinfoil hat now to my car,\n\n669\n00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.520\nput a tempest shield in\nbefore that book arrives.\n\n670\n00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.490\nThank you for the carrier for\n\n671\n00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.290\nthe delay, it does give me a little\nchance to install it beforehand.\n\n672\n00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:30.065\nBut signing out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n673\n00:37:30.065 --> 00:37:30.972\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n674\n00:37:30.972 --> 00:37:33.713\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n675\n00:37:33.713 --> 00:37:39.772\n[MUSIC]\n\n676\n00:37:39.772 --> 00:37:45.359\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

--> 00:00:37.409\nwe wanna take a look at what we\ncall incident impact, right.\n\n16\n00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:43.002\nAnd I wanna go over things\nlike threat classification.\n\n17\n00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:46.620\nSome of the things that\ncontribute to incident severity.\n\n18\n00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.047\nAnd talk about prioritizing when we\nlook at responding to incidents.\n\n19\n00:00:51.047 --> 00:00:54.470\nSo let's start with talking\nabout threat classifications.\n\n20\n00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.035\nWe can roughly kind of divide threats\ninto at least two classifications.\n\n21\n00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:01.745\nI know they're different\ndepending on who you talk to.\n\n22\n00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:05.005\nThere's many different\nclassifications we can use.\n\n23\n00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:07.465\nBut in this scenario and for this exam,\n\n24\n00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:13.255\nI want to talk about known versus\nunknown and zero-day attacks, right.\n\n25\n00:01:13.255 --> 00:01:15.795\nAnd it's an interesting\nconcept when you look at\n\n26\n00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:18.245\nknown versus unknown, first of all.\n\n27\n00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:23.470\nBecause if you really stop and think about\nit, known versus unknown has nothing to\n\n28\n00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.260\ndo with the object itself,\nright, with the vulnerability.\n\n29\n00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.250\nWith the exploit, I should say.\n\n30\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.980\nIt doesn't know whether it's known or\nunknown.\n\n31\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.202\nIt's the examiner that either knows\nabout it or doesn't know about it.\n\n32\n00:01:36.202 --> 00:01:40.540\nOr it's the vulnerability scanner that\nknows about it or doesn't know about it.\n\n33\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.409\nIt's not the object itself.\n\n34\n00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.560\nWhich I always thought was interesting.\n\n35\n00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.210\nBut they're either known or\nunknown, but it's very subjective.\n\n36\n00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.180\nIt depends on your point of view, right.\n\n37\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.350\nEverything starts out as unknown.\n\n38\n00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.500\nIt has to be discovered by someone or\nsomething.\n\n39\n00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.340\nSome algorithm is doing research, or\nsome human that's doing research,\n\n40\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.410\ndiscovers this new exploit\nthat's being used.\n\n41\n00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.872\nWell, before that person did that,\nit was unknown.\n\n42\n00:02:05.872 --> 00:02:10.140\nAnd now it's known, but only known by\nthat one person and that one system.\n\n43\n00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.720\nAnd that is gonna slowly propagate to\nmore and more systems and information.\n\n44\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.070\nThat fact that it's known, right.\n\n45\n00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.950\nOnce, say, one of those big\ncompanies gets ahold of it\n\n46\n00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.190\nthey can maybe write some patch or\nsome way to protect against it.\n\n47\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.030\nIt becomes known to them, they patch\nsystems, now the systems know about it.\n\n48\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.200\nOr with the case of a virus or a worm,\n\n49\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.240\nonce your antivirus vendors write\ndefinitions for it, it's now known.\n\n50\n00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.250\nAnd so we can try to protect\nour systems from that.\n\n51\n00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.740\nBut everything really\nstarted out as unknown.\n\n52\n00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.850\n&gt;&gt; Mike, is this something that we can see\nin things like those threat analysis maps?\n\n53\n00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.530\nI know Intel/McAfee has\nthem from time to time.\n\n54\n00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.340\nThey find them, right?\n\n55\n00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.180\nAnd they'll show you a map of the world,\nand almost like a heat map, right?\n\n56\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.110\nAnd you can see areas of the world\nwhere they know about it,\n\n57\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.030\nbut maybe I'm in an area of the world\nthat they don't know about it.\n\n58\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.970\nSo to me, it's still unknown, where to you\nand your company, maybe in that red zone,\n\n59\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.640\nhopefully not [LAUGH],\nknow about that already.\n\n60\n00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI can see you looking at it that way.\n\n61\n00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.132\nReally, if the heat map, whatever\nyou're using for that knows about it,\n\n62\n00:03:08.132 --> 00:03:09.097\nthen it's It's known.\n\n63\n00:03:09.097 --> 00:03:12.010\nIt might not be known by you,\nbut it's known to somebody, so\n\n64\n00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.280\nit's considered known.\n\n65\n00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.180\nIt's just that you haven't\ngained the knowledge yet,\n\n66\n00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.530\nI guess is a way to look at it.\n\n67\n00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.462\nBut yeah, absolutely.\n\n68\n00:03:18.462 --> 00:03:20.680\nSo, and\nI always just thought that was funny.\n\n69\n00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.000\nBut anyway, so everything starts\nout as known, very subjective.\n\n70\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.320\nBecomes known.\n\n71\n00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.300\nNowadays we look at trying to, a lot of\nsoftware vendors out there are claiming\n\n72\n00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:37.110\nthat their software or their devices can\nprotect you against unknown attacks.\n\n73\n00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.260\nHow the heck are you gonna do that?\n\n74\n00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.030\nYou don't know about it,\nhow are you gonna detect it?\n\n75\n00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.913\nDynamic analysis, they've got algorithms\nthat can examine payloads and look for\n\n76\n00:03:45.913 --> 00:03:49.972\nwhat could potentially be malicious\nbehavior, it's pretty neat.\n\n77\n00:03:49.972 --> 00:03:53.475\nSo they really can help protect\nagainst unknown attacks.\n\n78\n00:03:53.475 --> 00:03:57.076\nThat's another one, when you first think\nabout it, it's like, how can you possibly\n\n79\n00:03:57.076 --> 00:03:59.754\nsell me something that's gonna\nprotect me from unknown stuff?\n\n80\n00:03:59.754 --> 00:04:03.095\nWell, there's incredible\nalgorithms they use.\n\n81\n00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:06.500\nDoing dynamic analysis,\ndoing static analysis.\n\n82\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.780\nThey can actually attempt,\nthey're not gonna stop everything,\n\n83\n00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.240\nbut they can definitely cut down\non the number of unknown or\n\n84\n00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.430\nwhat we might call zero-day attacks.\n\n85\n00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.770\nMike, I wonder if this\nfalls in line with that.\n\n86\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.890\nI've seen like for instance the Windows\nDefender platform that's inside of your\n\n87\n00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.340\nWindows operating systems today.\n\n88\n00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.571\nThey have things like sample submissions,\nand\n\n89\n00:04:26.571 --> 00:04:29.805\nyou can combine that with things\nlike the cloud-based solutions and\n\n90\n00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:33.162\nstuff where maybe another company\nhas already kinda learned about it.\n\n91\n00:04:33.162 --> 00:04:36.490\nAnd it's, like you said, it's dynamic.\n\n92\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.424\nIt's the fact that we can\nconstantly check these avenues and\n\n93\n00:04:39.424 --> 00:04:41.599\nsee if they're updating in real time.\n\n94\n00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:42.409\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n95\n00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.670\nWhen I was at the, you go to some of these\nsecurity conferences and things like that.\n\n96\n00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.668\nYou see some of the products\nthat are getting rolled out.\n\n97\n00:04:48.668 --> 00:04:50.746\nAnd they're just amazing\nat what they can do.\n\n98\n00:04:50.746 --> 00:04:53.170\nThey just get better and\nbetter every year.\n\n99\n00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.685\nThe cloud has definitely\nchanged a lot of things.\n\n100\n00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:59.020\nA lot of our antivirus solutions,\nas you were saying, is now cloud-based.\n\n101\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.666\nIt's a service that we subscribe to.\n\n102\n00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:05.004\nI was looking at some software that's\nsupposed to protect from ransomware, and\n\n103\n00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:07.320\nI think, wow,\nthat's going to be difficult, right?\n\n104\n00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.995\nAnd it's not that it can really stop\nit completely, but they do backups,\n\n105\n00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:13.603\nseveral backups, and\nthey compare backup states,\n\n106\n00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:16.171\nand they're looking at the metadata,\nthe files.\n\n107\n00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:19.394\nAnd they can detect immediately\nwhen something is changed, and\n\n108\n00:05:19.394 --> 00:05:21.542\nat least get that system\noff the network and\n\n109\n00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:24.760\nmaybe prevent that ransomware\nfrom spreading out.\n\n110\n00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.750\n&gt;&gt; Mike, you mentioned a term here,\nand help me out with it.\n\n111\n00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.440\nYou mentioned zero day,\nwhat does zero day really mean?\n\n112\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.060\nFor our viewers out there,\nI'm kinda wondering.\n\n113\n00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.950\n&gt;&gt; It's what we call an undisclosed avenue\nof attack or an undisclosed vulnerability.\n\n114\n00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.610\nAnd if you are unfortunate enough\nto be the first one that this,\n\n115\n00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.070\nlet's say I write some malware,\nand I release that out there.\n\n116\n00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.430\nIt's unknown, right?\n\n117\n00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.462\nNobody knows about it yet.\n\n118\n00:05:52.462 --> 00:05:54.299\nAnd if you are my first target,\n\n119\n00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:58.760\nyou are going to be the victim of\nwhat's called a zero-day attack.\n\n120\n00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.030\nBecause you're getting attacked by\nsomething that nobody has ever seen.\n\n121\n00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.050\nAnd what these bad actors are doing is,\nthat's what they're trying to do,\n\n122\n00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.550\nthey want to write unknown exploits.\n\n123\n00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.370\nThey don't want known exploits,\nbecause they're gonna get caught.\n\n124\n00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.750\nThe attack is not gonna work nearly\nas well, because it's known.\n\n125\n00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.260\nThere's software that can stop them.\n\n126\n00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.240\nSo how does one bad actor,\nif you were, go about creating\n\n127\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.540\nan unknown vulnerability that's capable\nof launching a zero-day attack?\n\n128\n00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.080\nYou run your own malware through those\nengines, and see if they light up.\n\n129\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.514\nAnd if they don't, now you know you've\ngot something that they don't know about,\n\n130\n00:06:39.514 --> 00:06:42.709\nthat even their dynamic analysis\nmaybe does not detect yet.\n\n131\n00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:46.924\nAnd you've, if I can say this,\nas a bad actor, you've done a good job,\n\n132\n00:06:46.924 --> 00:06:49.540\nbecause you've written something now.\n\n133\n00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.370\nBut they do, they test their own stuff\nagainst these different engines to try and\n\n134\n00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.034\ncome up with a way to slip this malware\nin without being detected, and without\n\n135\n00:06:59.034 --> 00:07:02.990\nsetting off all the IDSs and without\nsetting off your antivirus solutions and\n\n136\n00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.840\nyour alarms and things like that.\n\n137\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.060\nThat's their goal.\n\n138\n00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.020\n&gt;&gt; And Mike, we're not always dealing\nwith things like script kiddies, right?\n\n139\n00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.580\nJust little programs somebody else\nwrote out there, very easy to detect.\n\n140\n00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.040\nSometimes, I mean, these hackers,\nthey really know what they're doing.\n\n141\n00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.399\nWhen we have things that go beyond just\nthe, I can identify it quickly and\n\n142\n00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:20.441\neasily, right.\n\n143\n00:07:20.441 --> 00:07:21.072\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n144\n00:07:21.072 --> 00:07:25.532\nAnd one more thing before we can move on\nfrom zero day, I wanted to mention too,\n\n145\n00:07:25.532 --> 00:07:27.572\nactive before publicly reported.\n\n146\n00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:30.890\nAnd there's kind of a weird\nlittle catch with that one.\n\n147\n00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.370\nBecause if it hasn't\nbeen publicly reported,\n\n148\n00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.170\ndoesn't mean that somebody\ndoesn't know about it.\n\n149\n00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.110\nSo a zero-day doesn't necessarily\nhave to be unknown, right?\n\n150\n00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:46.685\nIf a vendor finds a vulnerability in their\nsoftware or whatever the product is.\n\n151\n00:07:46.685 --> 00:07:51.108\nThey’re going to try to create a patch for\nit so that they can release that.\n\n152\n00:07:51.108 --> 00:07:53.938\nAnd their idea is that We're not gonna\n\n153\n00:07:53.938 --> 00:07:58.189\nrelease information about\nwhat this vulnerability is.\n\n154\n00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:01.439\nWe're gonna give ourselves some\ntime to create a fix for it,\n\n155\n00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.360\nbefore we tell everybody about it.\n\n156\n00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.690\nThat way we can say, hey look,\nhere's the problem, here's the patch.\n\n157\n00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.630\nSo as soon as you know about it,\nthere's a patch available for it, and\n\n158\n00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.590\nyou can protect your system.\n\n159\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.640\nCuz if I come out and say,\nhey here's the problem we have,\n\n160\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.396\nwe don't have a patch for it yet.\n\n161\n00:08:15.396 --> 00:08:18.840\nWell the bad actors are gonna be\non those same bug tracked threads.\n\n162\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.300\nThey're gonna see that vulnerability.\n\n163\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.460\nThey're gonna write exploits for\n\n164\n00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.870\nit to take advantage of it before\nthey get the patch out, right?\n\n165\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.660\nSo that's the cat and mouse game\nthat the vendors will try to play.\n\n166\n00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.418\nSo I just want you to understand too,\nzero day means it's active before\n\n167\n00:08:32.418 --> 00:08:36.078\nit's publicly reported,\nnot necessarily unknown.\n\n168\n00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:41.580\nAll right and then to your point, Wes,\nyes, one of the things that we see now.\n\n169\n00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.200\nAnd I think we've mentioned\nthis in a previous episode.\n\n170\n00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.440\nIs something known as\nadvanced persistent threat.\n\n171\n00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:53.630\nThis is becoming a more common attack\nmethodology that we're seeing.\n\n172\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.070\nIt's no longer just a smash and grab.\n\n173\n00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.120\nBy the time you've realized,\nonce you've realized you've had a breach.\n\n174\n00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.757\nYou go and start doing your research and\n\n175\n00:09:02.757 --> 00:09:05.198\nyou find out the breach actually\noccurred six months ago.\n\n176\n00:09:05.198 --> 00:09:08.475\nAnd that they've been in your system and\ndoing gosh knows what and\n\n177\n00:09:08.475 --> 00:09:10.025\ngot access to who knows what for\n\n178\n00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:13.600\nthe last six months before you\nfinally detected their activity.\n\n179\n00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.486\nThis is what we call\nan advanced persistent threat.\n\n180\n00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:21.222\nAnd it is basically that the bad\nactors are picking a specific target\n\n181\n00:09:21.222 --> 00:09:25.890\nthat they want to compromise or\ninformation that they want to get.\n\n182\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.934\nThey are not just going in and\nseeing what's quickly available,\n\n183\n00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:31.930\neasily accessible and going for\nthe low hanging fruit.\n\n184\n00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.470\nThey're like, we know we can get\ninto your organizations network.\n\n185\n00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.540\nWe're already in.\n\n186\n00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.850\nWe've got our back door setup.\n\n187\n00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.010\nWe're hidden, we've got accounts\ncreated that we can use.\n\n188\n00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.340\nNow we just gotta figure out how we can\nescalate these accounts to get access to\n\n189\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.230\nthe data we need.\n\n190\n00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.710\nOr wait for somebody to move that\ndata across the network so we can or\n\n191\n00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.470\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n192\n00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.622\nThey're just sitting there and they're\ncontinuously monitoring and looking and\n\n193\n00:09:54.622 --> 00:09:58.700\nseeing what they can get and\nthese are typically highly trained people.\n\n194\n00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.973\nIn fact, a lot of this is state sponsored\nwhen you look at advance persistent threat\n\n195\n00:10:02.973 --> 00:10:05.855\nbecause it takes almost\na management team to manage it.\n\n196\n00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:09.584\nYou've got a lot of different moving\nparts and trying to remain undetected and\n\n197\n00:10:09.584 --> 00:10:10.670\nkeep the access open.\n\n198\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:17.050\nThere are occurences, I've read\nabout these where there was a whole\n\n199\n00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:21.790\nteam of people involved that had\nmanagement, and they had schedules\n\n200\n00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.150\nof when they needed to be available\nto do their part in this attack.\n\n201\n00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.660\nTo keep that access open while they\nwere gathering this information and\n\n202\n00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.670\nexfiltrating data.\n\n203\n00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.100\nSo they're what they call task-specific.\n\n204\n00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.490\nThey're not as much opportunistic.\n\n205\n00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.690\nThey're going for a specific thing\nthat they wanna get access to.\n\n206\n00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.480\nVery difficult to identify,\nbecause they're in.\n\n207\n00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.034\nAnd they're not setting off alarms,\nlike you were mentioning, script kiddies,\n\n208\n00:10:47.034 --> 00:10:49.831\nwhich is a slang term for\nan inexperienced hacker,\n\n209\n00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:54.079\nthat might just be using tools that\nhe's found and doesn't know a lot about.\n\n210\n00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:57.398\nAnd can end up making a lot of noise and\nsetting off a lot of alarms.\n\n211\n00:10:57.398 --> 00:10:59.430\nAnd it's typically easy detectable.\n\n212\n00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:04.584\nYou know, the ones that are performing the\nadvanced persistent threats are typically\n\n213\n00:11:04.584 --> 00:11:09.608\nhighly trained, highly skilled teams of,\nif you want to call them professionals.\n\n214\n00:11:09.608 --> 00:11:11.450\nBecause they're making money usually,\nat this.\n\n215\n00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.900\nThat are doing these attacks.\n\n216\n00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.900\nAnd really, like I said,\nthey're very difficult to detect.\n\n217\n00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.830\nUsually when they're detected it's\nbecause we've noticed a large amount or\n\n218\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.570\nan anomaly in data leaving the network.\n\n219\n00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.610\nWe normally have, I don't know, one,\n\n220\n00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.670\ntwo gigs of data going out a day and\nall of the sudden there's a terabyte.\n\n221\n00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:32.701\nThat would be an anomaly.\n\n222\n00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:35.710\nThere's a large spike in the amount\nof data that's going out.\n\n223\n00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.032\nBut the problem is they're good,\nand they know that too.\n\n224\n00:11:38.032 --> 00:11:42.422\nAnd they're not going to grab everything\nyou've got at once and try to get it out.\n\n225\n00:11:42.422 --> 00:11:44.010\nThey're gonna go little by little.\n\n226\n00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.324\nAnd again,\ntry to avoid setting off any alarms.\n\n227\n00:11:47.324 --> 00:11:50.730\nTry to avoid you noticing\nwhat's going on there.\n\n228\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.600\nSo, but be familiar with that term.\n\n229\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:58.240\nAdvanced persistent threat Is a way to\ndescribe an attack that's a long and\n\n230\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:58.780\nongoing.\n\n231\n00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.030\nIt's like the long hunt where you're not\njust trying to con somebody into giving\n\n232\n00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:10.560\nyou something right now, you're gonna set\nthem up for a much larger con over time.\n\n233\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.400\nSo it's the same kind of concept there.\n\n234\n00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.095\nSo threat classification again known and\n\n235\n00:12:17.095 --> 00:12:21.395\nunknown zero day advanced persistence\nthreat view of the terms and\n\n236\n00:12:21.395 --> 00:12:26.610\nconcepts we need to be familiar with for\nour cyber security analyst plus.\n\n237\n00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:31.759\nNow factors contributing to incident\nseverity and prioritization when we\n\n238\n00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:36.915\nlook at incidents and we try to decide\nhow we're going to respond to these.\n\n239\n00:12:36.915 --> 00:12:42.590\nOne of the things we do is we do we do,\nwe try to classify.\n\n240\n00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.024\nWe try to look at the severity level and\nwe prioritize,\n\n241\n00:12:46.024 --> 00:12:49.471\nespecially if there's more\nthan one attack going on.\n\n242\n00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:52.334\nAnd it's unfortunately becoming more and\nmore common.\n\n243\n00:12:52.334 --> 00:12:57.404\nThere are many reported instances\nof companies being victim of say\n\n244\n00:12:57.404 --> 00:13:02.577\nransomware twice in one day,\nwhich is kind of crazy to think about.\n\n245\n00:13:02.577 --> 00:13:09.285\nBut yeah, we try to prioritized this so we\ncan handle it in the appropriate fashion.\n\n246\n00:13:09.285 --> 00:13:12.410\nI mean if Wes' laptop gets compromised,\nright?\n\n247\n00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.341\nThat's a problem we've got to figure\nout what that avenue of attack was,\n\n248\n00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:16.434\nhow they get compromised?\n\n249\n00:13:16.434 --> 00:13:19.227\nI got to make sure I get that any data\nthat I might be on there find out if\n\n250\n00:13:19.227 --> 00:13:20.540\nit's been compromised.\n\n251\n00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.400\nGot to get Wes back to\nwork on a clean system.\n\n252\n00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.050\nSo that's important.\n\n253\n00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:29.290\nBut it's not as important as\nif I think they got into my\n\n254\n00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.600\nSQL database that has all my customer\ninformation and credit card information.\n\n255\n00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.676\nThat would take a much higher\npriority over Wes' laptop all right,\n\n256\n00:13:37.676 --> 00:13:40.090\nso we wanna prioritize things.\n\n257\n00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.440\nAnd how we do that is one we\nlook at the scope of the impact.\n\n258\n00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.520\nDid it just affect Wes' laptop?\n\n259\n00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.235\nAnd we were able to isolate, or\nhas it spread across all the client\n\n260\n00:13:50.235 --> 00:13:54.973\nmachines on my network, or\nis it reaching into my server subnet?\n\n261\n00:13:54.973 --> 00:13:58.360\nIs it propagating currently,\nwhat is the scope?\n\n262\n00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.090\nWhat did it affect?\n\n263\n00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.892\nIt's gonna help me to determine what my\nseverity and prioritization should be.\n\n264\n00:14:03.892 --> 00:14:06.450\nWe also have to think about\nthe functional impact.\n\n265\n00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.834\nIs it something where, you know,\n\n266\n00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:13.860\nlet's say the access to the website\nis slow, but it's still possible.\n\n267\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.944\nOr has it completely shut off\nmy website from the outside and\n\n268\n00:14:18.944 --> 00:14:21.857\nno body can get to my website and\nmy product.\n\n269\n00:14:21.857 --> 00:14:26.685\nIf part of my, let's say my cluster, if\nsome of my nodes in my cluster have gone\n\n270\n00:14:26.685 --> 00:14:31.720\ndown but the other, there's still some\nsurviving nodes and they're okay.\n\n271\n00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.680\nThey just can't handle the same workload.\n\n272\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.270\nThat's one thing.\n\n273\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.470\nIf everybody in the cluster has gone down,\nthat's a different priority, right?\n\n274\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.110\nThat's a different severity level.\n\n275\n00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.210\nSo looking at the functional impact.\n\n276\n00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.209\nHas it shut the business\ndown completely or\n\n277\n00:14:44.209 --> 00:14:47.217\nare we still able to limp along and\nmake do.\n\n278\n00:14:47.217 --> 00:14:50.930\nOr is it barely affecting as we just\nhave to make sure we contain it?\n\n279\n00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.170\nWhat is this, the functional impact?\n\n280\n00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:57.240\nThe information impact,\nwhat did they get access to?\n\n281\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:02.080\nDid they get access to where\nI keep my show notes, right?\n\n282\n00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.118\nWhich is not that big of a deal.\n\n283\n00:15:04.118 --> 00:15:05.850\nIf you want my show notes,\nI'll give them to you.\n\n284\n00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:10.104\nOr did they get access to all of our\ncustomer information, that personally\n\n285\n00:15:10.104 --> 00:15:14.034\nidentifiable information that we\ncan be liable for if that gets out.\n\n286\n00:15:14.034 --> 00:15:20.120\nWhat is the impact on the information\nthat could be part of the breach?\n\n287\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.770\nRecoverability, if it's again my laptop,\nWes' laptop, we wipe it,\n\n288\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.180\nwe reimage it,\nit's gonna be done in less than an hour.\n\n289\n00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.420\nIf it's all of the nodes across my\nnetwork, that's a little different story.\n\n290\n00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.310\nIt's gonna take me a little\nlonger to recover.\n\n291\n00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.805\nIf we don't have any idea where\nthe breach occurred, how they got in,\n\n292\n00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:42.944\nI don't know whether everything\nis clean yet or we stopped it,\n\n293\n00:15:42.944 --> 00:15:44.856\nit's gonna take a little bit longer.\n\n294\n00:15:44.856 --> 00:15:48.801\nAre we gonna have to do\nin incident response and\n\n295\n00:15:48.801 --> 00:15:53.354\ndo an investigation That's\ngonna take even longer so\n\n296\n00:15:53.354 --> 00:15:58.223\ntry to determine how long it's\ngonna take us to recover.\n\n297\n00:15:58.223 --> 00:16:02.590\nA really good document and you'll never\nguess where I found this one, NIST,\n\n298\n00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.850\nof course.\n\n299\n00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.140\nI go back and forth between NIST and SANS.\n\n300\n00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.000\nLots of great information\nthey make available for us.\n\n301\n00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.009\nComputer Security Incident Handling Guide\nhas some great recommendations in here.\n\n302\n00:16:14.009 --> 00:16:15.773\nI'm not gonna go through the whole thing,\n\n303\n00:16:15.773 --> 00:16:17.635\ndefinitely one worth\ngetting your hands on.\n\n304\n00:16:17.635 --> 00:16:22.915\nFreely available, again, this is\nthe NIST special publication 800- 61.\n\n305\n00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:26.094\nIt's actually under Revision 2, currently.\n\n306\n00:16:26.094 --> 00:16:31.017\nAnd let me jump down to here, cuz what\nI wanted to show out of this document\n\n307\n00:16:31.017 --> 00:16:35.300\nwas some of their classifications\nthat they recommend.\n\n308\n00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.632\nFunctional impact categories, here.\n\n309\n00:16:38.632 --> 00:16:40.044\nNone, low, medium, high,\n\n310\n00:16:40.044 --> 00:16:43.770\nno effect on the organization's\nability to provide services.\n\n311\n00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:47.110\nMinimal effect,\nthey can still provide critical services.\n\n312\n00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.585\nBut they've lost efficiency, like I was\nsaying, things maybe have slowed down but\n\n313\n00:16:51.585 --> 00:16:52.668\nwe're still okay.\n\n314\n00:16:52.668 --> 00:16:56.374\nMedium, has lost the ability to provide\na critical service or a subset,\n\n315\n00:16:56.374 --> 00:16:58.480\nto a subset of system users.\n\n316\n00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.240\nOr high, no longer able to provide, right?\n\n317\n00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.310\nAnd this is not a set-in-stone\nthing that everybody has to use.\n\n318\n00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.950\nSo just a set of guidelines that they say,\nhey, if you don't have an idea or\n\n319\n00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:12.800\nyou want some help in defining\nyour categories, here you go.\n\n320\n00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.860\nInformation impact categories,\nI want to start down at none.\n\n321\n00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.900\nNo information was\nremoved from the network.\n\n322\n00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:23.401\nOr it's a privacy breach,\nwe had PII involved.\n\n323\n00:17:23.401 --> 00:17:25.770\nAnd my machine is locked up, there we go.\n\n324\n00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.930\nA proprietary breach,\nunclassified proprietary information, or\n\n325\n00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:30.840\nintegrity loss.\n\n326\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.820\nSensitive or proprietary information\nwas changed or deleted, right?\n\n327\n00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.600\nSo different ways to classify\nyour information impact.\n\n328\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.152\nRecoverability efforts, regular,\n\n329\n00:17:40.152 --> 00:17:42.762\ntime to recover is predictable\nwith existing resources.\n\n330\n00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:47.020\nSupplemented, time to recovery's\npredictable with additional resources.\n\n331\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.410\nExtended, it's unpredictable.\n\n332\n00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.990\nI've gotta go out and\nget some outside help.\n\n333\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.820\nI don't know how long this is gonna take.\n\n334\n00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:54.550\nWe're gonna call them.\n\n335\n00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.450\nHopefully they're not busy and\nthey can get over here in the next hour.\n\n336\n00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.160\nBut it might be tomorrow\nbefore they can make it out.\n\n337\n00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.480\nNot Recoverable, right,\nthat just means it's burned to the ground,\n\n338\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.970\nso to speak, and\nwe've got to launch our investigation.\n\n339\n00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.990\nData's already been exfiltrated and\nit's posted.\n\n340\n00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.070\nAt that point,\nif you've had information stolen and\n\n341\n00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.570\nthat stuff has already been posted out\nthere and made available to the public or\n\n342\n00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.370\nto whomever to your competitors or\nwhatever,\n\n343\n00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.980\nthe change is the way I'm gonna go about,\nhandling the incident.\n\n344\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.705\nBecause the information is already leaked,\nso I need to stop the incident.\n\n345\n00:18:33.705 --> 00:18:36.972\nAnd I want to make sure no other\ninformation is leaked, but\n\n346\n00:18:36.972 --> 00:18:41.109\nthat particular set of data has already\nbeen compromised at that point and\n\n347\n00:18:41.109 --> 00:18:43.057\nthere's no way to take that back.\n\n348\n00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:44.905\nSo some good information there.\n\n349\n00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:46.462\nAgain, that's from NIST.\n\n350\n00:18:46.462 --> 00:18:50.071\nThat's their SP800-61.\n\n351\n00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:51.975\nAll right, let's see what else.\n\n352\n00:18:51.975 --> 00:18:54.283\nAnd we kinda already hit some\nof these points as well, but\n\n353\n00:18:54.283 --> 00:18:55.399\nwe'll go over them again.\n\n354\n00:18:55.399 --> 00:18:57.540\nDowntime is something that\nwe gotta think about.\n\n355\n00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.910\nWhen we look at the incident impact, how\nlong is it gonna keep those systems down?\n\n356\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.870\nWhat systems are gonna be down?\n\n357\n00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.353\nWhat services can I still provide?\n\n358\n00:19:06.353 --> 00:19:09.450\nThis is something that\nwe've got to think about.\n\n359\n00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:10.660\nHow long is it gonna be down?\n\n360\n00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.120\nWhat are we gonna do If it's down for\na few hours?\n\n361\n00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.457\nWhat do we do if it's down for a day?\n\n362\n00:19:16.457 --> 00:19:19.220\nWhat do we do if it's gonna be down for\nlonger than that?\n\n363\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.240\nHow can we shorten that time?\n\n364\n00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.560\nOne day is not acceptable.\n\n365\n00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.160\nI cannot be down for a day.\n\n366\n00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.580\nThe amount of money that I lose per hour\nwhen my e-commerce site is unavailable is\n\n367\n00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.640\njust going up and up and up.\n\n368\n00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.710\nSo what can we do to reduce that downtime,\nsomething we're always looking to do.\n\n369\n00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.740\n&gt;&gt; And Mike, I can only imagine on the\nopposite side of that coin, just flipping\n\n370\n00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.720\nit over, that there would be recovery time\nthat we have to think about, as well.\n\n371\n00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.564\nNow why would recovery time be something\nthat we have to consider an impact\n\n372\n00:19:44.564 --> 00:19:45.995\nof an incident happening?\n\n373\n00:19:45.995 --> 00:19:48.499\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you think about\nyou're doing your backups, but\n\n374\n00:19:48.499 --> 00:19:50.970\nhow long is it gonna take you\nto restore those backups?\n\n375\n00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:54.148\nHow long is it gonna take you to get,\n\n376\n00:19:56.644 --> 00:20:00.000\nEverything reset and\nget back up and running?\n\n377\n00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.900\nThat's part of that recovery time.\n\n378\n00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:07.200\nAnd we wanna make sure that\ndowntime versus recovery time,\n\n379\n00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.765\nit's not that they can run concurrently,\nright?\n\n380\n00:20:11.765 --> 00:20:15.219\nYour downtime,\nhow long that service is unavailable,\n\n381\n00:20:15.219 --> 00:20:19.980\nwell your recovery is gonna be\noccurring during that downtime, right?\n\n382\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.220\nWhile it's down, my butt is busy\ntrying to recover these systems and\n\n383\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.070\nget them back up.\n\n384\n00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.740\nSo it's not that they go to end to end,\nor anything like that.\n\n385\n00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.580\nBut we're always trying to reduce both.\n\n386\n00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.000\nI wanna minimize my downtime.\n\n387\n00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.140\nAnd typically what that means is\ndiscovering the event has occurred and\n\n388\n00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.270\nthen reducing my recovery time.\n\n389\n00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.480\nHow long it's gonna take me\nto get systems back up and\n\n390\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:45.100\nrunning, and that's gonna vary based on\nthe number of systems that were affected,\n\n391\n00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.070\nhow large the backups are, for example.\n\n392\n00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.520\nLike I said, re-imaging one of my laptops,\nthere's no data stored locally.\n\n393\n00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.670\nSo it's just a matter of pulling down an\nimage which can be done in 15, 20 minutes.\n\n394\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.687\nIf it's a server that I've got to\nrestore and then get the backups and\n\n395\n00:20:59.687 --> 00:21:02.526\nrestore those, but\nmaybe I've got to figure out\n\n396\n00:21:02.526 --> 00:21:07.180\nwhen this incident occurred cuz I don't\nknow if that backup is corrupt as well.\n\n397\n00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.927\nThat backup might have the malware in it.\n\n398\n00:21:08.927 --> 00:21:10.990\nHow far back do I have to go?\n\n399\n00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.440\nSo a lot of things that I'm gonna\nhave to try to figure out and\n\n400\n00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:20.441\nthat's just gonna make my recovery\ntime take a little bit longer.\n\n401\n00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:25.182\nData integrity is another one that we've\ngot to make sure we consider a very\n\n402\n00:21:25.182 --> 00:21:26.320\nimportant part.\n\n403\n00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.680\nYou see this a lot in databases but\n\n404\n00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.010\nthat doesn't mean it can't be\ndone on individual files as well.\n\n405\n00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.840\nIntegrity meaning the data hasn't\nbeen modified, either accidentally or\n\n406\n00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.560\nmaliciously, right?\n\n407\n00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.840\nIt's been modified only\nby authorized personnel,\n\n408\n00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.500\nwhoever's allowed to make those changes.\n\n409\n00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.730\nIf a bad guy comes in and\ngets access to your website and\n\n410\n00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:50.440\ndefaces your webpage, and potentially\nsteals data out of your database,\n\n411\n00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.730\nhas he changed any of that information,\nhas he modified that?\n\n412\n00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:58.390\nWe need to do integrity checks on our\ndata on a regular basis to look for\n\n413\n00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.860\nmalicious changes to that information.\n\n414\n00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.570\nSame thing with our file servers.\n\n415\n00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:08.556\nRunning hashes on important files,\narchived files.\n\n416\n00:22:08.556 --> 00:22:10.330\nOur operating systems do that, right?\n\n417\n00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.869\nOur operating systems run all of our\nimportant system files through hashing\n\n418\n00:22:13.869 --> 00:22:15.754\nalgorithms, store that information.\n\n419\n00:22:15.754 --> 00:22:18.564\nAnd when we start our system up,\nthey're gonna compare the current,\n\n420\n00:22:18.564 --> 00:22:20.946\nthey're gonna run the files\nthrough a hashing algorithm,\n\n421\n00:22:20.946 --> 00:22:23.822\ncompared to the one they had before,\nmake sure they haven't changed.\n\n422\n00:22:23.822 --> 00:22:24.932\nOtherwise it's gonna notify you.\n\n423\n00:22:24.932 --> 00:22:27.612\nHey, something in your system\nboot time has been modified.\n\n424\n00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:28.712\nAre you sure this is okay?\n\n425\n00:22:28.712 --> 00:22:30.612\nOr making you aware of it.\n\n426\n00:22:30.612 --> 00:22:36.242\nSo data integrity is a big part\nof maintaining our security.\n\n427\n00:22:36.242 --> 00:22:41.900\nAnd when we talk about incident impact,\nif that data was modified\n\n428\n00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.840\nmaliciously and intentionally,\nI've gotta now recover that information.\n\n429\n00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.530\nI've gotta go back to a backup when\nthe data was in a known good state and\n\n430\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:50.550\nI've gotta restore that.\n\n431\n00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.830\nSo the more information that\nmight have been compromised,\n\n432\n00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.930\nthe longer it's gonna take me to recover.\n\n433\n00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:02.489\nEconomic impact is another big thing we\nhave to worry about with our Incidents,\n\n434\n00:23:02.489 --> 00:23:05.509\njust from the downtime alone can cost.\n\n435\n00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:09.209\nI know I looked it up a long, long, long\ntime ago how much Amazon, for example,\n\n436\n00:23:09.209 --> 00:23:10.770\nmakes per hour on their website.\n\n437\n00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.480\nIt's ungodly amount of money.\n\n438\n00:23:13.695 --> 00:23:18.007\nBut most organizations have e-commerce and\na lot of them rely strictly on e-commerce,\n\n439\n00:23:18.007 --> 00:23:21.817\nand if that site goes down we're not\nselling anything, we're losing money.\n\n440\n00:23:21.817 --> 00:23:26.175\nSo there's a direct economic\nimpact there as far as not being\n\n441\n00:23:26.175 --> 00:23:27.980\nable to sell my product.\n\n442\n00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.880\nBut that's not the only impact, right?\n\n443\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.118\nThere's other economic impacts.\n\n444\n00:23:31.118 --> 00:23:35.061\nAs the word gets out there we've been\ncompromised, if this gets publicized,\n\n445\n00:23:35.061 --> 00:23:38.286\nif this is something that we've\ngot to notify our customers of,\n\n446\n00:23:38.286 --> 00:23:41.059\nhow many of those customers\nare never gonna come back?\n\n447\n00:23:41.059 --> 00:23:43.888\nHow many of them are gonna tell\ntheir friends, gosh don't go there?\n\n448\n00:23:43.888 --> 00:23:46.565\nRight, and\ndon't use your credit card in this place.\n\n449\n00:23:46.565 --> 00:23:47.592\nOr switch companies.\n\n450\n00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:51.935\nOr people that might have been considering\nusing your service that you provide\n\n451\n00:23:51.935 --> 00:23:56.340\nare now going to somebody else\nbecause they read about your breach.\n\n452\n00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.660\nSo there can be a far\nreaching financial impact or\n\n453\n00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.610\neconomic impact on the organization.\n\n454\n00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:07.490\nNo, not good,\nI mean it's a not a good thing.\n\n455\n00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.270\nSystem process,\nwhat the heck I wrote there,\n\n456\n00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.610\nI can't read my own notes at this point.\n\n457\n00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.390\nSystem processes, yeah, I really don't\nknow what I meant to write there.\n\n458\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.760\nBut That's interesting.\n\n459\n00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.920\nNow, we're talking about different types\nof information that can be compromised.\n\n460\n00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.080\nAgain, some more terms that you\nneed to be familiar with for\n\n461\n00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.710\nthis particular exam, PII and PHI.\n\n462\n00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.850\nNow PII, I think most people are probably\nfamiliar with this at this point.\n\n463\n00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:35.990\nPII, Personally Identifiable Information,\nthis is really any bit of information.\n\n464\n00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.630\nThat can identify an individual, right?\n\n465\n00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.310\nOut of a group of people.\n\n466\n00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.930\nSo, we look at things like obvious things.\n\n467\n00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:47.997\nDriver's license numbers, social\nsecurity numbers, first and last name.\n\n468\n00:24:47.997 --> 00:24:50.784\nPhone numbers can be considered.\n\n469\n00:24:50.784 --> 00:24:54.666\nPersonally identifiable information,\nbecause with that single bit of\n\n470\n00:24:54.666 --> 00:24:57.083\ninformation, I can go\nto a reverse lookup and\n\n471\n00:24:57.083 --> 00:25:00.150\nget the name that's associated\nwith that phone number.\n\n472\n00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:06.340\nSome personally identifiable information\nis called, linked, personally identifiable\n\n473\n00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.430\ninformation, cuz on it's own, it might\nnot be able to identify the individual.\n\n474\n00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.940\nLike first name,\ntypically is not considered PII.\n\n475\n00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.270\nFirst and last name would be.\n\n476\n00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.860\nSo some information might\nbe considered linked\n\n477\n00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.670\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n478\n00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.090\nBIometrics, it's another\nthat we're seeing more and\n\n479\n00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.785\nmore of, cuz it's a great\nauthentication method, but that\n\n480\n00:25:27.785 --> 00:25:31.235\nmeans they've gotta store that information\nsomewhere, so let's verify that.\n\n481\n00:25:31.235 --> 00:25:32.685\nInformation you can get hacked or\n\n482\n00:25:32.685 --> 00:25:36.555\nstolen, that's personally\nidentifiable information.\n\n483\n00:25:36.555 --> 00:25:38.745\nAnd there's usually laws and regulations.\n\n484\n00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:42.525\nIf your organization deals with PII, you\ndefinitely wanna make sure you understand\n\n485\n00:25:42.525 --> 00:25:46.510\nthe laws and regulations of your area for\nhow you have to store that information,\n\n486\n00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:50.800\nhow you have to protect it while it's\nstored, how you have to control access\n\n487\n00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.480\nto that information and what you need\nto do if there's a potential breach.\n\n488\n00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.210\nIf there's a suspected breach of\ninformation or a compromise of that\n\n489\n00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.270\ninformation, who you need to notify,\nhow long you have to notify them.\n\n490\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.990\nVery, very important.\n\n491\n00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:08.910\nAnd then PHI, is really just an extension\nof personal identifiable information,\n\n492\n00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:11.200\npersonal health information.\n\n493\n00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.930\nThings like your medical history,\ntest records, lab results,\n\n494\n00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.940\ninsurance information would fall\nunder this category as well.\n\n495\n00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.105\nAnd obviously if you're\na health care organization,\n\n496\n00:26:24.105 --> 00:26:26.823\nhere in the States anyway we've\ngot HIPAA that says hey look,\n\n497\n00:26:26.823 --> 00:26:29.446\nyou've got to protect this and\nhere's what you have to do.\n\n498\n00:26:29.446 --> 00:26:33.213\n&gt;&gt; You mentioned some of those types of\ninformation that fall under HIPAA and\n\n499\n00:26:33.213 --> 00:26:34.496\nfall under the.\n\n500\n00:26:34.496 --> 00:26:37.255\nNow how about, we've talked in other\nepisodes, another standard that we have\n\n501\n00:26:37.255 --> 00:26:40.153\nto worry about because we have things like\ncredit card payments out there, right?\n\n502\n00:26:40.153 --> 00:26:43.912\nSo not only do we have to implement\nsomething like PCI DSS, but\n\n503\n00:26:43.912 --> 00:26:47.037\nwe have to worry about that as well,\nright, Mike?\n\n504\n00:26:47.037 --> 00:26:51.515\nAbsolutely, and I think we mentioned it\nanother day, it's not a legal requirement\n\n505\n00:26:51.515 --> 00:26:54.682\nas far as the government or\na regulation here in the States.\n\n506\n00:26:54.682 --> 00:26:59.162\nBut a lot of the credit card\nvendors all requiring their,\n\n507\n00:26:59.162 --> 00:27:04.294\nif you wanna put a Visa station\nin your store, they're gonna make\n\n508\n00:27:04.294 --> 00:27:09.264\nsure that you comply with PCIDSS\nif I can say that, the PCIDSS.\n\n509\n00:27:09.264 --> 00:27:14.177\nBecause they want to protect themselves,\nand it reduces their liability in the long\n\n510\n00:27:14.177 --> 00:27:17.566\nrun if they can prove that they\nare compliant with this, or\n\n511\n00:27:17.566 --> 00:27:19.520\nit can help them in that respect.\n\n512\n00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.150\nSo we gotta protect\npayment card information.\n\n513\n00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:27.480\nIntellectual property,\nis another one that we have to deal with.\n\n514\n00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.176\nIntellectual property is\nsometimes tricky to define.\n\n515\n00:27:31.176 --> 00:27:35.509\nBut it's really any product of\ncreativity of the human mind,\n\n516\n00:27:35.509 --> 00:27:37.771\nif you wanna define it that way.\n\n517\n00:27:37.771 --> 00:27:41.064\nThere are different classifications\nof intellectual property and\n\n518\n00:27:41.064 --> 00:27:43.025\nit is define of I shouldn't say that is,\n\n519\n00:27:43.025 --> 00:27:46.719\nI'm not trying to say that it's not,\nI'm saying for me sometimes is hard,\n\n520\n00:27:46.719 --> 00:27:49.920\ncuz the course definitely can\ndefine an intellectual property.\n\n521\n00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.326\nBut departing employees\nstealing trade secrets,\n\n522\n00:27:53.326 --> 00:27:55.949\nthat would be intellectual property.\n\n523\n00:27:55.949 --> 00:28:02.860\nAnything that the organizations have come\nup with, even work methods that they use.\n\n524\n00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.810\nProcedures can be considered\nintellectual property.\n\n525\n00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.710\nYou might have two companies\nthat do the same thing, but\n\n526\n00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.100\ndo it slightly differently.\n\n527\n00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.220\nAnd that method can be considered\nintellectual property.\n\n528\n00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.710\nStoring intellectual property\non an unsecured device.\n\n529\n00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:18.800\nWe have to worry about our users.\n\n530\n00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.330\nI'm just gonna take this home and\nwork on it over the weekend, right.\n\n531\n00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.890\nAnd they put it on the thumb drive, and\nnow that thumb drive they dropped it in\n\n532\n00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.460\nthe parking lot, it's not encrypted,\nthey left it in their car, they left it on\n\n533\n00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.260\nthe coffee table or the table at\nStarbucks, or something like that.\n\n534\n00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.440\nThat's another way we can\nlose that information.\n\n535\n00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.550\nEmployees installing malware,\nbecause as I said before,\n\n536\n00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.990\nwe all have that one employee that\nwill click on anything out there.\n\n537\n00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:43.240\nSo what do we do?\n\n538\n00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.980\nWe restrict and monitor access.\n\n539\n00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.440\nTo any type of intellectual property.\n\n540\n00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.630\nWe encrypt that intellectual property.\n\n541\n00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:56.026\nMake sure we have policies in place and\nmake sure those policies are enforced.\n\n542\n00:28:56.026 --> 00:29:01.038\nMake sure we train our employees on how\nto deal with intellectual property.\n\n543\n00:29:01.038 --> 00:29:03.421\nMake sure it's part of our\nincident response plan.\n\n544\n00:29:03.421 --> 00:29:07.077\nAnd another couple of terms, I know\nI'm running out of time, Wes, I get,\n\n545\n00:29:07.077 --> 00:29:08.015\nyou gotta finish.\n\n546\n00:29:08.015 --> 00:29:11.797\nCorporate confidential, just a couple\nof more terms I wanna throw at you that\n\n547\n00:29:11.797 --> 00:29:13.690\nare gonna be on the objectives.\n\n548\n00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:17.950\nAccounting data mergers and acquisitions,\nWe talk about corporate confidential.\n\n549\n00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.224\nReally intellectual property\nkind of covers that.\n\n550\n00:29:20.224 --> 00:29:25.707\nInformation related to trade\nsecret processes styles of work.\n\n551\n00:29:25.707 --> 00:29:30.792\nIt might not be, sometimes when we talk\nabout corporate confidential It might\n\n552\n00:29:30.792 --> 00:29:35.888\nnot be legally protected, but it's still\nsomething that I want to maintain.\n\n553\n00:29:35.888 --> 00:29:38.277\nIt's not meant for\ngeneral public consumption.\n\n554\n00:29:38.277 --> 00:29:39.866\nIt's meant for internal use only.\n\n555\n00:29:39.866 --> 00:29:43.218\nIt's corporate property or\nconsidered corporate confidential.\n\n556\n00:29:43.218 --> 00:29:46.049\nAnd even within the corporation\nthere might be limits like,\n\n557\n00:29:46.049 --> 00:29:49.115\nnot everybody in the company gets\naccess to salary information.\n\n558\n00:29:49.115 --> 00:29:52.039\nSo corporate confidential accounting data,\npretty obvious,\n\n559\n00:29:52.039 --> 00:29:54.158\nwe don't want people\ngetting into our books.\n\n560\n00:29:54.158 --> 00:29:57.320\nAnd last thing was mergers and\nacquisitions.\n\n561\n00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.850\nAnd this is a tenuous time for\norganizations.\n\n562\n00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:04.870\nWhen you start talking about mergers and\nacquisitions, because this is when we're\n\n563\n00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:09.040\ntaking, a lot of times, taking two\nnetworks, two organizations, and\n\n564\n00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.200\nmerging them together, right, or\nwe're acquiring this other company.\n\n565\n00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.190\nWell what happens during that process?\n\n566\n00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:16.710\nI've gotta get all their\ninformation into my network, or\n\n567\n00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.710\nwe're gonna tie our networks together.\n\n568\n00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.570\nThey've got employees that\nnow work under our umbrella.\n\n569\n00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.320\nSo I need to give them access.\n\n570\n00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:27.590\nI've gotta maintain access to the\ninformation that they were pulling over.\n\n571\n00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:30.350\nThe problem becomes, this is is a great,\nthis is not a great time,\n\n572\n00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.870\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n573\n00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.550\nThe bad actors will take\nadvantage of this period.\n\n574\n00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:37.970\nBecause a lot of times we have\nto reduce our security, because\n\n575\n00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:40.880\nhere comes this person, they come working\nin the front door like they work here.\n\n576\n00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.600\nI don't know them, never seen them before.\n\n577\n00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.500\nThey do work here,\nthey're just part of that merger.\n\n578\n00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.680\nI didn't meet everybody yet.\n\n579\n00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.790\nSo, my employees who are normally really\ngood about stopping people in the hallways\n\n580\n00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:53.480\nand saying, hey, can I help you,\n\n581\n00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.930\nbecause they don't recognize them\ncuz I've trained them to do that.\n\n582\n00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.770\nWell, now all of a sudden we've\ngot this influx of new people\n\n583\n00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.520\nthat they don't recognize, and\nafter the fourth one says.\n\n584\n00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.500\nYes, I'm from the other company you just\nbought, they stopped doing it, right?\n\n585\n00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.210\nAnd now, the bad guys can take\nadvantage of that, and slip in.\n\n586\n00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:12.010\nOur network security is gonna be\na little lax, or be reduced sometimes,\n\n587\n00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:15.445\nas we move everything over, and\nwe adjust access policies and\n\n588\n00:31:15.445 --> 00:31:17.405\nwe figure out what they've got,\nwhat we've got.\n\n589\n00:31:17.405 --> 00:31:19.185\nHow it's all going to tie together.\n\n590\n00:31:19.185 --> 00:31:22.455\nSo, definitely it's a good way to say,\n\n591\n00:31:22.455 --> 00:31:27.627\na time that we need to be on our toes,\nlooking for breaches.\n\n592\n00:31:27.627 --> 00:31:31.777\n&gt;&gt; It seems like the impact of these\nincidences can be a lot more far reaching\n\n593\n00:31:31.777 --> 00:31:35.137\nthan one would think if you're\nnot well-informed on that one.\n\n594\n00:31:35.137 --> 00:31:37.007\nMike, a lot of great information,\nthank you.\n\n595\n00:31:37.007 --> 00:31:39.177\nIt does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n596\n00:31:39.177 --> 00:31:42.920\nBut before we do, when it comes to impact\nincidences are there any generalized\n\n597\n00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.610\nstatements that you would like to let\nour viewers know before we sign out?\n\n598\n00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:50.370\n&gt;&gt; No I don't think so I think it's just\nmainly understanding that when you're\n\n599\n00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:54.220\ndealing with that\nincidence we've got to kind\n\n600\n00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.500\nof take a big p[picture approach to it\n&gt;&gt; Really make sure we're understanding\n\n601\n00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:01.410\nwhat happened, what the scope of the\nproblem was and what the impact is going\n\n602\n00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:07.710\nto be before we start rushing\nin to do our incident response.\n\n603\n00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.850\nYou know,\npart of the incident response, I guess,\n\n604\n00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:14.070\nis just making sure we understand what the\nscope and the impact of the incident is.\n\n605\n00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.780\n&gt;&gt; Words of wisdom.\n\n606\n00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:15.770\nThank you there Mr. Rodrick.\n\n607\n00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:18.890\nWe appreciate having you in the studio and\nwe appreciate you,\n\n608\n00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:20.440\nthe viewer, watching\n&gt;&gt; Signing out for\n\n609\n00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.430\nITPro TV I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n610\n00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:23.370\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

ITVPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:15.590\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another great\nepisode here in the ITPRO.TV studios.\n\n4\n00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.840\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan and\ndo you like security?\n\n5\n00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.090\nWell if you do, you're in the right\nspot cuz we are coming back at you with\n\n6\n00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.390\nmore CompTIA Cyber Security Analyst Plus.\n\n7\n00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.414\nAnd joining us in the studios\nis none other than Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:25.414 --> 00:00:27.122\nMike Rodrick, Mike how are you doing sir?\n\n9\n00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:31.030\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great Wes thanks for having\nme back, I'm excited to be here as always.\n\n10\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.067\nSo what do we got for today?\n\n11\n00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:35.688\nToday we're gonna be\nlooking at forensic tools,\n\n12\n00:00:35.688 --> 00:00:40.096\nit's one of our objectives in\nour CSA plus exam objectives.\n\n13\n00:00:40.096 --> 00:00:44.929\nAnd so the first thing I wanna talk about\nis just building up what they would call\n\n14\n00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.930\na forensics kit, we're gonna talk a little\nbit about a forensics work station.\n\n15\n00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.110\nTalk about how I might go about\nbuilding or obtaining one of those.\n\n16\n00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.410\nTake a look at some of the things that we\nneed to include in our forensics tool kit\n\n17\n00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.790\nand then, as well as some different\nforms and things like that.\n\n18\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.010\nAnd in some later episodes,\n\n19\n00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.600\nI actually wanna go back and\nkinda demonstrate some of the software.\n\n20\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.210\nTowards the end of these objectives, they\nactually call out the individual tools.\n\n21\n00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.630\nAnd we'll get to take a look at them,\nbut for\n\n22\n00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.950\nnow we're just gonna talk about\nwhat we mean by a forensics kit and\n\n23\n00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.480\na forensics workstation, and\nprobably don't need a lot of explanation.\n\n24\n00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.580\nA forensics workstation is a workstation\nthat's setup with all the appropriate\n\n25\n00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.550\nhardware and software to do\na computer forensics investigation.\n\n26\n00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.580\nSo if you have a machine that has\nbecome infected or compromised or\n\n27\n00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.190\nhacked, this is where you're gonna\ngo to do your investigation.\n\n28\n00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.700\nSo it's really just a machine that's\npre-loaded with all the hardware and\n\n29\n00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.010\nsoftware that you're gonna need\nto do a thorough examination\n\n30\n00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.200\nwithout modifying anything on\nthe original machine, right?\n\n31\n00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.890\nThat's always going to be the key.\n\n32\n00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.170\nAnd we'll talk a little bit about that,\nas well.\n\n33\n00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.230\nNow, when it comes to a forensics\nwork station, there's hundreds and\n\n34\n00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.930\nhundreds of opinions.\n\n35\n00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.600\nAll of them, I'm sure, are good.\n\n36\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.670\nEverybody thinks their own is better,\nright?\n\n37\n00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.490\nThere is no one answer\nfits all type thing.\n\n38\n00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.140\nIt really depends on what you're\ngonna need in your environment.\n\n39\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.270\nIf you're a strictly Windows shop,\n\n40\n00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.890\nthen that changes what you might\nneed in that forensic work station.\n\n41\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.750\nIf you're a mixed environment,\nyou've got Windows and\n\n42\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.990\nLinux, well I'm gonna need possibly\ndifferent tools, different connectors,\n\n43\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.010\ndifferent things to work with\nthe different operating systems.\n\n44\n00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.280\nWe've got different hard drive types,\n\n45\n00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.060\ndifferent like I said operating systems,\nthings like that.\n\n46\n00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.780\nSo it's not that there's\na one answer fits all but\n\n47\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.170\nwe can customize it to what we need.\n\n48\n00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.800\nOr you can even go out and\nbuy pre-built ones if you got the money.\n\n49\n00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.190\nSo let's take a look at that first.\n\n50\n00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.050\nLet's just start right there.\n\n51\n00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.950\nSo what I wanna do,\ntake a look at my screen.\n\n52\n00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.890\nAnd I'm just gonna pull up, and\n\n53\n00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.180\nby no means am I trying to plug any one of\nthese, or say one's better than the other,\n\n54\n00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.520\nI'm just giving you some\nexamples of what are out there.\n\n55\n00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.700\nThis first one I'm gonna go to, is Digital\nReconnaissance, and they've been known for\n\n56\n00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.910\na while to make these\nforensic workstations,\n\n57\n00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.400\nthere's is called\nThe Patriot Forensic work station.\n\n58\n00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.910\nAnd I want to see how good\nthat looks on my screen,\n\n59\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.120\nlet's just zoom in a wee bit on this guy.\n\n60\n00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.280\nMaybe not quite that far,\nlittle lag there on my zoom.\n\n61\n00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.614\nSo this is a Patriot Forensic Workstation,\nagain from Digital Reconnaissance,\n\n62\n00:03:25.614 --> 00:03:29.321\nmiddle tier forensics systems for\nlaw enforcement, corporations,\n\n63\n00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:30.700\nconsulting firms.\n\n64\n00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.160\nAnd you can see some of the standards.\n\n65\n00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.120\nA pretty nice motherboard, liquid\ncooled processor, 32 gigs of memory,\n\n66\n00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.550\n10 terabytes of enterprise class RAID.\n\n67\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.640\nA big, fat, GPU there.\n\n68\n00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.040\nDual monitors, all customizable, though.\n\n69\n00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.570\nWe take a look at the features that\nare gonna be on this type of machine.\n\n70\n00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.750\nSee it's a cooler master case.\n\n71\n00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.820\nSo this is pre-built,\nthis does mean I couldn't go out and\n\n72\n00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.330\nuse this as a shopping list and\nmaybe pick and\n\n73\n00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.060\nchoose some of the parts that I want and\nneed and build my own.\n\n74\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.490\nBut with the pre-built you know\nyou're gonna get a warranty and\n\n75\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.980\nsupport and it's tested, configured, and\nyou know everything is gonna work nicely.\n\n76\n00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.450\nBut in the end when you look at these,\nhardware wise,\n\n77\n00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.440\nit's really just building\nup a nice beefy machine.\n\n78\n00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.670\nYou're gonna need lots of storage\nspace because you're gonna be storing\n\n79\n00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.620\nforensic images that\nyou're gonna be analyzing.\n\n80\n00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.280\nYou're gonna need a lot of RAM to be\nable to process large amounts of data.\n\n81\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.685\nA nice fast processor.\n\n82\n00:04:26.685 --> 00:04:30.910\nA bit fat GPU and you might think why,\nwhat's the GPU for?\n\n83\n00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.780\nWell, I can leverage those GPUs to do\npassword cracking, take some of that work\n\n84\n00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.890\noff my processor, speed that kind of\nthing up, also streaming good movies.\n\n85\n00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.115\nNo, kidding,\nnot on your forensic work station, right?\n\n86\n00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:43.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\n\n87\n00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.070\nI'm looking at this and\nreally when it comes down to it I\n\n88\n00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.820\nthink some gamers would be looking\nat this machine drooling too.\n\n89\n00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.580\nSo, looks like a lot of the power and\n\n90\n00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.710\nthe computational power that you would\nneed to get those frames per second\n\n91\n00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.890\nmight be the same type of computational\npower you need to, whether you're\n\n92\n00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.420\nI guess decrypting information or\nencrypting, however it might work.\n\n93\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.370\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n94\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.136\nI mean, this would make a nice\ngaming rig most likely.\n\n95\n00:05:06.136 --> 00:05:11.390\nWhat the differences that you'll see\nfrom just building a normal high-end PC\n\n96\n00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.640\nto a forensics work station on the hard\nlevel is really storage space but\n\n97\n00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.040\nalso connectivity.\n\n98\n00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.570\nIf you look here,\nlet's see what they show.\n\n99\n00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.990\n2 times Intel 240 sata, 8-port SAS RAID,\nI guess that's for their internal storage.\n\n100\n00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.920\nI don't see a lot of\nthe connectivity listed here.\n\n101\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.538\nI see three FireWire ports.\n\n102\n00:05:34.538 --> 00:05:40.476\nBut really, here,\n3.5\" TRAY-LESS DUAL 2.5\" SATA MOBILE RACK.\n\n103\n00:05:40.476 --> 00:05:44.027\nSo I can plug drives in, most of them\nare right there on top of the case.\n\n104\n00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:47.655\nIt's gonna have some bays or\nsome slots where I can plug drives in,\n\n105\n00:05:47.655 --> 00:05:50.915\nnot have to even open up my case or\nanything like that.\n\n106\n00:05:50.915 --> 00:05:51.615\nPretty nice there.\n\n107\n00:05:51.615 --> 00:05:53.085\nAnd again, that's just one example.\n\n108\n00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:54.240\nLet's go take a look at another one.\n\n109\n00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.270\nI don't want to think that I'm\npicking one over the other.\n\n110\n00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.610\nLet's see that was Digital Intelligence,\nor\n\n111\n00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.290\nReconnaissance, here's\nDigital Intelligence.\n\n112\n00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.518\nAnother company Digital Intelligence,\nthey also do some.\n\n113\n00:06:06.518 --> 00:06:11.470\nIn fact you'll notice that Patriot or\nDigital Reconnaissance is actually\n\n114\n00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.360\npicking on Digital Intelligence a little\nbit here, if I can get their page to open.\n\n115\n00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.030\nNotice they say, why be just any Tom,\nDick, or Fred when you can be a Patriot?\n\n116\n00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.760\nThat's their system.\n\n117\n00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.806\nAnd if Digital Intelligence\nwill actually load up here.\n\n118\n00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:31.890\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n119\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.107\nInteresting, anyway,\nthey've got some forensics systems,\n\n120\n00:06:34.107 --> 00:06:37.660\nand it'll pull up in a minute I'm sure,\nand they're called F.R.E.D..\n\n121\n00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.348\nSo, Fred and Freddy and here we go.\n\n122\n00:06:40.348 --> 00:06:45.950\nThe forensics workstations,\nlet me zoom in to this page a little bit.\n\n123\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.396\nAll right, so there's F.R.E.D.,\nfamily of forensic workstations so\n\n124\n00:06:50.396 --> 00:06:52.850\nnow you get the joke that the other\ncompany was trying to make.\n\n125\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.580\nAnd again, I'm not saying one\nis better than the other.\n\n126\n00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.830\nDon't actually own these guys.\n\n127\n00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.760\nI don't have the money that it\ntakes to put out one of these.\n\n128\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.295\nBut again, you know,\nthis one is a nice system.\n\n129\n00:07:05.295 --> 00:07:09.460\nWe see this one has interesting\nintegrated capabilities.\n\n130\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.698\nIDE drive, Write Blocker,\nSATA drive, Write Blocker, SAS,\n\n131\n00:07:14.698 --> 00:07:19.757\nUSB, FireWire, PCIE,\nFireWire if I can actually say that.\n\n132\n00:07:19.757 --> 00:07:25.510\nSo again, just a pre-built solution for\ndoing forensics on computers.\n\n133\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.301\nAll right, and if you're gonna go to\nbuy one of these what you need to do\n\n134\n00:07:30.301 --> 00:07:32.710\nis think about what you're\ngoing to be performing.\n\n135\n00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.000\nWhat types of investigations or\n\n136\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.480\nwhat level of performance do\nyou need out of those machines?\n\n137\n00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.770\nBut you don't have to as\nI've said a couple of times,\n\n138\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.310\nyou don't have to buy one of these.\n\n139\n00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.360\nYou can always just build your\nown if that's your thing.\n\n140\n00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.039\nAnd especially if you're on a budget,\nthat might be the way you wanna go.\n\n141\n00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:55.110\nAnd I have a PDF from, where is it,\nfrom SANS, here we go.\n\n142\n00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.534\nIt's a little bit older.\n\n143\n00:07:58.534 --> 00:08:01.891\nI can't remember what the date was\non this, but this is SANS, and\n\n144\n00:08:01.891 --> 00:08:03.800\nit's free from their reading room.\n\n145\n00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.770\nI mentioned that in a previous episode.\n\n146\n00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.760\nBuilding a low cost forensic work station,\nand\n\n147\n00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:14.190\nit's gonna walk you through what you need,\nplanning, preparation.\n\n148\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.120\nWe get down here.\n\n149\n00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.140\nWhat kind of hardware you\nwould probably want and\n\n150\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.880\nthese are from some security experts that\nknow and have done this kind of thing.\n\n151\n00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.950\nSo they're going to tell you,\nhey, you need support for\n\n152\n00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.890\nIDEE, iSCSI, network connectivity.\n\n153\n00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.820\nDifferent file types that you're\ngoing to want to be able to support.\n\n154\n00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:38.250\nSo, again, freely available from Sans and\nout there, check out their reading room,\n\n155\n00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.120\nor use your favorite search engine and\nsearch for build a forensic work station.\n\n156\n00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.670\nAnd most likely, one of the first few\nlinks will point you back to SANS.\n\n157\n00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.240\nSo hardware wise, again, just have to\nchoose whether I wanna go out and do\n\n158\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.500\nthe prebuilt route, where I can just order\nit, have it delivered, set up ready to go.\n\n159\n00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.470\nOr do I want to try to build my own and\npick and\n\n160\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.780\nchoose my own custom components\nthat are gonna go in there.\n\n161\n00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.630\nSome of the things that we would look for\nor put in there which we saw in\n\n162\n00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.590\na couple of those listings when we\nlook at features, are write blockers.\n\n163\n00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.820\nWhat do I mean by write blocker,\nthis is not when you're trying\n\n164\n00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.560\nto write your novels and your sitting\nthere in the middle of the night and\n\n165\n00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.040\nyou can't, that's [LAUGH] I\nshouldn't even make that joke.\n\n166\n00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.190\nAnyway, that's not what\na write blocker is.\n\n167\n00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.600\nWhat a write blocker is is it's gonna\nprevent the system from writing\n\n168\n00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.490\nto a drive.\n\n169\n00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.970\nWhen you're doing a forensics\ninvestigation on a system, right,\n\n170\n00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.740\nyou're gonna take that hard drive and\nyou need to examine it.\n\n171\n00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.030\nThe files are on it, the files that\nare no longer on it, files that have been\n\n172\n00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:42.810\ndeleted, we have to make sure that\nwe don't modify that in any way.\n\n173\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:47.720\nWe've all watched the Law and Orders and\nall of those different law shows and\n\n174\n00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.150\nwe probably have a little bit of\nan idea of where I'm going with this.\n\n175\n00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.990\n&gt;&gt; My thought was here,\n\n176\n00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.030\nMIke, you have your chain of custody\nthat you have to go through.\n\n177\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.965\nYou have to make sure that when you take\nthat into, you collect it first right?\n\n178\n00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:01.610\n[INAUDIBLE] you,\nthe data acquisition part.\n\n179\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.630\nBut it needs to maintain its integrity,\nright,\n\n180\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.960\nuntil its presented in a court of law.\n\n181\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.820\nSo is this like on of those first steps\nwhen you are acquiring that information?\n\n182\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely, because\nthe problem is if you modify anything\n\n183\n00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.870\nwell the defense if gonna get\nthat evidence thrown out.\n\n184\n00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.400\nIf they say that hey, this has been\nchanged after you took the evidence into\n\n185\n00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.170\ncustody, then you're gonna have to\nsomehow prove, if you can at all,\n\n186\n00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.920\nthat you didn't modify the information\nthat you're actually looking at.\n\n187\n00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.690\nAnd sometimes just mounting up a hard\ndrive in another system changes a lot of\n\n188\n00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.410\nthe metadata about the files and about\nthe file system and things like that.\n\n189\n00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.790\nAnd that's enough to possibly get that\nthrown out of a court by some good\n\n190\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.630\nlawyers.\n\n191\n00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.060\nBecause obviously people\nare innocent til proven guilty.\n\n192\n00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:41.910\nThat kind of thing.\n\n193\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.160\nSo we have to do our job and\n\n194\n00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.950\nmake sure when we collect evidence\nwe're not altering evidence in any way.\n\n195\n00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.930\nWhat that means with hard drives is\nwe're going to use write-blockers.\n\n196\n00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:56.210\nWe're going to prevent the system from\nbeing able to send any type of write\n\n197\n00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.740\ncommands to the controller\non that hard drive, or\n\n198\n00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.990\nflash drive, or we can talk about flash\ncards, SD cards, things like that.\n\n199\n00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.972\nAll of those writable media,\n\n200\n00:11:08.972 --> 00:11:13.110\nwe have to be able to make sure that we're\nnot going to make any changes to it.\n\n201\n00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.040\nAnd that's where the write\nblockers come into play.\n\n202\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.780\n&gt;&gt; Now, speaking of the write blockers,\ndo they have different categories?\n\n203\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.340\nAre there different types, Mike?\n\n204\n00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.570\nOr is it a one size fits all,\n\n205\n00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.315\nif I need a write blocker this is\nthe one that I have access to?\n\n206\n00:11:24.315 --> 00:11:27.265\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's software-based and\nthere's hardware-based.\n\n207\n00:11:27.265 --> 00:11:29.295\nSo I can do it via software.\n\n208\n00:11:30.885 --> 00:11:35.565\nThe only problem with doing it via\nsoftware is it's not as reliable.\n\n209\n00:11:35.565 --> 00:11:40.015\nBecause, again, you've gotta mount the\ndrive up into the system and begin to work\n\n210\n00:11:40.015 --> 00:11:43.510\nwith it and get that software to prevent\nrights to it and theres other ways.\n\n211\n00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.842\nAlthough, sometimes those\nsoftware blockers write,\n\n212\n00:11:45.842 --> 00:11:47.410\nblock one wave writing to the drive.\n\n213\n00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.930\nLike a normal call, but\n\n214\n00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:53.900\nthere might be some background calls\nthat get made that go right past it.\n\n215\n00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.445\nIt doesn't see,\nyou just really have to be careful.\n\n216\n00:11:56.445 --> 00:11:59.525\nYou have to understand the write\nblocks software that you're using,\n\n217\n00:11:59.525 --> 00:12:01.165\nknow what it's capable of.\n\n218\n00:12:01.165 --> 00:12:04.055\nUnderstand how to use it properly but\nit was good for\n\n219\n00:12:04.055 --> 00:12:07.175\nany tool really but\njust making sure you've understand that.\n\n220\n00:12:07.175 --> 00:12:10.252\nHardware right block\nare physical devices and\n\n221\n00:12:10.252 --> 00:12:13.947\nlet's take a look I've got\na couple here that I bookmarked.\n\n222\n00:12:13.947 --> 00:12:20.784\nHere's one, this is CRU and\nthey've got the WIEBETECH, and\n\n223\n00:12:20.784 --> 00:12:27.041\nthese are some different right blockers\nthat they have available, all right.\n\n224\n00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:29.341\nThe main thing you're gonna be looking for\nis connectivity on this.\n\n225\n00:12:29.341 --> 00:12:32.851\nAnd you see all of these have\nseveral ports on them for\n\n226\n00:12:32.851 --> 00:12:34.631\nthe different type of connectivity, right?\n\n227\n00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:39.281\nWe've got IDE, SATA, SCSI, SAS\n\n228\n00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:43.180\ndrives whatever the case maybe we don't\nknow what we're gonna into a lot of times.\n\n229\n00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.890\nDepending on what you do.\n\n230\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.190\nIf you're in an organization and\n\n231\n00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.470\nyou know all the hardware in your network,\nmaybe you can limit this.\n\n232\n00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.080\nBut normally I want to have choices.\n\n233\n00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.800\nEspecially if we have BYOD type situations\nwhere they bring in a laptop and\n\n234\n00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.330\nit's got a different connection type\nfrom all the other drives in our office.\n\n235\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.350\nYou can also get these for\nremovable media.\n\n236\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.658\nLet me zoom back out just a little bit.\n\n237\n00:13:07.658 --> 00:13:09.250\nLet's find us the same company here.\n\n238\n00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.330\nMedia write blockers for\ndoing again, Flash,\n\n239\n00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.780\nUSB thumb drive, USB-based hard drives.\n\n240\n00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.200\nThings like that, we can get one of\nthese blockers for those as well.\n\n241\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.910\nAnd again, the idea is that it's\ngonna prevent any changes to those.\n\n242\n00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.450\nAnd then what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna duplicate that drive.\n\n243\n00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.540\nWe're not actually investigating\nthe original drive.\n\n244\n00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.630\nWe use our write blockers so\nthat I can mount the driver up and\n\n245\n00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.870\nmake a bit by bit copy of\nit using other software.\n\n246\n00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.850\nAnd once I've made that copy of it and\nthey are exact duplicates.\n\n247\n00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.890\nI can take the original drives set\nat the side never been modified.\n\n248\n00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:50.040\nAnd I can do all my work on that copy\nthat I've made of that data, alright.\n\n249\n00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.000\nSo software base, hardware based, cables.\n\n250\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.700\nWe're going to need cables to connect\nall these different types of equipment.\n\n251\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.320\nHard drives, thumb drives,\ncard readers, things like that.\n\n252\n00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.245\nI need to be able to take those drives out\nof a system, plug them into my system.\n\n253\n00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:07.945\nI'm not gonna open up my laptop and\nput it inside, right.\n\n254\n00:14:07.945 --> 00:14:08.985\nThat's not gonna work.\n\n255\n00:14:08.985 --> 00:14:13.165\nSo I'm gonna need a sled or a drive bay or\ncables at the bare minimum to\n\n256\n00:14:13.165 --> 00:14:17.065\nconnect to those drives while\nI'll start duplicating them.\n\n257\n00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.682\nWiped removable media.\n\n258\n00:14:18.682 --> 00:14:23.772\nWe're gonna need media to store those\nimages that we make of those hard drives,\n\n259\n00:14:23.772 --> 00:14:29.132\nor of any other data that we've collected,\nwe're doing a scraping of the RAM, right?\n\n260\n00:14:29.132 --> 00:14:33.856\nIf you're trying to get all the volatile\ninformation first before it goes away.\n\n261\n00:14:33.856 --> 00:14:37.756\nWe need storage space for\nthat that I can take with me.\n\n262\n00:14:37.756 --> 00:14:40.806\nNice, clean, sanitized removable media.\n\n263\n00:14:40.806 --> 00:14:46.870\nCameras are an important part\nof your investigative kit.\n\n264\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.950\nPeople sometimes don't\nthink about that but\n\n265\n00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.240\nyou wanna be able to document everything.\n\n266\n00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.230\nAnd back in the day when we had film\nbased cameras, it was kind of a pain.\n\n267\n00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.430\nYou had to pay for film,\npay for developing.\n\n268\n00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.980\nSo you tried to limit the number\nof photos you ended up taking.\n\n269\n00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.350\nNowadays, with digital cameras,\nheck, I can whip out my phone,\n\n270\n00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:09.580\nif I'm in a hard pressed situation,\nand I can take pictures with that.\n\n271\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.670\nAnd I'm talking about taking\npictures of every thing.\n\n272\n00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:16.300\nYou take a picture of the work area,\neverything that's around it, the cup,\n\n273\n00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.160\nthe mouse, the papers,\nwhere the pencils are.\n\n274\n00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.290\nYou take a picture of all the ports on the\ncomputers with the cables still plugged in\n\n275\n00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.400\nso you can go back and\nrecreate this back in your lab.\n\n276\n00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.690\nOkay, they had a thumb\ndrive plugged in here.\n\n277\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.660\nThey had a network cable plugged in here.\n\n278\n00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.180\nThey had this random cable plugged in\nhere, those connected to this or this.\n\n279\n00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.300\nYou're gonna photograph\neverything as you go.\n\n280\n00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.440\nHeck, I use phones sometimes, or\npictures sometimes for screenshots.\n\n281\n00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.280\nCuz it's easier to just take\na picture of the screen.\n\n282\n00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.196\nJust when I first get into it and\n\n283\n00:15:44.196 --> 00:15:48.490\nI'm taking a picture of the environment\nthat you're walking into.\n\n284\n00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:53.382\nWhich will be becoming your crime scene so\ncameras very important having those\n\n285\n00:15:53.382 --> 00:15:59.390\navailable Inexpensive digital cameras\nnowadays, they're pretty easy to obtain.\n\n286\n00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.280\nCrime tape, yeah, I know,\nmakes it sound fun, right?\n\n287\n00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.630\nDo I need to show us\na picture of crime tape?\n\n288\n00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.670\nLet's do it because you know,\n\n289\n00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.615\nyou might not know what the heck\nI mean when I say crime tape.\n\n290\n00:16:09.615 --> 00:16:15.290\nThere we go, now you know, you're like,\nI know what you're talking about, Mike.\n\n291\n00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.840\nWe've seen it in all of the movies and\n\n292\n00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.240\nall the TV shows, maybe even in\nreal life if you are unfortunate.\n\n293\n00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.747\nBut yeah, when there's been a breach or\n\n294\n00:16:22.747 --> 00:16:27.785\na suspected breacher incident of some\nkind, we need to quarantine off the area.\n\n295\n00:16:27.785 --> 00:16:29.171\nWe need to mark the area,\n\n296\n00:16:29.171 --> 00:16:33.395\nmake sure there's no unauthorized\npersonnel coming in or out of that area.\n\n297\n00:16:33.395 --> 00:16:35.430\nAnd this is what you use, right?\n\n298\n00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.990\nMost people are gonna recognize that\nyellow tape that says crime scene on it.\n\n299\n00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.750\nAnd they know they shouldn't\ncross that boundary.\n\n300\n00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.814\nBecause people walking in and\nout, they brush against things,\n\n301\n00:16:44.814 --> 00:16:47.385\nthey pick things up, they move things.\n\n302\n00:16:47.385 --> 00:16:50.835\nI remember working with a guy\nwhen I was first learning, and\n\n303\n00:16:50.835 --> 00:16:54.400\nwe were learning how to do\nan investigation of a scene.\n\n304\n00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.481\nAnd the first thing I did was\ntouch the computer, right?\n\n305\n00:16:57.481 --> 00:17:01.510\n[LAUGH] And he's like stop,\nfailed already, right?\n\n306\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.276\nBecause I was gonna spin it around and\nlook at the other side,\n\n307\n00:17:04.276 --> 00:17:05.807\nbut that's altering the scene.\n\n308\n00:17:05.807 --> 00:17:08.770\nUntil you get everything documented,\nyou don't wanna do that.\n\n309\n00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:13.710\nSo taking pictures, using crime\nscene tape to mark off the area.\n\n310\n00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.510\nAnd it makes it look cool\nwhen you're doing that.\n\n311\n00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.220\nTechnically, yes, you could get anything.\n\n312\n00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.410\nYou could get rope string and\ntie it between chairs or\n\n313\n00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.570\nbarricade a bunch of stools up against it.\n\n314\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.060\nSo people know they just\ncan't walk in there.\n\n315\n00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.490\nBut it's some way to mark the area as,\nhey,\n\n316\n00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.440\nstay back, something is going on here.\n\n317\n00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.940\nTamper proof seals are another\none that we need to try to grab.\n\n318\n00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.470\nAnd I've got a little picture of one here.\n\n319\n00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.900\nAgain, I'm not recommending any brand or\nanything like that.\n\n320\n00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.423\nI just Googled, went on to Amazon for\na couple of these.\n\n321\n00:17:44.423 --> 00:17:48.550\nThis one is Uline, and there's dozens and\ndozens of brands of these.\n\n322\n00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.935\nWe've seen them before\nwhen you buy a computer.\n\n323\n00:17:51.935 --> 00:17:54.550\nYou've got tape over\nthe doors on the back.\n\n324\n00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:58.690\nSometimes gas pumps, nowadays,\nto keep you from, or make you feel safe,\n\n325\n00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.490\nthat nobody's opened it up and\nput a card skimmer in there.\n\n326\n00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.943\nSo you've seen these before, they'll void\nyour warranty when you peel them off\n\n327\n00:18:04.943 --> 00:18:07.088\nbecause it's like the

actually see the words, void appear.\n\n330\n00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.650\nWoops, there's a little lag in my zoom and\n\n331\n00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.550\nso it's a little hard to get\nit to zoom to the right level.\n\n332\n00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:26.370\nSo it's a nice red label, but\nif somebody tries to peel the label off,\n\n333\n00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:31.370\nthey're gonna end up peeling just this and\nthe word voided is written across there.\n\n334\n00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.270\nAnd, again, why are we doing this?\n\n335\n00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:39.150\nSo that we can verify that nobody has\nhas compromised potential evidence.\n\n336\n00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.900\nWe might use these on computers as\nwe're moving them from scene to scene.\n\n337\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:48.810\nFrom the scene back to our investigative\nstations, wherever we're working out of.\n\n338\n00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.580\nI might use them on evidence bags.\n\n339\n00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.640\nThough typically, evidence bags\nhave something built into them for\n\n340\n00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.990\nthat, the tamper proof seals.\n\n341\n00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.820\nAnd while I'm there, evidence bags, right?\n\n342\n00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.120\nBeing able to collect, hey,\nhere's that thumb drive.\n\n343\n00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.421\nOnce I've documented its location,\nwhere it was found.\n\n344\n00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:06.550\nWhether it was plugged in or\nnot, I've taken photos of it.\n\n345\n00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:10.050\nI'm going to take that, and I'm going to\nput it in a nice evidence bag, zip it up.\n\n346\n00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:14.980\nBecause just like the movies,\njust like all the TV shows we've seen.\n\n347\n00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.850\nWe need to follow a chain of custody.\n\n348\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.900\nIt's an extremely important\npart of doing an investigation.\n\n349\n00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.160\nAnd this is probably a good time to say,\nif you don't, if you're not trained or\n\n350\n00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.070\nfeel comfortable in doing this sort\nof investigation, you shouldn't.\n\n351\n00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.980\nYou should get somebody that is,\n\n352\n00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.940\nwhether you've gotta go get\nan outside party to come in.\n\n353\n00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.092\nBecause, depending on what you wanna do.\n\n354\n00:19:35.092 --> 00:19:39.166\nIf it's something that you're gonna try\nto prosecute, you don't wanna contaminate\n\n355\n00:19:39.166 --> 00:19:41.987\nthe evidence to the point where\nthey can't prosecute now.\n\n356\n00:19:41.987 --> 00:19:42.590\nThey'll say,\n\n357\n00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:46.360\nI'm sorry, we can't prosecute, because\nyou've contaminated all the evidence.\n\n358\n00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.104\nWe have no case and it's never gonna\nmake it through the court system.\n\n359\n00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:51.939\nSo don't try to be the hero, and\n\n360\n00:19:51.939 --> 00:19:57.930\nstart doing your own preliminary\ninvestigation on those laptops.\n\n361\n00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.200\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, is there something,\nI mean that really seems a lot like we say\n\n362\n00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.350\njust in basic network troubleshooting,\nright?\n\n363\n00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.560\nIt's the reason we have\nmulti-tiered help desks, right?\n\n364\n00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.920\nIf I don't know how to do something,\nwe should escalate, right?\n\n365\n00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.755\nAnd just make sure you escalate it to\nsomebody who does have the experience and\n\n366\n00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:16.354\nthe confidence to go along\nwith that to do their job.\n\n367\n00:20:16.354 --> 00:20:19.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly right, I mean, that's\nwhy we're here to get this training.\n\n368\n00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.170\nBut your organization should, and\nif they don't, you will help them.\n\n369\n00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.730\nHave an incident response plan that\ndefines who should be notified,\n\n370\n00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:31.870\nwho should be the first responders, and\nwhat procedures we're going through.\n\n371\n00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:35.230\nAnd what you don't wanna be is,\nyou're studying for it.\n\n372\n00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.510\nYou want to become part of that team,\nand an incident happens.\n\n373\n00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.510\nAnd you think,\nI'm gonna show them how much I know.\n\n374\n00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:45.369\nAnd I'm gonna go in there and\nstart doing some of this,\n\n375\n00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:48.710\nand end up goofing things up.\n\n376\n00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:49.570\nAnd where was I going with that?\n\n377\n00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:54.554\nThere was something I was gonna\nsay when I talked about that.\n\n378\n00:20:54.554 --> 00:20:57.333\nIt made me think of all\nthe TV shows that I watch.\n\n379\n00:20:57.333 --> 00:21:02.479\nAnd, I love all these shows, my girlfriend\ngets mad at me because I'm always\n\n380\n00:21:02.479 --> 00:21:07.645\nthe one that says come one, there is\nnot command identify current user.\n\n381\n00:21:07.645 --> 00:21:12.237\nI saw it on a TV show last night,\nshe goes to access a file, and\n\n382\n00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:16.760\nit says file is locked,\nfile is in use, being downloaded.\n\n383\n00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.910\nI'm like wow,\nthat's a really informative message.\n\n384\n00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:22.770\nAnd then she opens up a terminal and\nsays identify current user.\n\n385\n00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.880\nDoesn't specify what file or anything, and\n\n386\n00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.940\nit just shows the person\nthat's currently accessing it.\n\n387\n00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.352\nAnd then she goes over to their office and\nstarts blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n388\n00:21:31.352 --> 00:21:35.080\nI'm like, they could at least get somebody\nto help them a little bit with their\n\n389\n00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.010\nscripting, make it look\na little bit more realistic.\n\n390\n00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.595\nBut anyway, my point was,\nto that long, drawn out story.\n\n391\n00:21:39.595 --> 00:21:43.265\nIs you see people in these crime shows,\nthey walk into a house,\n\n392\n00:21:43.265 --> 00:21:44.470\nthere's the computer.\n\n393\n00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.810\nAnd they open up their email, and\n\n394\n00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.100\nthey start trying to figure out\nwhat this person emailed last.\n\n395\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.260\nOr they start opening up their browser and\nlooking at their browser history.\n\n396\n00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.320\nThat's not gonna ever, ever,\never happen in the real world, right?\n\n397\n00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.100\nBecause as soon as you do that, you have\ncontaminated all of that evidence, and\n\n398\n00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.460\nit's not gonna be useable,\nthat would never be done.\n\n399\n00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.756\nAnd I know, it's drama, it's TV,\nthey've gotta make it exciting.\n\n400\n00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:08.276\nAnd they don't wanna show the guy\nbagging up the computer and\n\n401\n00:22:08.276 --> 00:22:10.632\nputting in a static proof evidence bag.\n\n402\n00:22:10.632 --> 00:22:13.600\nAnd taking it back to the lab,\nand then duplicating the drive.\n\n403\n00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.000\nThat's not all that exciting and\nthey don't have that much time.\n\n404\n00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.860\nThe main part of the story is\nthe love story that's going\n\n405\n00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.370\non between the criminal and\nthe lawyer or whatever, who knows.\n\n406\n00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.920\nSo the point is, don't look at\nall those TV shows and go, wow,\n\n407\n00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.560\nthat's how they do this,\nno that's not how they do this.\n\n408\n00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.390\nAll right, so back to our forensics kit,\n\n409\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.940\nwe've gone through just about everything\nexcept for documents and forms.\n\n410\n00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.818\nYou're definitely gonna want documents,\nforms.\n\n411\n00:22:36.818 --> 00:22:40.428\nI'm going to jump around a little\nbit on you Wes and go ahead and\n\n412\n00:22:40.428 --> 00:22:44.900\npull up our sample chain of\ncustody which also came from SANS.\n\n413\n00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.810\nSANS is a great resource,\n\n414\n00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:51.202\nthey put out a lot of freely\navailable information and tools.\n\n415\n00:22:51.202 --> 00:22:54.600\nOr not so much tools, but information,\nand reports and things like this\n\n416\n00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.390\nto help you as an organization\nbecome a more secure organization.\n\n417\n00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.970\nTake advantage of that, if you've never\nwritten an incident response plan,\n\n418\n00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:04.040\nhow do you start?\n\n419\n00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.200\nYou go to some place like SANS,\nand you get a template from them.\n\n420\n00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.048\nAnd you take where it says company name,\nand you put your company name in there.\n\n421\n00:23:11.048 --> 00:23:13.971\nAnd you start modifying\nit to fit your needs, but\n\n422\n00:23:13.971 --> 00:23:16.620\nat least you've got a good starting point.\n\n423\n00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.853\nSo this is an example template,\nAnywhere Police Department,\n\n424\n00:23:19.853 --> 00:23:22.054\nEVIDENCE CHAIN OF CUSTODY TRACKING FORM.\n\n425\n00:23:22.054 --> 00:23:25.958\nYou can see where we've put case numbers\nin there, collect this information,\n\n426\n00:23:25.958 --> 00:23:27.180\nchain of custody.\n\n427\n00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.720\nAnd, if you don't know, if you\nhaven't seen any of these crime shows,\n\n428\n00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.280\nare not familiar with what\na chain of custody is.\n\n429\n00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.347\nA chain of custody is\na documentation of evidence and\n\n430\n00:23:36.347 --> 00:23:40.700\nwho's in custodial ownership,\nI guess you could say.\n\n431\n00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.699\nI don't know if that's proper, but\nwho is in control of that evidence.\n\n432\n00:23:44.699 --> 00:23:49.140\nIn other words, when I go to that crime\nscene, if I'm the first responder, And\n\n433\n00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.183\nI'm in this room with the computers,\nthe laptops, whatever it is, and\n\n434\n00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:54.866\nI start bagging up evidence.\n\n435\n00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:59.402\nI put my item number, a date and\na time, who I am, and I sign it.\n\n436\n00:23:59.402 --> 00:24:04.178\nI am now responsible for that evidence and\nmaking sure that it is maintained,\n\n437\n00:24:04.178 --> 00:24:06.500\npreserved, not modified.\n\n438\n00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.788\nIf I wanna get back to the lab and I hand\nthat off to the people that are actually\n\n439\n00:24:10.788 --> 00:24:13.520\ngonna do the work with it,\nI watch them sign it.\n\n440\n00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.800\nThey sign off on it, saying they\nare now taking custody from me.\n\n441\n00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.270\nI no longer have responsibility\nover that evidence.\n\n442\n00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.490\nThey do, right?\n\n443\n00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:22.610\nThat's a chain of custody.\n\n444\n00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:26.040\nAnd if I go into court and\nthere's gaps in that chain of custody,\n\n445\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:31.640\nhey, I collected this at 3 PM,\n8 AM the next day I turned it into work.\n\n446\n00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.120\nWhere was it in the meantime?\n\n447\n00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.460\nWas it in my car in my driveway?\n\n448\n00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.270\nCould anybody else have\ngotten into my car?\n\n449\n00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.042\nWho else has keys to my car?\n\n450\n00:24:39.042 --> 00:24:40.374\nSo really your wife\ncould have got in there.\n\n451\n00:24:40.374 --> 00:24:41.500\nYour kids could have got in there.\n\n452\n00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.004\nYour dog could have got in there,\nthings like that.\n\n453\n00:24:44.004 --> 00:24:45.340\nI mean, it's gonna ruin the evidence.\n\n454\n00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.972\nSo keeping a chain of custody,\na very important part of doing\n\n455\n00:24:49.972 --> 00:24:54.020\nan incident response.\n\n456\n00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:57.630\nFinal disposal, what are we gonna do\nwith the evidence once it's done?\n\n457\n00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.320\nDoes it go back to the original owner?\n\n458\n00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.900\nDoes it go, does it get destroyed?\n\n459\n00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:07.770\nDoes it stock in lock or stay in storage,\nin case there's appeals and\n\n460\n00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.490\nthings like that?\n\n461\n00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:11.430\nSo a very good little form to have,\nall right.\n\n462\n00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.570\nAnd there's others that we'll\ntalk about kind of as we go.\n\n463\n00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:20.050\nIn fact, an incident response plan is\nthe next one I want to talk about.\n\n464\n00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:24.630\nAnd I believe I've got that, SANS calls\nthis one a security response plan.\n\n465\n00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.274\nBut this is a sample of one, an overview.\n\n466\n00:25:29.274 --> 00:25:33.584\nAnd anytime time you look at policies, you\ntypically have an overview section, and\n\n467\n00:25:33.584 --> 00:25:35.590\nthen a purpose and a scope.\n\n468\n00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.850\nWhich is telling me, hey, what this\ndocument is about, what it's supposed to\n\n469\n00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:44.990\ndo, who it should apply to, the scope,\nand then the policy itself.\n\n470\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:49.795\nAnd on an incident response plan,\nwe will have, let's see if I can find.\n\n471\n00:25:49.795 --> 00:25:54.710\nYeah, not a lot to that, so\nbasically, you've got your policy.\n\n472\n00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.193\nLet me zoom in, sorry,\nI forgot to zoom in there.\n\n473\n00:25:57.193 --> 00:26:00.847\nAnd service or product description,\n\n474\n00:26:00.847 --> 00:26:05.710\ncontact information, triage, well,\nthe steps that are going to be taken.\n\n475\n00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.130\nObviously, it's going to be a lot longer\nonce you put your own information in here.\n\n476\n00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:14.110\nThey're just giving you guidelines\non how to fill one of these out,\n\n477\n00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:20.600\nidentified mitigations and testing,\nmitigation remediation timelines,\n\n478\n00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:25.435\nhow to make sure we maintain compliance\nand measure that, compliance,\n\n479\n00:26:25.435 --> 00:26:29.530\nnon-compliance, what happens\nif we're out of compliance.\n\n480\n00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:34.870\nAny business found to have violated\nmay be subject to delays in service,\n\n481\n00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:36.040\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n482\n00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.650\nBut these are the kind of things that\nwe do wanna draw up ahead of time.\n\n483\n00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.270\nThis can't be done,\nwell, shouldn't be done.\n\n484\n00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:47.820\nI won't say can't,\nshouldn't be done during an incident.\n\n485\n00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.320\nYou wanna have all of this planned out.\n\n486\n00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:54.810\nBecause when the incident occurs,\npeople are not gonna be thinking clearly.\n\n487\n00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:55.780\nThat's a problem.\n\n488\n00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.280\nPeople get excited,\npeople make knee jerk reactions.\n\n489\n00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:05.165\nAnd things don't go as smoothly as\nthey would have, if we had a plan,\n\n490\n00:27:05.165 --> 00:27:10.340\nif we had practiced that plan over and\nover until we had it down pat.\n\n491\n00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.650\nKnew what our role was within the plan,\nknew what our responsibilities,\n\n492\n00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.540\nexpectations were, knew who we were\nsupposed to report to, notify,\n\n493\n00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.050\nwhat we were supposed to collect,\nall of that information goes in there.\n\n494\n00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.800\n&gt;&gt; Mike, that sounds a lot like I'm\nhearing some similarities between\n\n495\n00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.220\nthings like disaster recovery policies and\nplans, right.\n\n496\n00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.434\nWe wanna know what has to go on first,\nrather than waiting for it to happen and\n\n497\n00:27:28.434 --> 00:27:30.357\nthen trying to figure\nit out the last second.\n\n498\n00:27:30.357 --> 00:27:33.510\nSo it sounds like this was really,\nreally running close to in line.\n\n499\n00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.540\nYou wanna know where everything is,\nand have everything in place.\n\n500\n00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.040\nSo that when things do go hectic,\n\n501\n00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.740\nyou don't have to think\nabout it ahead of time.\n\n502\n00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.820\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nit's exactly the same thing.\n\n503\n00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.650\nThat's a great point.\n\n504\n00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.830\nWhen you do your disaster recovery plans,\nyou do them ahead of time.\n\n505\n00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.396\nYou test them, and\nyou repeatedly test them, right?\n\n506\n00:27:49.396 --> 00:27:50.770\nYou don't do it just once.\n\n507\n00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.610\nPeriodically go back and test it,\nrevise it, because things change.\n\n508\n00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:57.590\nContact points change, and I need to know.\n\n509\n00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.800\nIf I don't ever test it, I'm not going to\nknow if I missed anything in my policy,\n\n510\n00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.500\nin my incident response plan.\n\n511\n00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.920\nHey look,\nwe forgot to notify the CEO, whoops.\n\n512\n00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.600\nThat's probably not gonna be good.\n\n513\n00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:14.090\nOr we forgot to include the phone numbers\nfor the cyber crime task force for\n\n514\n00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.570\nthe local police, things like that.\n\n515\n00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.934\nSo by testing it, it gives you a chances\nto go through and work out any kinks.\n\n516\n00:28:19.934 --> 00:28:23.310\nKinda iron it out a little bit,\nupdate it if necessary,\n\n517\n00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:27.000\nmodify it as our systems and\nour needs change.\n\n518\n00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.490\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\nthat's a lot of great information.\n\n519\n00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:29.260\nI'll tell you what though,\n\n520\n00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.870\nI'm looking a list of bullet points\nhere and I know he is not done yet.\n\n521\n00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.530\nBut we're gonna have to be done for\nthis episode unfortunately,\n\n522\n00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.280\nbecause it looks like we\nare running out of time.\n\n523\n00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.245\nMike, do you got anything else\nyou'd like to throw in this one?\n\n524\n00:28:39.245 --> 00:28:40.774\nAre we gonna give them\nthe Mike cliffhanger, or\n\n525\n00:28:40.774 --> 00:28:42.170\nmaybe save it for a part two?\n\n526\n00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.870\n&gt;&gt; Well, I tell you, Wes,\nwe don't have that much more.\n\n527\n00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.580\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and\nrun a little long, that's okay.\n\n528\n00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.215\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do that.\n\n529\n00:28:48.215 --> 00:28:50.615\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Because again,\nI'm not gonna demo anything just yet.\n\n530\n00:28:50.615 --> 00:28:53.890\nI'm gonna save that towards the end\nwhen we get into the last part of\n\n531\n00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:54.780\nthe objectives.\n\n532\n00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.483\nWhen we start calling out\nthe individual tools, I'll go back and\n\n533\n00:28:57.483 --> 00:28:59.850\ntie it back in to what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n534\n00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:03.400\nCuz really, the only thing we have left\nto talk about, I know my list looks long.\n\n535\n00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.190\nBut call list, escalation list,\nthese are going to be important.\n\n536\n00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:11.870\nThis is who you notify, should be\npart of our incident response plan.\n\n537\n00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.640\nShould be part of our\nforensics kit as well.\n\n538\n00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.150\nWho do I notify when I\nsuspect an incident occurs?\n\n539\n00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:20.310\nI was teasing about the CEO,\n\n540\n00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:25.030\nthe CEO is probably not going\nto be on that initial call list.\n\n541\n00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.676\nBecause until we know there has\nbeen a breach or an incident, and\n\n542\n00:29:28.676 --> 00:29:32.795\nthat it's not just spam, or\nsomething broke, or something like that,\n\n543\n00:29:32.795 --> 00:29:35.244\nwe're probably not going to notify them.\n\n544\n00:29:35.244 --> 00:29:38.170\nBut we do have our incident response\nteam that we need to notify.\n\n545\n00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:42.880\nWe probably notify our CISO,\nour chief information security officer.\n\n546\n00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.220\nOr maybe we don't,\nmaybe we notify somebody under him or her.\n\n547\n00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.441\nAnd then if they determine necessary,\nthey notify that person.\n\n548\n00:29:49.441 --> 00:29:53.502\nSo the call list is all the numbers and\nthe priorities of things I need to,\n\n549\n00:29:53.502 --> 00:29:55.040\npeople I need to notify.\n\n550\n00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:01.665\nIt can also be vendor information as well,\nwhen we talk about that call list.\n\n551\n00:30:01.665 --> 00:30:06.447\nBecause if there is an incident and\nI don't have access to my own information,\n\n552\n00:30:06.447 --> 00:30:11.155\nhow do I know the numbers for where our\nbackup data is stored if I can't get into\n\n553\n00:30:11.155 --> 00:30:14.965\nthe office,\nif I can't get access to my information?\n\n554\n00:30:14.965 --> 00:30:17.415\nThey don't have Rolodexes\nthat much anymore.\n\n555\n00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:19.195\nI know some of you are like,\nwhat the heck's a Rolodex?\n\n556\n00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.988\nUse your search engine, find out.\n\n557\n00:30:21.988 --> 00:30:24.640\nAnd you go, wow he really is old!\n\n558\n00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.300\nBut everything, we might not have access.\n\n559\n00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.830\nI don't have my contacts in my phone and\nhow do I have that number?\n\n560\n00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:34.450\nSo making sure you have got\nthat information somewhere.\n\n561\n00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:38.297\nWhen they talk about a forensics\ninvestigation suite, again,\n\n562\n00:30:38.297 --> 00:30:41.590\nwe'll talk about some\nspecific tools later on.\n\n563\n00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:45.050\nBut we're gonna need imaging utilities,\nbecause I need to duplicate media.\n\n564\n00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.850\nSo as I talked about earlier,\nwe need to duplicate that so\n\n565\n00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.050\nwe can do our analysis on it.\n\n566\n00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.480\nWe never work with the original media.\n\n567\n00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.410\nYou need analysis utilities.\n\n568\n00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.990\nOnce I've done that memory scrape,\nit's not human-readable, right?\n\n569\n00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.300\nI've gotta somehow work\nwith that information.\n\n570\n00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:03.720\nSo we'll need analysis tools to\ndecode that information for us.\n\n571\n00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.300\nUnless you're like the Matrix, and\n\n572\n00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.600\nyou can read the hex as it's\nflowing across your screen.\n\n573\n00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.250\nA chain of custody, we talked about that.\n\n574\n00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.970\nThat needs to be in there.\n\n575\n00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:17.156\nHashing utilities, when I make those\nduplications of the media, I run both\n\n576\n00:31:17.156 --> 00:31:22.356\nof them through a hashing algorithm\nto verify they're identical, right.\n\n577\n00:31:22.356 --> 00:31:25.540\nI'm sure you know about hashing\nalgorithms at this point.\n\n578\n00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.160\nIf you don't, a quick rehash.\n\n579\n00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.680\nA hashing algorithm is a one-way\n\n580\n00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.210\nencryption that generates a hash\nvalue when you run data through it.\n\n581\n00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:37.250\nSo you run that hard drive\nthrough a hashing algorithm and\n\n582\n00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.780\nit generates an output.\n\n583\n00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.761\nEvery time you run that hard drive\nthrough that hashing algorithm,\n\n584\n00:31:41.761 --> 00:31:44.859\nit should generate the exact same\noutput if it hasn't been modified.\n\n585\n00:31:44.859 --> 00:31:48.777\nModify one little thing, and it's\ngonna generate a different hash value.\n\n586\n00:31:48.777 --> 00:31:52.118\nSo when I take my copy, and\nI run it through the hashing algorithm,\n\n587\n00:31:52.118 --> 00:31:55.718\nThey'd better make identical hash values,\nor something went wrong.\n\n588\n00:31:55.718 --> 00:31:58.836\nSo we need those kind of things to do,\nto verify hard drives or\n\n589\n00:31:58.836 --> 00:32:03.280\nverify individual files integrity,\nthat we haven't modified those.\n\n590\n00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.810\nOS and process analysis,\nwe can go through and see what's running.\n\n591\n00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:11.799\nWhat hidden things are running that might\nare showing up in your nice little GUI\n\n592\n00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:12.790\ntask manager?\n\n593\n00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.523\nAnd we need mobile device forensics.\n\n594\n00:32:14.523 --> 00:32:19.500\nThere's a whole, not brand new but\na big expanding area of doing forensics\n\n595\n00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.687\non mobile devices where we're\ngonna need a little bit of that,\n\n596\n00:32:23.687 --> 00:32:27.953\nespecially if we have company\nissued phones or mobile devices.\n\n597\n00:32:27.953 --> 00:32:30.680\nYou need to be able to investigate those.\n\n598\n00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:36.363\nPassword crackers, we'll take a look later\non at something like LOphtCrack, or Cain &amp;\n\n599\n00:32:36.363 --> 00:32:41.693\nAbel, or John the Ripper, several password\ncrackers, and you should have many.\n\n600\n00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:46.555\nYou should have some to do online password\ncracking against maybe websites or\n\n601\n00:32:46.555 --> 00:32:51.214\nif you dump hashes, how are you're\ngonna try and crack those passwords?\n\n602\n00:32:51.214 --> 00:32:55.915\nI'm trying to get access to a person's\nsystem, trying to get access to encrypted\n\n603\n00:32:55.915 --> 00:32:59.267\nfiles, or that are password-protected,\nI should say.\n\n604\n00:32:59.267 --> 00:33:03.811\nAnd log viewers,\ncryptography tools, log viewers,\n\n605\n00:33:03.811 --> 00:33:08.967\nwe'll talk about seam logs,\nseam systems in a little while.\n\n606\n00:33:08.967 --> 00:33:10.796\nBut being able to crunch log data,\n\n607\n00:33:10.796 --> 00:33:14.394\ncorrelate that data across different\nsystems so I can see the attack\n\n608\n00:33:14.394 --> 00:33:18.071\nas it works its way through the network\ngonna be very important to us.\n\n609\n00:33:18.071 --> 00:33:21.596\nSo all of those really should be\na part of our kit, and I'll break\n\n610\n00:33:21.596 --> 00:33:25.985\ndown the actual individual tools,\nlike I said, in some future episodes here.\n\n611\n00:33:25.985 --> 00:33:29.440\nAnd that Wes, I think does\nfinish up our forensics tools.\n\n612\n00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that was a great job.\n\n613\n00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.070\nI didn't think he was gonna do it,\nbut man he can managed to do it.\n\n614\n00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.400\nMike did a real great job.\n\n615\n00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.730\nBut it does look like as you guys already\nknow we've expended our minutes for\n\n616\n00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:39.400\nthis episode.\n\n617\n00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.969\nBut before we do, Mike, you got any final\nwords maybe you'd like to impart to our\n\n618\n00:33:42.969 --> 00:33:45.609\nviewers when it comes to things\nlike your forensics tools?\n\n619\n00:33:45.609 --> 00:33:49.078\n&gt;&gt; No, but I will tell you what a Rolodex\nis, just in case you don't know.\n\n620\n00:33:49.078 --> 00:33:52.573\nIt was an old system for keeping phone\nnumbers and contact information.\n\n621\n00:33:52.573 --> 00:33:54.330\nIt had a little dial on the side.\n\n622\n00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.000\nAnd it was these little tiny cards, and\n\n623\n00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.690\nas you turned it, the cards flipped\nlike one of those clocks where\n\n624\n00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.670\nthe little numbers in half fold in half\nand flip over, that was a Rolodex.\n\n625\n00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:04.861\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't own a watch.\n\n626\n00:34:04.861 --> 00:34:08.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, that being said.\n\n627\n00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:12.082\nLooks like it is time to sign out for\nthis one here at ITProTV.\n\n628\n00:34:12.082 --> 00:34:15.789\nWe do appreciate your watching and as\nalways Mike, we appreciate you being here.\n\n629\n00:34:15.789 --> 00:34:18.684\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n630\n00:34:18.684 --> 00:34:19.456\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n631\n00:34:19.456 --> 00:34:22.157\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n632\n00:34:22.157 --> 00:34:28.225\n[MUSIC]\n\n633\n00:34:28.225 --> 00:34:31.071\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.267\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:11.011\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.440\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another great\nepisode, here in the ITPRO.TV studios.\n\n6\n00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.640\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.861\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:21.643\nwe're continuing through our series\nin CompTIA's Cybersecurity Analyst+.\n\n9\n00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:24.440\nAnd joining us back in the studios\nagain is Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.740\nMike, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.160\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.020\nThanks for having me back,\n\n13\n00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.520\nexcited as always to be continuing on with\nour Cybersecurity Analyst+ from CompTIA.\n\n14\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.850\nThis one, we're hitting 3.3,\ncommunication process is our objective.\n\n15\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.819\nAnd we wanna talk about the importance of\ncommunication during the incident response\n\n16\n00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:43.447\nprocess.\n\n17\n00:00:43.447 --> 00:00:47.030\nAnd I've already hinted at it\na little bit in a previous episode.\n\n18\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.350\nBut the communication,\n\n19\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.110\nit is an extremely important part\nof the incident response process.\n\n20\n00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.780\nBecause we need to make sure that\neverybody's aware of what is going on.\n\n21\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.000\nWell, I shouldn't use the word everybody.\n\n22\n00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.820\nWhen I say everybody, I know what I mean,\n\n23\n00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.605\nbut let me make sure you\nguys know what I mean.\n\n24\n00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:08.730\nCuz when I say everybody, and everybody\nthat should be notified has been notified.\n\n25\n00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.680\nAnd that can change depending\non the type of incident, or\n\n26\n00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.960\nwhere we're at in\nthe incident response plan.\n\n27\n00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.020\nBut knowing who to contact,\n\n28\n00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.760\nwho needs to be told, having all of that\nlaid out ahead of time is very important.\n\n29\n00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.210\nSo that during the incident there\nis no question, we know exactly who\n\n30\n00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.979\nshould be notified, and when, and\nwhat information they need to be given.\n\n31\n00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.330\nSo when we look at it, who should\nbe included in the communication?\n\n32\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.670\nAnd they've go a list, and\nwe'll kinda talk with each one.\n\n33\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.855\nMaybe not in the exact order, but we will\ntalk about stakeholders in general, right?\n\n34\n00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:46.105\nStakeholders, anybody that has\na vested interest in the organization.\n\n35\n00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:51.730\nSo that includes from the CEO all\nthe way down to the front desk person,\n\n36\n00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.940\nor all your employees.\n\n37\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.870\nIt also includes your customers, right?\n\n38\n00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.900\nThey've bought your product, they're\na stakeholder in your organization.\n\n39\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.270\nSo when they say stakeholders,\nit doesn't mean that we go out and\n\n40\n00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420\nnotify everybody that's\never bought our product.\n\n41\n00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.660\nHey, we had a breach on someone's laptop,\nand\n\n42\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.850\nsome of the data might\nhave been compromised.\n\n43\n00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.350\nThat's not what they mean there.\n\n44\n00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.450\nCertain key stakeholder need to be\nnotified in the event of an incident,\n\n45\n00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.080\nwho are those?\n\n46\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.030\nWell, again,\ndepending on your organization,\n\n47\n00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.660\nthere is no one answer fits all.\n\n48\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.920\nBut there are some general guidelines\nthat we can throw out there,\n\n49\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.740\nand that we should be familiar with.\n\n50\n00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.990\nManagement in general should be notified.\n\n51\n00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.030\nBut I don't like the way\nthey just say management,\n\n52\n00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.400\nbecause organizations have\ndifferent levels of management.\n\n53\n00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.307\nSometimes we throw that title around\njust to make people feel good.\n\n54\n00:02:40.307 --> 00:02:41.341\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n55\n00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:44.340\nBut not everybody in\nmanagement needs to know.\n\n56\n00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.393\nSo when we look at it,\n\n57\n00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:48.793\nwe really wanna think about the chief\ninformation officer, right?\n\n58\n00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:52.641\nWhoever that person is, they should\nbe notified, because this is their\n\n59\n00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:56.990\nresponsibility, in the end,\nif they are the chief information officer.\n\n60\n00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.366\nAnd we've got a data breach and\nthere is a possible exfiltration, or\n\n61\n00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:04.510\nmodification, or deletion of data, right?\n\n62\n00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.173\nI think the chief information officer\nwould definitely wanna know, and\n\n63\n00:03:07.173 --> 00:03:08.536\nthat's an important one to notify.\n\n64\n00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:11.704\nIf we have a CISO,\na chief information security officer,\n\n65\n00:03:11.704 --> 00:03:13.930\nthey're gonna be notified.\n\n66\n00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.576\nYour incident response team,\n\n67\n00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:18.495\nthey're probably one of\nthe first people you notify.\n\n68\n00:03:18.495 --> 00:03:22.959\nBecause if somebody discovers a laptop's\nbeen compromised, see something going on\n\n69\n00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.240\nthat shouldn't be going on, they're\ngonna notify the incident response team.\n\n70\n00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.630\nSo this list is not in any\nparticular order of notification,\n\n71\n00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.480\njust to be clear on that.\n\n72\n00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.220\nSo incident response team,\n\n73\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.330\nwho are the people that have been\ndesignated to respond to incidents?\n\n74\n00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.903\nThat actually go down there physically and\ncordon off the area,\n\n75\n00:03:41.903 --> 00:03:46.348\nand start documenting, and taking\nthe photos, and collecting the evidence.\n\n76\n00:03:46.348 --> 00:03:48.385\nThose people are gonna\nneed to be notified.\n\n77\n00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:52.070\nAnd I always talk about it, or\na lot of times I end up talking about it,\n\n78\n00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.660\nlike the incident occurred\nin the office next door.\n\n79\n00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.570\nThat very well could be at\nsomebody's house, right?\n\n80\n00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.196\nIf they're working from home,\nwe might have to go out there and\n\n81\n00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:04.089\ndo a incident response at their house.\n\n82\n00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.102\nSo it's not just in the office building.\n\n83\n00:04:06.102 --> 00:04:10.207\n[COUGH] External incident response teams,\nif applicable.\n\n84\n00:04:10.207 --> 00:04:14.242\nYou might not have the resources to\nmaintain an incidence response team, and\n\n85\n00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:17.610\nwe'll come back to that\nconcept here in a little bit.\n\n86\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.405\nBut there are third parties that you\ncan hire as an incident response team.\n\n87\n00:04:21.405 --> 00:04:24.000\nSo if you've done that,\nthen you're gonna need to notify them.\n\n88\n00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.440\nHey, a breach has occurred, we need your\npeople over here as soon as possible.\n\n89\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.600\nThe system owner, you wanna to\nmake sure that they're notified.\n\n90\n00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.920\nIf I suspect that Wes' laptop has been\ncompromised, I need to notify Wes.\n\n91\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.780\nBecause Wes needs to know,\ndon't touch anything on your laptop.\n\n92\n00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.593\nDon't be at home and trying to remote into\nyour system to get some files you forgot,\n\n93\n00:04:43.593 --> 00:04:46.915\nthat you wanted to look at over\nthe weekend while we're doing an incident\n\n94\n00:04:46.915 --> 00:04:48.508\nresponse on your laptop, right?\n\n95\n00:04:48.508 --> 00:04:52.550\nOr doing forensic investigation,\nso notifying the system owner.\n\n96\n00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.700\nIf it involves employees,\nthen we might have to get HR involved.\n\n97\n00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.510\nBecause they're gonna have to work with\nthe actual employee, see what's happening,\n\n98\n00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.500\ntalk about,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n99\n00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.380\nAdministrative actions against\nthe employee, potentially,\n\n100\n00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.050\ndepending on what kind of breach this is.\n\n101\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.850\nBut HR needs to be involved to\nmake sure that we're following\n\n102\n00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.610\nall the regulations there, right?\n\n103\n00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.061\nThey have certain rights,\nthey're not guilty until proven, so\n\n104\n00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:24.400\nwe've gotta make sure we're\nfollowing the law there.\n\n105\n00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.180\nGet HR involved if this\ninvolves employees.\n\n106\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.840\nIf you have a legal department,\nyou need to notify them,\n\n107\n00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.870\nespecially if there's potential\nlegal ramifications to the breach.\n\n108\n00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.360\nIf I think customer credit card\ninformation has been exfiltrated,\n\n109\n00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.432\nhas been obtained by these attackers,\nwell,\n\n110\n00:05:41.432 --> 00:05:46.416\nthen there's definitely gonna be some\npotential legal liability there.\n\n111\n00:05:46.416 --> 00:05:50.972\nAnd I'm gonna wanna get my legal team\ninvolved early on, to make sure that we're\n\n112\n00:05:50.972 --> 00:05:54.870\ndoing everything we need to do in\norder to protect our organization.\n\n113\n00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.198\nProtect our customers, and\nminimize the legal ramifications and\n\n114\n00:05:59.198 --> 00:06:00.980\nthe legal outcome of this.\n\n115\n00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.980\nThe lawsuits that might occur,\nthings like that.\n\n116\n00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.320\nGetting them involved early is\na lot better than going to them\n\n117\n00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.060\nwell after the fact and say,\nhey look, we might have goofed up.\n\n118\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.910\nThis is what we did,\ncan you fix it for us?\n\n119\n00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:15.730\nNot gonna be good.\n\n120\n00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:24.180\nMarketing, public affairs, if it generates\nany type of publicity, if I can say that.\n\n121\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.930\nYou might think, wait, really?\n\n122\n00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.650\nYeah, you really wanna have one or a set\nof people, if you're a small organization.\n\n123\n00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.240\nOr if you're a larger organization,\nyou might have PR people, right?\n\n124\n00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.410\nYou might have those marketing public\naffairs people that are responsible for\n\n125\n00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.110\ntalking in the news, generating articles,\nblogs, what have you.\n\n126\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.110\nMaybe that's who you use,\nif you're not that big and\n\n127\n00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.950\nyou don't have an actual PR department.\n\n128\n00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.027\nMaybe you've got somebody in\nthe organization that's well-spoken,\n\n129\n00:06:55.027 --> 00:06:58.585\nthat presents well,\nthat you wanna pick as your media person.\n\n130\n00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:02.800\nOr the one that you're gonna use to\ndisseminate information out to the public.\n\n131\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.280\nBut you typically wanna have one, right?\n\n132\n00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.000\nAnd when I say one, I don't mean one\nindividual, there could be a team of them.\n\n133\n00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.250\nIn case one of the guys\nis taking the day off,\n\n134\n00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.210\nthe other person can step in,\nI understand that.\n\n135\n00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:18.340\nBut you wanna have a defined person or set\nof people that are responsible for this.\n\n136\n00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.310\nBecause they're gonna be hopefully good\nat it, maybe possibly trained at it.\n\n137\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.530\nAnd we can give them the information,\nand they can present it to the public.\n\n138\n00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:31.157\nWhat you don't want is just random\nemployees talking to the news cameras,\n\n139\n00:07:31.157 --> 00:07:32.063\nall right?\n\n140\n00:07:32.063 --> 00:07:34.749\nAnd going, my gosh,\nI don't know what happened,\n\n141\n00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:36.930\nI think all of our customer\ndata is out there.\n\n142\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.440\nThey've got credit cards, it's crazy,\nI don't what we're gonna do.\n\n143\n00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.410\nThat is not what you wanna present, right?\n\n144\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.540\nYou wanna make it calm,\ncollected, organized.\n\n145\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.793\nOnly giving out the information\nthat's necessary at the time, or\n\n146\n00:07:49.793 --> 00:07:51.486\nthat's legally required of you.\n\n147\n00:07:51.486 --> 00:07:55.331\nAnd having somebody that's in charge\nof that, and takes care of that,\n\n148\n00:07:55.331 --> 00:07:56.431\nis really crucial.\n\n149\n00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:59.876\nLike I said, during an incident,\ndepending on why type of incident it is,\n\n150\n00:07:59.876 --> 00:08:01.534\npeople aren't thinking clearly.\n\n151\n00:08:01.534 --> 00:08:03.087\nPeople are making knee-jerk reactions.\n\n152\n00:08:03.087 --> 00:08:07.710\nThey might spew off information\nthat's really not necessary or\n\n153\n00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.140\nis not appropriate to be\ngiven out at that time.\n\n154\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.830\nLaw enforcement, if we suspect this is an\noutside or an inside or internal attack.\n\n155\n00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.560\nAre we going to attempt to prosecute?\n\n156\n00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.580\nIf so, we might want to get\nlaw enforcement involved.\n\n157\n00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.750\nThere are several organizations\nhere in the States, and\n\n158\n00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.940\nI know there's others around the world,\nthat will help organizations, right?\n\n159\n00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.400\nLast week, when I was at RSA,\nI'm sitting in a meeting and\n\n160\n00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.190\nthere's a gentleman with\nthe Secret Service.\n\n161\n00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.010\nAnd he's like, many organizations\ndon't know that they can call us.\n\n162\n00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.870\nAnd we can help them.\n\n163\n00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.350\nWe can put our resources behind them,\ntrying to figure out what happened.\n\n164\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.990\nSo we have several organizations\nhere in the States.\n\n165\n00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:48.880\nA lot of local law enforcement agencies\nnow have cyber crime divisions\n\n166\n00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.060\nthat are trained.\n\n167\n00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.540\nAnd have the resources and\n\n168\n00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.530\nthe tools necessary to perform\na really good, thorough investigation.\n\n169\n00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.760\nSo it might appropriate to bring them in.\n\n170\n00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.530\nAnd there's nothing wrong with\nunderstanding your limitations and\n\n171\n00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.120\ntaking advantage of other resources\nthat are available to you, right?\n\n172\n00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.700\nI don't wanna goof things up to\nthe point where we now can't prosecute,\n\n173\n00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.890\nwhen if I would've sucked up my pride,\ncalled some external people to come in and\n\n174\n00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.250\nhelp me,\nmaybe I could've done something, right?\n\n175\n00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.911\nBut if I was too proud,\nI know I can do this,\n\n176\n00:09:21.911 --> 00:09:26.030\nend up contaminating evidence, and\nnever be able to find out who did it, or\n\n177\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.700\neven if I did, I can't prosecute,\nnot gonna make me happy.\n\n178\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.560\nSo, take advantage of that.\n\n179\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.150\nUS Cert, the computer emergency readiness\nteam, is another one that you can call.\n\n180\n00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.530\nThe FBI has divisions just about\neverywhere in the States where you can\n\n181\n00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.680\ncontact them and say look,\n\n182\n00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.490\nI believe this is a breach that\nmight have violated federal law.\n\n183\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.300\nCan you send personnel,\ncan you help us out?\n\n184\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.690\nAnd they'll at least give you guidance,\nright?\n\n185\n00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.650\nEven if they don't offer assistance,\nthey might tell you who you can call or\n\n186\n00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.880\ngive you some guidance,\nlend a little bit of experience and\n\n187\n00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.680\nexpertise to your situation.\n\n188\n00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.290\nSo it's good to know those\npeople ahead of time, honestly.\n\n189\n00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.760\nIf you are part of your incident response\nteam or if you're higher up on the C\n\n190\n00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.590\nlevels, you might wanna make contacts\nwith some of those people ahead of time.\n\n191\n00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:16.800\nSo you know who to call in the event\nthat a incident occurs and\n\n192\n00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.310\nnot have to go through the operator and\ntry to figure out who the best person is.\n\n193\n00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.220\nWell they're out to lunch, or\n\n194\n00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.170\nthat's not the person you\nneed is not here, blah, blah.\n\n195\n00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.320\nThat kind of thing.\n\n196\n00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.110\n&gt;&gt; I can only imagine, Mike, that this\njust goes with proper documentation.\n\n197\n00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.560\nWe always say that do\nI document everything?\n\n198\n00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.980\nYou better believe it.\n\n199\n00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.820\nNo, no, no, I'm just kidding.\n\n200\n00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.850\nBut with documentation with\n\n201\n00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.510\npreparation we can be a lot more prepared\nespecially when an incident happens.\n\n202\n00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.960\nNow I know the episode is pretty\nmuch the communication process.\n\n203\n00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.090\nMike can we maybe explain some examples of\njust a general purpose, why do we need,\n\n204\n00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.255\nwe always talk about communication is so\nimportant, can you give us some examples?\n\n205\n00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:56.670\n&gt;&gt; Sure, when we talk about it we wanna\nmake sure that the reason we're doing all\n\n206\n00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.225\nthis reason we're generating these\nlists of people we need to contact,\n\n207\n00:11:00.225 --> 00:11:05.060\nmaking sure that we have their information\nso that we can do it quickly and\n\n208\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.560\neasily in the event of an incident.\n\n209\n00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.840\nBut we also want to remember how we're\ncommunicating with those people.\n\n210\n00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.780\nBecause if there's been a breach, right,\nif we're worried that our network has\n\n211\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.970\nbeen comprised, we don't know did they\ncome in and smash and grab and leave?\n\n212\n00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.000\nAre they still in there or\nwhat's been compromised?\n\n213\n00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.140\nWhat is the scope of the incident?\n\n214\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.980\nUntil we determine that, we have to assume\nthat everything is compromised, right?\n\n215\n00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.970\nI cannot trust my email\nsystem at this point.\n\n216\n00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:39.110\nWe need to make sure that we use out\nof band communication when possible.\n\n217\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.790\nThis means, maybe not even using\nthe phone, maybe using paper memos, right?\n\n218\n00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.940\nTaking a note, and saying hey, take this\nover to Wes in the other building so\n\n219\n00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.080\nhe knows what's going on.\n\n220\n00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.340\nOr bring this to our PR person so\nthey have information that they can use\n\n221\n00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.470\nwhen they go talk to the news\ncameras that are on the way and\n\n222\n00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.680\ngonna be here in five minutes.\n\n223\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.660\nSo using out of band communication,\nphysically going and\n\n224\n00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.220\ntalking to somebody, right, taking\nthe time to get up out of your desk and\n\n225\n00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.730\ngo down there and talk to them because\nI don't know what's being compromised.\n\n226\n00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:11.730\nThat's really the key there is using\nout of band methods when possible.\n\n227\n00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.430\nLimit your communications\nto trusted parties.\n\n228\n00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:19.210\nAnd again, we wanna make sure that we\nget the information out to the people\n\n229\n00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.140\nthat need it.\n\n230\n00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.850\nBut those that don't need it,\nwe don't want them with the information,\n\n231\n00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:27.620\nbecause they can go and give the\ninformation to more inappropriate people,\n\n232\n00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.820\nor people that shouldn't\nhave the information.\n\n233\n00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.640\nThey leak it out.\n\n234\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.410\nWe see this in the news all the time.\n\n235\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.890\nAnonymous source tells us,\ninside this organization, they've lost all\n\n236\n00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.690\nkinds of credit cards and that gets on\nthe news and where did that come from?\n\n237\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.320\nWhere did they find that information out?\n\n238\n00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.070\nWell, because I happened to tell Wes,\nwho told his friend,\n\n239\n00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.270\nwho told her girlfriend and\nit just got out.\n\n240\n00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.070\nSo making sure that we limit\nthe communications to trusted parties,\n\n241\n00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.070\nuse out of band methods.\n\n242\n00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:59.920\nWe also have to think about what\nregulatory requirements, governmental\n\n243\n00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.050\nrequirements are there for information\nthat we need to make available.\n\n244\n00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.810\nLike I told you the other day\nabout the medical facility,\n\n245\n00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:14.210\nthat ended up with a $5.5 million\nHIPAA fine because of violations.\n\n246\n00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.255\nWell a good chunk of that fine,\nthere were lots of violations and\n\n247\n00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:22.080\nHIPAA does a per violation so\nevery name that you've, or bit of\n\n248\n00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.070\nPII that's leaked out or PHI just leaked\nout is a fine and they add up really\n\n249\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:31.050\nquickly when you're talking about 100,000\nrecords or whatever the case may be.\n\n250\n00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.420\nBut also part of their fine was the fact\nthat they didn't follow procedure, they\n\n251\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:40.850\ndid not notify people in a timely fashion\nthat the breachs had occurred, all right?\n\n252\n00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.910\nI think one of the other, I can't remember\nthe other organization did the same thing,\n\n253\n00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:50.430\nit was a months or years later before\nthey actually gave that information out,\n\n254\n00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:54.920\nand that's a violation of some of\nour regulations here in the US.\n\n255\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.130\n&gt;&gt; Mike, how about the red phone?\n\n256\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.060\nNow I'm sure he's probably saying well,\nwait a second.\n\n257\n00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.465\nYou can only communicate over red phones.\n\n258\n00:13:59.465 --> 00:14:00.815\nThat's not what I mean in context.\n\n259\n00:14:00.815 --> 00:14:04.604\nHow about something that presidential\nphone or when we say is this line secure?\n\n260\n00:14:04.604 --> 00:14:08.205\nOkay we can communicate what's going on,\nthings like that figuratively speaking.\n\n261\n00:14:08.205 --> 00:14:09.255\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you definitely could.\n\n262\n00:14:09.255 --> 00:14:12.795\nI don't know a military organizations\nprobably have communications channels\n\n263\n00:14:12.795 --> 00:14:14.825\nlike that or very, very secure.\n\n264\n00:14:14.825 --> 00:14:15.935\nSome of your high end.\n\n265\n00:14:15.935 --> 00:14:19.885\nI was trying to think research maybe,\n\n266\n00:14:19.885 --> 00:14:21.965\nI don't see a lot of\nthe whole red phone thing.\n\n267\n00:14:21.965 --> 00:14:23.080\nI think it would be cool.\n\n268\n00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.530\nI'd want it right net to my Bat phone and\nmy Bat signal.\n\n269\n00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.940\nBut if you had that capability,\nabsolutely take advantage of that.\n\n270\n00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.520\nAnd it might be something that you\nwanna implement in your networks.\n\n271\n00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.380\n&gt;&gt; And in general,\n\n272\n00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.420\njust securing the communications of\nstuff that's going on right now.\n\n273\n00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.990\nIt's something that you wanna do\nto make sure so that we don't just\n\n274\n00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.740\nrelease that information like you said,\npretty much to just anybody.\n\n275\n00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n276\n00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:52.566\nYou can, what if our VOIP system has been\ncompromised, and they have access to that?\n\n277\n00:14:52.566 --> 00:14:55.426\nAll of my messages, all of my voice\nconversations are getting converted into\n\n278\n00:14:55.426 --> 00:14:57.440\ndigital, going through this VOIP system.\n\n279\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.920\nIf somebody can intercept those packets,\n\n280\n00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.360\nif it's not protected, they could\npotentially get that information as well.\n\n281\n00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:09.340\nYou can do some communications through,\nI know I read one incident\n\n282\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.620\nresponse plan where they actually\nchanged their help desk message so\n\n283\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.110\nthat employees could get information.\n\n284\n00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.010\nThey call the help desk and the greeting,\nthe help desk wouldn't answer the phone\n\n285\n00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:23.630\nduring the incident, and\nthe greeting would say what's going on,\n\n286\n00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.780\nlimited information just to\nmake sure everybody's aware.\n\n287\n00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:32.020\nI've seen organizations print things out\nand have people standing in every doorway\n\n288\n00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.220\nand handing them to the employees as they\ncome in or go, that are saying, look,\n\n289\n00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.080\nthis is what's happened.\n\n290\n00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.540\nThis is what we need you to do,\nthis is what we don't want you to do, and\n\n291\n00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.480\nthings like that.\n\n292\n00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.430\nBut they'll print it out and\nhand it out that way.\n\n293\n00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:49.106\nJust again, out of bands communications,\nand as you were saying,\n\n294\n00:15:49.106 --> 00:15:51.599\nyou want that secure\nmethod of communication.\n\n295\n00:15:51.599 --> 00:15:55.585\nAnd then you've got your\nrole based responsibilities.\n\n296\n00:15:55.585 --> 00:15:58.791\nAnd really, when we talk about\nrole based responsibilities,\n\n297\n00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.815\nWe can kinda divide things up\ninto general categories, and\n\n298\n00:16:01.815 --> 00:16:04.976\nthis is something that you as\nan organization have to define.\n\n299\n00:16:04.976 --> 00:16:09.395\nI know a lot of our smaller shops like\nthe ones I typically work in are gonna be\n\n300\n00:16:09.395 --> 00:16:11.090\nmulti hat places all right.\n\n301\n00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:15.500\nYou're not just doing one job,\nyou do three or four jobs,\n\n302\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.120\nand so sometimes it can be\ngray between these rules but\n\n303\n00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.250\nyou've got your technical\nmanagement law enforcement.\n\n304\n00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.780\nYour technical people are gonna be the\nones that do your incident response that\n\n305\n00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.858\nactually deal with the evidence\nthat do the investigation.\n\n306\n00:16:30.858 --> 00:16:36.580\nThat core ledge log files, that CIF\nthrough the image of the drive looking for\n\n307\n00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.428\nillegal information or looking at\nlogs looking for abnomalities, and\n\n308\n00:16:40.428 --> 00:16:43.770\ndata ex-filtration is more\ndata leaving than normal, so\n\n309\n00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.410\nmaybe something is going on,\nsomebody is stealing data.\n\n310\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.100\nYour management,\nthey've got their role to play, right?\n\n311\n00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.210\nThey've got a deal with other\nstakeholders, maybe the board members.\n\n312\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.630\nThey've got a deal with\npartner organizations that\n\n313\n00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.360\nare hearing about this incident or\n\n314\n00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.110\nmaybe they need to notify them before\nthey hear about the incident, right?\n\n315\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.920\nSo management has their role to\nplay in incident response, and\n\n316\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.370\nthen law enforcement.\n\n317\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:10.450\nIf you plan on bringing\nlaw enforcement in so\n\n318\n00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.140\nthat you can prosecute in a court\nthen we need to get them involved and\n\n319\n00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:19.400\nthey're going to know their place they'll\ncome in and do what they've gotta do.\n\n320\n00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.580\nThink about again, it's all about\nplanning this ahead of time.\n\n321\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:26.210\nDeciding who has what role,\nwhat the responsibilities are,\n\n322\n00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.450\nand what we expect of them,\nhow to go about it,\n\n323\n00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:33.870\nhow to report the information\nback to the appropriate people.\n\n324\n00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.580\nNow the last thing I wanna talk about for\nthe communication process,\n\n325\n00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.370\nI had mentioned Incident Response,\nand you might use an external company\n\n326\n00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.910\nto do incident response if you\ndon't have your own internal train.\n\n327\n00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:49.390\nYou don't have the time, or the personnel,\nor the money to send them for training and\n\n328\n00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:53.150\nbuy the forensics workstation and\ninvest in that software.\n\n329\n00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:57.210\nBecause there are many, many open solution\ntools that you can use, there's also many,\n\n330\n00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.700\nmany very expensive ones\nthat you can purchase.\n\n331\n00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.710\nLike I'll give you a teaser of one that\nMike says, there's a trial for us.\n\n332\n00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:10.060\nI'll try to show you guys later, Encase,\nE-N-C-A-S-E is like the gold standard,\n\n333\n00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:14.190\nfor computer forensics,\nit's also very, very expensive.\n\n334\n00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.750\nBut there's open source tools\nthat do almost as good of a job\n\n335\n00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:25.340\nthat we can get for free, but\nif your organization doesn't have that.\n\n336\n00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.650\nDoesn't have the time, the resources\nto spend on a instant response team,\n\n337\n00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.020\ncuz if you think about it hopefully\nwe don't get incidents that\n\n338\n00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.970\noften if we're doing a good\njob protecting our network.\n\n339\n00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.830\nHopefully they're not like every day,\nor twice a day, or anything like that.\n\n340\n00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.360\nSo do I have staff that\nI can dedicate to this?\n\n341\n00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.870\nOr maybe I have a part-time staff, maybe\nI have some people that do other jobs,\n\n342\n00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.630\nbut they are part of the incident\nresponse team when necessary.\n\n343\n00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:53.750\nOr we have people that we have on\nretainer that are gonna do this,\n\n344\n00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.980\nor you hire an organization, and\nlet me show you a couple here, and\n\n345\n00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:01.550\nagain, no reflection on quality,\nor picking one over the other.\n\n346\n00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.770\nJust wanted to show you a couple so\nthat you could do your due diligence,\n\n347\n00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.390\nand if you need to hire\none of these people.\n\n348\n00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.260\nAnd just so we understand for\n\n349\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:12.130\nthe exam, that there are parties\nthat we can hire for this purpose.\n\n350\n00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.390\nSo let's take a look at my screen here,\n\n351\n00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:19.000\nI've got one from RSA They've got their\nCyber Incident Response Service, right?\n\n352\n00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.120\nWe'll see if there's any good information\ndown here, their benefits, they\n\n353\n00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:30.030\ntalk bout how their experience, they've\ngot the equipment, they've got knowledge.\n\n354\n00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.560\nThey do deploy a team for containment or\n\n355\n00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.740\nimmediation actions, limit the scope of\nthe attacks so they don't get as far,\n\n356\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.350\npreserve evidence, and\nI won't read all of these to you.\n\n357\n00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:47.290\nBut if you're curious, go out there and\nlook them up, that's RSA.\n\n358\n00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.360\nAnother one might be CrowdStrike,\nCrowdStrike I know,\n\n359\n00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.490\nand RSA was, I think they still are,\nhere in the states.\n\n360\n00:19:55.490 --> 00:20:00.600\nWe have the NSA and CrowdStrike I know is\non the list, I believe RSA is as well.\n\n361\n00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:06.920\nI think there's seven or eight actual\nNSA certified incident response teams.\n\n362\n00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.400\nThere's other organizations that could\nbe just as good, I'm not saying,\n\n363\n00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.750\nif they're not sponsored by the NSA,\nthat you shouldn't use them, all right?\n\n364\n00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:22.690\nBut there are some that have gone through\nthe criteria to become NSA certified.\n\n365\n00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.240\nSo they've gone through the procedures\nthat NSA requires for them to be on\n\n366\n00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.720\nthe list for governmental agencies to\nhire them as their incident response.\n\n367\n00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:36.630\nCrowd Strike is one of those, Incident\nResponse Services here from FireEye,\n\n368\n00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.130\nit's another one I'm pretty\nsure is on that list from NSA.\n\n369\n00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:43.060\nI didn't bother going into pricing or\nanything like that.\n\n370\n00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:47.740\nThat's something if your organization\nreally wants, they're gonna have to do and\n\n371\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.750\nfor the exam we don't need\nto know anything like that.\n\n372\n00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.410\nIt's not gonna be cheap but it's\n\n373\n00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.820\nstill gonna be cheaper than maintaining\na full time incident response staff.\n\n374\n00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:00.130\nRight, if you don't have resources for\nthat, this is\n\n375\n00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:05.460\njust another alternative again, there is\nothers that you can probably find locally.\n\n376\n00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.770\nAnd this is just in the states, I am sure\nthere is others all around the world but,\n\n377\n00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:14.800\njust understand that just because\nI don't have the resources or\n\n378\n00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.370\nthe trained personnel,\nI can still do incident response.\n\n379\n00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:23.850\nMaybe my incident response plan is to\nhire some organization like this and\n\n380\n00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:27.400\nhave them at the ready so that they can\ncome out and do this when I need it.\n\n381\n00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.700\nAnd they're gonna bring professionals\nthat know what they're doing and\n\n382\n00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.120\nhave the experience and\nthe equipment to do it.\n\n383\n00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.580\nSo maybe it's even a better way to\ngo than trying to train up staff,\n\n384\n00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:42.270\nand now the first incident comes along,\nyour entire staff,\n\n385\n00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.420\nthat's their first incident response\nthey've ever dealt with, right?\n\n386\n00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.800\nWhich is not a bad thing,\ndon't get me wrong,\n\n387\n00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.740\nyou gotta get your experience somewhere.\n\n388\n00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:53.730\nBut those are the kind of things\nyour organization has to contemplate\n\n389\n00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.830\nAs it's making these decisions.\n\n390\n00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:59.150\n&gt;&gt; And I can see where it would take\na lot of time, a lot of resources,\n\n391\n00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.180\na lot of effort and\na lot of money to do the training.\n\n392\n00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.760\nSo it's good that we do have\nservices like that to help us out.\n\n393\n00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.510\nNow Mike, it does look like we're\ncoming the end of another episode,\n\n394\n00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.140\nbut before we do, do you have any\nfinal words that maybe you'd like to\n\n395\n00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.290\nlet everybody know about\nthe communication process.\n\n396\n00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.790\n&gt;&gt; Like I said, the important thing is\njust to make sure you plan this out, and\n\n397\n00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:19.270\nyou run through a mock breach,\nor incident.\n\n398\n00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.630\nGive everybody a chance to\nkind of work through it,\n\n399\n00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:26.400\nsee how everything works,\nsee if there's anything we're missing.\n\n400\n00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.880\nDid we fail to notify anybody?\n\n401\n00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.630\nWe had this person on the list but\nthat's the wrong phone number for\n\n402\n00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.050\nthem things like that.\n\n403\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:36.000\nSo make sure you test this out and\ndon't just put it on the forget about it.\n\n404\n00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.610\nI have had an incident in six\nmonths maybe everything should\n\n405\n00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:43.370\nbe fine it's the kind of thing that you\nput on your quarterly things to do.\n\n406\n00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:48.080\nOne a quarter, we go through and we test\nand update our incident response plan,\n\n407\n00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.250\nvery, very important.\n\n408\n00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:51.780\n&gt;&gt; Mike, as always, thank you for\nbeing here in the studios with us.\n\n409\n00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.890\nAnd we do appreciate you\nthe viewer watching.\n\n410\n00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.150\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here at IT Pro TV.\n\n411\n00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:57.760\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n412\n00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.895\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n413\n00:22:58.895 --> 00:22:59.869\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n414\n00:22:59.869 -->

00:00:11.832\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:15.965\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome back to another\ngreat episode here in the ITProTV studios.\n\n5\n00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:17.095\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:18.315\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:21.929\nwe are coming back at you with more of\nthat CompTIA Cyber Security Analyst+.\n\n8\n00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.935\nAnd joining us in the studios again today,\nMr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:25.965\nMike, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:29.087\n&gt;&gt; Me, hey, I'm doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:29.087 --> 00:00:29.967\nThanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:33.481\nIt's Friday here at ITProTV land or\nat least the day we're recording this.\n\n13\n00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:36.247\nSo, we're all feeling a little punchy\nlooking forward to the weekend.\n\n14\n00:00:36.247 --> 00:00:37.227\nBut, we are back.\n\n15\n00:00:37.227 --> 00:00:42.637\nGlad to be here, doing our as Wes said\nmore of our Cybersecurity Analyst+ and\n\n16\n00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:47.880\nin today's episode we're gonna be\ntalking about, how we can look at or\n\n17\n00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.890\nread into symptoms that there\nmight have been an incident?\n\n18\n00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.310\nHow do we know if\nan incident has occurred?\n\n19\n00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.190\nIt's not like somebody puts a sign up or\nwe get a notification.\n\n20\n00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.020\nWell, I shouldn't say that.\n\n21\n00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.700\nCause actually, if you have your good\nintrusion detection prevention systems,\n\n22\n00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.620\nyou definitely can get notifications.\n\n23\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.960\nBut, just in general,\n\n24\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.380\nright when we start noticing odd behavior\nthat should raise an eyebrow, right?\n\n25\n00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.710\nMake us think, hey,\nthere's something going on and\n\n26\n00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.650\nmake us wanna delve into little deeper.\n\n27\n00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.830\nAnd actually, these are some\nkind of things that we can teach\n\n28\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.580\nour end users as well.\n\n29\n00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.520\nBecause they will be the first\nones to notice things like this.\n\n30\n00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.308\nThey can bring it to our attention and\n\n31\n00:01:27.308 --> 00:01:30.375\nthen we can determine whether\nit's an actual incident or not.\n\n32\n00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:34.159\nAnd whether we need to progress\nwith any type of investigation or\n\n33\n00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.430\nanything like that.\n\n34\n00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.540\nSo, just understanding what types of\nsymptoms we should be looking for or\n\n35\n00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.150\nshould peak our curiously into potentially\nbeing a security related incident.\n\n36\n00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.470\nSo they break it down, CompTIA into\na couple different categories here.\n\n37\n00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.600\nThey've got network related symptoms,\nhost related symptoms.\n\n38\n00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.110\nAnd then as I flip pages in my notes I\nthink it's, application related symptoms.\n\n39\n00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.019\nSo, let's talk about a few of these right,\n\n40\n00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:05.303\nand then I've got a few\nthings that I wanna show you.\n\n41\n00:02:05.303 --> 00:02:10.090\nAt least as far as the host based symptoms\ngo and things we might do as a next step.\n\n42\n00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.069\nRemember I said coming up next week we're\ngonna have lot of actual hands on demos.\n\n43\n00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.813\nGoing through lot of the tools\nthat they wants to call out, and\n\n44\n00:02:17.813 --> 00:02:22.009\nthey a look at their actual output and\nseeing what we can do with them.\n\n45\n00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.190\nAs we got some Google things coming up.\n\n46\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.653\nAll right, so let's start in Wes\nwith networking related symptoms and\n\n47\n00:02:27.653 --> 00:02:29.046\nI can probably just ask you.\n\n48\n00:02:29.046 --> 00:02:29.731\nHey Wes,\n\n49\n00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:35.920\nwhat kinda things would you think you\nmight see if your network is under attack?\n\n50\n00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.399\n&gt;&gt; One of the first things of is lack of\na specific service, one of the things I\n\n51\n00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:44.752\nalso think, is like a rogue service\non my network, like DHCP, maybe.\n\n52\n00:02:44.752 --> 00:02:49.590\nI know that we had this quite a few years\nnow that I think time's passing quick.\n\n53\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.875\n[LAUGH] We had this one of\nthe places that I worked too.\n\n54\n00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:53.972\nSomebody just happened to\nplug in an access point,\n\n55\n00:02:53.972 --> 00:02:55.639\nbrought the whole entire network down.\n\n56\n00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.958\nCuz it started flooding the network\nwith DHCP offers and well,\n\n57\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.035\nbasically a denial of service attack.\n\n58\n00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:03.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\nit's a really easy one to do.\n\n59\n00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.790\nIt’s an easy one for an end user\nto end of doing unintentionally.\n\n60\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.982\nAs you said, I know same place we were\nworking together we had somebody fire up\n\n61\n00:03:11.982 --> 00:03:14.174\nan instance of, I think it was VMWare and\n\n62\n00:03:14.174 --> 00:03:18.127\nit provided IP addresses to the virtual\nmachines at a DHCP engine and it.\n\n63\n00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:20.504\nBut, there was a check mark\nwhere you can say hey,\n\n64\n00:03:20.504 --> 00:03:24.239\nlisten on the physical network adapter and\nthey turned that on maybe knowing,\n\n65\n00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.576\nmaybe not knowing what\nthe heck they were doing.\n\n66\n00:03:26.576 --> 00:03:31.457\nAnd also running it as a service, so\neven though the VMware App was closed,\n\n67\n00:03:31.457 --> 00:03:36.419\nit was still listening on the physical\nnetwork adapter for DHCP requests and\n\n68\n00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.960\nthe ware switching closet was\nwe had 24 clients in this room.\n\n69\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.340\nAnd if they were to,\nif a DHCP request went out,\n\n70\n00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.430\nthis rogue DHCP server would hear, well\nbefore it got routed over to the network\n\n71\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.480\nthat the actual DHCP server lived on.\n\n72\n00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.210\nAnd so, we were getting as usual machines\nwere just dropping off the network.\n\n73\n00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.690\nYou go to look and see what's wrong.\n\n74\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.580\nThey've got this strange IP address\nthat shouldn't be on our network.\n\n75\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.170\nAnd it's obviously not working because\nwe don't have a default gateway in that\n\n76\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.590\nrange, DNS servers, etcetera, etcetera.\n\n77\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.830\nAnd so, it's just an unintentional,\n\n78\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.590\nwe think it was unintentional,\nreally tricky to trace down.\n\n79\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.050\nBut rogue services in general\ncan definitely be a very bad\n\n80\n00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.180\nthing on your network,\n\n81\n00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.300\neven if it's a simple thing like GHDP\nbecause it can cause denial of service.\n\n82\n00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.100\nYou get machines with\nduplicate IP addresses or\n\n83\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.750\nIP addresses on the wrong range.\n\n84\n00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.637\nRogue DNS servers are extremely\ndangerous because they can\n\n85\n00:04:29.637 --> 00:04:34.922\nstart redirecting clients to\neither places that don't exist.\n\n86\n00:04:34.922 --> 00:04:39.630\nEssentially doing them as not of\nservice or to malicious sites, right?\n\n87\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.197\nAnd trying to deliver malicious payloads.\n\n88\n00:04:42.197 --> 00:04:45.206\n&gt;&gt; And one of the interesting\nthings I think about that, Mike,\n\n89\n00:04:45.206 --> 00:04:48.982\nin that situation where it just brought\nthat whole entire room to its knees is\n\n90\n00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:50.528\njust how quickly it happened.\n\n91\n00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:53.894\nAnd then, also in the same point how it\nwas completely unattentional, I mean,\n\n92\n00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:56.760\nstudents have to learn somehow and\nyou kinda find out that.\n\n93\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.650\nNot only can this happen very quickly, but\n\n94\n00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.330\nit can also just be completely\nunintentional that the person\n\n95\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.760\ndidn't mean to do it to begin with\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n96\n00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.000\nit's a very common thing to see happen.\n\n97\n00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.790\nYou talk about an access point and\n\n98\n00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.690\nwe told our users we're not\ngonna set up wireless access.\n\n99\n00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.090\nSomebody really wants one,\n\n100\n00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.657\nthey're in one of those offices with\nthe glass on the side In the corner.\n\n101\n00:05:16.657 --> 00:05:19.010\nAnd so they're like,\nI'm bringing one in anyway.\n\n102\n00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.590\nAnd I'm plugging it in under my desk.\n\n103\n00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.850\nAnd now, they can sit in\ntheir big leather chair, and\n\n104\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.340\nspin around without any wires tangling up.\n\n105\n00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.970\nGreat for them but\n\n106\n00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.460\nwhat they don't realize is they just\nopened up a gaping hole in our security.\n\n107\n00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.570\nAnd they don't understand\nwhat they've done.\n\n108\n00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.810\nWhat's the harm in me hooking\nup this wireless access point?\n\n109\n00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.702\nWell, it's probably running DHCP, it's\nprobably running NET, it's not gonna be\n\n110\n00:05:39.702 --> 00:05:43.231\nsecured, we're not monitoring it,\nwe don't have policies in place on it.\n\n111\n00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:45.820\nI could keep going in\nthe number of bad things that\n\n112\n00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.862\ncould come from plugging in\nthat wireless access point.\n\n113\n00:05:48.862 --> 00:05:52.040\nBut end users don't and\nprobably shouldn't realize.\n\n114\n00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.420\nThe depth of what could happen, but\nwe can definitely educate them, right?\n\n115\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.060\nSo yeah, rogue devices on the network.\n\n116\n00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.750\nWhat do you do?\n\n117\n00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.090\nYou have to scan your network\nperiodically using different tools.\n\n118\n00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.980\nWe'll look at some of those\ntools later on during the week.\n\n119\n00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.410\nBut using different tools\nto scan your network and\n\n120\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.650\nsee what devices are out there.\n\n121\n00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.310\nYou should know.\n\n122\n00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.090\nYou should have a baseline of all\nthe devices that are on your network.\n\n123\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.920\nAnd every time you do\nthat scan you go back and\n\n124\n00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.100\nlook and, wait, there's an extra\nnode here that wasn't here before.\n\n125\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.530\nThere's an extra access point, or\n\n126\n00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.300\nanother service, somebody running\nDHCP that shouldn't be there.\n\n127\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.398\nMonitoring traffic with\nthings like Wireshark.\n\n128\n00:06:25.398 --> 00:06:29.170\nOr other packet-capture utilities,\nlooking for protocols\n\n129\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.560\nthat shouldn't be coming from that side of\nthe switch, or that side of the router.\n\n130\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.460\nSo, definitely things to look for.\n\n131\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.402\nOther things you're going to see,\nnetwork-related symptoms,\n\n132\n00:06:38.402 --> 00:06:40.353\nis just bandwidth consumption in general.\n\n133\n00:06:40.353 --> 00:06:43.220\nWell, the network is running really,\nreally slow.\n\n134\n00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.160\nIt is taking forever to pull\nthese relatively small file out.\n\n135\n00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.780\nAnd as because you got some malware that's\nexfiltrating data as fast as it can.\n\n136\n00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.680\nAnd it's sucking up.\n\n137\n00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.970\nWe've got a worm that's replicating so\nfast.\n\n138\n00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.820\nThat it eats up your bandwidth and\n\n139\n00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.080\nnobody can do what they're\nsupposed to do on the network.\n\n140\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.240\nSo, bandwidth consumption, if you\nsee your bandwidth drop drastically,\n\n141\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.860\ngood thing, you might wanna go check\nthings out, see what's causing that.\n\n142\n00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.770\nCould be legitimate.\n\n143\n00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.280\nCould be somebody just moving\na bunch of huge VMs around and\n\n144\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.900\nit's a temporary thing.\n\n145\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.400\nOr a switch or\none of the ports is failing.\n\n146\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.460\nAnd so, It could be legitimate but\nit's something that should,\n\n147\n00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.280\nagain raise that eyebrow and\nmake me take a look at what's going on.\n\n148\n00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.764\nBeaconing and this is one of those\nthings with wireless access points and\n\n149\n00:07:30.764 --> 00:07:34.824\nWes you and I have had the discussion\nseveral times on beaconing.\n\n150\n00:07:34.824 --> 00:07:38.774\nAnd it's a best practice to, depending\non who you read, who you talk to,\n\n151\n00:07:38.774 --> 00:07:43.240\nit's a good practice to turn off\nbeaconing on your wireless access points.\n\n152\n00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.230\nOther people we tell you,\n\n153\n00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.390\nyou shouldn't turn off beaconing\non your wireless access points.\n\n154\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.480\nAnd we could have that debate\nhere now all day long too, right?\n\n155\n00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.567\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's start it right now.\n\n156\n00:07:51.567 --> 00:07:53.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See I'm of the point now, just kidding.\n\n157\n00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.407\nI'm of the mindset that if\nyou turn off beaconing,\n\n158\n00:07:56.407 --> 00:07:59.792\nit really only keeps the legitimate\npeople out of your network.\n\n159\n00:07:59.792 --> 00:08:04.013\nBut it can also, and this is again,\nit's an opinion, I believe that it can\n\n160\n00:08:04.013 --> 00:08:08.837\nincrease the communications and have to go\nBetween things like your network cards and\n\n161\n00:08:08.837 --> 00:08:11.400\nyour laptops and the access points.\n\n162\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.380\nSo I'm of the mindset that it really\njust keeps the legitimate people out of\n\n163\n00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.010\nyour network.\n\n164\n00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.430\n&gt;&gt; In the end, that's really what\nit does because the problem,\n\n165\n00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.790\nif we wanna go through all the thing,\nthe problem is the beaconing, yes,\n\n166\n00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.650\nit's a little bit of bandwidth and yes,\nit advertises your access points location\n\n167\n00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.310\nto everybody including a bad guy or\nsomebody that shouldn't be there.\n\n168\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.160\nBut turning it off doesn't\nkeep them from finding it.\n\n169\n00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.080\nBecause it's still in any wireless\ntraffic that's going across your network.\n\n170\n00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.465\nThe name of the access point, this SSID is\nin the header of the packet, unencrypted,\n\n171\n00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:45.195\nso the bad guy can get it anyway with\nany kind of wireless packet sniffer.\n\n172\n00:08:45.195 --> 00:08:48.272\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I've seen one where,\nI've got WiFi Explorer.\n\n173\n00:08:48.272 --> 00:08:51.745\nIt's a cool little program on the Mac,\nand I love it when it says,\n\n174\n00:08:51.745 --> 00:08:54.800\n17 access points found and 5 hidden ones.\n\n175\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.690\nWait.\n\n176\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.700\nIf they're hidden how did\nmy application find it?\n\n177\n00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.040\nBut anyways I do digress on that one.\n\n178\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.650\nHere's another one I think, Mike.\n\n179\n00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.310\nYou have obviously peak\ntimes when you know\n\n180\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.350\nthat you're expecting a certain amount of,\nyou say bandwidth, right?\n\n181\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.970\nLike throughput.\n\n182\n00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.130\nYou should expect\na certain level of service.\n\n183\n00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.850\nMaybe a web application\nthat you have running and\n\n184\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.950\nyou know that there are going to be people\nhitting that server from 8 to 10 o'clock.\n\n185\n00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.140\nWell, how about in the afternoon when\nyou're expecting that that application\n\n186\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.530\nshouldn't be very busy and\nthen all of a sudden,\n\n187\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.810\nyou start to see that it's a little\nbit more busy on these off hours.\n\n188\n00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n189\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.040\nThat's a big indicator.\n\n190\n00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.830\n11 o'clock at night and\nnobody's on the network and\n\n191\n00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.870\nall of a sudden you see this\nhuge spike in outbound traffic.\n\n192\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.580\nSomething is going on right?\n\n193\n00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.790\nIf we don't have backups,\noff site backups scheduled to occur then,\n\n194\n00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.960\nwe need to take a look and\nsee what that is.\n\n195\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.110\nAnd one more thing about the beaconing,\njust to round out that conversation is,\n\n196\n00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.430\nyou were saying it could\nend up being less secure.\n\n197\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.330\nAnd one of the things with Microsoft,\nand with beaconing,\n\n198\n00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.250\nyour computer knows it's in range of an\naccess point by hearing those beacons and\n\n199\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.950\ngoing hey, look, this access point's\nin range, let me put it in the list.\n\n200\n00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.060\nAnd if you've connected to it before\nit might even connect automatically.\n\n201\n00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.470\nBut what if you're not in range or\nbeaconing has been turned off,\n\n202\n00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.690\nhow does your computer know that you're\nin the area of that access point?\n\n203\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.220\nIt actually ends up sending out\nrequests periodically looking.\n\n204\n00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.560\nSo if I'm at Starbucks,\n\n205\n00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.680\nmy machine now knows hey I need\nto see if I'm back at work yet.\n\n206\n00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.190\nAnd it can be sending out information\nabout the access point it's looking for\n\n207\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.120\nwhich now means the people there know\nthe name of my wireless access point so,\n\n208\n00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:26.980\nagain.\n\n209\n00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.920\n&gt;&gt; That is a good point,\n\n210\n00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.130\nI wouldn't even think about that because\nonce you go to the association steps,\n\n211\n00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.530\nthat information's cached somewhere\nwithin your computer, very good point.\n\n212\n00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.060\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n213\n00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.210\n&gt;&gt; One thing I think of Mike,\n\n214\n00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.830\nwhat happens if maybe you see\nan intrusion prevention system that\n\n215\n00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.270\nflags because all of a sudden you've got\nsomething going on in your network that,\n\n216\n00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.570\nunless you're an administrator,\nit just shouldn't be happening.\n\n217\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.170\n&gt;&gt; And that's just a good reason to\ndo further investigation, right?\n\n218\n00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.630\nAnd that's really what all these are.\n\n219\n00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.370\nThese are symptoms, but we don't know\nwhat the cause is at this point.\n\n220\n00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.000\nSo, it's not that we sound off\nalarms as soon as we see these, but\n\n221\n00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.510\nit does the first step in saying, hey is\nsomething suspicious going on here, what\n\n222\n00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.960\ncan we do, let's take a look at it, let's\nfigure out exactly what is causing this.\n\n223\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.310\nSo in other words irregular peer\nto peer type communications.\n\n224\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:18.750\nAlthough those can be really hard to\ndetect if users are sharing files or\n\n225\n00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.490\nif they're allowed to,\nI don't know maybe they've set up\n\n226\n00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.110\na peer to peer wireless connection,\nthose kind of things.\n\n227\n00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.520\n&gt;&gt; I've seen it before when people have\nbeen downloading Torrents on a network cuz\n\n228\n00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.430\nthey don't want to get caught for\n\n229\n00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.350\nthe obvious reason some\npeople download Torrents.\n\n230\n00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.090\nAnd you gotta understand,\nthe protocol's in the background.\n\n231\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:35.560\nThose are peer-to-peer applications.\n\n232\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.060\nAnd it connects to another machine.\n\n233\n00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.630\nAnd instead of connecting\nto another machine for\n\n234\n00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.410\nthe purposes of grabbing a piece of a file\nlike the protocol's supposed to do,\n\n235\n00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:45.240\nit connected to the other machine for the\npurposes of dropping a little package off.\n\n236\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.770\nThat then connected to another machine\ndropped a little package off and\n\n237\n00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.820\nthen we know where it goes from here.\n\n238\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.640\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so you know most\norganizations don't allow those\n\n239\n00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.360\npeer to peer type file sharing protocols\nshouldn't be on your network unless you've\n\n240\n00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.400\ngot a good reason, if you're setting\none up for work for some reason.\n\n241\n00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.260\nBut yeah shouldn't be there, and I've been\nin the same boat we've got the nastygram\n\n242\n00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.160\nfrom the ISP and we're like wait\nwho's downloading these movies?\n\n243\n00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.570\nAnd you gotta now go hunt and find out and\nfigure out where those were coming from.\n\n244\n00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.390\nNetwork related symptoms,\nI think we got that.\n\n245\n00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:21.675\nWhen it comes to host related symptoms,\nthe big ones, the obvious ones, right?\n\n246\n00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:23.805\nProcessor consumption, memory consumption.\n\n247\n00:12:23.805 --> 00:12:28.375\nYou go and you check your task manager or\nwhatever else you wanna use on your system\n\n248\n00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:32.395\nand your processor's sitting at 99% and\nyou have nothing running, right.\n\n249\n00:12:32.395 --> 00:12:36.071\nSomething could be wrong or it could be\ndoing a Windows update, one or the other.\n\n250\n00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:39.595\n[LAUGH] But memory consumption,\nsame kind of thing.\n\n251\n00:12:39.595 --> 00:12:43.125\nIf you see all of a sudden\nyour memory is used.\n\n252\n00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:45.970\nI mean,\nyou've got very little free memory left,\n\n253\n00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.030\nand you're not doing a lot of\nmultitasking, what's going on?\n\n254\n00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:54.520\nDo I have an application that maybe has a\nmemory leak, and is just eating up memory?\n\n255\n00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.810\nOr do I have somebody that's just\ngot malware on this system, and\n\n256\n00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.090\nit's using up memory?\n\n257\n00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.050\nOr it's, they're doing some\nStorage of some movies and\n\n258\n00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.130\nsending those out across your network.\n\n259\n00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:11.460\nSo memory consumption process, are\nconsumption drive capacity consumption.\n\n260\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.070\nWes, we've talked about\nthis one before where\n\n261\n00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.620\nwas a local law enforcement\nagency that is set up a server.\n\n262\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.990\nThey had just got it in on a Friday.\n\n263\n00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.350\nAnd you know how IT guys and gals are.\n\n264\n00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.390\nWe've got to play with our new toys so\nbreak it out of the box,\n\n265\n00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.320\nput it in the rack, plug it into the\nnetwork and boot it up and go, ooh look,\n\n266\n00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.570\nthere's our shiny completely new server,\nblinky lights, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n267\n00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.360\nGo home for the weekend.\n\n268\n00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.910\nCome back on Monday that\nbrand new server's drives,\n\n269\n00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.410\nfull, boom, done, all right?\n\n270\n00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.000\nIt's like, wait, what happened?\n\n271\n00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.450\nAnd, come to find out,\nsomebody had found it over the weekend,\n\n272\n00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.720\nbecause it was completely\ndefault installation.\n\n273\n00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.400\nBut I forget.\n\n274\n00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.540\nI think it was 2003's server at the time.\n\n275\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.800\nCompletely default installation\nhad been compromised and\n\n276\n00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.500\nwas now a ware store, you know?\n\n277\n00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.640\nAnd they were sending out who knows what.\n\n278\n00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.800\nAnd the ironic part is, because this\nwas the Law Enforcement Agency's server\n\n279\n00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.800\nthat they were using for\nthis illegal activity.\n\n280\n00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.710\n&gt;&gt; So no change management,\nno hardening or patchening of the server.\n\n281\n00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:09.665\nWe just got to see those\n\n282\n00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:10.520\nblinkety-blinkies-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n283\n00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.820\n&gt;&gt; On the front of the server go up.\n\n284\n00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.160\nI've actually had this where one I was\nhelping a person in another company and\n\n285\n00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.000\nsame thing.\n\n286\n00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.418\nHer files are like, we would clear files.\n\n287\n00:14:19.418 --> 00:14:22.680\nWe'd do the normal Windows cleaning,\nwhere temp files are cleaned and all that.\n\n288\n00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.830\nAnd literally by the next day,\na 250 gig, tells you how long it's been,\n\n289\n00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.215\n250 gig drive was completely\nfull in one night.\n\n290\n00:14:29.215 --> 00:14:30.790\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; And I tracked it down to her\n\n291\n00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.760\ntemporary files in her profile to know\nthat what had happened was, she connected.\n\n292\n00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.830\nThis is probably not the right\nconversation to have with somebody who\n\n293\n00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.260\njust got back from an RSA conference.\n\n294\n00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.360\nShe connected to a website\nto get a job applicant's or\n\n295\n00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.200\na potential job employees' resume.\n\n296\n00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.390\nAnd when the PDF, she downloaded it,\nit loaded something into her profile\n\n297\n00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.340\nthat started calling somewhere and\nit was filling up the drive.\n\n298\n00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.600\n&gt;&gt; Scary stuff.\n\n299\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:00.370\nWhat else can we talk about with host\nrelated symptoms, unauthorized software.\n\n300\n00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.320\nWe should scan our systems\nperiodically to see what's running.\n\n301\n00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.490\nWe know there's some software out there\nthat's bad, and we can go out and\n\n302\n00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:09.460\nget list of this.\n\n303\n00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.030\nWe can do our own research,\nor maybe through experience.\n\n304\n00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.730\nOr maybe we just don't want people\nrunning iTunes on our work computers, or\n\n305\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.750\nWorld or Warcraft and I'll date myself,\n\n306\n00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.620\nI don't even know if that\ngame's still out there anymore.\n\n307\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.150\nYou know,\nthings like that running on their systems.\n\n308\n00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.910\nBut people will still install this.\n\n309\n00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.910\nSo and we're not gonna get into programs\nthat can block the installation windows\n\n310\n00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.960\nand limit We can block that but the point\nis we need to check for that kind of stuff\n\n311\n00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.410\ncause it could be malware, that\nunintentional or unauthorized software,\n\n312\n00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:41.290\nmalicious processes, we need to\nsee what's running on the system.\n\n313\n00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:42.810\nWe get some strange ones.\n\n314\n00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.120\nOdd names, names you haven't seen.\n\n315\n00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.840\nIt's easy enough to go out and\ntake a look on the internet and see,\n\n316\n00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.890\nlook the process up and see what it is.\n\n317\n00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.650\nYou know there are several sites\nout there that will tell you,\n\n318\n00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:56.560\nhey this is known malware.\n\n319\n00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.630\nOr this is a part of this program.\n\n320\n00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.546\nIt sucks up resources, but\nit's not bad, or that kind of thing.\n\n321\n00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:07.686\nSo go out there and look and\nsee what those processes are.\n\n322\n00:16:07.686 --> 00:16:09.568\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nAnd this can be tricky, right.\n\n323\n00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:11.551\nBecause a process could\nhave a legitimate name.\n\n324\n00:16:11.551 --> 00:16:15.285\nIt just the fact that it's running\nfrom a context in another location,\n\n325\n00:16:15.285 --> 00:16:17.660\nthat the file,\nitself is a legitimate file.\n\n326\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.370\nSo when it shows up in Task Manager or\nsomething like that if you're using that,\n\n327\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.560\nthat you have to actually look at\nthe path and where it's executing from.\n\n328\n00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.870\nSo they get really,\nreally tricky on this one.\n\n329\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.470\nSo what else do we have like\nthat we've got to worry about?\n\n330\n00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:30.630\n&gt;&gt; Let's see and you're right.\n\n331\n00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:33.700\nHow many SVC hosts do you\nhave in your task list?\n\n332\n00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.750\nDo I know what those are and\n\n333\n00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.620\nif a bad guy renames his malware to\nSVC host it's gonna blend right in.\n\n334\n00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.770\nWhat else?\n\n335\n00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.580\nUnauthorized changes.\n\n336\n00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.700\nIf all of sudden a user's\ntelling you that, hey,\n\n337\n00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.500\nthere's files on my system\nthat have been modified and\n\n338\n00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.480\nI didn't do it might be a good reason\nto look a little closer at that system.\n\n339\n00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.690\nUnauthorized privileges.\n\n340\n00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.930\nWe start seeing accounts that\nshouldn't be there or accounts\n\n341\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.269\nthat have more privileges than should\nhave been assigned or that were assigned.\n\n342\n00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:03.250\nWe wanna take a look.\n\n343\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.010\nNow this is what the bad guy does,\n\n344\n00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.550\nthey're gonna be trying to escalate\ncredentials, break any account.\n\n345\n00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.600\nI don't care who's account I can steal,\nsomebody's got a weak password,\n\n346\n00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.810\nI'll get that account.\n\n347\n00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.615\nAnd now I have to do somehow get that\naccount more privileges than it was\n\n348\n00:17:15.615 --> 00:17:17.570\nassigned and I can go to town.\n\n349\n00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:23.450\nSo looking for an authorized privileges,\nchanges in privileges, Data exfiltration,\n\n350\n00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:28.790\nagain, monitoring traffic, looking at\nhow much data is moving off that system.\n\n351\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.900\nAnd really is about having baselines here.\n\n352\n00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.960\nIf you don't know what's normal, right?\n\n353\n00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.440\nWes uploads files all the time to Dropbox.\n\n354\n00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.540\nBut if I don't know that,\nI scanned the network and\n\n355\n00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.190\nI see him uploading all these files and\nnobody else is, I might think, hey\n\n356\n00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.190\nthat's unusual activity, when in fact it's\nnot because Wes does this every afternoon.\n\n357\n00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.610\nHe uploads his show notes and\n\n358\n00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:53.160\nthere's that spike in activity at\nthe same time of day or what have you.\n\n359\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.840\nSo having a good baseline,\nunderstanding what's normally there\n\n360\n00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.070\nmakes all these symptoms stick out for\nbetter, right?\n\n361\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:05.610\nAlso it's like whoa, that's unusual I see\nthat spike every afternoon from Wes but\n\n362\n00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.910\nnow it's doubled from what it normally\nis or Wes isn't here today but\n\n363\n00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.790\nI still see this spike,\nwait what's going on?\n\n364\n00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.360\nThose are the kind of things that\nyou gotta be thinking about.\n\n365\n00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.345\n&gt;&gt; So I won't know what anomalies are if\nI don't first know what normality is.\n\n366\n00:18:18.345 --> 00:18:21.091\nSo we have to,\nif I'm not following you right,\n\n367\n00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:25.855\nbaselines lead to normality that leads to\nus identifying something that's anomalous.\n\n368\n00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:30.485\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely right, you know you can't,\nwhat's a good way of putting it?\n\n369\n00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:33.145\nI like the way you put it,\nwe'll just stick with that, that was good.\n\n370\n00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:35.375\nAll right let's see what\nelse we wanna talk about.\n\n371\n00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:38.445\nI'll tell you what let's go ahead and talk\nabout application related symptoms and\n\n372\n00:18:38.445 --> 00:18:41.860\nthen we'll We'll dive in\nhere to the computer and\n\n373\n00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.750\nwe'll take a look at a couple of\nthese commands I wanna show you.\n\n374\n00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.900\nApplication related systems.\n\n375\n00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.980\nAgain, it's the same kind of thing.\n\n376\n00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.870\nAnom-, Anomalous, if I can say that,\nanomalous activities.\n\n377\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:56.770\nPrograms crashing or even launching\nwithout you actually launching them.\n\n378\n00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.120\nIntroduction of new accounts,\n\n379\n00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.860\nalright this is not really\napplication related but new accounts\n\n380\n00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.700\nshowing up on a system very good sign that\nsomebody is doing something malicious.\n\n381\n00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.620\nUnexpected output or\nunexpected outbound communications.\n\n382\n00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.250\nAgain, if I don't know what's expected,\nI don't know what's unexpected, right?\n\n383\n00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.760\nSo, I got to have an understanding\nof what's normally going on.\n\n384\n00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.980\nService interruption.\n\n385\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.247\nIf a service is no longer available,\n\n386\n00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:29.935\nsomebody's doing a denial of service\non that service, DOS on that service.\n\n387\n00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:31.725\nSo we wanna figure out\nwhat happened there.\n\n388\n00:19:31.725 --> 00:19:35.495\nMemory overflows, very,\nvery common type of attack.\n\n389\n00:19:35.495 --> 00:19:36.085\nBuffer overflows,\n\n390\n00:19:36.085 --> 00:19:40.855\nwe won't get into the inner workings\nof them in this particular class.\n\n391\n00:19:40.855 --> 00:19:45.080\nBut it's one of the more common attacks\nthat we see out there because it's\n\n392\n00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.230\na weakness of the application and we get\nthese applications from different people\n\n393\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.270\nthat they may be and a lot of application\nvendors they're in a rush to get their\n\n394\n00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.928\nproduct out and they don't put it through\nthorough testing before it goes out.\n\n395\n00:19:57.928 --> 00:20:01.630\nThey figured, hey we buy it use it and\nwe'll be their testers.\n\n396\n00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:06.520\nSo many applications I have\nbuffer overflow vulnerabilities.\n\n397\n00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.800\nAll right, so with that said,\nlet's take a look at some commands.\n\n398\n00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.370\nI'm gonna start on Windows, and\n\n399\n00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:17.070\nsome of these command you're gonna know if\nyou've worked with computers very long,\n\n400\n00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.290\nothers maybe Surprise you like,\nI didn't know it could do that.\n\n401\n00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.440\nBut these are just some general commands\nthat I can use to kind of explore and\n\n402\n00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.310\ntry to figure out some of the things\nthat we were just talking about.\n\n403\n00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:32.450\nLike when it comes to processes in\nWindows, we have our Task Manager.\n\n404\n00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:36.960\nSo I like to launch Task Manager by\nright-clicking on my task bar and\n\n405\n00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.870\nchoosing Task Manager.\n\n406\n00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:47.090\nWe can always do task mgr.exe from\nthe command line, do the same thing.\n\n407\n00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:52.320\nNow Windows, I dunno when this started,\nVista, I think or something?\n\n408\n00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.460\nThey give you this kinda strange little\nwindow that doesn't tell you much,\n\n409\n00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.380\njust shows you a couple\nthings that are running.\n\n410\n00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:02.200\nYou click more details down here in\nthe bottom-left and we get back to the old\n\n411\n00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.877\nschool task manager, in fact it's a little\nbetter than the old school task manager.\n\n412\n00:21:05.877 --> 00:21:08.600\nBut you are looking at process here,\nall right?\n\n413\n00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.054\nThese are all the different processes that\nare running on my system, gives me my CPU,\n\n414\n00:21:13.054 --> 00:21:15.170\nmy memory, my disc, my network.\n\n415\n00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:19.260\nI can sort by any one of these columns,\neither ascending or descending.\n\n416\n00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.760\nSo I can figure out what is it that's\ntaking up all of my processor, or\n\n417\n00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.370\nwhat application is it that's\ntaking up all of my memory?\n\n418\n00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.480\nSo a great place to start here.\n\n419\n00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.640\nYou also have your performance tab which\nwill give you an indicator visually\n\n420\n00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.000\nThe performance on your system.\n\n421\n00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.260\n&gt;&gt; Mike, you had mentioned just\na few minutes ago that I can\n\n422\n00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.690\nfind a process online.\n\n423\n00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.020\nIs there a way that we can do\nthat here in the Task Manager?\n\n424\n00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:46.180\nIf I look at maybe that Process tab and\nthere's something going on,\n\n425\n00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:51.170\nis there a way that even from inside Task\nManager that I can maybe look and connect?\n\n426\n00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can right-click\non that guy and go to Details.\n\n427\n00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.870\nSo I just picked a random process here.\n\n428\n00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.050\nand it's going to take you over\nthe details screen which, it's funny for\n\n429\n00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.420\nthose of you that go back in time\nthis used to be what, applications?\n\n430\n00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.840\nAnd it would take you to the processes\ntab, and now it's processes.\n\n431\n00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.490\nApps became processes and\nprocesses became details.\n\n432\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.070\nBut there I can see it's\nmicrosoft.photos.exe.\n\n433\n00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.930\nThis is also one way I can end the task.\n\n434\n00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.410\nIf I find something that's I\ndon't think should be there.\n\n435\n00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.630\nThis is where I might\ntry to go to end that.\n\n436\n00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:27.780\nFrom the command line though,\nwe also have one called task list.\n\n437\n00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.400\nAnd task list is just a command that\nshows me a lot of the same information.\n\n438\n00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.380\nI can see, let me scroll back up here,\nthat the name of the application,\n\n439\n00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.630\nthe process ID The session name,\n\n440\n00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:43.710\nwho was actually running that session,\nhow much memory it's using.\n\n441\n00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.570\nLet me see if I have anything\nthat's unimportant here.\n\n442\n00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.610\nOffice Click-To-Run, who needs that?\n\n443\n00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.110\nBut that's a long name to type.\n\n444\n00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.080\nWhat else can I kill?\n\n445\n00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.610\n&gt;&gt; How about Spooler?\n\n446\n00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.200\n&gt;&gt; Spooler, there we go.\n\n447\n00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.810\nI can do taskkill.\n\n448\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:08.777\nSpool, If I could type Spooler and\nthat it's an executable.\n\n449\n00:23:08.777 --> 00:23:10.170\nAnd it didn't like that.\n\n450\n00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.163\nIs spooler actually running?\n\n451\n00:23:14.086 --> 00:23:16.130\nMaybe not, but anyway, it's not important.\n\n452\n00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:21.390\nI don't wanna kill any of these\nthat might crash my system here\n\n453\n00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:26.380\nonscreen, but task kill and if you need\nmore information about these commands,\n\n454\n00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.725\njust task kill switch question mark.\n\n455\n00:23:28.725 --> 00:23:32.831\n[SOUND] And you'll get the usage, right.\n\n456\n00:23:32.831 --> 00:23:33.830\nWhat switches I can do.\n\n457\n00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.880\nI can use the process ID with that.\n\n458\n00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.940\nInstead, I needed to do the image name\nin front of there, I forgot my switch.\n\n459\n00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.220\nMy process idea is typically a little\nbit easier cuz you know as we always get\n\n460\n00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.190\nthe P ID and most of that output there.\n\n461\n00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:52.785\nBut task kill, you can do taskkill/svc So\n\n462\n00:23:52.785 --> 00:23:55.080\na few different switches\nI can use with that.\n\n463\n00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.620\nRegistry keys that you\nalways want to check out.\n\n464\n00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.480\nLet's do a little reg edit.\n\n465\n00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.808\nREGEDIT, from my run dialog box.\n\n466\n00:24:03.808 --> 00:24:09.061\nOpens up reg edit and I'll zoom in\na little bit here so you can see this.\n\n467\n00:24:09.061 --> 00:24:12.019\nActually, I won't be able\nto zoom while I click.\n\n468\n00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:14.140\nBut let me collapse some of this up.\n\n469\n00:24:16.466 --> 00:24:19.020\nSo we can get back to the beginning.\n\n470\n00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.370\nSo there's your five hives, right,\nthat are located in our Windows registry.\n\n471\n00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:27.054\nBut what we really wanna take\na look at is local machine and\n\n472\n00:24:27.054 --> 00:24:30.384\nthen software, Microsoft, Windows.\n\n473\n00:24:33.895 --> 00:24:37.260\nAnd then we're gonna\ngo to current version.\n\n474\n00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.070\nAnd there's actually a few\nin here I wanna look at,\n\n475\n00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:44.620\nand we gotta zoom in, whoops, there we go.\n\n476\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:50.540\nNow you see where it says Run and\nRun Once,\n\n477\n00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.398\nthose two guys I can probably do a little\nbit better on that circling there.\n\n478\n00:24:53.398 --> 00:24:54.032\nRun.\n\n479\n00:24:54.032 --> 00:24:58.100\nRun Once, and\nif you have one called Run Once EX,\n\n480\n00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:03.290\nall three of these are locations of things\nthat will run automatically, right.\n\n481\n00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.690\nSo all my startup type programs\nare gonna be in here, and\n\n482\n00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.650\nthis is a great place for\nthe bad guys to put the malware.\n\n483\n00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.880\nSo that if you try to clean it out,\nyou reboot the system and\n\n484\n00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.790\nit loads up the registry.\n\n485\n00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.120\nIt reads this run.\n\n486\n00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.610\nAnd it reads the Run Once keys, and\nanything in there will execute, and\n\n487\n00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.020\nso that's how they keep that\nmalware persistent there.\n\n488\n00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.560\nSo, good idea to go check\nyour registry looking for\n\n489\n00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.130\nstrange or unknown or new entries.\n\n490\n00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.550\nI should know what should be here,\nor what is supposed to be here.\n\n491\n00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:36.820\nIf I see something that's not supposed\nto be there, I need to get rid of it, or\n\n492\n00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.309\nat least do some further investigation.\n\n493\n00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.200\nCommands for the network.\n\n494\n00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.500\nYou can do a net view.\n\n495\n00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.570\nAnd then say local host.\n\n496\n00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:50.170\nI don't think I have any\nconnections going on right now.\n\n497\n00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:55.220\nLet me fire up, let's just grab something\n\n498\n00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.560\nhere and do something like that.\n\n499\n00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.160\nI'll just grab one of those\nI'm just gonna minimize it.\n\n500\n00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:08.020\nI'll see if I can get, no, that's because\n\n501\n00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:12.520\nthat's that darn cache copy of that file.\n\n502\n00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.880\nBut if I had connections from\nthis machine to other machines,\n\n503\n00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.060\nthis is where I can go look.\n\n504\n00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.000\nThat net view command,\nwill give me that information.\n\n505\n00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.070\nNet session is another one, that I can do,\n\n506\n00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:29.498\nI get no command no entries in here,\nI should have connected that before.\n\n507\n00:26:29.498 --> 00:26:32.940\nBut net view and net sessions,\ngood ones to use to look for\n\n508\n00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.610\nstrange connections,\nespecially the connections\n\n509\n00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:39.630\noutside of your network that shouldn't be\nthere from one of your client machines.\n\n510\n00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.730\nThose are couple of\nthe commands that you can use,\n\n511\n00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:46.940\nyou also have the good old tried and\ntrue nbtstat,\n\n512\n00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.040\nwe can do like a -s, there are several\ndifferent switches I can use with that.\n\n513\n00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:56.180\nIts gonna look at my network adapters and\nshow me connections based on each adapter.\n\n514\n00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.250\nIn a multi-home device or in virtualized\nmachines, this is a good one to use so\n\n515\n00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.490\nI can see which adapter is\nactually making that connection.\n\n516\n00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.040\nBecause I can see like these\nare virtual adapters here.\n\n517\n00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.080\nAll right.\n\n518\n00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.430\nAnd it'll show me, a look he's got\na Bluetooth connection to Wes's.\n\n519\n00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.010\nWhy, what?\n\n520\n00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.940\nYeah, old Wes is over there trying\nto do some blue jacking on me.\n\n521\n00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.290\nBut a good one to use there netstat.\n\n522\n00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.600\nWhat else?\n\n523\n00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.050\nSome start up and scheduled tasks.\n\n524\n00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:29.990\nRight those run once if we want to look in\nthe registry there we can also see some of\n\n525\n00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:31.715\nthat from the command line.\n\n526\n00:27:31.715 --> 00:27:38.160\nMsconfig actually opens up a little dialog\nbox where I can see my start up items.\n\n527\n00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.530\nAnd now it takes you back to Task Manager,\nI always like that.\n\n528\n00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:46.100\nBut this is where I could disable those,\nprevent them from running automatically.\n\n529\n00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:50.180\nYou can see what services are running,\nwhat their current state is.\n\n530\n00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.160\nI like this option too,\nto hide Microsoft services.\n\n531\n00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.680\nNot to say that the bad guys couldn't\nrename some of this stuff or\n\n532\n00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.020\ntry to get it assigned as Microsoft.\n\n533\n00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.690\nBut it does eliminate some of them,\nmakes the list a little bit shorter, so\n\n534\n00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:05.230\nI can go through here and\nI can see, okay what's running oops,\n\n535\n00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:10.200\nwhat's running on my system, see if\nthere's anything that should not be there.\n\n536\n00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:16.625\nWhat are the good ones we got Wes,\nscheduled tasks is a good one, SCH tasks.\n\n537\n00:28:20.172 --> 00:28:23.085\nAll right and this is gonna show\nyou again, scheduled tasks,\n\n538\n00:28:23.085 --> 00:28:26.338\nlike here's Windows Defender,\nit's actually a scheduled task and\n\n539\n00:28:26.338 --> 00:28:28.090\nI can see when it's supposed to run.\n\n540\n00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:31.010\nNot applicable, did I kill Defender?\n\n541\n00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:32.890\nI might have.\n\n542\n00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:37.120\nUpdate Orchestrator,\nI can see when the last time it was run.\n\n543\n00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.422\nBut what I'm looking for\nis things that shouldn't be here, right?\n\n544\n00:28:40.422 --> 00:28:44.190\nDoing jobs, rescheduled tasks and\n\n545\n00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:48.780\nWindows is a great way to introduce scans.\n\n546\n00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.020\nWe've used,\nactually ended up using this with Daniel,\n\n547\n00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.910\nin a couple of different attacks\nwhere you could schedule something\n\n548\n00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.610\ncuz you could get it to run with\nadministrative credentials.\n\n549\n00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:02.550\nSo you wanna check and see what kinda\nscheduled tasks are on your machine,\n\n550\n00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.616\nis there anything that\nshould not be there?\n\n551\n00:29:04.616 --> 00:29:06.999\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n552\n00:29:06.999 --> 00:29:11.800\n&gt;&gt; And actually, Mike, seen one there\nwhere they did attack the task scheduler,\n\n553\n00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.270\nand they also downloaded a wake on LAN.\n\n554\n00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:18.970\nAnd it caused a service, it was at a\ncertain time send a wake on LAN packet or\n\n555\n00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:21.370\nit would wake up another machine and\n\n556\n00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:25.670\nbasically it started a cascading chain of\nevents that would go to other machines so\n\n557\n00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.210\nyeah you definitely have to\nworry about task sched or\n\n558\n00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.410\nscheduled task like you're talking about\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, what else we got.\n\n559\n00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:38.170\nIf you wanna see netuser shows\nyou the local accounts or\n\n560\n00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:42.300\nany account that has a profile on here\nI should say, so that is a good one.\n\n561\n00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.680\nAgain, the bad guys are going\nto want to build or\n\n562\n00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.740\ncreate accounts on your systems and\nget those credentials escalated.\n\n563\n00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:53.542\nNetuser, Netlocal group\nadministrators is another good one.\n\n564\n00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:00.527\nShows you who is in there,\n\n565\n00:30:00.527 --> 00:30:05.000\nyou should definitely know who is supposed\nto be in your local admins group.\n\n566\n00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.740\nAnd if somebody's there that shouldn't be,\nneed to try to get them out.\n\n567\n00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.630\nAnd if we use,\nwe've talked about another class.\n\n568\n00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.700\nI know we use restricted groups\nin our Windows environment\n\n569\n00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.560\nto try to control those\nlocal group memberships.\n\n570\n00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:22.540\nAnd then the last one for the Windows\npart is gonna be good old event manager.\n\n571\n00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:28.930\nA couple of different ways you\ncan get there, eventmgr.msc and\n\n572\n00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:35.660\nI lied to you there, vdwr why did I\ntype mgr event viewer not event manager.\n\n573\n00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:40.690\n.msc, local opens up your event viewer so\n\n574\n00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:43.520\nyou can launch it from your Windows menu,\njust as easily.\n\n575\n00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.790\nBut the thing about Windows log is,\nWindows does a good job about logging,\n\n576\n00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:50.300\nwe just have to remember to go\nin there and to look, all right.\n\n577\n00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.060\nTill you come in here,\nsee what's going on in your system,\n\n578\n00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.600\none of the first things you wanna do is\njust make sure your logs are working,\n\n579\n00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.800\nthat you actually have entries.\n\n580\n00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.540\nIf I come in and\nsee my security log is blank,\n\n581\n00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.760\nthat's a good indicator that\nsomething is going wrong.\n\n582\n00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.300\nThere should be at least one\nentry in there, saying that\n\n583\n00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.770\nMike Roderick cleared the security log at\nsuch-and-such time, on such-and-such date.\n\n584\n00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.720\nThen that's what the bad\nguys are going to do,\n\n585\n00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.690\nis they're going to cover their tracks,\nright?\n\n586\n00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:18.710\nThe last step in the hacking life\ncycle is, cover your tracks.\n\n587\n00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:23.020\nAnd that's what they're gonna try to do\nis they're gonna try to wipe your logs.\n\n588\n00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.740\nSo come in here, look at them.\n\n589\n00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:28.810\nOther than making sure they're there,\nI need to look for warnings and\n\n590\n00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.480\nwhen we look at event logs, see if I can\nfind some of the different types here.\n\n591\n00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:38.000\nLots of this little i is informational,\nsurely I got some warnings.\n\n592\n00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.060\nMy system is doing so good.\n\n593\n00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.100\nThere we go.\n\n594\n00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.290\nYeah, the little exclamation mark for\nwarnings.\n\n595\n00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.580\nThe red circle with\nthe exclamation mark for errors.\n\n596\n00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.170\nThose are the ones I wanna look at.\n\n597\n00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.420\nAnd trying to scroll through here and\nfind them is crazy.\n\n598\n00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.610\nSo make sure you that\nlearn how to filter logs,\n\n599\n00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.540\nwith whatever log system you're using.\n\n600\n00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:01.141\nI only want to see the criticals and\nthe errors and the warnings, for example.\n\n601\n00:32:01.141 --> 00:32:03.658\nAll right, and so now,\nI've got all the juicy stuff.\n\n602\n00:32:03.658 --> 00:32:06.927\nThe other stuff's still there,\nI can always clear my filter.\n\n603\n00:32:06.927 --> 00:32:10.934\nAnd get back to it but.\n\n604\n00:32:10.934 --> 00:32:13.173\nSo yeah, being able to filter those logs,\n\n605\n00:32:13.173 --> 00:32:15.861\nWindows has great great\nfiltering capabilities.\n\n606\n00:32:15.861 --> 00:32:17.678\nYou can create subscriptions, so\n\n607\n00:32:17.678 --> 00:32:22.000\nthat if I need to check the log files on\n15 different servers, if that's my job,\n\n608\n00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.198\nrather than remoting into all\nthose 15 servers everyday,\n\n609\n00:32:25.198 --> 00:32:29.164\nI subscribe to their log files and\nthey all get sent to my desktop everyday.\n\n610\n00:32:29.164 --> 00:32:32.190\nAnd so now when I come in in the morning,\nI just create my filter view.\n\n611\n00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.850\nAnd I can go through all those log\nfiles there in one quick shot.\n\n612\n00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:36.850\nAll right.\n\n613\n00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:38.060\nHow do we doing on time there Wes?\n\n614\n00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.270\nWe're just got our Linux commands left.\n\n615\n00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.250\n&gt;&gt; I think we'll be all right, yeah.\n\n616\n00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:45.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that some of the commands\nthat you used in your Windows systems when\n\n617\n00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.520\nyou see something as\npotentially suspicious.\n\n618\n00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.770\nYou want to take a further look or a\nlittle bit deeper investigation into that.\n\n619\n00:32:53.770 --> 00:33:00.570\nLet's flip over to Kali, or Ka-lee.\n\n620\n00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:04.021\nAnd we're going to log in\nwith my super secret password\n\n621\n00:33:06.034 --> 00:33:10.940\nAll right, and Linux has commands\nthat do very similar things, right?\n\n622\n00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.220\nSome of the commands are actually\nthe same but most of them are not.\n\n623\n00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.055\nBut like PS is a good one to do,\nhopefully you guys can see that up there.\n\n624\n00:33:18.055 --> 00:33:23.230\nPs-aux is gonna show me, its a lot like\nrunning task manager, its gonna show me,\n\n625\n00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:27.244\nI'll scroll back up to the top so\nwe can see our column headers.\n\n626\n00:33:27.244 --> 00:33:32.030\nAnd the user that's running that process,\nthe process ID, the CPU and\n\n627\n00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.270\nmemory utilization of that process.\n\n628\n00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:38.930\nAnd some more information start time\nthe command at launch that process.\n\n629\n00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.810\nSo again, coming through here and\nknowing what should be there looking for\n\n630\n00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.570\nanything unusual.\n\n631\n00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:49.188\nYou can do some other one like lsof-p and\n\n632\n00:33:49.188 --> 00:33:55.080\nthen maybe the process ID,\nlet's find one here, let's do 1951.\n\n633\n00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.139\nSo that's lsof-p and\n\n634\n00:33:58.139 --> 00:34:03.290\nthen the actual process ID that you\nwanna get more detailed information on,\n\n635\n00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:05.730\nand I must have killed that and\nthe process must have ended.\n\n636\n00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.770\nSo let's try another one.\n\n637\n00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:10.658\nThere's Bash 1569.\n\n638\n00:34:14.733 --> 00:34:19.658\nAll right and so\nwhat this is showing me is this process\n\n639\n00:34:19.658 --> 00:34:24.375\nthat I just, this process ID was for\nmy Bash shell.\n\n640\n00:34:24.375 --> 00:34:28.913\nThese are the different resources and\nfiles that my Bash shell or\n\n641\n00:34:28.913 --> 00:34:34.180\nthat particular process ID,\nwhatever I chose is accessing, right?\n\n642\n00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.680\nSo you can see what those\nprocesses are doing.\n\n643\n00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:42.763\nFinding files, i didn't mention\nthis in Windows but looking for\n\n644\n00:34:42.763 --> 00:34:45.958\nfiles of, abnormal files like large files.\n\n645\n00:34:45.958 --> 00:34:49.408\nHow am i wanna do,\nwriting Windows Explorer up there,\n\n646\n00:34:49.408 --> 00:34:53.233\nthe search dialog box that they,\nthe top right hand corner,\n\n647\n00:34:53.233 --> 00:34:57.360\nwe can do searches and\nwe can do like size filters, greater than.\n\n648\n00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.440\nWe want to try to do that looking for\nbig files.\n\n649\n00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.330\nUsually we're looking for\npeople that shouldn't have movies.\n\n650\n00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:07.600\nI mean, most of my end users don't\nhave files over say 10 megs in size\n\n651\n00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:12.000\nunless they're a database person or\nthey've got movies and games and\n\n652\n00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.150\nother things stored on their computer.\n\n653\n00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:18.330\nOr malware stored on their computer,\nso we can use those commands or\n\n654\n00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:21.780\nuse the Windows search\nfeature to find those.\n\n655\n00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:27.460\nIn Linux you can do a find, you can\ntype in find, switch, and let's say I\n\n656\n00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:32.300\nwant to find all the processes or all the\nfiles that have root permissions on them.\n\n657\n00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:37.310\nI can do a -uid 0, that's gonna be root,\nmy superuser in Linux,\n\n658\n00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:40.583\nit's like the local\nadministrator in Windows.\n\n659\n00:35:40.583 --> 00:35:44.779\n-perm, for permissions.\n\n660\n00:35:44.779 --> 00:35:49.469\n4000, or should I say -4000, and\nmy typing skills are lacking today.\n\n661\n00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:51.402\n-print.\n\n662\n00:35:53.358 --> 00:35:58.311\nAnd so these are the different things\nthat will run with root permissions,\n\n663\n00:35:58.311 --> 00:36:01.064\nas I'm looking for any strange scripts or\n\n664\n00:36:01.064 --> 00:36:04.380\nany strange files that\nrun with root privileges.\n\n665\n00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:08.960\nDefinitely want to find those and\nmake sure they are supposed to be there.\n\n666\n00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.910\nWhat else can we do on Linux?\n\n667\n00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.020\nWe can do file size searches with find.\n\n668\n00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:19.170\nIt's just a dash size and there's like\nplus 50,000 k or something like that.\n\n669\n00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.400\nNetwork wise, maybe I want to see,\n\n670\n00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.730\nlet's do an IP link and\nI'm gonna pipe that out into grep.\n\n671\n00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:33.570\nFor promiscuous, P-R-O-M-I-S-C, all right.\n\n672\n00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:35.040\nAnd I've got none which is good.\n\n673\n00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.700\nBut what this is doing is\nchecking my network adapters,\n\n674\n00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.310\nmy different links that I have.\n\n675\n00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:42.570\nAnd seeing if any of them are in\npromiscuous mode which they really\n\n676\n00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:46.030\nshouldn't be unless they've got reason\nto be doing network sniffing, right.\n\n677\n00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.614\nPromiscuous mode,\nif you don't know is when you,\n\n678\n00:36:48.614 --> 00:36:53.780\nour network adapter normally only responds\nto traffic destined for it, right.\n\n679\n00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.673\nIn the header of the packet as\nthat data goes by on the wire,\n\n680\n00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:58.277\nwe see the Mac address in there.\n\n681\n00:36:58.277 --> 00:37:00.076\nAnd if your network\nadapter sees a packet and\n\n682\n00:37:00.076 --> 00:37:02.224\nthe Mac address is not is\nit just ignores it, right.\n\n683\n00:37:03.609 --> 00:37:06.737\nIn promiscuous mode, you tell your\nnetwork adapter to grab all traffic,\n\n684\n00:37:06.737 --> 00:37:08.359\nwhether it's destined for it or not.\n\n685\n00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:10.940\nAnd this is how we sniff network traffic.\n\n686\n00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.940\nBut most of my end-user systems shouldn't\nhave network adapters in promiscuous mode.\n\n687\n00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.600\nSo this is a way that I can check.\n\n688\n00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:19.860\nWhat else?\nWe've seen Netstats,\n\n689\n00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.580\nreally no different in Linux.\n\n690\n00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.405\nArp is also in both Linux and Windows.\n\n691\n00:37:24.405 --> 00:37:27.255\nWe didn't do our, let's do an arp-a.\n\n692\n00:37:27.255 --> 00:37:30.085\nAll right,\narp is my address resolution protocol.\n\n693\n00:37:30.085 --> 00:37:33.445\nThis is what maps IP\naddresses to Mac addresses.\n\n694\n00:37:33.445 --> 00:37:35.665\nAnd this is where you would look for\n\n695\n00:37:35.665 --> 00:37:37.570\nsystems that maybe shouldn't\nbe on your network.\n\n696\n00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:41.270\nFind those rogue devices that\nare spitting out ARP registrations.\n\n697\n00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.080\nAnd your machine is caching those.\n\n698\n00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:47.310\nThis is how, one way, that I can\nfind rogue devices on my system.\n\n699\n00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.180\nSchedule tasks, crontab is a good one.\n\n700\n00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:58.570\nChecking for, we can look for scheduled\ntasks that run with root permissions.\n\n701\n00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:04.020\nSo they say crontab, C-R-O-N-T-A-B -u and\n\n702\n00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:09.341\nthen root for the user and\n-l and I got no scheduled\n\n703\n00:38:09.341 --> 00:38:14.620\ntask running under root\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n704\n00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.480\nI shouldn't have any,\nI know I don't have any, so\n\n705\n00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.850\nif something showed up there\nthat's when I would be suspicious.\n\n706\n00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:27.050\nWhat else, looking for accounts,\nif I wanna find root permission accounts.\n\n707\n00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:30.010\nAgain, a very important one to do,\nbecause I need to know if\n\n708\n00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:34.100\nsomebody's creating an accounts and\nthen, getting them root level access.\n\n709\n00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.400\nWe can do something like egrep and then,\n\n710\n00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.880\nit's going to be ':0:'.\n\n711\n00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:47.420\nAnd we're going to look in etc/paswrd,\nfor their password file.\n\n712\n00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.160\nI'm sorry, no r in there.\n\n713\n00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.630\nI always do that.\n\n714\n00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:54.240\netc/paswrd, and hit Enter.\n\n715\n00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:59.070\nAnd I only see one account that has those\nroot permissions, so I'm good to go.\n\n716\n00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:02.290\nSo an easy, quick command that\nI can do to check and se,\n\n717\n00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:06.410\nif I think something's been done on this\nmachine that had administrative access.\n\n718\n00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:10.730\nI can see what accounts in here\nhave that root level access.\n\n719\n00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:16.250\nLog files in Linux,\nwe could do a more-f switch var.\n\n720\n00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.650\nMost of our log files are in var log.\n\n721\n00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:25.770\nSo let's do a switch\nvar/log switch messages,\n\n722\n00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:30.080\nin here I can get in into my log file and\nstarts analyzing.\n\n723\n00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.330\nThat's right.\n\n724\n00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:35.220\nIt's not the most exciting time in\nthe world, we start analyzing log files.\n\n725\n00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.525\nBut it's gonna be done, somebody has\nto go through here and look at this.\n\n726\n00:39:38.525 --> 00:39:42.780\nThere's software I can get that can\nhelp me crunch this log file and\n\n727\n00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:47.230\nlook for important information but\nsomebody has to go through.\n\n728\n00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:51.510\nSome other commands, last ones I\nwant to mention here Wes, uptime is.\n\n729\n00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:52.530\nLet me get out of here sorry.\n\n730\n00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.730\nLet's clear that.\n\n731\n00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:02.270\nUptime is just a simple command to figure\nout how long your server's been running.\n\n732\n00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:05.759\nSo you can say, hey,\nwhy was this server rebooted an hour ago?\n\n733\n00:40:05.759 --> 00:40:08.380\nAll right, nobody should have\nbeen rebooting the system.\n\n734\n00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.610\nFree takes a look at your memory, so\n\n735\n00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:13.700\nyou can check for\na strange consumption of memory.\n\n736\n00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.190\nDF, again, looks at the file system.\n\n737\n00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:22.580\nSo I can look of percentage of utilization\nof this file systems, looking for\n\n738\n00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.870\nabnormal things, right?\n\n739\n00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.250\nWhy is that drive full?\n\n740\n00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.270\nWhy is that particular volume full,\nit really shouldn't be.\n\n741\n00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.690\nSo, hopefully again it gives you an idea\nof some of the commands that are built\n\n742\n00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:32.200\ninto our system.\n\n743\n00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.990\nNone of the stuff that we did here\nwas software that's been installed.\n\n744\n00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:38.740\nAll these commands were part of Windows,\npart of Linux.\n\n745\n00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.340\nThey're there for us to use to\nbegin that troubleshooting and\n\n746\n00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.120\nthat investigation process.\n\n747\n00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.560\n&gt;&gt; Man, three of my favorite tasks.\n\n748\n00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.190\nWatching paint dry, watching grass grow,\nand then searching system D, I mean,\n\n749\n00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.775\nsyslog files in Event Viewer.\n\n750\n00:40:50.775 --> 00:40:51.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My great job,\n\n751\n00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:57.470\nlots of information there, and lots stuff\nthat you guys can, you're taking a test,\n\n752\n00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:59.700\nbut it's nice to see some of\nthe things that you can take away and\n\n753\n00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.570\nyou can start to use in\nyour environment as well.\n\n754\n00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:04.530\nMike we appreciated having you hear,\nbut it does look like we've\n\n755\n00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.440\nrun the gamut on this one, so\nit's gonna be time to sign out.\n\n756\n00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.770\nWe do appreciate you\nguys watching out there.\n\n757\n00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:12.350\nMike before we depart do you\ngot any final words you might\n\n758\n00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:13.660\nlike to impart to our viewers?\n\n759\n00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the main thing is hopefully\nwhat we learned here is that\n\n760\n00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.840\nI need to be vigilant in my monitoring,\nright?\n\n761\n00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.530\nI need to understand what\ntools I have available, so\n\n762\n00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.980\nthat I can monitor and\nwhat I need to be looking for.\n\n763\n00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:30.410\nSo, take these commands and\nplay with them, learn them,\n\n764\n00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:34.130\nmake yourself a cheat sheet, whatever\nyou gotta do to remember some of those.\n\n765\n00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.720\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike we appreciate having\nyou here in the studio with us and\n\n766\n00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.880\nwe appreciate having you\nthe viewer watching.\n\n767\n00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.571\nSigning up for ITPro Tv,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan,\n\n768\n00:41:41.571 --> 00:41:42.322\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.947 --> 00:00:13.921\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n4\n00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:17.140\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.249\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:25.458\nwe are back with more On the A+, no, Net+,\nno, that's right, we've graduated to CSA+.\n\n7\n00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:29.127\nThat' where we are today and\nof course joining us back in the studio,\n\n8\n00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:33.130\nyet again, our good friend and\nmentor in that endeavor, Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.180\nMike, welcome back sir,\nglad to have you today.\n\n10\n00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.350\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much,\nexcited to be here, as always.\n\n11\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.834\nWe are gonna be doing some\npost-incident response.\n\n12\n00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:43.806\n[LAUGH] I almost read my old title.\n\n13\n00:00:43.806 --> 00:00:46.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, having fun here today.\n\n14\n00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.230\nYes, a post-incident response.\n\n15\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.104\nIf we look at the CompTIA objectives,\nsummarize the incident recovery and\n\n16\n00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:55.300\npost-incident response process.\n\n17\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.490\nSo, basically, talking about what\nis that process that we use.\n\n18\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.805\nI'll try to spice it up a little bit,\n\n19\n00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:05.533\nat least pull up one of our tools that\nwe can use to work through an incident.\n\n20\n00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:09.160\nSo, the first thing they call out,\ncall list escalation list.\n\n21\n00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.970\nAnd I know we've talked about this\nbefore but let's talk about it again.\n\n22\n00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.710\nWhen we talk about an incident response,\nwe need an incident response plan.\n\n23\n00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.700\nThere should be something,\n\n24\n00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.650\njust like all of our other policies,\nthat we come up with ahead of time, right?\n\n25\n00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.220\nWe get everybody together,\nwe talk about what we need and\n\n26\n00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.110\nwe decide on what our plan is going to be.\n\n27\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.920\nWe put that in writing,\nwe test it and we test it regularly.\n\n28\n00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.920\nWe update it regularly,\nbecause things change.\n\n29\n00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.780\nPart of that incident response plan\nis going to be our call list and\n\n30\n00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.270\nour escalation list.\n\n31\n00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.410\nAnd we need to be able to,\nwe need to know who should we notify?\n\n32\n00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.810\nAnd that can change, it's not just,\nokay if anything happens call Daniel.\n\n33\n00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.680\nI mean, that might be,\nyou might have a very small team and\n\n34\n00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.160\nthere's only one person and\nthat's who you call.\n\n35\n00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.590\nBut most of the time, you have different\nlevels of events that are gonna occur.\n\n36\n00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.860\nAnd In your plan it'll tell you\nwhat you're supposed to do.\n\n37\n00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.110\nDon't pull my screen up just yet, let me\nfind something real quick before I do.\n\n38\n00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.053\nI did find an example Of\n\n39\n00:02:14.053 --> 00:02:20.149\none that I could show you here on screen,\njust to give us something to look at.\n\n40\n00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:22.534\n800 of these guys, here we go.\n\n41\n00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:23.780\nLet me get that open up really quick.\n\n42\n00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.430\nOkay, go ahead, you can show my screen.\n\n43\n00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.991\nAnd this is one from, my gosh,\n\n44\n00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:34.030\nI can't remember who I got this from,\nI should give them credit.\n\n45\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.130\nBut this is basically an Escalation\nProcedures for Security Instance, right?\n\n46\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.408\nAnd you can see it's a template,\n\n47\n00:02:40.408 --> 00:02:43.040\nit's got this whole company name thing\nwe're supposed to go and fill out.\n\n48\n00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040\nAnd that's not the important part.\n\n49\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.945\nWhat I wanted to show you was\nthe way they work this out.\n\n50\n00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:48.452\nYou got your list of contacts.\n\n51\n00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:53.490\nIf there is a loss of personal password\nsheet, that's a level one incident.\n\n52\n00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.126\nNotify the CSA, that's our\ncomputer security analyst, right,\n\n53\n00:02:58.126 --> 00:02:59.880\nwithin one working day.\n\n54\n00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.910\nThe CSA will decide if password\nchanges are necessary.\n\n55\n00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.544\nIf there is a suspected sharing of\ncompany accounts, who do we notify?\n\n56\n00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:13.370\nThere's another one I really\nwanted to show you guys down here.\n\n57\n00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.980\nLet's see, suspected violation and\nspecial access, notify the CSA.\n\n58\n00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.850\nThe CSA, within that time will contact\nthe ISO, or the backup person for the CSA.\n\n59\n00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.900\nMajor violations, notify the CSA,\nthey'll notify the ISO, and\n\n60\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.410\nnotice they've got time frames in here.\n\n61\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.897\nWithin one hour for the CSA,\nwithin four hours for the ISO, right?\n\n62\n00:03:35.897 --> 00:03:40.649\nAnd there was another one in here where\nI found, where it starts to escalate and\n\n63\n00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:42.840\nnotify the ISO within one hour.\n\n64\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.640\nNotify all involved LSAs within two hours.\n\n65\n00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.370\nAnd it tells you what to do,\nhey while you're waiting for\n\n66\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.680\nthe LSA to respond, let's do this.\n\n67\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.090\nAnd again, this just an example,\njust a template.\n\n68\n00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.622\nI'm not saying this is\nwhat you have to do.\n\n69\n00:03:55.622 --> 00:03:59.538\nBut it gives us an idea of what we should\nbe thinking about when we're creating our\n\n70\n00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:00.540\ncall list.\n\n71\n00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.670\nWho is it I need to notify, right?\n\n72\n00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.600\nMost organizations have some\ntype of chain of command.\n\n73\n00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.020\nAnd when I suspect there's an incident,\nI don't immediately call the CEO and\n\n74\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.140\ntell him, hey look,\nI think there's been a breach, right?\n\n75\n00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.770\nAnd start the panic trickling\ndown from the top down.\n\n76\n00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.090\nCuz the CEO is gonna call the CIO, and\n\n77\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.810\nthe CIO is gonna go,\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n78\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.690\nI had no idea, how did this get to you and\nnot come through me, right?\n\n79\n00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.280\nWe didn't follow that chain of command.\n\n80\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.940\nSo, there's gonna be somebody\nthat I notify first.\n\n81\n00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.390\nAnd then, we're gonna determine\nif it's actually an incident and\n\n82\n00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.800\nwhat the level of severity\nof that incident was.\n\n83\n00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.600\nAnd then, from that point,\nwe determine who should be notified.\n\n84\n00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.798\nIt's probably not me anymore.\n\n85\n00:04:36.798 --> 00:04:40.716\nIf I've notified my next up in command,\naccording to my call list,\n\n86\n00:04:40.716 --> 00:04:45.206\ntheir job would then be to report to\nwhomever they're supposed to report to.\n\n87\n00:04:45.206 --> 00:04:48.890\nIf they determine that it's\nescalated to that level, right?\n\n88\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.390\nSo, in our call list we\nhave several things.\n\n89\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.460\nWe have all the points of contact,\nnumbers, alternate numbers,\n\n90\n00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.750\nways that we can get in touch.\n\n91\n00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.550\nRemember, not just an email address,\nwhat if the network's down?\n\n92\n00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.440\nWhat if the email's down?\n\n93\n00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.443\nWe need email addresses,\ncompany phone numbers, cell phone numbers,\n\n94\n00:05:04.443 --> 00:05:08.131\nif they've got them,\nmaybe home phone numbers even, all right?\n\n95\n00:05:08.131 --> 00:05:11.066\nSo, that if any of these other\ncommunication channels are unavailable,\n\n96\n00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:12.830\nwe have other means of\ntrying to get to them.\n\n97\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.620\nOr if they're not in the office that day,\n\n98\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.950\nwe have a way to try to\nget in touch with them.\n\n99\n00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.900\nBut the important thing to understand is,\nwhen something happens, there's definitely\n\n100\n00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.520\ngot to be a procedure in place for\nwho you're supposed to notify.\n\n101\n00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.880\nAnd then how it gets\nworked up the food chain.\n\n102\n00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.190\nI don't go tell the CEO every time\nthe printer runs out of paper, right?\n\n103\n00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.065\nThere's a procedure we go through.\n\n104\n00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:35.270\nSo, same thing for this kind of thing.\n\n105\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, plus you want to be able to make\nsure that you are covered as far as,\n\n106\n00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.110\nyou don't want to go in, he said,\nshe said, this, that, and the other.\n\n107\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.910\nWe want to be able to say, your job was\nto contact so and so, did you do that?\n\n108\n00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.410\nAnd just check that box off, yes I did.\n\n109\n00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.930\nI contacted them in compliance with\nour procedure, that we have in place,\n\n110\n00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.310\nthat everybody knows about,\nwe've gone through, we practice.\n\n111\n00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.196\nBecause what'll happen is,\n\n112\n00:06:02.196 --> 00:06:06.430\nis you'll make evidence unusable, because\nyou didn't follow proper procedure.\n\n113\n00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.130\nAnd that's exactly what\nyou don't wanna do.\n\n114\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.536\nSo, even if you can't find out,\n\n115\n00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:12.240\nif there's an incidence of\nsecurity breach of some sort.\n\n116\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.660\nAnd you can't find out who did it,\n\n117\n00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.450\nyou might not be able to prosecute them or\nrecover anything because of that.\n\n118\n00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.910\nSo following this procedure's very,\nvery important.\n\n119\n00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.507\nAnd that being said, Mike,\n\n120\n00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:27.112\nthere are suites available to us out there\nthat can help streamline this process.\n\n121\n00:06:27.112 --> 00:06:29.669\nAnd make sure that we don't\nforget anything, right,\n\n122\n00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.460\nthat we follow the proper procedure.\n\n123\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.580\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah, we got our\ninvestigation suites, our forensics tools.\n\n124\n00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.620\nWe've talked about a few of these.\n\n125\n00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.760\nLike EnCase, Autopsy,\nwhich we're gonna take a look at.\n\n126\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.690\nThe Sleuth Kit, Forensic Toolkit, FTK.\n\n127\n00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.264\nSeveral of them out there, some free,\nsome pay, that we can get access to.\n\n128\n00:06:48.264 --> 00:06:51.032\nAnd one more thing I want to throw\nin there about that call list too,\n\n129\n00:06:51.032 --> 00:06:54.150\nyou also need to think about,\nwhat if it's after hours or weekends.\n\n130\n00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.730\nThat might change who you notify and\nhow you go about notifying them.\n\n131\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.530\nOther things you might put in there are,\n\n132\n00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.010\nat some point in that call list\nprogression or at the escalation list\n\n133\n00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.160\nprogression, you might have law\nenforcement that needs to be notified.\n\n134\n00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.180\nLocal law enforcement,\n\n135\n00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.030\nyou might bring in governmental agencies\ndepending on the level of the breach.\n\n136\n00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.765\nBut again,\nthere's going to be a procedure for that.\n\n137\n00:07:15.765 --> 00:07:18.320\nUsually, it's not the first\nperson that finds it, right?\n\n138\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.050\nI'm going to notify somebody, it's going\nto go through that chain of command.\n\n139\n00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.661\nAnd somebody higher up,\ntypically one of those C levels,\n\n140\n00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:27.298\nmight be the ones that make the decision,\ndo we need to bring in law enforcement?\n\n141\n00:07:27.298 --> 00:07:30.921\nDo regulations say that we have\nto bring in law enforcement or\n\n142\n00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:33.910\ngovernmental agencies to\nlook at this incident.\n\n143\n00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.681\nIf the breach is true, if we actually did\nhave a breach,and we discover that they\n\n144\n00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:43.510\nhave potentially compromised\nHIPAA protected information, or\n\n145\n00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.383\nsome other regulatory\nprotected information.\n\n146\n00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:52.664\nThere might be that need to\nbring in those outside agencies.\n\n147\n00:07:52.664 --> 00:07:57.284\nOtherwise you could end up paying\nfines for not following that.\n\n148\n00:07:57.284 --> 00:08:00.003\nAll right, so as Daniel was saying, yeah,\n\n149\n00:08:00.003 --> 00:08:04.200\nthere are what we call\nforensic investigation suites.\n\n150\n00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.704\nI mentioned EnCase, FTK,\nSleuth Kit, Autopsy,\n\n151\n00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:13.117\nwhich is kind of a GUI front end for\nthe Sleuth Kit.\n\n152\n00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:15.274\nLots of them available out there.\n\n153\n00:08:15.274 --> 00:08:18.419\nWhat you're gonna look for\nis how much it costs, right,\n\n154\n00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:22.940\nhow much you're willing to spend on it,\nand whether or not it's something that is\n\n155\n00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.428\naccepted by the local court\nsystems wherever you happen to be.\n\n156\n00:08:26.428 --> 00:08:31.757\nThat's always very important, making sure\nthat you don't wanna waste your time.\n\n157\n00:08:31.757 --> 00:08:36.161\nI shouldn't say waste your time, but\nyou don't wanna spend a lot of time using\n\n158\n00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:39.096\na tool, gathering evidence,\ndoing analysis, and\n\n159\n00:08:39.096 --> 00:08:43.254\ncome to find out it has known issues,\nor it's not accepted by the courts.\n\n160\n00:08:43.254 --> 00:08:46.657\nAnd so now all your evidence\ncould potentially be unusable or\n\n161\n00:08:46.657 --> 00:08:51.194\ninadmissible if you're not careful, so\nmake sure that you do your due diligence\n\n162\n00:08:51.194 --> 00:08:55.020\nwhen choosing a tool, depending on\nwhat it is you're trying to do.\n\n163\n00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.797\nIf you're just trying to learn,\nget certified or something like that,\n\n164\n00:08:57.797 --> 00:08:58.627\nit doesn't matter.\n\n165\n00:08:58.627 --> 00:09:02.643\nBut if you are using this in\nan organization where you intend\n\n166\n00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:06.917\nto prosecute, using the right\ntool is definitely important.\n\n167\n00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:08.070\nAll right, so\n\n168\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.651\nlet's take a look at an example of\na forensics investigation suite.\n\n169\n00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:18.103\nI've got it set up, really haven't\ndone a lot of configuration to it, but\n\n170\n00:09:18.103 --> 00:09:19.600\nwe'll take a peek here.\n\n171\n00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.175\nMake that a little bigger, cuz I know what\nDaniel's gonna say, I can't see that.\n\n172\n00:09:25.175 --> 00:09:26.288\n&gt;&gt; I'm blind man, come on.\n\n173\n00:09:26.288 --> 00:09:30.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\nhopefully that's good enough.\n\n174\n00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.520\nFrom here all I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna launch Autopsy.\n\n175\n00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:40.380\nAll right, and what this does it\nstarts a process in the background and\n\n176\n00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.959\nit includes a web interface.\n\n177\n00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:46.530\nSo it is now listening as you\ncan see here on port 9999.\n\n178\n00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:52.040\nI just now realized that that was\nactually a clickable link, interesting.\n\n179\n00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.441\nBut anyway,\nwe'll just open up our favorite browser.\n\n180\n00:09:56.441 --> 00:10:03.817\nhttp://localhost/autopsy.\n\n181\n00:10:06.594 --> 00:10:09.875\nI'm sorry, not autopsy, localhost:9.\n\n182\n00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.791\nSilly number lock.\n\n183\n00:10:13.791 --> 00:10:14.818\n&gt;&gt; Gets you every time, doesn't it?\n\n184\n00:10:14.818 --> 00:10:17.845\n&gt;&gt; It does, every time I switch virtual\nmachines it seems to switch itself.\n\n185\n00:10:17.845 --> 00:10:21.525\nI know it's in my history, but I like to\ntype it out for the good folks out there.\n\n186\n00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:28.079\nhttp://localhost:9999/autopsy and\n\n187\n00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:34.316\nit brings me to this\nwonderful web interface.\n\n188\n00:10:34.316 --> 00:10:38.074\nAll right, tell me I have JavaScript\nenabled and that's a bad thing.\n\n189\n00:10:38.074 --> 00:10:40.748\nBut we'll keep going anyway.\n\n190\n00:10:40.748 --> 00:10:45.060\nAll right, so this is Autopsy Forensic\nBrowser and basically like I said,\n\n191\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.590\nit's a kind of a GUI front end for\nSleuth Kit.\n\n192\n00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.680\nAnd down here at the bottom,\nI've got a couple of options,\n\n193\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.890\nthe one right there in\nthe middle is a new case.\n\n194\n00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.610\nSo I'm gonna click on New Case and\nI'll enter a case number.\n\n195\n00:11:00.383 --> 00:11:03.460\nWe plan to have a lot of cases so\nI'll put a lot of zeros out there.\n\n196\n00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.649\n&gt;&gt; Everybody's gotta start somewhere,\nright?\n\n197\n00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:07.379\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] this is our test case.\n\n198\n00:11:07.379 --> 00:11:10.843\nThen you would put down\nthe investigators' names,\n\n199\n00:11:10.843 --> 00:11:13.920\ndepending on who's gonna\nbe working on this.\n\n200\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.450\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna crack this case, Mike.\n\n201\n00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:15.992\n&gt;&gt; I hope so.\n\n202\n00:11:15.992 --> 00:11:17.944\nWe can get good money with this one.\n\n203\n00:11:17.944 --> 00:11:22.394\nWe'll click New Case and tells me\nthat a case directory was created.\n\n204\n00:11:22.394 --> 00:11:24.790\nI've got my configuration file for\nthe case.\n\n205\n00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.180\nAnd now we gotta create a host for\nthis case.\n\n206\n00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.690\nSo select my name from the list and\nI'll add me as the host.\n\n207\n00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:39.656\nAnd let's see, we'll call this one,\nwhich one are we gonna do?\n\n208\n00:11:39.656 --> 00:11:42.514\nWe'll call it Host 1,\nwe'll be really fancy.\n\n209\n00:11:42.514 --> 00:11:44.908\nAnd I'll just call this Test.\n\n210\n00:11:44.908 --> 00:11:48.364\nThat's fine, time zone.\n\n211\n00:11:48.364 --> 00:11:50.370\nAnd again,\nit'll default to the local settings.\n\n212\n00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.180\nWe can add that in there if\nwe need to do a time skew.\n\n213\n00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.340\nI'm gonna skip past all this.\n\n214\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.282\nPath of Alert Hash Database,\n\n215\n00:11:56.282 --> 00:12:01.184\nI don't have a hash database of known\nbad files or any that I need to ignore.\n\n216\n00:12:01.184 --> 00:12:03.600\nSo we'll just go ahead and click Add Host.\n\n217\n00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.115\nNext thing we're gonna do, so\nwhat we're doing, remember,\n\n218\n00:12:05.115 --> 00:12:06.012\nthink about what we're doing here.\n\n219\n00:12:06.012 --> 00:12:08.809\nThis is an incident response.\n\n220\n00:12:08.809 --> 00:12:11.743\nWe've got a system that we\nwanna do some forensics on.\n\n221\n00:12:11.743 --> 00:12:13.664\nSo I've created a new case.\n\n222\n00:12:13.664 --> 00:12:17.616\nThat case is basically my folder\nthat all of my stuff goes in for\n\n223\n00:12:17.616 --> 00:12:19.140\nthis particular case.\n\n224\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.169\nI might have several cases that\nI'm working on at the same time.\n\n225\n00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:24.436\nAnd I've gotta keep everything organized.\n\n226\n00:12:24.436 --> 00:12:31.741\nSo we create a case for laptop 01 that\nwe're investigating from company XYZ.\n\n227\n00:12:31.741 --> 00:12:32.775\nSo we've set all that up,\n\n228\n00:12:32.775 --> 00:12:35.932\nwe've said who are the people that are\ngonna have access to this are going to be.\n\n229\n00:12:35.932 --> 00:12:38.596\nThen we're going to add our image.\n\n230\n00:12:38.596 --> 00:12:42.226\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna click Add Image File and\n\n231\n00:12:42.226 --> 00:12:47.644\nwe'll have to tell it where our file is so\nwe'll see if we can get over there.\n\n232\n00:12:47.644 --> 00:12:51.880\nThat is not the one I want to use, Mike,\nthat was the one that wasn't there.\n\n233\n00:12:51.880 --> 00:13:00.330\nSo we'll do amount/images/image/01.img.\n\n234\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.360\nOops, I didn't really wanna hit that yet.\n\n235\n00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.230\nSo I've told it where the image is,\nright, and as I scroll down,\n\n236\n00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:07.160\nwhat is this an image of?\n\n237\n00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.091\nCuz this could be an image of\njust a partition off of a drive,\n\n238\n00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:11.216\ncould be a full drive.\n\n239\n00:13:11.216 --> 00:13:14.200\nThis is a full disk image,\nso I'll tell it it's a disk.\n\n240\n00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:20.124\nAnd then my import method, it needs\nto be located in the evidence locker.\n\n241\n00:13:20.124 --> 00:13:23.569\nBut it can be done using a symbolic\nlink because it's not on another\n\n242\n00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.857\nmachine anywhere, not on external drive.\n\n243\n00:13:25.857 --> 00:13:28.536\nIn this case, it's on a second\nhard drive in this machine.\n\n244\n00:13:28.536 --> 00:13:32.364\nSo I don't need to copy it anywhere,\nmove it,\n\n245\n00:13:32.364 --> 00:13:36.692\nI am just going to do a symlink and\nwe'll click Next.\n\n246\n00:13:36.692 --> 00:13:40.226\nNow remember we've talked about\nif you're working with an image,\n\n247\n00:13:40.226 --> 00:13:43.710\nif you're doing forensics,\nit's gotta be forensically sound.\n\n248\n00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.330\nAnd that means we have to\nmake sure we can prove\n\n249\n00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.920\nthat we haven't modified that image in\nany way doing our forensic investigation.\n\n250\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.110\nSo, how do we do that?\n\n251\n00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.303\nWell, hashing, right?\n\n252\n00:13:53.303 --> 00:13:55.080\nWe've talked hashing algorithms.\n\n253\n00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.890\nWe know that we can run\na hashing algorithm over\n\n254\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.040\na file including an image like\nthis generates a hash value.\n\n255\n00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.070\nThat hash value every time I run\nit through that hashing algorithm,\n\n256\n00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:09.202\nit should always output the exact same\nhash value unless something's changed.\n\n257\n00:14:09.202 --> 00:14:12.190\nThen that'll be different and\nwe know we've lost our integrity.\n\n258\n00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.838\nSo it's asking me data integrity\nMD5 hash can be used to verify.\n\n259\n00:14:16.838 --> 00:14:19.384\nWe can say calculate the value for\nthis hash or\n\n260\n00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:22.202\nadd the following MD5 hash value for\nthis image.\n\n261\n00:14:22.202 --> 00:14:28.940\nNow, I have the MD5 hash value\nbecause I just created this image.\n\n262\n00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.188\nSo right here and let's go ahead and\ntalk about this for a second.\n\n263\n00:14:32.188 --> 00:14:38.682\nI'll blow this up and we'll make that\na hair bigger for you guys out there.\n\n264\n00:14:38.682 --> 00:14:41.722\nAnd so this is the command I use.\n\n265\n00:14:41.722 --> 00:14:43.950\nThis is DCFLDD.\n\n266\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.406\nThis was Nicholas Harbour at\nthe Defense Computer Forensics Lab.\n\n267\n00:14:47.406 --> 00:14:49.670\nIt's just a version of DDE.\n\n268\n00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.601\nWe've talked about that the other day.\n\n269\n00:14:51.601 --> 00:14:54.784\nThat's a little more forensically sound,\nhas a few more capabilities in it.\n\n270\n00:14:54.784 --> 00:14:59.172\nJust about every, a large portion\nof the imagers that you see, tools,\n\n271\n00:14:59.172 --> 00:15:02.259\nare really based off of DDE in some way or\nanother.\n\n272\n00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:04.457\nAnd then I've got my input.\n\n273\n00:15:04.457 --> 00:15:07.427\nIt's coming from,\nI just did my own local drive here.\n\n274\n00:15:07.427 --> 00:15:10.807\nI told it to take a hash,\nand you'll just use MD5.\n\n275\n00:15:10.807 --> 00:15:14.911\nAnd then my output file,\nthe image told it where I want to put it,\n\n276\n00:15:14.911 --> 00:15:16.356\nwhat I want to call it.\n\n277\n00:15:16.356 --> 00:15:20.276\nMy block size as it's copying it over,\nI set to 512.\n\n278\n00:15:20.276 --> 00:15:24.692\nAnd then I also told it to sync no error,\nwhich is, and you can look up the help\n\n279\n00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:29.389\nfile on these tools, there's a lot of\nother commands you can use and might need.\n\n280\n00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:35.133\nBut this one basically is saying if\nthere's any read errors, keep on going.\n\n281\n00:15:35.133 --> 00:15:40.121\nIt allows me to get any slack space or\nother space in there that it might\n\n282\n00:15:40.121 --> 00:15:44.776\ntry to error out on if it was doing\njust a normal imaging process.\n\n283\n00:15:44.776 --> 00:15:47.293\nAt the bottom it tells me,\nrecords in, records out but\n\n284\n00:15:47.293 --> 00:15:49.220\nhere's what I'm actually looking for.\n\n285\n00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:54.663\nThere's the MD5, so it calculated the hash\non the image that it just created.\n\n286\n00:15:54.663 --> 00:15:59.193\nSo I need to take that All right,\nwe're gonna copy that and\n\n287\n00:15:59.193 --> 00:16:02.530\nwe'll jump back over to our browser here.\n\n288\n00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.780\nI'm gonna add the following\nMB5 hash value for the image.\n\n289\n00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.610\nI'll paste it.\n\n290\n00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.160\nAnd let's go ahead and\nverify that hash after importing.\n\n291\n00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.970\nI need to make sure that I\nhaven't goofed up already.\n\n292\n00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.950\nAnd somehow modified this drive just\nby adding it to this case cuz if I was\n\n293\n00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.550\ncopying it from, let's say,\n\n294\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.390\none of the other investigators brought\nme this image on a portable hard drive.\n\n295\n00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.720\nAnd I had to copy it over to\nmy forensics workstation.\n\n296\n00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.252\nSo instead of doing symlink, I chose Move.\n\n297\n00:16:30.252 --> 00:16:32.610\nSomething could've happened during\nthat move process, a bit or\n\n298\n00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.310\ntwo gets flipped and\nall of a sudden it won't match anymore.\n\n299\n00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:40.020\nI need to know now before I spend days,\nweeks doing my analysis.\n\n300\n00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.990\nCome to find out it was no\ngood from the beginning.\n\n301\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.470\n&gt;&gt; You'd have to throw that\nin the garbage, right?\n\n302\n00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:47.300\nI can't imagine any time where you would\nnot want this, well maybe testing or\n\n303\n00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.510\nsomething like that or\nif the drive didn't matter.\n\n304\n00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.600\nBut I would think that that verification\nwould be the default seeing as\n\n305\n00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.230\nwhat we're engaging in,\nwhat this tool does for us.\n\n306\n00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.900\nI would think that that\nwould be the default.\n\n307\n00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:58.982\nBut they didn't ask me, so.\n\n308\n00:16:58.982 --> 00:16:59.494\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n309\n00:16:59.494 --> 00:17:01.044\n&gt;&gt; Next time though, hopefully they will.\n\n310\n00:17:01.044 --> 00:17:02.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, so\n\n311\n00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.790\nthen down below there I can\nsee file system details.\n\n312\n00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:08.100\nIt's telling me what it\nalready sees in that image.\n\n313\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.510\nAnd we'll go ahead and click Add.\n\n314\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.050\nAnd it's gonna calculate that.\n\n315\n00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.780\nNow, it's gonna take a little bit,\nit is about a 30-something gig image, so\n\n316\n00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.750\nit'll take it a minute\nwhile it's doing that.\n\n317\n00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.840\nWhile it's doing that,\nthough, let's continue on and\n\n318\n00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.940\ntalk about a few other things that we need\nto round out for this particular episode.\n\n319\n00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.540\nOther things that go on during\na post-incident response, right?\n\n320\n00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.500\nChain of custody.\n\n321\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.520\nI know we've talked about that,\nbut again, let's rehash, right?\n\n322\n00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.360\nWhen we're gathering evidence,\nit's very important that we use and\n\n323\n00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.990\nfollow a chain of custody.\n\n324\n00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.040\nChain of custody just means as\nthat evidence is collected and\n\n325\n00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.480\nbrought back to wherever we're\ngonna do the analysis and\n\n326\n00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.970\npeople are working on that evidence, they\nare checking it in and checking it out.\n\n327\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.540\nEvery step has to be documented.\n\n328\n00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.240\nAll right, Daniel,\n\n329\n00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.660\nin the field did the initial gathering\nof that hard drive out of that computer.\n\n330\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.510\nBagged it, tagged it,\nevidence number, signed by Daniel.\n\n331\n00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.620\nHe transports is back\nto the evidence room.\n\n332\n00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.770\nThe evidence person then accepts\nthat evidence in, and signs off.\n\n333\n00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.050\nDaniel's no longer responsible for\nthat evidence.\n\n334\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.720\nThere's a signature says okay, now the\nevidence clerk has that, that gets put in.\n\n335\n00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.830\nWhen I get ready to do my analysis on that\ndrive, I go down and I check that out.\n\n336\n00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.120\nThat evidence clerk is\ngonna go get that drive,\n\n337\n00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.980\nand he's gonna make me sign that chain of\ncustody, right there in front of them,\n\n338\n00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.780\nmaking sure that I've put my\nJohn Hancock on there, my date and time.\n\n339\n00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.680\nAnd now I'm the one that's responsible for\nthat drive.\n\n340\n00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.140\nAnd when I bring it back,\nI'll check it back in.\n\n341\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:40.270\nBecause if you don't have that,\njust a too easy of a way for\n\n342\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.160\nthe defense to say all right,\nwell that's inadmissible.\n\n343\n00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.940\nYou can't prove where the drive was for\n36 hours.\n\n344\n00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.050\nSo we have no idea if it was modified,\nchanged, what have you, right?\n\n345\n00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.960\nSo, doing that chain of custody,\nhashing utilities.\n\n346\n00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.140\nWe just saw that.\n\n347\n00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.350\nUsing whatever it is, MD5, SHA1.\n\n348\n00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:03.110\nAnd I understand that like recently,\nif you're watching this,\n\n349\n00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:07.460\nMD5 has been shown to\nhave some collisions.\n\n350\n00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:14.610\nBut, in this case, we're not using it\nto really protect anything, right?\n\n351\n00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.090\nIt's not that I'm worried about,\n\n352\n00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:21.890\nlike if I was downloading, I don't know,\njust a simple example, an Linux ISO,\n\n353\n00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:26.900\nand I needed to make sure that\nit was downloaded completely and\n\n354\n00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.140\nno malware inserted in there before\nI downloaded it from that mirror.\n\n355\n00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.940\nI wanna use a good checksum\nthat's one that can't be faked,\n\n356\n00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.390\nthat's gonna be important to me.\n\n357\n00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.370\nIf we're doing this on files that\nare important for our organization,\n\n358\n00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:44.230\nthis is how we maintain that data\nintegrity, need to be using a good one.\n\n359\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.900\nFor this one, though,\nI mean to me, MD5 is okay,\n\n360\n00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.394\ncuz it, whether it's breakable or\nnot is not really what I'm trying to do.\n\n361\n00:19:51.394 --> 00:19:52.878\nI'm trying to prove data integrity.\n\n362\n00:19:52.878 --> 00:19:55.248\n&gt;&gt; Right, that seems to be\nthe common theme as, I mean,\n\n363\n00:19:55.248 --> 00:19:56.575\nlooking at chain of custody.\n\n364\n00:19:56.575 --> 00:19:58.090\nWhat is the purpose of chain of custody?\n\n365\n00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.588\nTo maintain the integrity of the evidence,\nright?\n\n366\n00:20:00.588 --> 00:20:03.197\nThat it doesn't fall into\nsomebody else's hands or\n\n367\n00:20:03.197 --> 00:20:06.590\nthere was a time when someone had\nno idea of where this evidence was.\n\n368\n00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.867\nIt maintains the integrity.\n\n369\n00:20:07.867 --> 00:20:09.493\nWe use a hashing algorithm, why?\n\n370\n00:20:09.493 --> 00:20:13.328\nTo verify the integrity of the drive,\nof the file, of the whatever,\n\n371\n00:20:13.328 --> 00:20:17.034\nso that we can make sure that when\nwe admit that as evidence, that it\n\n372\n00:20:17.034 --> 00:20:22.040\nhasn't been tampered with, it hasn't been\nchanged, and anybody can verify that.\n\n373\n00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:22.700\nSo like Mike says,\n\n374\n00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.580\nit doesn't matter that there might\nbe some collisions inside of MD5.\n\n375\n00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.280\nThat's not the purpose we're using it for.\n\n376\n00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.410\nWe're just purposing it for\nthe means of integrity, verifying that.\n\n377\n00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:33.200\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n378\n00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.699\nNow it might come to a point\none day where the courts or\n\n379\n00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:39.600\nthe legal system says that's\nnot good enough, right?\n\n380\n00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.368\nWe need a different checksum,\nwe need to use something else but for now,\n\n381\n00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:44.700\nMD5 is fine.\n\n382\n00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.900\nOther things, OS and process analysis,\nobviously, very important as we're\n\n383\n00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:53.510\ndoing our forensic investigation that we\nexamine the computer, the operating system\n\n384\n00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:57.660\nthat it's running, the processes that\nare running on that system using\n\n385\n00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:02.600\ndifferent tools, Task Manager on a Windows\nsystem but that's a little limited.\n\n386\n00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.650\nYou can get Process Explorer,\nit's a Sysinternals tool.\n\n387\n00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:08.870\nSeveral on the Linux side that we can get.\n\n388\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.950\nThey give us a lot more information\nabout what processes and\n\n389\n00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.170\npotentially some hidden processes\nwe didn't see in Task Manager.\n\n390\n00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:20.200\nMobile device forensics is a huge field\nright now because of the fact that mobile\n\n391\n00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.940\ndevices are so prevalent and we're seeing\nthem more and more in the workplace.\n\n392\n00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.970\nAnd we're actually using them for work.\n\n393\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.910\nI mean, how many of you out there have\na tablet that you can use to remote\n\n394\n00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.410\ninto your computers at\nwork when you need to?\n\n395\n00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.400\nAll right, or you're moving data and\n\n396\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.230\nfiles between your,\nmaybe taking stuff home to work on.\n\n397\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:43.690\nSo mobile device forensics is becoming,\nit's an avenue in, it's an attack vector.\n\n398\n00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.470\nSo I'm gonna need to be able to\ndo forensics on mobile devices.\n\n399\n00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.780\nThat's gonna mean new software\nthat's capable of working with that.\n\n400\n00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.590\nIt's gonna mean new connectivity methods.\n\n401\n00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.800\nI've gotta make sure I can connect\nto these different mobile devices.\n\n402\n00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.370\nAlso brings in an interesting\nproblem is power.\n\n403\n00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:03.725\nSo providing power for those guys,\nmaking sure that the battery doesn't die.\n\n404\n00:22:03.725 --> 00:22:05.360\nt's's still keeping integrity.\n\n405\n00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.470\nThere's a lot of interesting things that\nhave to do with mobile device forensics.\n\n406\n00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:13.680\nPassword crackers,\ndepending on what we're trying to do.\n\n407\n00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.210\nLoftcracked, Ophcrack, Cain and Abel,\n\n408\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.860\nJack the Ripper, lots of different\npassword crackers out there.\n\n409\n00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.830\nBut we might need to, what if the system\nis password protected, right?\n\n410\n00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.550\nAnd I need to try to somehow\nget into that system.\n\n411\n00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:29.150\nI might need a way to\ndo password cracking.\n\n412\n00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.209\nSame thing with cryptography tools,\n\n413\n00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:37.520\nI might need to work with\ndrives that are protected.\n\n414\n00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.810\nSo is there, how do I,\n\n415\n00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:44.490\ncan I recover BitLocker passwords from\nsomewhere to try to decrypt that drive?\n\n416\n00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.260\nAnd then log viewers.\n\n417\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.797\nWe looked at several SIEM systems, or\ntalked about several SIEM systems,\n\n418\n00:22:50.797 --> 00:22:54.530\nthat'll let me correlate logs,\npull all that information in.\n\n419\n00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:58.150\nThere's others out there where if I've\ndone a dump of logs from a system,\n\n420\n00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.032\nI can go through and\ntry to analyze those logs.\n\n421\n00:23:01.032 --> 00:23:03.440\nAll right, let's go back to my\nscreen here and take a look.\n\n422\n00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.190\nIt did finish my MD5 and\nit says everything passed.\n\n423\n00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.040\nIntegrity check passed and\n\n424\n00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.890\nit's basically checking that\nimage into the evidence locker.\n\n425\n00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.120\nThat gives me an image ID of IMG1.\n\n426\n00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.420\nAnd so I'm gonna go ahead and click OK.\n\n427\n00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.581\nThe entire image is image 1, then I got\nmy different volumes, volume 2, volume 3,\n\n428\n00:23:22.581 --> 00:23:23.610\nthere and volume 1.\n\n429\n00:23:25.167 --> 00:23:26.845\nAll right, we'll click OK.\n\n430\n00:23:26.845 --> 00:23:30.245\nAnd there we go, so\nnow I've brought that in.\n\n431\n00:23:30.245 --> 00:23:33.605\nWhat else do we wanna take\na look at while we're here?\n\n432\n00:23:33.605 --> 00:23:37.995\nI mean, we're not gonna actually go and\nstart doing any analysis on this but\n\n433\n00:23:37.995 --> 00:23:41.707\nthis is just an example\nof a forensics tool kit.\n\n434\n00:23:41.707 --> 00:23:43.467\nAnd you can see how we\nstart building up the case.\n\n435\n00:23:43.467 --> 00:23:47.468\nAnd the next thing I might wanna do\nis start my analysis on this drive.\n\n436\n00:23:47.468 --> 00:23:51.090\nI can get details about this drive.\n\n437\n00:23:52.984 --> 00:23:54.748\nI wanna close that whole thing,\nthere we go.\n\n438\n00:23:54.748 --> 00:23:58.208\nWe'll go ahead and click analyze\non here just to kinda give you.\n\n439\n00:23:58.208 --> 00:24:03.595\nSee that's gonna 2000 tabs above.\n\n440\n00:24:03.595 --> 00:24:05.125\nLet's do the image details.\n\n441\n00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:07.060\nBut, you can see my options up here.\n\n442\n00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.278\nHopefully you can see,\ncan you guys read that?\n\n443\n00:24:09.278 --> 00:24:10.890\nIt's a weird color up here.\n\n444\n00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:15.230\nI've got file analysis, keyword search,\nfile type, image details, meta data,\n\n445\n00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.810\ndata unit help and close.\n\n446\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.170\nSo depending on what I had\nselected on the previous screen,\n\n447\n00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.950\nwhat volume, would determine\nwhat I can choose up there.\n\n448\n00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:27.160\nYou can see I can only do\nkeyword search and image files.\n\n449\n00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.348\nOr image details,\nwe can do keyword search.\n\n450\n00:24:29.348 --> 00:24:33.307\nMaybe I wanna search\nthrough that drive for,\n\n451\n00:24:33.307 --> 00:24:39.986\nI'm just gonna put something random here,\nsecret or something like that.\n\n452\n00:24:39.986 --> 00:24:43.076\nBut maybe there's something in\nparticular that you're looking for,\n\n453\n00:24:43.076 --> 00:24:45.135\nthat you suspected this\nemployee was doing, or\n\n454\n00:24:45.135 --> 00:24:48.570\nthat this bad guy was doing while\nthey were compromising that machine.\n\n455\n00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.490\nI can start scanning through there and\nfinding that information,\n\n456\n00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:55.498\nso, very powerful tool, again, just one.\n\n457\n00:24:55.498 --> 00:24:57.720\nYou also have your image\nintegrity down here.\n\n458\n00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.470\nIt gives you a way to keep notes,\nI can close this particular host,\n\n459\n00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.080\nI can add another host.\n\n460\n00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.590\nThere might be more than one node\ninvolved in this investigation.\n\n461\n00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.070\nAnd I can see who they're gonna pick my,\nwho my investigator's gonna be,\n\n462\n00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.780\nand then at some point.\n\n463\n00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.340\nI closed the case, when we're done\nwe've turned all over all the evidence,\n\n464\n00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.910\nthe court has done its thing and\nthe case is done.\n\n465\n00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:22.503\nWe closed the case and\nwe move on to the next one.\n\n466\n00:25:22.503 --> 00:25:26.275\nSo, you know, that's the idea\nbehind a forensic investigations.\n\n467\n00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:30.244\nAnd hopefully through this episode,\nwe kinda showed you or talked about,\n\n468\n00:25:30.244 --> 00:25:34.528\nthe basic process that we go through,\nof doing a forensic investigation post and\n\n469\n00:25:34.528 --> 00:25:35.672\ninstance response.\n\n470\n00:25:35.672 --> 00:25:38.837\nThat's, you know, gathering your evidence,\ndoing your analysis, and your evidence.\n\n471\n00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:42.750\nAnd the big thing is documenting\neverything, making sure you that you've\n\n472\n00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:47.460\ngot a tool like this to help you organize\nit, it can be extremely beneficial.\n\n473\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.908\nYou have to use something like this,\n\n474\n00:25:48.908 --> 00:25:52.740\nI mean, you can't do all of this\nstuff without a tool like this.\n\n475\n00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:56.680\nIf you're the old pencil and paper kind\nof person then maybe that's your thing.\n\n476\n00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that might be your thing.\n\n477\n00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.880\nBut I'll tell you what,\nthese things are whole lot nicer to use.\n\n478\n00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.705\nHelps you keep everything organized.\n\n479\n00:26:02.705 --> 00:26:05.440\nAn organization is\nthe key when it comes to,\n\n480\n00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.770\nrunning some sort of digital forensics and\nanalysis.\n\n481\n00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:13.410\nWanna make sure every I or lower case\nj is dotted and all T's are crossed.\n\n482\n00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.580\nThat being said, Mike, anything else\nwe need to cover for this objective for\n\n483\n00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:17.370\nthe CSA plus?\n\n484\n00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.050\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so,\nI think we got it all.\n\n485\n00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.250\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nWell,\n\n486\n00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.590\nlooks like it's about that time everyone.\n\n487\n00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:26.040\nThanks for joining us but, signing off for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n488\n00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:26.840\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n489\n00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.357\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n490\n00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:35.669\n[MUSIC]\n\n491\n00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:37.400\nThank you for watching, ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:15.980\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst + show.\n\n5\n00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.369\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.900\nFor all you rebels out there, this episode\nmight be a hard pill to swallow because\n\n7\n00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.260\nwell, we're gonna be looking\nat frameworks, policies and\n\n8\n00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.230\ncontrols throughout the entire show.\n\n9\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.050\nAnd who better to help us with that\nthan Mr. Mike Rodrick himself..\n\n10\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.670\nThank you for joining us today Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.725\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] How you doing, Cherokee?\n\n12\n00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:33.670\nThanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.330\nYeah, I'm ready to bore you to death\nwith the policies and framework.\n\n14\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.518\nNo all kidding aside,\nobviously a very important part of one,\n\n15\n00:00:40.518 --> 00:00:44.262\npassing the exam because that is\nsomething I'm sure most of us want to do.\n\n16\n00:00:44.262 --> 00:00:45.988\nAnd once we get out in the real world,\n\n17\n00:00:45.988 --> 00:00:49.566\nit is important that we understand\nthe frameworks that are available to us.\n\n18\n00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:53.792\nAnd we have to do our due diligence to\nmake sure if we're gonna use a framework,\n\n19\n00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:58.820\nfind out which one is best for us, and\nour organization and put them into place.\n\n20\n00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.770\nAnd so even though it might not be\nthe most exciting thing in the world,\n\n21\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.110\ndepending on who you are I guess.\n\n22\n00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.380\nSome people, I kinda like some\nof this stuff, but yeah, so\n\n23\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.040\nnot a lot of exciting,\ncool demos to do with frameworks.\n\n24\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.330\nBut let's start off with talking about\nsomething known as regulatory compliance.\n\n25\n00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.720\nIt is something they call\nout on the objectives.\n\n26\n00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.810\nIt is something that we\nneed to be familiar with,\n\n27\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.080\nbut we've kind of already talked about\nthis in other episodes when Wes was here.\n\n28\n00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.890\nWe talked about how part of our job in IT,\nespecially in IT security, is to make sure\n\n29\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.770\nwe understand what regulations are\navailable for us in our industry, right?\n\n30\n00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.210\nDifferent industries,\ndifferent regulations.\n\n31\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.420\nAnd nobody comes up to us and\n\n32\n00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.060\nsays, hey, you need to make sure you're\nfollowing this regulation, right?\n\n33\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.820\nWe have to do our due diligence,\nand find those out.\n\n34\n00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.680\nNow, hopefully there'll be somebody in\nthe organization that already knows and\n\n35\n00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.420\nwe'll just do our research, make sure\nwe don't need to add anything, but\n\n36\n00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.920\nit is something we have to do.\n\n37\n00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.880\n&gt;&gt; Usually people don't let you know\nwhen you're doing things right.\n\n38\n00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.764\nIt's when things go wrong is whenever\nyou're aware of them, right?\n\n39\n00:01:57.764 --> 00:01:58.922\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n40\n00:01:58.922 --> 00:02:01.070\nWhen you have to pay that fine and\nyou go wow.\n\n41\n00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.300\nI really wish I would have\nknown about this ahead of time.\n\n42\n00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.440\nSo that's why we try to\nfind out ahead of time.\n\n43\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.070\nBut anyway, when we talk about regulatory\ncompliance, following laws, regulations,\n\n44\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.500\nguidelines, and\nspecifications relative to business.\n\n45\n00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.400\nAnd again, that's a key point there,\n\n46\n00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.827\nnot all regulations will\napply to your industry.\n\n47\n00:02:17.827 --> 00:02:21.515\nHIPAA for example we're familiar with\nthe Healthcare Information Portability,\n\n48\n00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:25.141\n&gt;&gt; Privacy Act?\n\n49\n00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:26.058\n&gt;&gt; What's it?\n\n50\n00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:26.654\nPrivacy Act, [SOUND], brain cramp there.\n\n51\n00:02:26.654 --> 00:02:27.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Something like that, yeah.\n\n52\n00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.975\n&gt;&gt; If I'm a, I don't know,\nan automotive mechanic shop,\n\n53\n00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:37.980\nI probably don't have to\nfollow those regulations.\n\n54\n00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.520\nI might have customer data.\n\n55\n00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.430\nBut it's not health care information, so\nI don't have any of those same concerns.\n\n56\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.590\nSo I don't have to spend the money to\nbe compliant with those particular\n\n57\n00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.360\nregulations.\n\n58\n00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.980\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike,\nI gotta go ahead and say.\n\n59\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.190\nIt's Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act.\n\n60\n00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.291\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I always forget\nit's insurance, not information.\n\n61\n00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:56.909\nBecause literally-\n&gt;&gt; Here I am saying privacy.\n\n62\n00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.757\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah we talked about\n\n63\n00:02:58.757 --> 00:02:59.592\nthat in another episode.\n\n64\n00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:01.381\nRemember there were two parts to HIPAA.\n\n65\n00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:04.108\nOne part does deal with\ninsurance portability.\n\n66\n00:03:04.108 --> 00:03:07.822\nIf I work for one organization and I'm\ninsured, I go to another organization and\n\n67\n00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:11.426\nthey try to throw some of those\npre-existing conditions, things like that,\n\n68\n00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:12.680\nmakes it easy to switch.\n\n69\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.350\nNone of which has anything to do with this\nexam or what we need to know because it's\n\n70\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.510\nthe other part of HIPAA\nthat we're concerned with.\n\n71\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.920\nBut as far as the regulatory compliance,\ntypically we're dealing with fines, right?\n\n72\n00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.330\nIf we do not comply,\n\n73\n00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.860\nsome sort of legal punitive type of\npunishment is going to be placed upon us.\n\n74\n00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.170\nAnd again, typically, they like to\nhit you in the pocket book, right?\n\n75\n00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.920\nThat's what is going to make\nan organization stand up and\n\n76\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.135\ngo, I need to make sure we're doing this.\n\n77\n00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:41.405\n&gt;&gt; Or you might not even be able to\nhave that approval from that governing\n\n78\n00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:46.065\nagency or that entity, giving them their\nstamp of approval for that organization.\n\n79\n00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:48.445\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nif you can't get approved or certified,\n\n80\n00:03:48.445 --> 00:03:50.100\nwe're gonna talk about\nthat in a little while.\n\n81\n00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.910\nThen you might not be able to do business,\nor place a bid for future business,\n\n82\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.880\nbecause you don't have that\ncertification or that approval.\n\n83\n00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.990\nAll right, so\nthat's all about regulatory compliance,\n\n84\n00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.600\nnow let's talk about some of\nthe different frameworks that exist.\n\n85\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.205\nWe're not gonna go into details\non the different frameworks,\n\n86\n00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:08.090\nthey're all real similar,\nbecause when we talk about\n\n87\n00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.240\ncybersecurity frameworks they all\nreally have the same end goal in mind.\n\n88\n00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.780\nSo you're gonna have to as an organization\ndecide which ones are better for\n\n89\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.230\nyour particular company.\n\n90\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.250\nYou might look at other competitors in the\nthe same industry, see what they're using,\n\n91\n00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.860\ntalk to other people.\n\n92\n00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.580\nOne of the cool things\nabout security is that it\n\n93\n00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.210\ndoes typically bring people\ntogether in an industry.\n\n94\n00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.010\nWhereas you know even though\nwe're competitors in the field\n\n95\n00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.440\nwe still want to make sure that\nwe have the most information.\n\n96\n00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.680\nAnd like I was at a conference out there,\nan RSA conference, and\n\n97\n00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.766\nwas listening to a gentlemen talk, it was\nthe Four Seasons hotel one of their CIO's.\n\n98\n00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:50.930\nAnd he was saying every month they get,\nit's like eight or\n\n99\n00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.800\nnine of them they get together\nfrom competing hotel chains.\n\n100\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.850\nThese are worldwide global hotel chains.\n\n101\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.580\nThey all get together once a month for\na little round table\n\n102\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.840\nto talk about threats that they've faced,\nwhat they've done, what they're trying to\n\n103\n00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.850\ndo to prevent certain risks,\nnew technologies and things like that.\n\n104\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.950\nSo, even though they're competitors\nin the hotel market space,\n\n105\n00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.450\nthey work together when it\ncomes to cyber security.\n\n106\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.100\nBecause they understand that\nwhat affects one business\n\n107\n00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.520\ncould just as easily affect\ntheir business, right?\n\n108\n00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.760\nAnd that's what we see with the hackers\nnowadays is they're becoming specialized.\n\n109\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.560\nThat if I go after healthcare industry,\nthat's my focus.\n\n110\n00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.400\nI know how they work, how they store\ntheir data, what their weaknesses are.\n\n111\n00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.640\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; And I stick with that.\n\n112\n00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.030\nYeah, so\nyou see people doing that kind of thing.\n\n113\n00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.160\nSo it does seem to bring people together.\n\n114\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.930\nAnd today's a great time because we're\nstarting to see how we need to share\n\n115\n00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.530\nthat cyber threat and\ncyber attack information.\n\n116\n00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.810\nWhich we've talked about\na couple of those frameworks.\n\n117\n00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.220\nTAXII and STIX and\nsome others that help us set the language.\n\n118\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.870\nSo that we can share\ninformation with other people,\n\n119\n00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.800\neven though we're competitors,\n\n120\n00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.700\nwe can all talk the same jargon and still\nkeep information private where necessary.\n\n121\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.160\nAlright so anyway, I jump back,\nI digress back to frameworks.\n\n122\n00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.545\nNIST is a big one,\nespecially here in the United States.\n\n123\n00:06:05.545 --> 00:06:08.199\nNIST has a cybersecurity\nframework that we can look at, so\n\n124\n00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.678\nlet's take a look at my screen.\n\n125\n00:06:09.678 --> 00:06:11.460\nI'm just gonna show you\na couple of the web pages, and\n\n126\n00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.750\nif you want more information,\nthis is where you'd go to get those.\n\n127\n00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.061\nI'll make sure we put some links,\nmaybe in the show notes page.\n\n128\n00:06:18.061 --> 00:06:21.866\nBut NIST, our National Institute for\nStandards Technologies,\n\n129\n00:06:21.866 --> 00:06:26.867\ncybersecurity framework, they've got a PDF\nthere that you can go and take a look at.\n\n130\n00:06:26.867 --> 00:06:33.280\nAnd they're super exciting reads,\nlet me tell you, just kidding.\n\n131\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.050\nAnd I do like the one thing\nI wanna show on here,\n\n132\n00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.320\nit's just the fact that it kinda has\nan intro that talks about the framework.\n\n133\n00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.560\nLet's see if I can find one here,\nframework focuses on\n\n134\n00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.040\nusing business drivers to guide cyber\nsecurity activities and considering cyber\n\n135\n00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.800\nsecurity risks as part of the\norganization's risk management process.\n\n136\n00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.992\nSo really when we look at these\nframeworks, and they're all about,\n\n137\n00:06:55.992 --> 00:06:58.700\nlike I said, they all kinda\nhave the same end goal in mind.\n\n138\n00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.550\nAnd it's to tie our business needs as\nan organization with our security needs.\n\n139\n00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.267\nTo make sure that our security needs and\n\n140\n00:07:06.267 --> 00:07:08.669\nour compliance falls in line\nwith our business needs.\n\n141\n00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.307\nAnd they're not competing with each other\ncuz that is one thing that we tend to see\n\n142\n00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:16.120\nsometimes in an organization that's\nnot using any particular framework.\n\n143\n00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.820\nSometimes the security methods start\ngetting in the way of business processes.\n\n144\n00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.340\nWe've often mentioned the CIA triad,\nconfidentiality, integrity, and\n\n145\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.580\navailability.\n\n146\n00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.400\nAvailability's a big part of it and\nwe can-\n\n147\n00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.307\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes your end goals can\n\n148\n00:07:29.307 --> 00:07:33.610\nconflict if you're trying to\nappease all of those aspects there.\n\n149\n00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.400\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\n\n150\n00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.460\nif data's not available,\nthen it doesn't do me any good, all right?\n\n151\n00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.570\nIf I can't get to it as\nan end user to do my job,\n\n152\n00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.100\nbut I can't get to the customer's\ninformation while I've got them on\n\n153\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.610\nthe phone because of some security\nmeasure that's been put in place.\n\n154\n00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.306\nNow our security is hampering\nour business processes and\n\n155\n00:07:48.306 --> 00:07:49.943\nit's never gonna be a good thing.\n\n156\n00:07:49.943 --> 00:07:52.327\n&gt;&gt; This is probably, I'm not sure,\nyou can't quote me on this, but\n\n157\n00:07:52.327 --> 00:07:55.099\nit's probably one of the oldest frameworks\nbecause they've been around for\n\n158\n00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:55.925\nover a hundred years.\n\n159\n00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:57.371\nThey used to be called the.\n\n160\n00:07:57.371 --> 00:07:59.638\nWas the National Bureau of Statistics, and\n\n161\n00:07:59.638 --> 00:08:03.374\nthey kind of had to really start at\nthe beginning, start from scratch but\n\n162\n00:08:03.374 --> 00:08:06.820\nall this information is publicly\navailable at this point in time.\n\n163\n00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.711\n&gt;&gt; It is a great organization that\ngo out and get information from,\n\n164\n00:08:10.711 --> 00:08:15.553\nbecause they are who writes the frameworks\nand policies for the US government.\n\n165\n00:08:15.553 --> 00:08:21.530\nAnd so that they're, well, [LAUGH]\nthey're on top of security, aren't they?\n\n166\n00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.310\nWe never get anything bad happening there.\n\n167\n00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.890\nBut again, they've got the resources\nto develop this information.\n\n168\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.020\nThey've got the experience,\n\n169\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.230\nthey've got the information from all\nthe different businesses, so it is.\n\n170\n00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.310\nAnd then they make it available,\nbecause they understand that again,\n\n171\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:39.360\nwhen it comes to security, we're not\ngoing to secure our systems and, just,\n\n172\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.840\nyou know, good luck for you.\n\n173\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.320\nHope you can secure yours.\n\n174\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.750\nIt's in their best interests to make\nsure that businesses have what they\n\n175\n00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.180\nneed to become secure and\nstay secure as well.\n\n176\n00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.092\nGreat place to go.\n\n177\n00:08:51.092 --> 00:08:55.115\n&gt;&gt; Kind of interesting, I think,\nIndia had just released a free\n\n178\n00:08:55.115 --> 00:08:58.335\nanti malware piece of software for\ntheir country.\n\n179\n00:08:58.335 --> 00:09:01.045\nAnd I wonder if we'll see other\ncountries will start to follow that.\n\n180\n00:09:01.045 --> 00:09:01.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Nice, yes.\n\n181\n00:09:01.895 --> 00:09:03.415\nIt wouldn't surprise me.\n\n182\n00:09:03.415 --> 00:09:07.370\nIt's one of the things that It is kind\nof silly that I have to pay to protect\n\n183\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.330\nmyself, right?\n\n184\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.620\nBut, you start.\n\n185\n00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.001\n&gt;&gt; You pay taxes.\n\n186\n00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:15.072\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; For your civil workers.\n\n187\n00:09:15.072 --> 00:09:16.695\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; So maybe it's kind of something we'll\n\n188\n00:09:16.695 --> 00:09:18.420\nsee coupled into that in the future,\nI don't know.\n\n189\n00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, until Semantic and\nthe other big guys go, wait a second.\n\n190\n00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.505\nYou can't start giving away the product-\n&gt;&gt; Monopolize that, yeah.\n\n191\n00:09:23.505 --> 00:09:25.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That we make our living on.\n\n192\n00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.500\nSo it might be a tough sell.\n\n193\n00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.500\nBut typically you get what you pay for.\n\n194\n00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.580\nI'm sure, support and things like that.\n\n195\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.430\nSo NIST, a good one to go to.\n\n196\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.680\nISO, let me jump over\nto their web page here,\n\n197\n00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.120\nInternational Organization for\nStandardization.\n\n198\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.390\nWith that acronym that doesn't\ngo with their name type thing.\n\n199\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:45.902\n&gt;&gt; ISO.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n200\n00:09:45.902 --> 00:09:46.415\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n201\n00:09:46.415 --> 00:09:48.787\n&gt;&gt; It always make me chuckle.\n\n202\n00:09:48.787 --> 00:09:51.310\nBut anyway, they have lots and\n\n203\n00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:56.080\nlots of standards, many of which\ndeal with Information security.\n\n204\n00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.950\nThey've got their 27,000 series and\nthere are several.\n\n205\n00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.220\nIt's not just one or two.\n\n206\n00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.160\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of people I think\nkind of get stuck into the mindset\n\n207\n00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.390\nbecause I used to work for\na manufacturing company and\n\n208\n00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:12.860\nISO is a very large governing body that\nis used with the manufacturing industry.\n\n209\n00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.380\nBut we can use ISO services and\nbe compliant.\n\n210\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.470\nWe can be ISO compliant for\nservices as well.\n\n211\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.690\nIt's not just a product or\nsomething that you're manufacturing.\n\n212\n00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.630\nYou kind of understand that\nthere are thousands of different\n\n213\n00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.480\ncompliancees out there.\n\n214\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.010\n&gt;&gt; There are, and\n\n215\n00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.370\nfinding the ones you need to look\nat sometimes can be challenging.\n\n216\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.790\nAnd they release different ones,\nlike if we look at my web page here,\n\n217\n00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:40.240\nwe can kind of see off to the side,\nISO IEC 27,001.\n\n218\n00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.444\n2013 was their last version and\nthen their 2700,\n\n219\n00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:48.484\n2016 right now the overview and\nvocabulary is out.\n\n220\n00:10:48.484 --> 00:10:52.178\nWhich means that they'll be following\nthat up with the release of the actual\n\n221\n00:10:52.178 --> 00:10:53.920\nframework, shortly, I'm sure.\n\n222\n00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.190\nAs you can see, there are more than\na dozen standards in the 2700 family.\n\n223\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.940\nSo you can go there.\n\n224\n00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.020\nThe thing about ISO, these are not free.\n\n225\n00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.320\nYou can't just go and\ndownload these and read through them.\n\n226\n00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.390\nYou can typically get a preview of them,\n\n227\n00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.420\nor a short synopsis, and then you have\nto pay, to actually obtain the ISO.\n\n228\n00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.780\n&gt;&gt; So, Mike, if I have to pay for them and\n\n229\n00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.400\nthey're difficult to obtain\nwhat would be the benefit?\n\n230\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.310\nWhy would my company\nwant to be ISO certified?\n\n231\n00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.821\n&gt;&gt; Because maybe the field you're in you\nmight not be able to perform your service\n\n232\n00:11:21.821 --> 00:11:24.904\nif you're not certified or\npeople won't choose you if you're not or\n\n233\n00:11:24.904 --> 00:11:27.371\nyou just want to make sure\nthat you're in compliance.\n\n234\n00:11:27.371 --> 00:11:28.024\nThey set for\n\n235\n00:11:28.024 --> 00:11:32.343\nthese people know what they're doing\nwhen it comes to writing the standards.\n\n236\n00:11:32.343 --> 00:11:36.872\nAnd it's like you're getting all of this\nexperience dumped down into a little\n\n237\n00:11:36.872 --> 00:11:38.890\ndocument that I can follow.\n\n238\n00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.300\nHopefully use those guidelines\nto help secure my organization.\n\n239\n00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.850\nIt saves me a ton of time in research,\nand effort, and trial, and\n\n240\n00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.780\nmistakes when you have\na framework like this to use.\n\n241\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.772\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n242\n00:11:51.772 --> 00:11:56.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you get ISO we've\ngot COBIT, the control objectives for\n\n243\n00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.230\ninformation and related technologies.\n\n244\n00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.749\nThey just came out with a new one COBIT 5.\n\n245\n00:12:01.749 --> 00:12:03.145\nIt was recently released.\n\n246\n00:12:03.145 --> 00:12:06.239\nI can't remember the date but it was\nnot that long ago I think this year or\n\n247\n00:12:06.239 --> 00:12:07.930\nmaybe the end of last year.\n\n248\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.690\nBut it's put on by ISACA, they're the ones\nthat created the COBIT information\n\n249\n00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:17.980\nsystem's audit and\ncontrol association, all right?\n\n250\n00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.790\nAgain, same kind of thing.\n\n251\n00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.580\nLeading framework for the governance and\nmanagement of enterprise IT.\n\n252\n00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.010\nLet's click on the link here,\ngo to COBIT Online Right, and\n\n253\n00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.590\nyou'll see it's again same little\nsales clause there, sales pitch.\n\n254\n00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:34.060\nAnd let's see,\nif we go to information security,\n\n255\n00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.310\nI don't think they're going to let me see,\nyeah, gain temporary access to COBIT.\n\n256\n00:12:39.345 --> 00:12:39.845\nBut I'm not going to.\n\n257\n00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:42.955\nIf you guys want to, again, go out and\ndo a little bit of research.\n\n258\n00:12:42.955 --> 00:12:47.395\nWe've done some work in some\nother episodes with ISACA.\n\n259\n00:12:47.395 --> 00:12:49.835\nIf you think this is a standard\nyou might be interested in,\n\n260\n00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:52.845\njust go out and you can sign up for that.\n\n261\n00:12:52.845 --> 00:12:54.025\nWhat else?\n\n262\n00:12:54.025 --> 00:12:58.740\nSABSA, the Sherwood Applied Business\nSecurity Architecture is another one.\n\n263\n00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.370\nI'll just quickly show you\nsome of these web pages here.\n\n264\n00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.323\nTheirs, if I'm not mistaken is also pay.\n\n265\n00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:12.820\nSee if I can find the, yeah and\nthey do training as well.\n\n266\n00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.340\nTOGAF is another one.\n\n267\n00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.840\nTOGAF was\nThe Open Group Architecture Framework.\n\n268\n00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.100\nWhen I was looking at it,\nI was like, what does it stand for?\n\n269\n00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.625\nIt is The Open Group.\n\n270\n00:13:23.625 --> 00:13:25.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I was like, that makes sense.\n\n271\n00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.650\n&gt;&gt; These anagrams are killing me here.\n\n272\n00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.690\nNow Mike, are we going to need to know\nthese acronyms or how much do we know for\n\n273\n00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.920\nthis particular exam when\nit comes to these binds?\n\n274\n00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.590\n&gt;&gt; I would say be familiar\nwith the standards.\n\n275\n00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.220\nThe fact that they exist.\n\n276\n00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.780\nI doubt they would test\nyou on the acronym itself.\n\n277\n00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:43.080\nLike TOGAFB,\nthe open group architecture or\n\n278\n00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.560\nis it TOGAF toes only go against the flow.\n\n279\n00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.350\nThey're not going to test\nyou on acronyms like that.\n\n280\n00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:55.050\nBut understanding that those are standards\nand if they gave you some random string of\n\n281\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:14:00.150\nletters and one of them is TOGAF you\nshould say, that's the framework there.\n\n282\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.630\nBut you'll see the again, if we take\na look at, I'll zoom in a little bit here.\n\n283\n00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.210\nThat's a little too much,\neven my eyes can see that.\n\n284\n00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.130\nProven enterprise architecture\nmethodology and framework,\n\n285\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:15.210\nused improved business efficiency,\nwhat else?\n\n286\n00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.490\nEnsuring consistent standards,\nmethods and communication.\n\n287\n00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:22.570\nSo again it's just a set of frameworks\nthat we can use within our organization\n\n288\n00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:29.455\nto have consistency, impart security\ninto our information security.\n\n289\n00:14:29.455 --> 00:14:33.375\n&gt;&gt; So what about ITIL, that be considered\none of these frameworks as well because\n\n290\n00:14:33.375 --> 00:14:35.015\nit's a library of information?\n\n291\n00:14:35.015 --> 00:14:41.285\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's in fact one of the most\nwell known, maybe outside of NIST.\n\n292\n00:14:41.285 --> 00:14:45.010\nThey'll say on their website, that it\nis the most widely accepted approach\n\n293\n00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.850\nto IT servers management in the world.\n\n294\n00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.860\nIt's been around for a long time.\n\n295\n00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.640\nYou can actually get certified\nin ITIL in this framework.\n\n296\n00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.220\nWe can click on the link\nthere to find out about ITIL.\n\n297\n00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:00.036\n&gt;&gt; And we also have shows\non ITIL here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n298\n00:15:00.036 --> 00:15:01.888\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well plugged, right?\n\n299\n00:15:01.888 --> 00:15:06.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Love it, but there's a little video.\n\n300\n00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.010\nEverything you need to know\nabout ITIL in a 100 seconds.\n\n301\n00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.100\nI encourage you to watch\nthat video as well.\n\n302\n00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:17.100\nAgain, when we look, ITIL advocates that\nIT services are aligned to the needs\n\n303\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.520\nto the business and\nsupport its core processes.\n\n304\n00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.780\nFor writing guidance to organizations and\nindividuals and\n\n305\n00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:26.850\nhow to use IT as a tool, to facilitate\nbusiness change transformation and growth.\n\n306\n00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.740\nSo again, we're seeing it over and\n\n307\n00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.810\nover, all of these frameworks\nthat we're mentioning here\n\n308\n00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.740\nare really about making sure our IT and\nbusiness needs are aligned.\n\n309\n00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.400\nHow can we accomplish\nthat in our organization?\n\n310\n00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.386\nSo those are the ones that call out\nspecifically on the exam objectives,\n\n311\n00:15:44.386 --> 00:15:46.606\nthose particular frameworks.\n\n312\n00:15:46.606 --> 00:15:49.426\n&gt;&gt; So Mike when we're looking to\nthese frameworks for guidance,\n\n313\n00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:52.471\nwhat are some topics that we might\nyou looking for assistance with?\n\n314\n00:15:52.471 --> 00:15:57.783\n&gt;&gt; They're really, they're going to\ntalk about how we store information.\n\n315\n00:15:57.783 --> 00:16:00.070\nHow we maintain the information.\n\n316\n00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.050\nChange procedures are typically\na big part of it.\n\n317\n00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.830\nJust overall administration of IT-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n318\n00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.100\n&gt;&gt; is really what it comes down to.\n\n319\n00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.110\nAll right, next thing we want\nto talk about are policies.\n\n320\n00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.920\nAnd policies are another\nbig part in IT security.\n\n321\n00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.320\nI'm sure you've heard us talk about\nthem in several other shows, but\n\n322\n00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:27.290\npolicies are a way that we can\nformalize our business practices, or\n\n323\n00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:33.480\nwhat we deem as the way certain activities\nor procedures should be carried out.\n\n324\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.530\nSo policies are a way to\nkind of put that in writing.\n\n325\n00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.800\nAnd it's not like an organization has\none policy, we typically have several,\n\n326\n00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:49.310\ndozens, and a lot of these are actually,\nI say read.\n\n327\n00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.180\nThey're like,\nwhen you get hired by an organization,\n\n328\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:56.290\nyou've got to sign that you've read and\naccept these policies.\n\n329\n00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.160\nOff the top of your head, Cherokee,\n\n330\n00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.490\nwhat's a policy you think you\nmight find in a workplace?\n\n331\n00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.590\nCorporate security policy.\n\n332\n00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.970\n&gt;&gt; Corporate security policy, right?\n\n333\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:07.060\nThere's a great one except that we'll\nuse policies, password policies.\n\n334\n00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.600\nLet's take a look if you-\n&gt;&gt; Network access policies.\n\n335\n00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.990\n&gt;&gt; Network access policies, right?\n\n336\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.770\nDesktop use policies.\n\n337\n00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.130\nAll of those kind of things and\n\n338\n00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.760\neach one of them really tells\nyou what it's about it.\n\n339\n00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.060\nLike a password policy.\n\n340\n00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.150\n&gt;&gt; Pretty self explanatory.\n\n341\n00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what do you think\nwe're going to find in there?\n\n342\n00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.500\nInformation about how\nto store your pencils.\n\n343\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.300\nWhat is the password policy?\n\n344\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.520\nHow often do you have to change it,\nhow long it has to be,\n\n345\n00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.610\nhow strong it has to be, things like that.\n\n346\n00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.450\nPolicies typically have a couple of\ndifferent types of parts to them,\n\n347\n00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.380\nthey're going to have an overview,\n\n348\n00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:47.470\na high level bit of information\nabout the policy itself.\n\n349\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:48.970\nThen they'll have a purpose,\n\n350\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.670\nstating exclusively what\nthe purpose of this policy is.\n\n351\n00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.860\nThen they'll have some other\nparts inside there as well.\n\n352\n00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.880\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, we might not see all of\nthese policies in every environment.\n\n353\n00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.240\nThey really could be tailored\nto our specific industry.\n\n354\n00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.340\nFor the financial industry, or\nlike you mentioned earlier,\n\n355\n00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.880\nmaybe in the medical industry.\n\n356\n00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.820\nHow many years do you have to maintain\nthat patient's medical records?\n\n357\n00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.210\nAnd so we look at things like\nour data retention policy.\n\n358\n00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.340\nAnd there are others that might just be\na little specific for your industries.\n\n359\n00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n360\n00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.740\nAnd along with the overview and\n\n361\n00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.610\nthe purpose, you can also have\nguidelines or standards and\n\n362\n00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:30.290\nbest practices in there, telling somebody\nthey have to use a strong password\n\n363\n00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:33.990\nis not the same as teaching\nthem how to create one.\n\n364\n00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.020\nI have to have the word strong\nsomewhere in my password?\n\n365\n00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.420\nOkay, that's easy to follow.\n\n366\n00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.330\nThat's not exactly what we mean so-\n&gt;&gt; Biceps, one, two, three.\n\n367\n00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.960\n&gt;&gt; That would be a very strong password.\n\n369\n00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.775\nWell, not in my case.\n\n370\n00:18:45.775 --> 00:18:51.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, the policies are there to\n\n371\n00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.160\nagain, make sure that everybody is\non the same page and understand it.\n\n372\n00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:02.730\nAlso, the old saying about how you can't,\nwell, I don't know\n\n373\n00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:08.211\nif it's an old saying, but-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n374\n00:19:08.211 --> 00:19:09.628\n&gt;&gt; It's really hard to,\n\n375\n00:19:09.628 --> 00:19:11.670\nwhat's a good word I'm trying to use?\n\n376\n00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:17.250\nReprimand, or have a punishment against\nsomebody if they were unaware, right?\n\n377\n00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.260\nIt's really easy for people to say-\n&gt;&gt; You take that argument away,\n\n378\n00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.710\nbecause you just, here.\n\n379\n00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.980\nLook, this is what you saw, and\nyou don't have to have that argument then.\n\n380\n00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I mean they can't\nsay that's not my signature.\n\n381\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.700\nI guess they could try, but\nit's not going to help them.\n\n382\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.940\nAnd so that is a way that I can say look,\nyou were aware of these.\n\n383\n00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.550\nIf you didn't read it or understand\nit you should have asked questions.\n\n384\n00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.900\nIf you didn't read it that was your fault,\nyou signed it.\n\n385\n00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.630\nAnd that's why these go in our employee\njackets, so that in the future.\n\n386\n00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:48.140\n&gt;&gt; When we are surfing some forbidden\nsite from our company work computer and\n\n387\n00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:54.480\nit gets infected, they have a means\nto go against or to reprimand us.\n\n388\n00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.080\nI know reprimand is really\nnot the right word.\n\n389\n00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.120\nBut, and\na lot of times those will be listed,\n\n390\n00:19:59.120 --> 00:19:59.720\n&gt;&gt; You can't refute it.\n\n391\n00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.510\nIf it's your signature, for the most\npart you're going to have a pretty good\n\n392\n00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.721\nback story if you try to refute your\nsignature on a signed document.\n\n393\n00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:06.798\n&gt;&gt;

Absolutely, and then now speaking of so\n\n400\n00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.536\nokay they told that we\nneed a password policy.\n\n401\n00:20:29.536 --> 00:20:32.870\nWe don't have a formal one,\nit hasn't been formalized yet.\n\n402\n00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.520\nIt's just been word of mouth, hey,\n\n403\n00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.390\nmake sure you use a good\nstrong password Cherokee.\n\n404\n00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.710\nBut know we want to formalize it.\n\n405\n00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.010\nWe're getting to be a large organization,\n\n406\n00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.450\nwe need to have a way to make sure\neverybody's informed of this.\n\n407\n00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.070\nAnd I don't want issues with compliance,\nor\n\n408\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.660\nfines because somebody said they didn't\nknow and they were violating policy.\n\n409\n00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.910\nSo what do we do?\n\n410\n00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.870\nWhat if you were asked to write\nan acceptable use policy?\n\n411\n00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.240\nWhere do you start, right?\n\n412\n00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.680\nI'll show you where you start,\nyou start at SANS.\n\n413\n00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.230\nLet's take a look at my site here,\nor my computer here.\n\n414\n00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.940\nI'm on SANS, I've gone through the ins\nof their policies in their reading room.\n\n415\n00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.900\nThey have their Information\nSecurity Policies Template, again,\n\n416\n00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.600\nfreely available.\n\n417\n00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.050\nIf we could zoom in just a, man.\n\n418\n00:21:13.788 --> 00:21:17.000\nI'm going to get used to the scroll\nin this one in just a minute.\n\n419\n00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.980\nGeneral network security, sever security,\napplication security, old and\n\n420\n00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.280\nretired so if we take a look\nat say network security, we\n\n421\n00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.090\nare going to see remote access policies,\nwireless communications policies.\n\n422\n00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:34.410\nIf we go up to general what were\nwe asking about password policies.\n\n423\n00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.390\nTypically use policy,\nlet's take a look at that one.\n\n424\n00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.280\n&gt;&gt; And even before you get\nto this particular website,\n\n425\n00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.510\nif you're not even sure who should be in\ncharge of that particular component and\n\n426\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:48.210\nthis even outlines, they really break\nit down into extreme categories like\n\n427\n00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:52.180\ndifferent classes and families to say\nif it's management or it's technical so\n\n428\n00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:56.620\nyou can then,\nI guess delegate these duties accordingly?\n\n429\n00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:57.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n430\n00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.650\nSo lots of great sources for information.\n\n431\n00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:03.560\nAnd you can see this is just a template\nwhere it's got company name, right.\n\n432\n00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.640\nSo you're going to go in and\nreplace your organization's name there.\n\n433\n00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.715\n&gt;&gt;

Good advice.\n\n439\n00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.460\n&gt;&gt; But you can see the overview,\nas I was saying, the purpose.\n\n440\n00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.950\nThe scope, I forgot that part,\nthat is in most,\n\n441\n00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.410\nalmost all policies should\nhave a scope as well.\n\n442\n00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:36.800\nThose three parts overview purpose\nscope are in just about every policy.\n\n443\n00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.380\nScope is, who they supplies to, right?\n\n444\n00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.060\nThis might be a password policy only for\nupper management.\n\n445\n00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.560\nAnd so\nthe scope would inform me of that so\n\n446\n00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.430\nas an end user, I don't have to\ncomply with this particular policy.\n\n447\n00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:49.859\nAnd then the policy itself.\n\n448\n00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:55.830\nAnd this is where you're going to go in\nand see if these apply, make changes, add,\n\n449\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.010\nremove, unacceptable use.\n\n450\n00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.720\nAnd again, I'm just, I know you can't\nread this, I'm scrolling really fast.\n\n451\n00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.640\nAnd this test is not on what's\nin SANS policy templates.\n\n452\n00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.110\nJust wanted to give you an idea of\nall the different components and\n\n453\n00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.570\npieces that are in a policy.\n\n454\n00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.067\nI do like the fact that they have,\n\n455\n00:23:14.067 --> 00:23:17.010\nwe're going to go back up\nhere just a little bit.\n\n456\n00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.520\nYou'll see in their policy they\nhave unacceptable use, right?\n\n457\n00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.430\nThis is an acceptable use policy.\n\n458\n00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.395\nBut they've got unacceptable use in here.\n\n459\n00:23:25.395 --> 00:23:27.270\nBecause not only are they\ntelling you what is acceptable,\n\n460\n00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.820\nbut they're going to call out certain\nscenarios that are unacceptable.\n\n461\n00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.790\nUnder no circumstances is\nthis going to to be allowed.\n\n462\n00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.700\nSo, I like that kind of thing.\n\n463\n00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.320\n&gt;&gt; I like how their angle.\n\n464\n00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.652\nYeah.\nBecause also even when\n\n465\n00:23:36.652 --> 00:23:41.002\nyou're talking about scope, sometimes it's\nimportant to not just define what you will\n\n466\n00:23:41.002 --> 00:23:44.197\nbe covering be also what you will\nnot be covering just to clarify.\n\n467\n00:23:44.197 --> 00:23:44.775\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n468\n00:23:44.775 --> 00:23:46.238\nYou get that scope creep.\n\n469\n00:23:46.238 --> 00:23:48.826\nWe talk about a little project management.\n\n470\n00:23:48.826 --> 00:23:53.127\n&gt;&gt;

It does, absolutely.\n\n493\n00:24:47.702 --> 00:24:52.441\nAnd then you're never gonna get full\nsupport and compliance in that case.\n\n494\n00:24:52.441 --> 00:24:55.473\nAnd then terminology is also\nan important part of most policies\n\n495\n00:24:55.473 --> 00:24:58.111\nbecause in the policy you might,\nyou gotta remember.\n\n496\n00:24:58.111 --> 00:25:00.240\nOops, I don't know what I just clicked on.\n\n497\n00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.501\nBut you might use terms that\nare specific or IT related.\n\n498\n00:25:05.501 --> 00:25:09.231\nRemember, these policies are gonna be\nread by people other than IT within your\n\n499\n00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:10.030\norganization.\n\n500\n00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:14.457\nYou really should just stay\naway from many of those terms.\n\n501\n00:25:14.457 --> 00:25:18.761\nUsing acronyms and things like that\nin a policy is typically a no go,\n\n502\n00:25:18.761 --> 00:25:23.100\nagain, because of the wide audience\nthat the policy is gonna have.\n\n503\n00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.966\nBut if you do have to\nuse some of those terms,\n\n504\n00:25:24.966 --> 00:25:26.590\nmake sure you put a glossary in there.\n\n505\n00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.695\nThat will help make sure everybody's\non the same page, again, and\n\n506\n00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:32.540\nnot able to say, well,\nI didn't even know what that meant.\n\n507\n00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.979\nSo I just ignored that part.\n\n508\n00:25:33.979 --> 00:25:34.823\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or something like that.\n\n509\n00:25:34.823 --> 00:25:37.091\n&gt;&gt; But usually you would have someone.\n\n510\n00:25:37.091 --> 00:25:41.817\nIf you're really concerned with that,\nlike with the HR person, going through and\n\n511\n00:25:41.817 --> 00:25:46.060\nthey're supposed to be explaining these,\nif you do have any questions.\n\n512\n00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.880\nAnd give the person\nan opportunity before they sign.\n\n513\n00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.700\n&gt;&gt;

And it's a really good\npoint that you bring up, Mike,\n\n524\n00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.092\nbecause I've seen people for\ncompanies sign non-compete.\n\n525\n00:26:24.092 --> 00:26:25.578\nAnd then if they left that company,\n\n526\n00:26:25.578 --> 00:26:28.120\nthey would have a hard time\ntrying to find a new job.\n\n527\n00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.042\nI actually worked for a company and\n\n528\n00:26:31.042 --> 00:26:36.197\none of their policies was,\nit was for, whats the word here?\n\n529\n00:26:36.197 --> 00:26:39.373\nIntellectual property,\nand so if I had an idea,\n\n530\n00:26:39.373 --> 00:26:45.830\nsix months there after the termination,\nregardless of who ended that relationship.\n\n531\n00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.904\nIt was the company's idea, so I couldn't\neven think for an entire six months.\n\n532\n00:26:48.904 --> 00:26:50.687\n&gt;&gt; Six months after-\n&gt;&gt; Six months after, yeah.\n\n533\n00:26:50.687 --> 00:26:54.232\n&gt;&gt; Your employment, they still owned your\nintellectual property, that's interesting.\n\n534\n00:26:54.232 --> 00:26:55.939\nI guess if it's signed and\n\n535\n00:26:55.939 --> 00:27:01.229\nin their contract it would be interesting\nto see how that would play out in court.\n\n536\n00:27:01.229 --> 00:27:03.790\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Not that you would wanna be the one to\n\n537\n00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.200\ntry it out but.\n\n538\n00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.040\nBut to say we own your intellectual\nproperty or any ideas you come up with\n\n539\n00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.250\nthe next six months,\neven though you don't work for us anymore.\n\n540\n00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:14.511\nBut you do, you see that kind of thing a\nlot where people work for universities or\n\n541\n00:27:14.511 --> 00:27:16.745\nbusinesses and they come up with an idea.\n\n542\n00:27:16.745 --> 00:27:20.191\nThey leave the university, they were doing\nresearch, they leave the university,\n\n543\n00:27:20.191 --> 00:27:21.460\nstart making money with that.\n\n544\n00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.587\nAnd then the university comes back and\nsays, wait a second.\n\n545\n00:27:23.587 --> 00:27:27.115\nYou were a student here or\nan employee here when that occurred,\n\n546\n00:27:27.115 --> 00:27:30.660\ntherefore all of that is actually\nproperty of the university.\n\n547\n00:27:31.922 --> 00:27:35.000\nAll right, so frameworks,\npolicies, a couple checked off.\n\n548\n00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.043\nI know Cherokee's giving me that eye.\n\n549\n00:27:36.043 --> 00:27:37.680\nIt looks like we're\njust about out of time.\n\n550\n00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.180\nWe do have a little more to go, but\n\n551\n00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.050\nprobably more than we can squeeze\nin the next minute or so.\n\n552\n00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:43.550\n&gt;&gt; We won't try to squeeze it, Mike.\n\n553\n00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.114\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ngive us some time here.\n\n554\n00:27:46.114 --> 00:27:48.181\nI think we've got a good head start so\nfar, but\n\n555\n00:27:48.181 --> 00:27:50.200\nwe do have more information\nheaded your way.\n\n556\n00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.238\nSo don't go anywhere, stay comfortable.\n\n557\n00:27:52.238 --> 00:27:54.020\nFor this show,\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n558\n00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.770\nAs your show host, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n559\n00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:56.560\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.425\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.795\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:12.342\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:16.540\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Cyber Security Analyst + series.\n\n7\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.740\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.750\nIf you've been following along you'll know\nthis is actually a part two where we were\n\n9\n00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.090\nanalysing different frameworks,\nsecurity policies and controls.\n\n10\n00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.180\nWith us today we have Mr Mike Rodrick\nin studios, thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.280\njoining us today Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.558\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome thanks for having\nme back excited to be here as always.\n\n13\n00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:39.640\nAnd yes, we left off talking about, or\ngetting ready to talk about controls.\n\n14\n00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.550\nWe've talked about frameworks and\n\n15\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.970\nhow these are our documents that give\nus the framework to reuse the term.\n\n16\n00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.950\nThe set of guides that we can use\nto make sure that our IT solutions\n\n17\n00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.020\nare in align with our business needs,\nthat they don't start conflicting.\n\n18\n00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.190\nBest practices,\nI don't wanna say best practices, but\n\n19\n00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.030\nthese are frameworks that\nhave been developed over\n\n20\n00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.271\ntime that we can use to implement in\nour own organizationally specific way.\n\n21\n00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:10.800\nBut if we follow those frameworks\nwe know we're on the right track.\n\n22\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.507\nWe talked also about policies and\nhow policies are ways to formalize what\n\n23\n00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:19.030\nwe expect as an organization.\n\n24\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.132\nThings like password policies or\nacceptable use policies.\n\n25\n00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:25.365\nIn fact I did wanna go back and\nmention I know we talked about them kind\n\n26\n00:01:25.365 --> 00:01:27.973\nof in general,\nI showed a couple of places you can go and\n\n27\n00:01:27.973 --> 00:01:30.630\nto get some templates if you\nneeded to write policies.\n\n28\n00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.690\nI do wanna mention the ones\nthey specifically call out\n\n29\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.540\non the exam objectives, just to make sure.\n\n30\n00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.090\nIf you're gonna do any research, go look\nat these and what you might find in them.\n\n31\n00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.690\nAnd as we were kinda joking earlier,\nthey're pretty self explanatory for\n\n32\n00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.190\nthe title.\n\n33\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.980\nBut password policies, right,\ndealing with our passwords.\n\n34\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.020\nHow long they have to be,\nhow often we have to change them.\n\n35\n00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.160\nIf you're in management you\nhave to change it more often,\n\n36\n00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.660\nit has to be longer, things like that.\n\n37\n00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.600\nWe've got our acceptable use policy so\nthat I can't go and\n\n38\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.697\nuse the printer to print off\ninvitations to my Cinco de Mayo party.\n\n39\n00:02:02.697 --> 00:02:03.562\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You got me.\n\n40\n00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:04.354\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n41\n00:02:04.354 --> 00:02:07.195\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who's using all the colored ink?\n\n42\n00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:09.417\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I mean, what's\nan invitation without colors, right?\n\n43\n00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:11.940\nSo acceptable use.\n\n44\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.860\nI can't be at work and doing any kind\nof auction sniping on my eBay stuff.\n\n45\n00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.987\nData ownership policies,\nwhen you create a document,\n\n46\n00:02:21.987 --> 00:02:24.390\nwho's the listed owner of that document?\n\n47\n00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.154\nDid that get transferred to\na kind of a generic account or\n\n48\n00:02:28.154 --> 00:02:31.790\ndoes the individual user\nmaintain ownership?\n\n49\n00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.000\nData retention,\nI think you mentioned that one, Cherokee.\n\n50\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.840\nHow long, depending on what the documents\nare, what organization I'm in,\n\n51\n00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.960\nwhat industry I'm in,\nhow long I have to keep documents for.\n\n52\n00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.040\nThat includes documents,\nbackups, things like that.\n\n53\n00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.790\nAccount management policy,\nhow do we deal with accounts?\n\n54\n00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.110\nWho creates them?\n\n55\n00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.280\nCan anybody create an account, or does\nit have to be a procedure to go through?\n\n56\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.620\nAlso, the flip side of things.\n\n57\n00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.610\nWhat about when somebody\nleaves the organization?\n\n58\n00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.710\nWhat happens to that account?\n\n59\n00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.700\nIs there a procedure that\nwe go through to make sure?\n\n60\n00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.380\nI know I've dealt with an organization\n\n61\n00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.020\nthat had some issues with that where\nthe account was created for this person.\n\n62\n00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.870\nIt's tied to several other accounts and\ncustom software that they use.\n\n63\n00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.710\nAnd while they've disabled\nthe Active Directory account,\n\n64\n00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.760\nthat didn't disable the accounts\nin some of this custom software.\n\n65\n00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.940\nAnd that account was still available\nif somebody had wanted to use it,\n\n66\n00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.490\nthings like that.\n\n67\n00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.868\nHow do we go about dealing with accounts?\n\n68\n00:03:30.868 --> 00:03:34.360\n&gt;&gt; Especially if you're partnering\nwith any kind of contractor or\n\n69\n00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.020\nany kind of short term business partner.\n\n70\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.903\nYou have to think about that\non-boarding and that off-boarding.\n\n71\n00:03:38.903 --> 00:03:42.480\nAnd who actually has access to what\nparts of your network and what data.\n\n72\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.332\nSo, definitely something to consider.\n\n73\n00:03:44.332 --> 00:03:48.890\n&gt;&gt; I think we mentioned in a previous\nepisode, we had talked about.\n\n74\n00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.050\nI forget the healthcare company now but\n\n75\n00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.454\nwe were talking about the five big hacks\nthat have occurred in the last few years.\n\n76\n00:03:52.454 --> 00:03:57.228\nAnd remember one of the reasons they\ngot that $5.5 million dollar fine was\n\n77\n00:03:57.228 --> 00:04:00.533\nbecause there was an account\nfrom an employee that was\n\n78\n00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:03.985\nno longer with the organization\nwas still being used for\n\n79\n00:04:03.985 --> 00:04:08.340\na year after the employee had left\nto access all kinds of information.\n\n80\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.917\nAnd that information was turned around and\nbeing sold or given out, so.\n\n81\n00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:16.619\nData classification polices,\nanother big important part of how we deal\n\n82\n00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:21.930\nwith our data especially nowadays because\nnot all data is treated the same.\n\n83\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.930\nHow long do we keep it is determined\nby what type of data it is,\n\n84\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.380\nhow well it's protected,\nwho has access to it.\n\n85\n00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.190\nSo data classification\nhas to be done as well.\n\n86\n00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.750\nBut anyway those are some of the policies\nthat they specifically call out\n\n87\n00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.760\non the exam objectives.\n\n88\n00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.510\nAlright, now controls.\n\n89\n00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.110\nSo if policies are ways that we\nformalize our business plans and\n\n90\n00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.210\nhow we want things to work and\nhow we want things done,\n\n91\n00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.500\ncontrols are kind of\nthe way we enforce that.\n\n92\n00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.860\nOr the way we can monitor for\ncompliance with those policies.\n\n93\n00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.480\nSo when we look at\ncontrols there's different\n\n94\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.080\ntypes of controls we can deal with.\n\n95\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.199\nWe've got physical controls,\n\n96\n00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.890\nwe have technical controls\nand/or logical controls.\n\n97\n00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.750\nOr technical/logical,\nthey're typically interchangeable there.\n\n98\n00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.110\nBut physical, technical/logical,\nand then, administrative controls.\n\n99\n00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.270\nAnd your physical controls.\n\n100\n00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.570\nI like the way, the physical\nbarriers deployed to prevent direct\n\n101\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.600\ncontact with systems, or\nportions of a facility, right?\n\n102\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.889\nSo, when we look at physical controls,\n\n103\n00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.535\nwe're talking about things like fences,\nbarricades,\n\n104\n00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:40.390\nlocked doors, man traps,\nthese are all physical things.\n\n105\n00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.095\nLights, floodlighting around\nentranceways and things like that,\n\n106\n00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:48.350\nthese would be considered\nphysical controls.\n\n107\n00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.770\nI've got a spreadsheet, I guess we can\npull this up while I'm talking about this.\n\n108\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.210\n&gt;&gt; And Mike, all of these different\ncontrols, it's not that one style,\n\n109\n00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.420\ntechnical, administrative, physical,\nis more important than the other.\n\n110\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.770\nYou really should have a good mix,\n\n111\n00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.760\nbecause if you focus all of your\nefforts in one particular area,\n\n112\n00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.992\nthen you're kind of leaving a gaping\nhole there, for those attackers.\n\n113\n00:06:08.992 --> 00:06:09.778\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n114\n00:06:09.778 --> 00:06:14.037\nyou've gotta have kind of all of these\nin place typically in most scenarios.\n\n115\n00:06:14.037 --> 00:06:18.705\nAnd again, the physical,\ntechnical/logical, administrative,\n\n116\n00:06:18.705 --> 00:06:22.670\nsometimes those lines blur\na little bit between controls.\n\n117\n00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.210\nI mean some of them are very obvious,\n\n118\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.790\nlike a barbed wire fence is\ndefinitely a physical control.\n\n119\n00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.110\nThe other thing that we gotta think about\ntoo is within those categories, they can\n\n120\n00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:39.520\nbe preventative, detective, corrective,\na deterrent, and recovery, right?\n\n121\n00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.770\nPreventative aims to prevent something,\nsomething before it happens.\n\n122\n00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.560\nAnd that's where you're gonna see like\nsecurity officers, biometric scanners.\n\n123\n00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.990\nIf we talk physical preventive locks,\nright?\n\n124\n00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.870\nIf that door is locked,\n\n125\n00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.810\nthat's physically preventing me from\nbeing able to enter that facility.\n\n126\n00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.870\nDetective Is going to not prevent,\nbut notice that something's happening.\n\n127\n00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.540\nRight, this would be a camera,\nor motion sensored lights.\n\n128\n00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.415\nThey're not gonna prevent me.\n\n129\n00:07:10.415 --> 00:07:13.896\nAnd that front door's lit\nup like a football stadium,\n\n130\n00:07:13.896 --> 00:07:16.780\nit's not gonna prevent\nme from breaking in.\n\n131\n00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.840\nBut it is gonna make sure\nthat anybody walks by,\n\n132\n00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.220\nthey're gonna see me breaking in, right?\n\n133\n00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.280\nSo it's a detective measure.\n\n134\n00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.120\nCorrective, don't have a lot of\nphysical corrective controls.\n\n135\n00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.250\nDeterrents, though, again fences would\nbe considered a deterrent as well as\n\n136\n00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.095\na preventative, redundant facilities.\n\n137\n00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:43.260\nRecovery-wise, a redundant facility,\nsorry if I said that earlier.\n\n138\n00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.546\nRedundant facilities would be part of a\nrecovery, a physical control for recovery.\n\n139\n00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:51.770\nIf this place gets burned to the ground,\nor is unavailable for some reason,\n\n140\n00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.862\nwe've got another facility located\nin a different town, or miles away,\n\n141\n00:07:55.862 --> 00:07:58.700\nthat everybody can go to and\nwe can limp along and And\n\n142\n00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.386\nbegin the process of doing our disaster\nrecovery, and our business continuity plan\n\n143\n00:08:03.386 --> 00:08:06.900\nis going to say this is where you\nneed to report to in a disaster.\n\n144\n00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.860\nWe can kind of limp along and get our\nbusiness back up and running, right,\n\n145\n00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.010\nthen you've got your logical controls,\ncan be hardware, these can be software.\n\n146\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.040\nI say logical, again,\nthis list calls it technical,\n\n147\n00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.640\nthis is actually one I borrowed from our\nCISSP class cuz it's the same thing.\n\n148\n00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.200\nI know Comptia I think likes to call them\nlogical, so keep that in mind if you're\n\n149\n00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.280\nlooking at this technical / logical,\nkind of the same thing.\n\n150\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:38.550\nBut hardware, software,\nmanage access to resources,\n\n151\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.640\nprovide protection for\nthose resources and systems.\n\n152\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.240\nSo here, and I'll zoom in just a little\nbit, I know that I didn't write this\n\n153\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.780\nspreadsheet, it's a really interesting\ncolor choice after the fill color here.\n\n154\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.770\nThings like access control list,\n\n155\n00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.830\ncryptography hashes,\nright these are logical or\n\n156\n00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:01.220\ntechnical controls they can help me\nprotect my systems and my information.\n\n157\n00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.570\nRight if we encrypt something that's\npreventative because I'm going to\n\n158\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.260\nprevent you from accessing this\ndata because it's encrypted.\n\n159\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.740\nIf you don't have the appropriate key,\nthen you're not authorized and\n\n160\n00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.630\nyou're not allowed to\nsee that information.\n\n161\n00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.580\nWe're preventing you from accessing it,\nsmart cars, right.\n\n162\n00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.980\nIf we're using those to protect doorways,\nin host based\n\n163\n00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.420\nintrusion prevention systems, network\nbased intrusion protection systems,\n\n164\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:31.370\nthese will be considered logical or\ntechnical controls.\n\n165\n00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.190\nThose would fall under,\nif we look here those would be under\n\n166\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:41.530\ndetective when we look at logs and\nIPS and IDS, because again,\n\n167\n00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:46.490\nkinda like the lights,\nthey're going to show me what's happened.\n\n168\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.450\nBut it's already happened at this point,\nwhen you read about something in a log\n\n169\n00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:55.570\nfile, it's already happened, so it's not\npreventative, it's going to be detective.\n\n170\n00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.130\nCorrective might be a system image,\nthis would be a logical control.\n\n171\n00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.260\nI wanna put a control in place that says,\nif our systems get compromised,\n\n172\n00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.680\nwe can be back up and running in an hour.\n\n173\n00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.720\nThat might be what my policy says,\nhow do I implement that,\n\n174\n00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.390\nhow do I make sure that that can happen?\n\n175\n00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.210\nWe take system images,\nthat's that control I'm gonna choose for\n\n176\n00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:19.430\nthat particular scenario and that way,\nif something happens in that system\n\n177\n00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.480\nI can restore it from that system image, I\ncan be back up and running within an hour.\n\n178\n00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.710\nRight, or whatever the timeframe happens\nto be, so that'd be a corrective.\n\n179\n00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:34.620\nThen you've got data backups could\nalso be considered recover, as well.\n\n180\n00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.430\nThat's why I say some of these times\nthese lines blur a little bit, so\n\n181\n00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.800\nthose are logical controls.\n\n182\n00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.420\nAdministrative controls, policies and\n\n183\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.400\nprocedures as defined\nby your organization.\n\n184\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.990\nAll right, so these are one, some of the\npolicies that we've already talked about\n\n185\n00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.140\ncould be considered\nadministrative controls.\n\n186\n00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.540\nWe've put those in place,\n\n187\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.200\nbut also we would include things\nlike separation of duties, right?\n\n188\n00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.880\nMaking sure that one person didn't\nhave the entire set of keys necessary,\n\n189\n00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.370\nthey might know this part,\nbut not this part, right?\n\n190\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.720\nWe separate out those duties.\n\n191\n00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.280\nClassification systems would be\nan administrative type of control\n\n192\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.530\nbecause they way I can classify data and\nI can say, look,\n\n193\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.440\nonly if you have top level clearance,\nyou get access to this otherwise,\n\n194\n00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.900\nbecause you don't get access\nonly to public information.\n\n195\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.680\nEmployee training would be a preventative\nadministrative control, right?\n\n196\n00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.000\nHe's got that listed as detective,\nthat would not be.\n\n197\n00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.926\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was gonna ask,\nI also heard management.\n\n198\n00:11:29.926 --> 00:11:31.280\n&gt;&gt; No, I read that set wrong.\n\n199\n00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.900\nWhat's that?\n&gt;&gt; Like management control,\n\n200\n00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.000\nsometimes someone might consider these or\ncall them management.\n\n201\n00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.757\nI guess it just depends on\nwho you're speaking too.\n\n202\n00:11:37.757 --> 00:11:40.687\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, that's a very\ngood point, and management controls,\n\n203\n00:11:40.687 --> 00:11:42.200\nadministrative controls.\n\n204\n00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.260\nTraining would be preventative,\n\n205\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.570\nI thought we had goofed up on our\nspreadsheet, but there you go.\n\n206\n00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.540\nBecause if I can train you, right?\n\n207\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.500\nI'm gonna hopefully prevent any\ntype of issues from occurring,\n\n208\n00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.920\nincidents from occurring, job rotation,\ninvestigations, monitoring, all of\n\n209\n00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.310\nthese would be considered administrative\nor managerial type controls.\n\n210\n00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.620\nSo which ones do we put in place?\n\n211\n00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.450\nWell again, that's gonna depend on you and\nyour organization.\n\n212\n00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:12.110\nYou're gonna have to go and\ndecide How much money we have to spend,\n\n213\n00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.190\nwhich controls are best for our scenario,\n\n214\n00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:20.410\nthere are documents out there that you\ncan use to help you select your controls.\n\n215\n00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.017\nShoot, I used to have that bookmarked,\nlet me see if I can find it.\n\n216\n00:12:27.418 --> 00:12:29.530\nI'll do a quick search\nhere while we're talking.\n\n217\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.820\nBut there are documents that you can go\nout there again from places like NIST and\n\n218\n00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.240\nSANS that will have criteria\nthat you're looking for or\n\n219\n00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.400\nsolutions that you're trying to find.\n\n220\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.890\nIt'll help you and guide you to\nthe right controls to put in place.\n\n221\n00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.540\n&gt;&gt; And this is really a difficult\nposition for one individual.\n\n222\n00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.770\nUsually your see security teams working\ntogether so you can get multiple eyes and\n\n223\n00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:48.800\ndifferent angles.\n\n224\n00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.490\nBecause it's really hard for one person\nto come up with all these possible\n\n225\n00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.790\nwhat if scenarios and\nthen try to work in that way.\n\n226\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.530\nSo working together as a team,\n\n227\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.340\nusually you're gonna be working with\nindividuals from different departments.\n\n228\n00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.870\nBecause from Mike and I's perspective or\n\n229\n00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.370\nsomeone in the IT department, they may\nunderstand this server is important to me.\n\n230\n00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.940\nBut from another department they may\ngive some really great input that\n\n231\n00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.360\nyou really weren't aware of or\neven knew existed, different things, so\n\n232\n00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.080\njust keep that in mind as well.\n\n233\n00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know what?\nI don't know what I did with that,\n\n234\n00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.390\nlet me go find it real quick,\nI know I've got it up on the Cloud.\n\n235\n00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:28.032\nIt's always there, so give me just one\nsecond we dive into here, COMPTIA.\n\n236\n00:13:28.032 --> 00:13:30.778\n&gt;&gt; Did you happen to see\nany of the cloud bleed\n\n237\n00:13:30.778 --> 00:13:33.870\neffects on any of your accounts Mike?\n\n238\n00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:39.220\n&gt;&gt; No no, luckily not,\nsorry I have trouble talking and\n\n239\n00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.332\ntyping at the same time.\n\n240\n00:13:40.332 --> 00:13:43.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No multi tasking.\n\n241\n00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.510\n&gt;&gt; There it is I found it,\nlet's see if I can get it to open now.\n\n242\n00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.180\nAll right, so this is just one example,\nthis is the Center for\n\n243\n00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.590\nInternet Security Critical\nSecurity Controls version six.\n\n244\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:58.660\nAnd it's, again, not the easiest\nread here, and it's very small, and\n\n245\n00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.460\ndon't worry about reading it from here.\n\n246\n00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.080\nBut again, the point is there are\ndocuments out there that you can find from\n\n247\n00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.890\nthese different organizations.\n\n248\n00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.110\nThey can help guide you and talk about\nwhat controls do you need to put in place\n\n249\n00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.600\ndepending on what it is\nyou're trying to accomplish.\n\n250\n00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool\n&gt;&gt; All right, but\n\n251\n00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.820\nI guess absolutely, all right,\nprocedures, so I think we'll do next.\n\n252\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.890\nAnd when we're talking about procedures,\ncontinuous monitoring\n\n253\n00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:27.610\nis one of the first ones they talk\nabout here in our sort of objectives.\n\n254\n00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.980\nInformation security continuous\nmonitoring is a term you might see or\n\n255\n00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.520\nmore often you'll see the acronym ISCM.\n\n256\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.660\nThis is becoming a big thing,\nit's not that its just now becoming but\n\n257\n00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.650\nwe're seeing it gather\nmomentum in organizations.\n\n258\n00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:48.010\nBecause for the longest time we\nweren't doing continuous monitoring,\n\n259\n00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.180\nright, we got that yearly audit.\n\n260\n00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.270\nAnd about a month or two or so\nbefore the audit everybody starts\n\n261\n00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.910\nyou know getting into panic mode and\ngoing through their check list.\n\n262\n00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:01.220\nAnd then trying to figure out what was\nthat we needed fixed from the last\n\n263\n00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.100\nauditor.\n\n264\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.527\nAll the things that have changed and\nthey get in that mode, and so\n\n265\n00:15:05.527 --> 00:15:09.411\nyou spend a month or so just really\ncranking down and trying to get ready.\n\n266\n00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:11.678\nYou spend a lot of time,\na lot of resources,\n\n267\n00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:15.667\nthese are employees that are no longer\nbeing productive because now they're\n\n268\n00:15:15.667 --> 00:15:18.977\nfocused on making sure we pass\nthis audit that's coming up, and\n\n269\n00:15:18.977 --> 00:15:22.388\nthat's if you have the fortune\nto know when the audit's coming.\n\n270\n00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:23.391\nSometimes [INAUDIBLE]\n\n271\n00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:24.127\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Are\n\n272\n00:15:24.127 --> 00:15:24.984\nnot-\n&gt;&gt; Surprise!\n\n273\n00:15:24.984 --> 00:15:29.240\n&gt;&gt; Announced, yes, or hey,\nwe're gonna be there one month from now.\n\n274\n00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:29.795\nAnd tomorrow?\n\n275\n00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:30.705\n[SOUND] Hey,\n\n276\n00:15:30.705 --> 00:15:34.549\nwe decided we'd show up early,\njust to get you off your toes, right?\n\n277\n00:15:34.549 --> 00:15:37.290\nOr catch you sleeping there.\n\n278\n00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.520\nSo continuous monitoring is something\nthat we're seeing more and more of.\n\n279\n00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.494\nNow, understand when I say continuous\nmonitoring I don't mean 24/7 nonstop\n\n280\n00:15:46.494 --> 00:15:49.170\nmonitoring, although, that can be done.\n\n281\n00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.836\n&gt;&gt; Maybe like a follow through,\n\n282\n00:15:50.836 --> 00:15:55.313\njust someone in charge with the reins\nsaying, hey, are we following through?\n\n283\n00:15:55.313 --> 00:15:57.028\nHow are you doing on this?\n\n284\n00:15:57.028 --> 00:16:00.365\nI don't want to be the person to nag,\nbut kind of, right?\n\n285\n00:16:00.365 --> 00:16:01.677\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n286\n00:16:01.677 --> 00:16:02.880\nWe set schedules up.\n\n287\n00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.145\nWe look at what we need to monitor and\n\n288\n00:16:05.145 --> 00:16:09.602\nwe decide how often we should be\nmonitoring this stuff because again,\n\n289\n00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:14.222\nif I'm looking at log files once a month\nis it really gonna do me any good?\n\n290\n00:16:14.222 --> 00:16:15.850\nYes, it will help me find things.\n\n291\n00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.680\nThere's no question about that.\n\n292\n00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.037\nBut finding things that\noccurred 20 days ago.\n\n293\n00:16:20.037 --> 00:16:24.591\nNow this bad guy's been in my system for\nthree weeks and\n\n294\n00:16:24.591 --> 00:16:30.036\nhad I been monitoring these a little\nmore regularly, I might have\n\n295\n00:16:30.036 --> 00:16:36.677\nbeen able to prevent some of that data\nexfiltration that was going on all right?\n\n296\n00:16:36.677 --> 00:16:38.309\nNot doing 24/7, but\n\n297\n00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:43.330\njust determining what the best schedule\nis to do some of this monitoring.\n\n298\n00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.003\nSome stuff you might monitor a lot\nmore often than other stuff.\n\n299\n00:16:47.003 --> 00:16:50.102\nAnd I'll show you an example\nhere in a second.\n\n300\n00:16:50.102 --> 00:16:54.604\nI was reading an interesting article from\none of the governmental bodies here in\n\n301\n00:16:54.604 --> 00:16:55.274\nthe US, and\n\n302\n00:16:55.274 --> 00:16:59.660\nthey were talking about how regulatory\ncompliance is extremely expensive.\n\n303\n00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.490\nThey were talking about\nthat the billions of\n\n304\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.241\ndollars that they spend every year\ntrying to maintain FISMA compliance.\n\n305\n00:17:07.241 --> 00:17:11.836\nAnd that almost a million of that goes\ninto audits, and having people come in and\n\n306\n00:17:11.836 --> 00:17:14.727\ncheck to make sure that\nthey are being compliant.\n\n307\n00:17:14.727 --> 00:17:18.769\nSo that when a real audit comes in,\nthey're good to go.\n\n308\n00:17:18.769 --> 00:17:23.207\nAnd they said that they had,\nonce they implemented\n\n309\n00:17:23.207 --> 00:17:29.020\ncontinuous monitoring 90%\nimprovement in risk posture.\n\n310\n00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:29.630\n&gt;&gt; I could see that.\n\n311\n00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.420\nIt's a lot easier to maintain something\nthan to go back and try to fix it all.\n\n312\n00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, right?\n\n313\n00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:39.080\nIf we're doing our patch\nmaintenance once a month, right?\n\n314\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.341\nIf there's a system that some how\ngot missed in that last update,\n\n315\n00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:47.290\ndidn't get patched it's 30\ndays before I realize that and\n\n316\n00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.480\nwe do our next look in our systems or\nbefore the next patch cycle.\n\n317\n00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.657\nAnd then we go wow this guy never\ngot the patch from last month, but\n\n318\n00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:59.102\nif I'm monitoring a little\nmore often once a week now all\n\n319\n00:17:59.102 --> 00:18:01.611\nover sudden I will see that a lot sooner.\n\n320\n00:18:01.611 --> 00:18:03.850\nWhich is going to reduce my overall risk,\nright?\n\n321\n00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:08.240\nI'm not at risk, because I have\napplied my patches properly.\n\n322\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.584\nAll right, let me see if I can find, I\nknow I'm a little unorganized here today.\n\n323\n00:18:11.584 --> 00:18:16.370\nLet's take a look at,\nhere we go, SANS again.\n\n324\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.190\nBack to SANS, one of my favorite places.\n\n325\n00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.655\nThey've got a document, and NIST,\nof course, has a document as well, and\n\n326\n00:18:21.655 --> 00:18:22.530\nthere are others.\n\n327\n00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.270\nBut this is continuous monitoring.\n\n328\n00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.650\nWhat it is, why it is needed,\nand how to use it, all right?\n\n329\n00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.090\nGreat document if you need some more\ninformation, great way to study for this.\n\n330\n00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:36.280\nBut I wanted to show you\nsomething about halfway down here.\n\n331\n00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.864\nYou can see they pulled this information.\n\n332\n00:18:38.864 --> 00:18:40.360\nFrom [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So Mike,\n\n333\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.750\nare we gonna put these links in\nthe show notes for people to view or?\n\n334\n00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:49.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll definitely upload all of the\nactually PDFs, or at least make a list.\n\n335\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.561\nIt would probably be easier just\nto give you a list to the links.\n\n336\n00:18:52.561 --> 00:18:55.714\nI'll dump all the PDFs that I've\nspecifically downloaded and showed.\n\n337\n00:18:55.714 --> 00:18:57.295\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n&gt;&gt; I'll put them up with the show notes\n\n338\n00:18:57.295 --> 00:18:58.100\nand then links.\n\n339\n00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.202\nJust keep in mind that links get dates.\n\n340\n00:19:00.202 --> 00:19:03.289\nPeople move things and that's beyond\nour control we don't go back and\n\n341\n00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:04.240\nupdate those links.\n\n342\n00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.665\nSo if you click on a link for\nSANS document on continuous monitoring and\n\n343\n00:19:08.665 --> 00:19:10.165\nit says page not found,\n\n344\n00:19:10.165 --> 00:19:15.120\nbreak out your favorite search engine\ntype it in SANS continuous monitoring.\n\n345\n00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:16.870\nDon't panic.\n\n346\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.621\nIt just means that they've moved it and\nthe link is out of date.\n\n347\n00:19:20.621 --> 00:19:24.371\nBut this is a little chart and you can\nsee they actually pulled it from this and\n\n348\n00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:26.670\nif I can't get that darn\nlittle bar to go away.\n\n349\n00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:32.620\nFrom the NIST special publication 800-92,\nwhich I actually have opened over here,\n\n350\n00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.870\nbut easy enough to show you from this one.\n\n351\n00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.640\nYeah, this is talking about categories,\nlow impact systems,\n\n352\n00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.000\nmoderate impact and high impact systems.\n\n353\n00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.610\nHow often should I retain log data?\n\n354\n00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.520\nFor low impact, maybe one to two weeks.\n\n355\n00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.403\nIf it's moderate, one to three months.\n\n356\n00:19:47.403 --> 00:19:50.894\nHigh impact systems, we keep those\nlogs around for up to 12 months,\n\n357\n00:19:50.894 --> 00:19:53.080\ndepending on your specific needs.\n\n358\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.870\nHow often do we rotate logs?\n\n359\n00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:59.117\nHow often does log data need to be\nanalyzed locally through automatic or\n\n360\n00:19:59.117 --> 00:20:00.210\nmanual means?\n\n361\n00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.520\nLow impact system?\n\n362\n00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.210\nOne to seven days.\n\n363\n00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.679\nAt least once a week, if you're\ngoing through the logs [CROSSTALK]\n\n364\n00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:06.160\n&gt;&gt; Great information, yeah.\n\n365\n00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.755\nAnd like you had said, in looking at that\nSpecial Publication 800, that SP 800,\n\n366\n00:20:09.755 --> 00:20:12.961\nthat one is really gonna be focused on\na lot of these topics that you're talking\n\n367\n00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:14.388\nabout right here, the security.\n\n368\n00:20:14.388 --> 00:20:15.941\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n369\n00:20:15.941 --> 00:20:19.680\nAnd I like this one, at least six\ntimes a day on high impact systems.\n\n370\n00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.186\nHow many of you out there right\nnow can raise your hand and\n\n371\n00:20:22.186 --> 00:20:24.172\nsay that you check your\nlogs six times a day?\n\n372\n00:20:24.172 --> 00:20:24.860\n&gt;&gt; Not I.\n\n373\n00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.578\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Me neither.\n\n374\n00:20:27.578 --> 00:20:30.180\nBut, you know, it's a high impact system.\n\n375\n00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.920\nWe look at the risk of that thing\nbecoming compromised in the impact.\n\n376\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.705\nYou look at the likelihood and\nthe impact, right?\n\n377\n00:20:35.705 --> 00:20:38.430\nWe do our risk assessment, and\n\n378\n00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:44.170\nIt pays in the end to have somebody, it\npays to pay somebody, if I can say that.\n\n379\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:48.780\n&gt;&gt; Or just someone delegate like we talked\nabout before in your IT department.\n\n380\n00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:52.863\nIf you can have a rotational schedule and\nthen create checklists and\n\n381\n00:20:52.863 --> 00:20:57.161\nhave people responsible for\nactually signing off on, all right Mike,\n\n382\n00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:59.827\ndid you check that log at,\nyou know at 9 AM.\n\n383\n00:20:59.827 --> 00:21:03.103\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it can be monitored,\nautomated, right?\n\n384\n00:21:03.103 --> 00:21:04.590\nI mean,\nthat is one of the things we can do.\n\n385\n00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.600\nWe've got our seam systems, we can crunch\nthose logs and filter them down and\n\n386\n00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.530\nlook for specific things.\n\n387\n00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:14.250\nSo it's not that I'm going to every\nmachine, six times a day maybe.\n\n388\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.052\nOr maybe I am, maybe that's\nthe system that we've developed.\n\n389\n00:21:17.052 --> 00:21:22.034\nIn fact, I've got the NIST,\nwhich one was it referring to, 92.\n\n390\n00:21:22.034 --> 00:21:26.354\nI thought I had 92, open up,\nI've got 137, opened up.\n\n391\n00:21:26.354 --> 00:21:27.442\n&gt;&gt; So what did the says?\n\n392\n00:21:27.442 --> 00:21:28.318\nWhat logs?\n\n393\n00:21:28.318 --> 00:21:29.158\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what logs?\n\n394\n00:21:29.158 --> 00:21:30.126\n[LAUGH] There you go.\n\n395\n00:21:30.126 --> 00:21:33.180\nThat's what I'm talking about.\n\n396\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:38.170\nIn fact, if I remember right,\nactually NIST SP892\n\n397\n00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:42.512\nhas been changed, it's SP800137.\n\n398\n00:21:42.512 --> 00:21:43.481\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n399\n00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:44.083\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is, you can\n\n400\n00:21:44.083 --> 00:21:44.669\nsee, continuous monitoring.\n\n401\n00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:45.639\nYeah, I know.\n\n402\n00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:47.631\nAll right, so same document, or\n\n403\n00:21:47.631 --> 00:21:51.626\nthis is the actually document that\nSANS was creating the paper on.\n\n404\n00:21:51.626 --> 00:21:56.123\nThey were filtering it down and\nmaking it a little more concise and\n\n405\n00:21:56.123 --> 00:21:57.689\nmore human readable.\n\n406\n00:21:57.689 --> 00:22:02.226\nNot that this one is human readable,\nbut just leave it at that.\n\n407\n00:22:02.226 --> 00:22:02.906\n&gt;&gt; Technical.\n\n408\n00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:04.624\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll leave it at that.\n\n409\n00:22:04.624 --> 00:22:11.007\nAnd when we talk about SANS, I know\nCherokee, you were talking about SANS,\n\n410\n00:22:11.007 --> 00:22:17.120\nif we go out and let's do, not SANS,\nbut NIST, if we do a NIST SP series.\n\n411\n00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:19.760\nSee if I can find that here.\n\n412\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.240\nLet's go out there and\ntake a look at their SPs.\n\n413\n00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.310\nAll right, you can see they've\nactually got a new set,\n\n414\n00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.479\nwhich I am actually excited to go read.\n\n415\n00:22:29.479 --> 00:22:30.109\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n416\n00:22:30.109 --> 00:22:31.555\nit makes me sound like a super geek.\n\n417\n00:22:31.555 --> 00:22:35.850\nBut they got the SP1800,\ncybersecurity best practices.\n\n418\n00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:37.420\nThese are a little more modern.\n\n419\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.382\nUpdated and not to mention replace the 800\nbut kind of compliment them and bring them\n\n420\n00:22:41.382 --> 00:22:44.216\nmore in line with today's [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like this certification.\n\n421\n00:22:44.216 --> 00:22:46.802\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly right.\n\n422\n00:22:46.802 --> 00:22:50.410\nSo I'm actually excited to go back and\nread some of those.\n\n423\n00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.830\nBut yeah, if we click on,\nlet's say click on SP800.\n\n424\n00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.950\nRight and\nIn fact I think it's the same page, yeah.\n\n425\n00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:56.913\nThere we go.\nI'm just going to start and\n\n426\n00:22:56.913 --> 00:22:58.638\nscroll at a moderate pace.\n\n427\n00:22:58.638 --> 00:23:00.467\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.\n\n428\n00:23:00.467 --> 00:23:02.437\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.\n\n429\n00:23:02.437 --> 00:23:05.750\nRight, all of these are part\nof the SP800 series.\n\n430\n00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.780\nThey're dash and\nthen a few more numbers there.\n\n431\n00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.830\nSo they can get very specific.\n\n432\n00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.757\nThe technical specifications for\n\n433\n00:23:12.757 --> 00:23:15.687\nthe Security Content Automation Protocol,\nSCAP.\n\n434\n00:23:15.687 --> 00:23:20.090\nBut if you use SCAP in your organization,\nbe a good document to read, right?\n\n435\n00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:24.391\nSo there's lots of information\navailable out there.\n\n436\n00:23:24.391 --> 00:23:26.805\nAnyway, back to continuous monitoring.\n\n437\n00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:31.855\nAs I was saying, I don't mean to\nimply it's 24-7 monitoring per se,\n\n438\n00:23:31.855 --> 00:23:34.550\nbut you're gonna develop a schedule.\n\n439\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:39.650\nAnd the idea is we need to do it more\noften than a month before the audit right?\n\n440\n00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:43.842\nBecause it's a lot less expensive and\na lot less effort if I find\n\n441\n00:23:43.842 --> 00:23:48.823\nout about things quickly and fix them\nas we go then to wait for 11 months and\n\n442\n00:23:48.823 --> 00:23:53.753\nthen now try to fix everything that is\ngoing to cause us to fail that audit.\n\n443\n00:23:53.753 --> 00:23:57.230\nIn that 30 days before that audit,\nso by staying on top of things,\n\n444\n00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.490\nyou're gonna make it easier\non your organization.\n\n445\n00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:04.560\nNot to mention making it a lot less\nstressful when it does come, audit time,\n\n446\n00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.940\nright, we got this in the bag.\n\n447\n00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.080\nWe've been preparing for\n\n448\n00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.740\nthis since the day you left from\nthe last year's audit, right?\n\n449\n00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.160\nAll right, so what else have we got here?\n\n450\n00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.130\nEvidence production is an interesting one.\n\n451\n00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.270\nAgain, this is what they\ncall it in the objectives,\n\n452\n00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.240\nthey don't mean we're gonna\nproduce evidence right?\n\n453\n00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.900\nWe're not making evidence up,\n\n454\n00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:29.160\nthat would be illegal and it wouldn't\nhold up in court and we might go to jail.\n\n455\n00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.490\nBut we're talking about\ncollection of evidence,\n\n456\n00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:33.900\ngetting that information together.\n\n457\n00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.620\nWe've hinted on that a little bit or\n\n458\n00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:39.090\nwe've talked about that in our other\nepisodes, so we'll go by that one.\n\n459\n00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:43.670\nPatching, patching is an extremely\nimportant part of maintaining our systems,\n\n460\n00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.410\nand we have to have patch\nmanagement in place.\n\n461\n00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.620\nAnd you'll never guess what both SANS and\nNIST have.\n\n462\n00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:57.420\nYeah, they have papers that we can go\nout and read on patch management, right.\n\n463\n00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.530\nWe've got to apply patch management,\nremember,\n\n464\n00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:05.490\nthe thing about patches is they're\nfixing problems typically.\n\n465\n00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:09.010\nSometimes they introduce new functionality\nwhich introduces new problems, but for\n\n466\n00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.980\nthe most part a lot of these patches\nare fixing known vulnerabilities or\n\n467\n00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:18.060\nfundamental laws in an application or\nan operating system.\n\n468\n00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.920\nFirmware patches would be included here,\n\n469\n00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.900\nwhich can definitely update\ncapabilities of a device but\n\n470\n00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.810\nalso fix issues that were present in\nprevious versions of that firmware.\n\n471\n00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.516\nVery important that we get those done,\n\n472\n00:25:33.516 --> 00:25:38.439\nit's kinda like walking around\nwithout doing your vaccines, right?\n\n473\n00:25:38.439 --> 00:25:40.940\nAlthough that's probably hot topic,\nI should probably stay away from that\n\n474\n00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.710\nbecause I know some people\nmight not believe in that.\n\n475\n00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.970\nBut I always thought to myself if\nI'm going to take my computer, and\n\n476\n00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.760\nplug it to the network, and\nI don't want to apply these patches,\n\n477\n00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.590\nthat's like me going to a hospital\nwithout any of my immunization.\n\n478\n00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.200\nAnd then just walking through a pool of\ngerms, just like asking to be infected.\n\n479\n00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.850\nThe patches are out there, they're\navailable, apply them, and the interesting\n\n480\n00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:06.110\nthing about it is, at least in my opinion,\nwhen those patches come out\n\n481\n00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.910\nthey're great for us, because we can our\nsystems and we can protect ourselves.\n\n482\n00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:10.450\nBut they're also great for the bad guys.\n\n483\n00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.780\nYou might think, well why would\nthe patches be great for the bad guys?\n\n484\n00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.789\nBecause they can look at the patch,\nreverse engineer it,\n\n485\n00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:16.739\nit's not very difficult.\n\n486\n00:26:16.739 --> 00:26:18.690\n&gt;&gt; Sure they're always working at that.\n\n487\n00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and if I can figure\nout what the patch is fixing,\n\n488\n00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.630\nnow I know what the problem is with\nthe machines that were not patched, and\n\n489\n00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.000\nI've got a great vulnerability that\nI can write and exploit against.\n\n490\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.860\nAnd I've got all the technical details\nI need in the patch, most likely,\n\n491\n00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.691\nto write a really good exploit to\ntake advantage of that vulnerability.\n\n492\n00:26:34.691 --> 00:26:39.515\n&gt;&gt; Now these frameworks, they're providing\na good guidelines, but once you get\n\n493\n00:26:39.515 --> 00:26:44.870\ncomfortable in your methodology and say,\nI know Microsoft has Patch Tuesday.\n\n494\n00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.890\nWell, what happened last\nweek with Patch Tuesday?\n\n495\n00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.180\nThey skipped it and\nthey pushed it out a month ahead,\n\n496\n00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:54.240\nso not only like you said\nit's not a one and done deal.\n\n497\n00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.420\nYou have to monitor continuously,\nstay in the game, stay vigilant so\n\n498\n00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.080\nthat you can kind of evolve\nwhenever your environment's change.\n\n499\n00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.700\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nit's very important to stay on top,\n\n500\n00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.960\nwe've talked about getting\nstaying up to date.\n\n501\n00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.200\nAs a security professional, it's one\nof the biggest things that you've got\n\n502\n00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.710\nto do is stay current, because\nthings change so fast in this field.\n\n503\n00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:18.130\nSo getting yourself hooked up\nwith mailing lists, readers,\n\n504\n00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:22.330\nwhat have you from the different\nvendors that produce the patches.\n\n505\n00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.870\nFrom places like Bug Tracks Info Sec,\nand these are the places\n\n506\n00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.690\nthat make this information available,\npulling all that into one place.\n\n507\n00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.420\nLike I use an RSS reader, but\nthat pulls all these titles in.\n\n508\n00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.360\nIf there's one that peaks my interest,\nor applies to my organization,\n\n509\n00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.890\nI can pull it up and get more details.\n\n510\n00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.400\nAs for patching I think we all\nunderstand the importance of that,\n\n511\n00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:48.130\ncompensating controlled development,\ninteresting one there.\n\n512\n00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.340\nI’m going to define it for you,\nalternative security controls employed\n\n513\n00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.460\nby organizations in lieu\nof a specific control.\n\n514\n00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:03.617\nAlright, the idea is that we can provide\nequivalent Or comparable control.\n\n515\n00:28:03.617 --> 00:28:06.050\n&gt;&gt; Like an if-this-then-what kind of deal?\n\n516\n00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:06.620\n&gt;&gt; Kind of.\n\n517\n00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:11.930\nYes, like let's say we're used to\nkeeping our documents here in house,\n\n518\n00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:16.620\nand we know that they're safe because\nwe've got great physical security.\n\n519\n00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.460\nWe've got good access control, and\nwe can make sure that information is safe.\n\n520\n00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.940\nBut now we've decided to\nmove it out to the cloud,\n\n521\n00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.570\nI've lost the physical controls I have.\n\n522\n00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:30.170\nThe locks to the server closets that\nprevents anybody from going in there and\n\n523\n00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.920\ngrabbing those hard drives or\nphysically touching my servers.\n\n524\n00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.880\nI've lost that control,\n\n525\n00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.790\nI can't put that control in\nplace up in the cloud because I.\n\n526\n00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:43.040\nMy stuff is shared now with other people\nstuff it's not my server closet anymore\n\n527\n00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.810\nI have lost that control, so what do I do?\n\n528\n00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:51.698\nWell, maybe we now say look encryption\nis going go be our alternate control.\n\n529\n00:28:51.698 --> 00:28:57.107\n&gt;&gt; This is our compensation control,\nI'm gonna make up new words here.\n\n530\n00:28:57.107 --> 00:28:59.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is a way to compensate\n\n531\n00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.580\n&gt;&gt; For the lack of the physical security\n\n532\n00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.650\nthat we've got we're gonna encrypt things.\n\n533\n00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:06.610\nIt's in a sense gonna give us that same\nlevel of security cuz we don't have\n\n534\n00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:09.440\nthe physical control if somebody\naccesses the information though and\n\n535\n00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.100\nstole those hard drives\nfrom that service provider.\n\n536\n00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.500\nMy data's gonna be encrypted, so\n\n537\n00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.710\nthey're not gonna be able to\nget access to the information.\n\n538\n00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.830\nSo that's what they mean\nby a compensation control.\n\n539\n00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.740\nIt's when we use one control in lieu of or\nin replacement of\n\n540\n00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.240\nanother control when that original\ncontrol might be the best choice, but\n\n541\n00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.300\nis not available to us for\ntechnical reasons, for legal reasons.\n\n542\n00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.130\nFor some reason,\nI can't put that control in place,\n\n543\n00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:35.080\nwe'll find something else\nthat'll do almost as good.\n\n544\n00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n545\n00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.750\nWindows Control testing procedures,\nand we've gotta test our controls.\n\n546\n00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.540\nWe can't just go and\nput cameras out and go woohoo,\n\n547\n00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.380\nwe've got our physical controls out there,\nwe're good to go.\n\n548\n00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:50.240\nAnd then somebody breaks in, and you go\nto watch the tape, and you realize that\n\n549\n00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.790\nthe camera was pointed at the side of\nthe building, and the door is over here.\n\n550\n00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.510\nThat's not gonna do us any good, right?\n\n551\n00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:58.350\nAnd that's a silly little example,\n\n552\n00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:02.730\nbut it's just a way to prove a point\nthat you've got to test controls.\n\n553\n00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:06.040\nJust putting them in place doesn't\nmean they're gonna work and\n\n554\n00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.390\ndoesn't mean they're gonna do\nwhat you expect them to do.\n\n555\n00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:13.970\nSo you have to have a testing procedure,\nyou have to do this regularly.\n\n556\n00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:18.430\nWe have to adjust that camera could be\nknocked off course by wind, somebody.\n\n557\n00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.740\nBumps it, a bird, a big fat pigeon that\njust ate a whole loaf of bread lands on\n\n558\n00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.530\nit, and the camera droops a little bit.\n\n559\n00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:25.730\nAnd now it's pointed at the ground and\n\n560\n00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:29.508\nnot the door, so you catch the guy's\nshoes as he walks into your building.\n\n561\n00:30:29.508 --> 00:30:37.315\nYou gotta make sure we are testing,\nwhat else do I need to talk about there?\n\n562\n00:30:37.315 --> 00:30:42.672\nIt really helps us identify strengths and\nweaknesses in our information\n\n563\n00:30:42.672 --> 00:30:48.226\nsystems by doing the testing on those\ncontrols, managing expectations.\n\n564\n00:30:48.226 --> 00:30:48.950\n&gt;&gt; Exceptions?\n\n565\n00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:49.765\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, exceptions.\n[LAUGH]\n\n566\n00:30:49.765 --> 00:30:51.720\n&gt;&gt; Actually, I have a funny story.\n\n567\n00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.330\nLast night I was trying to shop.\n\n568\n00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.420\nYou guys,\nNike.com has 20% off from their clearance,\n\n569\n00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.660\nwhich is a pretty good deal and\nI'm an avid online shopper.\n\n570\n00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:03.230\n[LAUGH] So, I received an exception and\n\n571\n00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:08.020\nerror handle message last night and\nit was interesting cause,\n\n572\n00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.200\nI guess everyone was rushing to the sale,\nand brought down there servers,\n\n573\n00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.260\nbut they kind of, I forget the verbage but\nthey were playing on a game.\n\n574\n00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.390\nLike we're gonna get back\nin the game very soon, or\n\n575\n00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.660\nsomething kind of wordy like that, and I\nthink that's what they're going for here.\n\n576\n00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.820\nAnd I've seen different websites,\nDisney.com has a really great one too,\n\n577\n00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.820\nthey have Mr. Fix-it Felix Jr.\nwith the little photo.\n\n578\n00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.100\nI don't know if you've seen that,\nWreck-It Ralph?\n\n579\n00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.551\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes.\n\n580\n00:31:34.551 --> 00:31:38.903\nSo we're just trying to conceal\nany kind of information that may\n\n581\n00:31:38.903 --> 00:31:42.780\nleak because of that error,\na generic or default error.\n\n582\n00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.837\nAnd so,\nwhen you create those custom errors,\n\n583\n00:31:44.837 --> 00:31:47.492\nyou're really protecting your\norganization in that way.\n\n584\n00:31:47.492 --> 00:31:51.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, our chat room is making\n\n585\n00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:56.041\ninteresting jokes about pancake day and\nhow we crept up on that.\n\n586\n00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:57.321\nThat was a good one by the way.\n\n587\n00:31:57.321 --> 00:32:00.364\n&gt;&gt; I know, they're very witty today.\n\n588\n00:32:00.364 --> 00:32:02.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so managing exceptions.\n\n589\n00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.730\nThe thing is,\nwe can have all these policies.\n\n590\n00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:09.150\nWe can have all these\ncontrols in place but\n\n591\n00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.420\nvery seldom can we be 100% about anything.\n\n592\n00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:15.850\nSo we are gonna have exceptions and\nwe need to just manage this.\n\n593\n00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.210\nWe need to be aware of them,\n\n594\n00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:21.010\nwe need to make sure people are,\nunderstand why they're in placed.\n\n595\n00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.580\nYou might have legacy applications.\n\n596\n00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.720\nWe require all communications\nto be encrypted.\n\n597\n00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.550\nYet this legacy application just\ndoesn't understand encryption.\n\n598\n00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.657\n&gt;&gt; Legitimate exceptions.\n\n599\n00:32:30.657 --> 00:32:31.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n600\n00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.560\n&gt;&gt; Not like exception handling.\n\n601\n00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.310\nSorry, that was my mistake there.\n\n602\n00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:37.230\nI'm thinking about, that's also\nanother security implementation.\n\n603\n00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.310\n&gt;&gt; It is, yes,\nthat's why I let you go with it.\n\n604\n00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.550\nI mean, it fit right in there.\n\n605\n00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.522\nI liked it.\n\n606\n00:32:41.522 --> 00:32:44.024\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'll let you do your\n\n607\n00:32:44.024 --> 00:32:44.951\n[INAUDIBLE].\n\n608\n00:32:44.951 --> 00:32:45.780\nHow about that.\n\n609\n00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.254\n&gt;&gt; Applications that aren't active,\n\n610\n00:32:48.254 --> 00:32:52.300\ndependencies on third party\nlibraries is a big one.\n\n611\n00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.640\nWe do code review on everything.\n\n612\n00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.440\nBut if we've got a third party library and\n\n613\n00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:00.570\nthat is not open sourced,\nI can't get into that code library to see.\n\n614\n00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.780\nI might not be allowed to see\nthe source code for that.\n\n615\n00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:05.230\nThere's nothing I can do about tha.\n\n616\n00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:06.665\nEven though my policy says.\n\n617\n00:33:06.665 --> 00:33:08.670\nIt can't be helped.\n\n618\n00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:09.940\nSo there are gonna be exceptions.\n\n619\n00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.840\nIt's just important to know that\nas an organization we've outline\n\n620\n00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.900\nthose exceptions.\n\n621\n00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.070\nWe know where they are so\nthat when something creeps up.\n\n622\n00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:18.420\nWait, is that an exception.\n\n623\n00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.460\nNo, that's not an exception.\n\n624\n00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:23.950\nThat is a violation of our policy or yeah\nthat's an exception, we know about that.\n\n625\n00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:29.390\nThat's okay that that's not following\nalong with our guidelines and policies.\n\n626\n00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:32.150\nLast thing, I know you're giving me that\nevil eye there, we're running out of time.\n\n627\n00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:33.830\nA couple more things to talk about.\n\n628\n00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:37.000\nRemediation plans\nare gonna be one of them.\n\n629\n00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.510\nIt is important obviously\nto have a remediation plan.\n\n630\n00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:43.518\nRemediation, how do we\ngo about fixing things.\n\n631\n00:33:43.518 --> 00:33:48.630\nOnce we find out that we are out of\ncompliance with one of our policies,\n\n632\n00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.960\nwe need remediation.\n\n633\n00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.430\nWe find that-\n&gt;&gt; If you don't have a plan,\n\n634\n00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.500\nyou're setting yourself up for failure.\n\n635\n00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.672\nYes, that is a little like\na Pinterest quote, but that's okay.\n\n636\n00:33:58.672 --> 00:34:00.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like it.\n\n637\n00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:03.110\nIt is very true and\nvery applicable to this,\n\n638\n00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:07.810\nbut it is important that we have a way to,\nif something breaks.\n\n639\n00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.320\nI've always learned, if you're not part of\nthe solution, you're part of the problem.\n\n640\n00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.185\nAnd I don't know if that's\nas applicable as your was.\n\n641\n00:34:13.185 --> 00:34:14.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I thought I'd throw my\n\n642\n00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.070\nown saying in there.\n\n643\n00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.775\n&gt;&gt; Keep them coming.\n\n644\n00:34:16.775 --> 00:34:19.630\n[LAUGH] But seriously otherwise,\nit could fall by the wayside and\n\n645\n00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.710\nforget that that issue even happened.\n\n646\n00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:24.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's better to come\nup with these ahead of time.\n\n647\n00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:30.460\nOtherwise, once the issue is discovered,\nwe don't have a plan of action.\n\n648\n00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.710\nNow it's just gonna sit there while\nwe try to figure out what to do.\n\n649\n00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.440\nWhereas, if we have\na remediation plan in place,\n\n650\n00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.620\nit would facilitate a much quicker\nrecovery and fix of the issue.\n\n651\n00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.830\nAnd I'm not being specific on purpose.\n\n652\n00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:47.840\nIt's because this could be remediation\nfrom somebody violating a password policy\n\n653\n00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.470\nto somebody installing software\nthat wasn't on the allowed list to\n\n654\n00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:56.080\nsomebody using a system for something\nthat violates the acceptable use policy.\n\n655\n00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:56.910\n&gt;&gt; That was the purposes, yeah.\n\n656\n00:34:56.910 --> 00:35:00.465\nSo what are you gonna do to\nstop that from happening again.\n\n657\n00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:03.195\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and there's one thing I\nfound when I was doing some research on\n\n658\n00:35:03.195 --> 00:35:07.085\nremediation plans that I thought might\nfit in here, something known as smart.\n\n659\n00:35:08.335 --> 00:35:11.325\nIt's very debatable I guess,\nwho came up with this.\n\n660\n00:35:11.325 --> 00:35:14.959\nAnd I went that rabbit hole for a good\n15 minutes, a complete waste of my time.\n\n661\n00:35:14.959 --> 00:35:16.585\nBut I'll say George T.\n\n662\n00:35:16.585 --> 00:35:20.040\nI don't know if that's true or not but\n\n663\n00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:24.430\nthat's what most places site as the first\nperson that used this in writing, anyway.\n\n664\n00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:26.720\n&gt;&gt; Are we talking about the smart goals.\n\n665\n00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.718\n&gt;&gt; Not smart goals.\n\n666\n00:35:27.718 --> 00:35:28.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n667\n00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:30.380\nSmart goals.\n\n668\n00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.190\n&gt;&gt; Smart goals, yeah.\n\n669\n00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:37.740\nWhen it comes to remediation,\nwe want to have specific.\n\n670\n00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.320\nThe S is for specific.\n\n671\n00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.370\nI'll tell you what the term stands for,\nSpecific,\n\n672\n00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.510\nMeasurable, Assignable,\nRealistic, and Time-related.\n\n673\n00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.130\nSo specific, target a specific area for\nimprovement.\n\n674\n00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:51.850\nWhatever the remediation is, we have\nto be clear on what it's trying to fix.\n\n675\n00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:53.840\nThis remediation solution is for\n\n676\n00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.970\nwhen this has happened,\nnot when something else has happened.\n\n677\n00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:03.220\nMeasurable, I want to be able to\nmeasure if I'm making any progress.\n\n678\n00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.720\nIs my remediation working.\n\n679\n00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.980\nIt needs to be assignable.\n\n680\n00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.490\nI need to make sure it's something\nthat I can say, this is Cherokee,\n\n681\n00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:10.810\nnow your responsibility.\n\n682\n00:36:12.228 --> 00:36:16.605\nRealistic, all right Cherokee, I expect\nyou to you know to fly to Mars and\n\n683\n00:36:16.605 --> 00:36:18.085\npick up some rocks and bring them back.\n\n684\n00:36:18.085 --> 00:36:19.625\nNot real realistic.\n\n685\n00:36:19.625 --> 00:36:22.425\nSo it needs to be realistic and\ntime related.\n\n686\n00:36:22.425 --> 00:36:24.647\nWhen results can be achieved.\n\n687\n00:36:24.647 --> 00:36:28.307\nThose are some things we should\nthink about when we're we're\n\n688\n00:36:28.307 --> 00:36:30.997\ndeveloping our remediation plans.\n\n689\n00:36:30.997 --> 00:36:34.277\nAnd then the last thing,\nverification and quality control.\n\n690\n00:36:34.277 --> 00:36:36.497\nI really wanna define\nsome of these terms or\n\n691\n00:36:36.497 --> 00:36:38.957\ndifferentiate between some of these terms.\n\n692\n00:36:38.957 --> 00:36:43.677\nAudits, evaluations, assessments,\nmaturity model and certification.\n\n693\n00:36:43.677 --> 00:36:46.117\nAudits and evaluations and\n\n694\n00:36:46.117 --> 00:36:51.730\nassessments kind of all sound very,\nvery similar but they're not.\n\n695\n00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:53.850\nAll right, when we talk about it in audit,\n\n696\n00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:58.060\nwhen an auditor comes in\nit's typically third party.\n\n697\n00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.100\nIt's somebody outside.\n\n698\n00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.130\nAnd we can't do our own audits.\n\n699\n00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:05.420\nBut most of the time an audit is done we\nmight do our own audit in preparation for\n\n700\n00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.570\nthe actual audit.\n\n701\n00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:12.440\nBut the idea behind audit is impartial\nview of our current status and\n\n702\n00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:17.380\nprocedures, and how they are working and\nwhether we meet if there\n\n703\n00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:21.430\nis a standard that we're trying to follow\nor if we are trying to get certified.\n\n704\n00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.190\nWe'll talk about that again in a second.\n\n705\n00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.770\nAudit is how we can prove that and\nwe can verify that.\n\n706\n00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:31.710\nOr we can find out where we're lacking,\nand then take measures to improve or\n\n707\n00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.880\nremediate those.\n\n708\n00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:40.830\nWhereas an assessment is really\na point in time and look at a system.\n\n709\n00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:43.610\nAudits can be spread out over time,\nand assessments can too.\n\n710\n00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:45.400\nBut a lot of times,\naudits are spread out over time and\n\n711\n00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.850\nthey're looking at everything from\nthe passage period of time like year,\n\n712\n00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.230\nwhere the assessment is really\ntaking a quick snap shot.\n\n713\n00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:56.910\nAnd assessments and\nevaluations are kind of similar but\n\n714\n00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:58.470\nthey are usually more helpful.\n\n715\n00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.800\nIf somebody, if I'm getting an audit,\nthey're gonna come in and tell me,\n\n716\n00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.255\nthis is what you failed, this is what\nyou failed, this is what you succeeded.\n\n717\n00:38:04.255 --> 00:38:06.210\nCheck,check,check,fail,fail,fail.\n\n718\n00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.680\nHere you go.\n\n719\n00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.630\nAnd then I go and I cry in the corner,\nand then I say, all right.\n\n720\n00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:13.830\nIt's time to start fixing\nall of this stuff.\n\n721\n00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:19.090\nWhereas an assessment is hey,\nthis is not right.\n\n722\n00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:23.680\nBut let's look at why it's not right and\nwhat we might do to fix it.\n\n723\n00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.630\n&gt;&gt; So sweet.\n\n724\n00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n725\n00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.810\nThey're nicer.\n\n726\n00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.570\nAssessments are nicer than audits.\n\n727\n00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.610\nThey are typically meant\nas a helpful thing, so\n\n728\n00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:36.310\nI might do an assessment in\npreparation for an audit.\n\n729\n00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.900\nWhat else do we have on there,\n\n730\n00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.260\nmaturity models,\nI'll jump back over to my computer here.\n\n731\n00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.550\nThe one that always stuck out for\nme was the ITIL maturity model but\n\n732\n00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.060\nthere are several out there.\n\n733\n00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.230\nITIL has one that's just easy to look at.\n\n734\n00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.270\nAnd they got actually a free one.\n\n735\n00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:56.310\nThey've got a high level assessment\nservice, and a full assessment service.\n\n736\n00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:59.290\nYou see a model contains\na set of 30 questionnaires.\n\n737\n00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.430\nOne questionnaire for\neach of the 26 ITIL processes.\n\n738\n00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.103\nSounds like fun times in your future.\n\n739\n00:39:04.103 --> 00:39:05.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n740\n00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:09.140\nthe idea here is to find\nout where you're at.\n\n741\n00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.610\nHow are you doing.\n\n742\n00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.310\nIs everything working the way it should.\n\n743\n00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:18.780\nYour business processes in\nrelation to your IT processes,\n\n744\n00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.380\nare they functioning properly.\n\n745\n00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.320\nSo you have all of this in place.\n\n746\n00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.490\nIt is documented.\n\n747\n00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:31.860\nAnd how much sure are you in that\nrespect and that's what those are for.\n\n748\n00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.720\nYou can go and you can down,load\nthe IT maturity model and\n\n749\n00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:41.020\nyou can read through there talks\nabout this maturity levels.\n\n750\n00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.611\nI don't think there's anything\nexciting I wanna show you but\n\n751\n00:39:44.611 --> 00:39:48.348\nit's really available so\ngot check that ITIL maturity models.\n\n752\n00:39:48.348 --> 00:39:51.110\nAnd then certification's the last term.\n\n753\n00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.310\nAnd Cher, you already hinted at this.\n\n754\n00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:57.260\nWhen we look at some of those frameworks\nlike ISO, some of their frameworks,\n\n755\n00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.950\nyou can become certified in those.\n\n756\n00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:03.190\nAnd when you're certified,\nyou have passed their audits.\n\n757\n00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.550\nYou're in full compliance.\n\n758\n00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:10.500\nAnd you typically get a badge or\na certificate\n\n759\n00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.780\nproving that you are compliant\nwith that particular standard.\n\n760\n00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:18.620\nAnd maybe that's just something your\nbusiness wants to do to set it aside from\n\n761\n00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.610\nits competitors.\n\n762\n00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:24.610\nMaybe it's something that's required in\nyour industry that you are certified to\n\n763\n00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:28.992\nmaintain your status in that industry.\n\n764\n00:40:28.992 --> 00:40:32.290\nCertification is typically\nsomething I can go through\n\n765\n00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.770\nto get certified in a particular standard.\n\n766\n00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:39.690\nSo a lot there in the last couple episodes\nabout the good old frameworks, policies,\n\n767\n00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:41.499\ncontrols, procedures.\n\n768\n00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.660\n&gt;&gt; We have covered quite a bit,\nMike, so thank you so much for that.\n\n769\n00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:50.500\nBut it looks like we have pushed that\nproverbial envelope of time so to speak.\n\n770\n00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:53.190\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nsign off for this particular show.\n\n771\n00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:55.590\nThank you for joining us today and\nthank you ladies and gentleman for\n\n772\n00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.510\nbeing there for us as well.\n\n773\n00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.510\nBut remember I'm your\nshow host Cherokee Boose\n\n774\n00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:00.380\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n775\n00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.897\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n776\n00:41:02.897 --> 00:41:09.546\n[MUSIC]\n\n777\n00:41:09.546 --> 00:41:12.317\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

You're watching IT PRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:15.425\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst plus series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:17.190\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.782\nIn this episode, we will be looking\nat identifying and identity,\n\n7\n00:00:21.782 --> 00:00:23.997\nexcuse me, and access issues.\n\n8\n00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:26.621\nWith us today, we have Mr.\nMike Rodrick in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:26.621 --> 00:00:28.023\nThank you for joining us today Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:30.710\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Cherokee,\nexcited to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.283\nYeah, identity and access issues,\nreally in this objective,\n\n12\n00:00:34.283 --> 00:00:38.666\nthey want us to be able to, as you said,\nidentify identity and access issues.\n\n13\n00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.411\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To be a little bit of tongue\n\n14\n00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:41.043\ntwister there.\n\n15\n00:00:41.043 --> 00:00:45.727\nBut we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand what kind of security\n\n16\n00:00:45.727 --> 00:00:49.975\nissues are related to identity and\naccess management.\n\n17\n00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:55.268\nBecause if we understand what issues we\nmight have, we can plan for them, right?\n\n18\n00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:57.823\nAnd it seems to be the kind of\nthe theme over the last few episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:57.823 --> 00:01:01.020\nPlanning is a very important part.\n\n20\n00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.864\nWe don't want to deal with things in\nthe heat of the moment when a crisis has\n\n21\n00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.543\noccurred, because people\ndon't think clearly.\n\n22\n00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:10.955\nThey make odd decisions in\nthe heat of the battle.\n\n23\n00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:12.800\nAnd that's not what we want.\n\n24\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.078\nSo understanding what type of issues we\nmight have so that we can do our risk\n\n25\n00:01:17.078 --> 00:01:21.154\nassessment, we can put in the proper\ncontrols to hopefully prevent.\n\n26\n00:01:21.154 --> 00:01:26.041\n&gt;&gt; Going back to our little analogies or\nmetaphors, we have one.\n\n27\n00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.153\nAn ounce of prevention is\nworth a pound of cure.\n\n28\n00:01:28.153 --> 00:01:31.082\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is, you're absolutely right.\n\n29\n00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:36.397\nAnd it's a very good point because it's\na lot easier to prevent something.\n\n30\n00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:39.951\nWell maybe I shouldn't say easier,\nbut you're better off preventing it\n\n31\n00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:43.690\nfrom happening than dealing with\nthe repercussions of once it has happened.\n\n32\n00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.755\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n33\n00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:51.258\nAll right, so let's start with\ncontext-based authentication, right?\n\n34\n00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:54.696\nFirst of all, what the heck is\ncontext-based authentication?\n\n35\n00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:59.052\nWhen we think of authentication\ntypically over the last decade,\n\n36\n00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.437\nit's been user name and password.\n\n37\n00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:06.499\nJust very simple information that we,\nsomething that we know, that we're\n\n38\n00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.342\nable to type in to a box, some kind of\ninput and then we can authenticate.\n\n39\n00:02:11.342 --> 00:02:12.583\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of funny though, Mike.\n\n40\n00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:17.250\nAren't a lot of industry professionals\nsaying that that's kind of an antiquated\n\n41\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.648\nmethodology and two factor authentication\nis really the way to go nowadays,\n\n42\n00:02:21.648 --> 00:02:22.269\nat least?\n\n43\n00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes, for sure, I mean, really,\n\n44\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.792\nI like to say that password based\nauthentication is probably the weakest\n\n45\n00:02:28.792 --> 00:02:33.373\nform of authentication you could use\nother than no authentication at all.\n\n46\n00:02:33.373 --> 00:02:36.470\nBecause it is just a string of numbers and\n\n47\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.036\nletters, or characters that I\ncould brute force if I want.\n\n48\n00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:42.439\nI can social engineer.\n\n49\n00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.688\nWe typically leave it up to the end\nuser to create their own passwords, so\n\n50\n00:02:46.688 --> 00:02:50.396\nthey don't come up with incredibly long,\nstrong passwords.\n\n51\n00:02:50.396 --> 00:02:52.371\nThey reuse them in several\ndifferent locations.\n\n52\n00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.471\nBecause who can manage 18, 25,\n\n53\n00:02:55.471 --> 00:03:00.179\n100 different long,\nstrong, complex passwords?\n\n54\n00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.295\nSo we start reusing them.\n\n55\n00:03:02.295 --> 00:03:07.805\nIt's just not the best way\nto go about authenticating.\n\n56\n00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:12.472\nBut it is a very easy authentication\nmethod to implement, right?\n\n57\n00:03:12.472 --> 00:03:13.822\nWe can have a database.\n\n58\n00:03:13.822 --> 00:03:16.104\nI mean,\nI can whip up a website in a few minutes,\n\n59\n00:03:16.104 --> 00:03:19.482\nthat has a database behind it that\nstores username and the passwords.\n\n60\n00:03:19.482 --> 00:03:20.608\nThey give you an input field.\n\n61\n00:03:20.608 --> 00:03:23.433\nYou type in your values and\nsend a simple query over the database.\n\n62\n00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:25.156\nI compare values.\n\n63\n00:03:25.156 --> 00:03:29.263\nIf they equal, great, if they don't,\nyou get the red x, very easy to implement.\n\n64\n00:03:29.263 --> 00:03:32.440\nAnd that's why I think we saw them for\nso long.\n\n65\n00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.659\nAnd keep in mind too, that security has\nnot been on the forefront as the computers\n\n66\n00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.204\nwere developed,\nas networks were developing,\n\n67\n00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:42.194\nwhen it came to the worldwide web,\nand things like that.\n\n68\n00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:46.858\nIt's only been the last few decades\nthat security has really become more\n\n69\n00:03:46.858 --> 00:03:51.686\nimportant and part of the software\ndevelopment life cycle, for example.\n\n70\n00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:53.916\nAnd we're starting to see\nsome of the weaknesses and\n\n71\n00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:56.070\nthe methods that we've used in the past.\n\n72\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.092\n&gt;&gt; It's just crazy to me.\n\n73\n00:03:57.092 --> 00:04:00.822\nI can't even, I mean, you guys I don't\nknow if I can even convey how crazy.\n\n74\n00:04:00.822 --> 00:04:04.731\nI start to go in thinking about\nall these different tangents.\n\n75\n00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:08.492\nBut you look at the end of last year,\nand then even here in 2017.\n\n76\n00:04:08.492 --> 00:04:10.561\nWe're just at the beginning\nof the year and\n\n77\n00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:13.734\nthis past weekend we were kind of\ntalking about that cloud bleed.\n\n78\n00:04:13.734 --> 00:04:16.808\nLast year we saw the IoT Botnets and\n\n79\n00:04:16.808 --> 00:04:22.746\nthe more devices we're inventing and\nputting onto the Internet,\n\n80\n00:04:22.746 --> 00:04:28.805\nit's just expanding this exponentially,\nto a great, who knows.\n\n81\n00:04:28.805 --> 00:04:34.068\nWe're gonna have all these\ndevices acting as potential bots,\n\n82\n00:04:34.068 --> 00:04:36.659\nto facilitate these attacks.\n\n83\n00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.695\nAnd it's not like it's\ngoing away any time soon.\n\n84\n00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:44.711\nSo in my opinion,\nwe're just gonna see an increase in,\n\n85\n00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:49.835\nI guess, the amount of attacks\nthat we'll be seeing that\n\n86\n00:04:49.835 --> 00:04:56.325\nnot just affect individual companies or\nindividuals themselves.\n\n87\n00:04:56.325 --> 00:05:00.716\nBecause, what we've seen with a lot of\nthese attacks recently is they're going\n\n88\n00:05:00.716 --> 00:05:04.926\nafter large backbone providers and\nbringing down portions of the Internet.\n\n89\n00:05:04.926 --> 00:05:07.630\nWe're affecting large\nportions of the Internet.\n\n90\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.394\nSo this is definitely something\nthat's just gonna continue and\n\n91\n00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:12.040\nget worse as we proceed through time.\n\n92\n00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.244\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely, and I'll say that we\njust talked about the Internet of things\n\n93\n00:05:16.244 --> 00:05:18.892\nand some of these devices\nthat are coming out now.\n\n94\n00:05:18.892 --> 00:05:20.448\nAnd just to give you my two cents.\n\n95\n00:05:20.448 --> 00:05:24.223\nIf you're going to buy a device, and you\nfind out that the password is hard coded,\n\n96\n00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:27.070\nthat you cannot get in there and\nchange the default password,\n\n97\n00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.183\ndon't buy the device.\n\n98\n00:05:28.183 --> 00:05:30.122\nFind another device that\ndoes the same thing, right?\n\n99\n00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:33.526\nThat is ridiculous that these\nvendors would put products out\n\n100\n00:05:33.526 --> 00:05:36.135\nthat you can't change\nthe default password.\n\n101\n00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:38.453\nWhy even have a password on the device?\n\n102\n00:05:38.453 --> 00:05:40.857\nBut anyway, that's another story,\nanother episode.\n\n103\n00:05:40.857 --> 00:05:44.168\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's kinda funny, someone\nactually had mentioned today online,\n\n104\n00:05:44.168 --> 00:05:45.489\nI'm trying to see who it was.\n\n105\n00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:50.796\nIt was Dave something, he speaks at\na lot of the Black Hat conferences.\n\n106\n00:05:50.796 --> 00:05:55.804\nAnd I think he was ex-NSA, but he said,\nin the future, whenever you have someone\n\n107\n00:05:55.804 --> 00:06:00.975\ncoming to bust your door in, they're just\ngonna shout out, Alexa unlock the door.\n\n108\n00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:04.223\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I thought that was pretty clever.\n\n109\n00:06:04.223 --> 00:06:05.843\n&gt;&gt; That is a good one, I like that.\n\n110\n00:06:05.843 --> 00:06:08.494\nAll right, so\nback to what we need to go over though.\n\n111\n00:06:08.494 --> 00:06:10.501\nContext-based authentication really,\n\n112\n00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:13.407\nIt's bringing in the multi-factor\nas Cherokee mentioned.\n\n113\n00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:16.077\nMulti-factor authentication is the wave,\nright?\n\n114\n00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:17.612\nWe can see biometrics being drawn in.\n\n115\n00:06:17.612 --> 00:06:22.490\nMulti-factor authentication, think back to\nyour security plus, more than one factor.\n\n116\n00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.998\nThere's a couple different factors\nwe can based authentication on.\n\n117\n00:06:24.998 --> 00:06:27.283\nSomething you know,\nsomething you have, something you are.\n\n118\n00:06:27.283 --> 00:06:29.841\nAnd passwords are something you know,\nright?\n\n119\n00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:32.250\nYou have an account and\nyou know the password that goes with it.\n\n120\n00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.263\nSomething you have might be like\na smart card, some kind of RFID device.\n\n121\n00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:41.641\nSomething you are, now we're talking\nbiometrics, fingerprints, retina scans,\n\n122\n00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:44.026\niris scans,\nwhatever they come up with next.\n\n123\n00:06:44.026 --> 00:06:48.520\nI love the ones that look at your blood\nvessels in your hand and stuff, and\n\n124\n00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.779\nreally cool stuff.\n\n125\n00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:52.752\nBut anyway, multi-factor just means we're\ngonna bring in more than one factor of\n\n126\n00:06:52.752 --> 00:06:53.439\nauthentication.\n\n127\n00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:58.231\nContext-based authentication means we're\ngonna bring in something else with it.\n\n128\n00:06:58.231 --> 00:07:01.834\nSomething to do, we're gonna put\nthe authentication into context,\n\n129\n00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:02.940\nif you will, right?\n\n130\n00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.235\nLike I might wanna allow higher\nmanagement, upper level management,\n\n131\n00:07:07.235 --> 00:07:11.758\nto access certain documents but\nonly when they're at their workstation.\n\n132\n00:07:11.758 --> 00:07:13.564\nIf they walked down to\nthe sales department and\n\n133\n00:07:13.564 --> 00:07:16.221\nthey sit at one of those people's\ncomputers, here let me show you.\n\n134\n00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:19.907\nAnd they go to access one of those\ndocuments from there, not allowed,\n\n135\n00:07:19.907 --> 00:07:20.540\nall right?\n\n136\n00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.802\nThey can access it while they're at work\nbut they can't access it when they're at\n\n137\n00:07:24.802 --> 00:07:28.220\nhome and they're RDPing in or\nthey're VPNing in to the network.\n\n138\n00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.477\nCuz we're gonna say,\nyou can access this, but\n\n139\n00:07:30.477 --> 00:07:32.520\nthe context is from this IP address range.\n\n140\n00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.476\nIf you're not coming from this IP\naddress range, you don't get access.\n\n141\n00:07:35.476 --> 00:07:37.118\nEven though you have permissions,\n\n142\n00:07:37.118 --> 00:07:39.588\nwe're adding another level\nto the authentication.\n\n143\n00:07:39.588 --> 00:07:41.801\nThat's that context-based authentication.\n\n144\n00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:45.151\nSo time, location, frequency.\n\n145\n00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:47.697\nMaybe you're only allowed to\naccess something so often.\n\n146\n00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:51.074\nIf you access it repeatedly, we're\ngonna think that something's wrong or\n\n147\n00:07:51.074 --> 00:07:52.296\nit's some type of attack.\n\n148\n00:07:52.296 --> 00:07:56.949\nThis is abnormal behavior and\nwe're not gonna allow it.\n\n149\n00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:00.532\nSo looking at that behavioral aspect\nof accessing the information.\n\n150\n00:08:00.532 --> 00:08:02.060\n&gt;&gt; That one is really interesting to me.\n\n151\n00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.920\nI've actually seen a prototype where\nsomeone created an algorithm, and\n\n152\n00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.850\nthey had a device.\n\n153\n00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.270\nIt actually looked like the Wii guitar.\n\n154\n00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:13.065\nAnd the way that the individual responded\nand pressed the keys on the guitar\n\n155\n00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:17.035\nin correspondence with these bubbles\nthat were floating across the screen.\n\n156\n00:08:17.035 --> 00:08:22.045\nThe software would analyze any kind\nof error rates and response times and\n\n157\n00:08:22.045 --> 00:08:23.130\nthings of that nature.\n\n158\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.440\nSo the individual wouldn't even\nhave to memorize the password and\n\n159\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.450\nthey couldn't share it or sell it.\n\n160\n00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.660\nIt was kind of that\nsubconscious base password.\n\n161\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really cool and\nthey do that with typing.\n\n162\n00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.140\nYou pause between certain letters or\nit takes you longer.\n\n163\n00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.960\nOr even some keyboards that can\nmeasure pressure that can tell you how\n\n164\n00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.280\nhard they type.\n\n165\n00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.280\nAnd you might type the same password,\nbut you type it differently from me.\n\n166\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.230\nAnd so, it's-\n&gt;&gt;

It does, It is a scary,\nscary thing honestly, how\n\n187\n00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:54.000\nbad it can affect you and\nhow hard it is to recover from that.\n\n188\n00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.204\nBut, yeah,\nidentity theft is definitely up there.\n\n189\n00:09:57.204 --> 00:10:02.003\nAnd we say identities,\nwe don't want to think just people, right,\n\n190\n00:10:02.003 --> 00:10:05.603\nwe want to think servers,\nendpoints, services.\n\n191\n00:10:05.603 --> 00:10:08.248\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n&gt;&gt; Roles, applications, right,\n\n192\n00:10:08.248 --> 00:10:10.090\nthese are all identities.\n\n193\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.960\nWe identify the role that\nthis person belongs to.\n\n194\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.820\nWell, what if I am able to get\nmy account put into that group?\n\n195\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.845\nAnd now I'm part of that role and\n\n196\n00:10:19.845 --> 00:10:24.270\nthen I get access to something that\nmaybe I shouldn't have access to.\n\n197\n00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.100\nAnd we'll talk about privilege escalation\nwhich is really what that is in just\n\n198\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.020\na moment.\n\n199\n00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:36.320\nUsing roles is a great way to\nassign permissions and rights.\n\n200\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.800\nIt's easier to manage hundreds or\nthousands or hundreds of thousands\n\n201\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.880\nof identities if I can group them up\ninto similar access requirements.\n\n202\n00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.630\nAnd then apply the permissions there.\n\n203\n00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.570\nBut it also means that I've got to audit\nthose roles because I've got to pay\n\n204\n00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:50.632\nattention to who's in them.\n\n205\n00:10:50.632 --> 00:10:52.910\nSomebody could get slipped in the role and\nI would never know.\n\n206\n00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:57.070\nHow often do you go and\ncheck your domain admin's membership list?\n\n207\n00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:00.420\nHopefully very often, hopefully you've got\na restricted group policy put in place.\n\n208\n00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.510\nBut that's the concept.\n\n209\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.630\n&gt;&gt; And not even just from\na technical standpoint but\n\n210\n00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.220\nwe also were speaking about\nphysical security controls.\n\n211\n00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.170\nAnd then I worked for a company and\nwe had colored lanyards and\n\n212\n00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.910\nthe color would actually represent\nthe role within that individual.\n\n213\n00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.110\nAnd if someone had I don't\nremember the color but\n\n214\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.380\nmaybe a green lanyard\nwould indicate a guest.\n\n215\n00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.540\nSo if you saw someone\nwith a green lanyard and\n\n216\n00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.750\nguests weren't allowed on\nthe production floor without an escort,\n\n217\n00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.700\nthen you would know,\nthat's my company policy.\n\n218\n00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.080\nSomething's going on here and\nyou could address the issue.\n\n219\n00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.180\nSo not just from a technical standpoint,\nbut\n\n220\n00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.320\nyou really have to think about\nall those different aspects.\n\n221\n00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, great point.\n\n222\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.290\nIdentity repositories\nare another big target for\n\n223\n00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.100\nthe bad actors because that's\nwhere all the accounts are stored.\n\n224\n00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.640\nRemember when we talk\nabout identity repository,\n\n225\n00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.200\nwe're talking about things like\nActive Directory, for example.\n\n226\n00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.980\nOr I'm trying to think of the oldie,\nwith eDirectory,\n\n227\n00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.185\nwith Novell,\nif anybody remembers that stuff.\n\n228\n00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:01.730\nTACACS, Radius, these would all be,\n\n229\n00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.090\nwhen they talk about at least in\nthis context, identity repositories.\n\n230\n00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:10.980\nAnd they have their weaknesses,\nlike TACACS, for example.\n\n231\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.950\nRadius is remote authentication\ndial-in user service.\n\n232\n00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:18.780\nIt's been around since I think 1990 or\nearly 90's is when that was developed.\n\n233\n00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.030\nBy the name, you can probably\ninfer that the time range there,\n\n234\n00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.120\nremote authentication\ndial-in user service, right?\n\n235\n00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.220\nThis was back when we were dealing with\nmodems and making dial-in connections.\n\n236\n00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.870\nOne of the issues with Radius\nwas that it only protected or\n\n237\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.900\nencrypted the actual password.\n\n238\n00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:43.040\nIt did not encrypt some of the header\ninformation and the associations that were\n\n239\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.650\ngoing on to set up the secure connection\nand the encryption of the password.\n\n240\n00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:53.070\nTACACS was Cisco's response, and\nTACACS Plus is Cisco's response or,\n\n241\n00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.660\nI shouldn't say response, but\ntheir implementation of Radius.\n\n242\n00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.740\n&gt;&gt; Their protocol, yeah.\n\n243\n00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's a proprietary from Cisco that\n\n244\n00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.530\nlooked at some of the weaknesses mid 90s,\n96, somewhere around there.\n\n245\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.890\nLooked at some of the weaknesses of\nRadius and tried to improve on that by,\n\n246\n00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.790\nin this case they encrypted\nthe entire protocol, right.\n\n247\n00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.580\nAs it was sending information back and\nforth and\n\n248\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.820\ndoing that authentication request.\n\n249\n00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.530\nSo we've got to protect those.\n\n250\n00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.600\nWe've got to make sure that, who can\ncreate accounts in that directory service?\n\n251\n00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.210\nHow easy it is to add a new account?\n\n252\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.790\nCan the help desk do it?\n\n253\n00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.907\nOr does it have to be signed\noff by upper level management?\n\n254\n00:13:30.907 --> 00:13:33.630\nIs there a procedure in place?\n\n255\n00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.837\nSome kind of checks to see\nwhat groups they go into?\n\n256\n00:13:36.837 --> 00:13:41.480\n[COUGH] We always stress\nlike in Security+ and\n\n257\n00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.521\na little bit of Network Plus, I guess.\n\n258\n00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:50.540\nBut using roles and\ngroups to manage permissions.\n\n259\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.900\nBut we've got to make sure\nthat we understand what roles.\n\n260\n00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.509\nIf I don't know what permissions go along\nwith that group and I just add somebody to\n\n261\n00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:01.615\nit, I could be giving them more\npermissions than they actually need.\n\n262\n00:14:01.615 --> 00:14:06.811\n&gt;&gt; That's where communication plays\na big part between the IT department and\n\n263\n00:14:06.811 --> 00:14:08.139\nhuman resources.\n\n264\n00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:12.882\nBecause who's to say it's my\nresponsibility to delegate or\n\n265\n00:14:12.882 --> 00:14:16.120\nallow or assign those permissions?\n\n266\n00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.870\nI should just be following what\nhas already been set forth.\n\n267\n00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:19.400\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n268\n00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.837\nSecurity issues associated with\nFederation and single signon, right?\n\n269\n00:14:24.837 --> 00:14:28.245\nWe're talking about Federation,\ngood old Microsoft's Federation Services,\n\n270\n00:14:28.245 --> 00:14:28.805\nfor example.\n\n271\n00:14:28.805 --> 00:14:32.255\nThat's just Microsoft's implementation\nof a federated solution.\n\n272\n00:14:32.255 --> 00:14:37.135\nAnd when we talk about a federated\nsolution we're talking about sharing or\n\n273\n00:14:37.135 --> 00:14:38.765\ntrusting, I guess, is a better word.\n\n274\n00:14:38.765 --> 00:14:43.200\nTrusting the authentication process\nthat has occurred in somebody else's\n\n275\n00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.230\nsystem, right?\n\n276\n00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.840\nFor example-\n&gt;&gt; Kind of, go ahead.\n\n277\n00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.970\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, after you.\n\n278\n00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:51.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if Mike doesn't know you but\n\n279\n00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.250\nI know you, I can say,\nhey Mike, I know this person.\n\n280\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.020\nThey're a really great friend,\nwe've been friends for a long time.\n\n281\n00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:03.642\nAnd because I know you and trust you, now\nMike is going to trust you as well, right?\n\n282\n00:15:03.642 --> 00:15:07.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so we'll see federations\nset up between businesses where,\n\n283\n00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.220\nlet's say I'm a manufacturer and\n\n284\n00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.830\nI have to buy raw materials\nfrom another organization.\n\n285\n00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.440\nSo I need to go to their website,\nI need to authenticate,\n\n286\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:23.180\nI need to put in my orders,\nbe able to check on my order status.\n\n287\n00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.030\nCancel orders, things like that.\n\n288\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.050\nWell, that means that I've got my\nusername and password that I use,\n\n289\n00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.750\nwhatever my authentication method is for\nmy network.\n\n290\n00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.030\nAnd then when I connect to their network\nI've got another set of credentials that I\n\n291\n00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.430\nuse to authenticate there by their system.\n\n292\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.670\nFederation is when we\nset up a trust between\n\n293\n00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.880\nour,\n&gt;&gt; The service provider.\n\n294\n00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.093\n&gt;&gt; Identity, yeah.\n\n295\n00:15:46.093 --> 00:15:46.968\n&gt;&gt; Yes, to say, look,\n\n296\n00:15:46.968 --> 00:15:50.304\nI'm not gonna be sharing more information\nthan what I really need to be sharing.\n\n297\n00:15:50.304 --> 00:15:51.223\nWe have to trust them.\n\n298\n00:15:51.223 --> 00:15:54.508\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so\nwhen I log into my system at my work And\n\n299\n00:15:54.508 --> 00:15:58.742\nI go to connect to that other system\nwith that raw material supplier,\n\n300\n00:15:58.742 --> 00:16:03.122\nit can take my authentication\ninformation from my domain controller,\n\n301\n00:16:03.122 --> 00:16:06.430\nthat's already proved my\nidentity send it over.\n\n302\n00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:11.080\nTheir organization says, you were\nauthenticated by that other businesses,\n\n303\n00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.250\nbut we've got a trust.\n\n304\n00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.960\nSo I've been told to trust them, so I'm\njust gonna assume that they did their job,\n\n305\n00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.410\nthey authenticated you.\n\n306\n00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.457\nAnd I'll accept that authentication token,\n\n307\n00:16:19.457 --> 00:16:21.879\neven though it wasn't\ngenerated by our systems here.\n\n308\n00:16:21.879 --> 00:16:25.218\n&gt;&gt; And that's assuming, Mike, so we gotta\nbe careful with that sometimes, right?\n\n309\n00:16:25.218 --> 00:16:27.097\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It definitely is.\n\n310\n00:16:27.097 --> 00:16:29.372\nAnd it can get you in trouble.\n\n311\n00:16:29.372 --> 00:16:33.037\n&gt;&gt; Anytime you're doing business with\nanother entity, you really should look at\n\n312\n00:16:33.037 --> 00:16:36.753\nthose underpinning components because\n&gt;&gt; You really don't know how they're\n\n313\n00:16:36.753 --> 00:16:37.840\nhandling it or what they're sharing.\n\n314\n00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.760\n&gt;&gt; You definitely have to trust.\n\n315\n00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:47.020\nIn Microsoft, for example, you're creating\nrelying party trusts and federated trusts.\n\n316\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.290\nSo you are inferring that, hey, I trust\nyour organization is handling things\n\n317\n00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.070\nproperly, but\nyou definitely have to vet it.\n\n318\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.390\nYou have to make sure that you do\ntrust them before you set it up,\n\n319\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.330\nMicrosoft provides Federation\nservices out in the cloud.\n\n320\n00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.980\nSo that, let's say I have a business,\n\n321\n00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.150\nCherokee has a business, we don't\nwant to set up federation between us.\n\n322\n00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.340\nIt's a lot of complicated work,\na lot of, as you said, trust.\n\n323\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.020\nMicrosoft has their federation services,\nif she's federated with them, and\n\n324\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.520\nI'm federated with them,\nwe can kind of go through.\n\n325\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.609\nBut again, this is not a test on\nany particular federated service or\n\n326\n00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:19.200\nvendor specific things.\n\n327\n00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.401\n&gt;&gt; But it's not a bad idea to understand\nin real life cuz we see it all the time.\n\n328\n00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:26.506\nAnd I hate to keep bringing up this\ncloud bleed but it was really, I think,\n\n329\n00:17:26.506 --> 00:17:29.620\na big eye opener for\na lot of people because we saw an issue\n\n330\n00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.390\nwith their systems with a memory\nbuffer flow type issue.\n\n331\n00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:39.137\nAnd with their individual companies like\nFit Bit and Uber, that they support,\n\n332\n00:17:39.137 --> 00:17:45.078\nthose individuals, their customer data\nwas getting transposed, and mixed up.\n\n333\n00:17:45.078 --> 00:17:49.010\nSo one persons cash was getting\ninto another system and You know,\n\n334\n00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:53.229\nyou trust this company to house all\nyour information, like Uber, but\n\n335\n00:17:53.229 --> 00:17:56.410\nwho are they sending your information to?\n\n336\n00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.595\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, see that wouldn't be difficult,\n\n486\n00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.090\nyou could find out what the district\nmap is for that school.\n\n487\n00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You could see what roads existed there,\n\n488\n00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.400\nthere's probably not that many of them,\nand\n\n489\n00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.810\ngiven the right authentication mechanism,\n\n490\n00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:53.110\nit's not doing any lockouts, you could\nguess all day until you get that right.\n\n491\n00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.880\nSo, be careful with that.\n\n492\n00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.880\nExploits, let's dive into the world of\nexploits, a lot of this will harken back\n\n493\n00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.370\nto security plus so I'm not gonna spend\na lot of time on the actual exploits.\n\n494\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.840\nBut impersonation is one that\nthey call out on the objectives.\n\n495\n00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.880\nAnd impersonation is usually\nthe first line of an attack.\n\n496\n00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.418\nThis goes into social engineering and\nwhen we do impersonation that could be-\n\n497\n00:26:13.418 --> 00:26:15.660\n&gt;&gt; Recon, footprinting kind of thing?\n\n498\n00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.660\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nyou're calling up an employee, a user,\n\n499\n00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.800\nan end user, and you're saying,\nhey this is so and so\n\n500\n00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.660\nwith IT, we are migrating our systems\nover to a new database application,\n\n501\n00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.120\nwant to make sure that you have access so\nthat your access is not interrupted.\n\n502\n00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.260\nWhat is your username and password so\nI can input it in the new system, right?\n\n503\n00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.582\nHopefully most of us don't fall for\n\n504\n00:26:35.582 --> 00:26:38.546\nthat one anymore cuz that's the example\nwe've been using for years and years.\n\n505\n00:26:38.546 --> 00:26:41.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But the whole,\n\n506\n00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.287\nwe all should know by now.\n\n507\n00:26:43.287 --> 00:26:46.380\nAnd I know that you in my audience here\nare not the ones I'm preaching to,\n\n508\n00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.510\nthis is an end user thing.\n\n509\n00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.790\nBut nobody's ever gonna ask you for\nyour username and password,\n\n510\n00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.660\nif they do, don't respond to them, right.\n\n511\n00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.990\nIf my bank sends me an email and\n\n512\n00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.250\nsays hey, here was a great\nDilbert cartoon not too long ago.\n\n513\n00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.001\nAnd I'll have to see if I can pull that\nup and I'll bring it one of the episodes.\n\n514\n00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:04.871\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it was basically in the end,\n\n515\n00:27:04.871 --> 00:27:07.603\nthe bank was saying hey we forgot\nyour password to your account,\n\n516\n00:27:07.603 --> 00:27:09.520\ncould you please send it to us?\n\n517\n00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.850\nAnd hey, looks legit,\nhere's my information.\n\n518\n00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.880\nAnyway, I forgot where I\nwas going with that, but\n\n519\n00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:19.130\nimpersonation could be in person, could\nbe somebody putting on a set of overalls,\n\n520\n00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:22.670\nor a three piece suit and coming in, and\nsaying hey, I'm here to do your audit.\n\n521\n00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.440\nOr, I'm here to fix your phones,\ncan you point me to the server closet?\n\n522\n00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.300\nName dropping is an easy one,\nit's easy to gather that information\n\n523\n00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.310\nfrom publicly available resources,\ndo it over the phone, impersonating.\n\n524\n00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:36.520\nBig organizations,\nyou don't know everybody that works there,\n\n525\n00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.280\nyou don't know them by voice, you haven't\ndealt with everybody in the IT department.\n\n526\n00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.480\nWhen so I say, is Mike from IT,\nwell, you know, I don't know,\n\n527\n00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.955\nthere probably is a Mike\ndown in the IT department.\n\n528\n00:27:46.955 --> 00:27:50.045\nAnd you can find that information out.\n\n529\n00:27:50.045 --> 00:27:51.165\nSo, impersonation.\n\n530\n00:27:51.165 --> 00:27:52.955\n&gt;&gt; There was one that\nwas really interesting.\n\n531\n00:27:52.955 --> 00:27:55.545\nI think the guy's name was,\nlet me see here.\n\n532\n00:27:55.545 --> 00:27:56.923\nKevin Rouse or Rose but\n\n533\n00:27:56.923 --> 00:28:00.848\nhe was a journalist who dared\na hacker to ruin his life, he said.\n\n534\n00:28:00.848 --> 00:28:06.146\nSo I don't remember the name of the\nhacking team that accepted this challenge,\n\n535\n00:28:06.146 --> 00:28:07.807\nbut it was interesting,\n\n536\n00:28:07.807 --> 00:28:12.255\nthey didn't even have to perform\nany kind of technical skill set.\n\n537\n00:28:12.255 --> 00:28:15.745\nAt the beginning it was\njust simply impersonation.\n\n538\n00:28:15.745 --> 00:28:18.465\nThe girl got on the phone,\nshe started playing,\n\n539\n00:28:18.465 --> 00:28:21.325\nit was to his cell phone provider,\nI think it was Verizon.\n\n540\n00:28:21.325 --> 00:28:23.245\nI don't know,\nI don't wanna call them out here.\n\n541\n00:28:23.245 --> 00:28:28.105\nBut she got on the phone and\nthere were security controls set up like\n\n542\n00:28:28.105 --> 00:28:31.400\npasswords or PIN numbers on his account.\n\n543\n00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:36.010\nBut she had a YouTube video of some baby\ncrying and she gave him the guilt trip.\n\n544\n00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:39.970\nShe's like I'm so sorry, my husband's\ngonna be really upset if I don't get this\n\n545\n00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:41.260\nresolved by the end of the day.\n\n546\n00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.740\nWe've been working really hard with this\nissue, and kind of had a back story.\n\n547\n00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.190\nThat customer service representative\nliterally handed that information over and\n\n548\n00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:54.350\nended up locking the legitimate user\nout of his cellphone provider 100%.\n\n549\n00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.152\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I remember reading that.\n\n550\n00:28:56.152 --> 00:28:57.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was a great article.\n\n551\n00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.060\nIf you find it, let us know\nbecause you guys were not there.\n\n552\n00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:04.767\nWe've really enjoyed reading it cuz he did\nask for it to be done and he [LAUGH] I\n\n553\n00:29:04.767 --> 00:29:10.034\nthink in the end he's like, when this is\nover cuz we're really not enjoying this.\n\n554\n00:29:10.034 --> 00:29:13.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they wouldn't several iterations\nof what could go wrong with his life.\n\n555\n00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.140\n&gt;&gt; It was good times.\n\n556\n00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:20.850\nSo you had impersonation and all along\nthose same lines I know most of you have\n\n557\n00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:25.320\nheard of Kevin Mitnick, famous attacker\nhere in the states, one of the early ones.\n\n558\n00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.150\nI think one of the first\never to be prosecuted and\n\n559\n00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:32.830\nspend jail time but don't quote\nme on that but one of the first.\n\n560\n00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.440\nWhen he got out I remember watching\nthe interview with him and\n\n561\n00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.528\nthey said what's the attack\nthat you're most proud of and\n\n562\n00:29:38.528 --> 00:29:41.010\nhe said 'well he did\nthe politically correct thing.\n\n563\n00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:44.640\nI'm not proud of any of them, but\nthe one that I was the most amazed about,\n\n564\n00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.950\nand I don't remember all the details,\nI should.\n\n565\n00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:52.510\nBut he got access to\na particular phone's companies.\n\n566\n00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:56.540\nThey were working on this brand new\nphone and he got, basically the entire\n\n567\n00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.820\nblueprints, the software for it,\nby calling them up and doing impersonation\n\n568\n00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.580\nand doing social engineering, got it all\nover the phone and had it all sent to him.\n\n569\n00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.880\nVery, very impressive, very dangerous,\nthe problem is, there is no patch for\n\n570\n00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.630\nhuman stupidity.\n\n571\n00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.232\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if I can say that on air.\n\n572\n00:30:10.232 --> 00:30:12.471\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But there is no patch for\n\n573\n00:30:12.471 --> 00:30:17.180\nthe human element, security awareness,\nsecurity training is extremely important.\n\n574\n00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.510\nMoving on through the exploits,\nthough, so we can wrap this one up,\n\n575\n00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.430\nman in the middle attacks, right?\n\n576\n00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:24.310\nMITMs, you might hear them referred to as,\nor man in the middle,\n\n577\n00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.850\nthis is simply when,\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n578\n00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:31.340\nIf you need a visual reminder, I've got\nthe bad guy sitting down there in red and\n\n579\n00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.760\nI'm gonna convince either\nend that I'm the other end.\n\n580\n00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.310\nI'm gonna convince the client that I'm\nthe server he's trying to talk to.\n\n581\n00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:42.160\nI'm gonna convince the server that I'm\nthe client that's trying to talk to him.\n\n582\n00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:48.180\nAnd I basically get the data to flow\nthrough my system, that's an MITM, usually\n\n583\n00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.005\ndone with impersonation and a little\nbit different level of impersonation.\n\n584\n00:30:52.005 --> 00:30:57.285\nEither MAC address spoofing, doing some-\n&gt;&gt; Really\n\n585\n00:30:57.285 --> 00:30:59.945\nthere's all sorts of ways\nyou can execute this attack.\n\n586\n00:30:59.945 --> 00:31:02.185\nI mean if you have physical\naccess it makes it super easy.\n\n587\n00:31:03.736 --> 00:31:07.176\nPortaneering into that switch or\nif you provide an actual wire tap but\n\n588\n00:31:07.176 --> 00:31:11.209\nnowadays we are using wireless and that\nmakes it even easier for the attacker, so\n\n589\n00:31:11.209 --> 00:31:14.860\nman in the middle attacks are definitely\nsomething to keep on the radar.\n\n590\n00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.617\n&gt;&gt; Definitely they are bad, they can\nbe passive man in the middle attacks\n\n591\n00:31:18.617 --> 00:31:19.690\nwhere-\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n592\n00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:21.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm just watching the data and\ncapturing information,\n\n593\n00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.020\nwhich can be bad enough, right if there's\nsensitive information going by there.\n\n594\n00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.070\n&gt;&gt; Blackmail, extortion, who knows what?\n\n595\n00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:30.400\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, or it can be\nan active man in the middle attack,\n\n596\n00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.810\nwhere I'm modifying data.\n\n597\n00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.092\nHey, we need to fire that Mike guy.\n\n598\n00:31:33.092 --> 00:31:34.680\n&gt;&gt;

Put in a good word for me.\n\n602\n00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you know,\nthey could be modifying that data.\n\n603\n00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.267\nThis can also lead into\na session hijacking.\n\n604\n00:31:44.267 --> 00:31:47.083\nIn fact a session hijacking\nis very similar and\n\n605\n00:31:47.083 --> 00:31:51.787\nit starts out with somebody sniffing and\nhere's what they're trying to do.\n\n606\n00:31:51.787 --> 00:31:57.237\nRather than try to break your username and\npassword, or steal your.\n\n607\n00:31:57.237 --> 00:31:59.039\nInformation and authenticate as you.\n\n608\n00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:02.110\nI'll just wait till you authenticate and\nyou have a valid session.\n\n609\n00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:05.460\nNow I'm gonna try to kinda\nknock you out of the way and\n\n610\n00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.740\ntake over where you were sitting.\n\n611\n00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:12.320\nSo, bad guy sniffing here,\nhe grabs a session ID, and\n\n612\n00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.530\nthen what's gonna happen is he's\ngoing to try to bump you off,\n\n613\n00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:19.190\nprevent you from reconnecting and\nuse that session ID to authenticate.\n\n614\n00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.220\nThis is stealing cookies, right?\n\n615\n00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.990\nA lot of times a cross site scripting\nattack is the beginning of a session\n\n616\n00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:28.340\nhijack cuz I can use cross site\nscripting to steal your cookies.\n\n617\n00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:32.350\nOnce I've got your cookies I can now\nauthenticate to the website as you\n\n618\n00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.640\nwith your information.\n\n619\n00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.350\nAnd the website's none the wiser.\n\n620\n00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.760\nIt assumes that I am you.\n\n621\n00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.950\n&gt;&gt;

Time limiting, very good stuff.\n\n633\n00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:08.180\nAnd this is all stuff that we've\nlearn over the last decades\n\n634\n00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.260\nthat we've kinda had an add\non as security because when\n\n635\n00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.770\nwe think about that when these\nprotocols are being developed.\n\n636\n00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:18.130\nWhat else, cross site scripting,\n\n637\n00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:22.020\nagain the idea is that the attacker,\none for of cross site scripting.\n\n638\n00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.120\nThere are definitely several types.\n\n639\n00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.610\nBut in its simplest form the bad guy\nis going to to inject malicious code\n\n640\n00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:29.920\non a web server.\n\n641\n00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:34.510\nHe's gonna find a vulnerable web server\nthat's going to allow him to inject code,\n\n642\n00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.310\ntypically a JavaScript or\nsomething like that,\n\n643\n00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.950\nsome type of script that can be executed.\n\n644\n00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:45.398\nAnd then what's gonna happen is the user\nIs going to visit that web page.\n\n645\n00:33:45.398 --> 00:33:48.490\nDifferent from phishing, I'm not\nredirecting you to a malicious web server,\n\n646\n00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.170\nthis is an actual valid web server\njust happens to be vulnerable and\n\n647\n00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.320\nI've been able to add some\nmalicious code to it.\n\n648\n00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.490\nSo step two the user then connects to this\nwebsite unknown are unbeknownst to him\n\n649\n00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:04.950\nthat the malicious code has\nbeen injected out there.\n\n650\n00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:10.970\nSo when he does that www or that http get\nrequest, and he gets that web page, his\n\n651\n00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:15.170\nbrowser loads it up and executes all the\ncode, because it's coming from the server.\n\n652\n00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.760\nIt has no reason, the browser's doing\nexactly what it's supposed to do.\n\n653\n00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.410\nIt's supposed to interpret that script,\nexecute that script.\n\n654\n00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:23.196\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe all know browsers are super secure.\n\n655\n00:34:23.196 --> 00:34:25.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They are, absolutely.\n\n656\n00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:27.880\nAnd then what that script\nis gonna do is say, hey,\n\n657\n00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.860\nsend your cookie information\nover to attacker here.\n\n658\n00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.890\nSo now everybody that visits that site.\n\n659\n00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:34.270\nI'm just sitting back collecting cookies.\n\n660\n00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:35.260\nI'm like the cookie monster.\n\n661\n00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.840\nI'm just taking them all in and now I'm\njust gonna authenticate as different\n\n662\n00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.950\npeople at random or sell that information\nor whatever I choose to do with it.\n\n663\n00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:45.290\nCross site scripting is really dangerous.\n\n664\n00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:49.900\nIt's really hard to detect from\nan end users point of view because\n\n665\n00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.150\nthey're just visiting a web site and\nit's out of their control.\n\n666\n00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:57.980\nIt's the web site itself that's\nactually the vulnerable party here.\n\n667\n00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.160\nLast two more things.\n\n668\n00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.820\nI promise we're almost done Cherokee.\n\n669\n00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.630\nPrivilege escalation,\npretty straight forward concept there.\n\n670\n00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:09.469\nThis is a definitely a step\nin attackers progression as\n\n671\n00:35:09.469 --> 00:35:15.620\nthe bad guys try to get access to\nyour network they steal credentials,\n\n672\n00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.590\nthey break credentials, typically\nnot the ones that they want though.\n\n673\n00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:22.887\nWe're lucky if we get the administrator\naccount on the first try or\n\n674\n00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:26.010\nwe get a super user of some\nkind who has those credentials.\n\n675\n00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.629\nBut typically we end up with a lower level\nbecause those are the ones that are easy\n\n676\n00:35:29.629 --> 00:35:30.930\nto social engineer.\n\n677\n00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.840\nPeople write them down so\nwe're gonna see them more often.\n\n678\n00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.568\nThey might be easier to get.\n\n679\n00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:38.920\nWell, once I've got those you might think,\nwell that stinks.\n\n680\n00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.810\nI'm just a lowly end user\nthat has little access.\n\n681\n00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:43.120\nYou're in the system though.\n\n682\n00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.760\nYou're past that point.\n\n683\n00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.770\nNow all we have to do is called\na privileged escalation attack.\n\n684\n00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:53.270\nDepending on the system,\nit might be as easy as a net user add.\n\n685\n00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.880\nYou know, adding to a group,\nadding to the domain admin's group.\n\n686\n00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:00.140\nIf we can get a reverse show\nwith administrative credentials,\n\n687\n00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.040\nI can simply add that user account\nto the administrative group.\n\n688\n00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.330\nNow I've got administrative access.\n\n689\n00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:05.710\nOf course, if I've got the reverse shell,\n\n690\n00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.570\nI might already have\nadministrative access.\n\n691\n00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:08.680\nBut you get the idea.\n\n692\n00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.790\n&gt;&gt; And all these random pieces of software\nand applications that are out there,\n\n693\n00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:12.960\neven on our mobile devices.\n\n694\n00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.505\nYou don't know what level they're\naccessing certain system components.\n\n695\n00:36:17.505 --> 00:36:19.985\nAnd we have these safeguards\nin place to prevent that.\n\n696\n00:36:19.985 --> 00:36:22.945\nBut if you look at an extreme secure,\nlike the Blackphone for\n\n697\n00:36:22.945 --> 00:36:26.945\ninstance, they prohibit those type\nof applications for a reason, right?\n\n698\n00:36:26.945 --> 00:36:31.165\nBecause sometimes a arbitrary\ncode can go ahead and\n\n699\n00:36:31.165 --> 00:36:33.285\nprovide that privilege escalation.\n\n700\n00:36:33.285 --> 00:36:37.375\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well you know, even with the\nprotections that Apple puts into place,\n\n701\n00:36:37.375 --> 00:36:38.385\nGoogle puts into place,\n\n702\n00:36:38.385 --> 00:36:41.510\nMicrosoft puts into place, we've seen\nbad apps come out and they do just that.\n\n703\n00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:44.810\nThey're sending information off to,\nI remember the one was,\n\n704\n00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:46.020\nactually I can't remember it.\n\n705\n00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:50.960\nThis one might have turned out to be\na false, but there was a flashlight app on\n\n706\n00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:57.235\nthe iPhone that was actually sending\noff information to some other site.\n\n707\n00:36:57.235 --> 00:37:01.285\nIt's a harmless flashlight application,\nwhat could it be doing?\n\n708\n00:37:01.285 --> 00:37:04.195\nAnd yeah,\nit's just siphoning off your data.\n\n709\n00:37:04.195 --> 00:37:05.827\nLast one is a rootkit.\n\n710\n00:37:05.827 --> 00:37:08.995\nAnd rootkits, again,\nhopefully we're familiar with that term.\n\n711\n00:37:08.995 --> 00:37:10.745\nRoot kit get down in between,\n\n712\n00:37:10.745 --> 00:37:13.725\nremember when we're talking about\ncomputer systems now a days, we've got\n\n713\n00:37:13.725 --> 00:37:17.195\na ring level security, you've got\nthe kernel, you got zero, one, two, three.\n\n714\n00:37:17.195 --> 00:37:18.970\nThe kernel's down in ring zero.\n\n715\n00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.000\nOr users, we reside at level three.\n\n716\n00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.852\nAnd the calls that we make\nto the kernel are filtered.\n\n717\n00:37:25.852 --> 00:37:29.310\nThere's a little bit of\na control going there.\n\n718\n00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:32.730\nWe don't get to, as an end user we\ndon't deal directly with the kernel.\n\n719\n00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.572\nAs I said abstraction layer\nthat goes on in there.\n\n720\n00:37:35.572 --> 00:37:37.920\nA rootkit slips down even\nbetween the kernel and\n\n721\n00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:43.250\nuser mode, making it very difficult to\ndetect, basically giving the attacker\n\n722\n00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:46.010\nfull control over the system,\nmakes it very easy to hide.\n\n723\n00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:49.930\nBecause if I click on Task Manger,\nthat call's going through, but\n\n724\n00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.940\nthe rootkit's in between me and\nthe kernel.\n\n725\n00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:55.070\nThe rootkit intercepts that call,\nand returns Task Manager.\n\n726\n00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.530\nBut with only the tasks\nthat it wants to show.\n\n727\n00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:00.050\nIt's gonna hide itself and\nany processes that it's doing.\n\n728\n00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:05.430\nVery, very dangerous, very hard to detect,\nextremely hard to get rid of as well.\n\n729\n00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:08.740\nOnce you have a rootkit on a system and\nyou've determined that it's\n\n730\n00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.230\nusually blow the system away-\n&gt;&gt; That's my opinion on it.\n\n731\n00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:16.220\nI've tried before very early on and\n\n732\n00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:20.670\nI would see those symptoms just popping\nback up again shortly thereafter.\n\n733\n00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:22.560\nSo It's a waste of time in my opinion.\n\n734\n00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.360\nIf you've got all your information backed\nup just go ahead and reform at that drive.\n\n735\n00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:27.907\n&gt;&gt; Get rid of it.\n\n736\n00:38:27.907 --> 00:38:28.582\nAll right, so\n\n737\n00:38:28.582 --> 00:38:32.480\nagain those are some of the exploits they\nspecifically call out on the objective.\n\n738\n00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.268\nJust wanna make sure we\nare familiar with those.\n\n739\n00:38:35.268 --> 00:38:40.147\nMike, we've covered several identity and\naccess issues in this episode.\n\n740\n00:38:40.147 --> 00:38:42.853\nI know that's a lot for\nyou guys to think about but\n\n741\n00:38:42.853 --> 00:38:47.407\nwho knows maybe you'll come up with the\nnext security control for your systems and\n\n742\n00:38:47.407 --> 00:38:51.836\nend users but that's gonna go ahead and\nwrap it up for this particular episode.\n\n743\n00:38:51.836 --> 00:38:54.220\nI'll sign off as your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n744\n00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:54.980\n&gt;&gt;

Glad to be back, Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.292\nThanks for having me and yep,\ncontinuing on with our good old CSA+.\n\n11\n00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:32.690\nAnd today we're gonna be looking\nat a few different things.\n\n12\n00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.620\nAnd we're talking about\nsecurity architecture.\n\n13\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.080\nAnd we wanna just kind of go through\nsome of these objectives that\n\n14\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.750\nCompT calls out for us.\n\n15\n00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.760\nAnd the first one is security\ndata analytics, right.\n\n16\n00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.970\nAnd data analytics is a big topic right\nnow, especially big data data analytics.\n\n17\n00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.410\nBecause that's really what we're\nseeing a lot of now, is we've, and\n\n18\n00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.970\nwe talk about big data, what do we mean?\n\n19\n00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.800\nIt's data that's large, right?\n\n20\n00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.010\nLarge amounts of data, not necessarily\nthat the data itself is big.\n\n21\n00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.620\nBut getting all this information together,\nand getting big data together,\n\n22\n00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.750\npulling information from all\nkinds of different sources.\n\n23\n00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.780\nBut then being able to make\nsense out of it, right,\n\n24\n00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.900\nbeing able to correlate that somehow.\n\n25\n00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.060\nBasically do data mining on it,\n\n26\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.630\nmake the information valuable, because you\ncan gather all kinds of information but\n\n27\n00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.980\nif you do not have any way to\ninterpret that information,\n\n28\n00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.000\nmine that information, make it relevant,\nit's not gonna do you a whole lot of good.\n\n29\n00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.990\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, with this copious amount of\ninformation that we're seeing gathered,\n\n30\n00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.120\nfrom a human perspective, trying to sift\nthrough all that can be very difficult.\n\n31\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.470\nSo we see a lot of third party utilities\nand programs that actually will create\n\n32\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.860\ngraphical representations and\nmaybe even kind of extract\n\n33\n00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.645\nrelationships between data objects to kind\nof bring that to our human attention.\n\n34\n00:01:56.645 --> 00:01:59.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly right, because there's\nno way you or I is going to sit here and\n\n35\n00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.260\nsift through this data and make sense out\nof it, it's just too much information.\n\n36\n00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.550\nSo definitely third party\nsoftware that allows you to,\n\n37\n00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.820\nonce its indexes the information\nit does its correlation.\n\n38\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.360\nThen we can usually run some\ntypes of queries against it,\n\n39\n00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.620\nfilter it down to get\nwhat we're looking for.\n\n40\n00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.000\nAnd give us some kind of summary of that\ninformation that's actually useful to us.\n\n41\n00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.920\nWe're doing it,\nthe bad guys are doing it too,\n\n42\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.370\nunfortunately, as they steal information.\n\n43\n00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.780\nSome information on it's own is not\nthat valuable, a set of usernames.\n\n44\n00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.800\nBut if I can find social\nsecurity numbers somewhere else,\n\n45\n00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.740\nstart correlating those two together,\n\n46\n00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.860\nnow that information becomes much more\nvaluable if I'm trying to sell that.\n\n47\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.660\nAnd that's what the bad\nguys are doing as well.\n\n48\n00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.240\n&gt;&gt; And yesterday we spoke about\nsome regulatory compliances and\n\n49\n00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.450\nthings like HIPAA.\n\n50\n00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.220\nIf we have to deconstruct and\nbreak down that pie, and\n\n51\n00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.430\nput it in separate components,\nand encrypt them separately, and\n\n52\n00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.390\nthings like that,\nthat's really what they are looking for\n\n53\n00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.800\nis just those little nuggets that can\nhelp fill in the puzzle pieces, right.\n\n54\n00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.710\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's exactly right,\nexactly right.\n\n55\n00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.770\nSo when we talk about data aggregation,\nagain,\n\n56\n00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.860\npulling all that information together,\ncorrelating it, and\n\n57\n00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.830\nwe're typically gonna be using\nsome type of software to do this.\n\n58\n00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.580\nAnd another thing we do with data\nanalytics is trend analysis, right.\n\n59\n00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.470\nTrend analysis is when we look\nat data over periods of time,\n\n60\n00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.840\nkind of like little snapshots.\n\n61\n00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.060\nAnd we look for a trend, or\na pattern, in that information.\n\n62\n00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.930\nWe might look at,\njust as a simple example,\n\n63\n00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.630\nI don't know,\nnumber of visitors to our website, right.\n\n64\n00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.700\nWe might see that, overtime,\nit's slowly going up.\n\n65\n00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.680\nOr after our latest update,\nwe see that the numbers going up.\n\n66\n00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.390\nThat would be trend analysis.\n\n67\n00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.370\nWe're saying, okay, if this continues on,\nthis is where we should be in the next\n\n68\n00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.490\nweek or the next month so\nwe can use that data to identify patterns.\n\n69\n00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.540\nOne of the issues that you can run\ninto though with trend analysis is not\n\n70\n00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.390\nhaving a good baseline, right.\n\n71\n00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.270\nAnd when we talk about security,\nlet's put it more into context what we're\n\n72\n00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.300\ndoing here, I'm talking about security\nwhen we look at trend analysis.\n\n73\n00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.449\nWe might be looking at\nbehaviors on our network.\n\n74\n00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:07.080\nLike a mound of a certain protocol\nthat normally occurs on our network.\n\n75\n00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.830\nAnd we see spikes in that activity\nevery day around the same time,\n\n76\n00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.360\nor once a week around the same time.\n\n77\n00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.780\nWe start to see that trend, right.\n\n78\n00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.840\nThat's trend analysis.\n\n79\n00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.520\nWe like, okay,\nwhat's going on here that's causing this?\n\n80\n00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.800\nOr just unusual amounts of data being\nsent out of our network, right.\n\n81\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.020\nNormally we see so much megabytes or\ngigabytes of data leaving our network,\n\n82\n00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.440\nand all of a sudden it's spiking\nway up more than normal.\n\n83\n00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.000\nThat would be, again,\nlooking at big data and\n\n84\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.570\nusing trend analysis to\nnotice those things.\n\n85\n00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.460\nThe issue that you run into, though,\nis not having a good baseline.\n\n86\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.480\nIf you don't know what your network\nnormally spits out, for example.\n\n87\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.100\nWhat is the normal amount of\ndata that's leaving my network?\n\n88\n00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.050\nWhat is the normal amount\nof logon attempts that I\n\n89\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.350\nhave between the hours of nine and ten?\n\n90\n00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.540\nIf I don't know what my baseline is\nit's gonna be extremely hard for\n\n91\n00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.230\nme to get any information, useful\ninformation, or do any trend analysis.\n\n92\n00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.936\n&gt;&gt; Sure, you have to be able to\nspot that anomaly in order to,\n\n93\n00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:06.811\nyou need to know what's normal\nin order to spot that anomaly or\n\n94\n00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:08.690\nanything that's different there.\n\n95\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.580\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n96\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.040\n&gt;&gt; And even if you are running some kind\nof continuous monitoring you can see,\n\n97\n00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.350\nlook, last year Mike used two\ngigs of a shared storage.\n\n98\n00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.290\nThis year, Mike's using four\ngigs of his shared storage.\n\n99\n00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.230\nAnd you can kind of anticipate, even for\nbudgeting purposes, what your company or\n\n100\n00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.230\norganization might need as far as growing\nroom and things of that nature as well.\n\n101\n00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.830\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, Cherokee.\n\n102\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.480\nAnd another issue we have with trend\nanalysis is that usually when we're taking\n\n103\n00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.770\nthose snapshots they're points in time of\na continuously changing metric, right.\n\n104\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.701\nSo we might not capture\nthe information when we chose to do\n\n105\n00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:51.515\nthat particular snapshot of time, right.\n\n106\n00:05:51.515 --> 00:05:54.460\nThere was a big spike in activity but\nit was right in between, say,\n\n107\n00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.090\ntwo snapshots that we took.\n\n108\n00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.620\nSo we don't see that in our\nanalysis because it is typically\n\n109\n00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.860\npoints in time snapshots.\n\n110\n00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.660\nThere's a period of time in between where\nwe're not capturing that information.\n\n111\n00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.160\nOther things we might do as far as\nwhen it comes to data analytics,\n\n112\n00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.679\nhistorical analysis.\n\n113\n00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.700\nThe biggest problem we have here,\n\n114\n00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.430\nhistorical analysis is just\nlooking back at past data.\n\n115\n00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.750\nWe can always learn from our past, right.\n\n116\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.500\nWe can take a look at what happened, and\nwe can try to, again, see patterns in it.\n\n117\n00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.830\nBut we're looking at actual\nhistorical data, and it allows us to\n\n118\n00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.800\nmaybe see where we're going, or\nlearn from past experience, and being able\n\n119\n00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.300\nto apply that towards future projects,\nor whatever it is that we're doing.\n\n120\n00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.210\nThe biggest problems you have with\nhistorical analysis is usually just\n\n121\n00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.680\ncollecting the data,\nbecause it is a large amount of data.\n\n122\n00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.080\nDo we still have that information?\n\n123\n00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.520\nHow long did we keep it?\n\n124\n00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.290\nAnd interpreting that\ninformation sometimes,\n\n125\n00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.940\nespecially if systems\nhave changed over time.\n\n126\n00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.290\nAnd then having people,\nthe analysts, if I can say that,\n\n127\n00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:05.320\nthat sit down, that are trained\nto look at that information and\n\n128\n00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.310\nget relative or\npertinent information out of that.\n\n129\n00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.000\nSo that can be challenging as well.\n\n130\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:17.020\nOther places that we want to look for\ninformation, manual reviews,\n\n131\n00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.890\nand they say manual reviews\non the exam objectives.\n\n132\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.910\nAnd I will tell you that manual\nreviews means I'm doing it manually.\n\n133\n00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.871\nBut a lot of this I see being automated,\nhonestly.\n\n134\n00:07:27.871 --> 00:07:28.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n135\n00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.790\nthat's what a lot of people in the IT\nindustry like to do, to simplify things.\n\n136\n00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.452\nWork a little smarter, not harder, right.\n\n137\n00:07:34.452 --> 00:07:36.330\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n138\n00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.972\n&gt;&gt; If I've got, I don't know,\n\n139\n00:07:37.972 --> 00:07:42.115\nhundreds of servers, I don't wanna go\nread all those log files manually,\n\n140\n00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:44.049\nlooking at them one line at a time.\n\n141\n00:07:44.049 --> 00:07:49.384\nI wanna be able to try to automate that\nand make it a little bit easier on myself.\n\n142\n00:07:49.384 --> 00:07:54.096\nBut things we're gonna wanna look for\nwhen we're talking about Security,\n\n143\n00:07:54.096 --> 00:07:57.335\nwhere are the best places to check for\ninformation,\n\n144\n00:07:57.335 --> 00:08:02.250\nto try to detect any type of breaches or\nanomalies that might be occurring.\n\n145\n00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.990\nThe firewall logs have to be\none of your first thoughts,\n\n146\n00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.930\nbecause if we think about it,\nif our network is set up properly,\n\n147\n00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.860\nall traffic is going to be\npassing through that firewall.\n\n148\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.470\nEspecially all inbound traffic should\ndefinitely be coming through the firewall.\n\n149\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.373\nSo by looking at those logs, I have\na record of all the data, all the packets,\n\n150\n00:08:19.373 --> 00:08:20.580\nall the protocol,\n\n151\n00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.120\nall the different connections that\nare coming through that firewall.\n\n152\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.021\n&gt;&gt; And now it's really important too,\nMike, because you're gonna get a call if\n\n153\n00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:32.036\nan application or\nservice isn't working on your network and\n\n154\n00:08:32.036 --> 00:08:34.790\nit might be a misconfigured\nfirewall setting.\n\n155\n00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.680\nBut it's not like the attacker's\ngonna call you and\n\n156\n00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.160\nsay hey, I just got in to your network,\n\n157\n00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.090\nthey're not gonna let you know about\nthose kind of malconfigurations.\n\n158\n00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.810\nSo it's kind of something you\nreally should be checking, right?\n\n159\n00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:44.640\n&gt;&gt; Typically not, yeah.\n\n160\n00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.195\nI don't know too many that do.\n\n161\n00:08:46.195 --> 00:08:47.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Although all of us\n\n162\n00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.991\nhere are ethical hackers, and\n\n163\n00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:53.138\nif we found something like that\n&gt;&gt; We would definitely notify them, right?\n\n164\n00:08:53.138 --> 00:08:54.131\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n165\n00:08:54.131 --> 00:08:55.402\nOkay.\n\n166\n00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:57.644\nSo, yeah, looking at those log files, and\n\n167\n00:08:57.644 --> 00:09:00.700\nmost firewalls have great\nlogging capabilities.\n\n168\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.020\nThe only concern is,\nhave you set it up properly, right?\n\n169\n00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.510\nHave you read your manual on your\nfirewall, do you understand how to set up\n\n170\n00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.130\nthe appropriate logging capabilities,\nwhat you want to capture?\n\n171\n00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.350\nSometimes, when we talk about logging,\nin general.\n\n172\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.817\nIt is much of an art as it is a science,\n\n173\n00:09:17.817 --> 00:09:23.091\nbecause you are trying to capture all\nthe part of information at the same time.\n\n174\n00:09:23.091 --> 00:09:27.383\nYou wanna limit how much information\nyou're getting because I could just\n\n175\n00:09:27.383 --> 00:09:31.813\ncapture every single thing and sometimes\nthat becomes too much information\n\n176\n00:09:31.813 --> 00:09:35.920\nespecially when most of it is expected and\nnormal behavior.\n\n177\n00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.840\nDo I need to capture all of that?\n\n178\n00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.140\nAnd unfortunately, usually the answer\nis you do have to capture most of it.\n\n179\n00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.915\nBut we can definitely, maybe filter\nthough, filter some of that out.\n\n180\n00:09:45.915 --> 00:09:49.985\nMaybe not capture all of it,\nbut at least capture it and\n\n181\n00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:54.565\nthen filter it on your displays when you\nstart doing your data analysis on there.\n\n182\n00:09:54.565 --> 00:09:57.274\nSo being able to work with\nthose firewall logs, and\n\n183\n00:09:57.274 --> 00:10:01.633\nwe'll take a look at some logging tools,\nbecause I know I've said this all week.\n\n184\n00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:04.693\nWe've got some episodes coming up where\nwe're going to do nothing but kind of run\n\n185\n00:10:04.693 --> 00:10:08.000\nthrough some different tools, and\nshow you how some of this actually works.\n\n186\n00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.860\n&gt;&gt; So when we're looking\nat tools like this Mike,\n\n187\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.360\nwould something like a utility like\nWireshark with the ability to go ahead,\n\n188\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.670\nand set these captures, and then export\nthem into logs to be sifted through,\n\n189\n00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.000\nwould that be follow under\nthis category as well?\n\n190\n00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so,\nbecause all logs are pretty much the same,\n\n191\n00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.090\nwhether it's a packet capture,\nwhether it's a firewall log, an IDS,\n\n192\n00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.800\nor an IPS, or a host based IDS or IPS.\n\n193\n00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.350\nJust understanding your product, making\nsure that you know how to manipulate it or\n\n194\n00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:41.830\nhow to work with that information,\nSys logs are another great one.\n\n195\n00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:47.066\nSys logs sure for system logs this is\ndone in most of our network devices,\n\n196\n00:10:47.066 --> 00:10:51.060\ntouters, switches, firewalls,\nalmost all of them support Syslog.\n\n197\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.600\nAnd Syslog is all about capturing\nan event in one place and\n\n198\n00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.520\nthen storing that event somewhere else,\n\n199\n00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.550\nsending that logging information to\na remote destination, a Syslog server.\n\n200\n00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:05.155\nSo you have clients or\nagents that run on the devices, and\n\n201\n00:11:05.155 --> 00:11:09.829\nthey take that information, and\nthey ship it back to your Syslog server.\n\n202\n00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:13.845\nOr your Syslog listener,\nhowever you wanna say that,\n\n203\n00:11:13.845 --> 00:11:17.775\nmost of our are going\nto support Syslogging,\n\n204\n00:11:17.775 --> 00:11:23.710\nI don't know if any of that, the don't and\nbeing a Windows guy for over a decade,\n\n205\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.947\nwe'll just leave it at that Syslog was\none of the things that I was always\n\n206\n00:11:28.947 --> 00:11:34.310\njealous of because Windows didn't\nhave that capability early on.\n\n207\n00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:37.530\nIt was all local logging, and\nwhen you look at the bad guys and\n\n208\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:43.920\nthe techniques and you learn how the bad\nguys are perpetrating their attack, during\n\n209\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:49.260\nthe final steps of an attack, cover your\ntracks, they're trying to wipe log files.\n\n210\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.870\nThey wanna remove any\nevidence of them being there.\n\n211\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.010\nThis is gonna make it harder for\nyou to discover what they did,\n\n212\n00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.000\nhow they got in, find out who they are,\nthings like that.\n\n213\n00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.260\nSo it's always a step in the attack,\nis to cover your tracks,\n\n214\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.940\nand clearing event logs\nis a very common process.\n\n215\n00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.130\nSo the problem with Windows servers\nwas the logs were on the server,\n\n216\n00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.740\nthat they were compromising, right?\n\n217\n00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.510\nSo, if I've broken in that server,\nthere's a good chance I can,\n\n218\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.725\nI've done my escalation of privileges,\nthere's a good chance I can view and\n\n219\n00:12:17.725 --> 00:12:18.927\nwipe your log files as well.\n\n220\n00:12:18.927 --> 00:12:22.372\nAnd the only thing you're gonna see if\nthe log file that was cleared at such and\n\n221\n00:12:22.372 --> 00:12:25.860\nsuch time by such and such user, and\nthat's not gonna be a lot of help.\n\n222\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.510\nNow, They've since added,\nMicrosoft added years ago, few years ago,\n\n223\n00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.710\nadded subscriptions where I can now\nsubscribe to event logs from one system.\n\n224\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.650\nSo as a IT person,\nI can sit at my laptop, and\n\n225\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.050\nI don't have to remote in\nall of my different servers.\n\n226\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.000\nThey can send their logs,\n\n227\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.760\nthey can basically subscribe to the logs,\nhave them shipped to my computer here.\n\n228\n00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.920\nAnd I can be very selective\nabout what I want shipped,\n\n229\n00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.610\nI don't have to ship the entire log.\n\n230\n00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.241\nI just want warnings,\nor events, or keywords.\n\n231\n00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:53.296\n&gt;&gt; It is really granular.\n\n232\n00:12:53.296 --> 00:12:54.120\n&gt;&gt; Things like that, yeah.\n\n233\n00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.771\n&gt;&gt; Crazy, even just a fake click on, even\nif they have access to a particular folder\n\n234\n00:12:57.771 --> 00:13:01.440\nand you just wanna see who's accessing\nthat folder, and things of that nature.\n\n235\n00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.990\nIt's pretty specific.\n\n236\n00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.870\n&gt;&gt; It really is, and that's the challenge\nof reading through log files,\n\n237\n00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:11.580\nis being able to kinda dive into or\nfilter out some of that information,\n\n238\n00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.730\nwhich Windows Event Log has great\nfiltering capabilities as well.\n\n239\n00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.466\nI know I seem to be pumping out Windows,\nI am a Windows guy, I drank the Kool-Aid.\n\n240\n00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:22.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I tend to do that too and I\nswear they don't pay me to say this stuff,\n\n241\n00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.812\nI wish they did.\n\n242\n00:13:23.812 --> 00:13:24.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n243\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.355\nme too, wouldn't that be nice.\n\n244\n00:13:26.355 --> 00:13:27.301\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But,\n\n245\n00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:30.740\nbeing that's how I made my money for years\nand years was working for Windows System.\n\n246\n00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.810\nSo I definitely enjoy them, and they are\none of the predominant servers that you\n\n247\n00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.460\nare going to see in\nenterprise environments.\n\n248\n00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.810\nSo understanding the tools\nthat you have available.\n\n249\n00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:46.530\nNow, that being said, there are third\nparty sys log clients that you can get for\n\n250\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.350\nWindows Systems,\nbecause if I have a mixed environment.\n\n251\n00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:54.470\nWhere I want to try and centralize all of\nthis, Syslog is probably the way to go.\n\n252\n00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.050\nSo getting my Windows clients,\nwhen I say Windows clients,\n\n253\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.820\nWindows operating system server,\nclient, whatever.\n\n254\n00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.272\nIf I can get them to participate in the\nSyslog server, send them there with all of\n\n255\n00:14:05.272 --> 00:14:09.665\nmy other firewall devices, router\nswitches, Linux boxes, Linux servers.\n\n256\n00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:12.977\nThose kinds of things, now it's all in one\nplace it's gonna make it even easier for\n\n257\n00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:13.650\nme to work with.\n\n258\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:17.140\nSo it's good to know that there are\nthird-party tools out there that we can\n\n259\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.540\nget that will work on\na Windows operating system,\n\n260\n00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:24.690\nthat will allow them to participate or\nto run a syslog agent or a syslog client.\n\n261\n00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.790\nSolar Winds as a free one, which is great.\n\n262\n00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.730\nIf you've ever dealt with Solar Winds,\nthey've got some incredible products.\n\n263\n00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.810\nAgain, they don't pay me either, I'm not\nsaying they're better than any other.\n\n264\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.980\nBut they do have a great free one that\nwill allow you to run it on Widows and\n\n265\n00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.240\nhave your Windows machines send their log\nfiles over to your sys log server, so\n\n266\n00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.120\nthat's a great idea there.\n\n267\n00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.090\nAuthentication logs are another\none that we should be monitoring.\n\n268\n00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.920\nWe want to look for not only failed\nattempts, a lot of times people mistakenly\n\n269\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.880\nthink, I'm going to look for\nfailed logon attempts.\n\n270\n00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.310\nWhich is good, as we were saying earlier,\n\n271\n00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.780\nsometimes we try to filter\nour logs down a little bit.\n\n272\n00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.450\nSo they're not capturing unnecessary data,\nso we can find the important data easier\n\n273\n00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.070\nbecause there's less\ninformation to look through.\n\n274\n00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.580\nSo they'll change their\n\n275\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.970\nauditing policies to include failed\nlogons only and not successful logons.\n\n276\n00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.730\nAnd at first that makes sense,\n\n277\n00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.470\nbecause I've got thousands of users that\nare authorized to use my systems and\n\n278\n00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.390\nI'm gonna have success, success,\nsuccess, success all over the place.\n\n279\n00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:33.090\nSo I don't wanna monitor that,\nI just wanna see the failed attempts.\n\n280\n00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:37.020\nThe problem with that is let's say you\nsee a bunch of failed attempts at 1:00 in\n\n281\n00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.450\nthe morning when nobody\nshould be on the network, so\n\n282\n00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.135\nyou're assuming somebody's doing some type\nof password attack, doing some password.\n\n283\n00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:44.515\nPassword guessing,\ndictionary talk, whatever.\n\n284\n00:15:44.515 --> 00:15:47.802\nSo you see this failed attempt, failed\nattempt, failed attempt, failed attempt.\n\n285\n00:15:47.802 --> 00:15:50.685\n&gt;&gt; Unless Mike was just a little,\nafter he went out and\n\n286\n00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:53.782\nwas at a party and\nhe couldn't remember his password.\n\n287\n00:15:53.782 --> 00:15:54.524\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's never happened before.\n\n288\n00:15:54.524 --> 00:15:58.566\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you've got all these failed attempts\n\n289\n00:15:58.566 --> 00:16:04.630\nat 1 o'clock, 1 until going on and on,\nand all of a sudden, they stop at 1:15.\n\n290\n00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:08.380\nNow, the question becomes, so now,\nyou know that somebody was doing,\n\n291\n00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.640\nwhat happened at 1:16?\n\n292\n00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.467\n&gt;&gt; Exactly!\n\n293\n00:16:10.467 --> 00:16:14.487\nDid the janitor walk by and scare\nthe attacker off and they had to leave,\n\n294\n00:16:14.487 --> 00:16:17.502\ndid they get tired and gave up,\ndr did they succeed and\n\n295\n00:16:17.502 --> 00:16:20.760\nguess the right password and\nlog in successfully?\n\n296\n00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.980\nYou don't know because you're not\nlogging successful attempts, right?\n\n297\n00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.580\nSo you want to plan out your strategy\nwhen it comes to auditing and\n\n298\n00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.870\nsetting up your logs,\nwhat information you're gonna capture.\n\n299\n00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.140\nAnd unfortunately, I know I said earlier\nthat you don't want to capture everything\n\n300\n00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.970\nbut, you kinda need to start that way, and\n\n301\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.380\nthen wean it down a little\nbit as you go if you can.\n\n302\n00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.960\nBut I'd rather capture too much\ninformation than not enough in the end,\n\n303\n00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.400\nbecause I can always filter it down,\n\n304\n00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.580\nI can't recapture missed opportunities,\nor missed data there.\n\n305\n00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.871\n&gt;&gt; There might not be an issue at all, but\n\n306\n00:16:55.871 --> 00:17:00.454\nif you start noticing a lot of failed\nattempts at strange hours of the day when\n\n307\n00:17:00.454 --> 00:17:03.405\nMike really shouldn't be\ndoing off hours work.\n\n308\n00:17:03.405 --> 00:17:07.417\n&gt;&gt; Then you can even look at things like\njust locking out that account during\n\n309\n00:17:07.417 --> 00:17:11.780\nthose times, and just tailor your needs\nto whatever your logs are going to be.\n\n310\n00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.860\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and you can,\nwhat was that, you said something,\n\n311\n00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.730\nlet me think, log correlation,\nyou are trying to,\n\n312\n00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:24.750\nI think we've mentioned this before but\nmaking sure that I have a way to\n\n313\n00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.610\nlook at events on different\nsystems at the same time, right.\n\n314\n00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.280\nAnd Syslog is one of the things\nthat gives me that ability,\n\n315\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.230\nbecause I've got all the logs\nfrom different devices, as like\n\n316\n00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.860\ntime synchronization, one of the reasons\ntime synchronization is so important.\n\n317\n00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:43.500\nSo that I can see what happens on\nthe system, I see this attack going on.\n\n318\n00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.203\nI wanna see what's going on at\nthe firewall at the same time or\n\n319\n00:17:46.203 --> 00:17:47.431\njust before that, right.\n\n320\n00:17:47.431 --> 00:17:47.960\n&gt;&gt; So being able to tell-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n321\n00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.150\neven pairing that like when you were\ntalking about historical analysis.\n\n322\n00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.499\n&gt;&gt; It's great because there might be\na precursor to an attack that it really\n\n323\n00:17:55.499 --> 00:17:59.706\ndoesn't affect the network in a large way,\nbut going back and looking\n\n324\n00:17:59.706 --> 00:18:04.411\na that information can give you clues as\nto how you could perhaps prevented it or\n\n325\n00:18:04.411 --> 00:18:06.362\nwhat you can do moving forward.\n\n326\n00:18:06.362 --> 00:18:10.442\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the big things we\ntalked about that is the APT, Advanced,\n\n327\n00:18:10.442 --> 00:18:13.502\nPersistent Treats and\nwhat we're seeing from a lot of\n\n328\n00:18:13.502 --> 00:18:17.922\norganization is that Most of these\norganizations, when they find a breach,\n\n329\n00:18:17.922 --> 00:18:21.440\nthey realize that it didn't\njust occur yesterday.\n\n330\n00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.740\nIt's been weeks or\nmonths that they've been infiltrated.\n\n331\n00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.010\nThe breach actually occurred ten months\nago, and I was reading one article,\n\n332\n00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.560\nthey were saying on average it's like ten\nmonths before they detect the breach.\n\n333\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.360\n&gt;&gt; That's scary.\n\n334\n00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.032\n&gt;&gt; Isn't it though?\n\n335\n00:18:35.032 --> 00:18:36.839\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that means the bad guys running\n\n336\n00:18:36.839 --> 00:18:40.260\naround in your network for almost\na year before you realize he's there.\n\n337\n00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.739\n&gt;&gt; He's not on vacation now.\n\n338\n00:18:42.739 --> 00:18:43.904\n[LAUGH] Good luck.\n\n339\n00:18:43.904 --> 00:18:47.750\n&gt;&gt; That's really,\nreally scary cuz how do you go back.\n\n340\n00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.896\nDo you have backups from ten years ago?\n\n341\n00:18:49.896 --> 00:18:52.970\nAnd most likely they're not stealing data.\n\n342\n00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.530\nI shouldn't,\nnot that they are stealing data,\n\n343\n00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:59.190\nmost likely they're not\ndoing harmful things like,\n\n344\n00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:04.936\nDDOS attacks or things like that\nbecause that would draw attention.\n\n345\n00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:05.436\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n346\n00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:06.545\nSo if they're staying low key and\n\n347\n00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:07.296\ngetting away with it,\n\n348\n00:19:07.296 --> 00:19:08.663\nthen why cause attention to yourself.\nRight?\n\n349\n00:19:08.663 --> 00:19:10.751\n&gt;&gt; They're just sitting there scraping\n\n350\n00:19:10.751 --> 00:19:13.830\ncredentials, looking for new avenues.\n&gt;&gt; Like taking candy\n\n351\n00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.440\nfrom a baby.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n352\n00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.530\nJust sitting there watching things happen,\n\n353\n00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.650\nlearning all the different\nconnections in your network.\n\n354\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:23.570\nThey're making sure that they can get\nback in, and they're just stealing data\n\n355\n00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.670\nleft and right, over and over,\njust cuz you don't know they're there.\n\n356\n00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.290\nAnd this is where you're going\nback to what you're saying,\n\n357\n00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:33.300\nlooking at that historical data can help\ntry to figure out when the actual breech\n\n358\n00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.760\noccurred.\n\n359\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.880\nSo that we can try to figure\nout where we're wrong, and\n\n360\n00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.540\nhow we can go about fixing that.\n\n361\n00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.710\nWhat else?\nSo we talked about event logs in a Windows\n\n362\n00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:49.350\nsystem, as far as the authentication logs\ngo that's the security log, which, and\n\n363\n00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.610\nWindows nowadays,\nin 2008 and later I think,\n\n364\n00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:56.219\nauthentication or logon events are-\n&gt;&gt; Audit logs.\n\n365\n00:19:56.219 --> 00:19:57.820\n&gt;&gt; Audited by default.\n\n366\n00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:02.290\nThey're actually turned on, it used to be\nnot the case, even on your client systems,\n\n367\n00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.920\nbut those all go into the security log.\n\n368\n00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.430\nRemember, there's three main event logs\nin Windows, you get your application,\n\n369\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:12.010\nsecurity system, and the security\nlog is where you gonna wanna go and\n\n370\n00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.945\nlook for authentication events.\n\n371\n00:20:15.945 --> 00:20:21.160\nIn Linux it's\n\n372\n00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:26.390\ngosh warlogs, slash war slash logs off\n\n373\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.440\nthat I think it's AUTH is the name of the\nfile there that's you're gonna look for.\n\n374\n00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.890\nThere should have in fact I\ncould show let's see I think I\n\n375\n00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:38.635\ngot my Linux box still open, I was\nplaying around a few of these commands.\n\n376\n00:20:38.635 --> 00:20:39.865\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen,\n\n377\n00:20:39.865 --> 00:20:42.825\nwe haven't done anything fun in days.\n\n378\n00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:47.615\nNot that what we have been doing isn't\nfun, but I shouldn't say it that way.\n\n379\n00:20:47.615 --> 00:20:52.975\nLet's see if I can find a real quick\none when I was playing out there.\n\n380\n00:20:52.975 --> 00:20:58.005\nWe'll go into var log And\nthe one we're actually looking for\n\n381\n00:20:58.005 --> 00:21:02.850\nis off.log right there, that one's\ngonna have our authentication requests.\n\n382\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.070\nAnd see if we can see anything here,\n\n383\n00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.340\nit's different Linux\nsystems behave differently.\n\n384\n00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.150\nAnd it's a little bit trickier than\nworking with Windows, because it's\n\n385\n00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.890\ndifferent services log differently,\nnot everybody dumps their logs.\n\n386\n00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.010\nLike uSSL connection,\nthat might not log in this one,\n\n387\n00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.150\nit might have a separate log that\nyou're gonna have to go and check.\n\n388\n00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.760\nSo do make sure you do\nyour due diligence there,\n\n389\n00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.440\nbut you can see these are just\nlogon events that have occurred.\n\n390\n00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.260\nSession opened for user root, uid-0,\n\n391\n00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.170\ndate and time information there,\nso that's one place you can look,\n\n392\n00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:41.200\nyou can also do a command, last, which\nshows you the last few logon attempts.\n\n393\n00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.690\nAnd there,\nyou can see I'm a very secure Linux user,\n\n394\n00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.215\nbecause I have an account called Root.\n\n395\n00:21:46.215 --> 00:21:48.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the password is root.\n\n396\n00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:53.050\nNo, I'm just kidding, it's Tor,\n[LAUGH] no, this is a local machine,\n\n397\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.550\nso it's okay, I blow this thing\naways just about every other day.\n\n398\n00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:00.290\nBut you can see that where\nI've logged in with root, so\n\n399\n00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.940\njust another place we can go and check.\n\n400\n00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.240\nThere's also one called, what is it?\n\n401\n00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:11.570\nIt's LastB which is supposed to\nshow you the failed logon attempts,\n\n402\n00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.090\nlastB, bad logons, right?\n\n403\n00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.580\nLast shows you the successful\nlogon attempts,\n\n404\n00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.960\nLastB should show you\nthe unsuccessful ones.\n\n405\n00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.970\nAnd I would tell you,\nI've not gotten that to work the way it\n\n406\n00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.680\nshould because I've typed in\nthe wrong password and had it go.\n\n407\n00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.930\nAnd I know that's me not being the Lenux\nguru and I could be looking in the wrong\n\n408\n00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.270\nlog file, but supposedly that's what\nthat's for, but good commands to know.\n\n409\n00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:38.460\nLast is gonna show you your\nlast few successful log ons,\n\n410\n00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.969\nLasby should show you your\nlast unsuccessful log ons.\n\n411\n00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.790\nWhat else?\n\n412\n00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:49.116\nThere's actually another [INAUDIBLE] here,\n\n413\n00:22:49.116 --> 00:22:53.904\nlast login was another one,\nno, that's not it.\n\n414\n00:22:57.772 --> 00:22:59.490\nMaybe that was all I was\ngonna show you there.\n\n415\n00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:05.070\nLast last, and The .log, yeah, okay.\n\n416\n00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.617\nSo that's where you might find some of\nthat information in your Lynsx systems.\n\n417\n00:23:08.617 --> 00:23:09.450\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n418\n00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.150\nNow, next thing I wanna talk about is\nsomething known as defense in depth and\n\n419\n00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.350\nI know that we've harped on this with\n\n420\n00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.310\nit [INAUDIBLE] I'm getting\nthe we're almost out of time.\n\n421\n00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.177\nIn defense and depth,\nwe've got a lot of things to talk about.\n\n422\n00:23:21.177 --> 00:23:23.776\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nIt's such an integral part of security\n\n423\n00:23:23.776 --> 00:23:27.230\nthat, I don't know if we can,\nwe can start talking about it.\n\n424\n00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.240\n&gt;&gt; We'll define the concepts,\neven though we should know that already,\n\n425\n00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.320\nwe'll define it, and then we'll come back,\nand we'll do another episode.\n\n426\n00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.870\nWe will go through all\nthe different techniques that Comfy\n\n427\n00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:37.620\ncalls out in this exam.\n\n428\n00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.380\n&gt;&gt; Something to plan.\n&gt;&gt; Comes to defense in depth.\n\n429\n00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.820\nSo defense in depth also you could\nrefer to this a security in layers or\n\n430\n00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.480\nlayered security approach.\n\n431\n00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.350\nWe just wanna make sure that we\nare using multiple layers of defense.\n\n432\n00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.170\nRight, in other words, I don't wanna put,\n\n433\n00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.100\nwe've been doing this the last few\nepisodes, use those old sayings.\n\n434\n00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.320\nDon't put all your eggs in one basket, and\n\n435\n00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:02.270\nit was something that we used to do a long\ntime ago, it was a common practice.\n\n436\n00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:07.230\nLike we would put a firewall at the border\nof our network, and then we didn't have\n\n437\n00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:10.190\nto worry about anything inside it because\nyou can't get passed my firewall.\n\n438\n00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:13.500\nSo everything inside it is protected,\nit's in this little island.\n\n439\n00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.392\nWe got a mote dug around it,\nwe're all good to go.\n\n440\n00:24:15.392 --> 00:24:18.487\n&gt;&gt; Because all of my employees are sweet\nand they love working for my company.\n\n441\n00:24:18.487 --> 00:24:21.530\nAnd they would never do\nanything to harm my company.\n\n442\n00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.290\n&gt;&gt; Never, you know we didn't\nthink about insiders doing bad\n\n443\n00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:26.870\nthings because they were,\nthey were all sweet.\n\n444\n00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:31.150\nThe other things is once that firewall\nwas compromised, you had free run of\n\n445\n00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:35.720\nthe network cuz there was nothing else\nleft in there to stop you from bouncing\n\n446\n00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.330\nfrom one machine to the next machine,\nand just going to turn, all right?\n\n447\n00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.908\nIt's like a fox in a hen house, so\nonce it gets in, it's all over.\n\n448\n00:24:42.908 --> 00:24:47.960\nSo defense in-depth is providing\nmultiple layers of security every single\n\n449\n00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.330\nstep of the way, from physical\nsecurity to logical security.\n\n450\n00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.650\nSo we'll talk about a few different\nconcepts there when it comes to\n\n451\n00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:59.920\ndefense in-depth in our upcoming episode.\n\n452\n00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.200\nSound great, Mike, but\nI do think we're out of time for\n\n453\n00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.360\nthis particular episode, so I'm going\nto go ahead and sign off as your host.\n\n454\n00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.460\nMy name is Cherokee Boose\n&gt;&gt; and I'm Mike Rodrick\n\n455\n00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.721\n&gt;&gt; See you next time at IT Pro TV\n\n456\n00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:17.851\n[MUSIC]\n\n457\n00:25:17.851 --> 00:25:20.486\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Live from San Francisco [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:08.286\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:11.887\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:15.920\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your CompTIA Cyber\nSecurity Analyst Plus Series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.000\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.100\nIf you've been following along,\nyou'll know that this is a continuation.\n\n9\n00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.060\nIn the previous episode,\nwe were talking a lot about logs and\n\n10\n00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.610\ndifferent types of analysis\nstrategies to help your environment.\n\n11\n00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.010\nAnd we're gonna continue looking at\ndifferent types of security architecture.\n\n12\n00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.380\nWe left off talking about\na really big topic,\n\n13\n00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.730\nit's something called defense in-depth.\n\n14\n00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.350\nAnd, well, if you've ever seen Shrek,\n\n15\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.520\nthen you know exactly what\nwe're talking about, right?\n\n16\n00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.230\nHave you seen Shrek before Mike?\n\n17\n00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.990\n&gt;&gt; I have, but I'm dying to know\nhow you're gonna tie that in\n\n18\n00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.080\nto defense in-depth because\nI missed that part.\n\n19\n00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.290\n&gt;&gt; Do you remember what ogres are like?\n\n20\n00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.849\nOgres are like onions,\nthey have many layers.\n\n21\n00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:54.654\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n22\n00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:55.380\n&gt;&gt; Good one, I like that.\n\n23\n00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that, all right.\n\n24\n00:00:56.907 --> 00:00:57.790\n&gt;&gt; I love that saying.\n\n25\n00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n26\n00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.130\neverything you would need to know about\nsecurity, you can learn from Shrek.\n\n27\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.057\n&gt;&gt; Perfect-\n&gt;&gt; Just kidding,\n\n28\n00:01:03.057 --> 00:01:04.396\nthat's why we have Mike here today.\n\n29\n00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:05.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So thank you for\n\n30\n00:01:05.492 --> 00:01:06.323\njoining us today, Mike.\n\n31\n00:01:06.323 --> 00:01:07.854\n[LAUGH] What are we gonna be looking at?\n\n32\n00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:09.996\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think of my best ogre\nimitation, and I just don't have it.\n\n33\n00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:10.634\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:11.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.750\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna be looking\nat defense in depth though.\n\n36\n00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.150\nAnd I do like that analogy,\nthe whole onion thing.\n\n37\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.570\nYou peel back one layer and there's\nanother layer there, waiting for you.\n\n38\n00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.790\nYou peel back that layer, and\nthere's another layer waiting for you.\n\n39\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.480\nAnd that's really what defense in depth is\nall about, is having layers of security,\n\n40\n00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.350\nand we do that for\na couple of reasons, right?\n\n41\n00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.373\nThe first and foremost is because, I don't\nwanna rely on any one technology, or\n\n42\n00:01:34.373 --> 00:01:37.466\nlayer if you will,\nof security to protect my entire network.\n\n43\n00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:40.560\nBecause all they have to do is\nfind one vulnerability, and\n\n44\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.450\nthey get through that one layer and\nthey're in.\n\n45\n00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.060\nAnd that's not gonna make a good day for\nmy organization.\n\n46\n00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.810\nSo we want multiple layers just to slow\nthem down, to make it more difficult.\n\n47\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.038\nSomebody might be really good at\ngetting through firewalls, right?\n\n48\n00:01:54.038 --> 00:01:55.240\nBut once they get passed that,\n\n49\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.740\nthey're not as good as getting pass\nby intrusion detection system.\n\n50\n00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.220\nThey don't have the techniques for that.\n\n51\n00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.740\nOnce they get past that,\n\n52\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.510\nthey don't have a good way to\nget across network segmentation.\n\n53\n00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.130\nThey don't have a good way\nto breach that yet, or\n\n54\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.660\nmaybe they're not as skilled\nin that particular area.\n\n55\n00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.880\nAnd I'm just throwing out random examples,\nbut you get the idea, right?\n\n56\n00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.800\nThat by having more and more layers to it,\nit makes it a much more complex attack and\n\n57\n00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.910\nthey've gotta have more skills\nto make it all the way through.\n\n58\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.410\nAnd so\nthat's a big part of defense in depth.\n\n59\n00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.440\nThe other big reason we would\ndo defense in depth is because\n\n60\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.410\nhopefully it's gonna create more noise.\n\n61\n00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.010\nIt's more chances,\n\n62\n00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.060\nwe increase the number of opportunities\nthat we have to detect the attack, right?\n\n63\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.110\nHopefully I see that attack\non my firewall, right?\n\n64\n00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.540\nI'm looking at my log\nfiles on a daily basis.\n\n65\n00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.170\nI've automated the process,\nwhere we're looking for keywords or\n\n66\n00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.760\ncertain strings in those\nlogs on an hourly basis.\n\n67\n00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.010\nSo we're gonna see that.\n\n68\n00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.590\nAnd if we happen to miss that, that next\nlayer of defense, we can maybe we'll pick\n\n69\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.240\nup, maybe it'll set off our IDS and\nwe'll pick up an alarm there.\n\n70\n00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.250\nSo each one of those layers, they have to\nbreak through, hopefully we're monitoring\n\n71\n00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.920\nevery single one of those layers and\nwe're gonna him at one point, right?\n\n72\n00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.630\nThey're breaking into our building,\nI'm hoping that the fence stops them or\n\n73\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.890\nthat my guards pick them up\nas they make their rounds.\n\n74\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.980\nIf that doesn't work, they get to\nthe doorway, we've got cameras,\n\n75\n00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.840\nwe've got lights.\n\n76\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.060\nIf that doesn't work,\nI've got locks on the door.\n\n77\n00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.970\nIf that doesn't work they get\nthrough the first door and\n\n78\n00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.680\nthey realize it's a man trap and\nhow am I gonna get out of that, right?\n\n79\n00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.460\nLayers of defense the entire way.\n\n80\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.900\n&gt;&gt; Mike, that is so important because\nthere's not just one thing we can do like\n\n81\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.470\nflip a switch and\nsay my network is secure now, right?\n\n82\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.991\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you got a grenade you just\ntake out your entire network down.\n\n83\n00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:43.591\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n84\n00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:45.123\n[LAUGH].\n\n85\n00:03:45.123 --> 00:03:48.997\n&gt;&gt; I forget where I saw this statistic,\nbut I found it to be interesting,\n\n86\n00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:51.758\nbecause like you said\nproviding that variation or\n\n87\n00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:56.357\nthat good mix within your environment\nbecause if 90% of attackers are newbies or\n\n88\n00:03:56.357 --> 00:03:59.930\nscript kitties, they don't have\nthat higher level skill set.\n\n89\n00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.190\n9% may be for higher and then you\nhave that 1% that falls into that-\n\n90\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.270\n&gt;&gt; Elite status.\n\n91\n00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.620\n&gt;&gt; Cyber terrorists, yeah.\n\n92\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.830\nSo by adding all these extra\nlittle things you're just kind\n\n93\n00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.200\nof upping the anti there\nto protect yourself.\n\n94\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.351\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I can't say it enough.\n\n95\n00:04:15.351 --> 00:04:19.300\nYou have to put protection at\nevery single step of the way.\n\n96\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.867\nSo when we talk about defense in depth as\nfar as this exam goes, let's talk about\n\n97\n00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:29.693\nsome of the things that they specifically\ncall out to help provide defense in depth.\n\n98\n00:04:29.693 --> 00:04:33.794\nAnd this is by no means an all inclusive\nlist, but it is again what they call out,\n\n99\n00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:37.180\nso some concepts that I wanna\nmake sure we're comfortable with.\n\n100\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.677\nAnd one of them, and\nI've actually added one to this so\n\n101\n00:04:39.677 --> 00:04:42.626\nit wasn't on the exam objectives,\nI just threw it in there.\n\n102\n00:04:42.626 --> 00:04:43.271\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:45.000\n&gt;&gt; As a little bonus.\n\n104\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.798\nDual control, split knowledge, and\nseparation of duties are three\n\n105\n00:04:49.798 --> 00:04:53.780\nthat are very,\nvery similar in concept and what they do.\n\n106\n00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.320\nSplit knowledge I actually\ndon't think was on that.\n\n107\n00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.900\nI didn't remember which one was on.\n\n108\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.560\nI know dual control was on there and\nseparation of duties,\n\n109\n00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.742\nsplit knowledge is the one\nthat I added to this.\n\n110\n00:05:03.742 --> 00:05:04.448\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n111\n00:05:04.448 --> 00:05:07.880\n&gt;&gt; Because it is one when you start\nout doing research on dual control.\n\n112\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.310\nYou'll see a lot of papers on dual\ncontrol versus split knowledge,\n\n113\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.690\nwhich one's better.\n\n114\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.080\nThey're very similar.\n\n115\n00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.880\nI get these confused.\n\n116\n00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.450\nWhat's the difference between them?\n\n117\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.765\n&gt;&gt; So things like the m of n control\nwhere I'm saying 50% of my IT\n\n118\n00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:26.920\nstaff have to be present before I can\nperform this backup restoration or\n\n119\n00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.070\nthings like if I'm using\nan escrow service.\n\n120\n00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.645\nWould you categorize those concepts\nin this particular section here?\n\n121\n00:05:32.645 --> 00:05:34.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes and\nI would put that under dual control.\n\n122\n00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.000\nWhen we talk about dual control,\nwe're almost always talking about,\n\n123\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.770\nsome type of physical activity that has\nto be done by more than one person.\n\n124\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.645\nWe think of the old movies with the\nmissile silos, and they had the launchers.\n\n125\n00:05:47.645 --> 00:05:48.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And you had the two\n\n126\n00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.120\nkeys that had to be put in and turned.\n\n127\n00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.490\n&gt;&gt; Key distribution, there you go.\n\n128\n00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n129\n00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.760\nAnd that the keys were too far apart for\none person to try to put them both in and\n\n130\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.700\nturn them at the same time, but they\nhad to be inserted at the same time and\n\n131\n00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.790\nturned at the same time.\n\n132\n00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.429\n&gt;&gt; So Mike couldn't just go crazy and\nnuke the whole place, right?\n\n133\n00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:06.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly it keeps us safe from Cherokee\n\n134\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.840\nand her desire to make glass everywhere.\n\n135\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.580\nSo dual control, we see that.\n\n136\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.840\nWe might see this in highly secure\nareas where we have biometrics.\n\n137\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.991\n&gt;&gt; You might have a door that's,\nI don't know, three,\n\n138\n00:06:19.991 --> 00:06:22.399\nfour feet wide door, an extra wide door.\n\n139\n00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:25.708\nAnd on either side of them is\nsome type of biometric reader.\n\n140\n00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:27.190\nAnd you've gotta have two people,\n\n141\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.060\nthere are several people that\nare authorized maybe to get in, but\n\n142\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.190\nyou need two biometric scans at the same\ntime in order to enter the room.\n\n143\n00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.065\nAnd there's no way that one person,\nif you put the meters far enough,\n\n144\n00:06:37.065 --> 00:06:38.786\ncan't put their fingers on both of them.\n\n145\n00:06:38.786 --> 00:06:42.231\nOr if it's an iris scan, it'd be really\nhard to look at both cameras at the same\n\n146\n00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:43.550\ntime or something like that.\n\n147\n00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.760\nBut the idea behind the dual\ncontrol typically is two or\n\n148\n00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.950\nmore people having performed some\nphysical activity simultaneously versus\n\n149\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:57.300\nsplit knowledge is not a physical thing,\nit's more of a logical thing.\n\n150\n00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.500\nYou might have a password\nto get into a system, but\n\n151\n00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.120\nthe password is split in two parts.\n\n152\n00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.040\nCherokee knows part of the password,\nI know part of the password.\n\n153\n00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.570\nBoth parts have to be entered\nto gain access to this system.\n\n154\n00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.180\nI can't do it on my own cuz I\nonly know part of the password.\n\n155\n00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.662\nCherokee only knows part of the password.\n\n156\n00:07:12.662 --> 00:07:14.179\n&gt;&gt; Going back to those launch codes.\n\n157\n00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:16.106\n&gt;&gt; Yes, in fact, it's the same thing.\n\n158\n00:07:16.106 --> 00:07:19.280\nThe launch codes were in fact\na split knowledge thing.\n\n159\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.766\nThe missile silo operators typically\nhad their own boxes that locked their\n\n160\n00:07:22.766 --> 00:07:23.325\nown codes.\n\n161\n00:07:23.325 --> 00:07:25.830\nThey had separate keys to their own box.\n\n162\n00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.760\nThey pull out their codes.\n\n163\n00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.080\nThey had both had to put the codes in.\n\n164\n00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.940\nAnd then they had the dual controls where\nthey both had to put the keys in and\n\n165\n00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.080\nturn them.\n\n166\n00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.720\nSo same concept, there you're\nseeing both split knowledge and\n\n167\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.340\ndual controls in that type of scenario.\n\n168\n00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.050\nSo just understand the difference there.\n\n169\n00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:45.198\nDual controls typically some type of\nphysical activity whereas split knowledge\n\n170\n00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:49.887\nis usually more of a logical thing where\nI might know part of a password, or\n\n171\n00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:52.322\npart of a key or part of a combination.\n\n172\n00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:56.571\nBut somebody else knows the other part and\nwe have to be together, work together,\n\n173\n00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:58.184\nit's like on the Enterprise.\n\n174\n00:07:58.184 --> 00:08:01.304\nYou couldn't have just one person\nentering in the self destruct code,\n\n175\n00:08:01.304 --> 00:08:02.921\nyou have to have for the one officer.\n\n176\n00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:04.408\nEntering in that self destruct code.\n\n177\n00:08:04.408 --> 00:08:05.669\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike,\n\n178\n00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:07.403\nyou mentioned separation of duties.\n\n179\n00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:11.474\nAnd so I've worked with people in the past\nthat just wanted all the power to\n\n180\n00:08:11.474 --> 00:08:12.140\nthemself.\n\n181\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.910\nAnd I know that that sounds crazy, but\nI'm sure you guys have too, you know it.\n\n182\n00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.670\nThat's that one person,\nthat's like their job security, right?\n\n183\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.900\nSo what can we do to prevent\nthat from happening, Mike?\n\n184\n00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.980\n&gt;&gt; It's tough because especially in\nsmaller shops where you've got somebody\n\n185\n00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.480\nwho's been running the network for, say,\nshe's running the network for 15 years.\n\n186\n00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.620\nShe knows everything about the network.\n\n187\n00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:36.620\nAnd if she ever wasn't here anymore,\nGod forbid, we'd be in trouble.\n\n188\n00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.780\nSeparation of duties is really\nabout splitting business functions\n\n189\n00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.930\nto different users, so\nthat one person can't do all of the jobs.\n\n190\n00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:50.650\nAnd we'll come back to that concept of\na one person knowing everything but\n\n191\n00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.748\nreally that is what\nseparation duties are about.\n\n192\n00:08:53.748 --> 00:08:58.498\nBecause for example, the examples we\nusually see when your researching this is\n\n193\n00:08:58.498 --> 00:09:02.980\nlike a loan officer\nthat is responsible for\n\n194\n00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:09.390\napproving loans is not the same one that's\nresponsible for receiving payments,\n\n195\n00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.260\nor something like that.\n\n196\n00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.510\nOr, what's another one?\n\n197\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:16.720\nThe person that's issuing the credit\ncards does not also issue the PINs,\n\n198\n00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.620\nbecause they would know both parts, right?\n\n199\n00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.740\nThey would have the credit card and\nthe PIN number.\n\n200\n00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:25.180\nAnd if it takes more than one person,\nit's what we call collusion.\n\n201\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.600\nAnd it's a lot less likely that\nyou're gonna have two people willing\n\n202\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.640\nto perform this malicious activity.\n\n203\n00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.921\nCherokee might get mad, and\nshe says, you know, this company-\n\n204\n00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:36.609\n&gt;&gt; A, that is not me.\n\n205\n00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:39.566\nAnd B, I do not even hang out\nwith people like that, all right?\n\n206\n00:09:39.566 --> 00:09:41.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I tell you, she gets mad,\n\n207\n00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.170\nshe's got her favorite parking spot.\n\n208\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.650\nAnd if somebody's parked there,\nit really irks her.\n\n209\n00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.510\nI mean, she comes in just all steaming.\n\n210\n00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.760\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n211\n00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.370\nI forgot even where I was going with that.\n\n212\n00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.440\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwhat about things like cross training or\n\n213\n00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.370\nmandatory vacations,\nthat could help in some aspects, right?\n\n214\n00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.704\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely but let me finish\nmy thought on separation of duties,\n\n215\n00:10:00.704 --> 00:10:05.170\nwhen we talk about,\nin the IT world, if one\n\n216\n00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:10.140\nperson can do all steps in a process,\nthat can become a problem.\n\n217\n00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.400\nIf I make it to where this person can do\none step, this person can do one step and\n\n218\n00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.160\nthe third person can do that third step,\n\n219\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.860\nif they want to do any\nmalicious behavior or\n\n220\n00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.210\nmalicious activity, all three of them have\nto work in collusion to make that occur.\n\n221\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.590\nAnd the odds are much more likely-\n&gt;&gt; It's a fancy word.\n\n222\n00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that word,\ncollusion, working together, right.\n\n223\n00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.798\nThe odds are less that you're\ngonna get that type of effort.\n\n224\n00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:33.590\nWe're always gonna have, that's where I\nwas going with Cherokee and all steamy and\n\n225\n00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.040\nmad, which she really never is.\n\n226\n00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.180\nShe's such a nice person.\n\n227\n00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:41.030\nBut it's likely that you'll have an\nemployee that's disgruntled, or angry, or\n\n228\n00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.230\nwants to take revenge, or\nis mad about something.\n\n229\n00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.630\nBut does he have somebody else\nthat's at that same level\n\n230\n00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.310\nthat wants to participate and\ndo something against the organization?\n\n231\n00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.970\nSo by separating out duties,\n\n232\n00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:57.710\nwe can hopefully prevent that type\nof activity or at least limit it.\n\n233\n00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.990\nNow we get back in what we're\ntalking about with Cherokee there,\n\n234\n00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.440\nwhat you brought up.\n\n235\n00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.740\nUsing third parties or consultants is\nanother way to provide defensive depth.\n\n236\n00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.640\nAnd it's like, well, wait,\nhow is that providing?\n\n237\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.720\nBecause if we get outside\neyes looking on something,\n\n238\n00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.620\nthey might notice things that we don't,\nwe're used to seeing it every day.\n\n239\n00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.880\nSo doing audits from\nthird parties gets you\n\n240\n00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.730\na better perspective on what\nyou're doing typically.\n\n241\n00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:28.640\nOr it takes part of the job out\nof our hands, so that again,\n\n242\n00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.430\nit's kind of like doing\nseparation of duties.\n\n243\n00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.590\nWe can do step one and two, but that\nthird party's responsible for step three.\n\n244\n00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.540\nWe can't do it without them.\n\n245\n00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.920\nSo I couldn't perform\nthe activity on my own.\n\n246\n00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.860\nSo again,\nit's kind of like separation of duty.\n\n247\n00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.410\n&gt;&gt; But that might add another layer\nof complexity of security there,\n\n248\n00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.810\nbecause you always have to trust them.\n\n249\n00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.540\nAnd like we were talking about yesterday,\n\n250\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.590\nwhen you're hiring those third party\nconsultants and things like that,\n\n251\n00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.120\nyou wanna make sure they\nhave a good reputation.\n\n252\n00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.830\nBecause you can somewhat\ncontrol your environment.\n\n253\n00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.240\nWho you're hiring,\nwho's working on your systems.\n\n254\n00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.360\nBut you really don't have that\ncontrol outside of your environment.\n\n255\n00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.192\n&gt;&gt; No,\nyou have to ask the right questions.\n\n256\n00:12:01.192 --> 00:12:04.910\nYou cannot be shy about asking questions\nany time you're talking about hiring\n\n257\n00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.220\na third party to do something.\n\n258\n00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.790\n&gt;&gt; Having them sign NDAs and\nthings like that.\n\n259\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.330\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and hey,\nwhere's your audit results?.\n\n260\n00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.610\nWhen's the last time you got audited?\n\n261\n00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.650\nLet me see your results,\nlet me make sure that you're certified.\n\n262\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.699\nHey, we're HIPAA compliant-\n&gt;&gt; Worthy of my business.\n\n263\n00:12:16.699 --> 00:12:17.709\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right,\n\n264\n00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:19.971\nwe're in a business were we\nhave to be HIPAA compliant.\n\n265\n00:12:19.971 --> 00:12:23.105\nIf you're gonna do business with us, if\nyou're gonna connect your network to ours\n\n266\n00:12:23.105 --> 00:12:25.760\nfor any reason, you now have\nto be HIPAA compliant as well.\n\n267\n00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.400\nAnd again you have to double check\nthe laws on that depending on what they're\n\n268\n00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.500\ngetting, they might or might not.\n\n269\n00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.570\nI'm not saying they have to, but the idea\nis that yes, that's my responsibility.\n\n270\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.610\nI am going to, I mean, not responsible for\nmaking them HIPAA compliant.\n\n271\n00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.130\nBut I am responsible for\n\n272\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.940\nmaking sure that the third\nparties that I do hire do follow.\n\n273\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.390\nIf they don't, I'm not gonna fix them,\nI'll just move somebody else that is.\n\n274\n00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.300\nBut is definitely part of my\ndue diligence that I have to do\n\n275\n00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.560\nto make sure that the third\nparties that we're bringing in\n\n276\n00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.070\nare behold to the same level\nof standards that we do.\n\n277\n00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.380\nIf you hang out with these,\nI'm trying to think\n\n278\n00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.440\nof some cool little saying here but,\nyeah, I'm out of old sayings.\n\n279\n00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.170\nBut yeah, you can definitely\nbring your security down or\n\n280\n00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.630\ncause a breach by not\ndoing due diligence there.\n\n281\n00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:17.830\n&gt;&gt; And in the United States, it's weird\nbecause we don't have as many protections.\n\n282\n00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.610\nIf you look at in Europe and\nthe European Union, they have laws and\n\n283\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.510\nregulations to protect\ndata in that manner.\n\n284\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.425\nBut here, I would have to probably\ngo through some kind of civil\n\n285\n00:13:28.425 --> 00:13:32.910\nlitigation if a third\nparty contractor's system\n\n286\n00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.730\nhad been breached and\nreleased my customers' information.\n\n287\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:37.510\nBut here's the thing.\n\n288\n00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.100\nYou go after them and you go to sue them,\nbut that point of time you may have\n\n289\n00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.850\nalready lost your company's reputation,\nyour customers are going elsewhere.\n\n290\n00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:50.158\nIt's still a bad situation for you to\nbe in, so that's why it's so important.\n\n291\n00:13:50.158 --> 00:13:54.920\n&gt;&gt; The European Union, over there, I think\nthey're a few years ahead of us in some of\n\n292\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.780\nthat as far as setting those\nregulations into place.\n\n293\n00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.770\nCross training, I think Cherokee,\nyou mentioned that one.\n\n294\n00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.210\nThat's another one we can\ndo with defense and depth.\n\n295\n00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.770\nYou might think, wait, doesn't that\ngo against separation of duties?\n\n296\n00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:13.320\nAnd it does a little bit, where you can\nkind of say from one point by training\n\n297\n00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.080\npeople in all these different places\nthat now they could do the entire job.\n\n298\n00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.899\nBut we might mix it up a little bit to\nwhere they don't learn everything in\n\n299\n00:14:22.899 --> 00:14:28.113\na process, or even though we're cross\ntraining, like I might know my step and\n\n300\n00:14:28.113 --> 00:14:31.764\nI also might know Cherokee's\nstep if she's ever out.\n\n301\n00:14:31.764 --> 00:14:34.040\nBut I'm never going to be doing both\nof them at the same time anyway.\n\n302\n00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.800\nNormally I'm here and Cherokee's here.\n\n303\n00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.230\nIf Cherokee's not here, maybe I'm\ncross trained, I slip over there but\n\n304\n00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.050\nsomebody else goes into my position.\n\n305\n00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.070\nSo it's not like I'm doing\nthe whole process still.\n\n306\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.333\nSo even though we want separation of duty,\nwe can still do cross training.\n\n307\n00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:50.818\nCross training is incredibly important\nwhen it comes to maintaining a business,\n\n308\n00:14:50.818 --> 00:14:53.925\nbusiness continuity plans, things happen.\n\n309\n00:14:53.925 --> 00:14:57.748\nWe hate to think about it, but what\nhappens if that person doesn't make it in\n\n310\n00:14:57.748 --> 00:15:01.390\nthe next day, or is not gonna make it\nagain, just leaves the company, or\n\n311\n00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.470\nGod forbid,\nsomething physically happened to them.\n\n312\n00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.240\nDo we have anybody that\nknows what they did and\n\n313\n00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.040\nwhat their passwords were\nto get into that system?\n\n314\n00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.010\nOr what that process is that\nhappens every morning, magically.\n\n315\n00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.760\nI get these reports on my desk, but I\nhave no idea how they're being generated.\n\n316\n00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.860\nIs anybody else trained in that?\n\n317\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.782\n&gt;&gt; The report fairy, of course.\n\n318\n00:15:19.782 --> 00:15:21.551\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just left the old report\n\n319\n00:15:21.551 --> 00:15:25.600\nunder my pillow, and\nthe next day I get new reports, exactly.\n\n320\n00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.028\nSo making sure that people\nare cross training, and\n\n321\n00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:30.550\ncross training does a lot for\nmorale as well.\n\n322\n00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.480\nIt makes people feel-\n&gt;&gt; Challenged?\n\n323\n00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.930\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you get in a rut where you're\ndoing the same thing every day and\n\n324\n00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.300\nit gets boring.\n\n325\n00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.470\nAnd then you don't do your\njob as efficiently or\n\n326\n00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.230\nas effectively, right, because you're\njust kind of going through the motions.\n\n327\n00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.170\nBy cross training, it keeps people\nexcited, it keeps them on their toes.\n\n328\n00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.990\n&gt;&gt; Especially people who\nare interested in IT,\n\n329\n00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:53.250\nbecause usually those types of people\nhave a propensity to enjoy learning,\n\n330\n00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:57.150\nso they're learning a new system and\nkind of keeping that rotation.\n\n331\n00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.825\nI think that main idea is what, just to\nkeep someone from having sole control or\n\n332\n00:16:00.825 --> 00:16:01.946\npower and having that.\n\n333\n00:16:01.946 --> 00:16:04.727\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and like I said, and being able\nto continue on if something happens to\n\n334\n00:16:04.727 --> 00:16:06.241\nthe person that normally does that job.\n\n335\n00:16:06.241 --> 00:16:09.702\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n336\n00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:11.761\nIt also, as far as security goes,\n\n337\n00:16:11.761 --> 00:16:16.802\ninteresting thing is that it can improve\nsecurity because by doing cross training,\n\n338\n00:16:16.802 --> 00:16:21.559\nif Cherokee's been doing something for\nthe last five years, she could be doing\n\n339\n00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:25.924\nthings that maybe shouldn't be done-\n&gt;&gt; But how did you know?\n\n340\n00:16:25.924 --> 00:16:26.449\n&gt;&gt; But nobody's gonna know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n341\n00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:27.539\n&gt;&gt; Because nobody else is\n\n342\n00:16:27.539 --> 00:16:30.365\nin that position, right?\nShe's the only one that does it.\n\n343\n00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:31.520\nNobody's checking up on her.\n\n344\n00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.190\nShould we start cross training and\nrotating positions?\n\n345\n00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.278\nI come in, and I'm starting to do it and\nI'm like, hey, boss,\n\n346\n00:16:37.278 --> 00:16:38.720\nwhy does this look like this?\n\n347\n00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.610\nAnd he's going, I don't know,\nthat was back when Cherokee,\n\n348\n00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:42.630\nand that kind of thing.\n\n349\n00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.730\nIt gives us a chance to\nkind of look at things and\n\n350\n00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:51.980\nget out of that norm, that status quo,\nor the same old, same old, same old.\n\n351\n00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.960\nI think you also mentioned mandatory\nvacations which is another,\n\n352\n00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.290\nkind of the same lines, right?\n\n353\n00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.636\nYou think mandatory\nvacations that's great.\n\n354\n00:16:59.636 --> 00:17:03.765\nI wish my organization did that,\nforced me to go on vacation.\n\n355\n00:17:03.765 --> 00:17:07.860\n&gt;&gt; But if they forced me to go in vacation\nbecause they saw some foul behavior,\n\n356\n00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.837\nor foul play on my part, then maybe\nit's not sure a great thing, right?\n\n357\n00:17:11.837 --> 00:17:14.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right it's one of those\nthings where, yes, absolutely,\n\n358\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.710\nif you're like being\naccused of something and\n\n359\n00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:20.915\nthen all the sudden they say you need to\ngo on vacation, yeah you're in trouble.\n\n360\n00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:21.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n361\n00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:26.300\nmaking people take vacation once a year,\nis basically or\n\n362\n00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.550\nhow ever often they do this they say,\nlook we have mandatory vacation and\n\n363\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.260\neverybody knows that during your vacation\nthere's no investigation going on.\n\n364\n00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.410\nIt's just, hey, you've gotta take\na vacation sometime this year.\n\n365\n00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:40.210\nDuring that vacation somebody else\nis gonna be filling your seat.\n\n366\n00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:46.040\nSo there's, again, that chance to kind\nof put fresh eyes on the scenario and\n\n367\n00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.840\nnotice any discrepancies or\nstrange behaviors.\n\n368\n00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.930\nAlso gives IT a chance to go\nthrough your stuff [LAUGH].\n\n369\n00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.640\nTo actually analyze your stuff while\nyou're not there to see if you've been\n\n370\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.740\ndoing anything strange, so a couple of\ngood reason for doing mandatory vacations.\n\n371\n00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.110\nAlso, I had a third one in there.\n\n372\n00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.690\nIt's a deterrent.\n\n373\n00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.870\nWell, if you know that once a year\nyou're going to go on vacation and\n\n374\n00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.450\nduring that vacation they are going to\nbe putting somebody at your desk and\n\n375\n00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.620\nauditing everything that you've done,\ndoes that make you a little\n\n376\n00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.640\nbit more wary of doing something\nthat you shouldn't be doing?\n\n377\n00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.470\nBecause now you're like,\nokay they're going to catch me.\n\n378\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.040\nAs soon as I go on vacation,\nthey're going to analyze my stuff.\n\n379\n00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.400\nSo it's actually a deterrent as well.\n\n380\n00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.960\n&gt;&gt;

Yes.\nContinual improvement,\n\n410\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.760\nit is something that we\nshould always strive for.\n\n411\n00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.920\nIt's something that we do here,\n\n412\n00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.050\nin our organization, we are always trying\nto be better than we were the day before.\n\n413\n00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:56.530\nWe're always trying to improve, and if\nthat's something that I can give my users\n\n414\n00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.590\nas well as my software developer,\nI mean everybody, right,\n\n415\n00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.900\nshould always be within\nthe organization trying to be better.\n\n416\n00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.340\nWe wanna do scheduled reviews.\n\n417\n00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.190\nThis gives us, again,\na chance to sit people down,\n\n418\n00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:14.920\nask them questions, as well as talk\nabout the good that they've done.\n\n419\n00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.920\nHelps keep people motivated.\n\n420\n00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:22.040\nHelps keep people feel like they have\na vested interest in the organization and\n\n421\n00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.370\nits outcome, and\nwhy is that important to security?\n\n422\n00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.120\nBecause the disgruntled people.\n\n423\n00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.360\nThe ones that are not\nhappy with their job.\n\n424\n00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.040\nThe ones that are not happy\nwith the organization or\n\n425\n00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.410\nthe way they're being treated,\nthose are the easy marks for the bad guys.\n\n426\n00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.290\nRight?\nYou can go out on the way of you\n\n427\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:44.740\ncan actually find where bad guys\nare actively seeking insiders.\n\n428\n00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.830\nJob applications.\n\n429\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:55.100\nHey, looking for an insider at Company XYZ\nto help with data acquisition.\n\n430\n00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.610\nI kid you not, these are out there.\n\n431\n00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:00.360\nPeople, and that's a little extreme, but-\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a good point,\n\n432\n00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.960\nbecause people do become disgruntled.\n\n433\n00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.180\nEspecially if it's a company\nthat you've been for, you know,\n\n434\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.710\nbeen with the company for a long time,\n\n435\n00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.810\nso it is important to listen to your\nemployees and to treat them well.\n\n436\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.440\nAlso, I was, do you watch Ted talks?\n\n437\n00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.130\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, yep.\n\n438\n00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:12.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n439\n00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.250\nI was watching this Ted Talk today and\nI really apologize for\n\n440\n00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.790\nnot remembering this gentleman's name,\nI'm sure you guys could,\n\n441\n00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.230\nhe created some methodology I think\nit was called the golden circle, but\n\n442\n00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.270\ngoing back to like you said with\ncontinual improvement, Just having,\n\n443\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:31.400\nwhat I love here at ITProTV is the owner\nof our company will go ahead and\n\n444\n00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.540\ngive out the mission statements during\nstand up meetings in the morning.\n\n445\n00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.360\nTo just keep us grounded and remember why\nwe wanna do this, why we wanna reach and\n\n446\n00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.350\nhelp people and I think it's important\nto keep that concept in mind.\n\n447\n00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.880\nInstead of explaining a product that\nyou have and what makes that product so\n\n448\n00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.830\ngreat and then asking someone to buy it,\nlet them know what your mission is,\n\n449\n00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.490\nwhat you're doing, and\nthen tell them what's so great about it,\n\n450\n00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.275\nand then ask them whatever question.\n\n451\n00:21:55.275 --> 00:21:56.285\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely,\n\n452\n00:21:56.285 --> 00:22:00.725\nand a happy employee is\na hopefully a good safe employee.\n\n453\n00:22:00.725 --> 00:22:05.100\nBut yeah, you see the movies and\nyou see them where they found that guy\n\n454\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.970\nthat's down on his luck, and\nhe's got a gambling problem, and so\n\n455\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:13.980\nthey know if they offer him $50,000\nhe's going to willing to grab trash out\n\n456\n00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:19.640\nof all the other offices and hand it over\nand you know get his $50,000, or whatever.\n\n457\n00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.738\nBut you know all kidding aside,\nthat is the kind of thing that happens,\n\n458\n00:22:23.738 --> 00:22:28.128\nespecially when we're looking at\nthe value of the information, if it's-\n\n459\n00:22:28.128 --> 00:22:29.340\n&gt;&gt; Certainly.\n\n460\n00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:32.710\n&gt;&gt; Here we don't have a lot of\nconfidential information that people\n\n461\n00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.570\nare willing to spend\nthousands of dollars on or\n\n462\n00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.720\nhundred thousands of dollars to obtain.\n\n463\n00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.270\nBut if you're Lockheed Martin or\nsome company that does research and\n\n464\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.800\ndevelopment and\n\n465\n00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.210\nyou're working on that next product, how\nmuch is that worth to your competitors?\n\n466\n00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.690\nIf I can get my hands on that, I can turn\naround and sell it to your competitors and\n\n467\n00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:49.910\nI can go buy an island.\n\n468\n00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.642\nSo I'm willing to pay $50,000 to that\nguy who sits at the bar every night and\n\n469\n00:22:53.642 --> 00:22:56.292\ncomplains about work and\nheads over to the racetrack, and\n\n470\n00:22:56.292 --> 00:23:00.030\ntears up his tickets at the end of\nthe day because he didn't win anything.\n\n471\n00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.550\nYeah, I am willing to do that.\n\n472\n00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.110\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So keeping the employees happy.\n\n473\n00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.450\n&gt;&gt; That company that I worked for.\n\n474\n00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:08.990\nIt was a circuit board, producer of\ncircuit board manufacturing company,\n\n475\n00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.600\nand a lot of times, if you think about how\n\n476\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.470\na lot of our manufacturing has\nkind of infiltrated overseas.\n\n477\n00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.480\nCertain things you don't\nwant going overseas.\n\n478\n00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:22.300\nEspecially weaponry, because if they put\na little kill switch in your circuitry for\n\n479\n00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.730\nany kind of weapon.\n\n480\n00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.240\nWe don't want to be outsourcing that.\n\n481\n00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.070\nSo, things like that.\n\n482\n00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:30.300\nYou could see someone approaching you or\nanything like you said, with great value.\n\n483\n00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.040\n&gt;&gt; Can we say Sony?\n\n484\n00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.856\n[COUGH] Sony.\n\n485\n00:23:32.856 --> 00:23:34.789\n[LAUGH] Yeah, absolutely.\n\n486\n00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:36.069\nWe were talking right before the show.\n\n487\n00:23:36.069 --> 00:23:36.959\nIn fact, I've got it,\ndon't look at my computer.\n\n488\n00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:39.812\nI don't want you to share it, but-\n&gt;&gt; Show Mike's computer, please!\n\n489\n00:23:39.812 --> 00:23:42.017\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, I don't know\nthis gentleman, and whether or\n\n490\n00:23:42.017 --> 00:23:43.840\nnot we would be able to\nshare his information.\n\n491\n00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay, she's showing it.\n\n492\n00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.507\n&gt;&gt; So she showed it anyway, okay.\n\n493\n00:23:46.507 --> 00:23:48.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's give Troy Hunt credit\n\n494\n00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:49.190\nfor this one.\n\n495\n00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:51.430\nI was just googling\nsome information about-\n\n496\n00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:52.708\n&gt;&gt; I think it's interesting.\n\n497\n00:23:52.708 --> 00:23:53.509\n&gt;&gt; Cloud pets.\n\n498\n00:23:53.509 --> 00:23:58.570\nYeah, we had talked about some of this,\nI think the other day,\n\n499\n00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:04.681\nwe talked about IOT, and this is not\na case of anybody putting bad Firmware or\n\n500\n00:24:04.681 --> 00:24:10.126\nhacking in the manufacturing process,\nalthough that has happened\n\n501\n00:24:10.126 --> 00:24:15.980\nThey're getting malware injected\nduring the manufacturing process.\n\n502\n00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.230\nYou buy that thing off the shelf and\nit's already got malware in it.\n\n503\n00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.500\nThis is an example of an IoT-type device.\n\n504\n00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.210\nA little teddy bear that you could\nrecord a message on your phone.\n\n505\n00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:31.830\nAnd then your child could push a little\nbutton on his teddy bear there, or\n\n506\n00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.054\nthe kitty cat one.\n\n507\n00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:35.670\nAnd, it would replay that message.\n\n508\n00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.910\nSo you could send your child a message.\n\n509\n00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.220\nThe problem was that\nthe information from this company,\n\n510\n00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.740\nit wasn't actually this\ncompany that made the bear.\n\n511\n00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.580\nBut they had subbed out,\n\n512\n00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.668\nthey had a third party that was\nstoring their data in a database.\n\n513\n00:24:48.668 --> 00:24:51.670\nThe messages that were being recorded,\nand storing them for\n\n514\n00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.350\nplayback on these devices.\n\n515\n00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.660\nThey had that database being\nstored by this third party.\n\n516\n00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.550\nThat third party was storing the database\non an Internet facing server,\n\n517\n00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.470\nwith not even a password\nrequired to access it.\n\n518\n00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:02.290\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n\n519\n00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.410\nI actually received that cat one for\nmy kids, my mom got it for\n\n520\n00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.500\nthem for, I think it was Christmas.\n\n521\n00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.090\nAnd got rid of that thing posthaste,\nit was just too creepy.\n\n522\n00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.510\nIt reminded me of some\nlittle Chucky doll or\n\n523\n00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:17.330\nsomething like that, but\nmy mom had good intentions.\n\n524\n00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:18.290\nShe doesn't expect,\n\n525\n00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:23.010\nshe doesn't think about that from a\nparanoid person's perspective, like I am.\n\n526\n00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.980\nBut it is something that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n527\n00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.910\nAnd at least tell others\nabout these kinds of issues.\n\n528\n00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.770\n&gt;&gt; This is an example of an organization\nthat manufactured toys, and\n\n529\n00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.360\nmaybe they're not IT people.\n\n530\n00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.560\nI mean, hopefully they are, they're making\nsomething that takes advantage of this.\n\n531\n00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.950\nBut they decided to get a third\nparty to hold their data.\n\n532\n00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:44.290\nWe don't want to get into data storage and\nmanaging databases.\n\n533\n00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:46.380\nSo we're gonna get this\nthird party to do it.\n\n534\n00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.960\nBut didn't vet them properly, evidently.\n\n535\n00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.230\nDidn't take a look at them or\n\n536\n00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:53.180\ndidn't make sure that they\nwere following good practices.\n\n537\n00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.510\nBecause if they had known that\nthey were keeping this database\n\n538\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.320\nwithout even a password\nrequired to get access to it.\n\n539\n00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.110\nHopefully, they wouldn't have chosen that\nor would have switched organizations.\n\n540\n00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:07.260\nBut all of that information was leaked\nout and that's the scary thing.\n\n541\n00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.300\nIt wasn't the company A,\n\n542\n00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.059\nit was company B that they had\nhired that was causing the problem.\n\n543\n00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.982\nWhat else,\nI don't know how we got off on that.\n\n544\n00:26:16.982 --> 00:26:18.087\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I happened to\n\n545\n00:26:18.087 --> 00:26:21.230\nhave the little bears pulled\nup on my screen here.\n\n546\n00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.450\nBut it does tie in to everything\nelse that we've been talking about.\n\n547\n00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.715\nAbout some of the breaches\nthat have occurred recently.\n\n548\n00:26:27.715 --> 00:26:33.085\nAnd how that could have\nbeen prevented by making\n\n549\n00:26:33.085 --> 00:26:36.965\nsure they did their due diligence and\ndid their research on their third party.\n\n550\n00:26:36.965 --> 00:26:41.630\nAnd made sure that that hey, we're gonna\ntrust you to store customer information,\n\n551\n00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.950\nor customer data, messages to their kids.\n\n552\n00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:48.012\nWhich I'm sure had to include information\nabout who they were, their account,\n\n553\n00:26:48.012 --> 00:26:51.080\nyou had to set up an account and\nbe able to use the bear.\n\n554\n00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.940\nHad to have information about how to\nget that message to the appropriate\n\n555\n00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.210\nbear, right?\n\n556\n00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:58.820\nSo with the proper data mining,\nwe can figure out addresses from that or\n\n557\n00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.540\nlocations from that.\n\n558\n00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.640\nVery scary stuff.\n\n559\n00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.227\nNot to mention, who knows,\nsend creepy messages yourself.\n\n560\n00:27:05.227 --> 00:27:06.620\n&gt;&gt; I know, but here's the thing.\n\n561\n00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.660\nMy take on this is ultimately that company\n\n562\n00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.210\nshould be held responsible if\nsomething like that does happen.\n\n563\n00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.580\nBecause if they do not have employees\nwith that skill set, well guess what?\n\n564\n00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.470\nWhat about security as a service?\n\n565\n00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.793\nThey could outsource that, or maybe have\nsomeone else check out their product,\n\n566\n00:27:22.793 --> 00:27:26.411\ntheir prototypes,\nbefore pushing it out to market, right?\n\n567\n00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:27.300\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n568\n00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.650\nLots of thorough testing,\n\n569\n00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:33.040\nwhich actually we're gonna be talking\nabout it in our upcoming episode.\n\n570\n00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:38.170\nI haven't actually read to\nsee what the organization did\n\n571\n00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.460\nin response to that, yeah.\n\n572\n00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.700\nSo I'm gonna have to check that out.\n\n573\n00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.815\nBut back to our objectives here,\nwe talked about processes.\n\n574\n00:27:46.815 --> 00:27:50.300\nTechnology-wise, using\nautomated reporting techniques.\n\n575\n00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:54.070\nTrying to automate as much as we can is\ndefinitely helpful cause that frees us up\n\n576\n00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.430\nto do the actual analysis part of things.\n\n577\n00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:01.285\nSo being able to crunch that,\nsecurity appliances and security suites.\n\n578\n00:28:01.285 --> 00:28:06.192\nSecurity appliances is just boxes\nthat we might plug into our network,\n\n579\n00:28:06.192 --> 00:28:09.340\nlike intrusion detection systems.\n\n580\n00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.870\nOr we've got a Barracuda spam\nfilter that'd be considered\n\n581\n00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.920\na type of security appliance.\n\n582\n00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.500\n&gt;&gt; Hardware security modules.\n\n583\n00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n584\n00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.070\nSecurity suites,\nprograms that do more than one thing.\n\n585\n00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:29.312\nWe see that where an application\ncan handle multiple functions.\n\n586\n00:28:29.312 --> 00:28:32.340\n&gt;&gt; We hear that term UTM a lot,\nfor unified threat management.\n\n587\n00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.151\nBecause it just makes things well,\na lot easier for us.\n\n588\n00:28:35.151 --> 00:28:38.162\n&gt;&gt; It does, I mean, one interface\nto manage my different aspects of\n\n589\n00:28:38.162 --> 00:28:40.319\nsecurity on my network,\ncan be very helpful.\n\n590\n00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:43.260\nThe only down side to those,\nwell, I won't say, the only.\n\n591\n00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.570\nBut some of the concerns\nyou might have with those.\n\n592\n00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:49.470\nIf that fails, for some reason,\nit's not one component that's failed now.\n\n593\n00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.620\nIt's several components, right?\n\n594\n00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.312\nBecause unified threat\nmanagement was doing all of it.\n\n595\n00:28:53.312 --> 00:28:57.500\nIf it's compromised, that could lead\nto exposure in many different areas.\n\n596\n00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.450\nSo that is something you want\nto take into consideration.\n\n597\n00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.100\nOutsourcing, security is a service.\n\n598\n00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:09.020\nIf I don't have the expertise or\nthe man power, maybe I'll wanna look at\n\n599\n00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:13.080\nhiring somebody or an organization\nto provide security for me.\n\n600\n00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.090\nAgain, that's gonna require\nyour due diligence.\n\n601\n00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:19.720\nYou're gonna make sure that\nthe organization has a good track record,\n\n602\n00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.140\nthat you have contracts in place.\n\n603\n00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.230\nOff topic, but\n\n604\n00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.180\nI know Amazon S3 went down the other day.\n\n605\n00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.800\nAnd I was reading some\ninteresting articles on that.\n\n606\n00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.790\nCuz it kinda reminded me of when I say\ncontracts, I see a lot of people going,\n\n607\n00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.150\nhow are they ever gonna recover?\n\n608\n00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.110\nCuz in their contract,\nthey promised five nines and\n\n609\n00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.900\nthey've already had three\nhours of down time.\n\n610\n00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.375\nAnd so it's gonna take them\n15 years to get back to.\n\n611\n00:29:42.375 --> 00:29:46.920\nI haven't done the math, so\ndon't quote me on those numbers, I'm just.\n\n612\n00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:51.250\nAnd from what I was reading, I did\na quick just sweep through all the posts.\n\n613\n00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.430\nAnd somebody was like, they don't do\nfive nines, it was only four nines.\n\n614\n00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:55.480\nAnd so I don't know.\n\n615\n00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.080\nBut I'm just saying,\n\n616\n00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.780\nit's kind of interesting to\nthink about it in that respect.\n\n617\n00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.225\nWhat else, cryptography.\n\n618\n00:30:01.225 --> 00:30:05.374\nYou know there's another great technology\nthat we can use to provide security,\n\n619\n00:30:05.374 --> 00:30:06.550\nit's another layer.\n\n620\n00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:10.770\nWe know that in our file systems\nwe have access control lists,\n\n621\n00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.450\nwe have file permissions that\nwe can use to control access.\n\n622\n00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.160\nSo why do we need encryption?\n\n623\n00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.110\nBecause it's another layer of defense.\n\n624\n00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:21.550\nIf somebody does do,\nI break somebody's password and now,\n\n625\n00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.961\nor escalate my credentials.\n\n626\n00:30:22.961 --> 00:30:26.730\nSo that I am in a group that does\nhave access to the information.\n\n627\n00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.870\nIf it's encrypted, and I don't have\nthe appropriate certificate or key,\n\n628\n00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.220\nI'm not gonna get into it anyway.\n\n629\n00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.884\nWhether it says I have NTFS permissions or\nnot,\n\n630\n00:30:33.884 --> 00:30:36.693\nI don't have the key to\ndecrypt the information.\n\n631\n00:30:36.693 --> 00:30:39.800\nAnd I'm still not gonna\nget access to that.\n\n632\n00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.209\nSo using cryptography as a tool.\n\n633\n00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.810\nOther security concepts that I know\nwe've learned in SecurityPlus,\n\n634\n00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.890\nI just wanna mention them again.\n\n635\n00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.130\nNetwork design, right?\n\n636\n00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.840\nHaving a good, solid network design, this\ntypically includes network segmentation.\n\n637\n00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:01.670\nBreaking my network down\ninto smaller components so\n\n638\n00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:06.130\nthat we can better control\nthe traffic that's flowing between.\n\n639\n00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.420\nI know years ago, and we still do, but\n\n640\n00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:15.110\nyears ago we were really worried about\nsegregating networks more for congestion.\n\n641\n00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:19.500\nNow we've got tons of bandwidth floating\naround and it's not as big a deal.\n\n642\n00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.224\nBut we still segregate out our networks so\nthat I can control access.\n\n643\n00:31:23.224 --> 00:31:28.540\nI can use a router\nthat's looking at those.\n\n644\n00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.610\nThat data's coming through, and\nsay no, you're not allowed.\n\n645\n00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:35.350\nThat subnet's not allowed to\ntalk to this particular subnet.\n\n646\n00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:39.950\nSo I can control that access,\nthat's just another layer of security.\n\n647\n00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:43.340\nSo in the end,\nwhen we talk about defense in depth.\n\n648\n00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.450\nAnd I do want to throw another one\nin there that's not on the list,\n\n649\n00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.340\nsecurity through obscurity.\n\n650\n00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.769\nYou hear that one a lot as well.\n\n651\n00:31:49.769 --> 00:31:50.346\n&gt;&gt; Obfuscation.\n\n652\n00:31:50.346 --> 00:31:52.300\n&gt;&gt; Obfuscation, there we go.\n\n653\n00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.239\nBig word of the day.\n\n654\n00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.420\nIs another part of layers of defense.\n\n655\n00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.583\nThe one thing I will say about that\nthough, cuz I hear people say that a lot.\n\n656\n00:32:00.583 --> 00:32:03.941\nAnd I just want to make sure\nwe understand that it's not\n\n657\n00:32:03.941 --> 00:32:06.721\na very good security technique, all right?\n\n658\n00:32:06.721 --> 00:32:11.949\nIt works as long it's not the only\nmethod of security that you have.\n\n659\n00:32:11.949 --> 00:32:13.224\nYou know, it definitely helps.\n\n660\n00:32:13.224 --> 00:32:15.574\nIt' definitely worth doing, but\n\n661\n00:32:15.574 --> 00:32:20.194\nit cannot be the only one because\nsomebody will find it eventually,\n\n662\n00:32:20.194 --> 00:32:24.910\nand if you have nothing else\nprotecting it, that's pretty much it.\n\n663\n00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.280\n&gt;&gt; So, for example,\n\n664\n00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.680\nlike if we have, like we were talking\nabout earlier, key distribution.\n\n665\n00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.730\nAnd, if we look at that word, entropy.\n\n666\n00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:33.550\nEntropy?\n\n667\n00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:34.760\nI always say it a little funny.\n\n668\n00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.350\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n669\n00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so when, an example of that,\n\n670\n00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:41.560\nwhen we're talking about\npasswords would be our keys.\n\n671\n00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.270\nKey stretching, so\nwhen you transmit that key,\n\n672\n00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:48.450\nyou would also want to use encryption and\nrely on that, but\n\n673\n00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:54.150\nthen also introduce that entropy or\nobfuscation, to kind of just guess what?\n\n674\n00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.422\nAdd another onion layer, right?\n\n675\n00:32:55.422 --> 00:32:56.950\n&gt;&gt; Another onion layer, exactly.\n\n676\n00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.397\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Told you guys,\nyou can learn everything from Shrek today.\n\n677\n00:32:59.397 --> 00:33:03.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I hear people say all the time,\ndon't write passwords down.\n\n678\n00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.660\nIt's horrible to write passwords down.\n\n679\n00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.190\nAnd I'm sorry, I'm one of the few\nsecurity people that will say\n\n680\n00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.700\nit's not the worst thing in\nthe world to write a password down.\n\n681\n00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.350\nThe problem is, where you keep that and\nhow you write it down.\n\n682\n00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.020\nRight, don't write it down and\ntape it to your monitor.\n\n683\n00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.020\nThat's not a good thing.\n\n684\n00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.410\n&gt;&gt; Or put it under your keyboard.\n\n685\n00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:19.620\n&gt;&gt; Don't put it under your keyboard.\n\n686\n00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.000\nWe all know to check there.\n\n687\n00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.470\nYour desk drawer,\nright that's not gonna be good.\n\n688\n00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:26.940\nSo, we're expected to remember,\n&gt;&gt; Or,\n\n689\n00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.895\nin a Notepad document on your computer.\n\n690\n00:33:28.895 --> 00:33:30.024\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n691\n00:33:30.024 --> 00:33:32.092\nyou go to somebody's house to\nhelp them with their computer and\n\n692\n00:33:32.092 --> 00:33:33.847\nyou see this piece of paper\ntaped to the side of it, and\n\n693\n00:33:33.847 --> 00:33:36.048\nit's got all their accounts, and\nall of their passwords listed.\n\n694\n00:33:36.048 --> 00:33:37.478\n&gt;&gt; Where is that file stored, yeah?\n\n695\n00:33:37.478 --> 00:33:40.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's crazy.\n\n696\n00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:44.950\nBut, if I mix that up a little bit, let's\nsay I have account one, two, and three.\n\n697\n00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:48.590\nBut the password for account one is\nactually written next to account three,\n\n698\n00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:52.560\nand the password for account two is I\ncould kinda rearrange them that way.\n\n699\n00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.797\nIf I ever write a password down,\nI always put four or\n\n700\n00:33:54.797 --> 00:33:56.731\nfive letters at the beginning and\nthen end.\n\n701\n00:33:56.731 --> 00:33:59.090\nI'm the only one that\nknows to pull that out.\n\n702\n00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:03.125\nOr I'll put all random characters\nin between every character, so\n\n703\n00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:07.105\nthat I know that it's only the odd\ncharacters that make my password up.\n\n704\n00:34:07.105 --> 00:34:10.370\nI mean, there are ways you can\nsecurely write passwords down.\n\n705\n00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.954\nIt's just you know,\nyou just don't write them down.\n\n706\n00:34:12.954 --> 00:34:14.315\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to be predictable.\n\n707\n00:34:14.315 --> 00:34:15.787\nIt's always about that.\n\n708\n00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:19.027\nHighly or\nstrongly non random concept, right?\n\n709\n00:34:19.027 --> 00:34:19.647\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n710\n00:34:19.647 --> 00:34:23.017\nKinda like we're doing here,\nsomehow we gonna off on passwords but\n\n711\n00:34:23.017 --> 00:34:26.407\nyeah, it's all good when we talk,\nwhen we talk about security.\n\n712\n00:34:26.407 --> 00:34:29.907\nSo, again, just wanna make sure we\nunderstand that that is a term that you'll\n\n713\n00:34:29.907 --> 00:34:35.030\nhear obscurity, security through obscurity\nand it's not that it's not a valid\n\n714\n00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.780\nSecurity method,\nit can provide some level of security.\n\n715\n00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.130\nIt's just we don't wanna rely on\nthat because it's not on it's own,\n\n716\n00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:44.880\nit's not very effective.\n\n717\n00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.930\n&gt;&gt; Mike, we have covered a lot.\n\n718\n00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:48.480\nWe are looking at different\ntypes of Security architectures,\n\n719\n00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.160\nall the different techniques that we\ncan implement to really just make\n\n720\n00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.550\nthe best out of the R environments and\nkeep them secure.\n\n721\n00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.700\nSo, thank you so much for\njoining us today.\n\n722\n00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.170\nAnd thank you ladies and gentlemen,\nbut stay comfortable, stay tuned.\n\n723\n00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:01.860\nWe have more information headed your way.\n\n724\n00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.030\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n725\n00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.790\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n726\n00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.879\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n727\n00:35:08.879 -->

Welcome to your Comp TS Cyber\nSecurity Analyst Plus Series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:17.857\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.857 --> 00:00:21.385\nIn this episode, we will be looking\nat application security, and\n\n7\n00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:24.976\nI would say that there's an app for\nthat, but I'm not really sure.\n\n8\n00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:26.715\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So instead of taking my chances,\n\n9\n00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:29.312\nlet's go ahead and\nroll the dice with Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:31.293\nThank you for joining us today Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:31.293 --> 00:00:32.620\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, thanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.521\nGlad to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:35.693\nAnd yeah,\nI don't know if there is an app for that.\n\n14\n00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:38.895\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Might need an app to make sure that\n\n15\n00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:40.046\nit's secure.\n\n16\n00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:45.463\nYeah, application security,\nwhen we look at application security,\n\n17\n00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:50.608\nreally what we want to talk about\nhere is best practices when it comes\n\n18\n00:00:50.608 --> 00:00:55.511\nto software development and\nwriting code, writing software.\n\n19\n00:00:55.511 --> 00:00:56.378\nIt's very important.\n\n20\n00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:59.711\nAnd I think most organizations\nare realizing this lately, or\n\n21\n00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:03.427\nthey have the last few years,\nhow important it is to include security\n\n22\n00:01:03.427 --> 00:01:06.589\nall the way through the software\ndevelopment life cycle?\n\n23\n00:01:06.589 --> 00:01:10.908\nIt's not good enough anymore\nto just tackle on the end.\n\n24\n00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:14.715\nUnfortunately, even though most\npeople were aware of this,\n\n25\n00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:18.459\nit's not always practice because\nthere is a rush to market.\n\n26\n00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.968\nWe need to get our product\nout before our competitors,\n\n27\n00:01:21.968 --> 00:01:26.942\nI just need to make sure it's working,\nwe can go back and add security later.\n\n28\n00:01:26.942 --> 00:01:29.503\nIt adds time to the project.\n\n29\n00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:31.382\nIt does add complexity to the project.\n\n30\n00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:34.269\nWe have another skill set\nwe need to bring in for\n\n31\n00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:38.871\nour developers when it comes to\nfollowing good secure coding practices.\n\n32\n00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:44.383\nSo for some organizations,\nthey would rather skip past some of that.\n\n33\n00:01:44.383 --> 00:01:49.152\nBut as a CSA, we need to\nunderstand what's going on there.\n\n34\n00:01:49.152 --> 00:01:53.392\nSo it talks about best practices for\nsoftware development and\n\n35\n00:01:53.392 --> 00:01:57.641\nI want to talk about, again,\nthe requirements definition.\n\n36\n00:01:57.641 --> 00:02:02.905\nAnd really, what we're saying as I\nsaid already, security has to be in\n\n37\n00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:08.106\nyour mind as part of the development\nprocess from the very beginning.\n\n38\n00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:13.918\nWe've seen it in examples\nrecently where like IPV4, right?\n\n39\n00:02:13.918 --> 00:02:16.495\nIPV4, when it was originally developed,\n\n40\n00:02:16.495 --> 00:02:20.684\nsecurity was not in the forefront of\na lot of those developers' minds.\n\n41\n00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:21.831\nAnd we suffer for that, right?\n\n42\n00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:26.203\nWe had to add security later on,\nwhich we did, things like IP sec and\n\n43\n00:02:26.203 --> 00:02:31.268\nother technologies that are bolt on,\nafter the fact, and are never gonna be as\n\n44\n00:02:31.268 --> 00:02:36.450\ngood as if they were baked in to the\noriginal product, like with IPV6, right?\n\n45\n00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.888\nWe see a lot more security because it\nwas designed with security in mind.\n\n46\n00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:47.068\nSo when you're writing code,\nwhen you're writing software and\n\n47\n00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:49.728\nyou've got your in-house developers,\n\n48\n00:02:49.728 --> 00:02:54.983\nit's important that we establish that\nenvironment of writing good secure code.\n\n49\n00:02:54.983 --> 00:03:00.251\nWe talk about some of the testing\nphases for application development,\n\n50\n00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:05.452\none of the methods that they call out\nis known as static code analysis.\n\n51\n00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:09.118\nAnd static code analysis is\na way of looking at the code\n\n52\n00:03:09.118 --> 00:03:11.163\nwithout executing the code.\n\n53\n00:03:11.163 --> 00:03:15.798\nThis could be a manual process,\nwhere we have people just sitting\n\n54\n00:03:15.798 --> 00:03:20.450\nthere looking at it line by line,\nand looking for bad practices.\n\n55\n00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.450\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like a code review?\n\n56\n00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.728\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly like a code review.\n\n57\n00:03:22.728 --> 00:03:23.551\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n58\n00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:27.633\n&gt;&gt; If somebody is using an older command\nthat's been replaced with the newer,\n\n59\n00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:29.610\nsecure version of that command, but\n\n60\n00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.784\nthey're still using that old string\ncommand, or whatever it happens to be.\n\n61\n00:03:33.784 --> 00:03:40.265\nJust doing a manual pruse of that code.\n\n62\n00:03:40.265 --> 00:03:43.350\nGood, can be very effective but\nit is very time consuming,\n\n63\n00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.488\nyou got to have the person that's skilled\nin doing that and there's always that\n\n64\n00:03:47.488 --> 00:03:51.503\nchance to miss something, especially\nwhen you're examining thousands and\n\n65\n00:03:51.503 --> 00:03:54.123\nthousands of lines of code\nthat can be difficult.\n\n66\n00:03:54.123 --> 00:03:58.808\nSo we can definitely automate this\nprocess, well, there's several tools\n\n67\n00:03:58.808 --> 00:04:03.798\ncommercial, open-source, both categories\nfor doing static code analysis.\n\n68\n00:04:03.798 --> 00:04:08.291\nSome of them that you should be\nfamiliar with, a WASP, for example,\n\n69\n00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:09.612\nhas several tools.\n\n70\n00:04:09.612 --> 00:04:14.205\nThe ones I happened to write down,\ntheir code crawler does .NET and Java.\n\n71\n00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:17.650\nOne of the things you'll find\nabout these static code analysis\n\n72\n00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.259\ntools is that some of\nthem are multi-purpose.\n\n73\n00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.910\nEspecially the commercial ones.\n\n74\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.255\nAre designed to examine many\ndifferent languages .NET, Java,\n\n75\n00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:29.496\nscripting languages,\nPHP, things like that.\n\n76\n00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:33.172\nSome of the open source\none are more specific.\n\n77\n00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:36.310\nThere's an open source one for\nPHP but that's all it does.\n\n78\n00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.158\nThere's an open source one for\nJavaScript but that's all it does.\n\n79\n00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:44.913\nSo, finding the right tool for what your\ndeveloper use is part of that process.\n\n80\n00:04:44.913 --> 00:04:48.741\nSo understanding what languages are we\nusing in our software development life\n\n81\n00:04:48.741 --> 00:04:49.961\ncycle, what do we need?\n\n82\n00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:53.457\nBut OWASP has their code crawler.\n\n83\n00:04:53.457 --> 00:04:55.348\nOWASP has a lot of information.\n\n84\n00:04:55.348 --> 00:04:58.006\nWe'll take a look at their\nsite maybe in a minute.\n\n85\n00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:02.480\nOpen source tools like R-I-P-S or\nRIPS does PHP.\n\n86\n00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.606\nMicrosoft has there FX COP,\nwhich does .NET.\n\n87\n00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:09.491\nGoogle code search, Digidi,\nI just like that name.\n\n88\n00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:12.329\n&gt;&gt; I know [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Also does several\n\n89\n00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:15.134\nlanguage\n&gt;&gt; Are they Snoop Dogg affiliated\n\n90\n00:05:15.134 --> 00:05:16.297\nwith that at all?\n\n91\n00:05:16.297 --> 00:05:18.048\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know, he should be.\n\n92\n00:05:18.048 --> 00:05:19.853\nThey should get him to do a commercial.\n\n93\n00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:22.629\nAnd then there's commercial\nproducts like Fortify and\n\n94\n00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.062\nVericode that are gonna be a little\nmore robust maybe in what they do.\n\n95\n00:05:26.062 --> 00:05:27.844\nIf you pay for that license.\n\n96\n00:05:27.844 --> 00:05:31.301\nSo, lots of tools out there we can\ndo that static code analysis with.\n\n97\n00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:35.922\nAgain, static code analysis\nexamining the code line by\n\n98\n00:05:35.922 --> 00:05:39.574\nline without actually executing the code.\n\n99\n00:05:39.574 --> 00:05:43.558\nThen you've got your web app\nvulnerability scanners and\n\n100\n00:05:43.558 --> 00:05:46.217\nweb apps are the thing today, right?\n\n101\n00:05:46.217 --> 00:05:47.522\nEverything is on the web.\n\n102\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:51.403\nWe've got a web application that's\nbeing hosted by that web server,\n\n103\n00:05:51.403 --> 00:05:54.181\nthat's providing some\nservice to our end users.\n\n104\n00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:56.341\nAnd that's where we're\nfinding the vulnerabilities.\n\n105\n00:05:56.341 --> 00:06:01.515\nSo it's very, very important that we're\ndoing secure software development.\n\n106\n00:06:01.515 --> 00:06:03.861\nAs well as testing our own products and\n\n107\n00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:07.027\nusing tools to do web app\nvulnerability scanning.\n\n108\n00:06:07.027 --> 00:06:10.539\nAnother OWASP too, l Zap,\nthe Zed application proxy,\n\n109\n00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.943\nis one that I've used several times.\n\n110\n00:06:12.943 --> 00:06:20.604\nSQL Map is another one that can help you\nfind vulnerabilities in SQL servers.\n\n111\n00:06:20.604 --> 00:06:25.353\nNIC 2 is another web app\nvulnerabilities scanner.\n\n112\n00:06:25.353 --> 00:06:27.663\nAnd the funny thing is,\nis where I've seen these,\n\n113\n00:06:27.663 --> 00:06:30.791\nI actually haven't been part of\na software development life cycle.\n\n114\n00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.241\nWhere I see these tools is on\nthe hacking side of things,\n\n115\n00:06:33.241 --> 00:06:36.645\nbecause we all know those administrative\ntools typically make really good-\n\n116\n00:06:36.645 --> 00:06:38.134\n&gt;&gt; You use the same tools, yeah.\n\n117\n00:06:38.134 --> 00:06:39.664\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n118\n00:06:39.664 --> 00:06:42.857\nThey do a good job at what they do.\n\n119\n00:06:42.857 --> 00:06:45.272\nAnd nothings gonna stop the bad\nguy from using those same tools.\n\n120\n00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:47.090\nSo the point I wanna make there is,\n\n121\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.484\nif they're gonna be examining your website\nand your web applications with ZAP p and\n\n122\n00:06:51.484 --> 00:06:54.769\nNIC 2 and things like that,\nmaybe you should be too, right.\n\n123\n00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:59.036\nBefore they find those vulnerabilities,\nyou can have your developers or you or\n\n124\n00:06:59.036 --> 00:07:03.619\nwhoever it is go to those, look for those\nvulnerabilities, find them, patch them,\n\n125\n00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:05.800\nmitigate them, whatever you gotta do.\n\n126\n00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.056\nBefore the bad guys do.\n\n127\n00:07:07.056 --> 00:07:10.450\n&gt;&gt; So basically Mike, what this is,\nI just wanna clarify,\n\n128\n00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.334\nwe're running an application through\na particular utility that is checking many\n\n129\n00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:17.403\niterations of vulnerabilities.\n\n130\n00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:21.187\nAnd usually they'll start with the most\ncommon vulnerabilities first and\n\n131\n00:07:21.187 --> 00:07:22.757\nkinda trickle down that list.\n\n132\n00:07:22.757 --> 00:07:24.937\nOr go through all these different,\nbasically,\n\n133\n00:07:24.937 --> 00:07:27.716\nexecution's trying to break\nthat particular application?\n\n134\n00:07:27.716 --> 00:07:31.198\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they have databases of known\nvulnerabilities and things to look for\n\n135\n00:07:31.198 --> 00:07:34.249\nin the code that would leave you\nsusceptible to a vulnerability.\n\n136\n00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:38.888\nAnd they're just scanning away, looking to\nsee if anything matches those, in fact,\n\n137\n00:07:38.888 --> 00:07:39.722\nlet's do one.\n\n138\n00:07:39.722 --> 00:07:43.346\nI know I said the demo days are coming up,\nbut let's take a look at one here.\n\n139\n00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:45.491\nI've got my Kali Linux box opened up.\n\n140\n00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:48.762\nAnd let's fire up, what shall we do?\n\n141\n00:07:48.762 --> 00:07:51.975\nLet's do?\n\n142\n00:07:51.975 --> 00:07:55.948\nAnd you can see a list of nice tools here,\nBurp Suite, another great one.\n\n143\n00:07:55.948 --> 00:07:56.750\nWhat's another one?\n\n144\n00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:04.130\nWebScarab, that's another one by OWasp,\nw3af is another good one.\n\n145\n00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:10.271\nBut, let's do Zap here,\nthat's a nice little GUI interface for\n\n146\n00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:17.640\nthe demonstration And, no I don't need to\npersist any of my data for the time being.\n\n147\n00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.674\nAnd, no, we don't wanna check for\nupdates for right now.\n\n148\n00:08:23.397 --> 00:08:25.412\nCuz, that will take, oops.\n\n149\n00:08:25.412 --> 00:08:26.275\nThat will take too long.\n\n150\n00:08:27.285 --> 00:08:30.434\nAll right, so again this is ZAP,\nand it's very easy to use.\n\n151\n00:08:30.434 --> 00:08:36.436\nYou put in your URL, let's do www.itpro.tv\n&gt;&gt; You're brave.\n\n152\n00:08:36.436 --> 00:08:37.143\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n153\n00:08:37.143 --> 00:08:39.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll go ahead and click attack.\n\n154\n00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.060\nIt's interesting that it says attack.\n\n155\n00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.975\nIt's not necessarily,\ndo I have the network connection in here?\n\n156\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.600\nTell me I do, I do.\n\n157\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:54.593\nInteresting, it's taking its\nsweet time to get started here.\n\n158\n00:08:54.593 --> 00:08:55.830\nWe'll let it run for just a second.\n\n159\n00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.810\nThere we go, and as soon as I get a couple\nof things, I'm just gonna stop this,\n\n160\n00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.520\nI don't want any unnecessary\ntraffic on our web server.\n\n161\n00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.680\nBut keep in mind, as we always say with\ntools like this and in all of our security\n\n162\n00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.600\nclasses, have permissions\nbefore you run tools like this.\n\n163\n00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.561\nNotice the button does say, attack.\n\n164\n00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:15.389\nRight, because you are hammering their\nsystem, doing queries, trying to look for\n\n165\n00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:20.220\nthese vulnerabilities and the other thing\nis they're most likely gonna detect it.\n\n166\n00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.544\nIf they've got anything running,\nmonitoring,\n\n167\n00:09:22.544 --> 00:09:26.250\nthey're gonna see this activity and\nthey are gonna detect it, and if you don't\n\n168\n00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.260\nhave permissions from the owner, you can\nend up facing some serious repercussions.\n\n169\n00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.920\n&gt;&gt; You got your get out of jail\nfree card in your pocket, Mike?\n\n170\n00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Well I know the owner here and\n\n171\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.540\nhopefully-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.190\n&gt;&gt; As long as I didn't do any severe\n\n173\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.260\ndamage, we should be good to go.\n\n174\n00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.870\nAnd let's just take a look at some of\nthe results here, go down to sites,\n\n175\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.659\nyou can see a navigating\nover here in this far pain.\n\n176\n00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:52.214\nAnd we're just gonna take a look at these,\nlike get robots.text,\n\n177\n00:09:52.214 --> 00:09:57.050\nto get sitemap.text, down here at\nthe bottom, I've got my alerts and\n\n178\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.290\nagain, I didn't let this finish.\n\n179\n00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.150\nBut, there is some information\nlike cross site domain.\n\n180\n00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.470\nMaybe I should pull these up on screen,\nshow you some of our vulnerabilities.\n\n181\n00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.271\nOur guys here are really\ngood at looking in this.\n\n182\n00:10:07.271 --> 00:10:10.017\nAnd, that's the thing you need to keep\nin mind too with tools like this,\n\n183\n00:10:10.017 --> 00:10:11.950\nyou're gonna get a lot of false positives.\n\n184\n00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:16.900\nThings that it sees as vulnerability,\nyou might of already seen, mitigated,\n\n185\n00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.770\ndone what you needed to do and it's not\nnecessarily vulnerability for you anymore.\n\n186\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.500\nSo do keep that in mind,\nit is a learning process.\n\n187\n00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.793\nYou gotta be able interpret these results.\n\n188\n00:10:25.793 --> 00:10:29.250\nAnd I'm not gonna go through any of this.\n\n189\n00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.060\nBut just to get an idea it's telling\nme that there might be problems.\n\n190\n00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:38.730\nIt's saying this is a low risk, confidence\nis medium in what they have discovered.\n\n191\n00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.140\nSo, then it's my job to go in and\nlook at these, and decide one,\n\n192\n00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.900\nwhether they are a true vulnerability,\nand what that risk is.\n\n193\n00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.284\nDo my risk assessment on it, and\ndecide how much effort we need to put into\n\n194\n00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:55.671\nmitigating, and how we're gonna\nchoose to mitigate that type of risk.\n\n195\n00:10:55.671 --> 00:11:01.380\nBut, that's just one example of\na web app vulnerability scanner.\n\n196\n00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:08.490\nAgain, there are dozens and\ndozens of those out there available.\n\n197\n00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.530\nAnother one, so\n\n198\n00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.630\nwe were talking about doing static code\nanalysis on the code itself for your.\n\n199\n00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.700\nWhatever software you're developing.\n\n200\n00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.070\nFor your websites, making sure we\n\n201\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.800\ndo our web app vulnerability scans\nthat we know what we're dealing with.\n\n202\n00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.100\nMake sure we find them\nbefore the bad guys.\n\n203\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.730\nFuzzing is another one\nthat we'll talk about.\n\n204\n00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:34.180\nFuzzing is the concept of sending Data,\nother than what's\n\n205\n00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.100\nexpected to a web application, or\na form and seeing what happens.\n\n206\n00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.792\nBasically, throwing the kitchen and\nsink at it, and seeing what sticks.\n\n207\n00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:46.285\nThat's the idea behind fuzzy.\n\n208\n00:11:46.285 --> 00:11:49.219\nCherokee you have given me some\ninformation about the origins of\n\n209\n00:11:49.219 --> 00:11:50.096\nfuzzing earlier.\n\n210\n00:11:50.096 --> 00:11:53.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, Wisconsin brings\nyou more then just great cheese.\n\n211\n00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.580\nThat's actually where\nthe first project was created.\n\n212\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.900\nIt was called the fuzz\ngenerator in the 80s.\n\n213\n00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.215\nI think it was around 1988,\nand It was a class project and\n\n214\n00:12:03.215 --> 00:12:05.820\nthat's where this concept\nreally comes from.\n\n215\n00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:06.547\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n216\n00:12:06.547 --> 00:12:10.497\nAnd the idea here, really is, we wanna\nknow what's gonna happen when data\n\n217\n00:12:10.497 --> 00:12:13.758\nother than what's expected\ngets popped in because, again,\n\n218\n00:12:13.758 --> 00:12:15.720\nthat's what the bad guys are doing.\n\n219\n00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.503\nAnd, that's how we end up breaking\napplications or it'll lead to-\n\n220\n00:12:20.503 --> 00:12:21.520\n&gt;&gt; Integer overflows.\n\n221\n00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.255\n&gt;&gt; Buffer overflows, yeah, exactly.\n\n222\n00:12:24.255 --> 00:12:29.250\nAll kinds of text, SQL injection,\nany type of command injection.\n\n223\n00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:33.580\nThis is one of the techniques\nwe can use to find that kind of\n\n224\n00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.750\nthing before it gets taken advantage of.\n\n225\n00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.637\nYou can write your own fuzzers in\njust about any scripting language.\n\n226\n00:12:39.637 --> 00:12:42.300\nJust, pulling out Python or something, and\n\n227\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:47.762\nwriting some code that generates different\nvariable lengths of character strings.\n\n228\n00:12:47.762 --> 00:12:50.176\nYeah, cuz when you go to a website,\nfor example,\n\n229\n00:12:50.176 --> 00:12:54.146\nwhat I'm talking about is typically when\napplications that have some type of user\n\n230\n00:12:54.146 --> 00:12:55.713\ninput where I need to register.\n\n231\n00:12:55.713 --> 00:12:59.765\nSo I've gotta put in a username\nthat I wanna use and a password.\n\n232\n00:12:59.765 --> 00:13:03.810\nI've gotta fill in information about my\nname and my address and my phone number,\n\n233\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.410\nand things like that and submit it right?\n\n234\n00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.950\nClicking on that Submit button,\nthat's easier doing get or\n\n235\n00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.430\npost request on the background submitting\ndata back to the server to be processed\n\n236\n00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.950\nand the problem is let's say we\nhave a last name field, right?\n\n237\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.930\nHow long does it need to be?\n\n238\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.735\nYou gonna figure out what average your\nlast name are, give yourself a little\n\n239\n00:13:23.735 --> 00:13:27.495\nbit of buffer there and that's it but\nit shouldn't be 255 characters.\n\n240\n00:13:27.495 --> 00:13:31.020\nHow many last names\nare actually 255 characters?\n\n241\n00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:36.190\nI can write a small or\na pretty large sequel command with that.\n\n242\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.530\nWhat happens if I put letters\nin the phone number field,\n\n243\n00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.790\ndoes it crash the application?\n\n244\n00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.050\nDoes it crash the web server?\n\n245\n00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:46.590\nAm I basically gonna end up doing a really\neasy denial of service on a website?\n\n246\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.909\nIf I can go in there and put some bad\ncharacters in there, that I was not\n\n247\n00:13:49.909 --> 00:13:53.403\nexpecting and the web application\ndoesn't have any code to handle those\n\n248\n00:13:53.403 --> 00:13:57.369\nexecutions or we're not doing input\nvalidation, which I'm gonna come back to.\n\n249\n00:13:57.369 --> 00:13:59.306\nAnd that,\nis actually sent back to the server and\n\n250\n00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:02.870\nit doesn't know what to do with it and\nends up crashing the application.\n\n251\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.420\n&gt;&gt;

And if you're just shipping and\n\n272\n00:15:23.454 --> 00:15:27.632\nselling to United States customers and\nyou know that how many characters or\n\n273\n00:15:27.632 --> 00:15:31.211\nnumbers are in a zip code, then,\nlike you had mentioned there,\n\n274\n00:15:31.211 --> 00:15:34.975\nhow many fields do you have\navailable in the particular field?\n\n275\n00:15:34.975 --> 00:15:37.863\nOr characters can be input into that\nfield, and that's what those parameters\n\n276\n00:15:37.863 --> 00:15:39.889\nare what you're gonna be\nchecking with that utility.\n\n277\n00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:42.726\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n278\n00:15:42.726 --> 00:15:44.942\nWhat else now?\n\n279\n00:15:44.942 --> 00:15:50.278\nSo we'll talk a little bit more, again,\nI wanna come back to the concept of.\n\n280\n00:15:50.278 --> 00:15:50.865\nWhat was I thinking of?\n\n281\n00:15:50.865 --> 00:15:53.490\nInput validation,\nbecause that's an extremely important one.\n\n282\n00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.380\nIt kinda falls in line.\n\n283\n00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:54.950\nIn fact, let's go ahead and talk about it.\n\n284\n00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.996\nI don't know where it is in my notes,\nbut we'll talk about it now and\n\n285\n00:15:57.996 --> 00:15:59.880\nthen we'll just skip it when I come to it.\n\n286\n00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:05.058\nInput validation is the one thing that to\nme it's just such an easy thing to do,\n\n287\n00:16:05.058 --> 00:16:07.577\nand I don't see it being done enough.\n\n288\n00:16:07.577 --> 00:16:10.568\nBut when we're talking\nabout input validation,\n\n289\n00:16:10.568 --> 00:16:15.123\nany time you're gonna accept input from\na user of your system, an end user,\n\n290\n00:16:15.123 --> 00:16:17.490\na customer, we need to validate that.\n\n291\n00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.490\nAnd not just in one place.\n\n292\n00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.190\nIt needs to be done in\nmore than one place.\n\n293\n00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:24.280\nIt should be validated before\nit ever leaves the web server.\n\n294\n00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.040\nWe want to validate it again on the back\nend, when it's getting processed.\n\n295\n00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.200\nBut it should be validated before\nit ever leaves the site because\n\n296\n00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.690\nI should be scrubbing that information.\n\n297\n00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:37.650\nI should be looking for special characters\nthat is gonna lead me to believe that\n\n298\n00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:41.510\nthere is some kind of SQL injection or\ncommand injection type attack.\n\n299\n00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:44.081\nDo I really need to allow HTML tags or\n\n300\n00:16:44.081 --> 00:16:49.077\nJavaScript tags in a last name\ndialogue box, it shouldn't happen.\n\n301\n00:16:49.077 --> 00:16:52.590\nI shouldn't have those greater than,\nless than symbols available.\n\n302\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:56.040\nAnd all I had to do is in my\nweb code from my web page.\n\n303\n00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.280\nWhen you click submit or even when you\nlose focus on that particular field.\n\n304\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.370\nJust have it look at the field and\n\n305\n00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.920\nmake sure there's no special\ncharacters in there or\n\n306\n00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.550\nare nothing it's only of a certain length,\nthat it only contains numbers.\n\n307\n00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.100\nBut understand that concept.\n\n308\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.190\nInput validation is making sure that\nthe data that the version is inputting\n\n309\n00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.460\nis valid, is what you are expecting\nbecause I don't want to send\n\n310\n00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:19.760\nunexpected data to a back end, to an\napplication that's gonna process that and\n\n311\n00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.230\ncould cause that application to crash.\n\n312\n00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:26.400\nEither the application crashes or\nit ends up crashing the entire server,\n\n313\n00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.520\ndepending on what type of,\nif they're doing an attack.\n\n314\n00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.090\n&gt;&gt; That would be probably a good\ncase scenario because they're bring\n\n315\n00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.080\nattention to that particular situation.\n\n316\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.510\nBut what if there was no symptom or\nany kind of red flag?\n\n317\n00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.690\nAnd they were just siphoning or\nextracting information?\n\n318\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI wanna know if that stuff is going on.\n\n319\n00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.410\nManual peer reviews is another\nconcept that they call out here.\n\n320\n00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.610\nAnd that's pretty straightforward,\npeer review.\n\n321\n00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.220\nWe have that in several fields,\nnot just this one.\n\n322\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.510\nBut having people in the same field\nlook at your information, in this case,\n\n323\n00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.980\nsoftware development.\n\n324\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.862\nDo I have a good working relationship with\nsome other software developers that we\n\n325\n00:18:03.862 --> 00:18:04.878\ncan kinda swap.\n\n326\n00:18:04.878 --> 00:18:08.040\nIt's like, hey, you look at my code,\nI'll look at your code.\n\n327\n00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.870\nWe kinda help each other out maybe, if\nyou're not in too much competition there.\n\n328\n00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.320\nThat's hard sometimes because a lot\nof times the code is proprietary.\n\n329\n00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.570\nI don't wanna give that information out so\nthat can become a little bit difficult.\n\n330\n00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.450\nBut it's such a good thing,\n\n331\n00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.450\neven if it's between developers\nwithin your own team, right?\n\n332\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.500\nHaving one of your other developers\nexamine the other person's code, and\n\n333\n00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.510\nvice versa.\n\n334\n00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.390\nIt's easy to find things.\n\n335\n00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:36.250\nI know.\n\n336\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.955\nI dabbled in code writing for\na little while and you get so focused and\n\n337\n00:18:39.955 --> 00:18:44.440\nyou're staring at your code and you're\nlike what is wrong I don't see the error,\n\n338\n00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.925\nI have checked it three times everything\nis working right and somebody will walk by\n\n339\n00:18:48.925 --> 00:18:52.500\nand go hey you're missing a semicolon\nat the end of that command.\n\n340\n00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.586\nI'm like,\nfresh eyes my brain was fixing it for\n\n341\n00:18:55.586 --> 00:18:59.956\nme it was ignoring it, fresh eyes on\nthe problem spotted it immediately.\n\n342\n00:18:59.956 --> 00:19:03.142\nSo it's always a good idea\nto get some peer review.\n\n343\n00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:08.385\nAnd Mike ITProTV couldn't agree more with\nthat statement because in fact don't\n\n344\n00:19:08.385 --> 00:19:13.310\nthey set one computer up with two\nseparate monitors and then each story or\n\n345\n00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:17.730\nassignment is assigned to two people for\nthat particular reason?\n\n346\n00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:18.320\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n347\n00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.020\nWe see them over there with monitors\naround so they're facing each other.\n\n348\n00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.060\nThey're constantly working together and\nthat's a great way to do things.\n\n349\n00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.910\nUser acceptance testing is another\none that they call out on the exam.\n\n350\n00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:36.230\nThis is when we,\nit can also be known as beta testing,\n\n351\n00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:40.510\nbut when we wanna make sure that\nthe software that we've written,\n\n352\n00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.270\nthe application,\nwhatever it is actually works.\n\n353\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.730\nAnd I don't mean functionally\nas in it doesn't crash, okay?\n\n354\n00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.660\nThat is the level of testing that we wanna\ndo, we wanna make sure we're putting out\n\n355\n00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.380\na good product but we also wanna do\nthat beta testing or the user acceptance\n\n356\n00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.380\ntesting, where we let the end user use it,\nthe customer, whoever that is.\n\n357\n00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.850\nAnd I say customer.\n\n358\n00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.930\nKeep in mind that if I'm writing\nsomething to use in house,\n\n359\n00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:08.100\nthe firm sales users or\nfor my marketing people.\n\n360\n00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.510\nWell, they are my customer, right?\n\n361\n00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:13.030\nThey're going to be consuming\nthe product that I'm developing.\n\n362\n00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.140\nThey're my customer.\n\n363\n00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.940\nAnd so after I've made sure the product\nworks and it actually doesn't crash and\n\n364\n00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.940\nthings like that.\n\n365\n00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.240\nI take it to them and\nsay I need you to test this.\n\n366\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.250\nDoes it do what you were expecting?\n\n367\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:30.220\nDoes it meet all of our goals set in our\nplanning for this particular project?\n\n368\n00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.520\nAre you happy with the end result?\n\n369\n00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.810\nDoes it do what you need it to do?\n\n370\n00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.710\n&gt;&gt; Well that's what I was going to ask\nMike is if it really is just to be\n\n371\n00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:43.470\nfunctional there or are we asking for\nany kind I of guess\n\n372\n00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:48.590\nintuitive design in looking for that user\ncentric, a GUI and things of that nature.\n\n373\n00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:49.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n374\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.040\nBy letting the, we are,\nby letting the user use it,\n\n375\n00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.190\nthey could do things\nthat you never expected.\n\n376\n00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:58.560\nWhen you develop software, it's really\neasy to get in the mindset of, all right,\n\n377\n00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.730\nthey're gonna type in here and\n\n378\n00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.310\nthey're gonna click this button because\nthat's what I've designed it to do.\n\n379\n00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.060\nAnd you come to find out\nthat they don't do that.\n\n380\n00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.420\nFor some reason they click\nthe button before they type and\n\n381\n00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.570\nI know that's a silly example.\n\n382\n00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.700\nBut they're gonna use it in ways\nyou never designed it to use.\n\n383\n00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.570\nThey're gonna be clicking on things and\ndoing weird stuff with it.\n\n384\n00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.320\nAnd that might cause a problem\nbecause you never thought to test it.\n\n385\n00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.380\nWhoever thought that somebody\nwould've typed a phone number into\n\n386\n00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.980\nthe user name field and clicked submit.\n\n387\n00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.410\nNever even bothered to check.\n\n388\n00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.520\nDoing that fuzzing, the input validation,\nbut watching how the end user uses\n\n389\n00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:35.680\nthe software and, as you say, making sure\nthat it does cuz we develop the software,\n\n390\n00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.870\nnot for me just to say I develop it,\nbut for somebody to actually use.\n\n391\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.750\nAnd if it doesn't meet their needs,\n\n392\n00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.830\nthen my project wasn't laid out\nproperly in the first place or\n\n393\n00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:48.270\nI didn't have a good statement of\npurpose and lay all of that out.\n\n394\n00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.370\nBut I haven't succeeded, right?\n\n395\n00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.080\nI have failed.\n\n396\n00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.050\nMy project has not succeeded\nbecause it is not doing\n\n397\n00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:56.270\nwhat the end user needs it to do.\n\n398\n00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.300\nNow maybe they fail to communicate that\nneed with us back in the beginning,\n\n399\n00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.932\nit's not my fault.\n\n400\n00:22:00.932 --> 00:22:05.920\nNot my fault, so\nwho knows where the problem lies but\n\n401\n00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.790\nwe absolutely do need to test it,\nand as you said,\n\n402\n00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.360\nwhen I test it I mean let\nthe user actually use it.\n\n403\n00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.800\nNot just make sure that they\nclick on it and it opens.\n\n404\n00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.850\nWell that's great.\n\n405\n00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:18.830\nWhat happens when they\nstart trying to use it?\n\n406\n00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:22.720\nThey're on that call with a customer,\nand there's a link to their name so\n\n407\n00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.460\nthey can click on it and\npull up their order history.\n\n408\n00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.120\nBut for some reason,\nit only shows the last two orders, right?\n\n409\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.495\nIt doesn't go back far enough.\n\n410\n00:22:29.495 --> 00:22:31.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be a problem for\n\n411\n00:22:31.085 --> 00:22:32.200\nthat end user, right?\n\n412\n00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.632\n&gt;&gt; I saw this hilarious meme online, Mike.\n\n413\n00:22:34.632 --> 00:22:35.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry,\n\n414\n00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.020\nI have to share it with you guys.\n\n415\n00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.480\nIt was a picture of\nJohnny Depp when he was\n\n416\n00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.338\nJack Sparrow from Pirates\nof the Caribbean.\n\n417\n00:22:43.338 --> 00:22:43.961\n&gt;&gt; Some of my favorites movies.\n\n418\n00:22:43.961 --> 00:22:49.200\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so it said, what\nthe customer was promised, as the caption.\n\n419\n00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.020\n&gt;&gt; And then it said,\nwhat the customer was delivered.\n\n420\n00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.010\nAnd it just had some, I don't know,\n\n421\n00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.632\nraggedy individual with a scarf tied\naround their head and some eyeliner.\n\n422\n00:22:58.632 --> 00:23:00.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not quite Jack Sparrow.\n\n423\n00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.025\n&gt;&gt; Not quite Jack Sparrow.\n\n424\n00:23:02.025 --> 00:23:04.900\n[LAUGH] And that happens sometimes.\n\n425\n00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.430\n&gt;&gt; It does.\nIt absolutely does.\n\n426\n00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.080\nYeah, and hopefully we're doing that.\n\n427\n00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.270\nWe always tease.\n\n428\n00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.260\nIt's like some of these software companies\nuse us as their beta testers, right.\n\n429\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.080\nThey go ahead, put it out to market,\nthey sell it, and then\n\n430\n00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.380\nthey wait to see how many people complain\nor call in the errors to get them fixed.\n\n431\n00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.150\nBut yeah,\nthat is something that we need to do.\n\n432\n00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.100\nThat needs to be part of our\nsoftware development life cycle\n\n433\n00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.660\nis that testing, all right?\n\n434\n00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.910\nStress testing application\nis another important part.\n\n435\n00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.800\nUnderstanding what the application\nis capable of, what it can do, but\n\n436\n00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:40.160\nwhat happens If it experiences a spike,\nright.\n\n437\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.540\nI know that my web app can handle so\n\n438\n00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.277\nmany users per hour or-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe they gain some kind of new\n\n439\n00:23:46.277 --> 00:23:50.236\nviral sensation or popularity and\nyou're like does this app even scale.\n\n440\n00:23:50.236 --> 00:23:53.884\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what's gonna happen is\nthey're gonna crush the whole system.\n\n441\n00:23:53.884 --> 00:23:55.652\nAnd now I'm not gonna get any orders.\n\n442\n00:23:55.652 --> 00:24:00.034\nSo putting the application under heavy\nloads, more than you would ever expect,\n\n443\n00:24:00.034 --> 00:24:01.072\nthat's the idea.\n\n444\n00:24:01.072 --> 00:24:04.699\nI don't wanna say, well, hopefully,\nwe'll have about this many.\n\n445\n00:24:04.699 --> 00:24:05.760\nLet's test that.\n\n446\n00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.329\nWhat happens if you tested for\na 100, but you get 1000?\n\n447\n00:24:09.329 --> 00:24:12.771\nI need to test for 1000.\n\n448\n00:24:12.771 --> 00:24:16.789\nIt might not be a very likely occurrence\nbut we need to test for that just in case.\n\n449\n00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:22.650\nSo doing those type of stress tests,\nand then regression testing.\n\n450\n00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:28.690\nAnother term we need to be familiar with\nis when we talk about regression testing.\n\n451\n00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.540\nWhat we're referring to is you make a fix,\nor\n\n452\n00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.850\nyou add a new feature to an application.\n\n453\n00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.930\nDoes it break anything else, right?\n\n454\n00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.640\nStuff that used to work\nnow no longer works.\n\n455\n00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.020\nWe added this new feature.\n\n456\n00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:44.540\nIt's really cool, but it broke this\nold feature that people still rely on.\n\n457\n00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.746\n&gt;&gt; Does that even happen, Mike?\n\n458\n00:24:45.746 --> 00:24:48.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, never.\n\n459\n00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:52.330\nSo that's what they call,\nagain, regression testing.\n\n460\n00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:57.230\nEvery time a change is made you should\nrun it through tests to make sure\n\n461\n00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.810\nthat it hasn't broken anything else.\n\n462\n00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.590\nTypically with your developers what\nthey'll do is they'll automate a lot of\n\n463\n00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.040\nthese testing procedures.\n\n464\n00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.000\nAnd so it's not like they have to\nrewrite tests every single time.\n\n465\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.970\nThey'll write some tests to test\nthe current functionality of it.\n\n466\n00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.540\nWhen they add something new,\n\n467\n00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:16.300\nthey just add a new test to that\nset of tests that they run.\n\n468\n00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.142\nAnd that still tests all the old stuff,\nand tests the new stuff again.\n\n469\n00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:21.551\nSo as long as you stay on top of this, and\n\n470\n00:25:21.551 --> 00:25:25.874\nit's part of your software development\nlife cycle, it is not as bad.\n\n471\n00:25:25.874 --> 00:25:28.302\nYou can keep up with it\na little bit easier,\n\n472\n00:25:28.302 --> 00:25:31.620\nmaking sure that your tests\ninclude everything you need.\n\n473\n00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.070\nBut, a very important part of that.\n\n474\n00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:36.700\nWhen you make a change to something,\nyeah, have we ever seen this before?\n\n475\n00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.128\nDoes it ever happen?\n\n476\n00:25:39.128 --> 00:25:40.912\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you like that sarcasm, right?\n\n477\n00:25:40.912 --> 00:25:43.709\n&gt;&gt; I did notice a hint of sarcasm there.\n\n478\n00:25:43.709 --> 00:25:47.866\nI'm trying to think of how many times I've\nseen a Microsoft patch come out that's\n\n479\n00:25:47.866 --> 00:25:48.960\npatched something.\n\n480\n00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.918\nAnd then you know the next day\nthere's a patch for the patch or\n\n481\n00:25:51.918 --> 00:25:54.763\nthe next patch cycle there's a patch for\nthe patch right.\n\n482\n00:25:54.763 --> 00:25:58.254\nIt happens, and\nI'm not giving Microsoft a hard time.\n\n483\n00:25:58.254 --> 00:26:03.045\nBut It's,\n&gt;&gt; It really\n\n484\n00:26:03.045 --> 00:26:07.615\ndoesn't even have to be poor coding,\nit's just someone found that loophole or\n\n485\n00:26:07.615 --> 00:26:11.517\njust found a vulnerability and\nbrought it to some elses attention.\n\n486\n00:26:11.517 --> 00:26:15.270\nThat's,\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, what else we have on there?\n\n487\n00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.497\nInput validation, we already talked about.\n\n488\n00:26:17.497 --> 00:26:18.540\nWas the one we jumped to.\n\n489\n00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.230\nAnd then secure coding best practices.\n\n490\n00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.353\nThere are many, many sites you can go to.\n\n491\n00:26:22.353 --> 00:26:26.847\nIf you are getting into software\ndevelopment and you're starting up a team\n\n492\n00:26:26.847 --> 00:26:30.927\nor part of a team or your organization or\nif you wanna pass this exam.\n\n493\n00:26:30.927 --> 00:26:34.596\nYou can definitely go out and\nfind some secure coding best practices.\n\n494\n00:26:34.596 --> 00:26:36.480\nInstitutes like OWASP.\n\n495\n00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.230\nIn fact, let me throw up their website.\n\n496\n00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.156\nGive me a second, Megan.\n\n497\n00:26:39.156 --> 00:26:39.805\n&gt;&gt; Don't throw up.\n\n498\n00:26:39.805 --> 00:26:42.244\n&gt;&gt; OWASP.\n\n499\n00:26:42.244 --> 00:26:46.845\nLet's do there, I thought I\n\n500\n00:26:46.845 --> 00:26:53.000\nbookmarked that page, but silly me.\n\n501\n00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.260\nSecure coding cheat sheet, there we go.\n\n502\n00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.932\nOkay, now you can pull up my screen.\n\n503\n00:27:00.932 --> 00:27:03.770\nThis is OWASP Secure Coding Cheat Sheet.\n\n504\n00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:08.720\nThey have a full document that has\ntheir best practices on there.\n\n505\n00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.830\nI kinda like this one cuz you can\njump down into a particular section.\n\n506\n00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.740\nHey, working on access control.\n\n507\n00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.930\nAll right, let's see what they've got for\n\n508\n00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:18.570\nthe access control cheat sheet,\nwhat is it, what's the policy?\n\n509\n00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.498\nThat one's not all that exciting.\n\n510\n00:27:21.498 --> 00:27:26.300\nBut the idea here is that it's\ngonna give you some best practices.\n\n511\n00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.400\nLet's see if I can find one that\ngives us a little more information.\n\n512\n00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.806\nThere we go.\n\n513\n00:27:30.806 --> 00:27:35.578\nThis is talking about input validation,\nhow to validate a zip code that\n\n514\n00:27:35.578 --> 00:27:40.206\nshould contain five digits,\nplus an optional four digits, right?\n\n515\n00:27:40.206 --> 00:27:42.054\nHere in the states, we do that.\n\n516\n00:27:42.054 --> 00:27:46.050\nHow do I validate US state\nselection from a drop down menu?\n\n517\n00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:51.520\nSo some great examples here on\nhow we can do best practices,\n\n518\n00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.270\nsome good help,\nespecially if you're just getting started.\n\n519\n00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.600\nAlso SANS has great information.\n\n520\n00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.320\nLet's see if I bookmarked\nthat one as well.\n\n521\n00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:04.125\nChecklist and step by step guides\n\n522\n00:28:04.125 --> 00:28:09.646\nare fantastic for where was there one for\n\n523\n00:28:09.646 --> 00:28:15.828\nsoftware development, web applications.\n\n524\n00:28:15.828 --> 00:28:20.449\nWeb applications check sheet, that's\ntheir Word doc, let's get their pdf here.\n\n525\n00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:23.490\nNow here's their\nWeb Applications Security Checklist.\n\n526\n00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:24.500\nAnd so we can go through.\n\n527\n00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.159\nOops, I kind of scrolled\na little fast there.\n\n528\n00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.093\nEnsure the Java app is sandboxed.\n\n529\n00:28:29.093 --> 00:28:35.190\nEnsure the Java.security and ACL and\ninterfaces packages are run.\n\n530\n00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.490\nA lot of examples of the code\nthat you should write.\n\n531\n00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:43.270\nSo there's resources out there to help you\ndevelop software development lifecycle,\n\n532\n00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.140\nsecure software development lifecycles.\n\n533\n00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.081\nCenter for\nInternet Security is another one.\n\n534\n00:28:52.081 --> 00:28:54.510\nWe got that down here.\n\n535\n00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.220\nThese guys have some\nreal good information.\n\n536\n00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.217\nBenchmarks, these are fantastic.\n\n537\n00:29:00.217 --> 00:29:01.367\nLike, I looked up one.\n\n538\n00:29:01.367 --> 00:29:02.600\nLet's just pull one up here.\n\n539\n00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.198\nInternet Explorer.\n\n540\n00:29:03.198 --> 00:29:04.970\nWindows 10, there we go.\n\n541\n00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.458\nSee what their PDF has to say.\n\n542\n00:29:06.458 --> 00:29:09.181\nWe're gonna open that up.\n\n543\n00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:12.176\nAnd so, this is your center for\nInternet security.\n\n544\n00:29:12.176 --> 00:29:16.357\nWindows 10 Enterprise Release\n1511 Benchmark.\n\n545\n00:29:16.357 --> 00:29:21.190\nAll right, and what this is gonna\ngive me is recommendations, right?\n\n546\n00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.849\nPassword policy,\nwhat you should go and look at.\n\n547\n00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:25.570\nAll right, that's actually.\n\n548\n00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:26.580\nLet's see.\nEnsure,\n\n549\n00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.780\nenforce password history is set to 24 or\nmore passwords.\n\n550\n00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.926\nProfile applicability, if I can say that.\n\n551\n00:29:32.926 --> 00:29:34.127\nLevel 1.\n\n552\n00:29:34.127 --> 00:29:36.032\nIt gives you a little bit\nof a description for it.\n\n553\n00:29:36.032 --> 00:29:37.040\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n554\n00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.450\n&gt;&gt; Recommended why you would do this.\n\n555\n00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.810\nHow to check, right?\n\n556\n00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.940\nHow to audit and make sure that\nthe setting is configured properly.\n\n557\n00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.877\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna send me that link?\n\n558\n00:29:44.877 --> 00:29:45.478\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n559\n00:29:45.478 --> 00:29:46.591\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n560\n00:29:46.591 --> 00:29:47.790\n&gt;&gt; The impact is.\n\n561\n00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:52.210\nIf this isn't set,\nwhat the default value normally is, right?\n\n562\n00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:55.340\nAnd we keep going down,\nensure maximum password age,\n\n563\n00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.900\nso a lot of password settings.\n\n564\n00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.963\nLet's jump way down and\nsee what else we can find.\n\n565\n00:30:00.963 --> 00:30:05.141\nEnsure MSS (NoNameReleaseOnDemand)\nallows the computer to ignore NetBIOS\n\n566\n00:30:05.141 --> 00:30:09.490\nname releases requests, except from\nWINS servers Is set to enabled.\n\n567\n00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:10.372\nSomething I wouldn't have thought of.\n\n568\n00:30:10.372 --> 00:30:14.593\nIt was a thing that I need to go and check\nand make sure that this is included in\n\n569\n00:30:14.593 --> 00:30:18.555\nour baseline and that we're using\npolicy to configure this setting.\n\n570\n00:30:18.555 --> 00:30:21.186\nIt tells me it's the default\nconfiguration so there's no impact so\n\n571\n00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:22.165\nwe're good to go there.\n\n572\n00:30:22.165 --> 00:30:25.437\nPhew, I was getting worried there.\n\n573\n00:30:25.437 --> 00:30:32.321\nThe idea is that again, this is if you're\ntrying to get your baseline started.\n\n574\n00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:34.292\nWe're talking about\nbaseline in this respect,\n\n575\n00:30:34.292 --> 00:30:37.511\nwe're saying that these are the baseline\nsettings that need to be configured on\n\n576\n00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:39.480\nall of our Windows 10 clients.\n\n577\n00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.880\nThese are the baseline settings that must\nbe configured on all new servers that we\n\n578\n00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.190\nroll out.\n\n579\n00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:45.909\nWe can try to come up\nwith those on our own.\n\n580\n00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:50.367\nBut there are organizations like\nthis that have the experience,\n\n581\n00:30:50.367 --> 00:30:55.973\nhave the massive amounts of data from\nseveral customers that put these together.\n\n582\n00:30:55.973 --> 00:31:00.200\nAnd then basically give you almost like\na checklist that you can go down through.\n\n583\n00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:06.493\nSo a really good resource to help you\ncreate those benchmarks for your systems.\n\n584\n00:31:06.493 --> 00:31:08.140\nSo a lot of information there.\n\n585\n00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:13.760\nWe talked about application security and\njust making sure that security\n\n586\n00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.710\nis a part of your software development\nlifecycle from the very beginning.\n\n587\n00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.984\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike, and\nnow I can take all my great ideas and\n\n588\n00:31:20.984 --> 00:31:25.908\nsee them through application fruition,\nor at least I know where to start now.\n\n589\n00:31:25.908 --> 00:31:27.950\nSo thank you, I appreciate that.\n\n590\n00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.961\nAnd thank you ladies and gentlemen for\ntuning in today, but that does go ahead\n\n591\n00:31:31.961 --> 00:31:35.678\nand meet the end of our show here, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n592\n00:31:35.678 --> 00:31:37.997\n&gt;&gt;

everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.660\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.890\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.700\nAnd in today's episode we're back\nwith more on our CSA+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.060\nAnd, of course, joining us in the studio\nyet again to lend his expertise on that\n\n10\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.130\ntopic our good friend,\nour mentor, Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.820\nMike welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.440\n&gt;&gt; It's going great,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.280\nGlad to be here, excited as always.\n\n14\n00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.260\nSo in this episode we're gonna to be\nlooking at some of the different tools\n\n15\n00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.540\nthat we have available for\nus as cyber security professionals.\n\n16\n00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.770\nAnd I wanna read you the CompTia\nobjective here for this one.\n\n17\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.020\nCompare and contrast the general purpose.\n\n18\n00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.670\nAnd reason for using various cyber\nsecurity tools and technologies.\n\n19\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.160\nAnd then the objectives proceed\nto list out several tools.\n\n20\n00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.500\nSo what I wanna do is kinda go through\nthe different categories that CompTIA\n\n21\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.010\nhas laid out and talk about some of the\ntools that are in each of the categories.\n\n22\n00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.990\nAnd really talk about where I would I use\nthese, why I would want to go out and\n\n23\n00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.040\nget one of these, where I would end up,\n\n24\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.290\nwhat is the reason for\nwanting one of these tools.\n\n25\n00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.840\nAnd then compare a couple of tools within\nthat category although what you'll see\n\n26\n00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.480\nis that most of them within a category,\nthat's why they're in a category together,\n\n27\n00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.010\nbecause they do the same thing, or\nthey have the same general purpose.\n\n28\n00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.630\nOne's going to have a few more bells and\nwhistles than the other.\n\n29\n00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.250\nOne might be free, one is not.\n\n30\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.720\nSo there's differences there, but in\ngeneral, they're gonna do the same thing.\n\n31\n00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.850\nSo let's start out by, let's see,\nour first category is preventative.\n\n32\n00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.020\nSo, types of tools that we can use in\ncyber security as preventative measures.\n\n33\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.210\nAnd what do we mean by preventative tools?\n\n34\n00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.230\nThese are tools that I would\nuse before we're compromised,\n\n35\n00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.880\nright, before anything bad happens.\n\n36\n00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.580\nThese are tools that I'm\ngonna try to use to prevent\n\n37\n00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.890\nthings like that from happening.\n\n38\n00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.140\nSo these are proactive tools\nrather than reacted right.\n\n39\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.370\nThese are things that when\nI'm setting up my network or\n\n40\n00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.460\nwhen I'm coming in and saying, hey,\nlook we are gonna make our network secure.\n\n41\n00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.000\nThese are tools that I'm\ngonna use to help do that,\n\n42\n00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.710\nto help keep my network secure\nbefore bad things happen.\n\n43\n00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.530\nSo what kinds of things\nare we looking at here?\n\n44\n00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.820\nOne would be intrusion detection systems\nand intrusion prevention systems.\n\n45\n00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.900\nIDS, Intrusion Detection System and\nthen IPS, Intrusion Prevention Systems.\n\n46\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.430\nThe difference is subtle, but at the same\ntime, a very big difference, right?\n\n47\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.795\nCuz they sound similar, right?\n\n48\n00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:40.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Intrusion detection,\n\n49\n00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.610\nintrusion prevention?\n\n50\n00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.437\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting because they both have\nthe same engine in which to identify that\n\n51\n00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:48.090\nthe threat has occurred, right.\n\n52\n00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.120\nBut one is just gonna go, you can set\nit up for an email or a messages,\n\n53\n00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.500\nSMS message maybe, something like that,\ntypically email, to let you know,\n\n54\n00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.450\nhey, an event has occurred,\nyou may want to check that out.\n\n55\n00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.600\nAnd there's gonna be logs\nassociated with that.\n\n56\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.230\nBut when it comes to IPS,\nit says I see what you are doing there and\n\n57\n00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.040\nI don't like it and it actually tries\nto stop the threat from occurring.\n\n58\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely it's almost\nlike having another person working\n\n59\n00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.540\nfor you on staff.\n\n60\n00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.390\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; Somebody that can react before you get\n\n61\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.819\na chance to so that's it,\nDaniel nailed it on the head there.\n\n62\n00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.270\nIntrusion detection detects intrusions but\nit doesn't do anything about it.\n\n63\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.210\nIt's considered a passive system and\n\n64\n00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.090\nreally, that's what we started with,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.578\nIf you go way back in the day before\nthe tools were being developed,\n\n66\n00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.244\nthat was the first thing we had, was hey,\n\n67\n00:03:33.244 --> 00:03:36.130\nwe need something that can\nalert me of anomalous behavior.\n\n68\n00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.720\nStrange behavior of behavior\nthat indicates or is indicative\n\n69\n00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.260\nof some type of attack, right,\nthat was our intrusion detection systems.\n\n70\n00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.930\nAnd that was great,\n\n71\n00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.400\nbecause at least we wold be made aware\nof something that was happening.\n\n72\n00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.970\nAnd then we could go check it out.\n\n73\n00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.730\nBut as Daniel said, it was in the form\nusually of an alert sent to you,\n\n74\n00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.550\nmaybe a pop up on your screen.\n\n75\n00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.180\nMaybe an email, a text,\nan SMS, something like that.\n\n76\n00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.860\nTo alert you or\na group of people about an event.\n\n77\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.180\nAnd then you'd have to go and find out.\n\n78\n00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.010\nBut it was very, it was after-the-fact.\n\n79\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.760\nThe activity had already occurred and\nnow we gonna go check it out.\n\n80\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.400\nWhereas in intrusion prevention,\nas Daniel said, Is active.\n\n81\n00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.780\nIt does something about it or it can\nbe configured to do something about it.\n\n82\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.240\nAnd like Daniel said,\nit is basically the same detection.\n\n83\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.520\nIt's just what happens after we detected\nthat intrusion detection, I'm sorry,\n\n84\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.670\nthe intrusion prevention,\ncan shut down ports.\n\n85\n00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.710\nFollow band width, depending on what\nproduct you're using, it can do a lot of\n\n86\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.880\ncool things to try to mitigate\nthe effectiveness of the attack or\n\n87\n00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.810\nwhatever the malicious activity that's\noccurring to try to slow that down and\n\n88\n00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.100\nkeep it from,\nat least keep it from spreading.\n\n89\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.680\nIt might have detected it as it\nwas infecting in the system.\n\n90\n00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.060\nAnd that system started\nthe CPU cycles on that system\n\n91\n00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.060\nsky rocketed well above the baseline.\n\n92\n00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.530\nNetwork bandwidth coming out of that\nmachine was well out of the normal range.\n\n93\n00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.840\nAnd then my intrusion prevention system\nsaid, something's going on here,\n\n94\n00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.120\nthis isn't right.\n\n95\n00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.420\nLet me shut the switch down and\n\n96\n00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.050\nprevent that node from communicating\nwith the rest of the network.\n\n97\n00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.290\nThat node's already infected but\n\n98\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.040\nit keeps the rest of the network\nfrom getting infected, all right?\n\n99\n00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.600\nSome of the ones you would see here,\n\n100\n00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.410\nI guess some other terminology\nwe should throw in.\n\n101\n00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.100\nIt's not actually on this list but\npart of it is, part of it is and\n\n102\n00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.065\nI don't understand.\n\n103\n00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:23.879\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we do need to make sure we\n\n104\n00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:30.130\nunderstand that there are NIDSs,\nNIPSs, HIPSS and HIDSS, right.\n\n105\n00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.740\nWhat's that gonna throw at you.\n\n106\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.350\nIt's straight forward though.\n\n107\n00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.247\nYou've got host-based\nintrusion detection and\n\n108\n00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:38.040\nyou've got network-based\nintrusion detection systems.\n\n109\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.591\nYou've got host-based intrusion\nprevention systems and\n\n110\n00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:43.180\nnetwork-based intrusion prevention system.\n\n111\n00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.380\nAnd a host-based is designed\nto protect a single machine.\n\n112\n00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.748\nYou run it all on a host and to protect\nthat machine and that machine only.\n\n113\n00:05:51.748 --> 00:05:55.340\nWhereas a network-based would be\nput typically in line somewhere in\n\n114\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.440\nthe network, usually out towards\nthe front of your network where it can\n\n115\n00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.230\nsee all the traffic coming in.\n\n116\n00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.780\nBut it definitely can have more\nthan one sensor hooked up to it for\n\n117\n00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.310\ndifferent locations and it monitors\nthe entire network for malicious behavior.\n\n118\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.670\nSo that's the difference between\nnetwork-based and host-based.\n\n119\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.300\nSome examples, intrusion prevention\nsystem you have Sourcefire,\n\n120\n00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.670\nits one that's been around for\na long time.\n\n121\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:25.740\nIn fact, the gentleman that develop\nSnort which is also on our list,\n\n122\n00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.820\ndevelop Sourcefire.\n\n123\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.520\nIt's gotta a long history,\nI don't have it memorized.\n\n124\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.340\nIf you're really curious,\nyou could go out to Wikipedia, but\n\n125\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.150\nit's not gonna be on the exam.\n\n126\n00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.830\nBut Snort was free, developed by,\nand I can't remember the guy's name.\n\n127\n00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.845\nBut he developed Sourcefire, who then\nwas bought out by Cisco in 2013 for\n\n128\n00:06:43.845 --> 00:06:46.120\n$2.7 billion.\n\n129\n00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.960\n&gt;&gt; With the b?\n\n130\n00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.260\n&gt;&gt; With the B.\n\n131\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo\n\n132\n00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.400\nyou can see they plan of making\na lot of money with that.\n\n133\n00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.085\nSo back in 2013, Cisco acquire sourcefire.\n\n134\n00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:00.685\nAnd some of you might be running\nthis now in your network.\n\n135\n00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:01.265\nIf you look at your,\n\n136\n00:07:01.265 --> 00:07:05.655\nwhat they call the next generation\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n137\n00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:08.960\nThe Cisco created was called firepower.\n\n138\n00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.000\nIf we now here we can actually\ngo out to their website and\n\n139\n00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.473\ntake a peek if we wanted.\n\n140\n00:07:13.473 --> 00:07:15.555\nI will try to pull up\nsome of these as we go,\n\n141\n00:07:15.555 --> 00:07:19.556\nbut, again this is just really\nnot gonna be a testable thing.\n\n142\n00:07:19.556 --> 00:07:23.720\nBut Cisco has their Next-Generation\nIntrusion Prevention Systems.We\n\n143\n00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.350\ntake a look here at some of their\nfirepowers and these are again,\n\n144\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.790\nwhat sourcefire kind of evolved into.\n\n145\n00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:31.290\nRight.\n\n146\n00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.590\nSnort, we've actually already seen.\n\n147\n00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.450\nI think we've done a demo of Snort.\n\n148\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.270\nIf not, we will.\n\n149\n00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.400\nSnort is open source.\n\n150\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:42.910\nIt's free.\n\n151\n00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.240\nIt is another, it can be either.\n\n152\n00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.260\nAnd a lot of these can, keep that in mind\ntoo, there's a little bit of a gray line.\n\n153\n00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.700\nLike Snort, for example.\n\n154\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.105\nYou can set this up as intrusion\ndetection or intrusion prevention.\n\n155\n00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:57.521\nIf you remember in our little exercise\nthat we did with Snort, we used it\n\n156\n00:07:57.521 --> 00:08:03.480\nas a way to capture Any ICP packets that\nwere coming in to that particular host,\n\n157\n00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.270\nwe're basically using as a host-based\nintrusion detection system.\n\n158\n00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.690\nBut you could configure it as either.\n\n159\n00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.540\nIs it going to be active or\nis it going to be passive?\n\n160\n00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.480\nBro is another one.\n\n161\n00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.000\nGot a great name, right?\n\n162\n00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.460\nWhat's up, Bro?\n\n163\n00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.010\nLet's go to\nthe Bro Network Security Monitor.\n\n164\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.460\nAnd this is just www.bro.org.\n\n165\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.070\nThis is another network analysis\nframework, as they like to put it there.\n\n166\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.160\nIt does a lot.\n\n167\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.390\nIt actually can do some forensics and\nthat's really what I'm seeing lately,\n\n168\n00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:38.495\nDaniel, is these tools they're\nbecoming multipurpose.\n\n169\n00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:39.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Unified threat management\n\n170\n00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.110\ntype systems where it's no longer I have\n&gt;&gt; And intrusion detection system.\n\n171\n00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.930\nAnd I have a sys log system and\nI have something else.\n\n172\n00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.830\nThey're all kind of\ncombined into one nowadays.\n\n173\n00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.400\n&gt;&gt; They're making the game too easy Mike.\n\n174\n00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.280\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n\n175\n00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.060\nAnd that has its pros and cons.\n\n176\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think we've talked about that.\n\n177\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.300\nWe've said how these unified systems\nare great because you've got one user\n\n178\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.510\ninterface to deal with.\n\n179\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:07.680\nYou learn that console and you can\nmanage of all of your security systems.\n\n180\n00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.630\nWhich is good the bad downside is if that\never goes down or is unavailable for\n\n181\n00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.840\nsome reason you can lose a lot\nmore then just one system.\n\n182\n00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.040\nSo it can end up we talk\nabout layers of defense but\n\n183\n00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.370\nif all those layers are tied\nto one appliance and\n\n184\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.360\nthat appliance fails I didn't lose one\nlayer I've lost several layers of defense.\n\n185\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.040\nSo that is something to consider but\nof course we're gonna put fault\n\n186\n00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.060\ntolerance in there So\nthose are just some general examples, or\n\n187\n00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.270\nsome examples of intrusion\nprevention systems.\n\n188\n00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.940\nImage and host based intrusion prevention,\njust be familiar with that term as well.\n\n189\n00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.410\nOne or the other, do I run one or\nthe other, do I choose network based vs.\n\n190\n00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.310\nhost based?\n\n191\n00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.270\nNo, in fact a lot of\norganizations will run\n\n192\n00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.250\nnever faced intrusion prevention\nsystems to protect the entire network.\n\n193\n00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:56.500\nBut then, on the sensitive hosts, the ones\nthat have data that I have to protect for\n\n194\n00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.630\nregulatory reasons, or\njust super sensitive,\n\n195\n00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.970\nor if this kind of data is the crown\njewels of the organization.\n\n196\n00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.620\nIf it gets out,\nour business could go under.\n\n197\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.470\nIntellectual properties, stuff like that.\n\n198\n00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.280\nMaybe I run host based intrusion\nprevention on that individual host.\n\n199\n00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.190\nSo, another layer of defense, right?\n\n200\n00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.080\nIf anything was to make it past\nmy network intrusion prevention,\n\n201\n00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.310\nthe alarms on the system itself would kick\noff and warn me of the attack, right?\n\n202\n00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:27.340\nOther types of preventative tools we need\nto be familiar with, firewalls, right?\n\n203\n00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.320\nFirewalls are a,\n\n204\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.770\nI don't know of any network that doesn't\nrun a firewall I can't think of any.\n\n205\n00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.560\nI don't know why they would.\n\n206\n00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.630\nIt's a pretty common technology nowadays.\n\n207\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.210\nAnd again, sometimes it's combined\nwith other technologies but remember,\n\n208\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.220\na firewall,\nthink back to your Network+ days, right?\n\n209\n00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.330\nA firewall is a way that I can\nfilter traffic at the port level,\n\n210\n00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.540\nand we can allow or\ndeny certain traffic from coming in.\n\n211\n00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.000\nWe have to keep in mind that\nthere's 65,535 ports, and\n\n212\n00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.440\neach one of those is\nbasically a doorway in.\n\n213\n00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.060\nWhat a firewall is gonna is close all\nthose doors and then we get to pick and\n\n214\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.230\nchoose what doors are gonna be open.\n\n215\n00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.650\nAnd then, depending on the level of the\nfirewall it might do packet inspection.\n\n216\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.340\nIt might let me look at\nthe content of the packets.\n\n217\n00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.380\nThey can actually keep me safe from\nseveral types of attacks like we used to\n\n218\n00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.570\ntalk about in security classes,\nsimplex right,\n\n219\n00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.220\nwhere we would do send requests.\n\n220\n00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.740\nIf you remember the TCP handshake,\nthe three way handshake, send,\n\n221\n00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.380\nwhich is responded with\nwith a synac packet,\n\n222\n00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.310\nan acknowledgement of the synchronization\nrequest, and then a request for\n\n223\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.440\nsynchronization from itself and\nthen, a final ACK would go back.\n\n224\n00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.730\nSo SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK,\nthe three-way handshake.\n\n225\n00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.790\nAnd then, you've got a TCP connection.And\none of the old attacks that they would do\n\n226\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.870\nis, you would send the SYN packet, the\nserver would send back the SYN-ACK, but\n\n227\n00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.120\nyou'd never send back\nthe final ACK packet.\n\n228\n00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.550\nSo, it was basically\na half-open connection.\n\n229\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.270\nIt's sitting there waiting for\nyou to finish that connection.\n\n230\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.540\nWhile it's waiting you start another\nconnection, and another connection, and\n\n231\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.440\nanother connection, and\na server only has so\n\n232\n00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.920\nmuch memory to hold these half open\nconnections waiting for a reply.\n\n233\n00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.480\nThese firewalls now will\nfinish the connection for you.\n\n234\n00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.500\nThey'll go ahead and say okay I saw the\nsynac come out, I'm going to go ahead and\n\n235\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.410\nsend an ack packet back to the server.\n\n236\n00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.560\nEven though I didn't send it,\nit's acking for me.\n\n237\n00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.470\nBecause the act that I do send back,\n\n238\n00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.260\nif it's a legitimate request,\nis just ignored.\n\n239\n00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.300\nIt's an acknowledgement that's\nalready been acknowledged, and\n\n240\n00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.860\nit doesn't cause any problems.\n\n241\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.320\nIf it was an attack, the routers or\nthe firewalls already act, and\n\n242\n00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.530\nthere is no half open\nconnection sitting there.\n\n243\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.610\nSo, those kind of attacks\nare not as effective anymore,\n\n244\n00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.380\nbecause of devices like these.\n\n245\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.470\nWho are the big players\nin the firewall industry?\n\n246\n00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.380\nFirst one that comes to mind\nis probably Cisco, right?\n\n247\n00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They've held that place quite a while.\n\n248\n00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.900\nPalo Alto is another one.\n\n249\n00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.000\nCheck Point would be another one.\n\n250\n00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.880\n&gt;&gt; pfSense?\n\n251\n00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.470\n&gt;&gt; pfSince.\n\n252\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.130\nYeah, I was gonna say if you're\nlooking for something that's free.\n\n253\n00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.970\nThey do have a pay version as well where\nyou can buy some hardware problem.\n\n254\n00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:00.840\nBut a variable.\n\n255\n00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.730\nIn fact we use it here.\n\n256\n00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:08.760\nSeveral of our hosts, entertainers,\nworkers, will run pfSense at home as well.\n\n257\n00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.910\nIt's a really good one to run.\n\n258\n00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.700\nSo, those are your firewalls.\n\n259\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.880\nAnd then, they mention antivirus.\n\n260\n00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:22.300\nThis would definitely fall under\nthe preventative category of tools.\n\n261\n00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:27.100\nBecause we're hoping to catch viruses\nbefore they infect our system.\n\n262\n00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.880\nAnd obviously very important that we run,\n\n263\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.610\nthis is probably nothing new\nto anybody out there, but\n\n264\n00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:36.520\nit is important to make sure we're running\nantivirus software, especially nowadays.\n\n265\n00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.580\nI remember, Daniel,\nyou go back probably as far as I do.\n\n266\n00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:46.770\nI remember not running antivirus\nsoftware because I knew that I was,\n\n267\n00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.600\nin my mind at least,\nI was smart about my browsing practices.\n\n268\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.950\nI went to trusted sites.\n\n269\n00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.070\nI didn't click on anything\nthat I didn't trust.\n\n270\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.482\nI didn't go to sites with skulls and\ncrossbones in their logo.\n\n271\n00:13:58.482 --> 00:14:00.943\nNot that there's anything wrong with\nthat if any of you have skulls and\n\n272\n00:14:00.943 --> 00:14:01.910\ncrossbones in your logos.\n\n273\n00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:08.040\nBut, I was relatively safe about what I\nwas doing when I was out there surfing.\n\n274\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.840\nSo, I didn't feel that the resource\nutilization from those early anti-virus\n\n275\n00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.700\nproducts what was worth it?\n\n276\n00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.880\nI wasn't worried about it.\n\n277\n00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.800\nBut now with drive-bys,\nwhere you can get a malware infection\n\n278\n00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.040\njust by visiting a site and\nnot clicking on anything, scary times.\n\n279\n00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.570\nSo you have to be running\nantivirus software.\n\n280\n00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:31.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I actually saw people get\ndrive-by downloads of malware through\n\n281\n00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:32.950\na car dealership.\n\n282\n00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.350\nIt was a legit,\nhuge car dealership here in North Florida.\n\n283\n00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.880\nMassive.\n\n284\n00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.390\nIt was a Toyota dealership.\n\n285\n00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.510\nBut, they have ads that\nrun down the sidebars and\n\n286\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.840\nthey don't know where that comes from.\n\n287\n00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.390\nRight?\n\n288\n00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.210\nAnd those ads were allowing people,\nand people were going to\n\n289\n00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.910\nwhatever Toyota of Jacksonville or\nsomething and they were getting infected.\n\n290\n00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.864\nI was having to remediate\nthose infections and\n\n291\n00:14:52.864 --> 00:14:55.490\nsay don't go to Toyota Jacksonville\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n292\n00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.190\n&gt;&gt; Because one of their ads has got\n\n293\n00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.260\nmalware, and then people, my users are\nsaying, well I'm not doing anything wrong,\n\n294\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.300\nI'm not visiting sites that\nwould lend me to have a problem.\n\n295\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.310\nI go, I know,\nthis is the day in which we live.\n\n296\n00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.160\nYou connect to the Internet,\n\n297\n00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.210\nyou've got to expect problems, you have\nto have protection against these things.\n\n298\n00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:16.440\nGood news is we have antivirus\nsystems on your computer\n\n299\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.760\nthat stop these things from infecting\nyou but they're still trying to happen.\n\n300\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n301\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.500\nEnd-users try to turn them off sometimes\nbecause one of their friends or\n\n302\n00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.570\nnephews has told them yeah, it will speed\nup your machine if you turn that off.\n\n303\n00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.380\nSo yeah,\nwe gotta make sure we're running that.\n\n304\n00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.510\nAntivirus, anti-malware.\n\n305\n00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.260\nNow, let's do compare and\ncontrast a little bit there.\n\n306\n00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.180\nJust be careful with that terminology.\n\n307\n00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.980\nRemember, antivirus software, well, again,\n\n308\n00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.360\nthis is another one that\nhas changed over time.\n\n309\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.270\nInitially, antivirus\nwas really focused on.\n\n310\n00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:49.394\nViruses and worms and\nnot things like spyware and adware,\n\n311\n00:15:49.394 --> 00:15:51.761\nthose were considered viruses.\n\n312\n00:15:51.761 --> 00:15:56.441\nSo, you had your anti malware software\nmalware bite still one of my favorites\n\n313\n00:15:56.441 --> 00:16:01.066\nthat I use, I've never sever others that\nwere freely available that you could run.\n\n314\n00:16:01.066 --> 00:16:03.894\n&gt;&gt; Spybot\n&gt;&gt; Spybot, search and destroy, yeah.\n\n315\n00:16:03.894 --> 00:16:06.515\nThese are ones of your run\nalong side your antivirus,\n\n316\n00:16:06.515 --> 00:16:09.146\nbecause your antivirus keeps\nyou safe from viruses.\n\n317\n00:16:09.146 --> 00:16:12.500\nBut this would just keep you safe from\nan ad where a pop up things like that.\n\n318\n00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.370\n&gt;&gt; Interesting story.\n\n319\n00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:17.168\nThis is a little random\nabout these types of things.\n\n320\n00:16:17.168 --> 00:16:22.823\nAs malware becomes more and more adaptive\nto these anti-malware systems, right?\n\n321\n00:16:22.823 --> 00:16:24.610\nEverybody's trying to keep up.\n\n322\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:30.880\nWhat's funny is, they still sometimes\nuse older engines just as a platform.\n\n323\n00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.340\nWhere they'll get around this product or\nthat product which is new and\n\n324\n00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.370\ncutting edge.\n\n325\n00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.480\nBut I would have to use older\nproducts that they weren't\n\n326\n00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.540\nactively trying to block to get at them.\n\n327\n00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.590\nAnd at least break it in some ways, so\n\n328\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.970\nthat I could get them to stop\nblocking the modern tool.\n\n329\n00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:47.965\nSo, just because it's an older tool,\n\n330\n00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:49.332\ndoesn't mean you shouldn't\nhave it in you tool kit.\n\n331\n00:16:49.332 --> 00:16:51.220\nIt saved my bacon quite a few times.\n\n332\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.647\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's very good point.\n\n333\n00:16:52.647 --> 00:16:56.566\nSometimes they forget about protecting\nagainst or it's the bad guy like when I'm\n\n334\n00:16:56.566 --> 00:16:59.760\nwriting my stuff and I'm testing\nit to make sure it's gonna work.\n\n335\n00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.445\nI didn't even think about testing it\nagainst Spybot- Search &amp; Destroy to see if\n\n336\n00:17:03.445 --> 00:17:04.921\nit would do something about it.\n\n337\n00:17:04.921 --> 00:17:07.740\nSo, very cool.\nBut, yes, so now, anti malware,\n\n338\n00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:12.419\nagain, is really covers the full\ngamut typically from your Adware,\n\n339\n00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:16.390\nall the way to your worms and\ntrojans and things like that.\n\n340\n00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.354\nBut then again, so\ndoes most of your anti-virus.\n\n341\n00:17:18.354 --> 00:17:21.902\nSo, just use your, I think you guys,\ncan figure that one out.\n\n342\n00:17:21.902 --> 00:17:24.295\nThey're pretty much synonymous there.\n\n343\n00:17:24.295 --> 00:17:27.920\nSome examples of, I don't know,\nDaniel, what do you run for\n\n344\n00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.970\nanti-virus software nowadays?\n\n345\n00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.000\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's probably,\nSymantec is good.\n\n346\n00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.120\nI like Symantec.\n\n347\n00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.520\nI also like Kaspersky,\nI think it's a fantastic product.\n\n348\n00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.172\nIt works really well.\n\n349\n00:17:37.172 --> 00:17:40.614\nI know there's some trust factor,\nbecause of its origins, but\n\n350\n00:17:40.614 --> 00:17:43.494\nI have not had any problems with it and\nit works great.\n\n351\n00:17:43.494 --> 00:17:45.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n352\n00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.410\nI have a great screen saver from them,\nwhere it's got the map of the globe-\n\n353\n00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.658\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, super awesome, yeah.\n\n354\n00:17:48.658 --> 00:17:52.056\n&gt;&gt; It gives you RealTime,\nrelatively, RealTime information.\n\n355\n00:17:52.056 --> 00:17:54.495\nBut, yeah, so Symantec.\n\n356\n00:17:54.495 --> 00:17:56.180\nThere's another one.\n\n357\n00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.400\nA great thing about like a Windows\noperating system, for example,\n\n358\n00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.660\nit now has anti-malware software\nbuilt into it out of the box.\n\n359\n00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.264\nYou've got your,\nwhat's now known as Windows Defender,\n\n360\n00:18:05.264 --> 00:18:07.252\nwhich has gone through several iterations.\n\n361\n00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:10.357\nIn fact, that was one when you had\nMicrosoft Security Essentials that was\n\n362\n00:18:10.357 --> 00:18:13.583\ndoing your viruses and you had Windows\nDefender that was doing your adware.\n\n363\n00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:16.354\nAnd then,\nthey kind of combined those and now,\n\n364\n00:18:16.354 --> 00:18:19.000\nit's Windows Defender that handles it all.\n\n365\n00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.700\nSo, built right into\nyour operating system.\n\n366\n00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.820\nNo reason you shouldn't be running\none if you're running Windows.\n\n367\n00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.391\nNothing to say, you can't go out and\nget other software.\n\n368\n00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:30.276\nWindows Defender, if it detects any\nother anti-malware software running,\n\n369\n00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:31.071\nit will it will stop.\n\n370\n00:18:31.071 --> 00:18:33.310\nThey won't try to compete with it.\n\n371\n00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.106\nOtherwise, Microsoft will\nget in trouble for that.\n\n372\n00:18:35.106 --> 00:18:38.647\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Speaking of Microsoft,\n\n373\n00:18:38.647 --> 00:18:43.810\nanother one is the EMET, the Enhanced\nMitigation Experience Toolkit.\n\n374\n00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.313\nAnd I will say, that this is one that\nI don't have a lot of experience with.\n\n375\n00:18:46.313 --> 00:18:51.500\nAnd unfortunately,\nit's actually going out of service.\n\n376\n00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.070\nIt was supposed to end.\n\n377\n00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.170\nThey were gonna end support for\nthis January of this year.\n\n378\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.810\nMicrosoft lawyers,\nwere not gonna support it anymore.\n\n379\n00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.330\nWe've got other technologies in place.\n\n380\n00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.250\nYou don't really need this anymore.\n\n381\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.409\nBut they've got a big\noutpouring from the community.\n\n382\n00:19:05.409 --> 00:19:09.610\nThey said, give us a little more time to\nfind another solution or move off of that.\n\n383\n00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:10.590\nAnd so, Microsoft did.\n\n384\n00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.940\nI think they're giving\nit 'til July of 2018.\n\n385\n00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.590\nThey'll continue support for EMET, but\n\n386\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.790\nafter that there is we\nare not gonna support it.\n\n387\n00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.680\nThey also said that Windows 10,\nthe next iteration of Windows 10,\n\n388\n00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.700\nmight not support it either.\n\n389\n00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.900\nSo, you might come here one day and\n\n390\n00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.820\nfind that an update occurred on Windows\n10 and it just, no longer will run.\n\n391\n00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.960\nSo, something to keep in mind,\nbut know the name.\n\n392\n00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.850\nJust in case it pops up on the exam,\nthat acronym,\n\n393\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.660\nEMET was the Enhanced\nMitigation Experienced Toolkit.\n\n394\n00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.630\nAnd the idea was it was a really cool\nidea, it would try to protect us from\n\n395\n00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.550\nsoftware vulnerabilities due\nto some mitigation there.\n\n396\n00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.720\nAnd it actually didn't matter that it,\nif it was a Microsoft program or\n\n397\n00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.640\nwritten by anybody else.\n\n398\n00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.820\nThe mitigation toolkit could look at that\nsoftware, understand that software, and\n\n399\n00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.095\nthen help defend against, if that software\nwas vulnerable to buffer overflows.\n\n400\n00:20:03.095 --> 00:20:05.531\nIt could try to help protect that\napplication from those buffer overflows.\n\n401\n00:20:05.531 --> 00:20:08.494\nIt uses ASR, and\na couple of the technologies,\n\n402\n00:20:08.494 --> 00:20:12.060\nto try to mitigate some of\nthose vulnerabilities there.\n\n403\n00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.485\nWeb proxies, another preventive type tool.\n\n404\n00:20:19.091 --> 00:20:23.110\nWith a web proxy, we should understand\nthat concept at this point.\n\n405\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.790\nBut remember,\na web proxy is just a middleman.\n\n406\n00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.280\nAnytime you say the word proxy,\n\n407\n00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.220\nyou think of middleman, and\na web proxy is no different.\n\n408\n00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.700\nI'm making a request to the web for\na web page or some resource,\n\n409\n00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.790\nthat proxy is gonna intercept that request\nand then make the request on my behalf.\n\n410\n00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.270\nAnd so, we run these for several reasons.\n\n411\n00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.070\nTo protect the inside of our network or\n\n412\n00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.360\nkinda hide it a little bit\nfrom the outside world.\n\n413\n00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.990\nBecause as that request goes through the\nproxy, the proxy then, let's say Daniel's\n\n414\n00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:56.950\nmy proxy and I say, hey, I want to go to\nMicrosoft.com, and I send my little Git.\n\n415\n00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.260\nIt gets to Daniel, and\n\n416\n00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.440\nDaniel says, I see you want to go\nto Microsoft, hold on a second.\n\n417\n00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.390\nAnd then Daniel says,\nhey Microsoft, I want your webpage.\n\n418\n00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.970\nMicrosoft knows nothing about me,\nsends the request back to Daniel, right?\n\n419\n00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:13.909\nHere's Microsoft.com, Daniel says, okay\ngreat thanks Why'd you send this to me?\n\n420\n00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:17.083\nYeah, Mike asked for it and then hands it\nback to me and then I get my web page.\n\n421\n00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:22.970\nAnd so, there's a little bit of security\nthrough obscurity going on there.\n\n422\n00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.300\nHiding internal IP addresses, but\n\n423\n00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:31.029\nmore than that it also speeds up\nnetwork browsing because it will cache.\n\n424\n00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:34.490\nYou can setup as a caching server and\n\n425\n00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.790\nit gives me a chance to inspect,\nto see what's going on.\n\n426\n00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:42.690\nBecause theoretically, all web traffic\nshould be funneled through that proxy.\n\n427\n00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.920\nAs long as your users\nhaven't found a back door or\n\n428\n00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.200\ncovert channel to get around it,\neverything's going through there.\n\n429\n00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.878\nAnd all the information coming\nback goes through there.\n\n430\n00:21:49.878 --> 00:21:55.062\nSo, there's a chance to inspect all the\npackets, to look for malicious information\n\n431\n00:21:55.062 --> 00:21:59.674\nin those packets, as well as control\nof websites you're going to, right?\n\n432\n00:21:59.674 --> 00:22:03.510\nYou see this all the time in schools,\ngovernments, and places like that.\n\n433\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.692\nThey're running proxies for the fore\nmentioned reasons, but also because I can\n\n434\n00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:09.512\nsay, you're not allowed to go to\nFacebook during work hours, right?\n\n435\n00:22:09.512 --> 00:22:12.131\nWhile you're on your work computer,\nFacebook is off limits, and\n\n436\n00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:13.830\nwe'll just block it at the proxy.\n\n437\n00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.990\nThe request never leaves.\n\n438\n00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:17.690\nYou might try to go to Facebook,\nit gets to the proxy, and\n\n439\n00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.689\nDaniel proxy over here says,\n[SOUND] right, and throws it out.\n\n440\n00:22:20.689 --> 00:22:21.900\nIt says no.\n\n441\n00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.580\nYou can't go to Facebook.\n\n442\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.375\nSo, that's a proxy server.\n\n443\n00:22:26.375 --> 00:22:28.310\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n444\n00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:32.090\nWe also have web application firewalls.\n\n445\n00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:36.550\nWeb application firewalls are a firewall,\nall right?\n\n446\n00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.910\nBut they're really designed\nspecifically for web applications.\n\n447\n00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:45.120\nWe don't run these at the network borders\nlike we do a Cisco or Paolo Alto firewall.\n\n448\n00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.950\nWe run these on our web servers.\n\n449\n00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:52.490\nAnd they're designed to\nprotect the web application.\n\n450\n00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:57.150\nAnd we can use them to control\nexactly what is allowed to go in and\n\n451\n00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.340\nout of that particular application.\n\n452\n00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.880\nAs well as monitor that information\nthat's being send in and\n\n453\n00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.850\nout of that web application and there are\nseveral out there that we could look at.\n\n454\n00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:15.170\nLet's see, they mention a couple here.\n\n455\n00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.280\nAnd again, by name I want to\nmake sure I mention these names,\n\n456\n00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.120\njust in case they ask you on the exam.\n\n457\n00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.742\nModSecurity.\n\n458\n00:23:22.742 --> 00:23:24.550\nLet's go.\nWe'll take a look at their webpage.\n\n459\n00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.880\nI've got most of this stuff bookmarked for\nus.\n\n460\n00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.860\nI say that and then I don't see\nmy bookmark for ModSecurity.\n\n461\n00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.151\nWhere did they go?\nLet's just find it here really quick.\n\n462\n00:23:39.453 --> 00:23:40.710\nThere we go.\n\n463\n00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.230\nThis is ModSecurity, and again,\nthis is a web application file.\n\n464\n00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:48.750\nWell they say, they are the Swiss Army\nknife of web application firewalls.\n\n465\n00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.536\nMuch like we said that Netcat was,\nlike I said,\n\n466\n00:23:51.536 --> 00:23:52.190\n&gt;&gt; EndMap.\n\n467\n00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.680\n&gt;&gt; End Map was the Swiss Army\nknife of scanners.\n\n468\n00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.970\n&gt;&gt; That might be true.\n\n469\n00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.112\nAnd then, NetCat says,\nthe TCP/IP Swiss Army knife.\n\n470\n00:23:59.112 --> 00:24:01.762\nSo, just make sure you categorize\ncorrectly on what Swiss Army\n\n471\n00:24:01.762 --> 00:24:02.412\nknife you are.\n\n472\n00:24:02.412 --> 00:24:03.719\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now,\n\n473\n00:24:03.719 --> 00:24:07.741\nwe've got a Swiss Army knife for\nweb access, [LAUGH] I can't even say that.\n\n474\n00:24:07.741 --> 00:24:10.946\nWeb application firewalls Is what\nI'm trying to say, or WAFS, so\n\n475\n00:24:10.946 --> 00:24:13.188\nthere are lots of Swiss Army\nknives out there.\n\n476\n00:24:13.188 --> 00:24:18.162\nBut again, if we take a look at their page\nand their selling points, what can it do?\n\n477\n00:24:18.162 --> 00:24:21.410\nReal-time application security\nmonitoring and access control.\n\n478\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:26.270\nWe can see the stream of traffic\ncoming in and out of that application.\n\n479\n00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:29.890\nFull logging,\ncontinuous passive security assessment.\n\n480\n00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.385\nWeb application hardening.\n\n481\n00:24:31.385 --> 00:24:33.330\nCuz it's a firewall for this application.\n\n482\n00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:36.010\nWe're gonna make sure we close off\nanything that doesn't need to be coming\n\n483\n00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.220\nthrough to that application.\n\n484\n00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.600\nAnd according to them this\none is very flexible.\n\n485\n00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:49.450\nSo this is just one example of\na web application firewall, right?\n\n486\n00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.020\nLet's see, they have some free rules.\n\n487\n00:24:54.020 --> 00:25:00.190\nIt is open source, I can't remember\nif this one is free or not.\n\n488\n00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.330\nSome of these are plugins as well.\n\n489\n00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:05.934\nThis looks like it's actually a firewall.\n\n490\n00:25:05.934 --> 00:25:11.610\nYeah, so I can go out there and we can\ninstall that using these various commands.\n\n491\n00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.280\nI even have a version for IAS.\n\n492\n00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.856\nOthers we might want to be familiar with,\n\n493\n00:25:18.856 --> 00:25:23.350\nNaxsi and Naxsi is a plugin for nginx.\n\n494\n00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:28.600\nIf you're running that on your web\nservers this would be a plug in that\n\n495\n00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.940\nI can add to give me that\nWAF capabilities for nginx.\n\n496\n00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.455\n&gt;&gt; Now well you can sell vehicles online.\n\n497\n00:25:35.455 --> 00:25:35.955\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n498\n00:25:35.955 --> 00:25:38.095\n&gt;&gt; This is what it looks like.\n\n499\n00:25:38.095 --> 00:25:40.455\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's your example of,\n\n500\n00:25:40.455 --> 00:25:43.195\nthere's your customized web\napp versus a classic web app.\n\n501\n00:25:43.195 --> 00:25:44.960\nAnd they're saying they protect them all.\n\n502\n00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:52.050\nAll right, so that again,\nthat is NBS Systems who has NAXSI.\n\n503\n00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:57.730\nAnother one might be Imperva and\nlet's go check out Imperva's page as well.\n\n504\n00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.340\nThere was something I found here.\n\n505\n00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.910\nLet's go back to NBS for a second.\n\n506\n00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.450\nYeah, let's take a look at.\n\n507\n00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:05.980\nI'm still on NBS.\n\n508\n00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.150\nHere's their page for NAXSI.\n\n509\n00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.930\nAnd I'll try to throw some of\nthese links in the show notes.\n\n510\n00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.630\nBut again, I wouldn't spend, like I have,\n\n511\n00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.470\nspend all morning bookmarking\nall these pages, because, again,\n\n512\n00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:20.520\nthey're not gonna get you on the exam\non how do you install Naxsi?\n\n513\n00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.500\nHow do you configure rules in Naxsi?\n\n514\n00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:28.126\nIt's more important to understand that if\nyou need a web application firewall and\n\n515\n00:26:28.126 --> 00:26:32.463\nthey say what would you use,\nN Map, Ethereal or Naxsi, okay?\n\n516\n00:26:32.463 --> 00:26:36.746\nUnderstand that NAXSI is the web\napplication firewall, Ethereal is not.\n\n517\n00:26:36.746 --> 00:26:38.720\nSo those are the kind of things\nthat we gotta be familiar with.\n\n518\n00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.570\nLet's see what else,\nwe talked about Imperva there.\n\n519\n00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:47.440\nSo Daniel, that is probably, I'm sorry,\nI was gonna go to Imperva's site.\n\n520\n00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.510\nLet's do that last one there.\n\n521\n00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.290\n&gt;&gt; Don't leave them out, bro.\n\n522\n00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, no, no,\nwe've gotta get those guys.\n\n523\n00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:52.730\nHere, there it is.\n\n524\n00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.210\nRight, their product is\nSecureSphere Web Application/Firewall.\n\n525\n00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:03.390\nAnd you can tell just from their site,\nthis is a very high-end one.\n\n526\n00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:09.409\nIt's got a lot of capabilities and when\nyou look at paid versus free also keep\n\n527\n00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:15.940\nin mind open source doesn't necessarily\nmean free, just keep that in mind.\n\n528\n00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.620\nBut when you're looking at free\nsolutions verses the paid solutions\n\n529\n00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.290\na lot of times the free ones,\nand not always, right?\n\n530\n00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.010\nThere are some very good free,\nI mean most of the free ones are good.\n\n531\n00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.660\nI'm trying to think of the best\npolitically correct way to make\n\n532\n00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.020\nsure I say this, right?\n\n533\n00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.690\nWhen it's free, a lot of times we don't\nget some of the bells and whistles,\n\n534\n00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:33.960\nthe pretty graphical user interface.\n\n535\n00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.660\nThat doesn't mean the products is any.\n\n536\n00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.150\n&gt;&gt; Less capable?\n\n537\n00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, less capable, thank you.\n\n538\n00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.260\nIn fact, well, I think we've talked\nabout this on another episode,\n\n539\n00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.100\nyou look at something\nlike OSSIM which is free.\n\n540\n00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.350\nYou look at, who is that?\n\n541\n00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.430\nThat's.\n\n542\n00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:52.180\n&gt;&gt; Alien Vault.\n\n543\n00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.260\n&gt;&gt; Alien Vault, thank you.\n\n544\n00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.850\nAlien Vault, which is not free,\nbut it's based on OSSIA,\n\n545\n00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.910\nit's the same engine, right?\n\n546\n00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.140\nSo why would I pay?\n\n547\n00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.940\nBecause with Alien Vault I get many,\nmany, many more capabilities.\n\n548\n00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.650\nA great front end, the ability to manage\nenterprise versus a single system.\n\n549\n00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.710\nThat's a lot of times a difference too,\nwhere I can install one sensor for\n\n550\n00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:14.190\nthe free product, but if I wanna go\nenterprise and protect multiple locations\n\n551\n00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.760\nor multiple devices, I might need to\nstep up and buy a license from them.\n\n552\n00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.240\nImperva, this is a paid\none that you can get,\n\n553\n00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.950\nbut they make their\nSecureSphere Wireless Access Firewall.\n\n554\n00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:27.660\nI like that,\n\n555\n00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.750\nit just looks cool from the images\nthat they show you there, all right?\n\n556\n00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:36.790\nBut that's probably, that gets us through\nall of the preventative type tools\n\n557\n00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.050\nthey've listed out for\nthis particular module.\n\n558\n00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.580\nThat's probably a good place for\nus to take a break.\n\n559\n00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:46.220\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, well I will definitely have\nto dive into a part two because I know you\n\n560\n00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.200\nhave a few more categories of security\ntools that we might need to be aware of.\n\n561\n00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.250\nSo we'll have to dive into\nthose in subsequent episodes.\n\n562\n00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.150\nThat being said, thanks Mike,\nfor getting us thus far.\n\n563\n00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.520\nWe do thank you good folks out there for\nwatching.\n\n564\n00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.110\nBut, it is time for us to sign off.\n\n565\n00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.980\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n566\n00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:02.644\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n567\n00:29:02.644 --> 00:29:03.700\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n568\n00:29:08.255 --> 00:29:11.395\n[MUSIC]\n\n569\n00:29:11.395 --> 00:29:14.682\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:12.225\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:14.004\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:17.330\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.700\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\n\n7\n00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.570\nand in today's episode we're back\nwith more of our CSA+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.630\nAnd, of course, joining us for\na Part 2 on cybersecurity tools,\n\n9\n00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.660\nthe different types that we might run\ninto as a cybersecurity specialist,\n\n10\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.910\nour good friend, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.290\nMike, welcome back, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.970\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.260\n&gt;&gt; It's going fantastic as always.\n\n14\n00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.300\nExcited to be here and\nthanks for having me back.\n\n15\n00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes, of course.\n\n16\n00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncontinuing on with our tools, right?\n\n17\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.120\nWe talked about preventative\ntype tools in that last episode.\n\n18\n00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.970\nNow we're going to switch gears,\njump categories and\n\n19\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.620\nwe want to talk about\ncollective type tools.\n\n20\n00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.620\nAgain, just need to be familiar with\nthese tools, at least their names.\n\n21\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.590\nUnderstand it if your asked what\n\n22\n00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.470\ntool might you use to collect information\nabout events on your network.\n\n23\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.640\nAnd we would know what\ntool to pick from a list.\n\n24\n00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.830\nSo let's talk about these guys.\n\n25\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.465\nThe first thing we'll talk about\nwhen it comes to collective tools,\n\n26\n00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:14.220\nI think the name pretty much tells you\nwhat they're gonna be doing, right?\n\n27\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.328\nThey're collecting data of some kind,\n\n28\n00:01:16.328 --> 00:01:18.691\ndepending on what the tool\nis designed to do.\n\n29\n00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:21.062\nIt might be collecting up log events.\n\n30\n00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:23.740\nThey might be collecting\nnetwork statistics.\n\n31\n00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.570\nThey might be collecting packets\nstatistics or some other type of data.\n\n32\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.730\nSo that's what we mean by collective.\n\n33\n00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.000\nAnd the first topic in the collective\nsection is the SIEM system,\n\n34\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.010\nwhere we're talking about centralizing\n\n35\n00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.840\nreally large amounts of data\nis what it comes down to.\n\n36\n00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.290\nTrying to think of\na better way to say that.\n\n37\n00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.930\nWhen we talk about SIEM,\nreally SIEM stands for\n\n38\n00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.890\nmy security information and\nevent management.\n\n39\n00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.500\nSo it's more than, usually it's more\nthan just log files, but it is a way\n\n40\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.500\nto bring all this stuff together, rather\nthan look at log files in one place.\n\n41\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.820\nAnd look at network performance\ninformation in another place.\n\n42\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.520\nStart bringing all this together under one\n\n43\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.230\ninterface where we can make sense out of\nit because we've talked about this before.\n\n44\n00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.090\nWe said that we're living\nin the age of big data.\n\n45\n00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.530\nAnd that's not so much what you know,\nit's what can you do with what you know.\n\n46\n00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.560\nAnd information on its own\nis really hard to interpret.\n\n47\n00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.561\nWe need context to go\nwith that information.\n\n48\n00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:33.615\nAnd when we start pulling information\nfrom multiple sources and\n\n49\n00:02:33.615 --> 00:02:37.290\nwe start putting it together, we start\nseeing the bigger picture rather than\n\n50\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.170\njust looking at that one piece of data.\n\n51\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.690\nAnd that's SIEMs really\nhelp us do as well as just\n\n52\n00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.840\ngo through the massive\namounts of data that we have.\n\n53\n00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.510\nIt's not like I have that one web\nserver sitting out there that's\n\n54\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.320\nhosting an application.\n\n55\n00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.600\nWe have lots of servers that\nare providing resources.\n\n56\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.220\nWe have farms of servers and\nwe've got to monitor all of those logs.\n\n57\n00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.300\nAnd we've got to monitor all the activity\non our network, different branches,\n\n58\n00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.790\ndifferent locations.\n\n59\n00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.210\nSo pulling all that together\nwith our SIEM systems.\n\n60\n00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.110\nNow some of them we\nshould be familiar with.\n\n61\n00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.190\nArcSight is one, and let's take a peek\nat my screen here at least to give\n\n62\n00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.390\nyou something to look at other than\nmy face as we talk about this stuff.\n\n63\n00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.471\nArcSight is a Hewlett Packard solution.\n\n64\n00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:22.856\nIt is their SIEM appliance.\n\n65\n00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:27.364\nAnd when we say appliance, we're usually\ntalking about a stand-alone device\n\n66\n00:03:27.364 --> 00:03:29.864\nalthough a lot of these\ncan be virtualized.\n\n67\n00:03:29.864 --> 00:03:32.716\nIt could be a virtual appliance,\ncould be a physical appliance.\n\n68\n00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:37.507\nIn this case if we scroll down, we'll\nsee there is your ArcSight all-in-one\n\n69\n00:03:37.507 --> 00:03:40.710\nSIEM application or\nArcSight Express I should say.\n\n70\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.130\nAnd they have others available as well.\n\n71\n00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.170\nThat's just one.\n\n72\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.670\nBut you can see from this screenshot,\nsort of, kind of.\n\n73\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.160\nIf I zoom in here, top ten alerts by\ntarget objects, looking at the host, and\n\n74\n00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.970\nnetwork, and host application.\n\n75\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.260\nTop ten alert attacks, or\nattackers, top ten alert targets.\n\n76\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.180\nAnd this is not general web information,\nthis is information about your network,\n\n77\n00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.220\nand it's giving you a way to look\nat it that's a lot easier than\n\n78\n00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.690\nthumbing through log files, right?\n\n79\n00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.060\nIt's doing that work for you.\n\n80\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.780\nIt's taking all that log information,\nall that network analysis and\n\n81\n00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.980\npacket capture information.\n\n82\n00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.210\nAnd it's processing it, putting it\ntogether, making sense out of it and\n\n83\n00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.900\ngiving you this pretty pie\nchart that you can look at and\n\n84\n00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.560\nmake decisions based on that.\n\n85\n00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.096\nSo that's really what these\nsystems are all about.\n\n86\n00:04:28.096 --> 00:04:31.760\nAgain that's ArcSight\nfrom Hewlett Packard.\n\n87\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.196\nAnother one might be QRadar.\n\n88\n00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:36.458\nLet's take a peek at them.\n\n89\n00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:42.670\nThis is IBM's SIEM solution,\nIBM Security QRadar, all right.\n\n90\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.980\nSee they don't have a lot\nof pretty pictures, so\n\n91\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.457\nI'm just not gonna buy their products.\n\n92\n00:04:46.457 --> 00:04:49.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm kidding, IBM, I kid you.\n\n93\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.410\nAgain, just another SIEM solution.\n\n94\n00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.220\nWhat's another one they call out?\n\n95\n00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.750\nSplunk is probably one that most of you\nhave heard of, at least heard that name.\n\n96\n00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.410\nIt is one of the biggies,\nI guess you could say, in this field.\n\n97\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.100\nNamed a leader by the Forrester\nWave Security Analytics Platform.\n\n98\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.580\nBut it's real-time monitoring and\nsecurity.\n\n99\n00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.450\nAnd basically, they're telling you\nkinda what I've been telling you here.\n\n100\n00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.150\nYou see servers and devices,\napps, logs, traffic, and clouds,\n\n101\n00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.020\nwe see data, everywhere.\n\n102\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.070\nSplunk is what brings\nout that together and\n\n103\n00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.076\nallows me to use that\ninformation to make decisions.\n\n104\n00:05:28.076 --> 00:05:29.440\nI say make decisions,\n\n105\n00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.490\nwhat kind of decisions are we talking\nabout making based on this information?\n\n106\n00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.290\nWell, where do I need to spend my money?\n\n107\n00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.410\nWhich threats pose the most\nrisk to our network?\n\n108\n00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.108\nAre we seeing any of these\nvulnerabilities being worked on already?\n\n109\n00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:45.215\nAre there people trying to\ntake advantage of them?\n\n110\n00:05:45.215 --> 00:05:49.240\nBeing able to determine which ones I\nneed to protect or mitigate first.\n\n111\n00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.300\nThis are kind of things I can do or\n\n112\n00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.420\ndecisions I can make\nusing this information.\n\n113\n00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.160\nOr taking to the seed level people, right?\n\n114\n00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.030\nSaying look, we need to put more money,\nwe need to invest more money and\n\n115\n00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.160\nsecurity on our network to\nkeep these resources safe.\n\n116\n00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.950\nWell, yeah you say that,\nyou always say that.\n\n117\n00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.720\nYou just want to buy cool, new toys.\n\n118\n00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.740\nNo, look here's the data that's\nsupporting what I'm telling you.\n\n119\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.080\nWe have attack after\nattack being attempted.\n\n120\n00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.130\nWe need to beef up our defenses here,\nright?\n\n121\n00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.960\nSo those kind of things.\n\n122\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.785\nWhat else?\n\n123\n00:06:17.785 --> 00:06:19.910\nAlienVault is another one.\n\n124\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.490\nLet's go find their page.\n\n125\n00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.610\nI like AlienVault.\n\n126\n00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.070\nI like Splunk as well.\n\n127\n00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.090\nAlienVault, I'm actually working\non setting up a little demo.\n\n128\n00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.760\nCuz they do have a trial product as well.\n\n129\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.290\nBut you can see,\nlet's see what we can show you here.\n\n130\n00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.470\nAgain, same idea.\n\n131\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.920\nAsset discovery and inventory.\n\n132\n00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.690\nI mean, when we're talking about SIEMs,\nthey're really multi-purpose type tool,\n\n133\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.180\nsecurity information and event management.\n\n134\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.650\nSo, you're seeing not just\nlog files being collected.\n\n135\n00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.290\nAsset discovery and inventory,\nvulnerability assessment.\n\n136\n00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.140\nLet's not chat with you right now.\n\n137\n00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.260\nIntrusion detection,\nbehavioral monitoring.\n\n138\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.840\nSIEM and log management.\n\n139\n00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.200\n&gt;&gt; Kinda going back to that whole idea\nof everything getting bundled into\n\n140\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.960\none device anymore.\n\n141\n00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.950\nTrying to, why go to my competitor,\nI'll provide that for you.\n\n142\n00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.060\nI'll provided this and that.\n\n143\n00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.500\nYou buy one piece of hardware or appliance\nas it were, or one piece of software\n\n144\n00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.852\nthat you install on a box and\nit just does everything under the sun.\n\n145\n00:07:19.852 --> 00:07:23.240\nI mean, that's pretty impressive,\nand it is pretty attractive.\n\n146\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.790\n&gt;&gt; It really is,\nwhen you can look at working with an IPN.\n\n147\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.490\nLike I said, I've played around\nwith AlienVault's trial products.\n\n148\n00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.100\nAnd fantastic interface.\n\n149\n00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.250\nI mean, the amount of data that's pulling\nin, you think I'm gonna be wading through.\n\n150\n00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.980\nI'm gonna have to write filters\nto find what I look for.\n\n151\n00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.834\nThat's all laid out for you.\n\n152\n00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:45.411\nYou go to, you see like this,\nthis is a particular asset, and\n\n153\n00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:48.933\nI can see vulnerabilities, alarms, events,\n\n154\n00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:53.881\navailability, services,\nwhat that one says, groups, notes.\n\n155\n00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:57.697\nThere's even a map over here, where if you\nhave geolocation enabled, it can tell you\n\n156\n00:07:57.697 --> 00:08:01.305\nwhere the device is Especially important\nwith our mobile type devices, right?\n\n157\n00:08:01.305 --> 00:08:05.607\nI need to know where that person is, or a\ndevice has gotten misplaced, or stolen and\n\n158\n00:08:05.607 --> 00:08:07.770\nwe need to try to track it down.\n\n159\n00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.390\nI'm not exactly sure how.\n\n160\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.710\nI'm not saying we could use that\nto track down a stolen device.\n\n161\n00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.650\nBut the idea is there.\n\n162\n00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.580\nSo AlienVault, and this is one,\nI think we mentioned another episode, too.\n\n163\n00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.955\nThis is a product that you would pay for.\n\n164\n00:08:19.955 --> 00:08:22.200\nYou have to get a license for this.\n\n165\n00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.760\nBut it's based off of OSSIM,\nwhich is a free one.\n\n166\n00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.191\nSo let's take a look at that\nas well while we're here.\n\n167\n00:08:34.162 --> 00:08:37.670\nAll right, and you'll see I'm\nstill on AlienVault's page, right?\n\n168\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:44.752\nAlienVault OSSIM, the world's most widely\nused open source SIEM system, right?\n\n169\n00:08:44.752 --> 00:08:46.950\nI can download the ISO right there.\n\n170\n00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:52.636\nAnd honestly it looks like it has,\nI don't know if that's actually\n\n171\n00:08:52.636 --> 00:08:57.624\na screenshot from OSSIM, but\nit is the underlying engine,\n\n172\n00:08:57.624 --> 00:09:02.238\nright, for\nAlienVault system that we just looked at.\n\n173\n00:09:02.238 --> 00:09:06.510\nTheir USM offers a lot more features,\na lot more capabilities.\n\n174\n00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.440\nBut maybe that's it's not\nwhat your enterprise needs.\n\n175\n00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.370\nSo if you're a small organization,\nyou're looking for something a little\n\n176\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.370\nless expensive, like free,\nthis might be what you want to look into.\n\n177\n00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.050\nAnd I think they had a comparison chart.\n\n178\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.200\nYeah, here we go.\n\n179\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.520\nJust to give you an idea.\n\n180\n00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.650\nSo when you're looking at OSSIM, it's\nopen source software, down lower pricing.\n\n181\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:30.780\nOpen source, versus their USM appliance,\nis 55, $100 with the perpetual license.\n\n182\n00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.200\nIt's virtual or\na hardware appliance in your data center.\n\n183\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.910\nWe get down to, and you can see that\nthe free one is a single server only.\n\n184\n00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.537\nWhereas if I go up to their paid version,\n\n185\n00:09:41.537 --> 00:09:46.422\nI can have nodes at different physical\nlocations running their software.\n\n186\n00:09:46.422 --> 00:09:50.398\nBut as far as capabilities go, they\nall do asset discovery, vulnerability,\n\n187\n00:09:50.398 --> 00:09:54.280\nintrusive detection, behavioral\nmonitoring, SIEM event correlation.\n\n188\n00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.198\nWhat it doesn't do is some of\nthe log management capabilities.\n\n189\n00:09:58.198 --> 00:09:59.463\nThen, as we go down here,\n\n190\n00:09:59.463 --> 00:10:02.797\nsome of those higher end features\ncontinuous thread intelligence,\n\n191\n00:10:02.797 --> 00:10:07.060\ndedicated phone support and email support,\nyou don't get that with the free version.\n\n192\n00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.610\nWhen you pay for it though,\nif you have a problem or\n\n193\n00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.060\nyou have a question about the product\nwhat it can do or configuring it,\n\n194\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.910\nyou can call them up and get technical\nsupport, that's what you're paying for.\n\n195\n00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:24.400\nSo that is AlienVault and OSSIM,\na couple of great SIEM systems there.\n\n196\n00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.589\nAnd the last SIEM I want to point out\nthat they call out in the objectives is\n\n197\n00:10:27.589 --> 00:10:28.230\nKiwi Syslog.\n\n198\n00:10:31.546 --> 00:10:33.130\nWe got that one here.\n\n199\n00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:37.236\nAnd this is, I like this,\na syslog server for Windows.\n\n200\n00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:39.051\nWe talked about syslog.\n\n201\n00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:44.990\nIt's a way to centralize logging your\nNix-based systems, right, support this.\n\n202\n00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.530\nYou're on a syslog server.\n\n203\n00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.120\nYou've got your nodes that\ngenerate their events.\n\n204\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.980\nThey've got a syslog client that's\ngonna feed that information back to\n\n205\n00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.860\nthe syslog server.\n\n206\n00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.320\nIt's a way to do a couple of things.\n\n207\n00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.170\nOne, we get those logs in one place.\n\n208\n00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.634\nAnd now if somebody wipes\nlogs on one of my servers,\n\n209\n00:11:00.634 --> 00:11:05.260\nI've still got a copy of that log\ninformation on my syslog server.\n\n210\n00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:09.730\nAlso allows me to do big\ndata analytics on it,\n\n211\n00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.590\nbecause I can now get all the logs from\nall the different systems and start\n\n212\n00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:19.470\nrunning queries on that, reports on that,\nand further analyze that information.\n\n213\n00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.070\nBut it is something that we\nlacked in the Windows side.\n\n214\n00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.760\nThere were some tools that would\nallow you to tie a Windows\n\n215\n00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.230\nclient, or I had a client that would\nreport back to a Nix-based syslog server.\n\n216\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.750\nNow we've got a syslog server, I say now,\nit's not like this is brand new, but\n\n217\n00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:42.590\nKiwi is a syslog server for Windows.\n\n218\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:47.154\nAnd honestly,\nthat price tag is not that bad, $295.\n\n219\n00:11:47.154 --> 00:11:50.157\nAll right, so those are SIEM systems.\n\n220\n00:11:50.157 --> 00:11:55.261\nNow other types of collection tools that\nwe need to be familiar with when it comes\n\n221\n00:11:55.261 --> 00:11:59.996\nto network scanning, they only put\none on their list, and that's Nmap.\n\n222\n00:11:59.996 --> 00:12:03.060\n&gt;&gt; Well that's the worst one, so\nI understand why they would do that.\n\n223\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.280\nNo, we're being facetious, it's funny.\n\n224\n00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.090\nBecause Nmap is probably the gold\nstandard of network scanning, right?\n\n225\n00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:15.379\nIf you wanna find host discovery,\nyou wanna do port enumeration,\n\n226\n00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:20.386\nservice enumeration,\neven some vulnerabilities scanning up\n\n227\n00:12:20.386 --> 00:12:25.687\nto actual vulnerability attacks,\nright, trying to get into it.\n\n228\n00:12:25.687 --> 00:12:30.051\nNmap is a great way to go and again\none of our favorite prices available,\n\n229\n00:12:30.051 --> 00:12:32.106\nwhich is that good old free 99.\n\n230\n00:12:32.106 --> 00:12:34.160\nIt's just download it and use it.\n\n231\n00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.640\nPlenty of documentation involved.\n\n232\n00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.942\nMike, this thing, if you're not using\nNmap as a security professional,\n\n233\n00:12:39.942 --> 00:12:42.003\nyou're missing the boat, right?\n\n234\n00:12:42.003 --> 00:12:44.690\n&gt;&gt; You are, I mean,\nI can't see how you've made it this far.\n\n235\n00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:50.418\nI know there are other tools that\nare capable, but Nmap is the standard,\n\n236\n00:12:50.418 --> 00:12:54.270\nthe quote unquote, standard when\nit comes to network scanners.\n\n237\n00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:59.020\nAnd as you said, the free price\ntag makes it very, very appealing.\n\n238\n00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.222\nAnd it's relatively intuitive\nto work with, all right?\n\n239\n00:13:03.222 --> 00:13:06.020\nOnce you play with a little bit,\nit's fantastic.\n\n240\n00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.522\nIt does great scanning packet capture.\n\n241\n00:13:08.522 --> 00:13:13.209\nBut it also does the Azure, and we talked,\nand in fact we did a demo I think on it\n\n242\n00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:17.849\nin one of our previous episodes where we\ngot to see it has a scripting engine.\n\n243\n00:13:17.849 --> 00:13:22.270\nHas its own Nmap scripting engine\nthat you can write scripts.\n\n244\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.986\nThere are 500 and some odd scripts\nthat come with Nmap already to do\n\n245\n00:13:25.986 --> 00:13:30.873\neverything from port scans, to operating\nsystem detection, to vulnerability checks.\n\n246\n00:13:30.873 --> 00:13:34.420\nAnd as Daniel said, even some\nattempts at compromising the system.\n\n247\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.750\nSo, it's an incredibly powerful tool.\n\n248\n00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.098\nI got their website pulled up just\nin case you haven't been there.\n\n249\n00:13:39.098 --> 00:13:44.810\nNmap.org is where you're gonna\nwanna go to get lots of great info.\n\n250\n00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:49.860\nNot only get the installation where\nyou can download that, but great,\n\n251\n00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.830\ngreat tutorials and things like that that\nyou can get off of their site as well.\n\n252\n00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.435\nAnd it's something that I think\nevery security professional,\n\n253\n00:13:59.435 --> 00:14:03.480\nif you're getting into this field,\ngo ahead and start working with Nmap.\n\n254\n00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.190\nBecause it doesn't take\nmuch to install it.\n\n255\n00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.490\nIt's free, and\nyou just need to get familiar with it.\n\n256\n00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.030\nAll right, so that is good old Nmap.\n\n257\n00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.540\nNow when it comes to\nvulnerability scanners, right,\n\n258\n00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.250\nthere are all types of\nvulnerability scanners.\n\n259\n00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.200\nThey are coming out of\nthe woodwork nowadays.\n\n260\n00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.891\nAnd they all claim to be the best.\n\n261\n00:14:20.891 --> 00:14:22.801\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n&gt;&gt; That was one of the things as I\n\n262\n00:14:22.801 --> 00:14:26.711\nwas preparing for this show,\nI was bookmarking a lot of these pages and\n\n263\n00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:30.554\nI was making a mental note to myself\nthat the majority of the methods,\n\n264\n00:14:30.554 --> 00:14:35.480\n[LAUGH] in their banner somewhere say, the\nworld's leader in or the world's favorite.\n\n265\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.530\nIt's like saying you have\nthe world's best pizza.\n\n266\n00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.700\nIt's like, there's a pizza shop here and\nit says the best pizza in town.\n\n267\n00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.540\nAnd there's one on the other corner\nthat says we're the best pizza in town.\n\n268\n00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:48.482\nWait.\n\n269\n00:14:48.482 --> 00:14:49.737\n&gt;&gt; They're all subjective, yeah.\n\n270\n00:14:49.737 --> 00:14:52.604\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyway, ITs.\n\n271\n00:14:52.604 --> 00:14:55.980\nBut there are, again there are several\nvulnerability scanners out there.\n\n272\n00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.200\nLet me go back.\n\n273\n00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.040\nI don't think I talked about yet\nreal quick network scanning.\n\n274\n00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.410\nWe do wanna make sure we\nunderstand that category.\n\n275\n00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.194\nI think we've already\ntalked about it enough but\n\n276\n00:15:05.194 --> 00:15:07.076\njust to make sure I cover\nit in this episode as well.\n\n277\n00:15:07.076 --> 00:15:11.025\nWhen we're talking about network scanning,\nwe're talking about scanning the network\n\n278\n00:15:11.025 --> 00:15:14.410\ncuz we're looking at the activity\nthat's going across the network.\n\n279\n00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.061\nThat gives me a chance\nto do protocol analysis,\n\n280\n00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:19.791\nsee what protocols are being\nused on my network.\n\n281\n00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:23.970\nI can do packet analysis, see what kind\nof data is being sent across my network.\n\n282\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.064\nYou look at what connections\nare being established out there.\n\n283\n00:15:26.064 --> 00:15:27.880\nI can follow streams.\n\n284\n00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.673\nLots of good stuff there\nwith network scanning.\n\n285\n00:15:29.673 --> 00:15:34.000\nVulnerability scanning, well,\nwe're scanning for vulnerabilities, right?\n\n286\n00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.560\nThe name is again pretty explanatory.\n\n287\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.300\nBut there's different classes\nof vulnerability scanners.\n\n288\n00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.641\nSome of them are a little more\nmultipurpose than others.\n\n289\n00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:48.190\nBut all vulnerability scanners\ndo basically the same thing.\n\n290\n00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.483\nThey have a database of\nknown vulnerabilities.\n\n291\n00:15:51.483 --> 00:15:54.021\nAnd they're going to scan a system and\n\n292\n00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:58.858\ncompare that with the database to\ndetermine if that system is vulnerable\n\n293\n00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:03.393\nTo that particular vulnerability,\nor it has that vulnerability.\n\n294\n00:16:03.393 --> 00:16:05.950\nAnd then it should give you\nsome kind of report back.\n\n295\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.960\nAnd most of them have a rating scale,\nsome kind of ranking,\n\n296\n00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.200\nlike hey, your server is vulnerable\nto this, and this is a huge risk.\n\n297\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.133\nWe're gonna red flag thator we're\ngonna call it a ten on our scale or\n\n298\n00:16:17.133 --> 00:16:20.600\nwhatever the case, or\nsevere how they choose to rate them.\n\n299\n00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.404\nAnother vulnerability comes back and says\nyep, you've got this one, but it's green,\n\n300\n00:16:25.404 --> 00:16:28.050\nor it's mild, or it's a medium threat.\n\n301\n00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:32.760\nSo most of them will do that and that's\njust to help you prioritize your work.\n\n302\n00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.569\nWhere do I need to spend my money and\nmy effort as I go and\n\n303\n00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:37.016\nmitigate all these risks.\n\n304\n00:16:37.016 --> 00:16:41.721\nSo vulnerability scanners we\ncan have scanners that look at\n\n305\n00:16:41.721 --> 00:16:45.215\nindividual systems, servers, clients.\n\n306\n00:16:45.215 --> 00:16:49.500\nWe can also find vulnerability scanners\nthat focus on a particular type of server,\n\n307\n00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.040\nlike web servers primarily.\n\n308\n00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:56.309\nThere are several web vulnerability\nservers, web application vulnerabilities,\n\n309\n00:16:56.309 --> 00:17:01.739\nas well, or vulnerability scanner, so lots\nof different scanners that we could use.\n\n310\n00:17:01.739 --> 00:17:04.985\nLet's talk about the ones\nthat they mentioned here.\n\n311\n00:17:04.985 --> 00:17:09.454\nIn the exam objectives the first\none would be Qualsys or\n\n312\n00:17:09.454 --> 00:17:12.180\nQualys, I guess I should say.\n\n313\n00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.626\nQualys I don't know why I always wanna\nsay I put an extra s in there, but\n\n314\n00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:16.514\nthat's Qualys.\n\n315\n00:17:16.514 --> 00:17:20.766\nAnd they are the Market Leader\nin Vulnerability Management,\n\n316\n00:17:20.766 --> 00:17:26.749\ncontinuously detect and protect against\nattacks whenever and wherever they appear.\n\n317\n00:17:26.749 --> 00:17:28.221\nAnd it's interesting too,\n\n318\n00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:31.416\nwe're starting to see some\noverlap between tools like this.\n\n319\n00:17:31.416 --> 00:17:34.289\nKinda crossing the line with\nsome of the Seam systems,\n\n320\n00:17:34.289 --> 00:17:37.360\nwhere we're talking about kind\nof an all in one solution.\n\n321\n00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.593\nThis is a paid solution here,\nagain by Qualys and\n\n322\n00:17:43.593 --> 00:17:48.272\nlet's see if they got any nice info for\nus down here.\n\n323\n00:17:48.272 --> 00:17:52.200\nThere's a nice screenshot\nof their product.\n\n324\n00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.580\nBut again, and you can kinda see,\nif I can zoom into this one a little bit.\n\n325\n00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.830\nIt's showing me different levels,\nlevel five, level four, level,\n\n326\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.370\nthree, level two and level one.\n\n327\n00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.100\nSo it's ranking\nthe vulnerabilities saying hey,\n\n328\n00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.410\nyou've got a lot of level three,\nnot so much of the level five.\n\n329\n00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.100\nBut those are probably the ones\nI wanna look at first,\n\n330\n00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.300\nthe ones that are the most dangerous.\n\n331\n00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.163\nSo lots of good information that gets\npushed back by these vulnerability\n\n332\n00:18:17.163 --> 00:18:18.685\nmanagement systems.\n\n333\n00:18:18.685 --> 00:18:19.835\nLet's see what else.\n\n334\n00:18:19.835 --> 00:18:21.321\nThat's probably good for Qualsys.\n\n335\n00:18:21.321 --> 00:18:25.950\nQualsy, sorry Qualys,\nI apologize I'm saying that wrong,\n\n336\n00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.540\nit is not Qualsys but it is Qualys.\n\n337\n00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:32.710\nAnd then another one might be Nessus.\n\n338\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.710\nI know anybody that's been in security for\na little while has heard of Nessus.\n\n339\n00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.736\nSo let's go take a peek\nat them real quick.\n\n340\n00:18:42.712 --> 00:18:49.060\nAnd Nessus is another\nvulnerability management system.\n\n341\n00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.030\nIn fact, I'm gonna do a demo.\n\n342\n00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.147\nLet's go peek at that real quick here.\n\n343\n00:18:54.147 --> 00:18:58.714\nDoesn't look like this is gonna\nhappen today, but I'm sorry,\n\n344\n00:18:58.714 --> 00:19:02.515\nactually that's something else,\nwe'll wait on that.\n\n345\n00:19:02.515 --> 00:19:09.720\nBut you can get a free trial of Nessus,\nI'm trying to think.\n\n346\n00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:16.730\nIt's a,\nIt's a very popular vulnerability scanner.\n\n347\n00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.090\nI'm trying to think of\nsomething else exciting to say.\n\n348\n00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:23.750\nAbout vulnerability scanners and-\n&gt;&gt; They all kinda do the same thing.\n\n349\n00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.050\nThey scan your network, looking for hosts.\n\n350\n00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.620\nFind hosts, and\nthen start throwing predefined\n\n351\n00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:34.530\nvulnerability type of attacks at them\nto see if they're vulnerable to them.\n\n352\n00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:39.340\nLooking for those telltale signs of you\nmight have a problem with X, Y or Z.\n\n353\n00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.132\nGiving you an exhaustive\nlist of these things.\n\n354\n00:19:41.132 --> 00:19:45.110\nShowing you here are the most\nhighly recommended\n\n355\n00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.820\nholes that you have that\nyou might wanna try to fix.\n\n356\n00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.050\nHere's some medium, here's some low that\nyou might wanna even some informational.\n\n357\n00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.540\nNessus has been around a long time.\n\n358\n00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.410\nNessus is a very good scanner.\n\n359\n00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:00.670\nI love Nessus, I remember cutting\nmy teeth on Nessus back on the.\n\n360\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.320\nLet's see here, it would have been\nthe early 200s, back when it was free.\n\n361\n00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:04.989\nWell, free free.\n\n362\n00:20:04.989 --> 00:20:06.470\nIt's still free,\nyou can still play with it.\n\n363\n00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.520\n&gt;&gt; They have Community Edition, yeah.\n\n364\n00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.390\n&gt;&gt; They've got a Community Edition but\nit used to be truly free,\n\n365\n00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.130\nyou could play with it,\nit was really great.\n\n366\n00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.290\nBut still a fantastic tool.\n\n367\n00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.320\nAll these things kinda do the same thing,\nthey just do them in different ways.\n\n368\n00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.150\nThe graphics look different,\nthe way they interact looks different, but\n\n369\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.879\nthe engine's probably aren't too\ndissimilar, to be honest with you.\n\n370\n00:20:24.879 --> 00:20:25.672\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n371\n00:20:25.672 --> 00:20:29.817\nAnother one that we should be familiar\nwith, again, that was tenable.\n\n372\n00:20:29.817 --> 00:20:33.760\nMakes nexus among many of the things but\nthis is their product.\n\n373\n00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.281\nOpenVAS is another one.\n\n374\n00:20:35.281 --> 00:20:37.123\nLet's go take a peek at their site.\n\n375\n00:20:37.123 --> 00:20:38.985\nWhere are we at here?\n\n376\n00:20:38.985 --> 00:20:43.300\nOpenVAS and this is open source,\nfreely available.\n\n377\n00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.540\nSo you can download OpenVAS, I'm gonna try\nto do a little demonstration on this one.\n\n378\n00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:52.680\nI've got that installed on my box, we'll\ntake a look at that in a future episode.\n\n379\n00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.808\n&gt;&gt; And hey, it might not be the leader,\nbut it is the most advanced.\n\n380\n00:20:55.808 --> 00:20:56.687\nAccording to them.\n[LAUGH]\n\n381\n00:20:56.687 --> 00:20:57.343\n&gt;&gt; It is the most advanced, right?\n\n382\n00:20:57.343 --> 00:20:59.579\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n383\n00:20:59.579 --> 00:21:02.286\n&gt;&gt; Marketing, it's a fun game to play.\n\n384\n00:21:02.286 --> 00:21:07.259\nBut yeah, another great one, I don't have\nanything bad to say about any of these.\n\n385\n00:21:07.259 --> 00:21:10.560\nBut this is what I'll try to demo for\nyou mainly cuz it's free and\n\n386\n00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.617\nit's pretty easy to set up\na little trial for that I love it,\n\n387\n00:21:13.617 --> 00:21:17.310\nit's got the what is it, the green\nbones security if I remember right.\n\n388\n00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.130\nIt's a web interface that once\nyou get open, all set up,\n\n389\n00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.790\nyou've got web interface and you use.\n\n390\n00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:26.210\nBut again, it's a vulnerability scanner so\nyou're gonna punch in a target,\n\n391\n00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.730\nit's gonna go scan it,\ncompare it against the database,\n\n392\n00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:32.760\nfeed you back a report,\ngive you your results.\n\n393\n00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.608\nWhat else?\nExpose is another one.\n\n394\n00:21:35.608 --> 00:21:38.578\nLet's take a look at that one.\n\n395\n00:21:38.578 --> 00:21:40.951\nI've got a million bookmarks here.\n\n396\n00:21:40.951 --> 00:21:43.203\nI'm trying to keep them all straight.\n\n397\n00:21:43.203 --> 00:21:46.582\nRapid7, great company out there,\nmake a lot of great products.\n\n398\n00:21:46.582 --> 00:21:50.830\nNexpose is their vulnerability scanner.\n\n399\n00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.040\nTry to do a little demo with this one.\n\n400\n00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.046\nOne of the things I love about this is\nit ties in very well with another point,\n\n401\n00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:02.738\nwhich we are going to look at in the\nfuture as well which is an attack frame\n\n402\n00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:06.127\nwork, yeah we are calling\nit an attack frame work.\n\n403\n00:22:06.127 --> 00:22:13.259\nYeah, again another vulnerability scanner\nyou can get a free trial of Nexpose.\n\n404\n00:22:13.259 --> 00:22:18.723\nI wanna say they have\na community version as well.\n\n405\n00:22:18.723 --> 00:22:21.534\nJust take a quick peek here and see.\n\n406\n00:22:21.534 --> 00:22:25.110\nYeah they've got their community edition.\n\n407\n00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:30.007\nSo with them, with Nexpose,\nthey'll give you a community edition,\n\n408\n00:22:30.007 --> 00:22:32.008\nit's a little bit limited.\n\n409\n00:22:32.008 --> 00:22:36.011\nYou can scan 32 IP networks,\nOSes, and databases, and\n\n410\n00:22:36.011 --> 00:22:40.340\nit's deployed via software\nthat you download from them.\n\n411\n00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.570\nWhen you download their trial, or when\nyou download the community edition, what\n\n412\n00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:49.228\nthey'll do is they'll give you, you'll\nhave to register with the community and\n\n413\n00:22:49.228 --> 00:22:53.603\nthey will give you a key that you punch in\nthat will license your community addition.\n\n414\n00:22:53.603 --> 00:22:58.699\nTheir enterprise addition though\nyou can see is unlimited IPs you\n\n415\n00:22:58.699 --> 00:23:03.619\ncan go across the boundaries so\nyou can tie to a single network.\n\n416\n00:23:03.619 --> 00:23:09.094\nTie to their some other products,\ncontrol in site and high priority\n\n417\n00:23:09.094 --> 00:23:15.330\nphone support and things like that\nthat you get from their paid version.\n\n418\n00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.960\nBut another fantastic\nvulnerability scanner and\n\n419\n00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:24.578\nthen the next one on the list I want to\ntalk about is NIKTO and NIKTO is one that,\n\n420\n00:23:24.578 --> 00:23:29.603\nit's actually on NIKTO two currently or\nnicto, I always say nicto.\n\n421\n00:23:29.603 --> 00:23:31.050\n&gt;&gt; I always said nicto.\n\n422\n00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.830\n&gt;&gt; Do you?\n&gt;&gt; Actually, I say nicto a lot because for\n\n423\n00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.310\nwhatever reason my brain\njumbles those words up.\n\n424\n00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.790\nI guess it's my limited dyslexia or\nsomething.\n\n425\n00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.720\n&gt;&gt; And so now I'm wondering\nif I've been saying it right?\n\n426\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:46.200\nIs it nicto to, or is it nicto to, or\n&gt;&gt; Nicto to, that's what I would say.\n\n427\n00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.031\n&gt;&gt; But anyway,\nregardless of how we pronounce it ther,\n\n428\n00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:53.109\nthey have great artists working for them.\n\n429\n00:23:53.109 --> 00:23:55.992\nOpen source, and\nthis is a web server scanner, so\n\n430\n00:23:55.992 --> 00:23:59.303\nthis one is really a little\nmore specific in what it does.\n\n431\n00:23:59.303 --> 00:24:03.731\nIt is designed to scan Web servers\nlooking for vulnerabilities.\n\n432\n00:24:03.731 --> 00:24:08.950\nSo if you're performing a pen test and\nyou want to scan their web servers,\n\n433\n00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:13.300\nthis is a go-to tool for\na lot of security professionals.\n\n434\n00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:17.856\nIt also has that great price tag\nthat Daniel loves, that free99.\n\n435\n00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:19.020\n&gt;&gt; That is amazing.\n\n436\n00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n437\n00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.720\nAll right, so great one there.\n\n438\n00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.410\nAnd again, what's really cool about the\nfree ones is you guys can go out there,\n\n439\n00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.390\ndownload these,\ninstall them in a little VM and\n\n440\n00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.140\nkinda test them out,\nrun them through their paces.\n\n441\n00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.360\nWhat else?\nAnd then of course, we would be remiss if\n\n442\n00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.660\nwe didn't mention everybody's\nfavorite vulnerability scanner.\n\n443\n00:24:38.405 --> 00:24:39.614\nAnd BSA?\n\n444\n00:24:39.614 --> 00:24:42.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n445\n00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.263\n&gt;&gt; Daniel's chuckling over there, yeah no.\n\n446\n00:24:44.263 --> 00:24:47.622\nMicrosoft Baseline Security Analyzer\nis a good tool for what it did.\n\n447\n00:24:47.622 --> 00:24:53.109\nIt's been around for a long time,\nback since Windows 2000,\n\n448\n00:24:53.109 --> 00:24:59.610\nand it's a vulnerability scanner,\nit scans Microsoft machines.\n\n449\n00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.620\nSo in a Microsoft environment,\nthis is a great scanner to have.\n\n450\n00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.416\nIt's freely available from Microsoft.\n\n451\n00:25:05.416 --> 00:25:09.448\nIt is fading out,though,\nfrom what I was reading today.\n\n452\n00:25:09.448 --> 00:25:14.127\nYou can see, they're dropping support for\na lot of the 2000s and\n\n453\n00:25:14.127 --> 00:25:18.654\nI don't see any support being added for\nWindows 10 or 2016.\n\n454\n00:25:18.654 --> 00:25:23.008\nAgain, Microsoft is changing a lot\nof their security now with moving\n\n455\n00:25:23.008 --> 00:25:24.818\neverything out into Azure.\n\n456\n00:25:24.818 --> 00:25:26.080\nSo we're seeing a lot of changes there.\n\n457\n00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.762\nSo I can't tell you, I can't speak to the\nfuture of MBSA but it is one we should be\n\n458\n00:25:32.762 --> 00:25:36.954\nfamiliar with because it is one that\nwe've definitely used in the past,\n\n459\n00:25:36.954 --> 00:25:38.144\nwe still use today.\n\n460\n00:25:38.144 --> 00:25:42.490\nIf we are running against windows systems,\nit's freely available.\n\n461\n00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:47.800\nSo if you are in a Microsoft environment\nit's a really good one to have.\n\n462\n00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.300\nAnd those are our vulnerability scanners.\n\n463\n00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:55.430\nGotta few minutes left in this one, let's\ntalk about some of the packet capture.\n\n464\n00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.210\nAgain, still in the collective\ncategory of tools.\n\n465\n00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.740\nBut now we're looking at\nthe subcategory of packet capture, and\n\n466\n00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.380\nyou know which one we're gonna start with.\n\n467\n00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.600\nI know everybody out there in\nmy TV audience is going, yay,\n\n468\n00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.270\nhe's gonna say Wireshark.\n\n469\n00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.357\n&gt;&gt; TCP.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n470\n00:26:10.357 --> 00:26:11.497\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sorry.\n\n471\n00:26:11.497 --> 00:26:15.389\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, we're gonna say\n&gt;&gt; Wireshark.\n\n472\n00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:19.170\nWire Shark is another one those\nthat has been around forever.\n\n473\n00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:23.356\nMaybe, albeit by another name\nearlier in its lifetime, but\n\n474\n00:26:23.356 --> 00:26:28.114\nit is another one of those tools that\nshould be part of your tool kit and\n\n475\n00:26:28.114 --> 00:26:33.714\nyou should be extremely familiar with,\nnot one that you break out now and again.\n\n476\n00:26:33.714 --> 00:26:38.030\nThis is gonna be one that you\nfind yourself using all the time.\n\n477\n00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.320\nSo go out there, get it,\nstart playing with it.\n\n478\n00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.850\nI tell people, I tell them back when I\nwas teaching things like Network Plus and\n\n479\n00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:47.910\nthings like that, if you want to learn\nprotocols this is the tool to get.\n\n480\n00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.012\nBecause I think we mentioned\nin the show the other day,\n\n481\n00:26:51.012 --> 00:26:54.855\nwe were talking about how yeah you\ncan talk about the Dora process but\n\n482\n00:26:54.855 --> 00:26:57.640\ngrab Wireshark and\nyou can see the Dora process.\n\n483\n00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:02.870\nYou can take it from that abstract thought\nand put it into something tangible there.\n\n484\n00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.630\nYou can see the DNS queries going out and\n\n485\n00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.940\nthe responses coming back\nfrom those servers and\n\n486\n00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:14.230\nthe flags when they talk about the ACK\nflag is set, or the Synac flag is set.\n\n487\n00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.588\nYou can see the TCP three way handshake.\n\n488\n00:27:16.588 --> 00:27:20.496\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, what's fun is do an\nend map scan and watch it with Wireshark\n\n489\n00:27:20.496 --> 00:27:25.273\nand you'll see, I'm running a sin scan,\nand there it is, it's in the sin, there's\n\n490\n00:27:25.273 --> 00:27:30.100\nthe sin ack, it dropped and look at that,\nthere's the conversation happening.\n\n491\n00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.030\nYou just watch these things so\n\n492\n00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.400\nyou can understand better maybe\nyour other tools or protocols.\n\n493\n00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.661\nYou really get a good\nsense of how they work.\n\n494\n00:27:35.661 --> 00:27:36.886\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, this is one,\n\n495\n00:27:36.886 --> 00:27:40.619\neven if I wasn't teaching this particular\nsecurity class and wasn't on the list,\n\n496\n00:27:40.619 --> 00:27:43.580\nI'd be saying, go out and\nget this tool and play with it.\n\n497\n00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.760\n&gt;&gt; But as far as what it does,\nfor this exam,\n\n498\n00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.450\nwe're talking about collective,\nwe're talking about gathering information.\n\n499\n00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:53.370\nWireshark is a fantastic\npacket capture utility.\n\n500\n00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.810\nWe're going to run it on our system, and\n\n501\n00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.420\nwe're gonna capture the raw\ntraffic that's traveling by.\n\n502\n00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.890\nThat's gonna give me a chance\nto do that packet analysis.\n\n503\n00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.020\nWe're gonna be doing\nprotocol analysis with this.\n\n504\n00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.490\nWe can look at connections that\nare going on in our network.\n\n505\n00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.176\nSo a great tool there.\n\n506\n00:28:12.176 --> 00:28:17.290\nTCP dump is another one is a command\nline utility that we can use in our\n\n507\n00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:22.230\nLinux environment,\nenvironment very similar to I guess\n\n508\n00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:27.650\na concept of what Wireshark does,\nit's just yet command line driven.\n\n509\n00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:31.269\nIt gives you that raw\noutput that we can take,\n\n510\n00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:37.092\nwe dump into a database of some kind and\nthen we can do our analysis there.\n\n511\n00:28:37.092 --> 00:28:38.020\n&gt;&gt; And you open it with Wireshark.\n\n512\n00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:38.740\nWhich you can do [LAUGH].\n\n513\n00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.018\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right [LAUGH].\n\n514\n00:28:40.018 --> 00:28:43.089\n&gt;&gt; Once you finish, you've got that dump\nfile you just turn around and open it\n\n515\n00:28:43.089 --> 00:28:46.480\nwith Wireshark but then you've got to ask\nyourself, well then, what am I using?\n\n516\n00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.194\nWhy did I just fire off\nWireshark in the first place?\n\n517\n00:28:49.194 --> 00:28:50.830\n&gt;&gt; Well, and that's a valid question.\n\n518\n00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.940\nLike, why would I use anything other than\nWireshark if I can get away with it?\n\n519\n00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.085\nBecause sometimes you're on a headless\nsystem that is command line driven And\n\n520\n00:28:58.085 --> 00:28:59.715\nonly what option do you have?\n\n521\n00:28:59.715 --> 00:29:02.675\nWell you go with the command line\noption which would be TCB dump.\n\n522\n00:29:02.675 --> 00:29:04.125\nThe good news is I can dump that,\n\n523\n00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:08.785\ngrab that file, copy it off to external\nmedia, put that on a different machine\n\n524\n00:29:08.785 --> 00:29:12.295\nthat does have a graphical user\ninterface with Wireshark installed and\n\n525\n00:29:12.295 --> 00:29:14.225\nuse all the bells and\nwhistles that come along with Wireshark.\n\n526\n00:29:14.225 --> 00:29:17.285\nSo they work hand in hand and\nthey're not like competitors, A,\n\n527\n00:29:17.285 --> 00:29:21.040\nbecause they're both free,\nthey don't care who you're using.\n\n528\n00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.600\nBut working them together can definitely\nbe advantageous from time to time.\n\n529\n00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, or if you're\ndoing a pen test you need to slip in\n\n530\n00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:32.780\na packet capture onto that\nnetwork that you're attacking.\n\n531\n00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:36.250\nProbably not gonna wanna load up\nWireshark on their systems but\n\n532\n00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.170\nyou can definitely get tcpdump in there.\n\n533\n00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.870\nYou can generate that file,\nftp it back out.\n\n534\n00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.120\nAnd then as you said do your analysis\nthrough open up that file with Wireshark.\n\n535\n00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.970\nSo, what's another one?\n\n536\n00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:50.030\nNetwork general was one\nthat has a long history,\n\n537\n00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.180\nI don't want to say long but\nwhere did I put that guy?\n\n538\n00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:57.091\n&gt;&gt; It's going around for\nat least three months, right [LAUGH]\n\n539\n00:29:57.091 --> 00:29:58.446\n&gt;&gt; At least three months and\n\n540\n00:29:58.446 --> 00:30:01.940\nof all places I've bookmarked\nthe Wikipedia page for this one.\n\n541\n00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.548\nJust because I was like well, what?\n\n542\n00:30:05.548 --> 00:30:07.870\nAnyway, doing my research,\nlooking for Network General.\n\n543\n00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:12.645\nWell, Network General is evidently\nno more, it is now NetScout.\n\n544\n00:30:12.645 --> 00:30:14.795\nAnd I just found this amusing.\n\n545\n00:30:14.795 --> 00:30:15.715\nWhere was it?\n\n546\n00:30:15.715 --> 00:30:17.235\nTalking about it here.\n\n547\n00:30:17.235 --> 00:30:20.535\nYeah, so NetScout Systems founded\nin 1984 as Network General.\n\n548\n00:30:20.535 --> 00:30:24.185\nNetwork General developed the original\nnetwork packet sniffer in 86,\n\n549\n00:30:24.185 --> 00:30:26.860\nmerged with McAfee in 1997.\n\n550\n00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:31.267\nForm Network Associates also created\nthe first ethernet probe and then\n\n551\n00:30:31.267 --> 00:30:36.189\nNetwork Associates sold off the sniffer\ntechnology to Silverlake Partners and\n\n552\n00:30:36.189 --> 00:30:41.037\ntake a specific group to form Network\nGeneral which is what they were called way\n\n553\n00:30:41.037 --> 00:30:41.938\nback in 84.\n\n554\n00:30:41.938 --> 00:30:46.546\nBut then Network General acquired\nFidela Technology adding to the Net Vigil\n\n555\n00:30:46.546 --> 00:30:48.204\nbusiness system monitor.\n\n556\n00:30:48.204 --> 00:30:51.488\nNetwork generally be agree to be\nrequired by NetScout systems for\n\n557\n00:30:51.488 --> 00:30:52.940\n$205 million dollars.\n\n558\n00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:56.670\nAnyway, I don't point that out for any\nreal particular reason other than the fact\n\n559\n00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.720\nthat Network General, over the years\nhas changed its name several times,\n\n560\n00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:04.640\nhas been bought, acquired, sold, bought\nacquired, it is now NetScout Systems.\n\n561\n00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.270\nBut evidently on the Compte,\nthey're still calling it Network General.\n\n562\n00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.638\nSo I just wanted to make sure that\nIf you're doing your studying and\n\n563\n00:31:09.638 --> 00:31:12.454\nyou're doing your research and\nyou're like, what is this network general?\n\n564\n00:31:12.454 --> 00:31:16.440\nGo out and look out NetScout systems,\nand you can find some information.\n\n565\n00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.470\nBut it is a packet capture technology.\n\n566\n00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:24.086\nSo in the end, it is a sniffing technology\nthat's going to allow me to capture\n\n567\n00:31:24.086 --> 00:31:27.850\nthe raw packet data that's\ntravelling across the network, so\n\n568\n00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.974\nthat I can do packet analysis,\nprotocol analysis,\n\n569\n00:31:30.974 --> 00:31:34.476\nand look and\nsee what's going on on our system, right?.\n\n570\n00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:37.570\nLet's see what else, where did we\nget off on that packet capture.\n\n571\n00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:41.359\nThe last one I want to talk about for\n\n572\n00:31:41.359 --> 00:31:46.984\nthis one is another goodie and\nthat is Aircrack ng.\n\n573\n00:31:46.984 --> 00:31:51.905\nAnd Aircrack ng you can probably infer\nfrom the name this is gonna have something\n\n574\n00:31:51.905 --> 00:31:53.895\nto do with wireless and it does.\n\n575\n00:31:53.895 --> 00:31:59.082\nComplete suite of tools to assess\nthe wi-fi network security.\n\n576\n00:31:59.082 --> 00:32:02.154\nAnd it's in this section\nbecause it does monitoring.\n\n577\n00:32:02.154 --> 00:32:06.578\nPacket capture and export data\nof our wireless traffic, right?\n\n578\n00:32:06.578 --> 00:32:08.600\nBut it can also do a lot more.\n\n579\n00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:13.424\nYou can do attacking, you can do\npassword attacks, replay attacks,\n\n580\n00:32:13.424 --> 00:32:16.299\nfake access points, packet injection.\n\n581\n00:32:16.299 --> 00:32:21.929\nWe can test Wi-Fi systems, crack WPA, WEP.\n\n582\n00:32:21.929 --> 00:32:24.974\nSo it's a very, very powerful tool and\n\n583\n00:32:24.974 --> 00:32:29.600\nit actually has a Windows port as well,\nwhich is very cool.\n\n584\n00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.010\nBut again,\njust another packet capture utility.\n\n585\n00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.270\nThis one really is focused on Wi-Fi,\n\n586\n00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:38.530\nbut don't infer from that that\nthe other ones don't do Wi-Fi, right?\n\n587\n00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:39.490\nIt's all about whether or\n\n588\n00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:44.120\nnot the program has a driver that can talk\nto that network adapter that you're using.\n\n589\n00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.046\nI know, for example, Wire Socket,\nreally when it was Ether Reel,\n\n590\n00:32:49.046 --> 00:32:52.475\nat first I had trouble with\ncertain wireless adapters of mine,\n\n591\n00:32:52.475 --> 00:32:56.809\nyou had to make sure had the, it was\nlooking for a particular Orangeco chipset,\n\n592\n00:32:56.809 --> 00:32:58.897\nso you had to research-\n&gt;&gt; I remember that, yeah.\n\n593\n00:32:58.897 --> 00:33:00.820\n&gt;&gt; On what wireless network\nadapter you were buying.\n\n594\n00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:05.040\nIt's like, I couldn't just go out and buy\na Linksys or this I had to do research on\n\n595\n00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:10.810\nwhat chipset that manufacturer was using,\nto see if it was going to work with this.\n\n596\n00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:14.850\nBut now, Wireshark has picked up every\nnetwork I've had, every network adapter\n\n597\n00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:20.180\nI've had thrown at it in the last\nfew years, I haven't had any issues.\n\n598\n00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.370\nWhether it's wired or\nwireless network adapters.\n\n599\n00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.890\nSo I just wanted to bring that\nup because when you see this,\n\n600\n00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:29.120\nyou're like, I've gotta get a different\npack of CAPTCHA utility for wireless.\n\n601\n00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.770\nNot necessarily,\nit really depends on what you're using.\n\n602\n00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:35.471\nSome programs might not recognize\nthose wireless cards but\n\n603\n00:33:35.471 --> 00:33:37.469\nreally when it comes down to it,\n\n604\n00:33:37.469 --> 00:33:42.443\nonce it gets to your network adapter\nit's just like any other traffic, right?\n\n605\n00:33:42.443 --> 00:33:44.438\nI mean it's not like it's,\nwell, I shouldn't say.\n\n606\n00:33:44.438 --> 00:33:46.520\nBut it's not like it's flagged,\nhey, this is a wireless packet.\n\n607\n00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.440\nYou're not gonna understand that.\n\n608\n00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.340\nIt's not a different language per se,\nas far as the TCP/IP goes.\n\n609\n00:33:52.383 --> 00:33:57.285\nAnyhow, so\nAircrack-ng is a good one to play with if\n\n610\n00:33:57.285 --> 00:34:01.815\nyou want to do a little Wi-Fi sniffing,\nas well as go a little bit beyond there.\n\n611\n00:34:01.815 --> 00:34:04.885\nIt kinda gets in some of the other\ncategories because it will do some\n\n612\n00:34:04.885 --> 00:34:06.665\nattacking as well.\n\n613\n00:34:06.665 --> 00:34:10.535\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike,\nI know we have more to talk about.\n\n614\n00:34:10.535 --> 00:34:12.970\nWe have a laundry list to\ncontinue to go through.\n\n615\n00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:14.690\nBut, we are well out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n616\n00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:18.350\nSo, we'll have to roll this into\na part three, maybe even a part four.\n\n617\n00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:19.196\nYou never know, right?\n\n618\n00:34:19.196 --> 00:34:20.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You never know with us.\n\n619\n00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:22.100\nWe might get crazy and go for a part four.\n\n620\n00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.530\nBut that would mean we're definitely gonna\ndo a part three, so join us for that.\n\n621\n00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:26.790\nMike, thanks for joining us today.\n\n622\n00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:30.920\nAnd continuing down our list of\ndifferent cyber security tools\n\n623\n00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.880\nthat we need to be aware of for CSA+ exam.\n\n624\n00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.950\nThat being said, it is time for\nus to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n625\n00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:40.720\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n626\n00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.570\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n627\n00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.059\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n628\n00:34:44.059 --> 00:34:49.977\n[MUSIC]\n\n629\n00:34:49.977 --> 00:34:53.297\n&gt;&gt; Thank

00:00:10.109\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.869\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.461\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:18.570\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.252\nAnd we are back with more\non our series for CSA+.\n\n8\n00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:27.280\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio\ngoing into Part 3 of Cybersecurity Tools.\n\n9\n00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.060\nOur good friend and\nmentor, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.190\nMike, welcome back, man.\n\n11\n00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.820\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.280\n&gt;&gt; It's going great.\nThanks for having me back,\n\n13\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.810\nexcited as always.\n\n14\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.750\nAll right, so we left off, we were\ntalking about the collective category,\n\n15\n00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.970\ntools that collect information up for\nus we talked about seam systems,\n\n16\n00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.830\nwe talked about network scanners,\n\n17\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.700\nwe talked about vulnerability scanners,\nimpact and capture utilities.\n\n18\n00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.130\nNow, they want us to talk about\ncommand line and IP utilities.\n\n19\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.170\nSo again, these are things at this\npoint if you're studying this exam you\n\n20\n00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.980\nshould be familiar with.\n\n21\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.580\nSo we're basically refreshing our memory,\nright?\n\n22\n00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.910\nOn these guys.\n\n23\n00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.710\nFirst one I mentioned there is netstat.\n\n24\n00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.700\nNetstat is, I always think of it\nyour network statistics, right?\n\n25\n00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.910\nThis is what I use to look at the ports\nthat my machine is listening on,\n\n26\n00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.270\nsee what connections had been\nestablished to my machine.\n\n27\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.140\nOr what connections I've made outbound,\nagain, command line utility.\n\n28\n00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.460\nWe should,\nI won't do a full on demonstration, but\n\n29\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.355\nlet's at least just take a peak, I'll show\nyou one here just on my Windows machine.\n\n30\n00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:34.762\nNetStat, we'll do a switch question mark.\n\n31\n00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:40.660\nAnd I can see all the different switches\nthat come with, or that are available.\n\n32\n00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.200\nWith NetStat.\n\n33\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.640\nNetStat's not just a Microsoft thing,\nwe can do this on Linux systems as well.\n\n34\n00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.711\nI can do something like in NetStat-AN,\nfor example.\n\n35\n00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:53.970\nAnd you can see that,\nthat's probably really small.\n\n36\n00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.430\nThis is not set up for,\nthis is not what I normally use to do my\n\n37\n00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.350\ndemonstrations, so let me just bump\nthat up a wee bit there you go.\n\n38\n00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.590\nFor everybody.\n\n39\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.237\nSo, the command I ran in\nthis case was netstat -AN.\n\n40\n00:02:09.237 --> 00:02:13.270\nYou can see the N, display address and\nport numbers in numerical form.\n\n41\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.520\nThe A, all connections and\nlistening ports.\n\n42\n00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.950\nJust one that I use but there\nare obviously several switches there.\n\n43\n00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.410\nAnd so, I can see the different\nports that my system's listening on.\n\n44\n00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.140\nSome of them say LISTENING, so\nthis is a port that's open and\n\n45\n00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.110\nis waiting for a connection.\n\n46\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.560\nSome of them say ESTABLISHED, so now I\ncan see that my machine has a connection.\n\n47\n00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.400\nWith another machine.\n\n48\n00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.810\nI can see what port numbers are associated\nwith that connection, right?\n\n49\n00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.210\nSo this is where I would go to look,\nif I had suspected maybe some malware,\n\n50\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.440\nlike a trojan horse, some kind of\nbackdoor was listening on this system,\n\n51\n00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.770\nor was installed in the system.\n\n52\n00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.490\nI might be able to get\nsome information from here\n\n53\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.890\nIf I knew what port should\nbe there already, right?\n\n54\n00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.770\nI see these ports and\n\n55\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.940\nI'm like whoa, I don't know if\nthose should be there or not.\n\n56\n00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.660\nI don't have a good baseline,\nto compare it to.\n\n57\n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.870\nIt's not gonna do me as much good,\nbut it'll still be beneficial.\n\n58\n00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.130\nSo netstat for looking for\n\n59\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.590\nyour network statistics or\nwhat connections you have on that machine.\n\n60\n00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.370\nWhat ports are open?\n\n61\n00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.250\nWhat ports are listening?\n\n62\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.980\nWhat's another one they mention here,\n\n63\n00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.200\nping, hopefully we all\nare familiar with ping.\n\n64\n00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.520\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n65\n00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.580\n&gt;&gt; It's part of the game,\nping pong, it's the first half.\n\n66\n00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.260\nBut it's a network utility,\nit allows me to send ICMP or\n\n67\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.920\nInternet Control Message Protocol packets,\nwe use it typically to test.\n\n68\n00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.000\nConnectivity between a machine.\n\n69\n00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.390\nWe almost of our scanners\nused pings to test for\n\n70\n00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.100\nlive host before they do a thorough\ninspection on that IP address.\n\n71\n00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.290\nEither to make sure that address is\nresponding before I start go up port by\n\n72\n00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.220\nport through 365000 ports,\nright, so it's used for a lot\n\n73\n00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.390\ncan also be used maliciously as some,\nyou will see, do not respond to pings.\n\n74\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.961\nIf I ping www.google.com.\n\n75\n00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:02.630\n&gt;&gt; Ping, ping.\n\n76\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.300\n&gt;&gt; Did I ping ping?\n\n77\n00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.920\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n78\n00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.270\n&gt;&gt; Ping ping will not work.\n\n79\n00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.450\nThat is not the same thing.\n\n80\n00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.915\nThat is actually an attack, no.\n\n81\n00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:11.775\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go we can see Google is\n\n82\n00:04:11.775 --> 00:04:12.980\nresponding.\n\n83\n00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.600\nBut if I try to ping somebody\nlike Microsoft.com we'll\n\n84\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.760\nsee that that doesn't respond\nbecause they've chosen not to.\n\n85\n00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.100\nBecause there are several different\ntypes of attacks that can be used,\n\n86\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.020\nping with pings from\nsimple denial service.\n\n87\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.190\nPings actually carry a payload.\n\n88\n00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.610\nA lot of people don't realize there's\nabout 53 bytes, or something,\n\n89\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.980\nin a ping packet that I could use to\nshuttle information into a network if you\n\n90\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.020\nare allowing those ping packets.\n\n91\n00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.470\nA lot of times we use ping\njust to test connectivity.\n\n92\n00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.770\nI use it to test name resolution,\nmany times.\n\n93\n00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.100\nLike the fact that Microsoft\ndidn't respond is.\n\n94\n00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.940\nInformation.\n\n95\n00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.840\nBut, the fact that it was\nable to take the name.\n\n96\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.610\nCuz I pinged a name.\n\n97\n00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.370\nWell we know computers cannot talk names,\n\n98\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.680\nthey have to have an IP\naddress to communicate.\n\n99\n00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.340\nSo the first thing Ping does, is it\nresolves that name into an IP address.\n\n100\n00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.090\nAnd even though Microsoft didn't respond,\nI know my DNS is working.\n\n101\n00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.010\nRight, so there's a test in and of itself.\n\n102\n00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.680\nAnd so, again, this is Network+ stuff,\n\n103\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.250\nhopefully you guys are familiar\nwith just doing a quick rehash.\n\n104\n00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.154\nAnother one, Tracert, I say Tracert.\n\n105\n00:05:15.154 --> 00:05:17.210\n&gt;&gt; I say Tracer-T.\n\n106\n00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.470\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if that's the way.\n\n107\n00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.812\nYou say Trace-RT?\n\n108\n00:05:20.812 --> 00:05:24.426\n&gt;&gt; Tracer-T, like tracer then T.\n\n109\n00:05:24.426 --> 00:05:27.582\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so Tracer-T, gotcha.\n\n110\n00:05:29.944 --> 00:05:33.450\nOops, I'll just do a quick one\nwhile I'm talking about it here.\n\n111\n00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.480\nTraceroute is kind of a combination\nof path ping and ping.\n\n112\n00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.470\nIt'll go out, actually I take that back,\n\n113\n00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.240\npath ping is actually a combination\nof traceroute and ping.\n\n114\n00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.440\nBut traceroute looks at each\nhop in the path, right?\n\n115\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.460\nWhen I'm sending a packet out to Google It\ndoesn't go from my computer to Google,\n\n116\n00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.160\nit goes from my computer to\nour default gateway here which\n\n117\n00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.780\ngoes to our ISP's gateway.\n\n118\n00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.020\nWhich gets out there\neventually to the backbone and\n\n119\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.500\nbounces through a couple other routers.\n\n120\n00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.940\nIt gets close to wherever\nGoogle is located,\n\n121\n00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.020\nit starts getting to the closer network.\n\n122\n00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.270\nAnd then it gets into Google's network.\n\n123\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.110\nIt finally hits them and\nthen it comes back and\n\n124\n00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.580\nwhat this is doing is it's giving\nme information about each hop.\n\n125\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.790\nIn that path.\n\n126\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:14.420\nRight?\n\n127\n00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.450\nSo I can see that it\nleft our network here,\n\n128\n00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:23.250\nthen it went to GRU which is one of our,\nactually I think that's our gateway there.\n\n129\n00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.170\nThen it bounced up into Atlanta.\n\n130\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.020\nA couple more IP address here.\n\n131\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.810\nAnd then looks like somewhere\nalong the line they're\n\n132\n00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.270\nnot given any information back.\n\n133\n00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.090\nThe idea is that with TRACERT, I can\nsee the path that the packet is taking.\n\n134\n00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.230\nAnd if I'm doing something like this to\nGoogle, really the only information I'm\n\n135\n00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.360\ngonna get is I might figure out,\nwow, it's really slowing down here.\n\n136\n00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.730\nI see 1,000 milliseconds delay time,\nsomething's going on.\n\n137\n00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.170\nBut this is probably beyond my control.\n\n138\n00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.180\nThis is not anything that I can control.\n\n139\n00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.100\nBut in a heavily routed environment\nIf your network is heavily routed\n\n140\n00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.530\nthis can be very helpful because now there\nare devices that are under my control.\n\n141\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.710\nLet's say each one of your\nfloors is it's own subnet and\n\n142\n00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.885\nyou've got a router on each one and\npeople on the first,\n\n143\n00:07:08.885 --> 00:07:13.065\ntenth floor are having trouble printing or\nsending something down to the first floor.\n\n144\n00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:16.205\nAnd as you could figure out which router\nin the path is holding those packets or\n\n145\n00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:17.245\ndropping those packets.\n\n146\n00:07:17.245 --> 00:07:21.205\nSo that's where tracer can come into play,\nlet me kill that connection there.\n\n147\n00:07:23.765 --> 00:07:28.430\nLet's see what else got, ipconfig.\n\n148\n00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.170\nAgain, another one we should\nall be familiar with.\n\n149\n00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.210\nThis is gonna give me my\nTCP/IP configuration, so\n\n150\n00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.650\nI can verify that it's connected, or\nthat it's configured properly, or\n\n151\n00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.360\njust see what IP address I've got,\nor what my lease duration is, or\n\n152\n00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.120\nwhat my default gateway is set to.\n\n153\n00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.036\nJust verify your TCP/IP configuration.\n\n154\n00:07:47.036 --> 00:07:49.928\nYou can do an IP config, switch all, and\n\n155\n00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:54.526\nget more information back on\na Linux world, it is not IP config,\n\n156\n00:07:54.526 --> 00:07:59.067\nit's IF config for\nmost of our eunuch systems, but same idea.\n\n157\n00:07:59.067 --> 00:08:02.638\nIt's gonna give you your\nTCP/IP connectivity for\n\n158\n00:08:02.638 --> 00:08:05.220\nyour ethernet adapter, all right?\n\n159\n00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.670\nNS Lookup is another very powerful command\nline tool that we use all the time,\n\n160\n00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.805\nit's a way that I can\ntest name resolution.\n\n161\n00:08:11.805 --> 00:08:12.525\nIf I type in.\n\n162\n00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:13.975\nIt's got two different modes.\n\n163\n00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:17.105\nYou have the look interactive mode and\nthe non-interactive mode.\n\n164\n00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:19.895\nNslookup is used to test DNS.\n\n165\n00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:21.485\nSome people confuse that sometimes.\n\n166\n00:08:21.485 --> 00:08:24.545\nThey're not sure what exactly\nthey're testing with nslookup.\n\n167\n00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:27.445\nYou're testing what the DNS\nserver is handing out.\n\n168\n00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:32.390\nWhen I query DNS, I'm supposed to say,\nhey, what's the IP address of Google.com?\n\n169\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.410\nDNS is suppose to do it's job.\n\n170\n00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.960\nResolve Google.com into an IP address and\nreturn the IP address so\n\n171\n00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.360\nthat I can connect.\n\n172\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.180\nWhat if my DNS is giving\nout the wrong information?\n\n173\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.790\nAll right that's what\nI'm trying to verify.\n\n174\n00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.400\nMaybe we switched the IP\naddress of that file server but\n\n175\n00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.880\nthe DNS record didn't get updated.\n\n176\n00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.390\nNow nobody can connect.\n\n177\n00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.700\nI can't figure out why cause I can ping.\n\n178\n00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.100\nThe IP address of the file server,\neverybody should be able to get to it.\n\n179\n00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.270\nBut that's not where the problem lies.\n\n180\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.610\nThe problem is DNS never got updated so\n\n181\n00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.920\nthe old name record is pointing to the old\nIP address, how am I gonna know that?\n\n182\n00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.830\nWell, I type get an nslookup and ask DNS.\n\n183\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.518\nHey, what are you telling\neverybody when they ask you for\n\n184\n00:09:08.518 --> 00:09:10.206\nthe IP address of file server 01?\n\n185\n00:09:10.206 --> 00:09:14.280\nRight, that's what it's used for,\nyou could say nslookup google.com.\n\n186\n00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.880\nRight?\n\n187\n00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.580\nAnd what this look up is\ngonna do is tell you one,\n\n188\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.950\nwhat DNS server you're querying, right?\n\n189\n00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.650\nIt's gonna look at your\nTCPIP configuration and\n\n190\n00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.030\nuse that to get a server.\n\n191\n00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.810\nThere's a switch called Server\nthat you can just set server and\n\n192\n00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:27.720\nchange which server.\n\n193\n00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.370\nCuz if you had more than\none server in your network,\n\n194\n00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.110\nyou might wanna check\nwith each one of them.\n\n195\n00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.740\nThree of them might be giving\nout the right information, but\n\n196\n00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.330\none of them hasn't been\nreplicating properly.\n\n197\n00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.560\nAnd it's still giving\nout the old IP address.\n\n198\n00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.880\nSo you can switch what server you're\nasking, what you asked it, all right, and\n\n199\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.030\nthen the responses that\nthat server is giving out.\n\n200\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.120\nThat's noninteractive mode, because\nnotice I'm back to a normal prompt here.\n\n201\n00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.470\nIf I type in nslookup\nwithout any parameters,\n\n202\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.950\nI get into the interactive mode and\nthen I can do repetitive things, right?\n\n203\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.738\nI can say microsoft.com, and\n\n204\n00:10:02.738 --> 00:10:06.429\nI can say google.com.\n\n205\n00:10:06.429 --> 00:10:08.850\nSo I can keep going,\nI don't have to type NSLookup every time.\n\n206\n00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.010\nThat's what the interactive\nmode will do for you.\n\n207\n00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.410\nAgain, there's lots of things\nyou can do with NSLookup.\n\n208\n00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.780\nYou can switch record types.\n\n209\n00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:23.260\nI only want to pull back MX records or SOA\nrecords or whatever you are looking for.\n\n210\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.810\nDig is what we would use on the Linux\nside of things, again similar.\n\n211\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:33.150\nYour domain information says\nI have to go out and and\n\n212\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.850\ntalk to the DNS servers and find out\nwhat information they're giving back.\n\n213\n00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.760\nIn fact I've got a, it keeps saying it's\na Linux tool and I've got Linux over here.\n\n214\n00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.510\nCan you guys see that out there?\n\n215\n00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:47.350\nNegative?\n\n216\n00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.030\nWait, Daniel taught me the controls.\n\n217\n00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.520\nControl shift n plus.\n\n218\n00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.830\nAnd it's just, that's right,\nI keep having to use my mouse wheel.\n\n219\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.350\nThere we go.\n\n220\n00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.165\nYeah, you can tell I'm a Windows guy.\n\n221\n00:10:59.165 --> 00:11:00.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's see,\n\n222\n00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.570\nwhat'd we talk about?\n\n223\n00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.740\nDig, and, and let's look up,\nso dig on this system.\n\n224\n00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.490\nLet's say dig.\n\n225\n00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.180\nIf you do dig with no parameters\nit actually searches for\n\n226\n00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.030\nroot or dot that represents the root.\n\n227\n00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.410\nAnd so\nthere I can see all of the root servers.\n\n228\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:21.140\nBut to dig is a ITpro.tv.\n\n229\n00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.290\nI can see what that IP address is so\n\n230\n00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:29.050\nthat's our public IP address, what DNA\nserver I use when I made that query\n\n231\n00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.220\nI can see that authority is set to zero so\nthis was a non authoritative answer\n\n232\n00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.250\nmeaning that this server got\nthe answer from somebody else.\n\n233\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.310\nAnd you're just passing the answer along.\n\n234\n00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:43.170\nBut that, we'll save that for\nour DNS class.\n\n235\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.330\nWhat else do I wanna show you?\n\n236\n00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.780\nI'm on Linux, ifconfig.\n\n237\n00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:54.300\nRight, gives me that information about my\nEthernet adaptors in my Linux environment.\n\n238\n00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.260\nThere's one other thing\nI wanted to show you.\n\n239\n00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.240\nI love the way dig does\nthe reverse Like if\n\n240\n00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.308\nI do a dig-x 8.8.8.8,\n\n241\n00:12:06.308 --> 00:12:11.220\nit does a reverse lookup, and so i can\nsee that it's putting that reserve suffix\n\n242\n00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:16.220\nin ADERARPA, and it's telling me,\nthe name that's associated with that IP\n\n243\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.600\naddress Is google-public-dns-a.google.com,\nright?\n\n244\n00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.730\nWhy would I do this?\n\n245\n00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.550\nIn my log file, I might not have names,\nI might have IP addresses, and\n\n246\n00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.290\nI don't know what node on my\nnetwork has that IP address.\n\n247\n00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:33.640\nI could go to DHCP and thumb through\nthe leases there and try to figure it out.\n\n248\n00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.390\nOr I could just do a quick reverse lookup,\n\n249\n00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.700\nso I like the way I can\ndo that with dig there.\n\n250\n00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.000\nYou can do it with ping\nin a Windows environment.\n\n251\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.560\nWhat is it?\nDash a if I'm not mistaken\n\n252\n00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.870\nto do a reverse lookup on that.\n\n253\n00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.110\nWhat did you want to say, Dan?\n\n254\n00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.530\nTracer?\n\n255\n00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes, trace route.\n\n256\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:57.230\n&gt;&gt; Trace route, oops, not router, Google\n&gt;&gt; Dot\n\n257\n00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.970\ncom and you'll see it's gonna go\nthrough basically the same thing.\n\n258\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.690\nBut instead of trace RT,\nyou spell it out, trace route.\n\n259\n00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.289\nAll right, actually seeing as we go a lot\nfaster on Linux than I did on Windows.\n\n260\n00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.301\nAnd we'll kill that one there as well.\n\n261\n00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:15.433\nFor those of you that\nmight be paying attention,\n\n262\n00:13:15.433 --> 00:13:17.810\nyou see I finally got my alias for CLS.\n\n263\n00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:21.700\nSo I can clear the screen with\nmy Windows commands, woo hoo!\n\n264\n00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.760\nLet's see what else we've got.\n\n265\n00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.800\nSysinternals, Sysinternals Is fantastic,\nall right.\n\n266\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.820\nJust I love this journals.\n\n267\n00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.640\nBut they had a bunch of great tools.\n\n268\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.850\nI don't know how this.\n\n269\n00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.430\nThey are mostly command line to us.\n\n270\n00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.660\nI guess it's why they put that\nin this particular category.\n\n271\n00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.800\nI believe if marked in.\n\n272\n00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.011\nThere we go.\n\n273\n00:13:43.011 --> 00:13:46.242\nAnd it's a whole suite of tools,\nif you haven't played with these,\n\n274\n00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:47.950\nit was Sysinternals.\n\n275\n00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:53.665\nMark Russinovich, if I say his name\ncorrectly, saw him out at RSA this year.\n\n276\n00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:57.865\nDevelops externals, bought out,\nwent to work for Microsoft.\n\n277\n00:13:57.865 --> 00:14:01.235\nBecame Winternals,\nis what a lot of people will call it.\n\n278\n00:14:01.235 --> 00:14:03.165\nNow you'll see it's Windows Systernals.\n\n279\n00:14:03.165 --> 00:14:08.920\nBut just a suite of tools,\nthat are free, right?\n\n280\n00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.380\nI love these, like some of you probably\nhave used some of these PS Tools,\n\n281\n00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.300\nlike PS Exec,\nProcess Monitor's a great one,\n\n282\n00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.750\ngives you tons of information\nabout running processes,\n\n283\n00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:24.470\nmuch more than you would find in\nTask Manager, PS Info, PS Kill,\n\n284\n00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:29.880\nare just some of them that I've used, but\nyou can see there are a ton of tools here.\n\n285\n00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.840\nSysmon is a really cool tool.\n\n286\n00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.650\nThis is a system monitor\ntool that we can use\n\n287\n00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:41.510\nto monitor and log system\n\n288\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:46.875\nactivity to the Windows event log\nreally,really cool program there as well.\n\n289\n00:14:46.875 --> 00:14:49.795\nBut anyway systemera be familiar\nwith systemera understand that it is\n\n290\n00:14:49.795 --> 00:14:54.455\na Microsoft I don't want\nto say department, but\n\n291\n00:14:54.455 --> 00:14:56.535\nits all about Microsoft and\nthey put out a lot of really cool.\n\n292\n00:14:56.535 --> 00:15:01.420\nCool, security-related\ntools through there.\n\n293\n00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.850\nAnd then OpenSSL is another one,\n\n294\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:09.150\nOpenSSL is the SSL/TLS framework,\nor allows us to work with that.\n\n295\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:14.370\nSo if we wanna write an application\nthat's gonna use TLS or\n\n296\n00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.130\nSSL, we might be using OpenSSL.\n\n297\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.111\n&gt;&gt; For that its licensed under Apache\nstyle license which means you can use\n\n298\n00:15:22.111 --> 00:15:26.564\nit for commercial an non-commercial\npurchases.Purposes,not purchases.\n\n299\n00:15:26.564 --> 00:15:27.095\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n300\n00:15:27.095 --> 00:15:30.693\n&gt;&gt; Although you might use it for\npurchases after you,never mind.\n\n301\n00:15:30.693 --> 00:15:33.996\n&gt;&gt; Hope that you are purchasing\nsomething,you are using it.\n\n302\n00:15:33.996 --> 00:15:34.765\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n303\n00:15:34.765 --> 00:15:36.851\n&gt;&gt; That's where I was going with that,\n\n304\n00:15:36.851 --> 00:15:38.203\nall right, what else?\n\n305\n00:15:38.203 --> 00:15:41.480\nIntrusion detection intrusion\nprevention systems.\n\n306\n00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.320\nI think we've pretty much covered\nthat one and if you go back and\n\n307\n00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.100\nwatch part one of this show.\n\n308\n00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.500\nWe talked about that.\n\n309\n00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.305\nSo why is it here again?\n\n310\n00:15:49.305 --> 00:15:51.530\nWell, I don't know.\n\n311\n00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.780\n&gt;&gt; Like being redundant.\n\n312\n00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much, pretty much.\n\n313\n00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.455\nNo, all kidding aside.\n\n314\n00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:58.818\nWhen we talked about this,\nI was trying to go back and\n\n315\n00:15:58.818 --> 00:16:00.870\nsee where we've talked about this earlier.\n\n316\n00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.064\nI think it was one of the first one.\n\n317\n00:16:02.064 --> 00:16:03.365\nYeah, it was under preventative.\n\n318\n00:16:03.365 --> 00:16:03.963\nRight?\n\n319\n00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.005\nBecause it is.\n\n320\n00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:09.280\nIt is considered a preventative if\nyou're doing intrusion detection or\n\n321\n00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.020\nintrusion prevention\nthat can help prevent.\n\n322\n00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.003\nAt least the intrusion\nprevention can help prevent,\n\n323\n00:16:14.003 --> 00:16:16.990\nintrusion detection just let's\nyou know that something's going.\n\n324\n00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.700\nBut it can prevent furthering\nthe attack and spread of an attack.\n\n325\n00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.580\nSo in a way, it is preventative there.\n\n326\n00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.000\nBut it would also would\nbe considered collective,\n\n327\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.960\nbecause they are gathering information.\n\n328\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.720\nIt's monitoring your network and/or your\nsystems depending on how you have it\n\n329\n00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.370\nconfigured, whether it's network-based or\nhost-based.\n\n330\n00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.400\nSo it does fall under collective as well.\n\n331\n00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.290\nSo we won't go back and\nrehash all those tools, but\n\n332\n00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.780\njust understand that it does fit there.\n\n333\n00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:50.010\nThings like Bro and Snort and\nthose vulnerability scan,\n\n334\n00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.560\nI'm sorry, that actually,\nI've lost place in my notes, here.\n\n335\n00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.580\nAll right, so that was collected.\n\n336\n00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.530\nAnd then we get to analytical.\n\n337\n00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.500\nAnalytical, we're looking at,\nthey've got vulnerability scanners.\n\n338\n00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.068\nGive me the ability to analyze data.\n\n339\n00:17:01.068 --> 00:17:02.266\nThank you [INAUDIBLE].\n\n340\n00:17:02.266 --> 00:17:04.813\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The collective tools, they're gonna\n\n341\n00:17:04.813 --> 00:17:08.664\nmost likely show off our analytical\nbecause once I collect that data.\n\n342\n00:17:08.664 --> 00:17:10.035\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna analyse it.\n\n343\n00:17:10.035 --> 00:17:12.660\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise,\nwhy collect the data the first place?\n\n344\n00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.348\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; All this great data that we collect\n\n345\n00:17:14.348 --> 00:17:16.900\nis just gonna sit over there and\nforget about it.\n\n346\n00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.140\nNo, you're gonna look at it you're gonna\ngo hm-mm, that's interesting stuff, right?\n\n347\n00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.020\nIt's gonna give you an idea of what's\ngoing on inside of your network so\n\n348\n00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.230\nthat you can analyze,\nwhere are my weak spots, where can we,\n\n349\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.760\nlook, we have an actual active\nattack happening right here,\n\n350\n00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.220\nbecause my analytics have come back and\nshown me hey, that is happening.\n\n351\n00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.720\nAll through collecting,\nusing the exact same tool to do that with.\n\n352\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.470\nNow in their defense, the company's\ndefense, they do this, right?\n\n353\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:46.000\nWe've been kind of like joking about\nthis through out this mini series here\n\n354\n00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.660\nabout how, it's all in one.\n\n355\n00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:52.060\nThey're throwing everything on\ntop making it this one big giant\n\n356\n00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.660\nsystems that you can download.\n\n357\n00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:59.470\nYou don't have to aggregate tools so that\nyou can perform these data collection and\n\n358\n00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.510\nanalytics, you can just do it in one stop.\n\n359\n00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:02.650\nSo, that is happening.\n\n360\n00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:07.220\nI understand why they've separated\nthem out into different categories but\n\n361\n00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.670\nthey end up being the same tools.\n\n362\n00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.250\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so we won't go again,\nwe won't go back and rehash any of those,\n\n363\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.040\nbut vulnerability scans,\nQualsus, Nessus, OpenVAS,\n\n364\n00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.790\nNexpose, Nikto,\nMicrosoft Baseline Security Analyzer.\n\n365\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.590\nAll of those would fall\nunder analytical as well.\n\n366\n00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.190\nSo make sure you know that, all right?\n\n367\n00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.120\nCuz you get in the exam,\n\n368\n00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.616\nand they say, what's the tool you\nmight use to analyze this information.\n\n369\n00:18:31.616 --> 00:18:33.496\nThose, right?\n\n370\n00:18:33.496 --> 00:18:38.970\nMonitoring tools, they will be\nconsidered analytical as well.\n\n371\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:45.170\nThings like multi router, traffic grapher,\nNygos, SolarWinds is a big one,\n\n372\n00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:49.310\nthey've got some great products,\nsome free, some trial, some pay.\n\n373\n00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.930\nGo take a look at SolarWinds.\n\n374\n00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.890\nCacti is another one.\n\n375\n00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:59.670\nNetflow Analyzer is one, and they have\nit listed like it's its own tool.\n\n376\n00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:04.830\nRemember what NetFlow is, NetFlow is,\nit was a CISCO proprietary\n\n377\n00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:10.070\nprotocol used for gathering information\nfrom routers and firewalls.\n\n378\n00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:16.010\nAnd NetFlow Analyzer's something\nthat would take that information\n\n379\n00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.853\nthat's being collected from\nthose end point devices, or\n\n380\n00:19:19.853 --> 00:19:24.011\nthose interconnectivity devices and\nletting the analyzers,\n\n381\n00:19:24.011 --> 00:19:29.240\na few NetFlow analyzers out there,\nthere are some paid ones as well.\n\n382\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.500\nIn fact, I think I bookmarked one or two.\n\n383\n00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.155\nThere was one,\nI think it might have been SolarWinds.\n\n384\n00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.260\nHere is the multi router traffic grapher,\nall right?\n\n385\n00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.200\nMonitor SN and P network devices and\n\n386\n00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.420\ndraw pretty pictures showing how much\ntraffic has passed through each interface.\n\n387\n00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.173\n&gt;&gt; Does it really say\ndraw pretty pictures?\n\n388\n00:19:52.173 --> 00:19:54.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Toby's got\na sense of humor here.\n\n389\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.200\nYou have a router, you wanna know what it\ndoes all day long, then this is for you.\n\n390\n00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.920\nMonitor SNMP network devices,\nand draw pretty pictures,\n\n391\n00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.219\nshowing how much traffic has passed\nthrough each interface, right?\n\n392\n00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:09.420\n[COUGH] So, and that's open source,\nthat one's free.\n\n393\n00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.350\nSo that is one that you can go out and\nget.\n\n394\n00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.260\nIt's licensed under the IGN UGPL.\n\n395\n00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.620\nOther ones, Nagles.\n\n396\n00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.536\nLet's take a peek there.\n\n397\n00:20:22.881 --> 00:20:29.080\nAnd these are really starting to fall\ninto the lines of seam systems, right?\n\n398\n00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.350\nYou're talking system monitoring,\nprotocol monitoring,\n\n399\n00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.850\napplication monitoring,\ndatabase monitoring.\n\n400\n00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.220\nDepending on what it is you wanna do.\n\n401\n00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.380\nLet's see if I can find\nanything good on those guys.\n\n402\n00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.510\nYeah, they've got a nice trial,\nyou can request a demo there.\n\n403\n00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:50.638\nBut yeah, this really starts to blur the\nlines, cuz it's really like a SIEM system.\n\n404\n00:20:50.638 --> 00:20:54.640\nWhat else, SolarWinds, I mentioned,\nlet's go check out their webpage,\n\n405\n00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.310\ngive them credit as well.\n\n406\n00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.360\nThey have several tools.\n\n407\n00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.476\nThis one is their network monitor.\n\n408\n00:21:08.415 --> 00:21:10.300\nLet's take a look,\nthere you got free downloads.\n\n409\n00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:15.240\nThey do have some free software,\nthis network bandwidth analyzer.\n\n410\n00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.320\nYou can get a trial from some of those.\n\n411\n00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.830\nAs you can see here, they've got\ntheir network performance monitor.\n\n412\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.653\nLog and events, they've got a seam\nsystem there you can try for free,\n\n413\n00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:29.620\nsome database management software.\n\n414\n00:21:31.592 --> 00:21:33.630\nYeah, so\nI don't know where I was going with that.\n\n415\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.980\nBut anyway, SolarWinds,\n\n416\n00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.540\na lot of great products there as\nfar as the analytical partners go.\n\n417\n00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.590\nI mean they have really good stuff\nthat will map out your network,\n\n418\n00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.430\nit will pull logs in.\n\n419\n00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.180\nAnd what's really impressive\nabout SolarWinds is the interface\n\n420\n00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.780\nthat you get with it,\nvery easy to look at.\n\n421\n00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.360\nWhat else?\n\n422\n00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.750\nCacti I mentioned, NetFlow Analyzer.\n\n423\n00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.710\nInterception proxies,\nthese fall under a couple of categories,\n\n424\n00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.870\none of them being analytical as well.\n\n425\n00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.890\nAnd interception proxy,\nwe've talked about what a proxy is.\n\n426\n00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.920\nIt's a middleman,\nsomebody that sits in-between and\n\n427\n00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.330\ndoes something on behalf of someone or\nsomething else.\n\n428\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:13.080\nAn interception proxy is really just\nsaying, hey, I've already got this data.\n\n429\n00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.940\nIt's going through me coming\nfrom this over and then out.\n\n430\n00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.470\nSo like when Daniel was the proxy,\n\n431\n00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.900\nmy web request went through him\non its way out to the Internet.\n\n432\n00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.410\nWhat if Daniel decided to take a little\ncloser look at that data that I was\n\n433\n00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:27.610\nsending through him?\n\n434\n00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.290\nWhat if he stopped it and said, hm-mm,\n\n435\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.890\nmaybe I could change this a little bit,\nright?\n\n436\n00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.480\nNow we're talking interception proxy.\n\n437\n00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.200\nReally didn't change what the proxy was\ndoing, it's still proxying for you.\n\n438\n00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.370\nSo yeah, determine interception.\n\n439\n00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.070\nWill the proxy intercepts,\nthat's what a proxy does.\n\n440\n00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.840\nBut usually when we say\ninterception proxy,\n\n441\n00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.960\nwe mean a little more than just\na normal web proxy, all right?\n\n442\n00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.400\nNow, we're saying that's it's\ngonna maybe stop the traffic,\n\n443\n00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.420\ngive me a chance to actually look at it,\npossibly maybe even make changes to it.\n\n444\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.110\nBut Burp Suite is a great one.\n\n445\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.580\nAnd it's again, it's got a free version.\n\n446\n00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:09.410\nIt was free,\nfree it's no longer free, free.\n\n447\n00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:14.540\nNow they have one of each, they've\n\n448\n00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.830\ngot their free edition and\ntheir professional edition.\n\n449\n00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:21.235\nAnd the professional edition is\ngonna give you a few more features.\n\n450\n00:23:21.235 --> 00:23:23.700\nBut Burp Suite is fantastic.\n\n451\n00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:29.300\nIt lets you intercept that web traffic,\nstop it on its way through, look at it,\n\n452\n00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.900\nand then either pass it on or potentially\neven make changes to that information.\n\n453\n00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:39.870\nOther ones you can do, OWASP has their,\nwhat's it called, ZAP.\n\n454\n00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.470\nLet's go check that one out.\n\n455\n00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.570\nZed attack proxy.\n\n456\n00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.648\nI believe, yeah, there we go.\n\n457\n00:23:48.089 --> 00:23:53.460\nOWASP, Zed Attack Proxy,\nis another free one that we can use.\n\n458\n00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:59.409\nVega would be another example,\nV-E-G-A, an interception proxy.\n\n459\n00:23:59.409 --> 00:24:01.855\nThen we get into the exploit categories.\n\n460\n00:24:01.855 --> 00:24:04.137\nSo we leave the analytical,\nwe get into exploit.\n\n461\n00:24:04.137 --> 00:24:10.140\nAnd guess what we started with VerbSuite,\nZap, and Vega, right?\n\n462\n00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:14.900\nThese again these are used to exploit\nas well because what did I just say,\n\n463\n00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.700\nthat interception proxy could even give\nyou a chance to make changes to the data\n\n464\n00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.670\nas it's going through.\n\n465\n00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:26.254\nI see that, yeah, that wouldn't\nwork I better use another example.\n\n466\n00:24:26.254 --> 00:24:28.785\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n467\n00:24:28.785 --> 00:24:29.703\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking better than that.\n\n468\n00:24:29.703 --> 00:24:34.091\nYeah, on second thought,\nso it does fall under\n\n469\n00:24:34.091 --> 00:24:39.137\nthe exploit as well because\nI might be modifying some of\n\n470\n00:24:39.137 --> 00:24:44.313\nthat web traffic as it goes by or\nnot allowing it to go by.\n\n471\n00:24:44.313 --> 00:24:46.590\nAnd just giving it a denial\nof service at the least.\n\n472\n00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.388\nBut yeah, same thing VerbSuite, Zap, Vega.\n\n473\n00:24:48.388 --> 00:24:52.200\nWe're gonna take a look at\na couple of these tools as well.\n\n474\n00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.630\nI'll go through and we'll do some\ndemonstrations, some of the free ones, and\n\n475\n00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.950\nmaybe a couple of the trials.\n\n476\n00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:01.920\nThe problem with some of these is\nlike the trials for say, AlienVault.\n\n477\n00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.370\nNormally these are appliances that you're\ngetting that have dedicated processor,\n\n478\n00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.910\ngood amounts of memory.\n\n479\n00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:13.890\nNice, fast and you get their trial and\na VM and it can really choke your machine.\n\n480\n00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:18.339\nI mean this bad boy I've got right here,\nthis 75, 10 has quite a bit of memory,\n\n481\n00:25:18.339 --> 00:25:19.943\nit's a pretty good machine.\n\n482\n00:25:19.943 --> 00:25:26.100\nAnd I will tell you AlienVault is\nkilling it [LAUGH] resource wise.\n\n483\n00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.950\nSo just keep that in mind if you're gonna\nget some of these trials make sure you\n\n484\n00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:33.000\nhave the system requirements\nto pull it off.\n\n485\n00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.050\nI don't want anybody going out\nthere saying, that one's terrible.\n\n486\n00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:37.290\nWell it wasn't the product's terrible,\n\n487\n00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.430\nit's because you're trying to put in\na VM that wasn't designed to do that.\n\n488\n00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.080\nAnyway, I digress get\nback to our topic here.\n\n489\n00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:43.990\nSo exploit framework,\n\n490\n00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.860\nwe're gonna take a look at these\nin a couple episodes coming up.\n\n491\n00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.099\nMetasploit, NeXpose,\nthese are the ones we always think of.\n\n492\n00:25:50.099 --> 00:25:51.980\nNeXpose, we've already talked about,\nright?\n\n493\n00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:57.830\nThat's actually a vulnerability scanner,\nRapid7, but it ties right into Metasploit.\n\n494\n00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:03.329\nYou can use NeXpose to discover the\nvulnerability, and then take Metasploit.\n\n495\n00:26:03.329 --> 00:26:07.521\nAnd have it find the exploit that can\ntake advantage of that particular\n\n496\n00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:11.800\nvulnerability, wrap it up for you in\na pretty bow and send it on its way.\n\n497\n00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.600\nSo they really work well together,\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n498\n00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.070\nAnd we talk about the exploit frameworks,\nit's just that.\n\n499\n00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.151\nIt's the framework that\nwe can write exploits\n\n500\n00:26:20.151 --> 00:26:22.839\nto take advantage of vulnerabilities.\n\n501\n00:26:22.839 --> 00:26:29.916\nFuzzers, another exploit that we need\nto talk about, be familiar with.\n\n502\n00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:34.825\nWe talked about the importance of, when we\nwere talking about application security,\n\n503\n00:26:34.825 --> 00:26:37.345\nwe talked about input validation.\n\n504\n00:26:37.345 --> 00:26:41.945\nAnd anytime that we're gonna have a form,\nespecially a web form where the public\n\n505\n00:26:41.945 --> 00:26:47.115\ncan come in and put data, but any type of\ndata acceptance and any types of form.\n\n506\n00:26:47.115 --> 00:26:48.645\nWe need to make sure we're sanitizing and\n\n507\n00:26:48.645 --> 00:26:51.215\nthat we're inspecting the data\nthat's being sent back.\n\n508\n00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:53.155\nHopefully before it ever\nleaves the web server,\n\n509\n00:26:53.155 --> 00:26:56.011\ndefinitely before it gets to my back ends.\n\n510\n00:26:56.011 --> 00:27:00.884\nWell fuzzers allow me to test\napplications to see what would happen\n\n511\n00:27:00.884 --> 00:27:04.365\nif somebody putting in\nnumbers in a named deal or\n\n512\n00:27:04.365 --> 00:27:09.690\nsomebody putting in letters in a text,\nin a phone number field, right?\n\n513\n00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.380\nWhat would that do to the application?\n\n514\n00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.903\nWould it try to put that\nin to the database, and\n\n515\n00:27:13.903 --> 00:27:17.093\nthe database field is actually\nset to numeric or integer.\n\n516\n00:27:17.093 --> 00:27:20.263\nAnd now I can't store those letters and\nthe application crashes or\n\n517\n00:27:20.263 --> 00:27:22.820\nthe server crashes, and\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n518\n00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.900\nI need to know these kinds of things.\n\n519\n00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.428\nDaniel, you wrote your own fuzzers, right?\n\n520\n00:27:26.428 --> 00:27:27.261\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did.\n\n521\n00:27:27.261 --> 00:27:30.506\nIt can take a little bit of time and\neffort but you never know.\n\n522\n00:27:30.506 --> 00:27:32.680\nYou can get a little handy\nwith the scripting or\n\n523\n00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.420\nwith the little bit of programming.\n\n524\n00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.103\nIt's not too difficult to do.\n\n525\n00:27:36.103 --> 00:27:40.440\n&gt;&gt; There's definitely some\nout there that you can get.\n\n526\n00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.220\nCuz Daniel, he wrote his own and\nreally all you're doing is you're throwing\n\n527\n00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.520\nrandom strings of characters and\nnumber added.\n\n528\n00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.130\nSo you'd have to get to write\nsome scripts to do that.\n\n529\n00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:54.072\nBut you can look at untidy used to be,\nI don't wanna say it was the first one.\n\n530\n00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:57.410\nIt was one of the first ones,\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n531\n00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.280\nIt's an older one,\nit's one that's been around for a while.\n\n532\n00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.673\nAnd it's no longer around,\nat least, I can't find it.\n\n533\n00:28:04.673 --> 00:28:11.570\nBut the Peach Fuzzer is, which is\nactually using untidy Essence Engine.\n\n534\n00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:17.670\nSo it kinda evolved into,\nlet me go pull that up for you guys.\n\n535\n00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.517\nHere, three it is.\n\n536\n00:28:20.517 --> 00:28:25.634\nWell, that's not gonna work.\n\n537\n00:28:25.634 --> 00:28:28.900\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n538\n00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.287\nSo here's the untidy XML Fuzzer,\nas I said it's not,\n\n539\n00:28:32.287 --> 00:28:35.763\nI don't believe it's being\nsupported at all anymore.\n\n540\n00:28:35.763 --> 00:28:42.359\nIf you try to go to the untidy website,\nit's no longer there under SourceForge,\n\n541\n00:28:42.359 --> 00:28:46.340\nbut if we go take a look\na look at the Peach Fuzzer.\n\n542\n00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.394\nI like that name, Peach Fuzzer.\n\n543\n00:28:51.394 --> 00:28:57.390\n[COUGH] All right, I wanna say that\nsomewhere on here they actually tell you.\n\n544\n00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.860\nMaybe they don't,\nthat it evolve from untidy.\n\n545\n00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.364\nBut this is the commercial\nversion of whats untidy became.\n\n546\n00:29:06.364 --> 00:29:08.140\nSo this is a commercial great Fuzzer.\n\n547\n00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:16.452\nThen you've got Microsoft's SDL Regex\nFuzzer of another example of a fuzzer.\n\n548\n00:29:16.452 --> 00:29:19.868\nAnd there's different ones depending\non what you're trying to fuzz.\n\n549\n00:29:19.868 --> 00:29:23.870\nYou might look at different types\nof fuzzers or write your own.\n\n550\n00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.650\nLast thing,\nI know Daniel's giving me the evil eye.\n\n551\n00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:27.425\nWe're about out of time here.\n\n552\n00:29:27.425 --> 00:29:29.780\nLet's see what we got left,\nwe're almost done, Daniel.\n\n553\n00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:30.940\nI think we can squeeze it in.\n\n554\n00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.266\n&gt;&gt; Let's go for it,\nlet's make it a marathon.\n\n555\n00:29:32.266 --> 00:29:32.844\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n556\n00:29:32.844 --> 00:29:33.711\n&gt;&gt; Sprint to the end.\n\n557\n00:29:33.711 --> 00:29:34.544\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n\n558\n00:29:34.544 --> 00:29:37.240\nForensics suites are next,\nthere are several of them.\n\n559\n00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:44.310\nIn case is probably the biggest one that\nmost people are gonna be familiar with.\n\n560\n00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:47.490\nBut it's also one that you're not\ngonna get your hands on readily.\n\n561\n00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:51.523\nIt's a very expensive,\nI say relative, right?\n\n562\n00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:55.770\nExpense is relative depends on what you're\ngetting out and what you're using for it.\n\n563\n00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.707\nBut in cases like the de facto when\nit comes to Forensics tools, this is\n\n564\n00:29:59.707 --> 00:30:04.113\nthe one that almost every court system\nwill accept at least here in the States,\n\n565\n00:30:04.113 --> 00:30:05.272\nI know they accept.\n\n566\n00:30:05.272 --> 00:30:07.870\nBut it's the one that most of\nthe law enforcement agencies use.\n\n567\n00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.917\nSo what is a Forensics Suite?\n\n568\n00:30:09.917 --> 00:30:16.470\nWell what we've talked about doing\nForensics on systems, right?\n\n569\n00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.630\nThe process we have to go through,\nyou've got to block off the scene.\n\n570\n00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.180\nYou've got to collect evidence,\nyou've got to analyze that evidence.\n\n571\n00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.210\nYou've got to maintain chains of custody.\n\n572\n00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:28.635\nYou've got to report on data you've found,\nsteps you've taken, what you've taken,\n\n573\n00:30:28.635 --> 00:30:29.292\nall of this.\n\n574\n00:30:29.292 --> 00:30:31.167\nHow do I keep that all organized?\n\n575\n00:30:31.167 --> 00:30:35.563\nAs a case grows and becomes more complex,\nthe evidence just keeps piling up.\n\n576\n00:30:35.563 --> 00:30:37.590\nThe information keeps piling up.\n\n577\n00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.750\nThese forensics suites help\nus create that case and\n\n578\n00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:45.010\nkeep all of these organized and\nwork through have a work flow\n\n579\n00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:49.520\nthat we actually go through as\nwe're doing computer forensics.\n\n580\n00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.050\nSo that's what encase for,\nif you're in a law professional,\n\n581\n00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.130\nif you're a law professional.\n\n582\n00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.823\nIf you're doing forensics\nwork as a professional.\n\n583\n00:30:56.823 --> 00:31:00.378\nSo you're gonna have something like\nthis to keep your cases organized\n\n584\n00:31:00.378 --> 00:31:03.460\ncuz you're not working on one\nproject at a time most likely.\n\n585\n00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:10.258\nWhen you do an image of a drive and\nyou do some analysis on it.\n\n586\n00:31:10.258 --> 00:31:13.520\nYou've got to make sure that's\ngonna accepted in a court\n\n587\n00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.890\nof law in case it's proven itself and\nit's one that is.\n\n588\n00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.163\nFTK is the gosh,\n\n589\n00:31:20.163 --> 00:31:25.079\nbrain cramp there with FTK is the-\n&gt;&gt; Forensics toolkit?\n\n590\n00:31:25.079 --> 00:31:25.903\n&gt;&gt; Toolkit yes, thank you.\n\n591\n00:31:25.903 --> 00:31:27.882\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Forensics toolkit, wow.\n\n592\n00:31:27.882 --> 00:31:28.635\nThat was a tough one to remember.\n\n593\n00:31:28.635 --> 00:31:29.878\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n594\n00:31:29.878 --> 00:31:31.124\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What are we talking about?\n\n595\n00:31:31.124 --> 00:31:33.159\nForensics toolkits,\nI wonder what FTK stands for?\n\n596\n00:31:33.159 --> 00:31:33.785\n&gt;&gt; That's a toughie.\n\n597\n00:31:33.785 --> 00:31:34.446\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n598\n00:31:34.446 --> 00:31:35.849\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah.\n\n599\n00:31:35.849 --> 00:31:37.601\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Fast Turtle Kit.\n\n600\n00:31:37.601 --> 00:31:40.152\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's what I was gonna with,\n\n601\n00:31:40.152 --> 00:31:41.473\nbut I somehow-\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n602\n00:31:41.473 --> 00:31:42.908\n&gt;&gt; I just knew it was wrong.\n\n603\n00:31:42.908 --> 00:31:46.062\n&gt;&gt; It's just gettting-\n&gt;&gt; So yes, FDK is another one,\n\n604\n00:31:46.062 --> 00:31:49.346\nI'm pretty sure I've bookmarked\nthose guys for us as well.\n\n605\n00:31:49.346 --> 00:31:52.888\nCome on, Mr. Browser, come on with me.\n\n606\n00:31:52.888 --> 00:31:57.052\nLet's go take a look at EnCase real quick.\n\n607\n00:31:57.052 --> 00:32:04.470\nThere's the website for EnCase, the gold\nstandard in digital investigations.\n\n608\n00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:07.575\nThen we're going to look at-\n&gt;&gt; Ironically it costs gold to get it.\n\n609\n00:32:07.575 --> 00:32:09.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I mean,\n\n610\n00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:14.502\nyou pretty much have to prove that you\nare, that you should be using it, right?\n\n611\n00:32:14.502 --> 00:32:16.813\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That you are part of a law enforcement\n\n612\n00:32:16.813 --> 00:32:18.089\nagency to even get it.\n\n613\n00:32:18.089 --> 00:32:23.220\nThey offer their own training in any case,\nit's pretty impressive software.\n\n614\n00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.740\nThe Forensics toolkit is\nanother one recognized around\n\n615\n00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.710\nthe world as the standard digital\nforensics investigation suite.\n\n616\n00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:33.400\nSo we'll have to put them toe\nto to with EnCase somewhere.\n\n617\n00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.851\nAgain, both of you, to send me a trial,\nand we will take a look at that.\n\n618\n00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:37.893\n&gt;&gt; We will test that theory.\n\n619\n00:32:37.893 --> 00:32:38.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We will.\n\n620\n00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.088\n&gt;&gt; See who comes out on top.\n\n621\n00:32:40.088 --> 00:32:43.630\n&gt;&gt; We'll put them in a battle and\nsee who comes out on top.\n\n622\n00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:44.491\nWhat did I just do?\n\n623\n00:32:44.491 --> 00:32:45.700\nGosh knows where I ended up going.\n\n624\n00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:54.757\nLike I know that site by heart,\nlet me find, there we go, right?\n\n625\n00:32:54.757 --> 00:32:59.659\nHelix is by e-fense Carpe datum,\nnice title there.\n\n626\n00:32:59.659 --> 00:33:06.179\nAgain just another forensics suite, and\nagain the idea behind a Forensics toolkit.\n\n627\n00:33:06.179 --> 00:33:09.729\nOr a Forensics suite is that it gives\nme what I need to do a forensics\n\n628\n00:33:09.729 --> 00:33:10.710\ninvestigation.\n\n629\n00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:15.806\nYeah, it allows me to do my analysis,\norganize my data,\n\n630\n00:33:15.806 --> 00:33:21.371\ngenerate evidence numbers, tag numbers,\nfollow evidence to a chain of custody,\n\n631\n00:33:21.371 --> 00:33:25.040\nkeep all reinforce together,\ncreate final reports.\n\n632\n00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.595\nMake it presentable for\n\n633\n00:33:26.595 --> 00:33:30.878\nprosecution if we need to,\nthat's the idea behind these tools.\n\n634\n00:33:30.878 --> 00:33:34.630\nSysinternals they've actually got\nSysinternals this is forensics because it\n\n635\n00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.151\ndoes have a few of those tools\nthat we can use for that.\n\n636\n00:33:37.151 --> 00:33:42.036\nCellebrite is another one, and\nthen hashing algorithms or hashers,\n\n637\n00:33:42.036 --> 00:33:44.868\ndefinitely need these in our toolkits.\n\n638\n00:33:44.868 --> 00:33:51.960\nThese are tools that you need to\nbe familiar with, md5sum, sha1sum.\n\n639\n00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:56.933\nThey have,\ndon't worry they do have SHA-256,\n\n640\n00:33:56.933 --> 00:34:00.443\n512 and things like that as well.\n\n641\n00:34:00.443 --> 00:34:04.267\nBut these are just tools you can\nuse to generate hash values.\n\n642\n00:34:04.267 --> 00:34:07.700\nRemember what we use hash values for,\ndata integrity.\n\n643\n00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.601\nSo when I run,\n\n644\n00:34:08.601 --> 00:34:13.970\nwhen I make an image of that drive that\nI'm gonna do my forensics analysis on.\n\n645\n00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:20.450\nI need to make sure that my copy\nis the exact same as the original.\n\n646\n00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:22.000\nHow do I prove that?\n\n647\n00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.129\nI run check sums on those guys, right?\n\n648\n00:34:24.129 --> 00:34:28.300\nIt can be a file, a volume,\na folder, an entire drive.\n\n649\n00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.580\nBut things like md5sum, shasum\n\n650\n00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.880\nallow me to generate the appropriate\nhash value and check for data integrity.\n\n651\n00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.740\nWe got password crackers John the Ripper,\nand Cain and Abel,\n\n652\n00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.890\nboth great ones that have been around for\nawhile.\n\n653\n00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:44.045\nI know you've played with both of them,\ngood tools there.\n\n654\n00:34:44.045 --> 00:34:48.567\nDifferent password cracking and then,\n\n655\n00:34:48.567 --> 00:34:53.892\nDD is actually,\ndo you know what DD stands for?\n\n656\n00:34:53.892 --> 00:34:54.986\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I never did look that up.\n\n657\n00:34:54.986 --> 00:34:58.156\nIt's an incredibly old-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] thing is you just always\n\n658\n00:34:58.156 --> 00:34:59.560\ncall it by is acronym, DD, so.\n\n659\n00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n660\n00:35:00.125 --> 00:35:01.505\n&gt;&gt; Unless you've been around,\nI'll be honest.\n\n661\n00:35:01.505 --> 00:35:04.340\n&gt;&gt; You don't have my\nscreen up just in case,\n\n662\n00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.878\nI never know what's gonna come up\nwhen I do these Google searches.\n\n663\n00:35:08.878 --> 00:35:09.540\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if\n\n664\n00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.342\nit actually has, is it Disk Duplicater?\n\n665\n00:35:10.342 --> 00:35:10.918\nLet's see.\nDD,\n\n666\n00:35:10.918 --> 00:35:15.232\nsometimes calls DD\nthe oldest imaging tool.\n\n667\n00:35:15.232 --> 00:35:18.428\n&gt;&gt; The main page just has convert and\ncopy a file.\n\n668\n00:35:18.428 --> 00:35:19.443\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n669\n00:35:19.443 --> 00:35:22.182\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't say anything\njust in the description,\n\n670\n00:35:22.182 --> 00:35:25.888\nDD uses utility copies as the standard\ninput, the standard output.\n\n671\n00:35:25.888 --> 00:35:28.466\n&gt;&gt; Nothing about the etymology of DDT.\n\n672\n00:35:28.466 --> 00:35:29.274\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n673\n00:35:29.274 --> 00:35:30.685\nif anybody out there has history on that,\n\n674\n00:35:30.685 --> 00:35:32.232\nmake sure you just drop\nus a little line here.\n\n675\n00:35:32.232 --> 00:35:33.042\n&gt;&gt; I'll bet Don knows.\n\n676\n00:35:33.042 --> 00:35:34.780\n&gt;&gt; And we'll give you a credit for\nthat or something.\n\n677\n00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.197\nYeah, Don probably does know.\n\n678\n00:35:36.197 --> 00:35:39.019\nBut DD, I'm gonna say,\nit stands for disk duplicator.\n\n679\n00:35:39.019 --> 00:35:41.298\nIt probably doesn't, but\nthat's what we can use it for.\n\n680\n00:35:41.298 --> 00:35:46.170\nIt can actually make a forensically\nsound image, a bit by bit image.\n\n681\n00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:50.330\nCuz what it's doing is, it's not making,\nwhen we think about forensics images,\n\n682\n00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.140\na couple things I wanna mention here.\n\n683\n00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.352\nI know we're way out of time but\nwhen we're talking about making\n\n684\n00:35:55.352 --> 00:35:58.462\na forensics image,\nwe could make a backup of a drive, right?\n\n685\n00:35:58.462 --> 00:36:01.777\nUsing your normal,\nmaybe imaging software or\n\n686\n00:36:01.777 --> 00:36:06.459\nyou can use something like DD that\nmakes a bit by bit image of that.\n\n687\n00:36:06.459 --> 00:36:11.712\nAnd what is the difference and\nwhy is one better than the other?\n\n688\n00:36:11.712 --> 00:36:16.578\nWhen I do a back up of a drive,\nI can restore that to a drive, so\n\n689\n00:36:16.578 --> 00:36:18.972\nI do have a copy of that drive.\n\n690\n00:36:18.972 --> 00:36:23.710\nAnd I could restore it to another disk,\nwhether it's virtual or physical.\n\n691\n00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:27.920\nBut the problem is when you do that it\ncould potentially change things, right?\n\n692\n00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.015\nThe metadata about that drive and\neverything is gonna change a little bit,\n\n693\n00:36:32.015 --> 00:36:34.620\nthat's gonna make it\nnot forensically sound.\n\n694\n00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.082\nWhereas when we create a bit by bit image\nof that drive, we're getting every bit off\n\n695\n00:36:39.082 --> 00:36:43.307\nthat drive, including the metadata,\nthe stuff outside the volume, right?\n\n696\n00:36:43.307 --> 00:36:48.564\nThe unallocated space, the slack space,\nwe get all of that, right?\n\n697\n00:36:48.564 --> 00:36:52.785\nAnd when we analyze that we're not putting\nit back on a drive, so we can still get\n\n698\n00:36:52.785 --> 00:36:56.560\naccess to everything the way it was\nwhen it was on the physical disk.\n\n699\n00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.520\nBecause it's getting\nunderneath the file system.\n\n700\n00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.140\nDoesn't care what the file system is,\ndoesn't care the file structure, whatever.\n\n701\n00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.758\nIt's underneath it just saying okay a one,\na zero, zero, a one, a one, a zero,\n\n702\n00:37:05.758 --> 00:37:06.448\nzero, right?\n\n703\n00:37:06.448 --> 00:37:08.600\nNo idea about what's on the upper level.\n\n704\n00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:13.298\nSo that's why we use tools like this\nto create those what they call bit\n\n705\n00:37:13.298 --> 00:37:16.951\nby bit images and\nDD is one that's been used forever.\n\n706\n00:37:16.951 --> 00:37:21.032\nThere's definitely others that we can use,\nbut DD is the one they call out here.\n\n707\n00:37:21.032 --> 00:37:25.504\nSo lot's of tools again, keep in mind as\nyou're watching these episodes, we don't\n\n708\n00:37:25.504 --> 00:37:29.910\nexpect you to go out and learn everything\nyou can about every one of these programs.\n\n709\n00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.007\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n[LAUGH]\n\n710\n00:37:31.007 --> 00:37:32.024\n&gt;&gt; Daniel does, so\n\n711\n00:37:32.024 --> 00:37:33.699\nif you wanna be his friend.\n\n712\n00:37:33.699 --> 00:37:38.456\nNo, what we want you to do is just have\na general idea of specifically these tools\n\n713\n00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:43.450\ncuz they are called out in the objectives\nand what they do, where I might use them?\n\n714\n00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:48.650\nSo if they ask me a question about, you're\nin this stage of an investigation or\n\n715\n00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:52.290\nyou're attempting to do this,\nwhat tool would be your go to tool?\n\n716\n00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.990\nAnd they give you a few different tools,\nyou know which one to go.\n\n717\n00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:56.429\nYou might never of used it before, right?\n\n718\n00:37:56.429 --> 00:37:57.799\nNever seen it fired up.\n\n719\n00:37:57.799 --> 00:38:02.618\nBut you know that in case a forensic\nsuite that I can use in a cyber criminal\n\n720\n00:38:02.618 --> 00:38:07.121\ninvestigation under a forensics\ninvestigation on a workstation or\n\n721\n00:38:07.121 --> 00:38:08.360\nsomething.\n\n722\n00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.050\nThat's what we need to\nknow out of all of this.\n\n723\n00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.551\nSo hopefully, you've got that from\nthese last couple of episodes.\n\n724\n00:38:12.551 --> 00:38:14.309\n&gt;&gt; And [NOISE] right?\n\n725\n00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:16.813\nLots of information,\nthis is definitely one of those,\n\n726\n00:38:16.813 --> 00:38:19.064\nlet's drink from the firehose\nkind of episodes.\n\n727\n00:38:19.064 --> 00:38:23.850\nOr little series on this list of\ncyber security tools that you might\n\n728\n00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.310\nneed to be aware of.\n\n729\n00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.848\nBut it's just the fact of the matter if\nyou gonna get into the cyber security,\n\n730\n00:38:28.848 --> 00:38:30.099\nyou got to speak the lingo,\n\n731\n00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:32.944\nyou got to know the tools that\nare involved in during that job.\n\n732\n00:38:32.944 --> 00:38:35.411\nMike is anything else we need to\ncover before we call it quits?\n\n733\n00:38:35.411 --> 00:38:38.986\n&gt;&gt; I did wanna make mention, because\nI saw in the chat room there that we\n\n734\n00:38:38.986 --> 00:38:41.708\ndid have one response to\nour what does DD stand for?\n\n735\n00:38:41.708 --> 00:38:47.141\nDavid says that deadly duplicator,\nI could actually believe that.\n\n736\n00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:48.754\n&gt;&gt; I think it's actually like a joke.\n\n737\n00:38:48.754 --> 00:38:49.710\n&gt;&gt; There is a joke.\n\n738\n00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.571\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They call it the data destroyer.\n\n739\n00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:55.171\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because it's command line utility and\n\n740\n00:38:55.171 --> 00:38:56.889\nthere are no safety checks.\n\n741\n00:38:56.889 --> 00:38:57.900\n&gt;&gt; You make a mistake.\n\n742\n00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.160\n&gt;&gt; If you switch source and\ndestination drive or something like that.\n\n743\n00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.531\n&gt;&gt; Say bye-bye to data.\n\n744\n00:39:02.531 --> 00:39:03.506\n&gt;&gt; Gone, right?\n\n745\n00:39:03.506 --> 00:39:05.698\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I have heard it called the data\n\n746\n00:39:05.698 --> 00:39:09.787\ndestroyer and I could go with deadly\nduplicator as well, I like that.\n\n747\n00:39:09.787 --> 00:39:11.129\nSo just wanna throw that in there.\n\n748\n00:39:11.129 --> 00:39:11.655\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff.\n\n749\n00:39:11.655 --> 00:39:13.244\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, everyone thanks for\n\n750\n00:39:13.244 --> 00:39:15.157\njoining us today but\nit's time for us to sign off.\n\n751\n00:39:15.157 --> 00:39:17.967\nFor ITPro.TV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n752\n00:39:17.967 -->

00:00:08.196\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.196 --> 00:00:12.061\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:12.684\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n6\n00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:17.300\ngreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.730\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.210\nin today's episode we're back with\nmore of our CSA Plus series and\n\n9\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.080\nof course joining me in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.940\nMike, welcome back sir.\n\n11\n00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.780\nHow goes it today?\n\n12\n00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.960\n&gt;&gt; It goes fantastic Daniel,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.650\nExcited to be here, continuing on\nas you said with our CSA Plus.\n\n14\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.760\nAnd in this episode we're gonna start\ntaking a look at some of the different\n\n15\n00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.400\ntools that we need to be familiar with.\n\n16\n00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.950\nThere's a laundry list.\n\n17\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.620\nWhen you look at the objectives for this\nexam, there's, I don't know, guessing, 20,\n\n18\n00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.170\n30 different tools that they list out.\n\n19\n00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.200\nIt might not be quite that many.\n\n20\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.470\nI like to exaggerate.\n\n21\n00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.280\nBut there is.\n\n22\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.900\nThere's a whole slew.\n\n23\n00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.060\nThe very last objective\nis a whole slew of tools.\n\n24\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.820\nAnd in the end, what they need.\n\n25\n00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.680\nIf I can say this.\n\n26\n00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.452\nLet's slow down just a little bit.\n\n27\n00:01:00.452 --> 00:01:06.400\nWhat CompTIA want you to be able to do\nis recognize the appropriate tool for\n\n28\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.690\nthe situation.\n\n29\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.190\nAnd if you're using, and if you need\nto scan a network would you use Nmap or\n\n30\n00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.600\nwould you use AlienVault.\n\n31\n00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.890\nOr if you need to do\nvulnerability assessment,\n\n32\n00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.540\nwhat tools are available for you?\n\n33\n00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.083\nAnd that's really, cuz remember,\nthis is vendor-neutral, right?\n\n34\n00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:26.410\nCompTIA strives for that.\n\n35\n00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.200\nSo there's not really any one,\n\n36\n00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.410\ntwo in particular that you\nneed to to know inside-out.\n\n37\n00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.770\nThat being said, you need to be\nfamiliar with the names of these tools.\n\n38\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.990\nYou also need to be familiar with\nwhat their capabilities are.\n\n39\n00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.760\nAnd most of these if you take one\nof them and play around with for\n\n40\n00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.550\na little bit, you'll get a basic idea\n\n41\n00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.570\nof what most of the tools in\nthat category would do, right?\n\n42\n00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.800\nMost scanners work the same where you\nneed to install the scanner program.\n\n43\n00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.000\nYou’ve got your target or a way to\nspecify what it is you wanna scan.\n\n44\n00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.710\nA single machine or\na network or a range of ports.\n\n45\n00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.530\nAnd you click scan and they'll go scan and\nthey'll return the information.\n\n46\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.950\nSo most of them work the same.\n\n47\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.680\nSome of them are more capable than others.\n\n48\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.580\nSome of them are free, some of them pay,\nsome of them have trials available.\n\n49\n00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.010\nBut in the end they're the basic\nfunctionality is the same.\n\n50\n00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.450\nSo what I would suggest to you, and what\nI'm gonna try to do here is gonna pick\n\n51\n00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.720\none out of the different categories and\njust look at it.\n\n52\n00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.060\nAnd understand what the purpose\nof this kind of tool is.\n\n53\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.920\nWhat kind of information I can\nget back from a tool like this.\n\n54\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.520\nThat's the thing.\n\n55\n00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.390\nSo when I use Snort for example in this\nepisode, I'm not saying that Snort is\n\n56\n00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.520\nthe only one or the best one or\nthe one you have to know for the exam.\n\n57\n00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.240\nIt's just one of many.\n\n58\n00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.160\nIt happens to be free,\nwhich is always a big plus for me.\n\n59\n00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.370\nAgain, a lot of these\nprograms are commercial.\n\n60\n00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.500\nLicensing is not cheap on them.\n\n61\n00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.780\nA lot of them do have trials, but\nyou have to register for them.\n\n62\n00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.900\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n63\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.450\nRegister for the trials.\n\n64\n00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.330\nDownload and install it.\n\n65\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.320\nBut then it time bombs on you, so\n\n66\n00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.630\nwhen you're doing work like we\ndo here that can be frustrating.\n\n67\n00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.850\nBecause when it's time for\n\n68\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.630\nthe next show, that trial expired\nI gotta go register again.\n\n69\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.600\nSo I do try to stick with\nsome of the free ones.\n\n70\n00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.230\n&gt;&gt; What's interesting about,\nwe're talking snort here being\n\n71\n00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.525\nfree which at CS we love that, the whole\nprice of $3.99 does appeal to me.\n\n72\n00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:16.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But Ronnie says,\n\n73\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.420\naccording to Ronnie that is,\nthis is here say.\n\n74\n00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.970\nBut that the Cisco FirePOWER\nis based off of Snort.\n\n75\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:22.690\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n76\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.625\n&gt;&gt; So that's not free.\n\n77\n00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:24.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not.\n\n78\n00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.670\nAnd you'll find that with a lot of the\ndifferent commercial products like Cisco.\n\n79\n00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.270\nThey're like why reinvent the wheel if\nwe can get the engine from snort and\n\n80\n00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.870\nuse that inside our product.\n\n81\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.520\nThe same thing goes with the product like\nAlien Volt which is one of those same\n\n82\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.240\nsystems where if you look under\nthe hood it's actually OSSIM\n\n83\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.730\nthat's doing the majority of the,\nor a lot of the,\n\n84\n00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.550\nwell, I should say a portion of it cuz\nAlien Vault does many, many things.\n\n85\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.490\nIt's a great program, massive program.\n\n86\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.060\nOne of the things it does is\nsome vulnerability scanning and\n\n87\n00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.230\nit collects logs.\n\n88\n00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.200\nAnd OSSIM is one of the engines it uses.\n\n89\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.740\nBut OSSIM is free.\n\n90\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.330\nYou can go out and get that and\nrun that on your own.\n\n91\n00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.055\nSends the pretty interface and\n\n92\n00:04:07.055 --> 00:04:10.900\nall of those other capabilities\nthat you get with Alien Volt.\n\n93\n00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.530\nSo when you look at those big price tags,\n\n94\n00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.870\non all that commercial software,\nthere's a reason they cost that much.\n\n95\n00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.730\nBecause they've taken one\nof these freely available\n\n96\n00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.020\nengines and they've added Much to it.\n\n97\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.570\nThey've made it much more easy to,\n\n98\n00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.650\nmaybe not easy but\nthey've made it much more powerful.\n\n99\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.110\nThey've given us great graphics and\n\n100\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.370\nreporting capabilities and\nall kinds of other things.\n\n101\n00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.790\nAnd if that's what you need then it's\nworth the money that you're gonna pay for\n\n102\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.950\nthose types of products.\n\n103\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.380\nAnd support is typically included\nin products like that as well.\n\n104\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.120\nAnd that can be a big thing in\nan enterprise environment, I need,\n\n105\n00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.810\nI might need that level of support.\n\n106\n00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.640\nIf something goes wrong, or if I need to\nwork this program a little bit better or\n\n107\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.610\nmake it do something that\nit's not doing currently.\n\n108\n00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.680\nIt's nice to be able to pick up\nthe phone and call somebody, and\n\n109\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.240\nsay, hey, experts,\nwhat the heck am I doing wrong here?\n\n110\n00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.140\nWhereas with free stuff you end up going\nto blogs and forums and then you have to\n\n111\n00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.670\npick and choose which advice do I listen\nto, you know, that kind of thing.\n\n112\n00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.240\nAll right so\nanyway let's take a look at Snort again.\n\n113\n00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.380\nSnort is a IDS slash IPS,\nit can actually be many things.\n\n114\n00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.360\nYou can configure it to\nbe a packet capture.\n\n115\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.780\nYou can also configure it to be an IDS,\nan intrusion detection system.\n\n116\n00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.830\nYou can configure it to be an IPS,\nan intrusion prevention system.\n\n117\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.670\nRemember there's a difference there,\nIDS is detect potential intrusions.\n\n118\n00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.270\nAnd they'll log it and\nyou can go and check on that, but\n\n119\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.670\nthey don't do anything about it, right.\n\n120\n00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.670\nThey're just letting you know that, hey I\nsaw this, you might wanna check it out.\n\n121\n00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.610\nWhere as an IPS intrusion\nprevention system is active, right,\n\n122\n00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.650\nrather than being passive.\n\n123\n00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.510\nWhere it can detect something and\n\n124\n00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.510\nthen have steps to take to try to prevent,\nthat from doing anymore damage.\n\n125\n00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.050\nUnusual activities coming out\nof a particular computer my\n\n126\n00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.210\nIDS will just log that whereas my\nIPS might be able to reach out,\n\n127\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.080\ntalk to the switch and\nshut that port down, right?\n\n128\n00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.990\nTo prevent that from going any further.\n\n129\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.560\nBut Snort can do all of that.\n\n130\n00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.300\nOf course we have to be able\nto configure it to do those.\n\n131\n00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.130\nSo what we're gonna do here is\nwe're just gonna start out.\n\n132\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.000\nLet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n133\n00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.940\nI've got Snort installed\non my Kali Linux box.\n\n134\n00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.139\nAnd I just want to type in Snort.\n\n135\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.000\nAnd let's do a dash capital V, all right?\n\n136\n00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.250\nThis is just to verify that\nI've got Snort installed.\n\n137\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.800\nI can see a little bit of information\nabout my installation of Snort.\n\n138\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.340\nAnd of course the really cool ASCI\npig over there is my favorite.\n\n139\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.550\nBut it's telling me\nwhat lippy cat version.\n\n140\n00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.810\nI'm using preprocessors and\nthings like that.\n\n141\n00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.180\nSo if you need to verify or\n\n142\n00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.330\ncheck and see if you've got the latest\nversion you can do that there.\n\n143\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.010\nSo we're running Snort.\n\n144\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.160\nLet's take a look at the help\nfile that comes with Snort.\n\n145\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.840\nWe'll do a little --help.\n\n146\n00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.490\nAnd it's pretty large.\n\n147\n00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.270\nThere is a lot of things\nthat I can do with Snort.\n\n148\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.910\nAll right.\nAnd we're definitely not gonna go\n\n149\n00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.590\nthrough all of these.\n\n150\n00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.820\nAgain, we're not trying to learn\nany one particular program or\n\n151\n00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.890\nabout what these kind of things can do.\n\n152\n00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.660\nThere are a few if you're\ngonna play around with Snort,\n\n153\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.600\na few that you're going to need to\nset that'll be very helpful anyway.\n\n154\n00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.300\nOne of them is this dash lowercase C.\n\n155\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.720\nThis tells it where your\nconfiguration file is,\n\n156\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.340\nwhich then in turn points\nit towards your rule sets.\n\n157\n00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.880\nSo that will be important as something\nyou do when you start up Snort.\n\n158\n00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.610\nYou tell it what config to read and use.\n\n159\n00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.640\nAnother one that we might wanna\npay attention to is this -i,\n\n160\n00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.540\ntell it what interface it's\ngoing to be listening on.\n\n161\n00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:49.440\nSometimes I'll end up using the -l to log,\nto specify a particular log location.\n\n162\n00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.704\nAnd those are just again a few of them.\n\n163\n00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:56.110\nAs you can see there are several,\nbut snort//help and\n\n164\n00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:01.454\nyou will get all of this information and\nSnort has great information\n\n165\n00:08:01.454 --> 00:08:06.635\nout on their website,\nsnort.org If you need more information.\n\n166\n00:08:06.635 --> 00:08:11.201\nAll right, so what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna start by making a configuration\n\n167\n00:08:11.201 --> 00:08:15.437\nfile because I wanna show you a very\nbasic Snort first and then we'll look and\n\n168\n00:08:15.437 --> 00:08:17.909\nsee what you can\npotentially do with Snort.\n\n169\n00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:21.635\nSo what I’m gonna do is I’m going\nto open up local text editor and\n\n170\n00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:26.126\nwe're gonna create a new file,\nwe're gonna call this snort-test.conf.\n\n171\n00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.323\nAnd we're gonna write out\na simple configuration file.\n\n172\n00:08:31.323 --> 00:08:34.808\nRemember the configuration is what\nSnort reads when it starts up,\n\n173\n00:08:34.808 --> 00:08:37.684\ntells it where its rule sets\nare amongst other things.\n\n174\n00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:43.329\nAnd we're gonna do include and\nI wanna include,\n\n175\n00:08:43.329 --> 00:08:47.323\nlet's just do /etc/snort/ and\n\n176\n00:08:47.323 --> 00:08:53.258\nwe're gonna say icnp-test.rules,\nall right?\n\n177\n00:08:53.258 --> 00:09:00.565\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nsave that, And write that out.\n\n178\n00:09:00.565 --> 00:09:05.083\nSo if we take a look,\nI now have my snort-test.\n\n179\n00:09:05.083 --> 00:09:10.844\nAnd again just to verify that all that\nwork, we can do a snort-test.com and we\n\n180\n00:09:10.844 --> 00:09:16.540\ncan see the only thing it has is one line\nin there so as include icmp test rules.\n\n181\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.542\nWell, there is no file yet,\nicmp-test.rules.\n\n182\n00:09:20.542 --> 00:09:21.792\nWe need to make that one next.\n\n183\n00:09:21.792 --> 00:09:24.138\n&gt;&gt; So this isn't something\nthat's in there by default.\n\n184\n00:09:24.138 --> 00:09:26.003\nWe're gonna create these set of rules.\n\n185\n00:09:26.003 --> 00:09:30.026\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right,\nwe're gonna learn how to write a very,\n\n186\n00:09:30.026 --> 00:09:34.319\nvery simple rule cuz as we'll\nsee they get rather complex.\n\n187\n00:09:34.319 --> 00:09:38.242\nI remember I was taking,\nthis was gosh, half a decade ago,\n\n188\n00:09:38.242 --> 00:09:39.902\nI was doing EC councils.\n\n189\n00:09:39.902 --> 00:09:43.194\nSome EC council training, and I remember\nin the same buildings that people\n\n190\n00:09:43.194 --> 00:09:46.800\nwere doing other training, gentleman\nwalks out with a three-ring binder that,\n\n191\n00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.647\nI kid you not, is about six inches thick.\n\n192\n00:09:48.647 --> 00:09:51.228\nI said wow, what class are you taking,\nhe was like, Snort.\n\n193\n00:09:51.228 --> 00:09:54.582\nI'm like wow, yeah,\nlearning how to write rules.\n\n194\n00:09:54.582 --> 00:09:58.143\nAll right, so let's do this,\nlet's do the same thing basically.\n\n195\n00:09:58.143 --> 00:10:02.998\nWe're gonna fire up nano and\nwe're gonna write that file, icmp-test,\n\n196\n00:10:02.998 --> 00:10:05.438\nbetter spell that right, .rules.\n\n197\n00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:09.167\nAnd we're gonna write our first rule, and\n\n198\n00:10:09.167 --> 00:10:12.042\nwe'll look at the format of\nwhat a general rule looks like.\n\n199\n00:10:12.042 --> 00:10:15.128\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna type, well not that.\n\n200\n00:10:15.128 --> 00:10:16.454\nLet's type alert.\n\n201\n00:10:16.454 --> 00:10:19.015\nIt's basically giving it a category,\n\n202\n00:10:19.015 --> 00:10:22.284\ntelling it where to log\nthis particular event to.\n\n203\n00:10:22.284 --> 00:10:26.177\nAnd I wanna do icmp as the protocol.\n\n204\n00:10:26.177 --> 00:10:31.642\nAnd then I've got source,\nip address, and source, port number.\n\n205\n00:10:31.642 --> 00:10:34.050\nAnd you can see I'm\njust gonna put any any.\n\n206\n00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:40.671\nAnd then I'm going to do my little fancy\narrow, a little dash greater than symbol.\n\n207\n00:10:40.671 --> 00:10:44.743\nAnd again I'm gonna do any any,\nthis would be destination IP address and\n\n208\n00:10:44.743 --> 00:10:46.298\ndestination port number.\n\n209\n00:10:46.298 --> 00:10:48.252\nSo I'm basically leaving it wide open,\nright?\n\n210\n00:10:48.252 --> 00:10:50.179\nAny any any any.\n\n211\n00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:56.427\nSo from any IP address, any port number\nto any IP address, any port number.\n\n212\n00:10:56.427 --> 00:10:59.636\nAnd then what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna open up the parentheses and\n\n213\n00:10:59.636 --> 00:11:00.795\ntype in message colon.\n\n214\n00:11:00.795 --> 00:11:03.232\nAnd then inside quotes\nI'm gonna put my message.\n\n215\n00:11:03.232 --> 00:11:07.842\nAnd for\nthis one I'm just gonna put ICMP Packet.\n\n216\n00:11:07.842 --> 00:11:12.981\nI will end my quote, and\ndon't forget your semicolon there, Mike.\n\n217\n00:11:12.981 --> 00:11:15.702\nAnd then sid colon.\n\n218\n00:11:15.702 --> 00:11:17.939\nSID is the Snort ID.\n\n219\n00:11:17.939 --> 00:11:20.593\nAnd you can call it\nwhatever the heck you want.\n\n220\n00:11:20.593 --> 00:11:22.845\nYou make up your own number except for\none little rule.\n\n221\n00:11:22.845 --> 00:11:28.388\nIt has to be greater than 1 billion,\nright, or 1 million.\n\n222\n00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:33.939\nSo we wanna do is, oops, and\nlet's check my num lock there, uh-oh.\n\n223\n00:11:35.935 --> 00:11:38.020\nLet's get out of that, sorry.\n\n224\n00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.950\nNum Lock was not turned on, evidently.\n\n225\n00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.122\nTry that one more time, there we go.\n\n226\n00:11:43.122 --> 00:11:44.452\nSo what I'm gonna do, one, two, three.\n\n227\n00:11:44.452 --> 00:11:46.978\nI have to count these, one, two, one.\n\n228\n00:11:46.978 --> 00:11:48.001\nAll right, so what is that?\n\n229\n00:11:48.001 --> 00:11:50.372\nYeah, 1 million and 1, so 1 million.\n\n230\n00:11:50.372 --> 00:11:54.723\nAnyway, from 1 million down reserved for\nSnort, 1 million.\n\n231\n00:11:54.723 --> 00:11:57.987\nAnything greater than 1 million,\nyou can use for your own IDs.\n\n232\n00:11:57.987 --> 00:12:01.346\nAnd this will help you later on,\nyou don't really try to get,\n\n233\n00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:04.831\nI mean you should give it a Snort ID and\nthis will help me later on,\n\n234\n00:12:04.831 --> 00:12:07.565\nlike if I wanna go back in and\nfilter logs, right?\n\n235\n00:12:07.565 --> 00:12:12.333\nAnd look for a particular event.I can use\nthis Snort ID to go through those Snort\n\n236\n00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:16.762\nlogs looking for all events that are,\nin this case, my ICMP event types.\n\n237\n00:12:16.762 --> 00:12:19.892\nSo anything over a million is fine.\n\n238\n00:12:19.892 --> 00:12:25.295\nThen we're gonna do our revision,\nrev: 1 and I'll go ahead and\n\n239\n00:12:25.295 --> 00:12:31.601\ndo my semi-colon, and in parenthesis,\nand again that's really for you.\n\n240\n00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:34.712\nRev : 1 will help me when I'm editing or\nmodifying rules,\n\n241\n00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:37.404\nknowing what version of\na particular rule I'm on.\n\n242\n00:12:37.404 --> 00:12:42.843\nSo as I make changes to that rule, I would\nprobably increase that revision number.\n\n243\n00:12:42.843 --> 00:12:44.078\nAll right, and that’s it.\n\n244\n00:12:44.078 --> 00:12:48.128\nSo very, very simple rule\nthat we're going to use and\n\n245\n00:12:48.128 --> 00:12:54.364\nthen I’m going to save this guy,\nAnd write that out.\n\n246\n00:12:54.364 --> 00:12:59.379\nSo now, if I take a look,\nwe've got our snort-test.conf,\n\n247\n00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:04.202\nand we also have our icnp-test.rules\nthat the conf file is\n\n248\n00:13:04.202 --> 00:13:07.200\ngoing to be pointing to, all right?\n\n249\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.263\nAll right, so now that we got those ready,\nnow it's time to fire up Snort.\n\n250\n00:13:11.263 --> 00:13:17.633\nSo we're gonna type in Snort, and\nthen -i for interface and you know what?\n\n251\n00:13:17.633 --> 00:13:21.177\nI better double check my interface, I was\nswitching those around before we started.\n\n252\n00:13:23.813 --> 00:13:25.985\nAnd I need eth1.\n\n253\n00:13:25.985 --> 00:13:29.335\nAll right, so let me clear that screen,\n\n254\n00:13:31.313 --> 00:13:36.488\nSnort -i eth1, and\nthen we're going to do -c,\n\n255\n00:13:36.488 --> 00:13:42.911\nand this is where we gonna point\nit to the configuration file.\n\n256\n00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:45.461\nIt's in the same directory\nthat I'm currently located but\n\n257\n00:13:45.461 --> 00:13:46.687\nlet's write it out anyway.\n\n258\n00:13:46.687 --> 00:13:48.881\nWe'll do etc Snort.\n\n259\n00:13:51.277 --> 00:13:57.426\nAnd then snort-test.comf.\n\n260\n00:13:57.426 --> 00:14:01.199\nSo I am telling it where that\nconfiguration file is, and\n\n261\n00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:04.907\nI then am gonna do a -l and\nI'm gonna log this to var/,\n\n262\n00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.415\nThere's log/snort, and\n\n263\n00:14:10.415 --> 00:14:15.898\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit Enter right?\n\n264\n00:14:15.898 --> 00:14:19.506\nAnd so what we're gonna see, now we're\ngonna see a lot of things scrolling\n\n265\n00:14:19.506 --> 00:14:23.514\nby here, well I shouldn't say a lot,\nthere's really one thing that's gonna keep\n\n266\n00:14:23.514 --> 00:14:26.689\nscrolling by, no preprocessors configured,\nif I can say that.\n\n267\n00:14:26.689 --> 00:14:30.050\nAnd that's because, you guessed it,\nin my configuration file,\n\n268\n00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.219\nit didn't configure any preprocessors.\n\n269\n00:14:32.219 --> 00:14:37.605\nPreprocessors help me filter down the data\nlike we'll have a preprocessor for\n\n270\n00:14:37.605 --> 00:14:41.451\nSMTP that only captures\ncertain types of SMTP traffic.\n\n271\n00:14:41.451 --> 00:14:46.443\nThey allow me to make Snort\nwork a little more efficiently.\n\n272\n00:14:46.443 --> 00:14:50.863\nI don't have any configured for\npolicy zero, but that's okay.\n\n273\n00:14:50.863 --> 00:14:53.502\nIn fact, you know what,\nlet's kill it for just a second.\n\n274\n00:14:53.502 --> 00:14:56.481\nI'm gonna do a Ctrl+C to stop it so\nI can scroll back up and\n\n275\n00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:59.848\nshow you what happened when we\nloaded that configuration file.\n\n276\n00:14:59.848 --> 00:15:01.981\nSo there's Snort exited.\n\n277\n00:15:01.981 --> 00:15:06.183\nI'm gonna scroll back up to\nwhere I ran that command.\n\n278\n00:15:06.183 --> 00:15:10.483\nAnd I can see that it's running\nin IDS mode, all right?\n\n279\n00:15:10.483 --> 00:15:15.033\nAnd it's initializing my preprocessors and\nplug-ins which I have none, telling\n\n280\n00:15:15.033 --> 00:15:19.720\nme there's my log directory, there's\nthe configuration file it's pulling from.\n\n281\n00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.115\nSo I'm verifying hey, this is correct,\nthis is where I pointed it to,\n\n282\n00:15:23.115 --> 00:15:24.825\nit did find the appropriate files.\n\n283\n00:15:24.825 --> 00:15:30.882\nI can see here that there was only one\nrule and it was a detection type rule.\n\n284\n00:15:30.882 --> 00:15:37.731\nDown below there, I can see that\nthere is one rule ICMP with any.\n\n285\n00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:41.631\nIt's not a source rule,\na destination rule, it's an any rule and\n\n286\n00:15:41.631 --> 00:15:42.896\nthere is one of them.\n\n287\n00:15:42.896 --> 00:15:46.428\nAnd then some information about my system.\n\n288\n00:15:46.428 --> 00:15:51.113\nAnd then it fires up and\nbegins the process, and then, of course,\n\n289\n00:15:51.113 --> 00:15:56.569\nwhen I killed it, it gives me a summary\nof what it captured, or found as we go.\n\n290\n00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:57.995\nSo, let's do that again.\n\n291\n00:15:57.995 --> 00:16:02.615\nNow that we've seen that, let's run\nthat one more time All right, and\n\n292\n00:16:02.615 --> 00:16:03.934\nwe'll let that go.\n\n293\n00:16:03.934 --> 00:16:06.220\nSo now what I wanna do is just\ntry to trigger something, right?\n\n294\n00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.680\nMake it capture some information.\n\n295\n00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.940\nSo let's go over to my Windows box here.\n\n296\n00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:20.431\nAnd I wanna ping 10.0., whoops,\ncheck that Num Lock, Mike, 10.0.100.\n\n297\n00:16:20.431 --> 00:16:24.262\nLet's do 13 and we'll ping it a few times.\n\n298\n00:16:24.262 --> 00:16:30.100\nAnd then we'll switch back over to Kali.\n\n299\n00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.590\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nkill Snort with a little Ctrl+C action.\n\n300\n00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.750\nAll right now we're gonna take a look and\nsee if it indeed worked.\n\n301\n00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.133\nSo I'm gonna take a look at the log\nfile that we told it to do.\n\n302\n00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:45.118\nWe will do var/log/snort/alert.\n\n303\n00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:52.022\nAnd sure enough, right there are my logs,\n\n304\n00:16:52.022 --> 00:16:57.050\nyou can see my message that I put,\nICMP Packet.\n\n305\n00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:02.670\nYou can see the Snort ID that I\nassigned to it, that 1000001.\n\n306\n00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:06.032\nAnd I can see where it's coming from,\nright?\n\n307\n00:17:06.032 --> 00:17:09.780\nAnd that's my Windows machine\nheading over to that one.\n\n308\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.492\nAnd you can also see the replies\ncoming back from Kali, right,\n\n309\n00:17:13.492 --> 00:17:16.448\ngoing back over to the Windows\nbox that pinged it.\n\n310\n00:17:16.448 --> 00:17:17.399\nThere I can see my ECHO.\n\n311\n00:17:17.399 --> 00:17:21.055\nAnd there is my ECHO REPLY.\n\n312\n00:17:21.055 --> 00:17:24.775\nSo it is indeed capturing those\npackets just like we told it to.\n\n313\n00:17:24.775 --> 00:17:29.475\nSo, we make that rule and we specify\nwhat it is we want Snort to look for.\n\n314\n00:17:29.475 --> 00:17:32.406\nIt's monitoring all the traffic\nthat's going on, but\n\n315\n00:17:32.406 --> 00:17:35.598\nit's only capturing information\nthat I told it to capture.\n\n316\n00:17:35.598 --> 00:17:39.420\n&gt;&gt; And then from there you could easily\njust write yourself a script that looks\n\n317\n00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.459\ninto this log file.\n\n318\n00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:43.488\nChecks for these types of alerts,\n\n319\n00:17:43.488 --> 00:17:48.620\nspecific ones that you want to\nbe alerted of more overtly.\n\n320\n00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.656\nDoing it out in the open.\n\n321\n00:17:50.656 --> 00:17:54.370\nSay, I want you to know this is happening,\nand just say email me when you see this\n\n322\n00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.320\ntype Put that in the body of\nthe message and then slam it out.\n\n323\n00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.820\nThat's an easy kind of\nthing to do in Linux.\n\n324\n00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.126\nYou could really even do\nit in Windows as well.\n\n325\n00:18:00.126 --> 00:18:02.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\nabsolutely, all right,\n\n326\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.440\nnow let's take a look at,\nwhat do I wanna do next?\n\n327\n00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.959\nSo we've seen writing up\nsnort configuration file,\n\n328\n00:18:08.959 --> 00:18:11.156\nwe saw the rules that we created.\n\n329\n00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:13.560\nI also wanna show you something.\n\n330\n00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.330\nLet's take a look at Wireshark.\n\n331\n00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.830\nWireshark, what the heck?\n\n332\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.800\nWell, when Snort captures\nthis information,\n\n333\n00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.160\nit actually has several different\nways it can store the information.\n\n334\n00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.850\nYou can do TCP dumps.\n\n335\n00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:32.170\nWe can end up sending this out into\na database for further analysis for\n\n336\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:36.360\nstorage, for collecting up that big\ndata and doing analytics on it.\n\n337\n00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.992\nWe can use Wireshark to\nopen this up as well.\n\n338\n00:18:38.992 --> 00:18:41.893\nI'm gonna do a File &gt; Open, and\n\n339\n00:18:41.893 --> 00:18:47.980\nI'm gonna navigate over to that\nsame directory and find one.\n\n340\n00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:48.573\nThere is 37 to 214.\n\n341\n00:18:48.573 --> 00:18:49.950\nThat's the one we just generated.\n\n342\n00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.250\nI'll go ahead and hit Open.\n\n343\n00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.380\nAnd there you see the same information.\n\n344\n00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.570\nI know that's probably\na little small on you guys.\n\n345\n00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:06.401\nI didn't bump my font up in Wireshark.\n\n346\n00:19:06.401 --> 00:19:09.925\nIt's just reading that Snort\nlog that it dumped out and\n\n347\n00:19:09.925 --> 00:19:11.850\nI can take this information.\n\n348\n00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:17.158\nAnd I can expand it out and I can get\ninformation, there's my echo request.\n\n349\n00:19:17.158 --> 00:19:19.557\nLet's drag this down-\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense that you can do this too\n\n350\n00:19:19.557 --> 00:19:23.400\nbecause if I'm remembering correctly,\nSnort is based off of TCP DUMP.\n\n351\n00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; They used that as the foundation.\n\n352\n00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:29.760\n&gt;&gt; I believe you are correct.\n\n353\n00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.450\nAll the information that you would\nexpect to be there is there.\n\n354\n00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.000\nI can click on the different packets.\n\n355\n00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.030\nI can expand out the information.\n\n356\n00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:40.110\nWe can use our normal display\nfilters within Wireshark\n\n357\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.378\nnow to analyze basically that\ndump that Snort did for us.\n\n358\n00:19:44.378 --> 00:19:49.572\nSo great to know that I can kinda cross\nover platforms there if I want to be able,\n\n359\n00:19:49.572 --> 00:19:54.471\nI might have some really good filters\nthat I've written up in Wireshark.\n\n360\n00:19:54.471 --> 00:19:56.605\nThat show me exactly what I need to.\n\n361\n00:19:56.605 --> 00:20:00.990\nSorry, I'm getting some pop\nups down there, silly mail.\n\n362\n00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.599\nWireshark, I've used it a lot and\n\n363\n00:20:02.599 --> 00:20:05.775\nI've got my filters preconfigured\nthat I need to analyze traffic.\n\n364\n00:20:05.775 --> 00:20:08.483\nSo I can grab that Snort log,\ndump it in here and\n\n365\n00:20:08.483 --> 00:20:10.641\nnot have to recreate all my filters.\n\n366\n00:20:10.641 --> 00:20:14.229\nOr go through the log file and\ntry to figure out what I've got there.\n\n367\n00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.596\nAll right, so that's basic Snort.\n\n368\n00:20:16.596 --> 00:20:22.224\nNow, the last thing I wanna show you with\nSnort is that we kept it really simple,\n\n369\n00:20:22.224 --> 00:20:24.328\nbut what I wanna show you now.\n\n370\n00:20:24.328 --> 00:20:27.902\nLet's do a little nano snort.conf.\n\n371\n00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:36.247\nAll right,\nthis is the default snort.conf file.\n\n372\n00:20:36.247 --> 00:20:39.508\nThis one comes when you install Snort.\n\n373\n00:20:39.508 --> 00:20:41.819\nYou'll see it's 735 lines,\n\n374\n00:20:41.819 --> 00:20:47.438\nits a little bit longer than the little\nconfiguration file that we've created.\n\n375\n00:20:47.438 --> 00:20:51.540\nAnd a lot of this,\nit just says here, go through this.\n\n376\n00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.004\nThey've got commented\nit up extremely well.\n\n377\n00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:54.812\nThere are different sections.\n\n378\n00:20:54.812 --> 00:20:56.477\nIf you look at my screen right here,\n\n379\n00:20:56.477 --> 00:20:59.320\nyou can see this file contains\nsample Snort configuration.\n\n380\n00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.530\nYou should take the following steps to\ncreate your own custom configuration.\n\n381\n00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.380\nAnd it tells you,\nset the network variable,\n\n382\n00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.700\nconfigure your decoder,\nconfigure your base detection engine.\n\n383\n00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.977\nAnd it runs you through steps.\n\n384\n00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:12.798\nAnd then the different sections\nare actually set right here.\n\n385\n00:21:12.798 --> 00:21:15.210\nHere is step 1.\n\n386\n00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.040\nSet my network variables.\n\n387\n00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.570\nSo as I go down through this area\nyou'll see all the different comments.\n\n388\n00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:25.800\nYou can simply comment or uncomment or\nmodify this file as necessary.\n\n389\n00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:31.060\nOne of the things we can do that you\nreally should do is set up your home net.\n\n390\n00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.710\nNow I could have done this in\nmy simple configuration file.\n\n391\n00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:38.330\nFirst line in there could have\njust been ipvar home_net and\n\n392\n00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.820\nthen my network address.\n\n393\n00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.120\nAnd that would have allowed\nme to use in my rule\n\n394\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:49.880\nany from source could have been any any,\nbut destination would be homevar any.\n\n395\n00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.180\nSo only IP addresses on this subnet,\nany port number, all right?\n\n396\n00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.542\nSo you can start using those\nvariables in your rules.\n\n397\n00:21:56.542 --> 00:22:00.858\nBecause if you've got thousands of rules,\nand something changes on your network,\n\n398\n00:22:00.858 --> 00:22:02.513\nyour network address changes.\n\n399\n00:22:02.513 --> 00:22:05.584\nYou don't wanna go through every\nsingle one of those rules and\n\n400\n00:22:05.584 --> 00:22:08.140\nstart updating network addresses, right?\n\n401\n00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.970\nThat's why we use variables.\n\n402\n00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.794\nSo using that allows you to specify.\n\n403\n00:22:11.794 --> 00:22:16.780\nHome net is the network you're\ntrying to protect typically.\n\n404\n00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:20.460\nSo it doesn't necessarily have to\nbe a home based network right?\n\n405\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.840\nThat's your home net,\nthe one you wanna protect.\n\n406\n00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.890\nThen you've got external\nnet that you can use.\n\n407\n00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.810\nAnd you can see by default it's\nactually commented out, right?\n\n408\n00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:34.640\nBut if you were to uncomment that\nthe default is that external net\n\n409\n00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.270\nis anything that's not home net.\n\n410\n00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.920\nRight, and you can set these\nvariables to whatever you need to for\n\n411\n00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.940\nyour particular environment.\n\n412\n00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.630\nSo the first thing you would do\nwhen you're setting up Snort\n\n413\n00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:49.282\nis at least set your home net so\nthat you can start using that.\n\n414\n00:22:49.282 --> 00:22:52.486\nOther things we wanna\nlook at are the output.\n\n415\n00:22:52.486 --> 00:22:55.959\nSo let's jump down, this is section five.\n\n416\n00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:59.350\nSo let me get way down here, five or\nsix if I remember correctly.\n\n417\n00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.090\nWe'll get to down there,\nit was five, wasn't it?\n\n418\n00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:06.130\nNo, output was six.\n\n419\n00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:11.250\nYou can see down at the bottom,\nConfigure output plugins, all right.\n\n420\n00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.541\nAnd when you look at this,\n\n421\n00:23:12.541 --> 00:23:15.314\nthere are a couple of lines\nyou're gonna wanna look at.\n\n422\n00:23:15.314 --> 00:23:17.430\nThis one right here I've uncommented.\n\n423\n00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:22.283\nAnd I'm allowing to do its\nunified2 which is where you can\n\n424\n00:23:22.283 --> 00:23:26.650\nspit out this dump with in\na pretty standard format.\n\n425\n00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.440\nYou can see it's gonna go to snort.log.\n\n426\n00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.810\nThe other one that I've actually\ncommented out was this one down here.\n\n427\n00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.713\nIf you wanted to use this with\nan application that read TCP dump\n\n428\n00:23:39.713 --> 00:23:41.706\nfiles you could do that.\n\n429\n00:23:41.706 --> 00:23:45.970\nSo that's how you would configure\nthe output for your appropriate scenario.\n\n430\n00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.530\nAnd then one more thing I wanna\nshow you down here at the bottom.\n\n431\n00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.069\nCustomize your rule set.\n\n432\n00:23:51.069 --> 00:23:55.252\nSo as you saw in my sample conf\nI basically said, include and\n\n433\n00:23:55.252 --> 00:24:00.191\nthen gave it the path to that 1.rules\nfile That we created that then in\n\n434\n00:24:00.191 --> 00:24:01.879\nturn had one rule in it.\n\n435\n00:24:01.879 --> 00:24:04.970\nWell we look at the default\nconfiguration for snort.\n\n436\n00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:10.410\nWe come down here to step seven and\nwe'll see there's one include\n\n437\n00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:15.010\nrule path local var or local.rule, sorry.\n\n438\n00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.970\nNow rule path is a variable,\nwe could set above.\n\n439\n00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:21.560\nThere's a folder called rules\nby default inside the snort and\n\n440\n00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.020\nthere's a local.rules file in there and\nit's blank by default.\n\n441\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.200\nAnd so that's where I can go and\nput rules that I'm creating.\n\n442\n00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.550\nInstead of making my own file,\nI can just use this one.\n\n443\n00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.000\nOr you can create your own and\njust use an include statement.\n\n444\n00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.434\nBut then down below that are a bunch\nof these pre-built rules and\n\n445\n00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:41.960\nyou'll see that where it starts include,\nthey're right here.\n\n446\n00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.790\nAnd get down to that line.\n\n447\n00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.190\nSo there is the beginning of the includes.\n\n448\n00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:50.340\nThe ones with the pound symbols are\ncommented out so it's not gonna use those.\n\n449\n00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:56.320\nBut you can see by default,\nI have things like this one right here.\n\n450\n00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.270\nInclude attack response rules.\n\n451\n00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.490\nRight below that we've\ngot back door rules.\n\n452\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.728\nBelow that I have my bad traffic rules.\n\n453\n00:25:04.728 --> 00:25:08.650\nThose are un-commented, that means\nthose rule sets are going to be in play\n\n454\n00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.300\nif I use this default configuration for\nSnort.\n\n455\n00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.190\nBut you'll see there's a lot\nthat are commented out.\n\n456\n00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:17.340\nAnd if these are rules that I want,\nthese are basically community rules,\n\n457\n00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.720\nthese are rules that are developed\nby the store community.\n\n458\n00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.520\nYou can go out and download updates\nto these rules and you should.\n\n459\n00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.850\nJust like any application,\nlike our antivirus software, for\n\n460\n00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:31.620\nexample, you need to keep these up to date\nas they add new rules that could detect\n\n461\n00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.770\nnew types of attacks.\n\n462\n00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.480\nOf course, you can write your own.\n\n463\n00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.360\nBut there are people that spend\na lot of time writing these rules.\n\n464\n00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.840\nAnd these rules can get rather complex.\n\n465\n00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.650\nWe'll take a look at one.\n\n466\n00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.980\nSo I'm just gonna page down through here.\n\n467\n00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:50.020\nAnd you can see there are quite a few\nrule sets that we can do there.\n\n468\n00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.620\nAll right, I'm gonna exit out of that and\nnot actually make any changes to it.\n\n469\n00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.130\nAnd let's take a look in this directory.\n\n470\n00:25:56.130 --> 00:26:00.450\nYou'll see rules, so\nI'm going to change over to rules there.\n\n471\n00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:04.380\nAnd in rules there's all\nthose different rules that\n\n472\n00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.820\nsome are commented out, some are not.\n\n473\n00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:11.990\nAnd let's just grab one,\nlet's take a look at, let's do icmp-rules,\n\n474\n00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:19.030\nthere's actually a couple cool rules\nin here, icmp-info-rule is one.\n\n475\n00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.660\nAll right, and you can see their\nrules are a little more complex,\n\n476\n00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.425\nthen the rule that I set up, right?\n\n477\n00:26:25.425 --> 00:26:30.452\nBut once you know that basic format of\na rule you can interpret this, right?\n\n478\n00:26:30.452 --> 00:26:34.790\nIf we take here is\nalert,we've seen that,ICMP so\n\n479\n00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.930\nit's gonna pull that\nvariable from the conf file\n\n480\n00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.850\nto learn what that is,home net and\nthat's why it's important you set\n\n481\n00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:46.050\nthose variable otherwise these rules\nwon't be able to pull that information.\n\n482\n00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.730\nAny port number ICMP echo reply and\n\n483\n00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:54.330\nit's looking at particular ICMP types so\nit's not getting all ICMPs.\n\n484\n00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.805\nBecause this one is just echo reply.\n\n485\n00:26:56.805 --> 00:26:58.220\nThey've got another one for\n\n486\n00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.220\ndestination unreachable that's\ngonna be ICMP type 3 over there.\n\n487\n00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:07.190\nNow you see they've assigned it an SID\n408 and then there revision number five.\n\n488\n00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.700\nSo it's exactly like\nthe simple rule that we wrote.\n\n489\n00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:15.210\nThere's just a lot more of them here,\nall right?\n\n490\n00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:15.710\nAnother one.\n\n491\n00:27:18.404 --> 00:27:21.140\nNow this one in fact,\nwe should go back up to the top.\n\n492\n00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.580\nI know we're getting close on time here.\n\n493\n00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.390\nIf I go back up to the top,\nthere is a little comment here.\n\n494\n00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:28.010\nAnd it'll show me this contains\nproprietary rules that were created,\n\n495\n00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.360\ntested and certified by Sourcefire.\n\n496\n00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.260\nWe were talking about Cisco there.\n\n497\n00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.960\nLittle bit of integration.\n\n498\n00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.520\nSo some of these are copyrighted.\n\n499\n00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.430\nBut these rules are standard\nICMP traffic rules.\n\n500\n00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.560\nThey include things like OS ping.\n\n501\n00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.090\nSo when somebody is pinging\nsomebody on your network,\n\n502\n00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.410\nas well as the normal\nrouting done by ICMP,\n\n503\n00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:51.680\nthey will catch all rules that\nwill alert of unknown ICMP types.\n\n504\n00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.260\nThis is what I wanted you to see here,\n\n505\n00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:57.090\npotentially bad ICMP rules\nare included in ICMP rules.\n\n506\n00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:03.410\nSo this particular rule set is really\ngonna capture almost all ICMP traffic.\n\n507\n00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.500\nThat could generate, if ICMP is\nsomething we use on our network,\n\n508\n00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.900\nthat could generate a lot\nof information in my logs.\n\n509\n00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.360\nIf I'm troubleshooting,\nI might wanna fire this one up.\n\n510\n00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.800\nOtherwise, this might\nnot be the one I want.\n\n511\n00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:22.270\nMaybe I should rather go with\nICMP rules without the info.\n\n512\n00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.630\nLet's take a look at this rule set.\n\n513\n00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:27.130\nAnd we're gonna scroll back up to\nthe top here, oops, of this one.\n\n514\n00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:33.410\nAnd we'll see these rules\nare potentially bad ICMP traffic.\n\n515\n00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:34.940\nSo in this case, it's not gonna look for\n\n516\n00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.850\njust a standard ping from\none machine to the other.\n\n517\n00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:45.010\nIt's looking for oddities known types\nof attack vectors that are using ping.\n\n518\n00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:47.580\nBad ICMP traffic.\n\n519\n00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.170\nSo if I'm setting this up as an IDS\n\n520\n00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:52.860\nthis might be more the rule\nsets that I want to use.\n\n521\n00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.450\nSo the point here is there are lots\nof rule sets that are available.\n\n522\n00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.230\nYou don't want to just enable all of them.\n\n523\n00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:01.010\nJust don't go and\nuncomment all those rules.\n\n524\n00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.420\nYou'll end up with some huge logs.\n\n525\n00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.010\nAnd a lot of the information\nis not actually necessary.\n\n526\n00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:09.540\nSo you want to make sure you understand\nwhat rule set you are applying.\n\n527\n00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.690\nAnd within the rules themselves there's\ntypically some good comments that tell you\n\n528\n00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:13.630\nwhat they do.\n\n529\n00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.540\nAnd you can have separate\nconfiguration files.\n\n530\n00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:21.450\nMaybe you wanna fire up one cuff that\npulls those ICMP-info rules, right, and\n\n531\n00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:23.830\nsome other informational type rules.\n\n532\n00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:27.810\nBut then for your normal everyday\nrunning of Snort as an IDS,\n\n533\n00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.140\nyou got a separate com file\nthat pulls different rules.\n\n534\n00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:36.640\nSets, right, that's doing more of an IDS\nand only looking for bad traffic on there.\n\n535\n00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.830\nThe last thing I wanna show you now that\nwe've looked at that config file, one of\n\n536\n00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:44.920\nthe things you will wanna do with Snort\nand most IDSs, you wanna test it out.\n\n537\n00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.810\nAnd there's an easy way to do that\nwithout actually firing it up.\n\n538\n00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:52.400\nSnort oops, that's not,\nlet's do snort dash,\n\n539\n00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:58.910\nmy typing has just gone to heck\nright here, -T, that's not a dash.\n\n540\n00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.940\nLet's try it again, -T is what we want.\n\n541\n00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:07.768\nCapital T for test and then -c and\n\n542\n00:30:07.768 --> 00:30:11.909\nmy snort, conf, I'm sorry\n\n543\n00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:18.098\nsnort/conf, I'm just gonna slow\nmy typing down just a little bit.\n\n544\n00:30:21.804 --> 00:30:26.227\nAnd what this is gonna do is just\nrun through it, initialize it, and\n\n545\n00:30:26.227 --> 00:30:29.540\nthen shut down and\nnot actually do anything.\n\n546\n00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.770\nSo you see it going through the same\nthings we saw when we fired up Snort.\n\n547\n00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:34.730\nLet me let it finish.\n\n548\n00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:39.130\nAnd then you'll see Snort successfully\nvalidated the configuration,\n\n549\n00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.560\nSnort is exiting.\n\n550\n00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:45.070\nAnd things you would want to check,\nall right, let's scroll back up.\n\n551\n00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.890\nAnd what we would wanna see is,\n\n552\n00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:55.940\nit read 4,150 Snort rules,\n3,476 of those are detection rules.\n\n553\n00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:00.460\nAgain, this is IDS, so we're not doing a\nlot of other types of rules that we might\n\n554\n00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.870\nactually take action,\nthey're all detection rules.\n\n555\n00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:06.100\nI do have an issue, I haven't updated\nthis, so you see that I'm getting a lot of\n\n556\n00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.680\nwarnings about some of these being rules,\nbeing duplicates.\n\n557\n00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.610\nWhich is why I have 4,100 read, but\nonly 3,476 detection rules being applies,\n\n558\n00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:16.570\njust because I haven't\nupdating my thing and\n\n559\n00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:20.400\nit's got a lot of\nduplicate rules in there.\n\n560\n00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:25.530\nBut you can see a lot of source, a lot of\ndestination rules, a lot of any rules.\n\n561\n00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.010\nSo a lot of good information there,\nand lets you test your config,\n\n562\n00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:31.220\nlets you know everything is working\nbefore we actually fire up Snort,\n\n563\n00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.107\nwalk away, come back and\ngo why didn't we detect anything?\n\n564\n00:31:34.107 --> 00:31:35.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why is my log file empty?\n\n565\n00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:41.840\nAll right, so that's a little look\nat IDS's in general, what they\n\n566\n00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:46.480\ncan be capable of, and in particular Snort\nwhich is one of my faves to play with.\n\n567\n00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.870\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely an interesting tool.\n\n568\n00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.330\nIt's been around for a while.\n\n569\n00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.524\nIt's very a lot of people like it.\n\n570\n00:31:51.524 --> 00:31:54.690\nThere's a well built community\naround it like Mike showed us.\n\n571\n00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:58.490\nThere's people developing rule sets for\nus that are very good at that.\n\n572\n00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:59.710\nLet them do the heavy lifting.\n\n573\n00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.010\nWhy should we reinvent the wheel\nif it's already out there?\n\n574\n00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.290\nJust make sure that you're updating it.\n\n575\n00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:06.780\nMaking it as latest and\ngreatest as possible.\n\n576\n00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.780\nSo that you're detecting\nall the more modern\n\n577\n00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.770\nproblems that might\ninfiltrate in your system.\n\n578\n00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:17.170\nThat being said, Mike, great look into\nSnort and understanding what an IDS is,\n\n579\n00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.040\nkind of how it works, gave us a good\nlook at that, we appreciate that.\n\n580\n00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.900\nAnd that being said, I'm looking\nat our clock and the time is gone.\n\n581\n00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.790\nSo we are gonna have to sign off for\ntoday.\n\n582\n00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:27.800\nBut we do thank you for joining us.\n\n583\n00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.730\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n584\n00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:31.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n585\n00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:32.738\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n586\n00:32:32.738 --> 00:32:40.332\n[MUSIC]\n\n587\n00:32:40.332 --> 00:32:43.076\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:08.312\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:12.480\nYou're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.130\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n7\n00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.540\nGreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.610\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.430\nAnd in today's episode, we are back\nwith more on our CSA plus series.\n\n10\n00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.260\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio\nis the man guiding us through this and\n\n11\n00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.690\nletting his expertise to the topic our\ngood friend and expert, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.430\nMike, welcome back.\n\n13\n00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.390\nSir, how is it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.160\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.380\nThanks for having me back,\nexcited as always to be here.\n\n16\n00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.300\nAnd especially, right now because we're\ngetting ready to play with one of my\n\n17\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.550\nfavorite tools and\nthat is Wireshark, right?\n\n18\n00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.550\nAs we've done in the past episodes,\nwe were trying to pick different\n\n19\n00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.630\ntools out of categories to demonstrate\nnot because any one particular tool is\n\n20\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.570\nmore important than the other\nas far as the exam is concerned.\n\n21\n00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.230\nBut give you an idea of each within each\ncategory, what these tools are capable of,\n\n22\n00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.600\nas being familiar with what tool would be\nappropriate if I need to capture traffic.\n\n23\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.540\nOr if I need to set up intrusion\ndetection and things like that.\n\n24\n00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.420\nSo, Wireshark is the one I want to use for\ncollecting data or packet.\n\n25\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.140\nReally this covers a lot, right?\n\n26\n00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.410\nPacket analysis,\nprotocol analysis, packet capture.\n\n27\n00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.250\nSo, a lot of things occur\nhere within Wireshark.\n\n28\n00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.120\nWe'll go again through that\nlist of different tools.\n\n29\n00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.660\nActually, we did that\nin a previous episode.\n\n30\n00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, we've got that covered.\n\n31\n00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.470\nAll right, so Wireshark,\nagain, packet capture utility,\n\n32\n00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.810\nbeen around for a long time.\n\n33\n00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.210\nIt is probably the go-to packet capture\nutility for a lot of people out there.\n\n34\n00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.940\nBecause one, it's been around forever,\nIt's very well matured as a product.\n\n35\n00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.580\nA lot of support,\n\n36\n00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.990\na lot of integration with other tools as\nwell because it is that de facto standard.\n\n37\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.290\nYou'll find that it integrates well\nwith a lot of different things.\n\n38\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.430\nSo, it used to be called,\nhow do you say it, Daniel?\n\n39\n00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.840\nThe old-\n&gt;&gt; Ethereal.\n\n40\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.500\n&gt;&gt; Ethereal.\n\n41\n00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.700\n&gt;&gt; But some or\na lot of people call it uthereal.\n\n42\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.730\nI always want to say ethereal\nbecause I like that.\n\n43\n00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.400\n&gt;&gt; It sounds cool.\n\n44\n00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that word.\n\n45\n00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.780\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\n\n46\n00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.650\nI used to say ether real.\n\n47\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.530\nAnd people would look at me like,\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n48\n00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.970\nBut after those guys split up and\nsome issues with naming conventions or\n\n49\n00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.012\nnames this became WireShark.\n\n50\n00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:27.910\nAll right.\n\n51\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.480\nSo, let's launch WireShark,\nget this fired up.\n\n52\n00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.796\nAnd again,\n\n53\n00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:37.940\nyou can use Wireshark right out of\nthe box with very minimal configuration.\n\n54\n00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.170\nBut there is a lot that I can\ndo with Wireshark as well.\n\n55\n00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.760\nSo, the first thing I need to\ndo if I'm gonna capture traffic,\n\n56\n00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.080\nI need to tell it what interface,\nI want to listen on.\n\n57\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.759\nSo, right up here on this intro\nscreen is my interface list.\n\n58\n00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.870\nI'll click on that.\n\n59\n00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.620\nIt's gonna show me the network adapters\nthat it sees in this machine, and\n\n60\n00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.180\nI can pick the one I want to listen on.\n\n61\n00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.690\nSo, I'm gonna grab my wireless\nnetwork adapter here.\n\n62\n00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.190\nAnd I'll go ahead and click.\n\n63\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.770\nI could start it from right,\nlet's just go ahead and start it.\n\n64\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.700\nWe'll go ahead and click, start.\n\n65\n00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.890\n&gt;&gt; Let's just capture some data Mike.\n\n66\n00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's get this ball rolling,\nall right?\n\n67\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.180\nAnd you can see, packets flying by.\n\n68\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.420\n&gt;&gt; It's going crazy.\n\n69\n00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.300\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n70\n00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.010\n&gt;&gt; A lot of colors there.\n\n71\n00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.064\n&gt;&gt; And you know what I wanna do,\nis I wanna also do some,\n\n72\n00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:24.480\nlet's go out to it-\n&gt;&gt; Apparently, it launches edge routers.\n\n73\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n74\n00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.810\n&gt;&gt; I just wanna\n\n75\n00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.290\ngrab some interesting traffic.\n\n76\n00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.450\nSo, I'm gonna go out to a web page\nhere and open it up real quick.\n\n77\n00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.920\nI say real quick but\nit is definitely taking its time.\n\n78\n00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.200\nLike that.\n\n79\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.550\n&gt;&gt; That new Edge is a screamer.\n\n80\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.003\n&gt;&gt; It really is, isn't it?\n\n81\n00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:42.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's not like I didn't open this\n\n82\n00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.335\npage right before this show.\n\n83\n00:03:44.335 --> 00:03:45.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just to make sure everything\n\n84\n00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.605\nwas working.\n\n85\n00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:47.880\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And yet there it is.\n\n86\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.100\nEdge, your new favorite browser.\n\n87\n00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.800\nAll right, I'm gonna close my browser and\n\n88\n00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.910\nthen I'm gonna click on this little red\nbutton up here to stop by capturing.\n\n89\n00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.770\nThat was just to give us some data\nwork with nothing in particular there.\n\n90\n00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.360\nSo, all right, now let's get\nback into how Wireshark works,\n\n91\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.450\nhow we will work with this.\n\n92\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.790\nThat intro screen is\nsomething you can change.\n\n93\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.760\nIt doesn't have to open up every\ntime when you open up Wireshark.\n\n94\n00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.760\nIf you ever need to get back\nto your list of interfaces,\n\n95\n00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.800\nright up here in the corner,\nis my show interfaces list.\n\n96\n00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.230\nAnd I can see,\nI can go back through those interfaces and\n\n97\n00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.270\npick which one I want to work with.\n\n98\n00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.540\nAll right, now.\n\n99\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.880\nNext thing,\nI wanna show you is working with profiles.\n\n100\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.260\nBecause, like I said, out of the box,\nWireshark does a pretty good job.\n\n101\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.580\nActually, let's take a look at\nwhat we've got here so far.\n\n102\n00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.720\nWe've got basically three panes.\n\n103\n00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.320\nThe top pane, these are actual packets.\n\n104\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.750\nEach one of these lines is\na packet that it's captured.\n\n105\n00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.000\nAnd then, in this middle pane,\nis the breakdown of that packet.\n\n106\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.540\nSo, when I select this packet, I can come\nover here and I can look and I can see\n\n107\n00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.990\nframe details, I can go down to ethernet,\nI can see that it's an ARP packet.\n\n108\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.070\nAnd then, I can get into the ARP header\ninformation, or the ARP information, and\n\n109\n00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.450\nI can see what it's doing there,\nall right?\n\n110\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.790\nSo, this is the breakdown of the packet.\n\n111\n00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.790\nAnd then,\ndown below is the actual pocket itself.\n\n112\n00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.270\nThis is the hex values and\nthen the decoded information right here.\n\n113\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.790\nIt's decoding that hex into\nsometimes readable, sometimes\n\n114\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.460\nnot readable information, depends if\nthat traffic is protected, right?\n\n115\n00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.000\nIf it's encrypted or not, if it's\nplain text It will show up right here.\n\n116\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.550\nSo, if you're capturing, if somebody's\nsending an email and it's not secure and\n\n117\n00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.850\nyou capture those packets of that email\nthat's being sent across the network,\n\n118\n00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.520\nyou can read the email right\nthere in that information.\n\n119\n00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.330\nIf somebody's copying a file across your\nnetwork and it's not a secure connection\n\n120\n00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.496\nor you'll be able to read it\nright there in this bottom pane.\n\n121\n00:05:47.496 --> 00:05:49.810\nYou know log on traffic, if it's HTTP,\n\n122\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.670\nit should show up as plain\ntext right there, all right?\n\n123\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.460\nSo, let's talk about profiles next.\n\n124\n00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.780\nA couple of things, let's go to Edit.\n\n125\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.570\nAnd then, configuration profiles.\n\n126\n00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.490\nAnd I actually have a couple of\nprofiles that I've already created.\n\n127\n00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.740\nThere is the default profile, right?\n\n128\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.910\nBut then I've added a couple.\n\n129\n00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.390\nI've got one that I call Analysis.\n\n130\n00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.530\nI've got another one that I\ncall Absolute TCP Sequence.\n\n131\n00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.720\nAnd these profiles allow me to store\nconfiguration changes for Wireshark.\n\n132\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.290\nSo, that when I'm doing\ndifferent projects, right,\n\n133\n00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.460\nI don't have to go and\nreconfigure everything every time.\n\n134\n00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.030\nCuz there's times I want\ndifferent information to be\n\n135\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.910\nmore readily available in my view, so\nI can use these profiles to do that.\n\n136\n00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.600\nYou can create new profiles\nwith this New button.\n\n137\n00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.580\nWhat else do I want to show you here.\n\n138\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.990\nSo, what I've done, I don't think I\ncan actually see the profile though.\n\n139\n00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.290\nThat's the only crazy thing.\n\n140\n00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.730\nI can't go back in and see the profile.\n\n141\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.010\nSo, I don't think it'll let me.\n\n142\n00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.410\nSo, let's make a new one and\nI'll show you what this is all about.\n\n143\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.670\nSo, I'm going to click new, and\n\n144\n00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.920\nI'm just going to call this one\nCSAPlus and I'll click, okay.\n\n145\n00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.050\nAnd then, I'm gonna go back over here.\n\n146\n00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.770\nI do know where I can go,\nlet's go configuration profiles.\n\n147\n00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:16.310\nOnce, I created that profile, I'm gonna\ngo to configuration profiles, all right?\n\n148\n00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.120\nAnd then, it's not what I wanted, mate.\n\n149\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.910\nCrazy guy.\nLet's go back where we were.\n\n150\n00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.070\nLet's go edit and then preferences,\nthat's where we want.\n\n151\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.450\nFirst time,\nwe opened up configuration profiles, and\n\n152\n00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.858\nthen we opened up preferences.\n\n153\n00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:29.410\nAnd which ever one you had selected\nin that configuration profile,\n\n154\n00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.190\nis the one that's gonna be loaded up.\n\n155\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.480\nAnd then,\nwhen you change your preferences,\n\n156\n00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.940\nthat's how you edit a preference, right?\n\n157\n00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.880\nYou've load up the config, and\nthen you make changes to your preference.\n\n158\n00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.720\nIt's stored in that config.\n\n159\n00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.250\nAnd then,\n\n160\n00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.470\nif I switch to a different config,\nit goes to whatever I've loaded up there.\n\n161\n00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.430\nSo in this case,\nI can see right at the top Profile CSA+.\n\n162\n00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.604\nAnd now, I can make changes to this.\n\n163\n00:07:50.604 --> 00:07:53.578\nAnd what I typically,\nthere's a few things that I like to do.\n\n164\n00:07:53.578 --> 00:07:56.841\nYou can go through your layout,\nhow your panes are defined.\n\n165\n00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:58.041\nBut this one here,\n\n166\n00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:02.398\ncolumns Is one that I typically will\nmake some changes in my profile.\n\n167\n00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:04.940\nBecause there's information\nthat I want to see.\n\n168\n00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.890\nThese are my default fields\nthat are shown out there.\n\n169\n00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.855\nBut if I wanna add a new field,\nI just click Add down here at the bottom.\n\n170\n00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:12.587\nI give it a name.\n\n171\n00:08:12.587 --> 00:08:18.612\nMaybe I wanna call this one,\nI'll do the one I always do, UTC.\n\n172\n00:08:18.612 --> 00:08:22.436\nAnd then for the value,\nI'm gonna hit my drop down list.\n\n173\n00:08:22.436 --> 00:08:23.226\nAnd I'm gonna choose UTC date.\n\n174\n00:08:23.226 --> 00:08:27.242\nAnd then my particular format\nof date that I'd like to use.\n\n175\n00:08:27.242 --> 00:08:33.358\nAnd so I've just added a column\nto this and I'll click OK.\n\n176\n00:08:33.358 --> 00:08:37.039\nAnd you'll see that there's a new\ncolumn in my results, right?\n\n177\n00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.923\nWhere I can see the actual date and\ntime and\n\n178\n00:08:39.923 --> 00:08:44.410\nthis is one that I will use\nwhen I'm doing correlations.\n\n179\n00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.780\nWhen I have to look at traces\nfrom different systems.\n\n180\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:55.270\nI don't want just the general time offset\nfrom when the packets are recorded.\n\n181\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.008\nI need to know what\nthe actual UTC time was.\n\n182\n00:08:58.008 --> 00:09:01.074\nCuz I wanna make sure that I'm\npulling the right information, or\n\n183\n00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:03.740\ncomparing the right information, right?\n\n184\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.899\nWe've all done it.\nWe've been out there, you've pulled up.\n\n185\n00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:08.511\nYou're looking at a trace,\nand you're examining it,\n\n186\n00:09:08.511 --> 00:09:10.520\njust to realize you've got the wrong one.\n\n187\n00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.505\nYou got the one from yesterday,\ninstead of today.\n\n188\n00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:15.956\nAnd, if you're trying to compare\ntraces from two different systems or\n\n189\n00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:18.668\ntwo different networks trying\nto analyze some attack.\n\n190\n00:09:18.668 --> 00:09:23.519\nVery important.that we're looking at the\nsame time frame from those two different\n\n191\n00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:24.210\nnetworks.\n\n192\n00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.970\nSo showing that UTC column is\none that I like, you might or\n\n193\n00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.310\nmight not find that useful.\n\n194\n00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.692\nAnother one that I like to do\nis the sequence stoppers, right?\n\n195\n00:09:34.692 --> 00:09:38.960\nWhen you look at the sequence stoppers,\nlet me find some TCP packets here.\n\n196\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.201\nAnd those are having some issues.\n\n197\n00:09:41.201 --> 00:09:42.402\nWe can probably still use them.\n\n198\n00:09:42.402 --> 00:09:45.280\nAnd here's a typical TCP packet.\n\n199\n00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.596\nAnd when we look inside here.\n\n200\n00:09:46.596 --> 00:09:49.465\nWe know that there's going\nto be a sequence number and\n\n201\n00:09:49.465 --> 00:09:52.680\nan acknowledgement number,\ntypically, all right?\n\n202\n00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.650\nBut notice what it says next to that,\nrelative sequence number.\n\n203\n00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.370\nWhat that means is it's relative\nto this particular capture.\n\n204\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:07.290\nAnd while that might do me good when I'm\nlooking at a particular conversation,\n\n205\n00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.840\nI can see which packets,\nthe order they were in.\n\n206\n00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.660\nA lot of times, I really need to\nsee the actual sequence number.\n\n207\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.276\nFor human readability, seeing that\nsequence number definitely makes\n\n208\n00:10:18.276 --> 00:10:20.935\nit a little bit easier cuz\nit's a nice short number.\n\n209\n00:10:20.935 --> 00:10:24.346\nBut let me go into my other view here.\n\n210\n00:10:24.346 --> 00:10:29.260\nWe're gonna go back to\nConfiguration Profiles.\n\n211\n00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.820\nAnd I'm gonna do my absolute\nTPCP sequence and I'll click OK.\n\n212\n00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.970\nAll right, and now when we look,\nlook at the sequence number now.\n\n213\n00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:44.040\nThat's a standard, that's the actual\nsequence number from the TCP packet.\n\n214\n00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.600\nMuch longer, gosh I should know how many\nbytes that is off the top of my head,\n\n215\n00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.050\nbut I can't remember.\n\n216\n00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.690\nBut that's the actual sequence number.\n\n217\n00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.120\nAnd sometimes I need to\nsee that information.\n\n218\n00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.957\nNot as easy as a human to work with\nnumbers that big and go, okay,\n\n219\n00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:59.598\nwhat's the next packet that\nI'm looking for in this list?\n\n220\n00:10:59.598 --> 00:11:03.033\nIt should be 34,655,000 no wait,\nthat's 346 million.\n\n221\n00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:08.690\nAnd you see how it can be\ndifficult to work with.\n\n222\n00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.490\nSo I like to be able to flip back and\n\n223\n00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.970\nforth between the relative sequence\nnumbers and the absolute sequence numbers.\n\n224\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.264\nSo some things I can do there.\n\n225\n00:11:16.264 --> 00:11:20.073\nYou can also basically add any\ncolumn you want to your view.\n\n226\n00:11:20.073 --> 00:11:22.370\nLet's find another one.\n\n227\n00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:26.020\nI don't know, well just for\nrandomness, window size value.\n\n228\n00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.650\nMaybe that's something that I\nreally need to see in my output.\n\n229\n00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.600\nI can just right-click on that and\nchoose Apply as a column.\n\n230\n00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.800\nAnd now if I scroll over,\nactually there it is right there.\n\n231\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.110\nThere is my window size value.\n\n232\n00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:45.250\nSo any field in the packet itself\nyou can simply right-click on and\n\n233\n00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.550\nchoose Apply as a column, and\nit will add it to your column up here.\n\n234\n00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.290\nSo now I don't have to go and expand\nout each one of these to dive down and\n\n235\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.330\nsee in this case that window size value,\nright?\n\n236\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.290\nI can add it right to it, and\nyou can rearrange these columns.\n\n237\n00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.070\nYou can take the most important ones and\nput them towards the front.\n\n238\n00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.060\nSo that you don't have to\nscroll horizontally to find.\n\n239\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.870\nSo very, very customizable.\n\n240\n00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.470\nSet it up to where it works best for you.\n\n241\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:15.410\nAnd again, most packet capturers\nhave some of these capabilities.\n\n242\n00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.630\nAll right, let's take a look at,\n\n243\n00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.000\nthe last one I'll show you\nhere is the color coding.\n\n244\n00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:28.180\nThere's a button right up here that\nwill turn the color coding on and off.\n\n245\n00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.960\nSee how that will turn it off?\n\n246\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.040\nSome people find this very distracting.\n\n247\n00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.540\nThe different colors have meaning.\n\n248\n00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.904\nWhen we look at our preferences And\n\n249\n00:12:38.904 --> 00:12:43.823\nwe look at our colors, slowly but\nsurely you can go in here and\n\n250\n00:12:43.823 --> 00:12:47.700\nyou can change these\ncolors to meet your needs.\n\n251\n00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.790\nBut DNS is dark blue,\nTCP is a purple color.\n\n252\n00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.600\nAnd ARP I think is if I remember\nright orange or yellow.\n\n253\n00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.560\nYeah, there you go, yeah.\n\n254\n00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.770\n&gt;&gt; I personally find\nthe colors very helpful.\n\n255\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.670\nBecause I can just look for the color.\n\n256\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.566\nI can order the list, and\nthen just look for the block of color.\n\n257\n00:13:04.566 --> 00:13:06.520\nAnd go,\nthere's everything I'm looking for.\n\n258\n00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.115\nI know where it starts,\nI know where it stops.\n\n259\n00:13:08.115 --> 00:13:11.790\nSo, if it's in the middle of a large\ncapture I can easily find that.\n\n260\n00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.194\nI really like the color system.\n\n261\n00:13:13.194 --> 00:13:16.650\n&gt;&gt; I'm with you because I can\nscroll very fast through this list.\n\n262\n00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.827\nAnd immediately pick out, wait,\nthere are my TCP packets, all right,\n\n263\n00:13:20.827 --> 00:13:22.234\nthat are sitting there.\n\n264\n00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:23.270\nSo I'm with you.\n\n265\n00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.130\nI like the color-coding as well, but\nif you don't like it, hey, turn it off.\n\n266\n00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.170\nIt's as easy as clicking\nthis button right up there.\n\n267\n00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.565\nThe one right next to\nit is the autoscroll.\n\n268\n00:13:31.565 --> 00:13:36.384\nAnother feature that some people\nfind annoying, other people really,\n\n269\n00:13:36.384 --> 00:13:40.930\nreally like, and I lost one of my\npanes there, is the autoscroll.\n\n270\n00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.470\nWhen you're doing a capture,\n\n271\n00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.540\nautoscroll means you'll always see\nthe last packet at the bottom.\n\n272\n00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.760\nBut you saw how fast those\npackets were flying in.\n\n273\n00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:54.170\nIt's gonna scroll by really fast even\non a network that's not that busy.\n\n274\n00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.581\nSo then you try to scroll up\nto see something that went by.\n\n275\n00:13:56.581 --> 00:13:59.930\nAs soon as the next packet comes in it\ntries to jump back down to the bottom.\n\n276\n00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.360\nSo you can turn that on and\n\n277\n00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.970\noff with that little button there allowing\nthat to scroll or not autoscroll.\n\n278\n00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.425\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike,\nwe've looked at the interface.\n\n279\n00:14:09.425 --> 00:14:12.323\nWe've played around with\ngetting our feet wet,\n\n280\n00:14:12.323 --> 00:14:15.870\nkinda getting immersed\ninto the Wireshark world.\n\n281\n00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.385\nNow, let's talk about the real\npower when it comes to Wireshark.\n\n282\n00:14:18.385 --> 00:14:22.740\nAnd that is being able to filter\nout what I don't want and\n\n283\n00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.282\nwhat I do want, and very powerfully so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\n\n284\n00:14:27.282 --> 00:14:30.540\na nd we'll just get into what you call\nthe meat and potatoes of this part, right.\n\n285\n00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n286\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.383\n&gt;&gt; Honestly what we've done so far is as\nDaniel said, we're just configuring it.\n\n287\n00:14:33.383 --> 00:14:34.390\n&gt;&gt; That was the appetizer.\n\n288\n00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was the appetizer.\n\n289\n00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.670\nWe're just configuring the interface\nto where it's convenient for\n\n290\n00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.460\nus, or it's showing the right information.\n\n291\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.600\nAnd really the main thing I was\ntrying to get for you guys,\n\n292\n00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.620\nwas to show you that what you\nsee is not all that you get.\n\n293\n00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.938\nThere is a lot more that you can do.\n\n294\n00:14:47.938 --> 00:14:51.740\nYou can show all kinds of columns,\nreally powerful stuff.\n\n295\n00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.710\nBut, as Daniel said as well,\nit's the filtering.\n\n296\n00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.110\nThat's where we need to focus on.\n\n297\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.580\nThat's what I need to\nuse to be able to find.\n\n298\n00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.050\nBecause, when you're looking at a capture,\nhow long did we run this, Daniel?\n\n299\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.930\n&gt;&gt; A few seconds, maybe 30 seconds.\n\n300\n00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.808\n&gt;&gt; I mean, and let's see.\n\n301\n00:15:06.808 --> 00:15:10.992\nIf we go down to the bottom 1207\npackets that I captured there.\n\n302\n00:15:10.992 --> 00:15:15.518\nAnd as you said, less than a minute\nthat we were running that,\n\n303\n00:15:15.518 --> 00:15:18.140\nit was just 30 seconds at the top.\n\n304\n00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.278\n&gt;&gt; I'm surprised Wireshark doesn't say.\n\n305\n00:15:20.278 --> 00:15:21.370\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] output somewhere.\n\n306\n00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.121\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It probably does somewhere.\n\n307\n00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:22.808\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it probably does.\n\n308\n00:15:22.808 --> 00:15:24.550\n&gt;&gt; And if you think about it,\n\n309\n00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:30.690\nI'm on a very small little test network\nhere on a large corporate environment.\n\n310\n00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.160\nJust, it's a very large file,\nvery, very fast.\n\n311\n00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.800\nSo being able to filter, very important.\n\n312\n00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.008\nSo let's take a look at some of\nthe different filters we can do.\n\n313\n00:15:39.008 --> 00:15:42.839\nI do want to differentiate some terms we\nneed to be familiar with or understand,\n\n314\n00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:44.794\ncapture filter versus display filter.\n\n315\n00:15:44.794 --> 00:15:47.875\nAnd this is, again,\nsomething that almost all packet capture,\n\n316\n00:15:47.875 --> 00:15:50.150\nprotocol analyzers allow you to do.\n\n317\n00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.912\nA capture filter is applied\nbefore the packets are captured.\n\n318\n00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:55.759\nDoes this meet the filter?\n\n319\n00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:57.576\nIf it does, capture the packet.\n\n320\n00:15:57.576 --> 00:16:01.545\nIf it doesn't, discard the packet,\ndon't capture it.\n\n321\n00:16:01.545 --> 00:16:05.540\nWhereas a display filter is\napplied after the capture.\n\n322\n00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.340\nWe're gonna capture everything and\n\n323\n00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.910\nthen you can just filter out\nwhat you don't want to see.\n\n324\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.890\nBut if you take the filter away,\neverything comes back, right?\n\n325\n00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.260\nSo what should you use?\n\n326\n00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.450\nCapture filters or display filters?\n\n327\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.440\nMost likely both.\n\n328\n00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.670\nIt really depends on your scenario.\n\n329\n00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:26.490\nNo capture filters guarantees that\nI'm gonna get just about everything.\n\n330\n00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.750\nNow, that means I also have\na much larger file and\n\n331\n00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.805\nI've really gotta work my display filters\nto find the pertinent information.\n\n332\n00:16:32.805 --> 00:16:37.975\nUsing a capture filter allows me to really\nfocus in and capture just specific data.\n\n333\n00:16:37.975 --> 00:16:41.235\nBut it also means that after the fact,\nI can't see any other data,\n\n334\n00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:43.255\nI can't undo the capture filter.\n\n335\n00:16:43.255 --> 00:16:46.375\nIt's already captured,\nit's already a file, it's done, right?\n\n336\n00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:51.330\nSo sometimes I don't use capture filters\nat all, and if I'm just searching and\n\n337\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.150\ntrying to see what's going on,\nI don't use capture filters.\n\n338\n00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.910\nAll right,\n\n339\n00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.880\nthen I'll have to use my display\nfilters to find what I'm looking for.\n\n340\n00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.650\nBut if I'm looking for\n\n341\n00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:02.780\nsomething in particular, I know I'm\nhaving a problem with DNS queries.\n\n342\n00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.200\nWell, that's all I wanna capture is\nDNS information so that I have a nice,\n\n343\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.690\nconcise log that's really\nfocused in on my problem.\n\n344\n00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.160\nSo I'll use a capture filter there.\n\n345\n00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:17.330\nCapture filters are gonna be done back\nover when you choose your interface.\n\n346\n00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.738\nHere I can see capture filter.\n\n347\n00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:22.770\nAnd Wireshark is actually pretty\nsmart I don't know if you can see\n\n348\n00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:23.920\nthat it says not port 3389.\n\n349\n00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.430\nBecause it realizes that I'm running this\non a VM and I am remote desktop into this\n\n350\n00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.150\nVM so it's like, you probably\nreally wanna ignore that traffic.\n\n351\n00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.850\nAnd so it's blocking that for me.\n\n352\n00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.770\nSo it actually is applying\na small capture filter there.\n\n353\n00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.910\nAnd it's not to say you can't do both,\nright?\n\n354\n00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:42.410\nYou could set a capture filter\nthat gets rid of ARP and ICMP.\n\n355\n00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.770\nAnd then you've got a file\nthat's almost complete and\n\n356\n00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.510\nyou can still use a display\nfilter just to show DNS traffic.\n\n357\n00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.440\nBut the cool thing is if you remove\nthe display, everything's back except for\n\n358\n00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.970\nARP and ICMP cuz you did\na capture filter on those.\n\n359\n00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.970\nAll right, so\nnow let's see how we actually write these.\n\n360\n00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.920\nWe'll stick with our display filters,\nbut same concept.\n\n361\n00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.819\nI mean, the filters are the same\nwhether you're applying it before or\n\n362\n00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:05.663\nafter the capture.\n\n363\n00:18:05.663 --> 00:18:12.606\nSo let's take a look at a simple one\nthat we might wanna do, IP.addr, right?\n\n364\n00:18:12.606 --> 00:18:16.330\nIP.addr, IP.addr, evil evil.\n\n365\n00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.283\nAnd you know what?\n\n366\n00:18:17.283 --> 00:18:24.670\nI didn't actually make any traffic over\nto, hm, I probably should have done that.\n\n367\n00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:29.490\nLet's see if there's any 10.0.100.200.\n\n368\n00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.050\nAnd I have none.\n\n369\n00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.129\nSo let's try something\na little bit different.\n\n370\n00:18:35.997 --> 00:18:39.152\nLet's get rid of my filter and\nwe'll just clear that and\n\n371\n00:18:39.152 --> 00:18:40.909\nget all of these packets back.\n\n372\n00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:45.340\nAnd let's see, I've got some\ninteresting traffic, looks like 10.157.\n\n373\n00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:54.010\nSo ip.addr == 10.0.10.157.\n\n374\n00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:59.090\nAnd so now if we look, all of\nthe traffic has 10.157 in it, right?\n\n375\n00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:05.370\nWhen you use a filter like this,\nIP.addr ==,\n\n376\n00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.710\nyou're saying it could be\nanywhere in the packet.\n\n377\n00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.890\nIt could be the source, these could be\npackets coming from that address but\n\n378\n00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.820\nit also could be\nthe destination of traffic,\n\n379\n00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.060\nboth of those would be displayed\nwith that particular filter.\n\n380\n00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.250\nSo anything that has to do with\nthat particular IP address.\n\n381\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.510\nI might wanna see just traffic\ncoming from that address.\n\n382\n00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.940\nOr just traffic going to that address.\n\n383\n00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.100\nIn that case,\nwe're gonna do something like this.\n\n384\n00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.550\nWe'll do IP., let's do.\n\n385\n00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:36.250\nLet's see, dst.\n\n386\n00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.210\nOops, I can't type dst.\n\n387\n00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.310\nAll right, which would be destination.\n\n388\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:44.350\nLooks like no traffic was bound for\nthat particular machine.\n\n389\n00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:49.330\nIf we do src, we'll see the traffic\nthat was coming from that machine.\n\n390\n00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.960\nSo, when you do the IP.addr,\n\n391\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.260\nit's basically like doing an or\nclause, cuz I can do the same thing.\n\n392\n00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.109\nHow can I show you this?\n\n393\n00:20:00.109 --> 00:20:06.715\nSo IP.addr, source or destination,\n\n394\n00:20:06.715 --> 00:20:11.319\nI could also do ip.src= or\n\n395\n00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:20.741\nip.dest == 10.0.10.157 and hit Enter.\n\n396\n00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:25.087\nAnd you see the list doesn't\nchange because doing it that way,\n\n397\n00:20:25.087 --> 00:20:29.597\nsaying either the source is 157 or\nthe destination is 157 is\n\n398\n00:20:29.597 --> 00:20:34.037\nthe same thing as doing\nip.addr equals 10.157, right?\n\n399\n00:20:34.037 --> 00:20:36.680\nSo just a different way to\naccomplish the same thing.\n\n400\n00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.430\nBut if I showed you this one because\nits like use an or statement in there.\n\n401\n00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:44.510\nYou can do ands as well but\nbe careful with the ors and the ands.\n\n402\n00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.660\nThink about your logic.\n\n403\n00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.700\nI see people doing this all the time.\n\n404\n00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.516\nI wanna see traffic that's\ngoing from 10.157 and\n\n405\n00:20:52.516 --> 00:20:56.397\nI wanna see traffic\nthat's going to 10.157.\n\n406\n00:20:56.397 --> 00:20:59.240\nMakes sense,\nthat's what I wanna see, right?\n\n407\n00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.800\nI hit Enter, I've got no traffic at all.\n\n408\n00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:06.380\nAnd we know that there's traffic from that\nmachine, why am I not seeing anything?\n\n409\n00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.960\nBecause you're saying in one packet,\nboth the source and\n\n410\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.920\nthe destination has to be 10.157.\n\n411\n00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.750\nThere's no traffic that\nwent from 157 to 157.\n\n412\n00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.840\nSo an and in this case, even though in\nyour mind you think I wanna see this and\n\n413\n00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.630\nI wanna see this, that's not the way\nyou're gonna write the rule, the filter.\n\n414\n00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:29.310\nThis has to be, I wanna see if\nit satisfies this condition or\n\n415\n00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.740\nif it satisfies this condition.\n\n416\n00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.680\nOrs mean either side of the condition\nhas to be true in order to log that\n\n417\n00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.400\npocket, all right?\n\n418\n00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.440\nI what some other ones we can do,\nyou can do knots.\n\n419\n00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.463\nLet's say we wanna see,\nlet's get rid with some of these.\n\n420\n00:21:44.463 --> 00:21:50.326\nAnd we'll take out one of these equals,\n\n421\n00:21:50.326 --> 00:21:57.057\nsee IP.src !=10010157, right?\n\n422\n00:21:57.057 --> 00:22:02.458\nAnd so now if I look at this source\ncolumn, none of these will be 10.157.\n\n423\n00:22:02.458 --> 00:22:08.194\nBecause the exclamation point equals\nthe same thing as saying not, all right?\n\n424\n00:22:08.194 --> 00:22:13.610\nNotice the filter's actually yellow\nwhen I change that to a not,\n\n425\n00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:20.822\nit's green when I change that to an equal,\nit's red when my filter's not gonna work.\n\n426\n00:22:20.822 --> 00:22:21.334\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:22:21.334 --> 00:22:22.564\n&gt;&gt; So when you see the red you're\n\n428\n00:22:22.564 --> 00:22:25.900\nlike okay, something is wrong in my\nsyntax, let me take a look at that.\n\n429\n00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.780\n&gt;&gt; Which is kind of annoying\nbecause you're typing it and\n\n430\n00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.130\nyou're not finished yet\nand it's turning red.\n\n431\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.390\nIt's like it's yelling at you,\nI'm not done!\n\n432\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.100\nLet me at least put the thing in\nbefore you tell me it's wrong [LAUGH].\n\n433\n00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.840\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you said that.\n\n434\n00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.200\nI thought I might be the only one\nthat felt like I was being chested,\n\n435\n00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.915\nlike I'm not finished yet,\nI can't type that fast.\n\n436\n00:22:41.915 --> 00:22:42.942\nCheck in when I say Enter.\n\n437\n00:22:42.942 --> 00:22:46.465\nAll right, so good, good,\ngood with the source, the destination and\n\n438\n00:22:46.465 --> 00:22:49.773\nwe took a look at the dots and\nwe talk about ands, we talk about ors.\n\n439\n00:22:49.773 --> 00:22:54.850\nAnother way to do AND's is\nwith the ampersand ampersand.\n\n440\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:23:00.594\nSo I could say something like IP.addr.\n\n441\n00:23:00.594 --> 00:23:02.231\nWhat's another address out there?\n\n442\n00:23:02.231 --> 00:23:07.711\n10.140, so we could do something\n\n443\n00:23:07.711 --> 00:23:13.195\nlike this ==10.0.10.140\n\n444\n00:23:13.195 --> 00:23:18.678\n&amp;&amp; IP.addr==10.0.10.,\n\n445\n00:23:18.678 --> 00:23:23.270\nwhat was it, 147 I think?\n\n446\n00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.119\nSomething like that, all right?\n\n447\n00:23:26.119 --> 00:23:31.460\nAnd here you can see that's\nnot gonna work again because,\n\n448\n00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.849\nactually what did I do with that one?\n\n449\n00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.260\nWhat I'm saying here is this would be\na conversation between these two machines.\n\n450\n00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.600\nI'm saying that either the source or\nthe destination has to be 140 or\n\n451\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.620\nthe source and destination is 147.\n\n452\n00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.330\nSo this would be a way to filter down.\n\n453\n00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.540\nLet's say I wanna look at,\nlet me show you a better example.\n\n454\n00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.160\nLet's clear that out.\n\n455\n00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.825\nI'll show you one that actually exists.\n\n456\n00:23:51.825 --> 00:24:00.235\nSo let me find something other\nthan broadcast fun stuff.\n\n457\n00:24:00.235 --> 00:24:04.757\nLet's see, well, lots of broadcast\ntraffic going on on our network here.\n\n458\n00:24:07.856 --> 00:24:09.621\nLet me find.\n\n459\n00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:11.265\n&gt;&gt; This is where you get to scroll and\nlook for the color.\n\n460\n00:24:11.265 --> 00:24:12.708\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n461\n00:24:12.708 --> 00:24:18.416\nLet's find some green down here.\n\n462\n00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:22.940\nThere's actually one between,\nlooks like Google's DNS server and\n\n463\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.289\none of the nodes on my network here.\n\n464\n00:24:25.289 --> 00:24:27.314\nSo that'd be a good one,\nlet's do that one.\n\n465\n00:24:27.314 --> 00:24:32.950\nLet's do ip.addr==\n\n466\n00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:41.972\n8.8.8.8&amp;&amp; ip.addr = =.\n\n467\n00:24:41.972 --> 00:24:42.506\nAnd what is that?\n\n468\n00:24:42.506 --> 00:24:46.931\n10.0.10.186, 10.0.10.186.\n\n469\n00:24:46.931 --> 00:24:47.976\nAll right, and so\n\n470\n00:24:47.976 --> 00:24:52.250\nnow I'm seeing just traffic that's\ngoing between those two nodes.\n\n471\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.170\nDoesn't matter which one's the source,\nwhich one's the destination, all right?\n\n472\n00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.800\nI'm just seeing that traffic, all traffic.\n\n473\n00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.694\nNow another cool thing,\nthis could be several conversations.\n\n474\n00:25:00.694 --> 00:25:04.410\nIt might have been somebody doing\na DNS query, and then later on,\n\n475\n00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:08.278\nthey did another DNS query, just happens\nto be in the same capture file, right?\n\n476\n00:25:08.278 --> 00:25:10.980\nThere's also a way that you\ncan follow conversations,\n\n477\n00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.630\nwhich is another really good one to know.\n\n478\n00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:14.380\nLet's do this.\n\n479\n00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.677\nLet's filter down to, actually,\nlet's talk about this before I do it, and\n\n480\n00:25:17.677 --> 00:25:19.680\nthen I'll show you the follow up.\n\n481\n00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.680\nAnother filter, we've seen the IP address'\nsource destination, the nots, the ands,\n\n482\n00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.130\nthe ors, protocols is another big one.\n\n483\n00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.906\nRemember, Wireshark is\nalso a protocol analyzer,\n\n484\n00:25:29.906 --> 00:25:34.420\nit lets me look at the different\nprotocols that are going on my network.\n\n485\n00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.700\nSo if I wanna see a particular protocol,\nI just type the protocol in.\n\n486\n00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.329\nUp there in the top, you'll see\nI typed TCP, and I'll hit Enter.\n\n487\n00:25:41.329 --> 00:25:45.272\nAnd so now the only packets I'm\ngonna see are TCP packets, or\n\n488\n00:25:45.272 --> 00:25:47.680\nTCP-related packets, all right.\n\n489\n00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:53.220\nIf I wanna see ICMP,\njust type in the protocol.\n\n490\n00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.520\nAnd doesn't look like I had any\npings in that particular capture.\n\n491\n00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.280\nARP, I know there's a lot of those, right,\nso there, I'm seeing just the ARPs.\n\n492\n00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.600\nSo you see how easy it is to filter for\na particular protocol.\n\n493\n00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.160\nYou can also do your ands and ors.\n\n494\n00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:15.440\nYou can say I wanna see all HTTP\ntraffic or DNS traffic, all right?\n\n495\n00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:22.940\nSo now in my list, all I'm gonna\nsee are DNS and HTTP packets.\n\n496\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.771\nYou wouldn't wanna do an and in this case.\n\n497\n00:26:27.637 --> 00:26:33.070\nBecause there's not gonna be a packet\nthat's both HTTP and DNS, right?\n\n498\n00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:37.457\nSo again, think in your brain,\nI'm not telling it what I wanna see, HTTP,\n\n499\n00:26:37.457 --> 00:26:38.909\nI can't say it that way.\n\n500\n00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:39.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna\n\n501\n00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.780\ntell it the way we think it.\n\n502\n00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.720\nYou don't wanna say,\nI wanna see HTTP and DNS.\n\n503\n00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:51.480\nYou wanna say, I wanna see it whether\nit's HTTP or whether it's DNS.\n\n504\n00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.330\nJust a different way to verbalize\nit will help you write your\n\n505\n00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.010\nfilters here, all right.\n\n506\n00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.370\nYou can do nots with these.\n\n507\n00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.190\nI don't wanna see any,\nlet's clear this filter.\n\n508\n00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.330\nAnd I know if you had a bunch of ARPs,\nand I've also got, there's probably some,\n\n509\n00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.790\nthere's that name queries there,\nNetBIOS name server queries.\n\n510\n00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.160\nSo let's get rid of those.\n\n511\n00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:18.820\nSo what if I wanna not see ARP or\nNetBIOS name server traffic?\n\n512\n00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.740\nWell, I'm gonna use my exclamation point.\n\n513\n00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:26.227\nJust like we did before,\nbut then in parentheses,\n\n514\n00:27:26.227 --> 00:27:30.438\nup at ARP or NetBIOS name service NBNS,\n\n515\n00:27:30.438 --> 00:27:34.850\nclose my parentheses, hit Enter.\n\n516\n00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:38.430\nAnd now I'll see everything but ARP and\n\n517\n00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:42.850\nNetBIOS name server traffic, all right?\n\n518\n00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:43.440\nWhat else, Daniel?\n\n519\n00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.390\nI know we're getting short on time.\n\n520\n00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:45.830\nWe can do ports.\n\n521\n00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.406\nLet's say I want to filter for\na particular port.\n\n522\n00:27:49.406 --> 00:27:57.991\nWe could do TCP.port==80.\n\n523\n00:27:57.991 --> 00:28:02.137\nAll right, so there's your TCP\ntraffic that's going to port 80.\n\n524\n00:28:02.137 --> 00:28:05.790\nOr maybe I wanna see if\nthere's any HTTPS going on.\n\n525\n00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.840\nLet's look at port 443.\n\n526\n00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:14.050\nAnd I can see those packets,\nthose TCP.port==, and then your protocol.\n\n527\n00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:16.205\nAnother great one to do is flags.\n\n528\n00:28:16.205 --> 00:28:21.334\nTCP.flags.reset=1, oops, and\n\n529\n00:28:21.334 --> 00:28:28.224\nthat is not right because\nI forgot an equals there,\n\n530\n00:28:28.224 --> 00:28:33.849\nlet's put an ==, == 1, all right?\n\n531\n00:28:33.849 --> 00:28:37.671\nSo all of these packets,\nif we take a look at TCP down here and\n\n532\n00:28:37.671 --> 00:28:42.100\nwe expand out flags,\nnotice that the reset flag is set, right?\n\n533\n00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.580\nThere's a value of 1 there.\n\n534\n00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.752\nSo any of these flags, if I'm looking for\nsend flags or if I'm looking for\n\n535\n00:28:47.752 --> 00:28:49.922\nacknowledgements, let's do that.\n\n536\n00:28:49.922 --> 00:28:58.274\nLet's change this up to TCP.flag.send==1,\nall right?\n\n537\n00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:05.910\nSo there, all of these packets that send\nflag is gonna be set to a 1, all right?\n\n538\n00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.783\nWe could do nots with those as well.\n\n539\n00:29:07.783 --> 00:29:10.370\nI wanna see all packets where the send\nflag is not turned on, all right?\n\n540\n00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.070\nAnything else I wanna do?\n\n541\n00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.770\nYeah, there's another cool one.\n\n542\n00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:19.900\nIt is going to be actually looking\nin the packets themselves.\n\n543\n00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.590\nTCP contains autozone,\n\n544\n00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.270\nremember I went to autozone website\nhere just a little bit ago?\n\n545\n00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.170\nSo let's see what this pulls up.\n\n546\n00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.402\nSure enough, I have packets, and\nif we look at these packets,\n\n547\n00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:39.549\nDown here in our data dump,\nwe should see that every one of these\n\n548\n00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:42.972\npackets has somewhere in it,\nthere it is, ww.\n\n549\n00:29:42.972 --> 00:29:45.300\nI can't highlight just that part,\nlet's see if I can find it.\n\n550\n00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:48.981\n&gt;&gt; You could just follow the TCP string-\n&gt;&gt; I'm locking up here-\n\n551\n00:29:48.981 --> 00:29:50.560\n&gt;&gt; And that'll show the conversation.\n\n552\n00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.878\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n553\n00:29:51.878 --> 00:29:53.054\nYeah, wait, I forgot to show-\n&gt;&gt; You didn't even say that.\n\n554\n00:29:53.054 --> 00:29:53.693\n&gt;&gt; That option.\n\n555\n00:29:53.693 --> 00:29:55.395\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was talking about that option,\n\n556\n00:29:55.395 --> 00:29:56.610\nI forgot to show you.\n\n557\n00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.410\nSo there you can see the word autozone, so\n\n558\n00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.550\neach one of those packets is\ngonna have that in there.\n\n559\n00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:05.460\nSo if you're looking for data exfiltration\nand you're looking to see if anybody\n\n560\n00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.356\nis sending out data or moving files\naround that have SSN in it, or\n\n561\n00:30:09.356 --> 00:30:12.048\ncredit card numbers, or things like that.\n\n562\n00:30:12.048 --> 00:30:16.312\nYou can write filters that will look in\nall those packets, and they'll flag it if\n\n563\n00:30:16.312 --> 00:30:20.560\nit contains the word SSN or some type\nof string within the data packet.\n\n564\n00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.580\nNow really cool thing that I was gonna\nmention and Daniel reminded of this.\n\n565\n00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.545\nFollow TCP stream, really great option\nhere cuz what that'll do is, all right,\n\n566\n00:30:28.545 --> 00:30:30.154\nI'm gonna take that packet, and\n\n567\n00:30:30.154 --> 00:30:33.438\nnow I'm gonna show you the entire\nconversation between those two.\n\n568\n00:30:33.438 --> 00:30:37.350\nCuz remember, when you're doing packet\ncaptures like this, it's not like it's let\n\n569\n00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.420\nme listen to Daniel's conversation and\nwrite those packets down.\n\n570\n00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.250\nNow let me listen to Wes' conversation and\nwrite those packets down.\n\n571\n00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:44.790\nThese packets are all\ncoming in at the same time.\n\n572\n00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:46.755\nSome are Daniel's,\nsome are Wes's conversations,\n\n573\n00:30:46.755 --> 00:30:50.160\nsome of anybody else's that's on\nthe network, and they're all interspersed.\n\n574\n00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.141\nAnd so sometimes,\ntrying to figure out what the next\n\n575\n00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:56.679\npacket was in a conversation,\nit might be 30 packets down.\n\n576\n00:30:56.679 --> 00:30:58.806\nBecause there's a lot of broadcast,\nand ARP, and\n\n577\n00:30:58.806 --> 00:31:00.880\nother things going on in between there.\n\n578\n00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.270\nSo being able to pick a single packet,\nright-click,\n\n579\n00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:06.560\nand follow TCP stream,\nnow I'm seeing just that conversation.\n\n580\n00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.850\nHere's my original HTTP get request.\n\n581\n00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:12.030\nHere, I can see it going out.\n\n582\n00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.252\nThat is some encrypted garbly goop there.\n\n583\n00:31:17.192 --> 00:31:19.060\nAnd looks like most of that was.\n\n584\n00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:23.089\nAnd here's my post,\nhere is the autozone web page coming back.\n\n585\n00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.150\nIt looks like it was chunked up, and\nthis is actually a part of the, I think,\n\n586\n00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:29.740\nthe web page being sent back.\n\n587\n00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.770\nI am not the HTTP guru, but\nthat's a great little option.\n\n588\n00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:36.050\nSo if you see a packet and\nyou're interested, hey,\n\n589\n00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.855\nwhat does this packet belong to?\n\n590\n00:31:37.855 --> 00:31:40.830\nRight-click, follow TCP stream,\nand it'll show you\n\n591\n00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.873\nall the packets that are associated\nwith that particular conversation.\n\n592\n00:31:43.873 --> 00:31:47.260\nSo a lot of cool things that you\ncan do with Wireshark, and again,\n\n593\n00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.844\nit's not that I'm really trying to\nteach you Wireshark in general.\n\n594\n00:31:50.844 --> 00:31:56.109\nWe do have some great shows in our library\nfor that, but I wanna show you what\n\n595\n00:31:56.109 --> 00:32:02.050\na packet capture utility, what a protocol\nor packet analyzer is all about.\n\n596\n00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:03.076\n&gt;&gt; That's right and\n\n597\n00:32:03.076 --> 00:32:06.500\nWireshark is definitely one of\nthe kings of that very hill.\n\n598\n00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:11.460\nAnd having your brain wrapped around how\nto at least in some way use that thing\n\n599\n00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.190\nto be able to troubleshoot problems.\n\n600\n00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:17.000\nIt's great for things like DHCP\nissues that are happening, right?\n\n601\n00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.400\nI can actually look at the DORA process\nas it happens, using Wireshark and\n\n602\n00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.670\nsay, look, the O in DORA is not happening.\n\n603\n00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.620\nThere's my problem.\n\n604\n00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.780\nI need to go check a look at my server.\n\n605\n00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.160\nI need to take a look at my client.\n\n606\n00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.450\nIt's leading me into the right direction.\n\n607\n00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:36.350\nFTP, SSH, you name it, whatever\nyou're using, HTTP, you can make sure\n\n608\n00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.210\nthose conversations are happening\ncorrectly as they're supposed to be.\n\n609\n00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.150\nAnd then if you just want to\ntake a look at what's happening\n\n610\n00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.275\non your network at any point in time,\nWireshark's there for you as well.\n\n611\n00:32:45.275 --> 00:32:46.920\nA lot of great stuff with Wireshark,\n\n612\n00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:51.020\nit is a plethora of information\nwhen it comes to your network.\n\n613\n00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.660\nThat being said, Mike, thank you so much\nfor getting our feet wet with Wireshark.\n\n614\n00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.050\nWe now have some foundational knowledge\non how to use it and how to implement it.\n\n615\n00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.590\nWe do thank you guys for watching,\nbut our time has well expired.\n\n616\n00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.087\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n617\n00:33:04.087 --> 00:33:05.710\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n618\n00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:06.460\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n619\n00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.862\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n620\n00:33:08.862 --> 00:33:14.911\n[MUSIC]\n\n621\n00:33:14.911 --> 00:33:18.066\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.388\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.388 --> 00:00:11.417\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.417 --> 00:00:12.181\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n6\n00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:17.260\ngreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.840\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.780\nin today's episode we are back\nwith more In our CSA+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.000\nAnd of course,\nlike a day without sunshine,\n\n10\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.520\nwhat would it be if we didn't have Mr.\nMike Rodrick back in the studio?\n\n11\n00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.391\nMike, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:33.176\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm doing great Daniel,\nthanks for having me back and\n\n13\n00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:34.656\ncalling me sunshine, I think.\n\n14\n00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:35.909\n&gt;&gt; Brighten our day, Mike.\n\n15\n00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:36.465\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n16\n00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:38.325\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyway yes,\n\n17\n00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:41.040\nwe are here to continue on as Daniel said.\n\n18\n00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.170\nIn this episode we're gonna\nbe looking at scanners.\n\n19\n00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.250\nAnd we've talked through several\nepisodes of what a scanner does.\n\n20\n00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.480\nWe're talking about\nthe ability to scan a network.\n\n21\n00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.710\nMaybe we're looking for endpoints or\n\n22\n00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.290\ndevices, see which devices are up and\nresponding.\n\n23\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.660\nNow we can also use these scanners\nto scan for ports on a machine,\n\n24\n00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.330\nsee what ports are open.\n\n25\n00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.620\nYou think well whoop de do what\nare you gonna do with that?\n\n26\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.990\nWell you do a lot with that right as\nwe've seen throughout these episodes.\n\n27\n00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.580\nBased on the ports that are open, I can\nstart fingerprinting the operating system.\n\n28\n00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.810\nI can fingerprint the services that\nthe operating system or node is running.\n\n29\n00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.130\nAnd each one of those ports that opens\nis a possible vector into that machine.\n\n30\n00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.846\nBecause some services listening on that\nboard are waiting to respond to requests.\n\n31\n00:01:27.846 --> 00:01:31.054\nAnd that's a chance for\nme to try to take advantage of that.\n\n32\n00:01:31.054 --> 00:01:34.510\nAnd it's important that we,\nas the good guys, the white hats,\n\n33\n00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.200\nto know what services\nare running on our network.\n\n34\n00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.097\nWhat services are running on\nindividual nodes, looking for\n\n35\n00:01:40.097 --> 00:01:42.400\nservices that shouldn't be there.\n\n36\n00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.770\nLooking for\nopen ports that should not be open,\n\n37\n00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.070\nmaking sure we are securing all that.\n\n38\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.490\nSo let's take a look,\n\n39\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.180\nthe one I'm gonna use is another\none of those de facto standards.\n\n40\n00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.630\nLike we looked at wire shark which is one\nthat just about everybody has worked with\n\n41\n00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.310\nin this field when it comes\nto capturing packets.\n\n42\n00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.110\nThis one, we're gonna use EndMap\nbecause it is the tool of choice,\n\n43\n00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.540\nthe Swiss army knife,\nif you will, of scanners.\n\n44\n00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.000\nIt will do a lot, a very,\nvery powerful tool.\n\n45\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.550\nSo what we're gonna do here again, we're\nnot trying to learn any particular tool,\n\n46\n00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.640\none over the other,\none's better than the other.\n\n47\n00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.020\nWe're just talking in general, what we\ncan do, what we can see with a scanner.\n\n48\n00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.747\nAnd at the same time,\nwe'll learn a little bit about nmap but\n\n49\n00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:28.791\nother scanners are gonna\nwork very similar.\n\n50\n00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:33.204\nWhen we talk about a scanner we\nneed to know what kind of scans\n\n51\n00:02:33.204 --> 00:02:37.550\nthe scanner is capable of doing and\nhow it needs the input.\n\n52\n00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.530\nIt needs some kind of instruction,\nwhat is it you want me to scan?\n\n53\n00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.850\nAn entire network, a subnet, just a range\nof IP addresses, an individual host.\n\n54\n00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.180\nAre we doing just to see if it's up,\ndo we wanna check ports?\n\n55\n00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.020\nDo we wanna try to guess\nthe operating system?\n\n56\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.090\nDo we wanna do banner\ngrabbing on those ports?\n\n57\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.990\nWe can even use scanners to do,\nlike nmap for\n\n58\n00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.580\nexample will do vulnerability scanning.\n\n59\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.330\nNmap is, as I said,\nis just an incredibly powerful tool\n\n60\n00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.640\nhas its own scripting language,\nthe Nmap Scripting Engine.\n\n61\n00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.650\nSo you can write scripts for this,\nthey can automate a lot of these scans,\n\n62\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.720\nlike I said,\nvulnerability scanning with it, as well.\n\n63\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.220\nSo let's dive right in and\ntake a look at what we can do with Nmap.\n\n64\n00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.000\nFirst thing,\nNmap is installed on this system.\n\n65\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.630\nIf I, oops, that's not how you spell Nmap,\nit is Nmap.\n\n66\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.900\nIf I type in Nmap,\nwe'll see some help associated with it and\n\n67\n00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.659\nthere's a lot of help.\n\n68\n00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.380\nSome of the things that\nwe really wanna focus on.\n\n69\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.500\nSome of the switches up here\nlike target specification.\n\n70\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.810\nYou can do it either by host name or\nIP address,\n\n71\n00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.710\nor CIDR notation for a network.\n\n72\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.650\nYou can also use a list\nwhich is extremely handy and\n\n73\n00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.330\nI'm gonna show you how to use that.\n\n74\n00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.840\nHere in just a minute but\nit's just a text file with the networks,\n\n75\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.260\nthe targets, that you want to scan.\n\n76\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.980\nAnd that could be one subnet on each line.\n\n77\n00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.780\nIt could be an unusual host on each line.\n\n78\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.560\nI've never used the random target option.\n\n79\n00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.630\nYou can also do excludes and then for host\ndiscovery, do we wanna do a ping sweep?\n\n80\n00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.870\nDo we wanna start doing TCP connect scans?\n\n81\n00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.085\nSo we've got scan techniques down here.\n\n82\n00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:23.330\nYou can see the different switches.\n\n83\n00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:30.150\nKeep in mind with Nmap switches are case\nsensitive, most Linux systems are.\n\n84\n00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.080\nSo a capital H versus a little H is gonna\nmake a difference in what you're doing, so\n\n85\n00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.890\nmake sure you're paying attention to that.\n\n86\n00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.160\nThere's lot of great Nmap cheat\nsheets that you can go out there and\n\n87\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.730\nget, as well, to help you with this.\n\n88\n00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.960\nBut they have really good help,\nthey've got great documentation.\n\n89\n00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.500\nIf you go to nmap.org, they have\nfantastic documentation out there.\n\n90\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.010\nOS detection, so\n\n91\n00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.340\nagain some of the important ones we'll\ntake a look at As we go through here.\n\n92\n00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.670\nSo let's clear this up and\nlet's see what we can do.\n\n93\n00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.250\nSo basic scan, just gonna type in nmap and\nI'm gonna type in my target.\n\n94\n00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.410\nNow that is not my target IP address.\n\n95\n00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.459\n&gt;&gt; It's an interesting IP\naddress you have there, Mike.\n\n96\n00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:13.065\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we're doing a quantum IP address.\n\n97\n00:05:13.065 --> 00:05:14.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n98\n00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.210\n&gt;&gt; Let's get rid of that and\ncheck that Num Lock and try that again.\n\n99\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.285\nThat looks a little more IP friendly so,\n0.100.200, for example.\n\n100\n00:05:25.285 --> 00:05:28.705\nAnd I'm not gonna actually run\nthrough all these scans otherwise,\n\n101\n00:05:28.705 --> 00:05:32.429\nwe'll just be spending a lot of this\nepisode waiting for scans to finish.\n\n102\n00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:35.418\nI'll let a couple of them finish,\nwe'll get the idea and\n\n103\n00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:39.090\nthen we'll just start showing\nyou the commands and moving on.\n\n104\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.160\nSo let this run for a minute, but\n\n105\n00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.880\nthis is just a basic default scan\nof that particular IP address.\n\n106\n00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.710\nYou see it didn't take very long.\n\n107\n00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.900\nIt tells me that the host is up and\n\n108\n00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.770\nI can see the ports that\nare open on that machine.\n\n109\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.040\nAs well as what it thinks the service\nis that is on those particular ports.\n\n110\n00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.350\nSo again just a basic scan,\n\n111\n00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.590\ntook about 15 a little over,\n15 seconds there to accomplish.\n\n112\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.076\nIf I want to do a range of nodes,\nI can just simply do a- and\n\n113\n00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:12.976\nwe could do a run of 201 is up.\n\n114\n00:06:12.976 --> 00:06:16.280\nI won't actually run this one,\nbecause it's gonna be the same results,\n\n115\n00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.623\njust more than one computer.\n\n116\n00:06:17.623 --> 00:06:22.946\nBut you can see all it did\nwas 10.0.100.200 -201.\n\n117\n00:06:22.946 --> 00:06:25.123\nSo it's gonna understand that yeah,\n\n118\n00:06:25.123 --> 00:06:28.140\nthat lost octet's gonna\nbe a range of addresses.\n\n119\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.149\nYou could do it sooner than that, it\ndoesn't have to be just the last octave.\n\n120\n00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:37.026\nMaybe I'm doing 10.0.100.0 0-101.255,\n\n121\n00:06:37.026 --> 00:06:42.090\nright, to scan a bigger\nrange of IP addresses there.\n\n122\n00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.960\n&gt;&gt; Now Nmap will tell you\nthat the 201 machine is down.\n\n123\n00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.730\nIt'll say the host was not up or whatever.\n\n124\n00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.030\nThere will be a little output for that,\n\n125\n00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.760\nbut as far as actually finding things\n[INAUDIBLE] it's the exact same.\n\n126\n00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, let's see what else.\n\n127\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.090\nI can do a CIDR notation,\nI don't know the host yet.\n\n128\n00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.494\nOr I'll want to scan the entire subject\nI can just do it dot zero slash 24.\n\n129\n00:07:02.494 --> 00:07:06.480\nGo out and scan all of those addresses.\n\n130\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.970\nIt will go through each one,\nkeep that in mind.\n\n131\n00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.770\nIf I do slash 24, that's what 256?\n\n132\n00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.780\nPossible addresses there,\n254 possible addresses there.\n\n133\n00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.190\nSo it will scan each one, it'll do a\nlittle ping test to see if the host is up.\n\n134\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.060\nIf it's not, it's gonna move on.\n\n135\n00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:28.480\nBut it will go through all 254 or 256,\nreally, of those possible IP addresses.\n\n136\n00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.650\nSo it'll take it a little longer to do,\nespecially if you've got\n\n137\n00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.000\n100 of those addresses are actually up and\nrunning nodes.\n\n138\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.350\nSo it is helpful to\nnarrow your scope down,\n\n139\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.710\nespecially when you starting getting\ninto the more in-depth scans.\n\n140\n00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.820\nAnd I'll show you a little\ntechnique that I use and\n\n141\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.080\na lot of people use with first\nlet's determine which hosts are up.\n\n142\n00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.771\nLet's build a list based off of that then\nwe'll use that list as the input for\n\n143\n00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:54.325\nour more in depth scans.\n\n144\n00:07:54.325 --> 00:07:57.215\nSo I'm not wasting time,\nnetwork bandwidth,\n\n145\n00:07:57.215 --> 00:07:59.538\ndoing scans of hosts that aren't up.\n\n146\n00:07:59.538 --> 00:08:02.005\nAnd hosts that I don't\nreally need to know about.\n\n147\n00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:06.020\nAll right, so\nthat's how you do a network scan.\n\n148\n00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.100\nIn fact, let's go ahead and do this.\n\n149\n00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.750\nLet's change this up a little bit.\n\n150\n00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.380\nLet's start up at the top so you guys\ncan see exactly what I'm doing here.\n\n151\n00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:21.500\nAnd what I want to do is I want to\ncreate a file that I can use as input.\n\n152\n00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.680\nIP addresses, live hosts that\nI can do deeper scans with.\n\n153\n00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:31.700\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto run nmap against that entire subnet.\n\n154\n00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.740\nAnd we could do it a couple\nof different ways.\n\n155\n00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.710\nI could do a -sP, do a ping sweep.\n\n156\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:42.750\nI can just do the default scan,\nbut I'm gonna do\n\n157\n00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:48.420\nto a -sP just to do a ping\nsweep of that network range,\n\n158\n00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.200\nso 10.0.100.0/24.\n\n159\n00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.301\n&gt;&gt; Mike's going old school.\n\n160\n00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:55.332\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n161\n00:08:55.332 --> 00:08:56.283\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you know they changed it, right?\n\n162\n00:08:56.283 --> 00:08:58.160\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n163\n00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.178\n&gt;&gt; The ping sweep is now sn lowercase.\n\n164\n00:09:01.178 --> 00:09:02.920\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; But sP still works, but\n\n165\n00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.595\nthey're depreciating it.\n\n166\n00:09:04.595 --> 00:09:05.626\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good call.\n\n167\n00:09:05.626 --> 00:09:06.155\n&gt;&gt; Keep that in mind.\n\n168\n00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:08.440\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you pay attention to that,\nright.\n\n169\n00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.190\nThat one will disappear before long.\n\n170\n00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.600\nAnd then what I wanna do\nis I wanna do output.\n\n171\n00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.710\nAnother switch we need to\nbe familiar with is the -o.\n\n172\n00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.840\nNMAP can output in different formats.\n\n173\n00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:28.000\nWe can do a grep-able format, we can do\njust a plain text file, we can do XML.\n\n174\n00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.840\nYou can actually do a -oA to\noutput all formats, right?\n\n175\n00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:39.310\nIn this case, I just want a grep-able\noutput, right, so I'm gonna do a -oG.\n\n176\n00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.500\n&gt;&gt; The original gangster, right [LAUGH]?\n\n177\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.540\n&gt;&gt; The original gangster, that's it.\n\n178\n00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.171\nAnd I'm gonna call this one,\n\n179\n00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:50.549\nwe're gonna output that to live-hosts.txt,\nall right.\n\n180\n00:09:50.549 --> 00:09:56.260\nAnd we'll go ahead and hit Enter for that,\nand we let this run for just a second.\n\n181\n00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.120\nWhat was I gonna, there was something\nwhile that was running I was actually\n\n182\n00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.670\ngonna talk about and\nnow it's slipped my mind.\n\n183\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.220\nSo this is just gonna, again, a general\nping sweep of that entire network range.\n\n184\n00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:14.190\nAnd it's gonna list the IP addresses that\nare up, the ones that actually respond.\n\n185\n00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.420\nSo let this finish, there's no that many\non there, so this won't take very long.\n\n186\n00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.275\nThere's just about four or five on there.\n\n187\n00:10:20.275 --> 00:10:27.020\nAnd then I'm doing with the -oG grep-able,\nI could have left that text off of there.\n\n188\n00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.780\nObviously with Linux everything's a file,\nright?\n\n189\n00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.620\nBut if you were doing the XML ox,\n\n190\n00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.640\nyou'd want to make it .xml\nprobably as your extension.\n\n191\n00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.307\nIf you do the -oA, just give it a name and\n\n192\n00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:45.653\ndon't put an extension on there cuz you\ncan't specify individual extensions.\n\n193\n00:10:45.653 --> 00:10:47.650\nBut you can always go back later and\nadd those.\n\n194\n00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.233\nAll right, so there we go, it's done,\n\n195\n00:10:49.233 --> 00:10:51.244\nit took it 28 seconds to\nfind all of my live hosts.\n\n196\n00:10:51.244 --> 00:10:54.478\nNow if I look at that file,\n\n197\n00:10:54.478 --> 00:10:58.920\nlet's do a cat live-hosts.txt.\n\n198\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.560\nAnd I can see okay, nice,\nIt shows me the scan.\n\n199\n00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.790\nIt actually gives me the command that\nI ran which is great, love that.\n\n200\n00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.510\nAnd if we're gonna talk\nabout documentation and\n\n201\n00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:15.540\nreporting, I don't remember\nthe exact switches I used, shoot!\n\n202\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.890\nWell here it is right there documented for\nme.\n\n203\n00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:22.040\nShows me the IP addresses and\nthe fact that these are up, right?\n\n204\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.980\nAnd then a little line down there shows\nme the total overall scan and duration.\n\n205\n00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.920\nWhich is great, but\nthis won't work very well as an input\n\n206\n00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.950\nlist because it's got all\nthis other information.\n\n207\n00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.220\nRemember, my input list really needs\nto be just a list of IP addresses,\n\n208\n00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.580\none on each line.\n\n209\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.590\nThat's where we're going\nto use our grep feature.\n\n210\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.800\nSo we're gonna do a little grep and\nwe're gonna look for the word up.\n\n211\n00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.760\nSo only the lines that\nhave the word up in there,\n\n212\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.100\ndo keep in mind that is case sensitive.\n\n213\n00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.580\nAnd then the file name is\ngonna be live-hosts.txt And\n\n214\n00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.640\nwe're gonna pipe this out into\na cut command, all right.\n\n215\n00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.990\nAnd we're gonna cut based on my delimiter,\n-d, is gonna be a blank space.\n\n216\n00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.050\nCuz I can see there's a space right here.\n\n217\n00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.260\nAnd then after that column,\nthere's a space right there.\n\n218\n00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.150\nSo I'm gonna use the space\nas my delimiter.\n\n219\n00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.146\nThat's gonna divide the file\nup into what we call fields.\n\n220\n00:12:15.146 --> 00:12:20.825\nAnd then I'm gonna say -f2 because if this\nis my first field, there's my delimiter.\n\n221\n00:12:20.825 --> 00:12:23.870\nThis my second field,\nthere's my delimiter.\n\n222\n00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:24.820\nThere's my third field,\n\n223\n00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.440\nthe open close parentheses, then my\nfourth field, I want that second field.\n\n224\n00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:34.865\nSo separate it up by the spaces, and\nthen grab that second field, all right.\n\n225\n00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:38.107\nAnd then I'm gonna pipe\nthat into a sort command,\n\n226\n00:12:38.107 --> 00:12:40.660\ncuz I'm just a little weird like that.\n\n227\n00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.130\nI want it in numerical order,\nwouldn't have to,\n\n228\n00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.930\nwouldn't make a bit of difference.\n\n229\n00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:50.731\nAnd then I'm going to take that and\noutput it into targets.txt.\n\n230\n00:12:50.731 --> 00:12:54.870\nAll right, and we'll go ahead and\nrun that, should be pretty quick.\n\n231\n00:12:54.870 --> 00:13:02.320\nAnd then we'll cat that targets.txt,\nand look at that.\n\n232\n00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.300\nNow I have a nice handy\nfile that has nothing but\n\n233\n00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.210\nthe IP addresses of the live\nhosts on this particular subnet.\n\n234\n00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.560\nSo when I'm doing any kind\nof test on a network,\n\n235\n00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.610\nthat's one of the first things I do.\n\n236\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.620\nLet's determine what's out there,\nwhat's up, and then give me a little list.\n\n237\n00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nnow you've got a text list of nothing but\n\n238\n00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.660\nIP addresses in the correct order.\n\n239\n00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:27.400\nYou can use that then to input\nfrom that file into nmap and\n\n240\n00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.690\nsay just look through this list.\n\n241\n00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.360\n&gt;&gt; Let's try that, Daniel,\nlet's see what that does.\n\n242\n00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.503\nSo I'm gonna do an n map,\nwe'll even do a -A.\n\n243\n00:13:33.503 --> 00:13:36.930\nWe'll talk about it, give us a minute\nto talk about, that is a longer scan.\n\n244\n00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:42.240\nBut I'm gonna do a -A and\nthen -I for import, capital L for\n\n245\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.740\nlist, and then just my targets.txt.\n\n246\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.500\nAnd we're gonna let this run,\nall right, and we'll let that go.\n\n247\n00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.910\nSo -A, as I said,\n\n248\n00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:55.967\nthere's lots of different types of\nscans that you can do with nmap.\n\n249\n00:13:55.967 --> 00:13:58.200\nThe -A includes a few different ones.\n\n250\n00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.180\nIt's gonna do a basic port scan.\n\n251\n00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.850\nIt's also gonna do OS detection.\n\n252\n00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:08.210\nIt's also gonna throw in some banner\ngrabbing on some of those ports.\n\n253\n00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.790\nAs well as a couple scripts that are run.\n\n254\n00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.495\nSome of what we call the safe scripts,\nright?\n\n255\n00:14:14.495 --> 00:14:16.060\nNmap has a lot of scripts.\n\n256\n00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.752\nI think last time I checked, I'll show\nyou in a minute, over 500 scripts.\n\n257\n00:14:19.752 --> 00:14:21.670\nThere is a set known as the safe scripts.\n\n258\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.870\nAnd what that means is these\nare scripts that are not gonna do any\n\n259\n00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.076\nharm to the target.\n\n260\n00:14:27.076 --> 00:14:30.160\nThey shouldn't affect its resources or\nanything like that.\n\n261\n00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.420\nOther scripts you run could tie\nup resources on the target,\n\n262\n00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.310\ngenerate a lot of network traffic that's\ngoing to suck up resources there.\n\n263\n00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.400\nSo something to keep in mind.\n\n264\n00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.695\n&gt;&gt; Some of them even crash\nthe machine [LAUGH].\n\n265\n00:14:41.695 --> 00:14:43.922\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is why you don't wanna run those\n\n266\n00:14:43.922 --> 00:14:45.826\nif you're in a production environment.\n\n267\n00:14:45.826 --> 00:14:49.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would be a bad day\nif you start crashing servers.\n\n268\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.760\n&gt;&gt; Why is our Exchange server down, Mike?\n\n269\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.997\nNo reason,\nI'm just cleaning up my work area [LAUGH].\n\n270\n00:14:55.997 --> 00:14:59.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\nwe'll give this just a minute.\n\n271\n00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.610\nWhat else do I wanna talk\nabout while that is scanning?\n\n272\n00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:08.030\nPorts, once we get this up, when we get\nthis scan done and show you how you\n\n273\n00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.320\nuse this list, the other thing we\nsometimes wanna scan for is ports.\n\n274\n00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.355\nWe do a basic scan, and that's gonna\ngive us, as we saw like on DC1,\n\n275\n00:15:15.355 --> 00:15:18.095\nwe saw several ports that are open.\n\n276\n00:15:18.095 --> 00:15:19.735\nWell I might now want to go back and\n\n277\n00:15:19.735 --> 00:15:22.475\ndo a little more in-depth\nscan on one of those ports.\n\n278\n00:15:22.475 --> 00:15:26.055\nDo a little more intensive banner\ngrabbing on that, or versioning,\n\n279\n00:15:26.055 --> 00:15:28.288\ntrying to figure out what service that is.\n\n280\n00:15:28.288 --> 00:15:31.353\nCuz seeing that it's\nrunning Apache is helpful.\n\n281\n00:15:31.353 --> 00:15:37.337\nSeeing that it's run Apache version\nx.x.x.x is even more helpful.\n\n282\n00:15:37.337 --> 00:15:39.066\nBecause if I'm the bad guy,\n\n283\n00:15:39.066 --> 00:15:43.762\nI can look for vulnerabilities that I\nknow exist in that particular version.\n\n284\n00:15:43.762 --> 00:15:47.316\nOr if you're a version higher than that,\nI know, okay, move on to the next target,\n\n285\n00:15:47.316 --> 00:15:49.137\nthey're not gonna be vulnerable to this.\n\n286\n00:15:49.137 --> 00:15:52.373\nOr maybe I want to scan my network and\nsee if anybody's running a web server.\n\n287\n00:15:52.373 --> 00:15:55.477\nNobody should be running web services,\nbut Users goof up sometimes or\n\n288\n00:15:55.477 --> 00:15:59.900\nmaybe they're getting a little malicious\nand maybe they're running a web server.\n\n289\n00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.492\nI don't know about it, right?\n\n290\n00:16:01.492 --> 00:16:04.016\nHow am I gonna keep my network safe\nif I don't know what's going on?\n\n291\n00:16:04.016 --> 00:16:08.567\nSo maybe I wanna do a quick sweep of the\nentire subnet, but only look for port 80.\n\n292\n00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:11.330\nI don't need detailed information\non each one of those hosts.\n\n293\n00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.040\nIt's gotta be quick, and I can do that.\n\n294\n00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.299\nOr I've got an exploit\nthat works against FTP.\n\n295\n00:16:16.299 --> 00:16:19.528\nI need to see if any of the nodes on\nthe target system are running FTP.\n\n296\n00:16:19.528 --> 00:16:20.670\nHow do I do that?\n\n297\n00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.770\nLet's scan for port 20 and\n21 and see what's out there.\n\n298\n00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:31.930\nSo you can do -P and then the port\nnumber that you want to scan for.\n\n299\n00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.590\nSo like, -P389 for say, Active Directory.\n\n300\n00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.970\nHere we go, we've finished up so\nwe'll come back to the ports as we demo.\n\n301\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.810\nLet's take a look at the results here.\n\n302\n00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.950\nI'm gonna scroll back up.\n\n303\n00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.809\nAnd looks like we had a big whopping,\nI think, should be four.\n\n304\n00:16:48.809 --> 00:16:51.340\nI forgot how many were\nin that source list.\n\n305\n00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.920\nThere we go, there's my top.\n\n306\n00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.420\nSo here I can see,\npick that first toast 100.10, and\n\n307\n00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.940\nyou can see what open ports are on there.\n\n308\n00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.020\nIt also does the OS detection, right?\n\n309\n00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.965\nSo I can see OS scan results,\nOS guesses, it thinks, it's Windows 10.\n\n310\n00:17:07.965 --> 00:17:14.225\n95% confidence rate, but it also thinks it\nmight be Server 2008, 93% confidence rate.\n\n311\n00:17:14.225 --> 00:17:16.236\nCould be Service Pack 1, 91%.\n\n312\n00:17:16.236 --> 00:17:18.075\nThese OS detections are based on rules and\n\n313\n00:17:18.075 --> 00:17:20.420\nresponses that are coming\nfrom these ports.\n\n314\n00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.104\nBeing a Windows operating system and\nof a similar kernel,\n\n315\n00:17:23.104 --> 00:17:25.313\nthey're gonna give you\nvery similar results.\n\n316\n00:17:25.313 --> 00:17:29.990\nSo it's sometimes very difficult for it to\ntell exactly what operating system it is.\n\n317\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:34.218\nBut, I know I'm in the ballpark with\nWindows 8, Windows 10, Windows 7,\n\n318\n00:17:34.218 --> 00:17:35.643\nsomewhere around there.\n\n319\n00:17:35.643 --> 00:17:40.720\nIt shouldn't say Windows XP cuz it can\npretty much tell the difference there.\n\n320\n00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.850\nIt doesn't say Linux or Mac OS X.\n\n321\n00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:47.140\nSo I know it's a Windows and\na later version of Windows, right?\n\n322\n00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.010\nBut you can see it's also\ndoing some scripting.\n\n323\n00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.100\nLike here's SMB security mode.\n\n324\n00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.270\nThis is actually one of the Nmap\nscripts where it's probing,\n\n325\n00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:01.860\nit saw that there was ports open and\nit said, let me try this SMB script.\n\n326\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.780\nAnd see if I can get\nanything back from there.\n\n327\n00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.390\nMessage signing is disabled,\ndangerous but default, right?\n\n328\n00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.570\nThat could be helpful\nlater on in our attack.\n\n329\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.220\nOr, if we're the good guys,\nin trying to protect our system.\n\n330\n00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.030\nYou can see much more\ndetailed information, right?\n\n331\n00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.660\nActually it gives me the domain name\ninstead of just telling me it's most\n\n332\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.440\nlikely Active Directory running on 389.\n\n333\n00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.170\nI can see versions.\n\n334\n00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.470\nIt says right here,\n2016 Datacenter Evaluation, all right?\n\n335\n00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.630\nSo lots of great\ninformation from that scan.\n\n336\n00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.100\nAll right, a very good one.\n\n337\n00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:41.630\nOne of my faves to run as I'm beginning\nmy reconnaissance on a network.\n\n338\n00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.280\nCLS does not work in Linux, Mike.\n\n339\n00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:44.910\n&gt;&gt; No, it does not.\n\n340\n00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:45.930\n&gt;&gt; We were just talking about that.\n\n341\n00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.380\nI need to make an alias\ncuz I'm always using CLS.\n\n342\n00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.170\nAll right, what else?\n\n343\n00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.660\nWe're talking about ports, as I said.\n\n344\n00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:53.820\nAnd I won't run some of these.\n\n345\n00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:59.685\nI'm just gonna show you\nthe syntax -p 389 and\n\n346\n00:18:59.685 --> 00:19:06.994\nthen maybe my network\naddress 10.0.100 0/24.\n\n347\n00:19:06.994 --> 00:19:10.243\nRight, so I can look for\njust servers that are running or\n\n348\n00:19:10.243 --> 00:19:13.630\njust devices that are running\nthat port number.\n\n349\n00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:20.176\nI could also do a, well,,\nif I want to scan all 65,535 ports, right?\n\n350\n00:19:20.176 --> 00:19:23.605\nI could do a -p-.\n\n351\n00:19:23.605 --> 00:19:28.440\nIf you leave off the endpoint,\nit says all right, I'm gonna go from 0 or\n\n352\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.309\n1 to 65 or 0 to 65535, all right?\n\n353\n00:19:31.309 --> 00:19:34.826\nWe can also do one of\nmy other favorites is,\n\n354\n00:19:34.826 --> 00:19:41.210\nI have a lot of favorites when it\ncomes to Nmap, --top-ports, all right.\n\n355\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.748\nAnd then you would put your target,\nor you tell it how many top ports.\n\n356\n00:19:44.748 --> 00:19:51.544\n1,000, for example, and\nthen your target 100.200, for example.\n\n357\n00:19:51.544 --> 00:19:54.640\nAnd I'll run that real quick,\nit's not gonna take it long.\n\n358\n00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:59.212\nTop ports,\nthe people at Nmap that make Nmap,\n\n359\n00:19:59.212 --> 00:20:02.738\nhave tons of information, right?\n\n360\n00:20:02.738 --> 00:20:04.490\nThis is what their product does.\n\n361\n00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.640\nAnd they know the most\ncommon ports that are open.\n\n362\n00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.846\nAnd so basically, what they're saying\nis you can do top ports anything.\n\n363\n00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:15.796\nYou can do top-ports 10, top-ports 500.\n\n364\n00:20:15.796 --> 00:20:19.740\nAnd it'll just use the top whatever,\nsay 10,\n\n365\n00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:24.390\nmost commonly found open ports\naccording to Nmap's research.\n\n366\n00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.210\nWhat they have found is if you\ndo an Nmap top ports 1,000,\n\n367\n00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.940\nlet me to just double\ncheck my numbers here.\n\n368\n00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:37.430\n93% of open TCP ports,\n95 % of open UDP ports.\n\n369\n00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:41.410\nSo if you're telling me that I can find\n93% of the ports with only scanning 1,000\n\n370\n00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:45.710\nports rather than scanning\nall 65,535 ports?\n\n371\n00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.220\nThat's a fraction of the ports.\n\n372\n00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.210\nThat means my scans are gonna be much,\nmuch faster.\n\n373\n00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.660\nAnd I'll still find 93% of the open ports,\nthat's huge.\n\n374\n00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:58.678\nAnd if I'm doing a scan across larger\nnetworks and I've got a class B network,\n\n375\n00:20:58.678 --> 00:21:03.140\nor even a full class C network,\nthose scans can take a while.\n\n376\n00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.552\nIf I can get almost the same results,\n93% and\n\n377\n00:21:06.552 --> 00:21:10.460\nuse a fraction of the port numbers,\nthat's a great thing.\n\n378\n00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.521\n&gt;&gt; And it's so good.\n\n379\n00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:17.091\nIt's such a good and effective scan,\nthat that's what Nmap runs by default,\n\n380\n00:21:17.091 --> 00:21:18.627\nIt is the top 1,000.\n\n381\n00:21:18.627 --> 00:21:21.885\nIt says, well, it's just so dang good,\nwe'll make that the default scan.\n\n382\n00:21:21.885 --> 00:21:25.667\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, why would you not,\n\n383\n00:21:25.667 --> 00:21:26.484\nright?\n\n384\n00:21:26.484 --> 00:21:28.018\nAll right, so we've got our top ports.\n\n385\n00:21:28.018 --> 00:21:34.664\nLet's see scan types, we can do things\nlike TCP connect scans, syn scans.\n\n386\n00:21:34.664 --> 00:21:40.214\nAll of this is done with Nmap -s,\nlittle s for scan, and then type.\n\n387\n00:21:40.214 --> 00:21:43.440\nLet's do a T for TCP scans.\n\n388\n00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.250\nYou can do a -s for syn scans.\n\n389\n00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.390\nSome people try to tell you\nthis is a stealth scan.\n\n390\n00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:55.650\nIt is no longer very stealthy at all doing\nthat, everything is gonna detect that.\n\n391\n00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:57.360\nWhat else?\n\n392\n00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.620\nIf you wanna do UDP ports, do a -U.\n\n393\n00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.900\nKeep in mind UDP scans will\ntake a little bit longer.\n\n394\n00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.280\nRemember, it's a connection list protocol.\n\n395\n00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.705\n&gt;&gt; When you say a little\nbit it means a lot of bit.\n\n396\n00:22:08.705 --> 00:22:10.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It takes a long time running UDP scan.\n\n397\n00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.230\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n398\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.775\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's lengthy.\n\n399\n00:22:12.775 --> 00:22:15.189\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, so I mean, you've gotta do it,\n\n400\n00:22:15.189 --> 00:22:19.680\nright, because I need to know if one\nof my servers has a UDP port open.\n\n401\n00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.557\nBut yeah, be prepared to just\nlet that run and walk away and\n\n402\n00:22:22.557 --> 00:22:24.986\nget yourself a cup of coffee and\nmake a sandwich.\n\n403\n00:22:24.986 --> 00:22:28.399\nWhatever you gotta do,\nand then come back, right?\n\n404\n00:22:28.399 --> 00:22:29.155\nWhat else?\n\n405\n00:22:29.155 --> 00:22:31.690\nOS and service detection.\n\n406\n00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:35.160\nAs I said that -a actually includes a lot.\n\n407\n00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.250\nLet me get back up to\nthe top of my screen here.\n\n408\n00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.290\nA couple times we'll do Nmap -A,\nwe saw that.\n\n409\n00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:46.590\nThat does OS detection, the top 1000\nport scan does some banner grabbing or\n\n410\n00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.530\nservice detection.\n\n411\n00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.590\n&gt;&gt; Versioning, yep.\n\n412\n00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.790\n&gt;&gt; Versioning, yeah on the different\nports, what service versions those are.\n\n413\n00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.430\nYou can do a -SV.\n\n414\n00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:00.920\nAnd SV does versioning on the ports.\n\n415\n00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.010\nAnd that has, you can do a -SV.\n\n416\n00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:07.198\nAnd I wanna say the default\nis intensity level 5?\n\n417\n00:23:07.198 --> 00:23:08.260\nI'm not sure on that.\n\n418\n00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.896\nBut the intensity goes from 0 to 9.\n\n419\n00:23:10.896 --> 00:23:15.902\nAnd what that means is how aggressive\nis it going to hit those plots and\n\n420\n00:23:15.902 --> 00:23:18.245\ntry to bring back information?\n\n421\n00:23:18.245 --> 00:23:21.665\nAnd a lot of times what I'll do is\non my first scan I might do a -,\n\n422\n00:23:21.665 --> 00:23:23.358\nwe can do something like this.\n\n423\n00:23:23.358 --> 00:23:29.902\nWe could do a -sv --version intensity,\n\n424\n00:23:29.902 --> 00:23:34.050\nlet's spell that right.\n\n425\n00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Looks good.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n426\n00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:38.030\nyou might do a 0 and then my target.\n\n427\n00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:42.446\nAnd let's see what we can get back here,\n100.200.\n\n428\n00:23:42.446 --> 00:23:46.260\nAll right, we'll give it a second to run.\n\n429\n00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.870\nAnd intensity 0 would be very,\nvery light touch.\n\n430\n00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.291\nShouldn't take very long at all.\n\n431\n00:23:50.291 --> 00:23:55.413\nIt's not gonna do a lot but I'm also\ngonna get less information In the end.\n\n432\n00:23:55.413 --> 00:24:00.583\nHopefully this'll finish here\nwithin a reasonable amount of time.\n\n433\n00:24:00.583 --> 00:24:01.891\n&gt;&gt; If you hit Enter or\n\n434\n00:24:01.891 --> 00:24:06.740\nany key it'll tell you the estimated\ntime of completion there.\n\n435\n00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.700\n&gt;&gt; It's thinking about it, yeah.\n\n436\n00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.640\nIt's done, there we go.\n\n437\n00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go.\n\n438\n00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.510\nNow if I did, and\nI don't know if I want to do.\n\n439\n00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.631\nThat took 25 seconds.\n\n440\n00:24:15.631 --> 00:24:20.430\nIf I change this to 9-\n&gt;&gt; That should\n\n441\n00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.162\nincrease your speed I think.\n\n442\n00:24:23.162 --> 00:24:26.840\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be very [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's gonna go crazy.\n\n443\n00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.643\n&gt;&gt; It is going to really pound\neach one of those ports and\n\n444\n00:24:30.643 --> 00:24:33.674\ntry to find as much information as it can.\n\n445\n00:24:33.674 --> 00:24:36.344\nYou can also do that\nwith just normal scans.\n\n446\n00:24:36.344 --> 00:24:43.260\nYou can set the speed factor from I\nwanna say from zero to five on that one.\n\n447\n00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.920\nAnd that's when you're\ntrying to be stealthy and\n\n448\n00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.022\nyou're trying to avoid IDSs and IPSs.\n\n449\n00:24:48.022 --> 00:24:52.492\nBecause I don't know, if you just run\nNmap and you're doing a full port scan or\n\n450\n00:24:52.492 --> 00:24:54.271\neven just the top 1,000.\n\n451\n00:24:54.271 --> 00:24:58.670\nThat's gonna be detected by almost every\nIDS and IPS if they're set up properly.\n\n452\n00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.890\nThey're gonna see lots of requests\ncoming to a series of port numbers\n\n453\n00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.600\nat the same destination address.\n\n454\n00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.620\nHow often are people trying to make\nconnections to the same IP address\n\n455\n00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:12.280\nin each port number one at a time?\n\n456\n00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.870\nBut if I can slow that down a little bit,\n\n457\n00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:18.460\nif I set my timing to a zero It will\nsend out a request and then wait.\n\n458\n00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.254\nSend out the next request to\nthe next port and then wait.\n\n459\n00:25:20.254 --> 00:25:22.469\nRather than just going [SOUND].\n\n460\n00:25:22.469 --> 00:25:27.121\nAnd so what the idea is that it won't show\nup, maybe the IDSs won't pick that up\n\n461\n00:25:27.121 --> 00:25:30.240\nbecause they won't see it\nas one process like that.\n\n462\n00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.190\nThey'll go, it's just a connection,\nand a lot of other stuff happens.\n\n463\n00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.838\nAnd then there's another\nconnection that IP addresses and\n\n464\n00:25:34.838 --> 00:25:35.577\nthen a lot of stuff happens.\n\n465\n00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:37.790\nAnd so they don't see it as a port scan.\n\n466\n00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:42.500\nThat's the idea, no guarantees, right.\n\n467\n00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.060\nLet's see, that guy is still running,\nwe'll let it go for another minute.\n\n468\n00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.449\nI was talking about the outputs earlier.\n\n469\n00:25:50.449 --> 00:25:54.271\nWanted to mention, I told you\nabout little o capital X for XML.\n\n470\n00:25:54.271 --> 00:25:57.433\nLittle o capital G we saw for\nmy grippable format.\n\n471\n00:25:57.433 --> 00:26:01.920\nLittle o dash n is my Nmap.\n\n472\n00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.335\nI call it normal output,\nit's really the Nmap output.\n\n473\n00:26:04.335 --> 00:26:11.580\nLittle o dash a is gonna give me all\nthree of those outputs, all right?\n\n474\n00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:19.466\nAnd the last thing I wanna talk about\nwith you guys is going to be the scripts.\n\n475\n00:26:19.466 --> 00:26:21.266\nSo I'm hoping this will finish here.\n\n476\n00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:22.340\nI was trying to stall.\n\n477\n00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.170\nBut it's still going.\n\n478\n00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.740\nAs I mentioned toward\nthe beginning of this episode,\n\n479\n00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.940\nNmap has a great scripting\nengine built into it, the NSE.\n\n480\n00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.760\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna\nopen up another terminal window while\n\n481\n00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.894\nthat scan is running.\n\n482\n00:26:38.447 --> 00:26:40.180\nAnd we'll let that go in the background.\n\n483\n00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.300\nAnd we can take a look at some\nother stuff while it's running.\n\n484\n00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.430\nSo what I'm gonna do is take\na look at the scripts here.\n\n485\n00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:49.580\nI'm gonna do an ls -l.\n\n486\n00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:54.675\nLet's go into, if I can remember where\nthese guys are, user, Nmap, sorry, share.\n\n487\n00:26:54.675 --> 00:27:01.950\nshares/nmap/scripts.\n\n488\n00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:07.440\nAnd these are all of the scripts that\nNmap comes with, out of the box, right.\n\n489\n00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.660\nThis is not an all inclusive list,\nyou can write your own.\n\n490\n00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:11.262\nYou can go out and\n\n491\n00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:14.081\nfind communities where they've written\ntheir own scripts that you can use.\n\n492\n00:27:14.081 --> 00:27:17.566\nIt's a freely available\nlanguage that we can use, but\n\n493\n00:27:17.566 --> 00:27:19.856\nas you can see there are quite a few.\n\n494\n00:27:19.856 --> 00:27:28.570\nIn fact if we count that, let's see if I\ncan pipe that into a line count, actually.\n\n495\n00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:32.743\nWe get 500 and I know that's hard to\nsee with this other window behind it.\n\n496\n00:27:32.743 --> 00:27:34.536\nLet me drop that down for a second.\n\n497\n00:27:34.536 --> 00:27:42.130\n554 scripts in there so\na lot of scripts available for us to use.\n\n498\n00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:45.390\nAnd most of them have help\nassociated with them.\n\n499\n00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:50.250\nYou can get help on those\nindividual scripts.\n\n500\n00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.250\nWhat else do I wanna show you?\n\n501\n00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.440\nYou can run categories of scripts.\n\n502\n00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.506\nLet's just find one.\n\n503\n00:27:56.506 --> 00:28:02.113\nLet's do one of the SMBs and\nscroll back up here.\n\n504\n00:28:02.113 --> 00:28:07.188\nAnd I don't know.\n\n505\n00:28:07.188 --> 00:28:09.420\nWe'll see if, oops, that's not an SMB.\n\n506\n00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.960\nNone of these are actually\ngoing to work on mine.\n\n507\n00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.314\nWell let's do the smb-os-discovery,\nthat might work on my 2016 box there, so\n\n508\n00:28:18.314 --> 00:28:19.530\nsmb-os-discovery.\n\n509\n00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:20.960\nI can remember that.\n\n510\n00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.853\nSo what we'll do is we'll do nmap--script\n\n511\n00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:32.520\n--script, and that's not right Michael.\n\n512\n00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.360\nIf you wanna get the help,\nI'll show you that one first.\n\n513\n00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.079\nMan, struggling with\nmy typing again today.\n\n514\n00:28:37.079 --> 00:28:43.616\n--script-help And\n\n515\n00:28:43.616 --> 00:28:47.984\nthat was smb= smb-os,\n\n516\n00:28:47.984 --> 00:28:53.185\nit was smb-os-discovery.\n\n517\n00:28:56.856 --> 00:29:01.175\nAnd we won't go through and read all of\nthis, but here you can see, basically,\n\n518\n00:29:01.175 --> 00:29:02.930\nwe have a man page on the script.\n\n519\n00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:05.960\nIt's gonna tell you if there are any\nparameters that are necessary to go\n\n520\n00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.990\nwith that script.\n\n521\n00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.384\nWhat it's gonna look for,\nthings like that.\n\n522\n00:29:08.384 --> 00:29:11.246\nAnd before you run a script,\ndefinitely go in and read this,\n\n523\n00:29:11.246 --> 00:29:13.730\nespecially if you're running\nit on a work network.\n\n524\n00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:17.640\nWith permission, all right,\ndon't run anything without permission.\n\n525\n00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.155\nBut you wanna make sure you\nunderstand what the script is doing,\n\n526\n00:29:21.155 --> 00:29:23.444\nbefore you just go and run those scripts.\n\n527\n00:29:23.444 --> 00:29:31.029\nSo if I actually wanna\nexecute this script,\n\n528\n00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:36.156\nI could do, say, nmap- sV.\n\n529\n00:29:36.156 --> 00:29:41.617\nActually let's just do this,\n\n530\n00:29:41.617 --> 00:29:48.974\n-script=smb-os- discovery.nsc.\n\n531\n00:29:48.974 --> 00:29:50.134\nI can leave that off there.\n\n532\n00:29:50.134 --> 00:29:53.499\nAnd my target is gonna be 10.0.100.200.\n\n533\n00:29:53.499 --> 00:29:57.875\nAnd it's gonna begin to run this script.\n\n534\n00:29:57.875 --> 00:30:03.720\nAnd this particular script\nis going to query SMP and\n\n535\n00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.790\ntry to use that information\nto do OS detection.\n\n536\n00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:11.230\nAnd a lot of times this is a little more\naccurate cuz it goes a little more in\n\n537\n00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.680\ndepth with that.\n\n538\n00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.540\nI love that script.\n\n539\n00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.184\nSo there I can see, I mean,\nit tells me my build number even, right?\n\n540\n00:30:18.184 --> 00:30:21.802\nThat's a lot more accurate than\nthat OS guessing that it was doing.\n\n541\n00:30:21.802 --> 00:30:27.100\nJust based on the port response\ninformation that we got from the scan.\n\n542\n00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.589\nSo really cool, again,\nyou see all the ports that are open.\n\n543\n00:30:29.589 --> 00:30:34.133\nBut the idea here is again, I just\nwanna make sure you're familiar with\n\n544\n00:30:34.133 --> 00:30:37.023\nthe scripts that\nare available within Nmap.\n\n545\n00:30:37.023 --> 00:30:40.190\nWhat else can we do, Daniel?\n\n546\n00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.570\nDid we see everything?\n\n547\n00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:44.460\n&gt;&gt; We've done a lot.\n\n548\n00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.422\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nI was trying to think of it.\n\n549\n00:30:45.422 --> 00:30:46.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wait.\n\n550\n00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:48.106\nThere was something running that\nwe were waiting to finish, right?\n\n551\n00:30:48.106 --> 00:30:49.654\nI knew there was something I'm forgetting.\n\n552\n00:30:49.654 --> 00:30:50.516\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nThat's right.\n\n553\n00:30:50.516 --> 00:30:51.140\nYou had a scan going.\n\n554\n00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.160\nIt's still rocking.\n\n555\n00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.930\n&gt;&gt; It's still going but\nthat's because we did that very proposed-\n\n556\n00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:55.530\n&gt;&gt; Dash nine.\n\n557\n00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:56.374\n&gt;&gt; And we did the intensity nine.\n\n558\n00:30:56.374 --> 00:30:59.836\nYeah, so just a good way to show you\nhey if you step up that intensity,\n\n559\n00:30:59.836 --> 00:31:01.712\nbe prepared to go get a cup of coffee.\n\n560\n00:31:01.712 --> 00:31:02.687\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n561\n00:31:02.687 --> 00:31:05.279\nMike's server's getting hammered\nright now and it's going,\n\n562\n00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:07.000\nplease stop whatever you're doing.\n\n563\n00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.450\nAnother cool this is,\nyou saw what Mike did.\n\n564\n00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.370\nHe had one script running\nthat was taking a long time.\n\n565\n00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.158\nHe could open up another terminal and\nrun another script.\n\n566\n00:31:14.158 --> 00:31:17.387\nIf you find things that\nare running slowly or\n\n567\n00:31:17.387 --> 00:31:21.846\nif you do a large block of IPs,\nbreak it up into chunks of ten.\n\n568\n00:31:21.846 --> 00:31:25.348\nOpen up ten different sessions,\nyour computer will be able to handle that.\n\n569\n00:31:25.348 --> 00:31:29.120\nYour network card will be able to\nhandle that, should speed things up.\n\n570\n00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.350\nSo now Nmap is running ten different\ninstances against only ten machines,\n\n571\n00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.930\nmakes it run a whole lot faster.\n\n572\n00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.340\nIt's one of the benefits of using Nmap.\n\n573\n00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:41.353\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, it's a fantastic\ntool, get in there and play with it,\n\n574\n00:31:41.353 --> 00:31:43.040\nlots of options with Nmap.\n\n575\n00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.300\nIt is like we said the Swiss Army\nknife of scanners.\n\n576\n00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:46.910\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n577\n00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:47.940\nAnd Netcat would disagree.\n\n578\n00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.085\nBut I guess-\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n579\n00:31:49.085 --> 00:31:51.286\n&gt;&gt; Netcat is made by\nthe same people that make.\n\n580\n00:31:51.286 --> 00:31:51.952\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n581\n00:31:51.952 --> 00:31:52.766\n&gt;&gt; Or at least they are now.\n\n582\n00:31:52.766 --> 00:31:53.380\nThey're distributed.\n\n583\n00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.680\nAnyway, that being said you've\nseen scanners, you understand now,\n\n584\n00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.320\nyou can With scanners you do\nthings like host discovery.\n\n585\n00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.749\nWe do things like up ports discovery,\nwhat ports are open,\n\n586\n00:32:02.749 --> 00:32:06.798\nwhat services are running on those\nports during the banner grabbing,\n\n587\n00:32:06.798 --> 00:32:11.053\nthe versioning, things of that nature,\nOS discovery very helpful, and\n\n588\n00:32:11.053 --> 00:32:15.615\nthen even vulnerability detection,\nwith Mmap anyway you can do that.\n\n589\n00:32:15.615 --> 00:32:17.316\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's lots of scripts in there.\n\n590\n00:32:17.316 --> 00:32:20.746\nIf you solve in that list like\nSNB vulnerability checks for\n\n591\n00:32:20.746 --> 00:32:22.505\nparticular vulnerabilities.\n\n592\n00:32:22.505 --> 00:32:24.455\nThe other thing I wanna mention\nthere are some of those scripts that\n\n593\n00:32:24.455 --> 00:32:27.665\nyou can do that'll go out and\nhit Whois databases and\n\n594\n00:32:27.665 --> 00:32:31.705\nAirnlookups and actually show you in your\nresults, in fact, let's do one more.\n\n595\n00:32:31.705 --> 00:32:35.000\nI know we're out of time, but\nI promise this won't take nearly as long.\n\n596\n00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.376\n&gt;&gt; It'll only say 27 minutes.\n\n597\n00:32:36.376 --> 00:32:38.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It always says 27 minutes.\n\n598\n00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:42.290\nLet's do one, let's do a dash,\nwhat do we wanna do?\n\n599\n00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:47.606\nLet's do a -sV, and\nI'll just do one of the scripts,\n\n600\n00:32:47.606 --> 00:32:52.250\n--script asn and\n\n601\n00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.660\nyou can actually run multiple scripts\nby doing like a comma separated list.\n\n602\n00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.720\nAnd that's not gonna work Mike without a-\n&gt;&gt; Nope, you're gonna need an equal sign\n\n603\n00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.161\nbetween those two\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you are, let's do asn, and\n\n604\n00:33:02.161 --> 00:33:04.350\nI can also do wild cards, right?\n\n605\n00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:07.160\nThere are several Whois scripts.\n\n606\n00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.900\nSo I can do Whois asterisk and\n\n607\n00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.820\nthat'll actually do any script\nthat starts with Whois.\n\n608\n00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:16.223\nI do this a lot with the SMB/b cuz there's\nso many SMB scripts I just do -s script\n\n609\n00:33:16.223 --> 00:33:20.210\n= SMB asterisk and\nrun all the SMB scripts or you can do.\n\n610\n00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.430\nThere's categories within\nthose scripts as well.\n\n611\n00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.810\nAnd I should actually hit enter\nwhile I'm standing here talking.\n\n612\n00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:27.390\nAnd there we go.\n\n613\n00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:28.090\n&gt;&gt; Function error.\n\n614\n00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.234\n&gt;&gt; Function error, you broke it.\n\n615\n00:33:29.234 --> 00:33:33.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; ASN did not match my, no\n\n616\n00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:34.780\n&gt;&gt; Maybe ASN query?\n\n617\n00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that helps, boy I\ntell you what, you try to go fast and\n\n618\n00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.460\nyour brain just goofs up.\n\n619\n00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.960\n&gt;&gt; That's the Navy Seal,\nsaying slow is smooth and smooth is fast.\n\n620\n00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.508\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n621\n00:33:45.508 --> 00:33:46.328\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n622\n00:33:46.328 --> 00:33:47.515\nSo we'll give that just a second.\n\n623\n00:33:47.515 --> 00:33:50.925\nAnd we don't even have to wait for\nthis to finish if we don't want.\n\n624\n00:33:50.925 --> 00:33:54.795\nIt's just cool to me the fact that not\nonly will those scan your local devices,\n\n625\n00:33:54.795 --> 00:33:57.775\nbut that'll turn around and\ntake that information, go out and\n\n626\n00:33:57.775 --> 00:34:02.525\nquery Whois databases and\nstuff like that and pull that information.\n\n627\n00:34:02.525 --> 00:34:04.865\nAnd all of this stuff can\nbe saved out to a file.\n\n628\n00:34:04.865 --> 00:34:08.555\nRemember, we can do that output or\nwe can simply use a caret or\n\n629\n00:34:08.555 --> 00:34:12.730\na greater than symbol and pipe it right\nout to a text file for further analysis.\n\n630\n00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:13.830\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff.\n\n631\n00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:14.710\nSo there it is.\n\n632\n00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:18.410\nThere's Mmap, a scanner well\nprobably the defacto scanner.\n\n633\n00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:22.690\nIf you're not familiar with it, watch\nthis episode a bunch a million times and\n\n634\n00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:23.780\nget familiar with it.\n\n635\n00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.860\nWe have a whole series on Mmap,\ncheck that out.\n\n636\n00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:30.320\nIt is something that you'll\nprobably want to be familiar with\n\n637\n00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.750\nas a security specialist.\n\n638\n00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.390\nThat being said, we are well out of time.\n\n639\n00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:38.220\nMike blew our [LAUGH] allotment of time by\nquite a few minutes, but that's all right.\n\n640\n00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:41.070\nIt was for a good cause,\nfor seeing how Mmap works.\n\n641\n00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:41.958\nThanks Mike for that.\n\n642\n00:34:41.958 --> 00:34:43.266\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n643\n00:34:43.266 --> 00:34:44.910\n&gt;&gt; And we thank you guys for watching but\n\n644\n00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:46.100\nit's time to sign off.\n\n645\n00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.420\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n646\n00:34:48.420 -->

00:00:08.312\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:12.127\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:14.353\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:17.070\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.670\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today’s episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.190\nwe are back with guess what, that’s right.\n\n9\n00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.540\nMore of our CSA+, and\njoining us in the studio,\n\n10\n00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.690\nyou might know him as, well, Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.126\nMike, welcome back, man, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.126 --> 00:00:30.920\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.780\nThanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.420\nHopefully, some of you\nout there recognize me.\n\n15\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.623\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah,\n\n16\n00:00:34.623 --> 00:00:36.348\nso we're gonna have\na little bit of fun today.\n\n17\n00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:39.830\nWe kind of wrapped up most of the lecture\nthat has to do with our CSA, so\n\n18\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.480\nI thought I'd take a few episodes to kind\nof try to tie some of it together and give\n\n19\n00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.360\nus a little bit of a practical application\nof some of the things we've done.\n\n20\n00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.762\nUsing scanners, looking for\nvulnerabilities,\n\n21\n00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:57.541\nfinding exploits that can take\nadvantage of those vulnerabilities,\n\n22\n00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:02.247\nand then performing an attack and\nactually compromising a machine.\n\n23\n00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:05.246\nNow we're gonna keep it really simple,\nagain,\n\n24\n00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:10.093\nthis is not a class where we learn how to\nwrite exploits and anything like that.\n\n25\n00:01:10.093 --> 00:01:13.338\nWe're just kinda trying to tie\nsome of the concepts together that\n\n26\n00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:17.600\nwe've learnt throughout this class, just\nto show you what some of the potential is.\n\n27\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.860\nSo we're gonna keep it real simple.\n\n28\n00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.590\nWe're gonna use a metasploitable VM, which\nis a machine that is set up to be very,\n\n29\n00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.970\nvery vulnerable,\nas we saw it in our scans earlier.\n\n30\n00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.740\nWe saw 400 and some odd vulnerabilities.\n\n31\n00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.508\nSo it's no surprise that\nwe can compromise it.\n\n32\n00:01:35.508 --> 00:01:38.250\nBut we wanna see it,\nlet's see how it works.\n\n33\n00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.721\nHow somebody, as a penetration tester or\nas a cyber security professional or\n\n34\n00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:46.322\nan analyst, what you would go\nthrough to simulate an attack.\n\n35\n00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:48.348\nBecause if you start practicing these,\n\n36\n00:01:48.348 --> 00:01:50.620\nlike we need to learn\nabout log correlation.\n\n37\n00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.930\nWe need to learn about pulling\nthat information back,\n\n38\n00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.870\ndoing forensic,\ngetting an image of a drive.\n\n39\n00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.260\nWell, where do I practice that?\n\n40\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.960\nWell, you need to practice\nthe first part first, right?\n\n41\n00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.130\nPerform a couple of hacks on your test\nnetwork, compromise a couple of machines.\n\n42\n00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.350\nAnd then you can go back and look at your\nlogs from your routers or your servers or\n\n43\n00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.280\nyour compromised machine.\n\n44\n00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.460\nAnd try to get information and\nsee if you can see the attack and\n\n45\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.700\nhow it progressed through the network or\nwhat have you.\n\n46\n00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.560\nSo getting there and being able to play,\n\n47\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.210\nsetting up a little\nsandbox is the way to go.\n\n48\n00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.412\nAll right, so, we're gonna start\nout by just doing some scans, so\n\n49\n00:02:24.412 --> 00:02:29.590\nI'm gonna fire up, I'm gonna minimize\nthis, we'll talk about that in a minute.\n\n50\n00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.676\nGot my terminal open here\non my Calley Linux box, and\n\n51\n00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:36.675\nI've got my metasploitable running,\nlet's just ping that guy and\n\n52\n00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:40.470\nmake sure he's up and\nresponding to his IP address.\n\n53\n00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.975\nWhere did I put him at?\n\n54\n00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:44.410\n99, so there we go,\nmetasploitable's up and running.\n\n55\n00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.310\nWe are good to go, there.\n\n56\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.420\nAll right, and let's see,\nlet's start with good old NMAP.\n\n57\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.210\nAnd we'll start a couple\nof these scanners, and\n\n58\n00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.970\nthen we'll talk about\nthem as they finish up.\n\n59\n00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.880\nFor my NMAP, I'm just gonna do a -a.\n\n60\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.799\nInitially I might do, remember, we saw on\nother episodes, I would do a ping sweep,\n\n61\n00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.289\nfind my live host using NMAP,\nand then put that on a format.\n\n62\n00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:10.335\nI get my nice list of IP\naddresses from that, and\n\n63\n00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:15.298\nthen feed that back in to do my deeper\nscans or my banner grabs or what have you.\n\n64\n00:03:15.298 --> 00:03:19.110\nBut we already know the IP address and\nwe're just gonna go with that.\n\n65\n00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.832\nWe'll say 100.99, and I just wanna do\nanother scan, so we can kind of review\n\n66\n00:03:23.832 --> 00:03:28.450\nthe results of this and compare it to some\nof the other tools that we're gonna do.\n\n67\n00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.490\nSo let that run, that shouldn't\ntake more than a few minutes.\n\n68\n00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.765\nWhile that's going, we're going to\nfire up another tool called Nikto.\n\n69\n00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:39.225\nWe talked our Nikto we talked about that,\nand\n\n70\n00:03:39.225 --> 00:03:45.190\nhow are we looking as far as size-wise,\ndo I need to go up on any of that?\n\n71\n00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.964\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n72\n00:03:45.964 --> 00:03:47.429\n&gt;&gt; Yes?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's teeny tiny.\n\n73\n00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:50.258\n&gt;&gt; Mike, you must have the eyes\nof a falcon or something.\n\n74\n00:03:50.258 --> 00:03:51.618\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, not really.\n\n75\n00:03:51.618 --> 00:03:54.072\nI don't actually, but how's that?\n\n76\n00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.987\n&gt;&gt; He says that if you guys\ncome to the studio ever and\n\n77\n00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:01.002\nyou look at Mike's desktop,\nit is the resolution for\n\n78\n00:04:01.002 --> 00:04:04.022\npeople with coke bottles or\nsome sort of microscope.\n\n79\n00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:06.549\n&gt;&gt; It's the recommended resolution,\nwhat am I supposed to do?\n\n80\n00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:07.731\nIt's 1920 by 1080.\n\n81\n00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:08.957\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No,\n\n82\n00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:11.110\nthat's what they make contacts for.\n\n83\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.691\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n84\n00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:14.911\n&gt;&gt; And I always tell the doc, hey,\nbump me up a little bit on the mirror, so\n\n85\n00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:16.814\nthat I can read these little small print.\n\n86\n00:04:16.814 --> 00:04:18.633\n[LAUGH] What's wrong with this?\n\n87\n00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:19.794\nIt looks great.\n\n88\n00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:23.220\nI mean, I'm lying to him, I'm like no,\nno, I can't read that yet.\n\n89\n00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.565\nMake it a little stronger.\n\n90\n00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:30.135\nAll right, so Nikto, and remember, Niktos\nare a web app vulnerability scanner.\n\n91\n00:04:30.135 --> 00:04:32.395\nLet's throw that at it and\nsee what it comes up with.\n\n92\n00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:39.055\nRemember, with the Nikto, I just did Nikto\nand hit Enter, so we could get the help.\n\n93\n00:04:39.055 --> 00:04:43.815\nReally, the only real required\noption is that right there, host.\n\n94\n00:04:43.815 --> 00:04:45.855\nTell it who you are going to scan.\n\n95\n00:04:45.855 --> 00:04:50.070\nSo, let's do Nikto-Host.\n\n96\n00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.767\nAnd we'll do 10 0, oops,\nthat is not a 10, Michael.\n\n97\n00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:57.681\n10, 0, 100, 99, and\nwe're gonna let that guy run for a minute,\n\n98\n00:04:57.681 --> 00:05:00.960\nso that's another little come back and\ncheck on.\n\n99\n00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.580\nWe've got NMAP still going there.\n\n100\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.670\nLet's also fire up Open Vase.\n\n101\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.277\nSo let's do that one,\nlet me get another terminal.\n\n102\n00:05:12.277 --> 00:05:15.663\n[COUGH] Actually, you know what,\nI've already got Open Vase, I think,\n\n103\n00:05:15.663 --> 00:05:17.450\ngoing, and I've got the report run.\n\n104\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.970\nSo we'll come back and\nwe'll talk about that one.\n\n105\n00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.860\nLet's get Sparta going,\nthat's another one I wanted to show you.\n\n106\n00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.490\nSo we got a vulnerability analysis.\n\n107\n00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.280\nAnd then down to Sparta, and it fires up.\n\n108\n00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.370\nYou'll see it has a little command prompt\nfor our terminal in the background.\n\n109\n00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.016\nAnd then here's my nice gui.\n\n110\n00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:35.666\nIf you try to close that terminal,\nyou'll kill Sparta, so\n\n111\n00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:37.830\nleave that running back there.\n\n112\n00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.730\nAnd with Sparta, all we're gonna\ndo is click here to add your host,\n\n113\n00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.670\nI'll type in the appropriate IP address.\n\n114\n00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.150\nAnd I'll let it do NMAP Host and\nStaged NMAP Scan.\n\n115\n00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.480\nAnd one of the cool things about Sparta,\nSparta is a GUI front end for\n\n116\n00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.700\na lot of the command line utilities found,\nor that we use,\n\n117\n00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.300\nmany of which are found in Calley Linux.\n\n118\n00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.280\nSo it kind of becomes\nalmost a one stop shop.\n\n119\n00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.266\nIf you get familiar with Sparta,\nI think you'll really like it,\n\n120\n00:06:08.266 --> 00:06:09.963\nespecially if you're a GUI person.\n\n121\n00:06:09.963 --> 00:06:14.280\nBecause this in the background is going\nto run the things we're already running.\n\n122\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.600\nIt's gonna run NMAP, it's gonna run Nikto.\n\n123\n00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.070\nIt's gonna do some MySQL searches and\nPostgris and\n\n124\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.940\na few other things it's gonna do that we\ncould do independently on our own, right?\n\n125\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.760\nEach one of those tools is available.\n\n126\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.610\nAnd Sparta's not the tool that's doing it.\n\n127\n00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.812\nSparta is the interface that's sending\nthe commands to those tools, so\n\n128\n00:06:31.812 --> 00:06:32.660\nwe don't have to.\n\n129\n00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.833\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like the middle man,\nright?\n\n130\n00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:36.846\nIt's like hey,\nI know this guy NMAP, right?\n\n131\n00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:39.570\nI'm pretty familiar with that Nikto guy.\n\n132\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.470\nLet me go talk to them,\nwe gotta good thing going on, right?\n\n133\n00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.890\nSo I just go to Sparta and tell Sparta,\nhey, tell so and so and so and so,\n\n134\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.382\nit's kinda like delegation.\n\n135\n00:06:47.382 --> 00:06:49.847\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit even has that Brooklyn accent.\n\n136\n00:06:49.847 --> 00:06:54.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] lt had to sound shady.\n\n137\n00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.746\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and you did a good job.\n\n138\n00:06:55.746 --> 00:06:57.959\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] So I'll go ahead and\n\n139\n00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.740\nhit add host, I'll add those to the scope.\n\n140\n00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.368\nAnd it's gonna start running, and you'll\nsee as we look down at the logs down here,\n\n141\n00:07:06.368 --> 00:07:09.078\nwell, we'll let this run for a second.\n\n142\n00:07:09.078 --> 00:07:12.160\nGet that going.\n\n143\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.250\nIt's interesting,\nit only has one going so far.\n\n144\n00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.060\nThere it goes, all right,\nnow it's kicking in.\n\n145\n00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.230\nAnd you can see, hopefully you guys can\nsee, let me zoom in a little bit there.\n\n146\n00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.400\nYou can see Nikto, you can see NMAP.\n\n147\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.090\nAnd it stages the NMAP,\nso the idea is it's\n\n148\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.080\ntrying to break it up into smaller pieces,\nso that it's not creating as much traffic.\n\n149\n00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.410\nWe definitely don't wanna set off alarms\nif we're doing penetration testing.\n\n150\n00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.916\nIt can also prevent it from hammering\na system too hard with multiple tools and\n\n151\n00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:41.825\ncrashing our server, right,\nor anything like that.\n\n152\n00:07:41.825 --> 00:07:44.605\nWe don't wanna do that because\nthen we can't do our scans or\n\n153\n00:07:44.605 --> 00:07:46.284\nwhatever it is we're trying to do.\n\n154\n00:07:46.284 --> 00:07:50.432\nSo then you gotta keep in mind when you're\npen testing, is you wanna be careful what\n\n155\n00:07:50.432 --> 00:07:54.522\nyou're doing, because every time you hit\na machine, you're running the risk of\n\n156\n00:07:54.522 --> 00:07:58.950\nsetting off alarms, IDS's or IPS's,\nsomebody noticing that you're there.\n\n157\n00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:03.217\nAlso, you can end up changing the state of\nthe machine Which then changes everything\n\n158\n00:08:03.217 --> 00:08:04.188\nelse, all right?\n\n159\n00:08:04.188 --> 00:08:08.409\nIf you accidentally kill a service or\ncrash the machine, you're kind of dead in\n\n160\n00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:12.126\nthe water, hoping somebody maybe\neventually reboots the server, or\n\n161\n00:08:12.126 --> 00:08:14.470\ndoes something that restarts the service.\n\n162\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.030\nOr maybe there's a Windows\nupdate they have to reboot for.\n\n163\n00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.630\nYou might be waiting hours,\ndays, for that to happen.\n\n164\n00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.190\nCan be a pain, so\nyou want to be careful with that.\n\n165\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.090\nAll right, so let that run.\n\n166\n00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.150\nThat unfortunately does\ntake a few minutes to go.\n\n167\n00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.240\nSo we'll let that go in\nthe background there.\n\n168\n00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.380\nI'm just gonna minimize that terminal and\n\n169\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.900\nlet me bring back,\nwhoops I brought that one back too.\n\n170\n00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.096\nHere is our good old,\nthis one was NMAP, all right.\n\n171\n00:08:40.096 --> 00:08:44.600\nAnd again, I know that's small so\nlet's bump that up a wee bit.\n\n172\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.477\nHow's that guys and gals?\n\n173\n00:08:46.477 --> 00:08:49.920\nAll right, so\nthere's our NMAP scan, right.\n\n174\n00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.130\nAnd we definitely could have\noutput this to a file or\n\n175\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.550\nsomething else to make it\na little bit easier to look at.\n\n176\n00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.910\nAnd all we're seeing here,\nwe're seeing the open ports right.\n\n177\n00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.240\nAnd that dash a does more\nthan just a port scan.\n\n178\n00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.910\nIt's gonna do, looking at services,\nbanner graphing.\n\n179\n00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.580\nWe're looking into different ports trying\nto figure out what it is that's behind\n\n180\n00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.460\nthat open port.\n\n181\n00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.230\nIt's also going to do\nthe operating system detection.\n\n182\n00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.420\nIt runs a few of the safe\nscripts like the SMB type\n\n183\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.490\nscripts where it can try to enumerate\nusers and groups and things like that.\n\n184\n00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.679\nSo, we'll see a few interesting things and\nthe ones that are going to.\n\n185\n00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:27.319\nNow obviously, we've already run\nthrough this a few times just to make\n\n186\n00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:29.255\nsure everything is gonna work,\nand I'll tell you,\n\n187\n00:09:29.255 --> 00:09:31.460\nthe one we're gonna end up using\nis one of these right here.\n\n188\n00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.993\nThis vsftpd daemon which\nhad a back door in it.\n\n189\n00:09:35.993 --> 00:09:39.850\nThis is an older version\nof this vsftpd daemon.\n\n190\n00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.190\nThere was a known back door and\nit's a known vulnerability.\n\n191\n00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.550\nWe're gonna take advantage of that.\n\n192\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.550\nWhat else are we gonna take a look at?\n\n193\n00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.634\nWe'll also notice that this\nguy happens to be running.\n\n194\n00:09:49.634 --> 00:09:55.003\nSee if I can find it, there we go,\nanother oldie but goodie.\n\n195\n00:09:55.003 --> 00:10:00.070\nThe old unreal IRC daemon and\nthis is another known issue.\n\n196\n00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.905\nThere's an older version.\n\n197\n00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:04.202\nDaniel and\nI were talking about this earlier and\n\n198\n00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:07.370\nevery time you look at the vulnerability\nitself it will tell you.\n\n199\n00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:14.967\nIt says that Unreal had an issue where\nsomebody compromised their site,\n\n200\n00:10:14.967 --> 00:10:20.332\nwas able to upload the client or\nthe Unreal IRC TAR.\n\n201\n00:10:20.332 --> 00:10:23.439\nAnd so people people were downloading\nthis from what they thought was a safe\n\n202\n00:10:23.439 --> 00:10:24.043\nrepository.\n\n203\n00:10:24.043 --> 00:10:25.930\nIt actually had malware in it.\n\n204\n00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.620\nAnd I think this was back, gosh,\nI can't remember when this was.\n\n205\n00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.780\nI don't know the year It was 2011?\n\n206\n00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.710\nI can't remember.\n\n207\n00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.420\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember.\n\n208\n00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyway they found it and\n\n209\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.580\nthey replaced it so it's safe now.\n\n210\n00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.300\nI don't know do people still play Unreal?\n\n211\n00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.760\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea I would assume so.\n\n212\n00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.895\n&gt;&gt; I would assume so as well.\n\n213\n00:10:42.895 --> 00:10:45.165\nThe point is it had all been patched.\n\n214\n00:10:45.165 --> 00:10:49.769\nThis is an intentionally installed\nversion, so that we can have fun and\n\n215\n00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:51.698\nplay around, and hack on it.\n\n216\n00:10:51.698 --> 00:10:56.410\nBut the point is, through end map,\nI'm able to find all of these ports and\n\n217\n00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.170\nservices.\n\n218\n00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.160\nAnd so then what do I do?\n\n219\n00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.510\nWell, we start looking to see if\nthere's any known vulnerabilities,\n\n220\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.750\nlike let's take that first one,\nfor example.\n\n221\n00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:09.200\nVSFTP 2.3.4, if I didn't know\nanything about it, what would I do?\n\n222\n00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.800\nWell I break out my browser.\n\n223\n00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.360\nBe one option.\n\n224\n00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.390\nThere's several ways we can go about this.\n\n225\n00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:18.120\nAnd I go out to the exploits database\nhosted by Offensive Security.\n\n226\n00:11:19.655 --> 00:11:20.957\nAnd we'll do a little search.\n\n227\n00:11:23.133 --> 00:11:26.744\nAnd we'll type in let's see, vsftp daemon.\n\n228\n00:11:26.744 --> 00:11:31.436\nTell it I'm not a robot and hopefully I\ncan pass the captcha on the first try,\n\n229\n00:11:31.436 --> 00:11:32.730\nstreet signs.\n\n230\n00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.820\nThere's one, there's one.\n\n231\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.800\nMore street signs,\nthere's one, there's one.\n\n232\n00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.600\nPhew, good thing I'm glad\nto know I'm not a robot.\n\n233\n00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're not a robot.\n\n234\n00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.375\n&gt;&gt; And I'll go ahead and click search.\n\n235\n00:11:46.422 --> 00:11:47.566\nGive it just a second and bada-bing.\n\n236\n00:11:47.566 --> 00:11:52.015\nRight, there are, and\nlet's zoom into that for you guys.\n\n237\n00:11:52.015 --> 00:11:54.945\nThere are several different exploits\n\n238\n00:11:54.945 --> 00:11:59.540\nthat say they will compromise that\nVS FTPD version 2.3.4, all right.\n\n239\n00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.650\nSo you think great,\ngrab that first one and go.\n\n240\n00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.540\nAnd actually that first one\nis the one I'm gonna grab.\n\n241\n00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.080\nBut I want to make sure we understand when\nwe're working with things like this as you\n\n242\n00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.530\nget into your pin testing.\n\n243\n00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.230\nAnd you know you're that\ncyber security analyst and\n\n244\n00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.900\nyou're working with things like this,\nyou want to be really careful.\n\n245\n00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.250\nThese are exploits that were\nwritten by somebody else,\n\n246\n00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.390\nsomebody that we don't know, right?\n\n247\n00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.040\nAnd just because they're out here does\nnot necessarily mean they're gonna work\n\n248\n00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.485\nfirst of all, and\nthat they're not dangerous, right?\n\n249\n00:12:27.485 --> 00:12:29.115\nThat they don't do something bad.\n\n250\n00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:33.635\nSo like let's take a look at one that\nI know might have some issues here.\n\n251\n00:12:33.635 --> 00:12:35.755\nOr actually, you know what?\n\n252\n00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:36.735\nThat was for the IRC.\n\n253\n00:12:36.735 --> 00:12:38.495\nThere's another one I want to show you.\n\n254\n00:12:38.495 --> 00:12:42.060\nLet's look for the Unreal IRC daemon.\n\n255\n00:12:43.775 --> 00:12:46.195\nAnd unfortunately,\nI have to tell it I'm not a robot again.\n\n256\n00:12:46.195 --> 00:12:50.050\nNow Explore-Dev you can download\na copy of this keep it locally.\n\n257\n00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.560\nYou can go to GitHub has it.\n\n258\n00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.140\nYou can also use tools like\nmetasploit on your system.\n\n259\n00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.480\nAs long as you keep that up to\ndate you can search there and\n\n260\n00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.840\nyou don't have to deal\nwith the silly captcha.\n\n261\n00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.120\nObviously they want to keep robots and\nstuff from scraping all this content.\n\n262\n00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.490\nSo I understand what they are doing but\nit does get old.\n\n263\n00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.040\nIf you're doing this all the time It's so\nfrustrating,\n\n264\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.562\nbecause if I click back,\nI have to do the captcha again.\n\n265\n00:13:13.562 --> 00:13:15.370\nAll right, so if like, for\n\n266\n00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.230\nexample, where's the one I\nwant to you show here, unreal.\n\n267\n00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:22.005\nSo this guy down here, right, let's say we\nwere looking and we found that this was\n\n268\n00:13:22.005 --> 00:13:25.375\nrunning on our machine,\non a machine that we wanted to target.\n\n269\n00:13:25.375 --> 00:13:29.195\nAnd we're looking for an exploit, and\nmaybe this one will be the one I want,\n\n270\n00:13:29.195 --> 00:13:33.685\nRemote Downloader/Execute Trojan,\nsounds interesting.\n\n271\n00:13:33.685 --> 00:13:35.120\nSo we'll go take a look at it.\n\n272\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.972\nWe'll click on it, and they're\ngoing to show me the code for this.\n\n273\n00:13:38.972 --> 00:13:43.930\nEven if you're not an expert in Perl, you\n\n274\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.680\ndon't know every single language, there\nare certain things that I can look for.\n\n275\n00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.507\nAnd you'll start learning these\nas you go through them, and\n\n276\n00:13:50.507 --> 00:13:51.957\nyou play around more and more.\n\n277\n00:13:51.957 --> 00:13:56.069\nBut a couple of things that sticks out\nimmediately, when I look at this code,\n\n278\n00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:57.985\nis I look at these payload options.\n\n279\n00:13:57.985 --> 00:14:02.698\nAnd there's about five different payload\noptions, and each one of them, well,\n\n280\n00:14:02.698 --> 00:14:04.555\nat least the first three there.\n\n281\n00:14:04.555 --> 00:14:08.851\nLet me see if I can get all this on the\nscreen or most of it, are doing a Wget.\n\n282\n00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:13.791\nThat means, when I run this payload, if\nI was to send this over to my target and\n\n283\n00:14:13.791 --> 00:14:15.980\nexecute this on my target.\n\n284\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.150\nWhat it's gonna do is run this wget\ncommand if I chose one of those three\n\n285\n00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.330\npayloads to do.\n\n286\n00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.270\nIt's gonna do a wget, reach out.\n\n287\n00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.816\nLooks like the first one's going\nto packetstormsecurity.org and\n\n288\n00:14:25.816 --> 00:14:27.568\nit's pulling down a bindshell.\n\n289\n00:14:27.568 --> 00:14:32.244\nThe second one is going somewhere\nnetbs.webs.com/bot.txt and\n\n290\n00:14:32.244 --> 00:14:34.956\nthen changing the permissions on bot.\n\n291\n00:14:34.956 --> 00:14:39.553\nThe third one is going out and\ndoing some kind of reverse shell.\n\n292\n00:14:39.553 --> 00:14:43.757\nThe fourth one down there is just killing\neverything to do with the IRC daemon.\n\n293\n00:14:43.757 --> 00:14:50.610\nThe fifth one is removing all\ntraces of Unreal or that IRC.\n\n294\n00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.240\n&gt;&gt; No, it's removing all traces\nof your operating system.\n\n295\n00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.080\n&gt;&gt; It is, isn't?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.388\n&gt;&gt; Actually that looks like it's gonna,\n\n297\n00:14:55.388 --> 00:14:56.940\nyeah /bin/rm, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; This one,\n\n298\n00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.130\nI gotta remove all tracks that I was here.\n\n299\n00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's that final action.\n\n300\n00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.140\n&gt;&gt; That's the whole wipe the target thing.\n\n301\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] But here's the problem with this.\n\n302\n00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.550\nThese very well could be good and i'm not\nsaying there's anything wrong with these.\n\n303\n00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:12.400\nBut this is code that I don't know and\nI can't verify what that is.\n\n304\n00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.870\nWhen it's reaching out and\ngrabbing r dot text and\n\n305\n00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.520\npulling that down to my target,\nwhat is that?\n\n306\n00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.440\nRight, what's actually in there?\n\n307\n00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.910\nI can hope that it's a reverse\nshow code that I want to use.\n\n308\n00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.330\nIt will spawn a reverse code.\n\n309\n00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.954\nIt might not be and if I'm doing\na pen test on my own organization and\n\n310\n00:15:26.954 --> 00:15:30.192\nI'm trying to compromise the machine and\nI fire this off and\n\n311\n00:15:30.192 --> 00:15:33.725\nit turns out to be a Trojan horse\nthat calls home somewhere else.\n\n312\n00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:35.068\nBad things can happen.\n\n313\n00:15:35.068 --> 00:15:38.060\nSo you want to be careful when\nyou're working with these.\n\n314\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.180\nYou always want to examine the code.\n\n315\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.420\nMost likely you're gonna have to.\n\n316\n00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.970\nI know Daniel and I have pulled our\nhair out over this several times.\n\n317\n00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.131\nYou're gonna have to modify or examine\nit anyway cause it's not gonna work.\n\n318\n00:15:47.131 --> 00:15:53.060\nVery often these exploits\ndon't work out of the box.\n\n319\n00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.442\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you gotta go in and tweak them.\n\n320\n00:15:54.442 --> 00:15:57.312\n&gt;&gt; Actually, looks like,\nnow that i'm looking at it more closely.\n\n321\n00:15:57.312 --> 00:16:01.306\nIt looks like it's removing the home\ndirectory of whatever user which is\n\n322\n00:16:01.306 --> 00:16:03.050\nprobably root.\n\n323\n00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:04.479\nOr whatever user you're logging in as.\n\n324\n00:16:04.479 --> 00:16:05.443\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it's cd tilde there.\n\n325\n00:16:05.443 --> 00:16:06.301\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n326\n00:16:06.301 --> 00:16:09.553\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and then doing /bin/rm and\nthen /bin/rm.\n\n327\n00:16:09.553 --> 00:16:11.628\nSo maybe any applications you\nhad installed, like the IRC.\n\n328\n00:16:11.628 --> 00:16:15.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, or just your personal files and\nstuff, that's gone.\n\n329\n00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.190\n&gt;&gt; So that might or\nmight not be something you wanna do.\n\n330\n00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.501\nThe point is,\nI would wanna think about it first, and\n\n331\n00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:25.289\nmaybe run this in an isolated environment\nand get those files pulled down to my\n\n332\n00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:29.291\ntarget that I had control over and\nsee what was in there, right?\n\n333\n00:16:29.291 --> 00:16:30.807\nOr replace it altogether.\n\n334\n00:16:30.807 --> 00:16:32.814\nEverything else in this\ncode might work fine.\n\n335\n00:16:32.814 --> 00:16:35.310\nI don't trust the payloads,\nwrite your own payload.\n\n336\n00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.880\nUse something like MSF Venom, or something\nlike that to create your own payload,\n\n337\n00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.660\nyour own reverse shell\nthat you can see the code,\n\n338\n00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.011\nknow the code,\nknow what's gonna happen, all right?\n\n339\n00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.520\nAll right, enough of that,\nso let me close this.\n\n340\n00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:53.040\nThis is just something from our Sparta\nscan, which means it's probably finished.\n\n341\n00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.870\nSo let's flip back over to Sparta, and\nlet's take a look at what we've got.\n\n342\n00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.530\nNmap looks like it's still\nrunning on here, but that's okay.\n\n343\n00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.527\nWe just wanna kinda take a look\nat what Sparta does for us.\n\n344\n00:17:03.527 --> 00:17:08.315\nAnd you can see all these services,\nall right?\n\n345\n00:17:08.315 --> 00:17:13.542\nThis is just like an Nmap output, because\nit is Nmap, because it's actually running.\n\n346\n00:17:13.542 --> 00:17:15.897\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was gonna say, there's\na good reason for that, Mike [LAUGH].\n\n347\n00:17:15.897 --> 00:17:18.431\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because it's running\nNmap in the background.\n\n348\n00:17:18.431 --> 00:17:23.545\nSo I can see all that same information\nthat I saw earlier with my Nmap scan.\n\n349\n00:17:23.545 --> 00:17:25.885\nBut it does so much more than that.\n\n350\n00:17:25.885 --> 00:17:29.845\nWe'll see that, as I go through here,\ninformation, you can write notes.\n\n351\n00:17:29.845 --> 00:17:34.090\nHere's Nikto, now let's take a look and\ncompare this.\n\n352\n00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.980\nWhere is my Nikto?\n\n353\n00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.130\nThere we go.\n\n354\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.180\nLet me minimize these others, just to\nmake it a little more readable there.\n\n355\n00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.190\nSo this is where I ran,\nlet me scroll back up to show you.\n\n356\n00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.290\nThis is where I ran Nikto to my host.\n\n357\n00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.650\nIt's got all my target information.\n\n358\n00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:53.487\nAnd then I can see things like the\nanti-click jack X-Frame-Option header is\n\n359\n00:17:53.487 --> 00:17:54.370\nnot present.\n\n360\n00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.550\nUncommon header TCN found.\n\n361\n00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.790\nYou can see this, there's\na vulnerability there that it's found.\n\n362\n00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:06.190\nThere's a few vulnerabilities\nthat it's found, all right?\n\n363\n00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:12.217\nIf we take a look back at Sparta It's\nthe exact same information.\n\n364\n00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:13.456\nIn fact,\nit's actually a little more readable.\n\n365\n00:18:13.456 --> 00:18:15.198\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a little easier [LAUGH].\n\n366\n00:18:15.198 --> 00:18:16.339\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The font's a little small,\n\n367\n00:18:16.339 --> 00:18:18.470\nI would adjust that if this\nwas my normal workstation.\n\n368\n00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.430\nBut yeah, same information there.\n\n369\n00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.260\nScreenshot, here's what\nthe actual website looks like.\n\n370\n00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.510\nHere's some SMTP enumeration,\nit's a Kali box.\n\n371\n00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:28.345\nIt didn't do too well,\nit's not running any of that.\n\n372\n00:18:28.345 --> 00:18:30.560\nMySQL, let's see what it found in here.\n\n373\n00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.730\nThat one is still running, and\nI've had to kill it a couple times.\n\n374\n00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.218\nThey slow it down intentionally, and\n\n375\n00:18:37.218 --> 00:18:40.491\nit just seems to take\nforever to actually finish.\n\n376\n00:18:40.491 --> 00:18:43.780\nPostgreSQL, I ran a couple scripts and,\nwhat do you know?\n\n377\n00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.560\nLet me zoom in there, it found a password.\n\n378\n00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.870\nA log-in and a password.\n\n379\n00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.550\nFTP is default on 21.\n\n380\n00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:57.520\nAnd look, there's a log-on of FTP and\na password of FTP.\n\n381\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.490\nSo I was able to find that.\n\n382\n00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.590\nIt's got its own files for\ndoing any brute forcing.\n\n383\n00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.310\nYou can change that up,\nyou can point it to different name files.\n\n384\n00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.940\nWhat else?\nNikto on 8180.\n\n385\n00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.616\nSo there's a second website\non that server, and\n\n386\n00:19:12.616 --> 00:19:14.584\nthere's the screenshot for that.\n\n387\n00:19:14.584 --> 00:19:18.293\nWe can go over to Services, and\nwe can see the different services,\n\n388\n00:19:18.293 --> 00:19:21.483\nlook at FTP, I can see a little\nbit of information there.\n\n389\n00:19:21.483 --> 00:19:26.676\nWe've got Tools, and I can go to Nikto and\nI can see that again.\n\n390\n00:19:26.676 --> 00:19:30.632\nWhat's really cool is, if I right-click,\nif you can see this menu.\n\n391\n00:19:30.632 --> 00:19:35.152\nSend a brute, open in browser, take\na screenshot, run Nmap, launch WebSlayer,\n\n392\n00:19:35.152 --> 00:19:36.326\nall kinds of things.\n\n393\n00:19:36.326 --> 00:19:42.620\nThis is tying into all the different\ntools that are on my system, all right?\n\n394\n00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.050\nIt does have a brute force attacker.\n\n395\n00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.180\nThat way I could right-click one of those,\n\n396\n00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.640\nsend to brute,\nit populates this information.\n\n397\n00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.750\nI point it to a Word list, and\nwe're off to the races and\n\n398\n00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.840\nit starts brute forcing passwords.\n\n399\n00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.590\nSo a really cool tool there,\ngives me a lot of good information.\n\n400\n00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:02.920\nSo Sparta, again, kind of a GUI front\nend for a lot of different tools.\n\n401\n00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.680\n&gt;&gt; Well Mike, now that we've got\nall this information gathered up,\n\n402\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.730\nwhat the heck do we do with it?\n\n403\n00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're gonna have some fun\nwith it is what we're gonna do.\n\n404\n00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.600\nLet me close some things down,\nI'm gonna clean up the screen here.\n\n405\n00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:21.240\nWe'll get rid of Nikto, and\nthat was Sparta's background window.\n\n406\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.570\nThe last one,\nI do wanna show you one more.\n\n407\n00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.454\nIf we look at Greenbone Security over\nhere, Greenbone Security Assistant,\n\n408\n00:20:26.454 --> 00:20:27.710\nthis is OpenVas.\n\n409\n00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.581\nAnd once you run OpenVas, it sets up\na little web server on your machine and\n\n410\n00:20:31.581 --> 00:20:32.340\nyou connect.\n\n411\n00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.467\nAnd you can see I'm connected to local\nhost 93.92, that's the default for\n\n412\n00:20:36.467 --> 00:20:37.020\nthis one.\n\n413\n00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.370\nBut, of course, you can change that.\n\n414\n00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:43.230\nAnd I've already run the scan,\nbecause it does take a little while.\n\n415\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:49.719\nBut I scanned Metasploitable with this\nguy, and I can see I've got 299 total.\n\n416\n00:20:49.719 --> 00:20:52.359\nAs I go down through here\nwe can see the list of all\n\n417\n00:20:52.359 --> 00:20:54.408\nthose different vulnerabilities.\n\n418\n00:20:54.408 --> 00:20:57.570\nYou can then find the one\nyou're looking for.\n\n419\n00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.348\nLike here's that VSFTPD,\n\n420\n00:20:59.348 --> 00:21:04.430\nIf I click on that it gives me a nice\nsummary about the information.\n\n421\n00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.920\nBut notice it tells me, look,\nhey there's a vendor fix.\n\n422\n00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.810\nYou can get the repaired package from\nsecurity dot blah blah blah blah, and\n\n423\n00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:12.480\nyou can patch this.\n\n424\n00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.230\nSo if this was on a system that\nwasn't meant to be vulnerable.\n\n425\n00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.600\nAnd you're doing your\ncyber security analyst.\n\n426\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.930\nYou're that cyber security\nprofessional at your organization.\n\n427\n00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.740\nIt's like, okay,\nI found this vulnerability.\n\n428\n00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.660\nI'm not trying to compromise this system,\nI work for the organization.\n\n429\n00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.140\nI need to fix the system.\n\n430\n00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.210\nSomething like this can tell me,\nhey, there's a vendor fix.\n\n431\n00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:34.250\nYou can go out and get more information\nout on the web, gives you some nice links.\n\n432\n00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.660\nSo really cool tool as well.\n\n433\n00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.040\nAnd, remember, that was open source and\nfree, OpenVAS.\n\n434\n00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:39.680\nIt's a good one to use.\n\n435\n00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.270\nAll right, so\nDaniel says it's time to go to work.\n\n436\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.820\nI tell you what we should do, Daniel.\n\n437\n00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.175\nLet's search for\na couple of exploits and then we'll, so\n\n438\n00:21:51.175 --> 00:21:53.578\nthat we don't have to kind of break it up.\n\n439\n00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:55.975\nWe'll save the attack phase for\nonce we get back,\n\n440\n00:21:55.975 --> 00:21:58.670\nbecause it does look like\nwe're getting close on time.\n\n441\n00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:04.100\nAnd I showed you the Exploit DB\nout there on the web.\n\n442\n00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.102\nLet's do Searchsploit is another one.\n\n443\n00:22:06.102 --> 00:22:09.599\nI'm gonna go ahead and close this,\nwe don't need this right now,\n\n444\n00:22:09.599 --> 00:22:10.916\nor minimize it at least.\n\n445\n00:22:10.916 --> 00:22:12.579\nGrab us a new terminal,\n\n446\n00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:16.828\nand let's take a look at a couple\nother options that we have.\n\n447\n00:22:16.828 --> 00:22:19.914\nSearchsploit, and\n\n448\n00:22:19.914 --> 00:22:24.637\nlet's do VSFTPD, all right?\n\n449\n00:22:24.637 --> 00:22:27.778\nAnd I'm gonna zoom in, or\nI might bump that up a wee bit for you.\n\n450\n00:22:30.163 --> 00:22:33.764\nHere we go, we can see that\nwithin the Metasploit database,\n\n451\n00:22:33.764 --> 00:22:37.306\nhere's the root path for\nwhere these exploits are stored.\n\n452\n00:22:37.306 --> 00:22:40.336\nIt's just a local copy of the exploit\ndatabase that we were searching\n\n453\n00:22:40.336 --> 00:22:41.401\non the web.\n\n454\n00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:45.622\nAnd there's those same exploits, and so\n\n455\n00:22:45.622 --> 00:22:49.727\nif I wanted to take\na look at one of those.\n\n456\n00:22:49.727 --> 00:22:54.408\nLet's see, if we did a little bit of cat,\nwe'll say switch user.\n\n457\n00:22:54.408 --> 00:22:57.490\nAnd, yeah, I could go and copy and\npaste this stuff, but I like to type.\n\n458\n00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:01.132\nExploit db platforms,\n\n459\n00:23:01.132 --> 00:23:05.325\nyou wanna say Unix remote.\n\n460\n00:23:09.609 --> 00:23:16.492\nAnd then we'll do that 17491 RB, a little\nbit of Ruby script, and here's that code.\n\n461\n00:23:16.492 --> 00:23:20.491\nSo, again, I'd wanna look through this and\nmake sure that I knew\n\n462\n00:23:20.491 --> 00:23:24.500\nexactly what this exploit was going to do,\nbest of my abilities.\n\n463\n00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.000\nIf I'm not out, Ruby,\nthis one is written in Ruby.\n\n464\n00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.710\nIf I wasn't a Ruby guy,\nat least I wanna kinda look through there,\n\n465\n00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.370\nif I see anything unusual that\nI might not trust, all right?\n\n466\n00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:37.340\nAll right, so\n\n467\n00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.840\nthat's good old Searchsploit, and the last\none would be right from the MSF console.\n\n468\n00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.030\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nfire up MSF console.\n\n469\n00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.260\nMSF console is the interface you\nuse to work with Metasploit.\n\n470\n00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.784\nSo it's gonna launch my\nMetasploit framework.\n\n471\n00:23:52.784 --> 00:23:54.170\nPermission denied?\n\n472\n00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.650\nThat's their little, yeah, sorry.\n\n473\n00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.620\nThey do a lot of really cool things.\n\n474\n00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.588\nEvery time you fire it up, you get a\nlittle different message, or ASCII art, or\n\n475\n00:24:02.588 --> 00:24:04.320\nsomething like that, kinda fun.\n\n476\n00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.297\n&gt;&gt; You know where that comes from right,\nMike?\n\n477\n00:24:05.297 --> 00:24:05.869\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n478\n00:24:05.869 --> 00:24:08.694\n&gt;&gt; That's from Jurassic Park.\n\n479\n00:24:08.694 --> 00:24:09.359\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n480\n00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:10.522\n&gt;&gt; That's the,\nyou didn't say the magic word.\n\n481\n00:24:10.522 --> 00:24:14.237\n&gt;&gt; You didn't say the magic word, [SOUND].\n\n482\n00:24:14.237 --> 00:24:16.239\n&gt;&gt; They're jokesters over there\nat Metasploitable [LAUGH].\n\n483\n00:24:16.239 --> 00:24:18.852\n&gt;&gt; They are, very funny guys and gals.\n\n484\n00:24:18.852 --> 00:24:26.074\nAll right, so from here I can just type\nsearch, and then the same thing, VSFTPD.\n\n485\n00:24:26.074 --> 00:24:30.388\nAnd it only came back with one,\ninterestingly enough, but\n\n486\n00:24:30.388 --> 00:24:31.950\nthere's that same.\n\n487\n00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:36.361\nBecause this is really not searching for\nvulnerabilities,\n\n488\n00:24:36.361 --> 00:24:41.818\nthis is searching for actually known\nexploits that it has in its database.\n\n489\n00:24:41.818 --> 00:24:44.948\nThey found the one that, I guess I\nprobably haven't updated this, so\n\n490\n00:24:44.948 --> 00:24:46.410\nit didn't find any others.\n\n491\n00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.205\n&gt;&gt; So Metasploit is assuming you know\nthere's a vulnerability already,\n\n492\n00:24:49.205 --> 00:24:50.323\nnow you're just looking for\n\n493\n00:24:50.323 --> 00:24:53.090\nexploits that are available\nthrough the Metasploit framework?\n\n494\n00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n495\n00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.903\nAnd this is what you sit here and\ndo all day long is you search.\n\n496\n00:24:57.903 --> 00:25:04.970\nAll right, I've got a Windows machine,\nand I wanna do a remote exploit.\n\n497\n00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:10.979\nAnd maybe I'm looking for\nsomething with SMB, oops, not SMD.\n\n498\n00:25:10.979 --> 00:25:11.616\n&gt;&gt; And yet, you still find something.\n\n499\n00:25:11.616 --> 00:25:13.655\n&gt;&gt; SMD found some good results, right?\n\n500\n00:25:13.655 --> 00:25:14.241\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n501\n00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:16.500\nlet's try again with SMB, all right?\n\n502\n00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.361\nAnd you can use wildcards with this\nsearch, and this is where I'm like,\n\n503\n00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:23.820\nwow, there's a lot of them,\nI start to go through there.\n\n504\n00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.070\nI find it a little bit\neasier using Searchsploit,\n\n505\n00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:32.180\njust the format, the way it's laid out,\nor doing the online search.\n\n506\n00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.280\n&gt;&gt; Agreed.\n&gt;&gt; It is a little bit easier to work with.\n\n507\n00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.079\nAll right, so now we're good to go.\n\n508\n00:25:38.079 --> 00:25:41.133\nWe were going to come back\nin our next episode, and\n\n509\n00:25:41.133 --> 00:25:43.325\nwe'll grab one of those exploits.\n\n510\n00:25:43.325 --> 00:25:46.149\nAnd we'll see if we can exploit\nthat Metasploitable box.\n\n511\n00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:50.479\nIf we can't, we probably shouldn't\nbe security professionals.\n\n512\n00:25:50.479 --> 00:25:52.595\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\nyou heard it here first, folks.\n\n513\n00:25:52.595 --> 00:25:54.154\nIf you can't do this-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No pressure.\n\n514\n00:25:54.154 --> 00:25:57.365\n&gt;&gt; Then just get that Truck Masters\nnumber from someone [LAUGH].\n\n515\n00:25:57.365 --> 00:25:59.815\nAll right Mike, we're joking,\nhaving a good time.\n\n516\n00:25:59.815 --> 00:26:02.525\nWe're going to finish\nthis up in a part two.\n\n517\n00:26:02.525 --> 00:26:04.810\nWe do thank you guys for\njoining us here in part one.\n\n518\n00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.240\nI know we're leaving you\nwith a bit of a cliffhanger,\n\n519\n00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.070\nbecause we want you to come back.\n\n520\n00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:10.400\nSee how this all plays out in the end.\n\n521\n00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.320\nMike, thanks for joining us,\n\n522\n00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.940\nlooking forward to seeing you in part two,\nyou guys as well.\n\n523\n00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.660\nThat being said we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n524\n00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.880\nFor ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n525\n00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.520\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n526\n00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.689\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n527\n00:26:21.689 --> 00:26:27.472\n[MUSIC]\n\n528\n00:26:27.472 --> 00:26:30.708\nThank you for watching

00:00:08.285\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:12.147\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.147 --> 00:00:14.067\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:16.650\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.568\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n8\n00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:22.340\nand in this episode we are back\nwith more on our CSA+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.350\nAnd joining us for\na part two on some practical application\n\n10\n00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.070\nkind of taken everything we've learned,\nrolling it up in a ball and\n\n11\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.940\nactually doing something with it,\nour good friend Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n12\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.237\nMike welcome back sir, how's it going man?\n\n13\n00:00:33.237 --> 00:00:34.738\n&gt;&gt; It's going great thanks for\nhaving me back.\n\n14\n00:00:34.738 --> 00:00:39.714\nAnd yeah we're getting ready to get\ninto some of the fun stuff, what we do\n\n15\n00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:44.785\nall this for, maybe I don't now,\nI mean it is the exciting part, right?\n\n16\n00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:48.022\nIn the previous episode, if you didn't\nwatch part one, make sure you go back and\n\n17\n00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:50.513\ncheck that out because we've\ngot our groundwork laid there.\n\n18\n00:00:50.513 --> 00:00:54.770\nWe did our different scans, we compared\nour results from different scanners.\n\n19\n00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.470\nWe didn't really do any comparison, but\n\n20\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.567\nthat's what I would do if\nI was working on this.\n\n21\n00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:02.530\nYou're looking for false positives, right?\n\n22\n00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.350\nSeeing if more than one tool\ncomes up with the same results.\n\n23\n00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.791\nSome tools gave us more\ninformation than others.\n\n24\n00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:10.970\nIn the end, we found a couple\nthat we were curious about.\n\n25\n00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.610\nNow again,\nI've already set all of this up.\n\n26\n00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.651\nBut if I hadn't, we would've taken\nthat list from NMAP for example,\n\n27\n00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:22.363\nor from, OpenBAS, right.\n\n28\n00:01:22.363 --> 00:01:24.020\nAnd we would have started going down,\nall right look.\n\n29\n00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.457\nIt's running this service,\nthis version, let's go out and\n\n30\n00:01:27.457 --> 00:01:29.184\nsee what we can find all right?\n\n31\n00:01:29.184 --> 00:01:30.860\nAnd then we go to the next port, right?\n\n32\n00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.289\nAnd you keep doing your research and\nseeing.\n\n33\n00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.070\nYou try to gather every bit of\ninformation you can along the way.\n\n34\n00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.720\nLeave no stone unturned, right?\n\n35\n00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.700\nChecking everything out, looking for\n\n36\n00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.281\nany older application\nthat hasn't been patched.\n\n37\n00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:46.944\nYou go out and see what kind of\nvulnerabilities are out there.\n\n38\n00:01:46.944 --> 00:01:48.634\nBecause a lot of times it is not\nthe most obvious one, right?\n\n39\n00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:52.399\nThe one that jumps out at you is the one\nthat actually doesn't actually work\n\n40\n00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.010\nthat well.\n\n41\n00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.420\nThere might be another one that\nis very simple to exploit, so\n\n42\n00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.080\nalways check out all of your\noptions as you are going through.\n\n43\n00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.002\nAll right, so\nwe know what we wanna do though.\n\n44\n00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:07.046\nWe wanna take advantage of the VSFTPD,\nbecause we know that's an older,\n\n45\n00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:08.296\nvulnerable version.\n\n46\n00:02:08.296 --> 00:02:10.606\nAgain, it's intentional\non that exploitable.\n\n47\n00:02:10.606 --> 00:02:14.439\nAnd we're also gonna take a look at\nthat unreal IRCD, which we talked about.\n\n48\n00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.407\nIt's a known issue,\na backdoor, that's been fixed.\n\n49\n00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:22.530\nBut this is the old version intentionally\nso that we can compromise it.\n\n50\n00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.371\nSo let's see what we can do.\n\n51\n00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:28.027\nFrom my MSF console, let's search one\nmore time just so we can kind of see it,\n\n52\n00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:30.810\nplus I can get the path for\nit, which is always necessary.\n\n53\n00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.035\nWe're gonna do search vsftpd.\n\n54\n00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:40.295\nAnd I'll do 2.3.4,\njust to get a little specific with it and\n\n55\n00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:43.910\nsure enough it gets me down\nto one matching module.\n\n56\n00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.501\nTells me its rank is excellent.\n\n57\n00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:50.020\nThat means it's a pretty\nsuccessful exploit.\n\n58\n00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.750\nSo that's the one we wanna use.\n\n59\n00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.440\nHow do we do that with\nour municipal framework?\n\n60\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.980\nWe type in the word use because\nwe wanna use that, right.\n\n61\n00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.060\nEasy enough to remember.\n\n62\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.459\nSo we're gonna say use and\nthen the path right above me there.\n\n63\n00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.770\nExploit, switch unix, ftp,\n\n64\n00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.790\nvsftpd_234_backdoor, I hit enter.\n\n65\n00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.544\nAnd now you'll notice\nmy prompt has changed.\n\n66\n00:03:17.544 --> 00:03:19.282\nAfter the misf, I got exploit and\n\n67\n00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:23.380\nthen parenthesis the name of\nthe exploit I'm currently working with.\n\n68\n00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.870\nSo it's loaded up that module for\nthis particular exploit.\n\n69\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.305\nSo now, what you wanna do is,\nyou do a little show options, and\n\n70\n00:03:32.305 --> 00:03:36.094\nyou see what I need to set for\nthis particular module.\n\n71\n00:03:36.094 --> 00:03:37.490\nNow, you can see,\nthere's not a lot involved.\n\n72\n00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.950\nLooks like it needs R host and R port.\n\n73\n00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.670\nYou can see that the name of the variable,\nwhat the current setting is, and\n\n74\n00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.575\nwhether or not it's required and\nthen a little description.\n\n75\n00:03:48.575 --> 00:03:51.610\nR-Host is the target, the remote host.\n\n76\n00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.010\nR-Port would be the port\non the remote host.\n\n77\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.752\nIf some of them'll need L-Host and\nL-Port, because that's be your local or\n\n78\n00:03:57.752 --> 00:03:59.790\nyour attacking machines.\n\n79\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.720\nThis one does not need any of that.\n\n80\n00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.320\nSo we're just gonna setup.\n\n81\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.170\nWe're gonna do a set rHost.\n\n82\n00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.821\nAnd my target is 10.0.100.99.\n\n83\n00:04:10.821 --> 00:04:13.461\nAnd then if I do another show options,\n\n84\n00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:18.255\nI'll see all of my required options\nare now configured, all right?\n\n85\n00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:23.080\nYou can also, there's a lot more you\ncan do with the Metasploit framework.\n\n86\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.500\nIt does include a database, and\nyou can tie in end map with it and\n\n87\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.750\nyou can run your scan from within MSF.\n\n88\n00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.830\nYou can say DB_NMAP and\nthen do your normal switches.\n\n89\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.560\nAnd it'll do the same scan,\nbut it dumps it in a database.\n\n90\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.354\nAnd then I can use commands like hosts,\n\n91\n00:04:39.354 --> 00:04:42.580\nand I can have all\nthe machines on my network.\n\n92\n00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.705\nAnd you can start filtering down and\nsay, hey look,\n\n93\n00:04:44.705 --> 00:04:47.229\nI wanna launch this exploit\nagainst all of my Linux machines.\n\n94\n00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.082\nOr it actually works out really good and\n\n95\n00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:51.790\nyou don't have to type in all\nthose options all the time.\n\n96\n00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.853\nYou can pull it right out of your\ndatabase, which is really cool.\n\n97\n00:04:54.853 --> 00:04:56.578\nBut that's not what we're going to do.\n\n98\n00:04:56.578 --> 00:04:59.780\nAs we've got it, we've set our R host.\n\n99\n00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.860\nWe're good to go there, and that's it.\n\n100\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.769\nOnce you've got all of your options\nconfigured, you can type in run or\n\n101\n00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:06.372\nexploit.\n\n102\n00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:11.622\nI'm gonna type run and see what happens.\n\n103\n00:05:11.622 --> 00:05:12.700\nI'm just letting it go.\n\n104\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.370\nExploit completed but\nno session was created.\n\n105\n00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.232\nInteresting, let's try that again.\n\n106\n00:05:18.232 --> 00:05:20.510\nThere we go.\n\n107\n00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.208\nThis time it says the backdoor\nbind listener is already open, but\n\n108\n00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:26.034\nat this time it did find a shell.\n\n109\n00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:28.865\nA little glitch somewhere in the network,\nmaybe something went wrong.\n\n110\n00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:31.984\nTry that again, everything looks good.\n\n111\n00:05:31.984 --> 00:05:34.170\n&gt;&gt; I'm kind of glad that\nhappened to be honest with you.\n\n112\n00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.550\nMike and I,\nwe do this security stuff for funs and\n\n113\n00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.050\ngiggles and\nobviously it's part of our job.\n\n114\n00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.310\nA lot of times when you try something,\nit might not work the first time through.\n\n115\n00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.470\nJust try again, especially,\nyou wanna verify that.\n\n116\n00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.360\nLike Mike said maybe\nthere's just a glitch.\n\n117\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.587\nMaybe there was some communication\nproblem on the wire.\n\n118\n00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:54.634\nGive it another shot.\n\n119\n00:05:54.634 --> 00:05:57.401\nMake sure you press Enter if something\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n120\n00:05:57.401 --> 00:05:58.660\n&gt;&gt; Throw a command at it.\n\n121\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.663\nDon't just take the fact that\nyou didn't see any output or\n\n122\n00:06:01.663 --> 00:06:06.147\neven if it errored as, well, I guess\nthat's not gonna happen, then you move on.\n\n123\n00:06:06.147 --> 00:06:07.677\nYou wanna play with it a little bit,\n\n124\n00:06:07.677 --> 00:06:10.898\nverify that it's actually not working\nbefore you move to something else.\n\n125\n00:06:10.898 --> 00:06:13.348\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's several times\nwhere I've seen an error pop up and\n\n126\n00:06:13.348 --> 00:06:16.079\nthen my cursor's just a little blinky\nover there, just a little blink.\n\n127\n00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:19.875\nYou type LS and you get a list of stuff\nthat's not on your machine, right?\n\n128\n00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:22.710\nAnd you're like it actually did work,\nright?\n\n129\n00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.580\nAll right, and let's see,\nwe could prove that.\n\n130\n00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.828\nI could type in ID.\n\n131\n00:06:26.828 --> 00:06:28.036\nIt looks like I am root.\n\n132\n00:06:28.036 --> 00:06:31.474\nIf I do host name you'll\nsee that is Metasploitable.\n\n133\n00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:36.770\nI could do an LS, I can start changing\ndirectories, navigating through here.\n\n134\n00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.170\nAnd seeing what else I can find.\n\n135\n00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.430\nIf this was a target of\nmy penetration test,\n\n136\n00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.350\nwell let me see where else I can go now.\n\n137\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.428\nFind information about how this machine\nknows about other machines on my network,\n\n138\n00:06:47.428 --> 00:06:50.399\nor there's password files on there,\nor secret documents,\n\n139\n00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:52.459\nall kinds of good stuff we could look for.\n\n140\n00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:56.156\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the best ways to verify\nthat you've actually rooted the box,\n\n141\n00:06:56.156 --> 00:07:00.087\nbecause some administrators get really,\nreally crafty in their hiding ways,\n\n142\n00:07:00.087 --> 00:07:04.020\nis make sure that you can actually view\nsomething like /etc/shadow, right,\n\n143\n00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.330\nif you're on a Linux box.\n\n144\n00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.914\nIf you're in Windows, grab something only\nan administrator can take a look at.\n\n145\n00:07:08.914 --> 00:07:13.072\nGo in System32 and see if you can modify\nsomething there or add something there.\n\n146\n00:07:13.072 --> 00:07:13.655\n&gt;&gt; Where is that?\n\n147\n00:07:13.655 --> 00:07:15.041\nI forget where the shadow file,\nis it in /etc/?\n\n148\n00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:17.349\n&gt;&gt; /etc/, yeah, /etc/shadow.\n\n149\n00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:18.025\nWe use KAT.\n\n150\n00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:21.523\n&gt;&gt; Although, I don't know that\nexploitable actually has-\n\n151\n00:07:21.523 --> 00:07:22.947\n&gt;&gt; It's a Linux box,\n\n152\n00:07:22.947 --> 00:07:24.820\nit's got a shadow file.\n\n153\n00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.131\n&gt;&gt; And yeah, there we go.\n\n154\n00:07:26.131 --> 00:07:29.321\n&gt;&gt; And now you can grab those and go\nbuck wild with your password cracker and\n\n155\n00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:30.600\nhave a good time.\n\n156\n00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.108\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nthose are my password dump right there.\n\n157\n00:07:33.108 --> 00:07:38.868\nAll right very cool, we'll exit out\nof that, we'll do a little Ctrl+C and\n\n158\n00:07:38.868 --> 00:07:44.232\nwe'll abort that session and\nwe'll clear up that screen.\n\n159\n00:07:44.232 --> 00:07:49.470\nAll right, now another trick with\nMetasploit is the back command\n\n160\n00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.740\nto get out of that particular exploit.\n\n161\n00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.279\nLet's try another one.\n\n162\n00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:56.850\nLet's see if we can take advantage\nof that unreal IRC Daemon.\n\n163\n00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:57.939\nSo, I'm gonna do the same thing.\n\n164\n00:07:57.939 --> 00:08:03.931\nI'm gonna search, For Unreal, IRCD.\n\n165\n00:08:03.931 --> 00:08:07.520\nSee what it comes back with.\n\n166\n00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.360\nAnd I've got a couple of them here.\n\n167\n00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:15.260\nI can see there is an exploit Linux\ngame 2004 and this is a secure overflow.\n\n168\n00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.780\nIt's got a good rating there.\n\n169\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.700\nThen I've got one that says\nunreal IRC daemon backdoor.\n\n170\n00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.910\nIt's got an excellent rating, I like that.\n\n171\n00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.350\nAnd this one is some kind of secure\noverflow as well; that looks like it's for\n\n172\n00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.310\na The Win32 system, yes.\n\n173\n00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.410\nSo that's in the Windows side of thing,\n\n174\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:38.040\ndefinitely not what I want here cuz my\ntarget is going to be a Linux machine.\n\n175\n00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.270\nSo same thing,\nI found the one I want to use.\n\n176\n00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:47.868\nNow it's just gonna be use exploit,\nunix IRC.\n\n177\n00:08:47.868 --> 00:08:52.520\nUnreal, IRCD 3281, back door.\n\n178\n00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.530\nNow to load it up, and\nI'll do my show options.\n\n179\n00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.860\nHere all I need is another R host and\nan R port.\n\n180\n00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.560\nNothing else for that one.\n\n181\n00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.160\nSo we'll go ahead and set that.\n\n182\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.380\nSo we're gonna do set R host And\n\n183\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.576\nI'll set that again to 10.0.100.99.\n\n184\n00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:18.530\nNow this particular one,\nI'm going to do another one,\n\n185\n00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.890\nI want to do a show Pay loads, okay.\n\n186\n00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.200\nOnce you have that module loaded up,\n\n187\n00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.370\nin the first one I forgot\nto run that command, but\n\n188\n00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.150\nthere was only one pay load allowed, or\none pay load included in that module.\n\n189\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.360\nYou can definitely write\nyour own pay loads.\n\n190\n00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.970\nBut this one has several\nthat I could choose from.\n\n191\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.930\nSo it really trys to, it depends on what\nI'm trying to do like see some double\n\n192\n00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.825\nreversed TCP using Talmat,\nreversed TCP using Pearl.\n\n193\n00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:48.460\nTheres' one reversed Ruby.\n\n194\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.060\nSo there's a few different ones that\ndepending on what you're trying to do or\n\n195\n00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.280\nyou might just have to try different\nones to see which one will Work.\n\n196\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.690\nAnd what's on that remote system?\n\n197\n00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.020\nFor us,\nI'm gonna do a Unix reverse Perl shell.\n\n198\n00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:07.410\nSo I'm gonna do set payload to,\nwhat is it?\n\n199\n00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.010\nCMD switch Unix.\n\n200\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:10.260\nOops.\n\n201\n00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.500\nThat is not how you spell Unix Mike.\n\n202\n00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.280\nAnd it should be reverse perl.\n\n203\n00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.390\nThere we go.\nAnd\n\n204\n00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.650\nyou can see down there that\nmy payload was indeed set.\n\n205\n00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.780\nSo now I've got my options set and\nI've got my payload set.\n\n206\n00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.160\nWe are just going to try\nto fire this guy off.\n\n207\n00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.050\nWe'll do a little run and\nwe'll see what happened.\n\n208\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:40.870\nAgain, I get the no session was created,\nso let's try that again.\n\n209\n00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.640\nNo session was created, that's too bad.\n\n210\n00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.620\nAlright, let's see if we can figure out,\nfailed to validate L Host.\n\n211\n00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.080\nLet's do a show options again and\ndid I miss that one there?\n\n212\n00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.100\nYeah, you know what,\nMike wasn't paying attention.\n\n213\n00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.330\nAnd I completely missed once\nI loaded up that payload\n\n214\n00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:01.250\nit changed what option I needed for\nthis particular exploit module to work.\n\n215\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.170\nSo there's a good learning point for you.\n\n216\n00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.780\nI meant to do that so\nyou could learn from my mistakes.\n\n217\n00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As we all look at Mike\n\n218\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:09.720\ngoing\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n219\n00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.670\nBut it was, it was a great learning point.\n\n220\n00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:16.280\n&gt;&gt; It was, exactly, so\nlet's go ahead and set that one.\n\n221\n00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.200\nIt works the same way, set LHOST.\n\n222\n00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.110\nIt's a reverse shell, so\n\n223\n00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.730\nit needs to know what IP address\nit's coming back to, right?\n\n224\n00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.950\nIt's gonna pick port 4444.\n\n225\n00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.480\nIf that one was being used,\nI could always do set L port, and\n\n226\n00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.670\nI could change that to something else.\n\n227\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.990\nMy local host here is ten\nzero one hundred one hundred.\n\n228\n00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.360\nNow I will do a little show options again.\n\n229\n00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.560\nAnd this time,\nit looks like everything is set.\n\n230\n00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.770\nSo we'll try this one more time.\n\n231\n00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.666\nWe'll do run Tells me I'm connected,\n\n232\n00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:52.220\nsending back to our command,\n&gt;&gt; Wait for it.\n\n233\n00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.190\n&gt;&gt; Jinx, you owe me a Coke.\n\n234\n00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n235\n00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.840\n&gt;&gt; And there we go, session two open.\n\n236\n00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.870\nI can see my addresses and my port\nnumber that we're connecting to and\n\n237\n00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.280\nfrom If I do a little id,\nI can see I've actually got root access.\n\n238\n00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:11.020\nIf I do a host name, I can assume that\nexploitable if we use Daniel's trick.\n\n239\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.540\nWe'll do a little cat.\n\n240\n00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.453\nSwitch etc, switch shadow.\n\n241\n00:12:17.854 --> 00:12:18.490\nAnd there it is.\n\n242\n00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.730\nSo you can verify that I've\nactually got root access.\n\n243\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.770\nAnd if I didn't,\nthat would be okay, right?\n\n244\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.620\nIt really depends on who\nis administrating that box.\n\n245\n00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.060\nLike in this case, the service is set up\nto run as the administrator account or\n\n246\n00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.900\nroot, which is obviously a bad thing.\n\n247\n00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:39.010\nMost places will have learned at least\nhow to harden a server by creating\n\n248\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.410\nan account that that service\nis going to run under and\n\n249\n00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.160\ngiving it only what that\nparticular service needs.\n\n250\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.810\nSo there could've been, where I compromise\nthis and I get in, And I found out.\n\n251\n00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:48.940\nI'm not rude.\n\n252\n00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.700\nThat's okay.\nThen we just start working on\n\n253\n00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.440\nother exploits.\n\n254\n00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.010\nNow that I've got access,\nit's just a matter of time before I can\n\n255\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.620\nfigure out how to escalate my privileges\nto get to that root level access.\n\n256\n00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.080\nSo, would not be too upset, I mean,\nif I wasn't root when I logged into here.\n\n257\n00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.100\nBut, in this case, the server's set up\nwhere everything's running under root So\n\n258\n00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.890\nit's nice and easy breezy.\n\n259\n00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.970\nAll right.\nWe'll go ahead and kill that session.\n\n260\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.230\nWe'll say yes for that one.\n\n261\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.870\nI'm going to back out of there.\n\n262\n00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:19.130\nIn fact, I'm just going to exit\nout of Metasploit all together.\n\n263\n00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.930\nAnd we're going to do one more thing.\n\n264\n00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.090\nBecause we want to show you another\nway to go about this, I guess.\n\n265\n00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.730\nIn fact, Daniel,\nwhy don't you explain this one?\n\n266\n00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.190\nI'll let you take over.\n\n267\n00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nNot a problem.\n\n268\n00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.780\nSo a while back I was playing around with\nMetasploit and we'll go into the things as\n\n269\n00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.320\nyou do and I thought,\nwell yeah it's nice to use Metasploitable.\n\n270\n00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.480\nOr not Metasploitable, Metasploit,\n\n271\n00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.740\nthe Metasploit framework,\nto break into things.\n\n272\n00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.660\nI saw it was extremely easy.\n\n273\n00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:47.530\nYou set a host, you set a port, you're\ngood to go, it jumps to the payloads, and\n\n274\n00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.120\nit creates a connection, and\nyou're in, right, very cool.\n\n275\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.820\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n276\n00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.440\nLove that.\n\n277\n00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.140\nRight?\nTotally love that.\n\n278\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.530\nBut I wanted to have a deeper\nunderstanding of what was going on.\n\n279\n00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.970\nMetasploit isn't doing that for me.\n\n280\n00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.960\nRight?\nIt's kind of doing it for\n\n281\n00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.180\nme in a lot of ways and I wanted to\nlearn more about what was happening.\n\n282\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:09.260\nSo I took one of these exploits that\nis available in Metasploit Just so\n\n283\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.410\nhappens to be this unreal i, r, c, one.\n\n284\n00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.110\nAnd figured, why is this working?\n\n285\n00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.690\nWhat is happening that\nmakes this connection work?\n\n286\n00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.480\nHow do I exploit this back door\nif I don't have med displayed?\n\n287\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.680\nSo I researched that, I researched\nwhat was going on and I figured in,\n\n288\n00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.270\nI wrote my own script that made this easy.\n\n289\n00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.120\nAnd now all I have to\ndo is point my script,\n\n290\n00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.210\nTo my target machine that is\nrunning this version of UnrealIRCd,\n\n291\n00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:37.360\nand I can make my own access to it\njust by creating my own script.\n\n292\n00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.690\nSo that will give you a deeper\nunderstanding of why things are working,\n\n293\n00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.400\nhow things are working cuz you have to\nunderstand the system a little bit better.\n\n294\n00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.120\nAnd as the hacker mindset in my brain,\nThat's what I want.\n\n295\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.510\nI want to know how these things work,\nso that I can A, exploit them and\n\n296\n00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.990\nplay with them and do whatever I feel like\ndoing, and B, just have a better knowledge\n\n297\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:00.160\nbase of how protocol servers and things\nlike that, of that nature, are working.\n\n298\n00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.790\nSo, this was a while ago, so it was\nactually last year when I did this, and\n\n299\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:10.310\nMichael was like, hey you must yeah\nI wrote a script actually to do that.\n\n300\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.480\nHe's like do you got that?\n\n301\n00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.170\nI said no I blew it away.\n\n302\n00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:18.305\nI'll rewrite it for you don't worry and\n30 minutes of me going how did I do this?\n\n303\n00:15:18.305 --> 00:15:23.210\nRe-remembering everything we got it\nbanged out I emailed it to Mike so\n\n304\n00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.970\nHe's gonna show you how to do\nthat right here, right now.\n\n305\n00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.360\nIt's pretty simple actually,\nit was basically just three or\n\n306\n00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.520\nfour lines of code.\n\n307\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, and we'll take a look at it.\n\n308\n00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:31.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look\n\n309\n00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:32.410\nat what you got in there.\n\n310\n00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.237\nSo let's take a look at\nyour hack.text there,\n\n311\n00:15:36.237 --> 00:15:38.290\nand what do we got going on there, Daniel?\n\n312\n00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:39.230\nNow there's-\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n313\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.360\nthis is basically our payload right here,\nright?\n\n314\n00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.670\nSo If you'll notice, it just basically\nis a Netcat command, with one caveat.\n\n315\n00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.030\nThe very beginning, right?\n\n316\n00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:52.726\nThat capital A, capital B,\nwith the semicolon.\n\n317\n00:15:52.726 --> 00:15:55.570\nSo the semicolon is\nthe delimiter of commands.\n\n318\n00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.964\nIf you wanna join multiple commands on\none line, And a Linux operating system,\n\n319\n00:15:58.964 --> 00:15:59.884\nyou use a semicolon.\n\n320\n00:15:59.884 --> 00:16:04.940\nSo if I wanted to do who am I,\n/cat/etc/shadow, something like that.\n\n321\n00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.666\nI would use a semicolon\nto limit those things.\n\n322\n00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:13.018\nThat AB is that backdoor command that\nwas built-in to that unreal IRCD.\n\n323\n00:16:13.018 --> 00:16:17.377\nI had to research and find out\nthat's what made this work, right?\n\n324\n00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:19.438\nThat's what Metasploit is doing.\n\n325\n00:16:19.438 --> 00:16:20.379\nIt's grabbing,\n\n326\n00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:24.450\nit basically pumping this into it using\nother means to create a connection.\n\n327\n00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.420\nHe's using a pearl connection cuz that's\nwhat Mike's payload was was pearl\n\n328\n00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:35.100\nbasically just creating a socket through\nTCP and allowing shell to be retrieved.\n\n329\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.100\nBut that AV command is really\nthe magic that makes this happen.\n\n330\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.760\nSo I created one file that had the string\nof text that I need to send the command\n\n331\n00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.760\nthat I need to make a Reverse Shell\nto a Netcat listener.\n\n332\n00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.740\nSo that's what is happening,\nit's calling home to Netcat and\n\n333\n00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.320\nbinding a Bash Shell to it.\n\n334\n00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.270\nNow Mike's opened up the actual script,\nand you'll notice it's just echoing\n\n335\n00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.380\nbasically, what server\ndo you wanna exploit?\n\n336\n00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:07.820\nAnd then it waits for you to tell it\nthe IP address or name of that server.\n\n337\n00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.152\nAnd then is says please wait,\nhacking, hacking, hacking,\n\n338\n00:17:11.152 --> 00:17:12.573\nI was having a little fun.\n\n339\n00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:14.475\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're such a nice-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n340\n00:17:14.475 --> 00:17:15.229\n&gt;&gt; Exploit writer.\n\n341\n00:17:15.229 --> 00:17:22.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and then it says,\nit's throwing, I'm echoing some commands.\n\n342\n00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:26.690\nThe problem I was having with it was I\ncouldn't get the command into the system\n\n343\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.590\nafter I made the connection\nto it using Netcat.\n\n344\n00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.573\nSo I was Netcatting into the IRC server,\nbut\n\n345\n00:17:32.573 --> 00:17:35.645\nI couldn't throw commands\nat it after that.\n\n346\n00:17:35.645 --> 00:17:37.990\nSo I was like, how do I get the commands,\nyeah, that's right.\n\n347\n00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.660\nYou echo, pipe that into Netcat, and\nthere you go, that's what's happening.\n\n348\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.990\nSo echo, USER is the command that I want\nto do, because you have to register with\n\n349\n00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:50.060\nthe IRC server before you're allowed\nto throw any other commands at it.\n\n350\n00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.618\nIt will not take commands\nuntil you've registered.\n\n351\n00:17:52.618 --> 00:17:57.185\nSo that's what the user hacker\nnot exclamation point, but\n\n352\n00:17:57.185 --> 00:17:59.660\nthe asterisks colon hacker is.\n\n353\n00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.100\nThat's me registering the hacker user, and\n\n354\n00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:08.190\nthat tying that into net cat,\ncreating a net cat connection.\n\n355\n00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.184\nI've got that input, right?\n\n356\n00:18:11.184 --> 00:18:12.120\nInput from a file.\n\n357\n00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.480\nIt's inputting my payload\nfrom that hack.text.\n\n358\n00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.110\nSo that's what's happening in a nutshell.\n\n359\n00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.800\nPretty straightforward.\n\n360\n00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:26.010\nIf you're not familiar with scripting or\nusing programing languages,\n\n361\n00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.030\nnot a big deal.\n\n362\n00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.816\nWe just wanted to give you a good idea\nthat these things are not unaccomplishable\n\n363\n00:18:32.816 --> 00:18:33.666\nby you as well.\n\n364\n00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:37.376\nThey're pretty simple, it wouldn't take\nsomebody very long at all to walk through\n\n365\n00:18:37.376 --> 00:18:39.896\nthat my little script and\nfigure out what was happening.\n\n366\n00:18:39.896 --> 00:18:41.158\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in the end,\n\n367\n00:18:41.158 --> 00:18:43.532\nthere's three lines of code there-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n368\n00:18:43.532 --> 00:18:44.065\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n369\n00:18:44.065 --> 00:18:45.660\nAnd they're pretty human readable lines-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n370\n00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.288\n&gt;&gt; Of code at that.\n\n371\n00:18:46.288 --> 00:18:50.084\nSo it's just the knowledge\nof figuring out what to do.\n\n372\n00:18:50.084 --> 00:18:51.700\nI'm gonna fire up a new window here.\n\n373\n00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.122\nI'll bump this up just a little bit,\nbut nothing exciting here.\n\n374\n00:18:54.122 --> 00:18:58.905\nI'm gonna do a little Netcat, because\nthe way Daniel's script is working, right?\n\n375\n00:18:58.905 --> 00:19:03.180\nIt's gonna reach out there and\nthen bind back a reverse shell.\n\n376\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.030\nI need a listener on my end\nthat's gonna accept that and\n\n377\n00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.460\nsay, look,\nhere comes that reverse shell I asked for.\n\n378\n00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:14.779\nSo we're gonna do Netcat, and I think\nyou told it, might as well do nvlp.\n\n379\n00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:22.480\nN for, no name, just IP addresses,\nV verbose, L listener, P port.\n\n380\n00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.205\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And then 9999,\n\n381\n00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:25.058\nI think-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n382\n00:19:25.058 --> 00:19:28.181\nI said it cuz it's just easy to hit 9999-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it.\n\n383\n00:19:28.181 --> 00:19:29.039\n&gt;&gt; That's me being lazy.\n\n384\n00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:31.088\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we'll fire that off and\n\n385\n00:19:31.088 --> 00:19:31.760\nthere we go.\n\n386\n00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.380\nNow I'm listening on any, cuz I didn't\nspecify an IP address in particular.\n\n387\n00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.433\nSo any of my network adapters,\n9999, should be now listening.\n\n388\n00:19:40.433 --> 00:19:43.406\nSo we'll flip back over to\nthis other terminal, and\n\n389\n00:19:43.406 --> 00:19:45.581\nwe'll actually execute his script.\n\n390\n00:19:45.581 --> 00:19:50.772\nOops, let's clear that screen so\nwe can get this back up to the top.\n\n391\n00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:55.531\nSo we'll do a little ./UnrealIRC_hack.sh,\nand\n\n392\n00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:58.817\nDaniel's wonderful coding there.\n\n393\n00:19:58.817 --> 00:20:01.220\nWhich Unreal IRC server\nwould you like to exploit?\n\n394\n00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.354\nSimply gonna type in 10.0.100.99.\n\n395\n00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.847\nPlease wait, hacking, hacking, hacking,\nand then looking up your host name.\n\n396\n00:20:10.847 --> 00:20:13.691\nAnd it kinda sits there, and that's\nwhen you're like well is is working,\n\n397\n00:20:13.691 --> 00:20:15.010\nis it not working, I don't know.\n\n398\n00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.529\nWhat's it doing?\n\n399\n00:20:16.529 --> 00:20:19.642\nWait, something happened.\n\n400\n00:20:19.642 --> 00:20:20.890\n&gt;&gt; If you look at your listener there.\n\n401\n00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.075\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at my listener and\nwhat do we got?\n\n402\n00:20:23.075 --> 00:20:28.463\nConnected to from, and\nthere is my Metasploitable box.\n\n403\n00:20:28.463 --> 00:20:32.170\nIf I start doing an ls,\nI can see all the files that are there.\n\n404\n00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.526\nIf we do, what?\n\n405\n00:20:33.526 --> 00:20:37.214\nAn id, looks like I am of root.\n\n406\n00:20:37.214 --> 00:20:41.842\nIf I do cat switch /etc/shadow,\n\n407\n00:20:41.842 --> 00:20:48.711\nthere's my shadow file,\nhow easy was that right?\n\n408\n00:20:48.711 --> 00:20:53.191\nAnd so another, just wanted to show you\nguys that you can take that stuff from\n\n409\n00:20:53.191 --> 00:20:55.366\nMetasploit that you learned there.\n\n410\n00:20:55.366 --> 00:20:58.979\nAnd then start actually\nwriting your own exploits.\n\n411\n00:20:58.979 --> 00:21:03.870\nNow it's funny that you were saying that\nthe AB is the characters that triggered\n\n412\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:04.898\nthat back door.\n\n413\n00:21:04.898 --> 00:21:08.620\nThe other one we were looking at,\nthe VSFTPD.\n\n414\n00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:15.090\nAnd the back door there was a smiley face,\ncolon, close, apostrophe.\n\n415\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.268\nSo if we were to look at that code again,\n\n416\n00:21:17.268 --> 00:21:21.306\nyou'd put a random string of seven\ncharacters into the username field.\n\n417\n00:21:21.306 --> 00:21:23.179\nAnd then put a colon smiley face, and\n\n418\n00:21:23.179 --> 00:21:26.141\nif there was a colon smiley\nface anywhere in the username,\n\n419\n00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:29.780\nthat would trigger that backdoor to\nexecute and give them that access.\n\n420\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.957\nSo it's always interesting to go through\nand start reading those exploits and\n\n421\n00:21:32.957 --> 00:21:35.590\nlooking at the code and\nseeing what they're actually doing in.\n\n422\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:36.550\n&gt;&gt; Hackers are funny people.\n\n423\n00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:37.954\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n&gt;&gt; They like to have a good time\n\n424\n00:21:37.954 --> 00:21:39.560\nwhen they are breaking into your stuff.\n\n425\n00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, why not?\n\n426\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.323\n&gt;&gt; Causing chaos.\n\n427\n00:21:41.323 --> 00:21:43.115\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've got to entertain yourself.\n\n428\n00:21:43.115 --> 00:21:45.347\n&gt;&gt; You do, you do.\n&gt;&gt; You are typically sitting in a dark\n\n429\n00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:47.370\nroom at computer for hours.\n\n430\n00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.678\n&gt;&gt; Your mom's yelling at you?\n\n431\n00:21:48.678 --> 00:21:50.265\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n432\n00:21:50.265 --> 00:21:53.487\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so hopefully that gives you\n\n433\n00:21:53.487 --> 00:21:56.890\na good idea of really what we can\ndo with some of this knowledge.\n\n434\n00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.936\nAnd it gave us a chance to\nkinda tie some of it together,\n\n435\n00:21:59.936 --> 00:22:01.936\nI know we didn't bring all of it in.\n\n436\n00:22:01.936 --> 00:22:05.968\nLog files and things like that, but\nthis is a good start to where we would go,\n\n437\n00:22:05.968 --> 00:22:07.800\nwe would start doing those scans.\n\n438\n00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:13.962\nIf we're trying to, let's say one of those\nvulnerabilities was compromised we'd\n\n439\n00:22:13.962 --> 00:22:17.736\nhave to start looking at log files,\nlooking at router log files.\n\n440\n00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:20.710\nTying it all together that's where\nthat big data analytics comes in.\n\n441\n00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:26.080\nTaking a look at those seem systems that\nallow me to bring it all in and write\n\n442\n00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.760\nnice filters and trim it down to something\nI can actually make sense out of and use.\n\n443\n00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.204\nWe get to see how we do scans.\n\n444\n00:22:34.204 --> 00:22:39.970\nAnd we saw how we can use the exploit\ndatabase and Metasploitable framework.\n\n445\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:45.122\nOr I'm sorry, not Metasploitable,\nthe Metasploit framework, to find exploits\n\n446\n00:22:45.122 --> 00:22:50.285\nthat can capitalize on the vulnerabilities\nthat we found from the scanning phase.\n\n447\n00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:53.470\nAnd then, yeah, we've got root access, so.\n\n448\n00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.626\n&gt;&gt; That's a day of sunshine right there.\n\n449\n00:22:55.626 --> 00:22:56.326\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what,\n\n450\n00:22:56.326 --> 00:22:57.850\nI almost bought this shirt the other day.\n\n451\n00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.757\nI saw it, it's not new, but I was like,\nI've gotta get that, it says,\n\n452\n00:23:00.757 --> 00:23:02.744\ninstead of the got milk,\nit's like, got root.\n\n453\n00:23:02.744 --> 00:23:03.260\n&gt;&gt; Got root?\n\n454\n00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.545\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that.\n\n455\n00:23:04.545 --> 00:23:07.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, but that's it.\n\n456\n00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:12.014\nIn a nutshell, that's our demonstration\nfor pulling all this together.\n\n457\n00:23:12.014 --> 00:23:15.510\n&gt;&gt; All right, well there you go,\nthat is the practicum of this, right?\n\n458\n00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.110\nThis is us taking what we've learned,\nthrowing it into practice,\n\n459\n00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:23.300\nseeing how we can use these things and\na kind of a real life situation.\n\n460\n00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.895\nObviously hopefully, you don't have\nMetasploitable as a production machine\n\n461\n00:23:26.895 --> 00:23:28.082\npointed to the Internet.\n\n462\n00:23:28.082 --> 00:23:30.220\nThat's a bad thing,\nwe don't want to do that.\n\n463\n00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.711\nBut if you do have production machines,\nand you do want to test them.\n\n464\n00:23:33.711 --> 00:23:37.580\nYou do wanna do maybe a small type of\npen test, or in a sandbox environment.\n\n465\n00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.312\nNow you kind of see the methodology,\nwhat it takes to go through that.\n\n466\n00:23:41.312 --> 00:23:44.889\nIt is very extensive,\nas you get more involved in it.\n\n467\n00:23:44.889 -->
